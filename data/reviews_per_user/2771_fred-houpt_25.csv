The New World," Completely overwhelming experience
","I own 'The Thin Red Line' and I've watched it a few times and so I have a feeling for what Malick can do with images. What struck me on the first viewing of TNW is that it appears from one angle to be a continuation of an extended meditation in film that began (at least to my limited knowledge) with TTRL. The shots upward into the trees, the swaying effects of the wind on grasses and leaves; the movement, constant movement of water, trees, air, waves in the ocean. If you keep TTRL in your mind when you watch TNW you'll feel a similar pulse, a similar eye that is looking and thinking and creating. Malick is not just presenting history; this is the backdrop, so it would seem. The point of his movies is to draw us all deep, very deep into the mystery and drama of life; how random it can all seem amidst so much chaos, so orderly amidst so much destruction; how tender amongst so much darkness. Malick is not interested in the mindless Hollywood that gives you gratuitous blood, lots of noise and after it is over you forget, you are hardly touched, the fantasy is as important as a bowl of popcorn. Malick is taking life and drawing us into the minds of those who are stretched out like paint on a canvas. We either sit still and are touched or we walk out of the cinema, unable to stand something that is substantial, that is philosophical, that is putting us through deep empathy right into the lives of the actors. If you are up that close you can suddenly get goosebumps, in sympathy with the moment, somehow you too are there. How often does this happen in our movie experiences? Like almost never, right? Let's get back to the basics of the film. Is it historically accurate? Not really. I did some reading up on 'Pocahontas' and her story, after I had watched the film. American history has heaped a lot of layers of embellishments on her story and that happens all the time to characters who are put high on pedestal's, who are exaggerated into larger than normal, larger than life proportions. She did exist, that's for sure. However, there seems to be some consensus that she did not have the sort of romantic relationship that is depicted in this movie. I think it is wrong to put the microscope of historical reality to this film; I don't think Malick had a documentary in mind. If he did then the movie would be worthy of such criticism and analysis. Instead what we have here is a powerful drama that just sweeps you away.I am now remembering the effect that 'The Mission' had on me. In that film de Niro's character pulls so much of the story on to his back that almost everyone else in the film is subservient to his suffering. The natives in that film, for sure, are just pretty eye-candy and have little direct contact with moving the plot along. In TNW the native American's are directly engaged in the development of the plot and in the middle of that tension Pocahontas endures. What is elemental and pure in TNW is that there is a spark of love between Smith and her and though he runs from it and her, she cannot deny what they shared.It is a complicated drama because in this version of the story she is very attached to Smith whereas in reality she might not have been. Nevertheless, the story is told with great sensitivity and we mourn her losses as they accumulate. Hers is a sad story and it never abates, even after her seeing Smith again.What we are left with are the images, the depiction of the Powhatten natives, their impressions of the Europeans and how filthy, uncouth and foul the Europeans appear. There are layers of loss of innocence and Malick knows that a modern viewer might be unaware that the conquest of the United States came at the terrible suffering of the natives. Perhaps it is this and less the length of the film that makes people so uncomfortable with this film? There are many long scenes that have no dialog. None is needed. We are just so acclimatized to verbal dialog, too much talking. Can we please remember that movies began with 'silent' films, where people expressed with their eyes, there facial gestures. The young actress Q'Orianka Kilcher is able to emote depths of feeling that just make words unnecessary. The same is true for Smith (Colin Ferrel). He does not need to speak much. Malick has them 'act' with their eyes. For me this just added to the poetry of his film.I was just blown away by this movie. It is a deeply sad film but Pocahontas's story is that way. Malick has again painted a movie rather than just go through the motions. The soundtrack is as overwhelming as the visual images. To quote from another review on Amazon: 'The use of Wagner's Vorspiel from the opera Das Rheingold, along (with) Mozart's famous Piano Concerto #23, are stunning and essential elements to this remarkable film.'So I will stop for now as there is much more to be said. I want to watch it again a few times more. This is a very powerful and wonderful film that is worth the appreciation of a fine opera, symphony or art on a huge canvas. Wonderful.",10,2,5,25 December 2006
Captain Phillips," Nail biting drama delivers a full cargo load
","First of all, in my view, if Mr. Hanks were to be seen in 2 or 6 films per year and they were as good as this one then all of them deserved a full menu of award nominations. That the Academy decided that Mr. Hanks was to be overlooked for best actor award shows once again that it has had its rudder shot off and it is adrift. More than this, the Academy, to which Hanks has graced so many films, honouring the craft of acting, has shown that it is without sense and is not above trashing one of its greatest stars. Shame on the Academy.This is a really good action adventure based on a true story. There are so few weak points in this drama that they do not merit mention. To say that the end of the film is one of Tom Hank's finest film moments would not be so much of a spoiler as a loud standing ovation. This is why we love this man. A deeply disturbing film on some levels, stolen as it is from the yearly toll of hijacked shipping both in the Somali arena and in other areas of the world. Cargo carriers are forbidden to carry arms, which they could use to defend themselves. Hence, so many are taken over by gun wielding pirates of the seas. This film is not in defence of or is a critique of why Somali's take to the oceans to launch piratical attacks. It is a drama that forces human beings into collision courses, with long premeditated plans tossed overboard, with chaos coming down all around. This is the world we live in and it is not pretty. I would watch any film with Tom Hanks in it. He is a joy to watch. The Somali actors were also very convincing. As I say, a very well done drama and worth award considerations.",10,0,1,4 February 2014
Star Trek," A fitting and exciting prequel. Well worth the price of admission
","At my age I can attest to having watched the first series, Shatner/Kirk and Nimoy/Spock, etc. I loved the first series and I grew up watching all the rest. Looking back at the original series now, seen in the current context of powerful computer CGI and mock-up modeling at a high level, the first series is almost painfully amateur to watch. Having said all that, it was the first and it dealt with its story, its special effects as a made for television show that the networks killed off just as it was capturing an audience. Now, in mid 2009 we see a terrific depiction as a prequel to the first series.There are several really big problems for this film and I'll give them now. The first series had the most minimal computer graphics that the cameras showed. This prequel shows off computer chops that look to be about 100 years more advanced than they should. That was a choice the director took and although it makes no sense to those of us who knew what the original looked like, I suppose the alternative of showing an even more crude and undeveloped technology in this film would have looked, well, boring to the eyes of a current audience who use computers much more complicated than the original show; if you follow me....Second, the twists in the plot (I won't spoil it) are so ridiculous and utterly impossible, that all one can do is say, well, this is a movie and it's all made up and fictional, so why not just throw rational thought out the window? The saving grace to this film is the depiction of the original cast as younger men and woman, who now all appear like gleaming, young, revved up hot rods, ready to kick some serious ass as they boldly go. You get the picture. The script is not the winner here nor are the predictable badder than bad bad guys. The real kick that this film has in spades is a relentless plot that does not rest for more than a minute or two at best. The blistering pace this film achieves just moves you along, never letting you think too long about what people just said or how preposterous the plot just got. It is just more go, go, go, and then more. That is what an action picture fantasy like this demands and the cast and director deliver. Don't bother trying to make sense of the plot; not even Spock's vaunted logic could deal with that. A really fun time at the movies and a very plausible, if over horse-powered, prequel crew. Terrific fun and a keeper once the DVD comes out. What a hoot.",9,3,9,17 May 2009
The Great Dictator," One of Chaplins best!!!
","As a die-hard fan of Charles Chaplin, my primary devotions are to his best material, which for me are all the silent films. I believe that he himself had a clear intuition that something would dissipate were he to switch to talking films. This is not to say that he did not produce wonderful 'talkie' films. He did and The Great Dictator (TGD) is one of his best. Perhaps his greatest film, 'Modern Times' has a bit of speaking in it and of course his wonderful impromptu song filled with gibberish words. We don't think of this as a 'talking' film in the same way that TGD is; this was his first all talking film. I still prefer the silent films for several reasons. His true genius lay in suggestions brought about ONLY by facial expression. He had no peer who could evoke what his face could; remember that Keaton was known as 'stone face' and never, ever broke his facial expression, no matter what. Chaplin's silent evocations also relied on incredible physical agility and body humor that is still hilarious today.TGD still uses quite a bit of physical humor and it all works well. TGD is a scathing indictment of fascism in Europe, ending as it does with a phenomenal and hair raising speech, spoken out of character, where Chaplin addresses himself to all of humanity. It is also a sad, shocking and disturbing drama filled with bits of humor that are as dark as Chaplin knew how to express.Consider his physical humor for a moment. In the early part of the film when the plane crashes, Chaplin emerges from complete submersion in a huge pile of wet mud. His entire head is enveloped in mud as he pops his eyes open - I really don't know how he did that without blinding himself. The scene is incredible and although it lasts for a few moments, it shows to what extremes he was willing to go to produce a laugh. Consider the scene in the ghetto where his lady friend, in trying to help him, accidentally bops him quite hard on the head with a frying pan.In his depiction of the Hitler-like leader, Hinckle, there is one scene that must go down as one of the most breathtaking and marvelous in all movie history. It comes when he is alone in his room and plays with a huge inflatable globe of the world, bouncing it up and down, catching it and bouncing it sometimes off his rear end. The symmetry of his movements as lithe as anything a top ballet dancer could have done. The scene lingers in the mind, having deeper meaning than the surface action. Chaplin was blessed with a deep insight into people and this film shows him at his razor sharpest.Another reason this film is so important: in a time when almost all of the world had turned it's back on the racial genocide that Nazi Germany was perpetrating on Europe's Jews, Chaplin knew of it and was convinced that something brave must be said about it. Where almost no one, certainly in Hollywood, thought it important to say that the Jews were getting massacred, Chaplin brought the Jewish focus front and center and miraculously, in a funny sort of way. Even though the rest of the world was to discover after the war that the destruction of Jews was far more sinister and horrific than this film implies, at least Chaplin stood up and shouted about it.This is a brave, moving, brilliant, scathing, insightful, compassionate and raucous movie. Chaplin's portrayal of Hinckle, where he moves in and out of a Germanic accent, shows that a great silent film actor could move quite successfully into the talking movies. His Hitlerian rants were often so similar to Hitler's own that it was amazing to see that Chaplin could be vocal mimic as well. A complex film that holds up very well. A must see for all Chaplin fans.",9,5,8,30 September 2007
The Killing Fields," The true heart of darkness
","Periodically in the history of warfare there arises situations that seem to be of transcendent madness and darkness. While Vietnam was already a fully developed and unnecessary war, the civil war that erupted in Cambodia has only the European Holocaust as perpetrated by the Nazi's to be more evil. It is estimated that over 2 million people died as a result of the Khmer Rouge. The levels of brutality that Cambodians foisted upon one another is breathtaking in it's scope and depth. The wholesale slaughter of intellectuals, the educated professionals only touches upon the torment that tore apart an entire nation. The forcible relocation of millions of people into death/labor camps where brainwashing and starvation were applied with a ferocious evil; one can only wonder if death was gladly welcomed when it came. Life itself was for a time so bleak, so hopeless, so many cut off from any outside help, almost all nations having had their embassies forced closed, staff evicted; it beggars the imagination to wonder how this happened? Years later, Robert McNamara admitted that he and those around him (during the war) totally misunderstood the Vietnamese and their intentions. What was even more galling was the secret bombing of Cambodia (as ordered by Nixon and Kissinger). The relentless spread of war from Vietnam into bordering countries only looks like the spread of a virus. That the US played their deadly game of seeking an exit with honor at the expense of millions of Vietnamese and by extension, Cambodians, is a very dark spot in American history. The film is graphic in it's depiction of the horrors of the war. There are many scenes that haunt the mind long after the film is over. All the actors give excellent performances, especially Haing S. Ngor. His recreation of suffering is heartbreaking to watch. It is even more heartbreaking to shed a tear for him at the end of the film when you learn of the senseless death he suffered - the real person, in real life just a few years ago. All in all it is a depressing film because it is so close to the truth. It is a story of ambition and courage, chaos and survival. Cambodia is one of the poorest nations on the planet, and it is something of a miracle that the country survives. Why such horror happens in such poor places (think of Haiti as another example) is hard to calculate. Many countries have undergone civil wars; this one was one of the very worst in recent world history. The film is an anguished cry and is a fitting testimony to true darkness.",8,2,4,19 March 2007
The Caine Mutiny," This mutiny has not aged well
","Having not seen this film or having read the novel, I approached it with no preconceived notions other that so many on IMDb have given the film so many accolades. Alas, I will not be joining that group. Watching this film in early 2012 I was confronted with a depiction that was overtly jingoistic and so fawning towards the US Navy, that I found the preening gestures to be detracting, robbing the story of any possible objectivity in the story telling. While I am not unaware that every film will mirror the times in which it is crafted, I found the musical score to be mediocre and too strenuously fixated with reproducing a gallant and martial atmosphere. Subtlety this film had none. Some critics have noted and I will agree with them that the first half of the film really drags. I also feel that the romantic peregrinations of Ensign Willie Keith are unnecessary, weakly depicted and developed. Watching it now made me cringe, with the watered down tension of his divided loyalties towards his mother and the woman he asserts he is in love with just comes across as unconvincing, drained of real passion, conviction and angst. It doesn't help the movie that the two actors playing the roles had practically no sparks between them. That entire part of the film, even if it is in the book, could have been left out.My impression of Bogart as the mentally unhinged Captain was that he was miscast for this role. Bogey, for me at least, was too wooden, stiff, an obvious land lubber trying to make himself look like a seasoned sea dog and I didn't buy it for a moment. I kept on waiting for him to pop a cigarette in his mouth but not once is he seen smoking, which, as hilarious as it might sound from a health point of view, was his trade mark in so many of his films. Another thing I was quite surprised at was how short he was. Every time he stood beside Van Johnson or Fred MacMurray, both quite tall men, Bogey look so much smaller, which of course he was.Much has been made of his recourse to fidgeting with with balls of some metal, and even if it is in the novel, the way he acts this out looks contrived and with no subtly. Imagine if it was Charles Laughton portraying this captain as he had on the film 'Mutiny on the Bounty'? Bogart's Captain is portrayed more as someone who is severely anal retentive, given to ridiculous attention to details that have about as much place on a minesweeper as they would on a chain gang. That type of spit and polish with harsh consequences for insubordination belonged on a big battle ship, not a rusting hulk.I found the emotional projections of every single person in the film to be too cautious, unnatural, forced, self conscious of being an 'act'. Fred MacMurray, a talented actor, hardly breaks away from his monochromatic portrayal, and strangely so. The only person in the film who evoked a few moments of real emotion was Jose Ferrer, whose sneering revulsion for the defendants is a welcome jolt of a real moment of conviction.A word about special effects and stock footage. The film used three sources to show the boats. One was shot either on a stage or on a real boat, another was stock footage from WW2 and the weakest was the model ship being shot in a large tub. The model scenes looked at today will only make you laugh. I suppose that in 1954 people didn't much care if the ship looked like a toy; they focused on the overall story. I am someone grown accustomed to quality effects and looked at now, the storm tossed boat looks silly and amateurish. The premise of the drama is not impossible to conjure but I felt that it lacked enough life and death held in the balance to convince me. Bogart's reaction to seeing the mutinous defendants outside the court room was typical of how odd the relationships were. He was not the least bit perturbed by seeing them and he greeted them as friends. The court room drama was the strongest part of the film and I will grant that watching Bogart's character fall apart was the climax of the film. However, it was a short moment in what is otherwise a rather dreary and muted film. You would think that the actions taken in the middle of a typhoon to save everyone on board from imminent drowning would have evoked a stronger reaction from all concerned but you won't find it here. I was bothered that the film does not tell you what became of Bogart's character, Captain Queeg. All that we know is that the defendants won their case and that Queeg lost. I found the lack of follow through to be a weak point. All in all, the film looks very dated, the actors all look devoid of conviction and by comparisons to other boat films, this one is flat. Not impressed. Go and look at what Laughton and Gable did on the other Mutiny film and then you'll see action worth writing accolades for. Not here.",5,3,13,7 January 2012
Cold Mountain," Fabulous film
","I watched the film for the second time, this time on DVD. I was again totally swept away by this passionate drama. After having seen it the first time I read the book and fell in love with the whole project all over again.What a great book and what a heart wrenching film. Such a sad story but so well told and generally honest to the book. The DVD has a second disc that is devoted to the making of the film and has an especially wonderful live performance done a few days after the film opened to a big audience. In the performance are most of the cast and all of the singers. The music alone is worth getting the soundtrack to. I tell you, this is one of my all time favourites and I intend to buy the DVD. A violent film for sure but honest to the civil war history. When asked if it was an anti war film the comment of the music director was that it was an 'anti-fear' film. Something to bear in mind in the post-911 America. Superb film.",Null,0,0,10 August 2004
Apocalypse Now," Still one of the best
","I have seen several versions of this film. Years ago, when it first came out, in the theater, several times. A year or so ago I went to the theater to watch the newly edited and much longer version that had all that extra material added on. I just recently purchased a very inexpensive VHS version of the original; this version had the ending without the bombardment.So, I've seen most of the iterations of this film. I want to first comment on the extra long version that came out recently. For me the extra hour or so of added material just added weight that was totally unnecessary to the plot. It made the film too long and the plot diversions with the French added nothing but padding. Willard's character didn't need to visit with them and so I was left wondering why it was included. I understand that legend has it that Coppola shot about 200 hours of film. Heck, with all that extra stuff lying around, I guess the temptation to put it back was too great. The extra material with the Playboy bunnies was useless.Watching the original again reminded me of how much I did not like the soundtrack. OF course I liked the Wagner and The Doors. The rest was just awful to my ears. I found that the only redeeming factor that the longest version has over the others is the outstanding colors that come out in the fresh print. The additional material with Robert Duval was silly and not necessary. As well the additional Brando scenes did not add to the 'darkness' but detracted by making his appearance seem too normal.The actors: for me what is sad is that the film is really Martin Sheen's best opus of his entire career. While nearly dying in the process of making it, he gave as much gut wrenching inner being in this film as Brando gave in Last Tango. What I cannot grasp is that most critics talk about the colors or the amount of money or the travails of shooting the film and very little on Sheen's contribution. It is, after all, his journey into the darkness and it is mostly through his eyes that we frame our thoughts. Sheen's characterization of the descent into chaos and hell is as good a performance as a human being could have given. He reflects the full 'horror' of hell without the slightest hint of over-acting or romanticism. Brando, it is reported, had not read 'Heart of Darkness', which is a bit hard to believe, in that he was very well read. He had not read the script but upon doing so hated it and continually argued with Coppola. That's Brando for you. It is said that it was Brando's idea to be shot in shadows for the majority of his time and in this I think he was dead on. It is a big shame that instead of having Brando's 45 minute improvisation that was edited out of the final edition, Coppola instead put in the extra rubbish as I've reported above. I bet you that the Brando material, if it ever sees the light of day, will prove to be far and away more interesting and captivating than the extra stuff that was added on. Brando as an improvisational actor had no peer and only a few could come close to his levels. Imagine watching 45 minutes of a man descend into his own hell.In closing, the original film even though not as visually stunning as the re-edited cut of last year was a far better product in it's slimmer format. The story, while still a bit loose holds together whereas the longer version gets sidetracked into paths we don't need to tread. The entire supporting cast is superb and of course Duval just chews up the scenery in all his moments. While still a really great film, the soundtrack bothered me quite a bit and so it's not a 10. It is a film that looks better if you've read Conrad and are familiar with those themes. Coppola almost succeeds to create the film this could have been; the result is still very much worth absorbing if only for the searing paths of hell Sheen walks.",9,0,2,12 September 2006
No Country for Old Men," Astounding, jarring, jolting, deeply troubling
","As as big Coen brothers fan I had to go see it. Which I did last night on the big screen. I found myself walking out of the theater on trembling legs and queasy stomach. As a well crafted vehicle this is the Coen brothers finest achievement, even eclipsing the much lauded 'Fargo'.I recall John Goodman's portrayal of a psychopathic killer in Barton Fink and how uncomfortable he made me feel; his hypnotically executed persona made your skin crawl.In '...old men'...Javier Bardem perhaps even surpasses Goodmans nightmarish and very frightening evocation of pure evil. Bardem lurches through the film and he reminds me now, when I think of it, of what I think the 'golem' must have looked like. The 'Golem' was a mythic creature, supposedly created by the Maharal of Prague in the 16'th century, in Prague. This creature was something that did not have a human soul but was sort of like a demon, conjured up and controlled by Kabbalistic means. In any case, Bardem looked like a demon who had not a single molecule of humanity in his blood.There are several things that disturb when you watch. The need to make sense out of an action is what makes us humans rational. When you watch random and inscrutable acts of violence we are upset because it challenges our normative states. If you dwell on it, what is so off-setting is that this violence is so reminiscent of nightmares that scare us so badly we wake up in a heart pounding sweat. That's what you feel when you watch Bardem.I read somewhere that Bardem is not an English speaker. If so, then perhaps he spoke all his lines phonetically. (I read the same of the two lead actors in 'Crouching Tiger...' that they too did not speak the language of the film and they had to phonetically deliver the lines). Bardem's approach to his lines is to deliver them with a freaky coldness. His voice implies that he feels completely in control, completely sure of the outcome and not touched by any outcry from his victims. That he might kill randomly is something he cares nothing to notice. His character is a nightmarish ghoul come to life.This is a very violent film and children should be protected from watching this at any time now or in the future. It is difficult enough for us adults to have our nerves jangled and shocked. This is a film with an excellent script, all actors working at their best, knowing, it would seem, that this was a momentous and very important undertaking.Closing off for now, I would have to say that Tommy Lee Jones gives one of the most outstanding performances of his long career. What a fabulous actor's actor; our attention never leaves the baggy eyed face. That voice, so finely honed, so perfectly under his emotionally controlled output....we are in his grip. His grip is our conscience; the grip of Bardem is the grip of the unconscious. This film, this story is as about as disturbing as it gets. There is no resolution, but neither is there one when we awake from a traumatic nightmare. Not a film for the weak hearted or delicate nerves. A film that will haunt the mind for a long time. Not one I really want to see again too soon.",10,1,5,14 January 2008
Zulu," Good but not great
","A friend suggested I take the film out. I have very little knowledge of the conflict in South Africa so I have few preconceived notions. I was told that this is a true story which is always a good thing. Now, for the movie, I found the scenery beautiful to look at, often quite awe inspiring. The Zulu warriors and their lady folk looked about as authentic as I would expect, with nothing looking contrived. The ritual group marriage dancing was quite interesting. The main battle sequences were quite stirring, with the sounds of many warriors singing and chanting. Truly one gets a shiver up the spine at the sound of thousands of warriors viciously beating their spears into the back of their shields.Where I found the film to appear dated and weak were in the up close contacts between the British soldiers and the Zulu warriors. It must have been a difficult or impossible task given to the director to make up close film of people getting speared all over their bodies without showing realistic looking wounds. On the scale of that battle that would have been one huge cost to re-create. Perhaps given this, the director opted for fake jousting and fake puncturing. This resulted in people falling over just about as soon as some pointy object touched them and this really looked silly. Sure guns were going off in all directions but again when Zulu's were shot it had all the hallmarks of a school play in grade 5. It was just not believable. I know, I've been jaded with the many years of watching Hollywood big budget movies that spare no money in creating real death scenes. Perhaps it should have been left as it was, rather than the eye popping stomach churning sounds and look of death that say 'Saving Private Ryan' gave us. OK, so call me a complainer.I did not enjoy Michael Caine's portrayal as I found it confusing. He is at times effeminate, remote, too quiet, boyish, a dandy, and on the other hand can bark out orders with as much salt as the best of the boys. I could not follow what his personality was trying to create.Jack Hawkins gave his usual flawless characterization even if that of a crazed religious/drunkard.The film to my eyes looks a wee bit faded at the edges. You look at Gallipoli (the film) and you can see how much more superior the final product was. Different times, different director. I know. Still, an interesting historical piece.",6,3,18,18 March 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg revisits WW2 with heroic honors
","1993 saw the premier of 'Schindler's List', Spielberg's bracing and emotionally scorching story about Oskar Schindler. 1998 he re-visits World War 2 and produces an equally powerful story about the saving of one man's life in the midst of post D-day battles. It is an appropriate temptation to compare his two seminal WW2 films, both such very powerful dramatic stories. Both concern themselves with salvation, with Schindler on the large scale and Ryan just one man. In the process of saving the many Jews he did Schindler was also somewhat successful in redeeming the moribund humanity within him. Tom Hanks' character in Ryan (Cpt. John Miller) does not need personal redemption or salvation because he is a good man who does not shirk from the weight of difficult missions and onerous responsibilities. However, in the midst of what appears to be an utterly mad task by his crew, we do wonder if any of them are transformed in a positive way? We know from the opening moments of the film that Private Ryan himself lived the remainder of his life with doubt as to whether the risk to save him and the cost to the small band of soldiers was worth the price paid? Carrying the survivors guilt heavily upon his shoulders, Ryan greatly struggles to lift the doubts as he confronts Miller's grave. It is a question that Spielberg leaves in an ambiguous state, left for the viewer to contemplate.As a drama I found the script believable, even if within the confines of a very important battle it stretches credibility to imagine that it could have happened. I do not know if it is in whole or partially based on a true story. I just had to accept that it might have happened even if far fetched. Spielberg has almost no peer as a story teller in film. I am reminded of the moment in the film where Miller thinks he has found the correct Pvt Ryan, proceeds to tell the hapless soldier the bad news, sits and watches him take the news with a wincing pain and then finds out he has the wrong man. The emotional roller coaster is incredibly wrenching to watch and think about. The actors handle it superbly and to Spielberg's credit, once the point has been made the scene moves on, with the story lurching forward to the point, the finding of Ryan.The special effects have been the subject of much praise. I'd have to say that the opening sequence is about as shocking and gruesome a depiction of war in it's ferocious misery as you can imagine. It sets the tone for what is to come; much close at hand battles and a lot of people dying. As the great Civil War Union General Sherman was known to have said: 'You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I will. War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it.' and 'There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all Hell.' These sentiments overhang the entire movie and limit the usual tendency of Spielberg to drift into sentimentality. We are given enough of an immersion into the gore of war and all that remains is hell.The movie wants to focus on Tom Hanks and from some points of view it does. However, I think that this is the obvious reaction. You watch this film a few times and you begin to notice how many fascinating and well developed characters come to life. There is so much room in this film to be inclusive and generous with character development and Spielberg takes full advantage. Even the German soldier that Miller saves (another soul saved at the least opportune time, in the most surprising of circumstances) remains much more than a cipher. He returns to duty and the duty is to kill Allied soldiers. Was Miller a dreamy fool, a morally rigid person? Why did he let the soldier go free when the battle had cost him a very valuable soldier in his unit? What is Spielberg saying here? Why save this man's life and also save Pvt Ryan's life? It is left unexplained and even as that characters resolution comes, we are left scratching our heads, wondering what to make of it. I think that ambiguity is appropriate for the madness of the battle. When in extreme moments of great stress, people often reach decisions that they would never consider if posed in a quiet moment. All of this sits firmly within the overall question that hangs over the film. Should Pvt Ryan be saved and at what cost? Should the German soldier not be saved and why shouldn't he have been taken prisoner to be given over to authorities later on? In one his strongest and finest roles, surrounded by outstanding actors who all deliver 100%, given a huge landscape full of boffo special effects, Tom Hanks carries an important film forward into a tragic but believable ending. War is the great leveler and who survives and who dies is an imponderable question. Coming away from this emotionally draining film, we do wonder. A classic, worthy of all it's awards. Stick around for the credits as John Williams ends the movie with a very stirring choral piece.",10,1,2,26 March 2008
The Pianist," Relentless, harrowing tale of survival
","There is a certain hallmark in a Polanski film and I have used the words 'relentless' and 'harrowing' out of respect and observation. Polanski often wields his art in challenging, aggressive and disturbing ways. Some have complained that his predilection to violence and blood are sometimes a bit much. However, though this film has all of that and then some, the sum of the parts is equal to the incredible story of Wladyslaw Szpilman. Having not heard of him before, the first time I saw this film I was shocked on many levels. As a Jew, of course, I had a hard time keeping my eyes on the screen as the details of Nazi brutality were presented like a hard slap on the face. As a pianist myself, I was stunned at how I had missed this mans story and amazed at how good he was as an artist.There will always be comparisons made by critics when a so-called holocaust movie is made. People draw lines, in this case, to Schindler's List and other fine films. It is odd, isn't it, that Schindler's story took place in Crackow and this film in Warsaw and in each case we feel that humanity had reached the nadir point of misery. Of course that is not true: the death camps, where so many ended up, were the bottom of the pit. 'The Pianist' shows us the story of the great Warsaw Jewish population and how it was rounded up, put to work, then obliterated or shipped to death camps. The Warsaw Ghetto uprising was one of the few occasions during the war when Jews rose up against the Nazi war machine. But let me return to the movie as such.I have no doubts in my mind that the hand of fate came to protect Szpilman. The obvious philosophical question then becomes: why him and not his whole family? It's an impossible question when we ask it but the whole film begs the question. It is an imponderable conundrum but for me the hand of fate was as plain to see as anything. His survival comes in many flavors. He is aided by the hated 'capos', the Jewish police in the ghetto. He is helped by artists in the Christian community who knew of his own fame and took enormous risks to help him as best they could. He was assisted by the Polish underground. Finally, in the most moving part of the film, he is aided in the most unexpected manner, by a high ranking German officer, who, upon discovering him hiding in a totally bombed out quarter of the city (we never know why the officer was there, seeing that the blocks and blocks of city were reduced to total rubble)....asks him to play the piano for him; incredibly he plays and to break your heart. The officer inexplicably has sympathy for him and provides him with food and in the end his own winter coat. Our emotions by this time are so overwrought with seeing what Szpilman had suffered that to see him saved yet again by a German soldier.....leaves us raw.This film has the look and feel of what it must have been like, Polanski having taken pains to hold little back in terms of the brutality, random murder and deprivation of such huge numbers of people. Adrien Brody, what can you say of this performance? He is one of those rare number of actors who can say everything with their eyes. Giancarlo Gianini always does that. Brody often reduces his thoughts and feelings into wordless cries that pour out of his eyes; if you cannot feel moved to tears when he says nothing then you just don't have the receptors to pick it up. To say that his evocation of Szpilman was sensational is too weak a summary. Would that more actors could reach into their souls to pull together such depth, cinema would be graced with more masterpieces. This film is so powerful I doubt we have the ability to drink it all in in one go. So richly deserving of the 3 Oscars. Brodie's performance is so staggering, he will probably not eclipse it again. A monumental story of survival amidst mountains of death, destruction and heart break. A rare cinema event indeed.",10,3,6,27 June 2007
Into the Wild," Very fine movie, disturbing theme
","I have not read the book so this is the first impression of the story through the movie. I recognize in Penn a director who continues to mature, grown and learn his craft. I don't want to focus on the beauty of the wilderness or deserts or ocean fronts. That is a distraction for me. What haunts me and what others have commented on is whether the risks that Chris takes is worth the journey. Clearly he is torn inside and has internalized much of his family angst. He is the unexpected black sheep and at the most unusual moment, just after graduating High School he bolts from his family without ever contacting them again. Period. As others have pointed out, if he had it in mind to punish his parents because he rejected the lies that they lived life by then how to explain his (ignoring) his dear sister who loved, adored and clung to him for strength and support? Clearly Chris was above average in intelligence but it seems to me that he was unwilling to leave his adolescent and somewhat romantic boyhood behind and enter manhood with a full and vigorous grappling. Instead he runs away to find something in himself. Why is he drawn to Alaska of all places? What is, after all, Alaska: the most remote continental State, farthest he can remove himself from his parents, the most totally wild and untamed place and what he discovers only at the end, also one that can be the most dangerous place to 'go it alone' in.We do not get a sense that Chris understands what drives him, what his obsessions for obliterating his past are. He cannot live with his real name, he adopts a false persona. How odd. He cannot face his parents or his sister and include them in his withdrawal. To me that smacked of selfish and childish thoughtlessness. But, just as clearly he is drawn inwards to find a truth that he can live with. At the very end he finds it but by then the cold, impersonal, heartlessness of 'nature' has closed off more than his escape. He is doomed to die with his insight. Knowing at the very end that just being happy by himself is not enough and that this happiness, this peace with ones self has to be shared in order for it to have meaning took him so very long to learn; what is so sad is that he paid no attention to that lesson all those long months he ran from his family. He kept getting the same lesson presented to him over and over again. Those he kept company with acted with the intention of sharing and loving each other. All he had to do was slow down just enough to appreciate what they were mirroring and showing him. Had he done that he could have achieved that satori much earlier and not foolishly placed himself in such a ridiculous hazard so as to fall so deeply. His naive and displaced trust into the beauty of nature, of the goodness in nature, did not protect him from his own folly.I should read the book I suppose. The film is quite sad when you see how unnecessary the risk taking, how obvious the insights were. But, some of us are inflamed with such a burning need to run, to flee what is painful, to judge others as having failed us. Had he returned with those insights...that is what we are left wondering at the end.Powerful performances are what we expect and in Chris, Rainey, Jan and Ron we have solid characters that hold the film together. It is a moving and powerful film but ultimately so sad.",8,0,1,6 December 2008
The Graduate," Ah yes, the 60's......
","This is one of the most talked about movies from the 60's. This is the era that took America back into a war most did not want - Vietnam and it ended up tearing the nation apart. This is a movie that is only partially a mirror to the entire 60's or to the growing menace in their Vietnamese conflict. It is also a movie about a young 20 something man who is not given enough time to sort out what his next move past college will be or is given enough time to sort out his sexuality.If we pay close attention to the script we are told several key things about Benjamin. He is very bright, a very high level achiever at school, the pride and joy of his parents, apparently their only child (unless I missed something here?), someone who at an earlier age only had nasty fights with Elaine, is maybe a virgin, is definitely a schlemiel and mommas boy and is completely emotionally at odds with himself about what to do next. When we are introduced to Ben he wants to hide in his room rather than face his parents friends and their well intentioned but annoying and cloying back slaps, boozy lipstick smearing kisses and unending free advice. He keeps saying (although no one is really listening or interested in his answer) that he has no idea what he is going to do next and he keeps insisting that this is really bothering him. The pressure Ben felt was the same for all college grads; the expectation of his family to make something of himself after they had presumably paid a great deal of money for his education put him in the hot seat. Although he was home for a summer vacation, neither he or his family will let him take stock of himself and just get to a decision on his own terms. The angst he expresses seems to me to be larger than just himself. This appear to be Mike Nichols reflecting the angst of the entire 60's generation who was as I was saying just coming to grips with a huge conflict over Vietnam, a conflict that brought great friction between young people and a generation that saw America triumphant in World War 2. Although the film is a comedy, it certainly has elements of the 60's conflicts that have been written about extensively by historians and journalists alike.The film is famous in our eyes for several reasons. The music of Simon and Garfunkel is always a joy and although some of the tracks are played just wee bit too often, we enjoy the music nonetheless. The hilarious sound bites: 'Ben, I have one word for you: plastics' must have been repeated ad nauseum by people for years after. I know my brother and I used to crack ourselves up with repetitions of some of those phrases. The steamy sex scenes: my God, if Anne Bancroft is not one super hot woman in this film! I was quite surprised to see a stripper flip her breasts around in that funny and sad scene - only wearing pasties. I say surprised because I thought it a bit more steamy than films of that rating would have had at that time. It is a short scene but it effectively launches the building of a real relationship between Ben and Elaine.Much has been written analyzing the relationship between the nebisch Ben and the hyper-manipulative alcoholic and sexually deprived vixen Mrs. Robinson. Clearly she saw him come back from college and could not live without instant satisfaction. She was not interested in what he felt; she is incapable of giving that much concern to another person. She is needy, grasping, willing to hurt her own daughter in order to satisfy her pulsating libido. She has no morals and clearly wants like a true addict: getting only means more wanting. Is she a nymphomaniac then? Perhaps, but her personality is corrupted and she is more than willing to take every advantage with a young buck who has strayed into her sights. You can just imagine that all the time Ben was away from her Mrs. Robinson drank herself into oblivion with her sexless marriage. Along comes Ben and she sees salvation through physical conquest; Ben is so over his head in confusion and insecurity that although he notices that he is being used he doesn't know what to do about it. Bancroft's portrayal of Mrs. Robinson is certainly one of the most powerful and much talked about female vixens in movie history. Bancroft was a superb actress and she makes mincemeat with the stumbling Hoffman. It is just a delight to watch her even though she gives in to such self destructive urges.Hoffman: what a bang for the start of a movie career. He is so fantastic to watch there are not enough words in a short review to say why. A 'graduate' of the method school, he shows everyone why he is to be respected; as a very young actor he worked with the script and direction and the inherent conflicts of the movie without going astray or overacting. Hoffman is just worth his weight in Oscar gold.This is a seminal 60's movie and there is so much that one can see in it given my 2006 perspectives. Anyone who wants to see movie making from the 60's at it's very best should start here. There are few better than this one.",9,4,6,8 November 2006
Avatar," Breatkthrough technologies make this the new sci-fi standard
","When Kubrick's '2001: A space Odyssey' came out in 1968 critics hailed it as a milestone, a trailblazing incarnation of cinematic entertainment not seen before. Kubrick and Cameron are both great technical innovators who created new ways of making movie images, often stretching the technical limits of their own era and pointing a clear direction for future film makers for years to come. While Kubrick did not have access to the modern and incredibly powerful world of computer animation, he made up for it by creative tricks with cameras and stages that bamboozled the eyes. Cameron has all of that and then more. He has created a luxurious wonderland of images in 3 dimensions (of course they work best when you watch it at the cinema in 3D) and from the very first images you are drawn immediately into the drama with no let up till the end.About a half hour into the film I began to take notice of the historical and film influences as they surface in the story. Right away I was of the opinion that the Pocahontas/Captain Smith story was the strongest source. That was funny for me because the great Wes Studi who was in Malick's 'The New World' is back again (very under-utilized) as a 'native' Na'avi in this film. Another influence and one that caught me by surprise was the 1997 Paul Verhoeven film 'Starship Troopers'.It is clear that clichés appear off and on but this is the realm of myth making in Hollywood and it always works for the audience because semi consciously we are attracted to heroes of myth, be they sports or warrior stars or pop stars. We like the feeling of being in league with large groups of other like minded folks who are all into some love affair with someone.Technically this film has set new standards. We get full value for the extra payment to see the 3D version. Thankfully it was not ear popping loud, as I detest films that are overly noisy. The story line, which is science fiction mixed with a loathing of large mining companies by indigenous groups mixed in with tree hugging geeky science nerds (with hat tips to Spielberg in several of his films) is fun, predictable and emotionally stirring enough to keep us alert for nearly 3 hours. The actors all gave 100% with extra kudos to the mean-assed Stephen Lang (who I loved as General Pickett in 'Gettysburg')who gives a richly textured characterization of a villainous soldier who gladly was the willing executioner of the corporate vision. The idea that nothing much worse than a poor last quarter (of profits)is lifted right out of the current hatred of Wall Street (both the real one and the film).I can see why people fall in love with this film and see it many times. There is so much going on and you maybe didn't catch a line here or there the first time. It is worth owning when available. Not the greatest film of the last 10 years but well worth all the investments that Cameron and his crew have laboured at. Terrific entertainment value. A new milestone in cinematic creativity.",8,0,2,28 February 2010
Titanic," Monumental drama
","Mea Culpa: I had not watched the film till this week. But, I finally sat down and watched it over two nights. I know that Titanic aficionado's will be picking the movie apart for any mistakes and for me that's not important. I don't care enough about the ship and it's history to worry about such matters. I just enjoyed the drama for what it was, even if it was weaving quite a bit of the story out of thin air.The visual impact of the film is very powerful, with the sets giving the viewer the believable impact of watching the real thing, the original ship. The special effects were as good as I've ever seen. Again, the way the ship moved, looked like, flooded, broke apart, all those things looked very real to my eyes.The dramatic love affair is of course the hook that grabs you and it is hard not to be carried away into the sadness without your heart feeling like it has been hurt. It is a very sad story, even if it is made up (I don't know and don't care if it is). There is enough tragedy in the real story of so many people freezing to death in the frigid North Atlantic or drowning for one to feel sad. Just as a drama, I found it very entertaining and emotionally effective. Kate Winslett is gorgeous, sexy and wonderful to watch. I have noticed in almost all the films I've seen with her....that she fills up the screen with a great deal of light. Not only is she beautiful, she exudes youth and energy and in this film she is a delight to behold. Leonardo Di Caprio is wonderful and I have yet to see him in a film that I wasn't captivated. He is, like Johnny Depp, a delight to watch. This is a film with a large cast, especially the many stunt actors, who must have really suffered a lot of hours in cold water. It's a larger than life story and the film delivers. Well worth the 11 Oscars. Excellent and I'm really glad to have finally seen it. A keepsake. This is what blockbusters are supposed to be like.",10,4,8,23 March 2007
War of the Worlds," Great entertainment
","I've heard a lot of griping about this movie and I think people are just taking this medium, a movie, way too seriously. It is probably not a word for word remake of the 1898 novel by H.G. Wells. It has been reset without aliens from Mars. Fine. People have picked apart the way the plot moves along, finding flaws everywhere; for example, parts of major cities have little damage, other parts look like Hiroshima. I think we've taken this just a bit too far; this is not an English 201 course, where we dissect Spielberg's adaptation of the Wells novel, looking for strengths and weaknesses. This is nothing more than visceral entertainment, end of story.This is my first viewing of the film and I found myself totally engrossed from beginning to end, with my nerves all tied up in knots. That the film ends abruptly is nothing new to movies and there will always be those who had mentally calculated a 'better' way to end it. I think we'd be better off just looking at the story as it is. It is science fiction, not a glimpse of a possible reality, anymore than 'Independance Day' was (and that is one of the silliest Sci Fi films I've ever seen). I think that our comments should be much more on how the action moves along rather than the gaps in reality. As soon as we catch ourselves measuring what is real or how things don't make sense I think we've lost the film and we should walk away. This being said, I didn't feel that there were so many obvious gaps in script continuity that made me laugh or scowl. It's a super fast paced adventure of survival with no certain outcome and that's about all we need to factor in. The way it unravels is irrelevant because it is not supposed to be within the realm of the possible everyday world.Cruise, as usual, delivers an outstanding performance. His ridiculous commitment's to Scientology aside, he's a terrific actor and I've yet to see him fall on his face with a role. Dakota does scream quite a bit and act hysterical in the film. Don't blame her: Spielberg pulls all the strings and that is the way he formatted her character. On the other hand, did we expect a little girl of her age to be unmoved by monstrous aliens torching the world? I mean really, give the kid some slack. I'm sorry: I love her. And Tim Robbins' character is slimy, off-centered and just delicious in adding more creepiness and tension.The special effects were totally outstanding. Look, if you're going to use CGI, you want the effects to look realistic and Spielberg knows how to deliver. You spend the big bucks and ILM and their computer droids deliver. The music was John Williams at his best. All in all, come on people: lighten up. It's fun, fast, furious, violent (heh, what year are we living in?) and fluff. Enjoy it for what it is.",9,1,5,25 June 2007
There Will Be Blood," Outstanding, creepy exposition of the darkest ambitions to power
","There are a number of very good and perceptive reviews of this film. Just a few comments from me then. I have seen Daniel Day-Lewis in only two films, much to my chagrin (now). The Last of the Mohicans was the first and now TWBB. In this film Lewis displays his refined method actors chops and for me it was a frightening embodiment of a really creepy man whose lust for power and wealth ran amok, twisting and subverting his sensibilities much like I imagine a drug addicts mind succumbs to the chemical demons flowing in his veins.The era of the great oil men at the outset of the oil industry is well covered in novels and movies and this is a very fitting depiction of one of the most Dickensian avenues of American history. When we see pursuit of ambition it is riven with hellish violence that lingers in the memory long after the curtain rises. While I have not read the Upton Sinclair novel 'Oil', I think that the film stands on its own. Its despair goes a fair stretch deeper than Steinbeck's 'Grapes of Wrath' or 'East of Eden'. Funny that I think about it, but the pain in this film much reminds me of the same found in a book I am half way through now, 'The March', written about General W. T. Sherman's blood soaked march of death and destruction through the deep south in the middle of the US Civil War.Several themes stand out. The young child that Plainview raises as his own is shown a degree of respect and tenderness until that fateful day when he is nearly killed by a well head explosion. Now suddenly a distraction to the endless hunt for more oil, he is cast aside in a heartless manner; something that will come back to haunt Plainview throughout the story. Second is the powerful tension of contrasts set up between Plainview and Eli Sunday. The mutual loathing and hate these men had for each other grows like a sickly moss until it overcomes them both.The surface layer themes are all moral and should remind us of the era, still with us, of Bernie Maddoff and 'Gordon Gecko'. Should we cringe when we watch this type of drama? I should say so. Does it not well describe our current ultra consumerist mentality? While we are not all directly involved in the dark deeds, do we not indirectly contribute to questionable acts of environmental degradation and support of highly suspect third world labour pools, all for our own creature comforts? Should we not think on this when we do all the cringing? I don't know where Day-Lewis found that voice of Plainview but it seemingly embodies a man possessed of urges that would make us hide the children and have us slam the door shut. His hypnotic self assured expression of will makes his descent into madness even more unsettling. He richly deserved the Oscar. An excellent and powerful film. (I found the soundtrack very nerve wracking. It felt like someone was running their fingernails down the chalk board, many times over....all to spine tingling effect. The visual special effects were wonderful to watch...)",9,2,3,26 May 2010
To Kill a Mockingbird," A masterpiece that resonates as strongly today as ever
","Perhaps somewhere in the very far future when African Americans and Caucasian Americans have finally learned to see each other as brothers and sisters and not a human of color, then looking back on this film will seem strange and wistful. Until that time, we can do no better than to sit down and read the book and then watch this perfect movie adaptation.There are other great books and movies that cover the depression years in America. 'Grapes of Wrath' comes to mind. Harper Lee's book and this film focus not on the displaced as much as how one person can rise to the occasion, show a strong moral spine and true courage. It would have been too simple to say that the film was about prejudice. Coming to the screen as it did during the rising cauldron of the Civil Rights movement, this film was a perfect mirror for the haunting specter that refused to shed its shadow over the south. In the aftermath of the ruinous Civil War, southern states, especially the Carolina's which led the revolt, suffered very badly during and after the war. In some places poverty and destitution never left the land. What did people do to get by in the depression era? Did they fall back on old ways and use scapegoats to satisfy the blame game? Certainly and that is where the story here begins.The audience watching this film in 1962 was familiar with prejudice but rarely had it seen a white man treat an African American with respect and a resolute commitment to seeking justice. There are other sinister themes that rise to the surface. The implication of a daughter being beaten by a drunken father, the taboo of a white woman seducing a black man, the injustice done to a mentally handicapped man by shuttering him like a prisoner in his own home; these are all hot buttons that would have made an audience squirm and disquiet their comfort zones. Even more ugly was the false accusation of an honest man, a person that was expected to be found guilty even by his own peers simply because he was a visible minority; this was the deep south and prejudice was so widespread. The richness of the story gives depth and detail to the lives of Atticus Finch and his fiercely independent children as they explore their lives. With several subplots swirling around the main trial, the audience is given constant stimulation in vivid colors of human drama. Shot in black and white and blessed with a superb script, one of the greatest male actors in the English speaking world, a sublime musical score by Elmer Bernstein, two child actors who were so natural that they became Atticus's children in a real way.....this film is iconic in American cinema and for so many good reasons. Perhaps Gregory Peck's greatest role, this film is unforgettable and has taken on a tinge of greatness that is entirely worthy of its craft. If you must own one Peck film, this is the one. As the saying goes, they simply don't make them like this anymore; what a pity.",10,0,1,26 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," blockbuster end to the series
","Saw it last night. First of all it is by far the most outstanding and cutting edge sci-fi digital film to date. The visual effects are so enjoyable that the megabucks Lucas must have spent to produce it was well spent. Just stay long enough to watch the credits roll at the end of the film and try and count how many animators he used! Wow. The acting is good, not great. The draw is the visual drama, the fact that we know the plot and where it's going. By the end of the film your heart is a lump in your throat as the curtain comes down. There are a few things that linger in my mind. At the end Yoda mentions something very odd about how he needs Obi-wan to go into training while he stays for years in deep cover. What training? To learn how to contact his lately lamented Jedi Master trainer. That's the way I understood it and I'll certainly be seeing the movie again to make sure I heard correctly. Talking to dead teachers is something that Lucas covered in the first few films but no one made much of a fuss about it. When I heard it this time I was really surprised. The implications.....remind me of the now famous line '...I see dead people' and you can figure out the rest of the spooky factor. Another thing I am mystified at is what Padme mumbles just as she is dying. I could not for the life of me hear what she was saying....something about the Sith perhaps.All in all the film is a wonderful drama which at the very end makes you cringe in your seat as you watch Annakin destroyed and nearly killed in a scene plucked right out of Dante's 'Inferno'. There was no comedy in this hellish final fight scene and to see him suffer so much was very hard to watch. This is a film for adults only. Children should not be allowed to sit through this; totally inappropriate. The amount of murders alone is really a surprise, with Lucas finally making a real adult film.In closing I should say that Williams has written a superb score for voice, choir and orchestra. It sounds at times like a soaring symphony and is seamlessly woven into the entire movie. Great soundtrack and truly Oscar material. I intend to buy a copy of the DVD when it comes out as this is a real keeper. Well done Lucas. You gave us a mountain of superb entertainment value over these many years and you created an entirely new way of making films.",10,1,6,26 May 2005
Inception," Brilliant, insightful, substantial intellectual thriller
","Saw it last night and it was wonderfully satisfying. This morning it occurred to me that one of the films it has absorbed into the plot was a Robin Williams vehicle, 'What dreams may come'. In that film a man seeks to find his lost wife, who has descended to the depths of 'hell' all of which she directed herself there as a form of punishment. The husband seeks to go and find her, at great personal (spiritual) peril, knowing the risks, to try and convince her to come away from the dark corner (of her soul) that she has condemned herself to, all in the name of love. Sound familiar? If you have seen Inception then it has more than a solid resemblance.The other film that immediately came to mind was the Matrix (trilogy). In fact, half way through this dazzling film I had made a mental note of calling this 'Matrix 4'; although they run on different premises, the influences of the Matrix films are all over this new one. And this is a good thing as far as the overall film is concerned.This is a thought provoking film. How far removed from reality is the premise of this film? Considering how the mechanics of hypnosis works, with how a mind can be taught to think certain thoughts, all through soft suggestive words should make us consider the plausible successes that dream manipulations might entail. The sci-fi aspects of the film are of course just that, not really within our (current) grasp. That does not mean that it is impossible to be developed or is within striking distance now. I have read stories of how mind washing techniques are supposed to work and one could do well by reading up on the Manchurian Candidate types of techniques. The problem with this type of material is that so much of it (in print) careens off into super conspiratorial side roads and before you know it, you've lost the original premises. Suffice it to say that mind manipulations exist today, the most commonly used ones (that will reach the unconscious or preconscious mind) are hypnosis. Also remember that hypnosis can be self applied with behaviour modification as the objective. People who seek to loose weight or stop smoking have used mind altering techniques for years.What is fascinating about this film is the idea that not only can we reach into a persons first layer unconscious mind but that doors can be opened at that level to reach even further down into deeper layers of the mind. What this implies, for me, is the dual aspects of our minds capacity. Our minds, even if one argues existentially, have the innate and potential capacity for an (almost) limitless expansion outwards and the same is probably true for reaching the unconscious aspects of our minds total capacity. One could even argue that the overall total capacity our minds ALL sits in the unmanifested and always hidden unconscious state, just waiting for direction. Some would reverse the direction and say that all of our conscious mind is entirely directed by the unconscious, which again is always hidden from our conscious consideration. In this myriad of considerations this film gives us adequate reasons to pause and consider our own capacities.This film, like all modern action films, has wonderful special effects, many of which will have you saying out loud 'matrix' inspired. They are delightful to watch. The actors all play off the nervous and edgy vibes of the action. The plot is confusing and circuitous but the writer is smart enough to throw in just a small handful of very funny bits to ease us through the long periods of tense moments. This is really a film to watch several more times, with so much going on and quite a bit of dialogue spoken one needs several viewings in order to digest the meaning. Highly recommended and certainly a career highlight for the always powerful Mr. Di Caprio. This will be high on my must own list.",10,2,7,4 August 2010
Mr. Holland's Opus," Weaving love and music into the fabric of life
","Although this is not entirely Richard Dreyfuss's film, surrounded as he is by an excellent cast, he holds the film entirely on his shoulders. He has made many films over the years and has hit some memorable home runs. Think of Close Encounters, Jaws and you've got between the two films some very big hits which delivered terrific entertainment fun. I've enjoyed his work over the years and even his lesser known works such as 'Tin Men' are quite enjoyable and have worn well over the years.In 'Mr. Holland's Opus', Dreyfuss is given lots of depth to his character and he wasted no time filling in the form. The subject and script must have excited him because his performance is strong, centered, not overblown or over sentimentalized, touching, emotional when necessary and reserved when called for. There is an especially magical moment when he is in a close up with the student who excelled at singing (can't recall her name). They have an obvious sexual undercurrent going and we are led to believe, breath by breath that they will embrace and yet Dreyfuss takes his body language just to the furthest edge and then holds. The tension collapses when someone walks in the room and we are amazed that they did not kiss. It's a really great scene that aspiring actors should study; here is a pro who shows how to act with finesse.The story is terrific and the plot carefully includes many characters and although some verge on stereotypes, they all appear quite believable and human and much of this has to do with the quality of the actors and the lines they emote. There is a strong impulse to drive this film into a 'heart on your sleeves' climax and it does stray briefly into this mode. However, by the time the film is over the build up of love for this man is so immense and overpowering that the surprise he gets at the very end just makes us all weep with joy.I especially enjoyed how his character finally learned about his own failures as a father and rather than sink into depression and recrimination, he rose to that challenge in the same insightful way his entire teaching career was handled.The film is a complete joy from beginning to end; the cast as I say was superb. Given a terrific story and sensitive direction from Stephen Herek, this is as good as film entertainment ever gets. Keep the tissue box close at hand; it's a tearful joy and not easily forgotten.",10,4,5,7 June 2007
Munich," Flawed as history, but still powerful entertainment
","This is my second full viewing of this film, this one at home. Just a few days ago I watched 'Syriana' again and I've had time to let the two contrasting films move about in my memory. After watched Munich I downloaded a bunch of comments that author George Jonas contributed earlier this year, relating to his involvement (largely non-involvement) in the development of the film. Much has been said about how unhappy he was at how his book was somewhat refurbished into a polished Spielberg vehicle, almost unrecognizable to him. He also said that the film as a film was very good, even if not the idea he had in mind if his book was to one day become a film. I must say that I have yet to see another film version of his book, 'The Sword of Gideon', although I hear it is also a must see.'Munich' has stuck Jew and non-Jew in a deep and sensitive place, causing much gnashing of teeth and strongly worded condemnations as well as praise. I don't recall this level of negativity or recrimination when 'Schindler's List' came out. Among my fellow Jews it sounded much more like the fulminations and frothing that came with the release of 'The Last Temptation of Christ'.The film should make us ask questions and I'm not sure that the debate has become any more clear. Certainly Spielberg (maybe not Jonas) has forced us to consider the following: in the face of outright terrorist murders, is a state well recommended to seek total revenge, tit for tat, an eye for an eye? Even more: has this mentality brought about any increase of good, any lowering of tensions, any more common grounds between the combatants? What, he asks, has been the net result of many years of reprisals? These questions alone were enough to make many Jews totally outraged at Spielberg. How, they thought, did he have the gall to even question the motives? To make the Mossad agents have a conscience, even though not completely the same one or shared, made them look weak, at least in the eyes of those who thought and still do believe that revenge in such cases is totally appropriate. Never mind, the other side will argue, how in the long run it has proved to be counter-productive; with each form of terrorist group that is attacked, the next incarnation is double the level of terror and murder. So, what can be done to evacuate everyone from this dark hole that vacuums in the best of intentions of all people? What else can be done when such outrageous terror is committed? I'm not sure that Spielberg has an answer. I don't think that he intended to sit on a soapbox and argue that Israel was wrong at the time of the Munich murders to seek revenge. Given the environment of Israel and the surrounding countries, doing nothing, acting like passive Buddhist monks is not what Spielberg had in mind. However, he is also saying that more of the same is also not working.So, what are we left with? Never mind that he humanizes many of the terrorists. When we are engulfed in self righteous indignation, it is easy to emotionally profit by making the 'other' a monster and twisting them into non-human entities, making them dehumanized to the ultimate extent. That only blinds the hateful into being drawn into the same dance as the perpetrators. After so many years, Spielberg has the gall to say, who now is the perpetrator and who the victim? It's all been blurred into a wasteful bloody noise and it just gets worse all the time.In closing for now, let us remember please that this is a film, not a documentary. We need to be reminded of this from time to time because we tend to get carried away with our emotional attachments to the side we feel is most correct, righteous. With God on our side we can do no wrong and we can feel as justified in the destruction of our enemies. However, we also have to remember that seen from a birds eye view, everyone involved is thinking the same thoughts. That's only one reason that this deadly dance goes on and on. There are many reasons. The film only points our attention at some but not all of the issues. It's a powerful drama, 'borrowed' from Jonas's book. It is not the first or the last word on the subject. But, it's worth watching because it will shake you just where you need to be stirred.",9,3,4,31 December 2006
Born on the Fourth of July," 'Who's gonna love me now.....?'
","I waited until August 2007 to see this film and I'm sorry I waited so long. Stone's films usually are so strong that when they enter the mass market the ripples are large, his messages often creating feverish backlash. Few are left on the fence and like Michael Moore's films, they are polarizing, entertaining, often jarring and disturbing. Stone is a man who was in Viet Nam and saw it all up close. As such he was well suited to comment on the war and comment he did over several excellent films. Ron Kovic's story was an appropriate addition to Stone's collection of 'Nam films, coming as it did only three years after his seminal 'Platoon'.There have been many Vietnam war films made and this film is certainly one of the most moving I've seen. It is always tempting to get drawn into clichés about war, using stereotypes as a replacement for depth in writing and insight. Stone is a fine writer and director. Along with Kovic's own words and experience, this film manages to honor the appropriate focus, which is Kovic's journey into a drama that began as a patriotic desire to do the right thing. What is remarkable about Kovic's journey is how much he matures in such a short time and how he managed to change his mind about a war that he volunteered to enter. Like so many of his generation, he was initially convinced that Viet Nam was a far flung battle between American style freedom and lifestyles and the oppressive and expanding web of communism. That these ideas were a leftover of the anxieties and illusions of the Cold War was not apparent at that time. In fact one could honestly say that America had not really admitted how lost it was in Indochina until an aged and contrite Robert McNamara recently wrote how his generation of leaders had been completely wrong about Vietnam. There has not been a more socially divisive war since Vietnam and it's hard to argue that there will be one again. Coming as it did as a huge change in society evolved, the war became the ultimate metaphor for all that was wrong with the American vision. Gone were the halcyon days of the American's as liberators, beloved in lands across the world as World War 2 ended. Now the nightly news showed atrocities with American soldiers as the perpetrators. Kovic's tour of duty shadowed all of these changes. His treatment by an underfunded and somewhat indifferent veterans hospital only added to the process of disillusionment and bitterness that was to lead him to completely transform his attitudes towards the war. That he was abused, spat at and beaten by those who would not listen to his anti-war words finalized and crystallized his transformation from soldier to anti-war activist. All of this came at a huge cost to himself.Whoever said Tom Cruise was not a great actor should see this film. Consider that he was all of 27 years old when the film was released and watch how brave his performance was. His ability to travel from starry eyed child of the 50's, his head full of the previous generations glory at bringing liberation to millions, his belief that communists were the evil empire, all the way through purgatory into realizing that there was no truth to this vision. Cruise gives a stupendous and raw performance, holding back nothing, tearing open his emotions to reveal the depth of Kovic's spiral into total despair.Ah, then there is Willem Dafoe. His character, so completely destroyed by the ravages of what he had done as a soldier, so aflame in self loathing and grief, he can no longer even recognize that 'Kovic' is a mirror image. The scene of them spitting on each other, wrestling each other out of their wheelchairs is so tragically upsetting that one wants to avert the eyes to see such pain.This is a film to watch several more times. If there are finer essays on the loss of dreams, the transformation of America into a frightening military powerhouse, equally as intimidating and dangerous as they themselves feared the Russians were, than I do not know of it. There is much in this film to consider and given our current state of yet another American disaster (Iraq and Afghanistan), a film that has not aged one drop. A triumph for Stone, Kovic, Cruise and Defoe.",10,2,4,10 August 2007
Beetlejuice," Hilarious
","Oh man, this film is just too much fun. If you need to laugh to release some tension then films like this just seep into the funny bone and you're away. The premise (of the newly dead) is quite an interesting concept. If you look at films like 'Ghost' or 'What dreams may come' they both refer to the same issues. Think of 'The Sixth Sense' and again you have a director grappling with dead people. 'Beetle Juice' could have made this into a creepy-scary film but the feeling here is all in good fun, while lampooning the yuppy generation at the same time. This is satire written large and we never feel upset at any time. The big winner in this film is Keaton who in my view just steals every scene he's in with an over-the-top bravura performance of an exorcist from the dark side. I watched his first major film the other day 'Night Shift' and in both films he easily inhabits a totally manic but hilarious energy. His comic timing is spot on and he can run on high voltage for extended lengths. Although he is also an excellent serious actor (see: Clean and Sober') he is perhaps best known for his funny roles and nothing beats his performance here.Alec Baldwin, boy did he look young here (because he was) and about 50 pounds lighter. Geena Davis is her usual simple and hilarious self. Catherine O'Hara is incredible and all her years at Second City show through. The highlight of the film that everyone talks about is the Calypso scene; this is one of the funniest moments you'll ever see.This is light hearted fair and the laughter is well earned; this film has aged well and is well worth the view. Terrific.",9,1,3,15 March 2007
