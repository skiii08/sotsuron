Requiem for a Dream," 4D adventure to the purgatory for addicts
","I literally felt pains on my arm which has multiple needle orifice after I watched this movie. This expanding suppurating wound and close ups depicting Leto shooting his last crack into his vein on the exact central spot of his fresh bloody cut is gutwrentching, cruelly genuine and like a slam in my face. The edifying prowess and earthshaking influence of merely a screen grab is a million times stronger than horrifying image on a cigarette packs. The camera went unflinchingly to the bare ugly fact to addiction when a tightly cut sequence of the depraved prognostics enduring their punishment(*ss to ass underground sex show and electric therapy and amputation surgeon )with contrast to the fleetingness of the pleasure it brings us(the fast-paced and highly simplified shots implies the swiftness of consumption of drugs) and their greater hope for the future, whether realizable or not. The daring visual way is so well suited in this particular movie that any other movie's possible usage will appear to be a pretentious failure to me. This film is the kind of film that you are not willing to go through again, not because of its quality, but the uneasiness it gives you is so cumbersome and memorable that it's like you yourself's personal travelogue to the grave.",8,0,1,18 April 2014
American History X," Its amusing how one-dimensional this film is.
","So Edward Norton is supposed to be a chameleon kind of actor, abode in the upper echelon of thespian professionalism with a distinctive character and absolutely a cut above the rest of the Hollywood illiterates. I've heard of this movie for so long but never intrigued by the signal-blazing poster and preaching-sound plot. But then I watched it by default and become so angry that compelled myself to rant out my rage. Its rub*ish, don't sully your eyes by it.Honestly, every character is black and white. Long overdue prodigal son who used to be a loving a caring straight A student got lectured by his racist old man and SUDDENLY abandon all his DOUBLE PHD black teacher's words and starting to mutter extreme racist remarks on news report when his 'honest hardworking' firefighter dad got shot and killed. Then unsurprisingly he was claimed to be brainwashed and apparently become the rabbis of his secret guild. And his uncontrollable ANGER(so symbolic and repetitively accentuated in the movie that you started doubting if the director thinks the audience are all eight year old) moved to his family, to defend his belief and stand out for his horrendous looking lady friend. he even stuffed a chunk of beef into his sister's mouth to shut her up. AND he killed the guys who tried to sneaked his car through the most thrilling way(I didn't know if you put mouth on curbs and kick it could kill a man). I'm flabbergasted how the storyline goes exactly as I predicted(I learned in primary school if you want to salute a kind of concept you first suppressed it and then through a heavenly epiphany you realized the folly of you and the mightiness of the concept, say the virtue of be punctual), I thought maybe deviated a little from the standard via but sadly, sadly it doesn't. the linchpin of the movie got his second life and love education behind bars by his fellow linen worker and a f*ck in the a*s.Every character is either purely good or evil, all deprived of sanity and love and proper education. The fat bug killer is a racist for a reason, he simply is insolent and grumpy as hell about his life, he eats jelly beans with a bow; the mason-vision gangster are dramatized and demonized to present the very extremity of racism, which itself desensitize the audience and shift the concept of racism to terrorism. Apparently the director itself is undereducated but ridiculously bold to produce a film regarding racism without do much research about the itself. You'd startled by the level of superficiality and phoniness of the film. They even spent 3 mins on a black versus white basketball game.yeah.",2,6,13,1 April 2014
The Deer Hunter," i love you bay-bie!
","Without conflating the movie itself to a higher cause of anti violence and caustic tirade of American's reckless and disproportionate decision of Vietnam war, I think deer hunter is The most well-made war movie I've ever seen, for its sheer richness of emotional depiction of each character in the movie, which further correlated to the audience and induce psycal analysis which transcends the movie in every possible way. One thing about war genre is that director can be obsessed with the infeasible idea of depicting the cruelty of as many people as possible, but deer hunter has no such ambition, it simply tells us a story between three blue-collar workers' life, totally changed by the harrowing war. But the pain is self explanatory, it is simply out there that we automatically internalize it without the necessity of the movie itself conflating it to the dark nature of humanity and warfare.Normally, what kind of director have the guts to hold the camera steadily to a wedding for so long unabashedly, to meticulously and objectively observe every particulars and trivia happened there, thus allow the audience themselves to see each character's mindset and personality, each sparks and subtle fermentation between those young people, each encounters reflective of their unpreparedness of life and more solemnly and impending, the war, each purposeless and dare-devil machismo's ludicrousness, which only serve to contrast the utter atrocity and macabre of the war and even make the former seem juvenile and pediatric. The movie moves slowly as if it has all the time in the world, and it is about to show us the deeper reality between figures, we see Michale has this huge impulse to kiss Linda but his restrained it, this two-second moments has more romantic tension than all your contemporary New York City love stories can ever get in sum, and its not a punch in the stomach, we always sorta of getting it, Meryl's role in this dabble and cul-de-sac town is a marvel to everyone, she's vulnerable and delicate, has a drunkard abusive father yet she can maintain her breathtaking grace and have fun with her friends, she is meant to be something that has the chemical so powerful to change the route of the movie. We also see a grim-faced veteran sitting taciturnly at the bar, refusing to engage in the tumultuous and cheerful background, and the drunk crowd's amazing numbness show their unpreparedness an ignorance of the war, they have zero knowledge of what could be after them, possibly because of their youth and stupidity, but more likely because of their subconscious refusal to think about what is awaiting their far away from home, that's why when they are so heavily drunk and running naked on the street, they promised each other of never letting each other alone in the war,its a bit of martyred romanticism and adolescent promise, but its still effectively spellbinding immediately and Michale did realize its promise. And I really just enjoy the way they sang together in a bar playing snooker, ChristopheR Walken has such a style, as alway.The whole movie's opening is linear, chronically developed with steady pace without letting one single shot being wasted or redundant, shows us each person's traits and prebolds their destiny. The crowd's bantering and even verbal altercation on their deer hunting shoot ed in such a joyous way, that I simply give up my compulsory psychoanalysis and just enjoy their dialog, this part could have worked as a audio-book. It's natural, plain and very characteristic, with the composing foggy sceneries of the valley, the happiness ofcommaraderies between the crowd is escalated to a ecclesiastic level, more like a ritual for them to re communicate and re unionize. Michale's stubbornness and his swerving principle has always accompanied him, (if he refused to lend a pair of boots, he wont do it), and that's probably another reason why Michale turned into a resolute and granite soldier with an uncompromising and courageous spine, though going through the same ordeal as nick and Stevie, he's the only one who still has the strength to try, try to assimilate himself into the old small town lifestyle, still has the power to purge the harrowing and slit-throat memories out of his brain while nick and Stevie had succumbed themselves to the inflictions and haunted fears, one physically and one mentally. Of course the most carving image of deer hunter is the notorious Russian roulette, probably the most nerve cracking moments on big screen with exactitude and genuine that I can barely watch through, which is the award-winning moments for Christopher walken as he gradually has a nerve breakdown under the audience's eyes. But the when the war ended, this sort of gambling is continued, thus I'm not sure if the director is predominantly inclined to flagellate the inhumanities of war, but how the war can bring changes to innocent individuals, with the side dish of the classic gravitas of war. Seriously I don't particularly see deer hunter as a war movie, but a movie consistently and continuously spanned around three friends' lives, from one of them's wedding to another's funeral, war is just one of the many important event that happened in their lives, the accentuation is surely not the war, it's the influence it has upon normal small-town human being, the antiwar sensation is something we can possibly deduce from the particulars of the movie, it never is the central topic, and it's the way I love to depict the war.",10,1,4,27 April 2014
