Captain Marvel," The worst so far
","So the question i keep asking myself is 'why do i keep thinking these movies will get any better?' Who knows, maybe because i enjoyed Deadpool and Wonder Woman so much i thought that maybe this superhero movie might not be the technicolour spray of vomit that many of the previous ones have been, but boy was i wrong! this has to be the worst one so far. The main character is just flat and dull and in no way behaves like a hero you want to root for.(possibly just down to bad writing and bad acting) The plot is just poor the writing is BAD and some of the 'special effects' are just terrible. I left wondering what on earth i had just watched. it's just instantly forgettable and a reminder to me that this is the last time i waste my time or money.",2,10,18,8 March 2019
