Airlift," looks like In and out Akshaykumar film
","Story line and theme was based on some realistic base. Even though music was not that much but OK OK. And the action is again superb from the king of Bolly wood. Excellent taking and few shots are really impressive. looks like Director has complete belief in Akshay to uplift the movie Airlift.And he got the Good Result. Nimrat Kaur is good in her Role and gave her best. Actor Kumud Mishra did well. achieved the right mix of impressive aerial shots and cramped hand-held bits, and reasonably well-textured with credible Middle Eastern detailing. The director's decision to dodge grandstanding benefits the film as a whole, making it completely believable and convincing as a human drama. Finally we can say Airlift is a must watch film for all the Indians with a strong story line and Action to the peaks.",10,7,11,22 January 2016
