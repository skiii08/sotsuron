The Avengers," The Best Super Hero Movie Ever
","This movie is an epic adventure for everyone. If you've been waiting for a bunch of super heroes in one movie your dream has come true. I was really impressed with the action in this movie, i was also impressed with the background music as well. The story to this movie was the way it should be and making Loki the villain in this movie was the perfect choice. This has got to be one of the best action movies in history. It was also pretty hilarious watching all the reactions the hulk made to all the characters,especially when he grabbed Loki and tossed him like a rag doll.I think iron man was the most exciting thing about this movie. If you watch the extra ending of the movie you will find out that Thanos might appear in the avengers 2 that is coming out in 2015. It will also have you looking forward to the guardians of the galaxy movie coming out in 2014. Overall its an awesome movie.",8,2,5,23 June 2013
Iron Man 3," Most Exciting Iron Man Movie
",The movie was great in all but the story caught me by surprise. I loved the action and the special effects but it got me kind of confused about the mandarin villain and seeing Tony Stark blow up all his suits at the end. It was different from the other iron man movies and that was what i liked about it. I was amazed how they tried to relate the avengers to the movie and telling you all that Tony's been through. The iron patriot was a perfect idea to put in this film and seeing Tony with a new iron man suit. It felt pretty intense at some parts of the film and i think that's what made all the difference because the last two films didn't feel as seriously intense as this film. It makes you think at the end Tony doesn't want to be a hero anymore but something tells me he will return. That's definitely making me look forward to the Avengers 2. Overall it was a great movie and especially for Marvel fans.,8,2,4,4 July 2013
Man of Steel," Super Great
",This movie had so much action that it was so exciting to watch. This movie was a lot better then the old Superman movies to me. It was so intense and had a perfect plot. This is the way a superman movie should be made. I liked how they made krypton look and all the great special effects and graphics. I think they showed a little to much flashbacks and the only problem i had with the movie was the part when Superman healed Lois with his heat vision. It reminded me of Superman 2 on how they made the story and used the villains. This is a must see movie for all DC comic fans. Marvel fans should check this movie out too. Im looking forward to seeing Superman show up in the justice league movie.,7,2,6,4 July 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Best Action Movie of 2014
","This is definitely the best superhero movie to ever come out so far. This movie had fun characters, hilarious humor, amazing action and special effects and the perfect plot to go with the story line. It was different and had its own very unique concept. I loved the villains in the movie and iv'e really become a huge fan of rocket raccoon after seeing the movie. The movie had pretty much everything it needed including drama, suspense, humor, crime, and action in the right order. This movie is indeed a new age classic marvel superhero film and i am really excited to see how the movie follows the other marvel films. I enjoyed this movie a lot and i think it was better than the avengers.",9,6,11,7 October 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," The Best Batman Movie Ever
","This movie is so intense that you cant take your eyes of the screen. Bane was the perfect villain in this movie. Anne Hathaway was the perfect actress to play cat woman, she looks just like her. Its very exciting you'll love it. At the end i just knew batman didn't die, i had too much faith. If you watch the very end of the movie you can just tell there might be a robin movie or a night wing movie. They say this movie was suppose to be the last dark knight but i guess not since robin is rising. This movie also had intense action and intense violence. It wasn't as violent as the last one with Heath Ledger playing the joker but it was a pretty dark movie and a lot better then the old batman movies. This movie will also get you looking forward about the justice league movie coming out in 2015.",9,2,5,20 June 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," How it all Started
",Let me start by saying I'm a huge star wars fan and i always will be. Star wars is what made me start watching movies. This has got to be one of the best movies ever made in history. This film is a classic and it will be around forever. This movie has the greatest story and the best series of all time. Watching them from episodes 4-3 is the best way to understand star wars. This is one of those movies you can keep watching over and over. The special effects were successful to me even though it was oldies style. Seeing lasers bounce off the screen and watching the light saber duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader will get you very excited and especially the space ship battles. If you want to watch an awesome sci-fi movie star wars is the one. The force will be with you when you watch this movie.,10,1,2,6 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Best SyFy Movie Ever
",This is the best star wars movie ever created. This movie was perfectly filmed. This was definitely the darkest star wars film in the entire series. I loved seeing how many things happened in this movie like seeing the millennium falcon getting chased by tie fighters and showing Yoda for the first time and also seeing Luke in a light saber duel against Darth Vader and the battle of Hoth and most importantly finding out that Darth Vader is Luke's father. This movie is one the best movies ever made in the history of movies. This movie has more action than you can imagine. Even though George Lucas didn't direct this film it was still perfectly written. This will always be my favorite movie of all time.,10,0,0,6 July 2013
