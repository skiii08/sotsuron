The Benchwarmers," Benchwarmers is not a shelf warmer
","This is not a movie that deserves to be left on the shelf at your local movie store to collect dust and be passed by browsers searching for a good comedy. Why?? IT IS A GREAT COMEDY!!! I was afraid to see this movie in the theaters and deemed it not worth my $5.75 but I accidentally watched the first five minutes in Best Buy the other day and before I knew it the credits were rolling. The movie surprisingly kept me wanting to know what happened next which is rare for a Happy/Madison production. I laughed and actually cheered once, i think, for the Benchwarmers and the last five minutes took a rather bizarre twist when the momentum and gist of the movie changed but held your attention. It is a great movie and I would almost recommend it for the Friday night family movie if not for the recessive use of curse words and sexual references that pop up here and there but for 15 and up (especially guys) this is a must see. Plus, if you don't want to see this movie because you hate Napolian Dynamite, LIKE ME, forget Napolian and go see this movie. It is waiting for you to pluck it from the shelf as we speak.",4,0,0,31 July 2006
