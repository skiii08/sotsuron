Blade Runner 2049," As good or better than original
","It's a long movie with a cerebral dialogue, but I cannot stop watching. The visuals and archaic technology references provide a typical blade runner backdrop, which is intriguing. The characters are well developed, and the dystopic theme follows suit perfectly with the original movie. The philosophical questions the movie ask are very appealing to a techie world on the brink of AI and quantum technology. The movie had a poor showing in the box office, but somehow I strongly feel it will have and enduring cult following. Gaff returns dropping some Hungarian (nyugdijes - retired). The more times I watch this movie, the more I see, and catch. The soundtrack is honestly (if this is possible) better than the Vangis one in the original. I know I am a BR fanatic so some may poo-poo this review, but this movie delivers a slow but intense plot build up - and has a better, more intense climax, with an ending that leaves one asking many questions (again). A truly inspiring, if not disturbing and intense sequel that truly delivers.",9,3,11,21 August 2018
