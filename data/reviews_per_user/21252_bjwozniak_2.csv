Mission: Impossible III," this sucked
","i was looking for action and adventure, some great scenes there, but, seriously, i couldn't watch one more, 5 min, no acting cruise close-up so i had to leave, the plot was lost in Tommy's' close-up contract anyway, i didn't care about the ending-choker at best! As far as the action scenes...fast and furious...very entertaining just not enough of them...this was no James bond let me tell you, a snooze for a Tuesday afternoon flick at best. I just cant get over the fact that this contract obviously contained more screen minutes of him alone, close-up and personal with nothing to give, than any other element of the script. I mean, maybe a moist eye and a tear drop for some reason but it blew the movie right off the Grammy list I'm sure. But then again, who really knows what gets the votes in la la land.!",3,1,2,4 September 2006
The Illusionist," entertaining, stuck to subject mater, characters were consistent
","i liked the film, i stayed to the end, even stayed and glanced at the cast credits, well deserving i might add...this film had flow, interest, illusion, continuity and surprise...total entertainment...as far as the director goes...he kept it together with continual flow, no dead spots and no over-directing the cast...smooth move as they performed with character and charm...i particularly enjoyed the male performances...Rufus Sewell was a typical nasty leader who never came close to weakening, (thank the director for that), Eddie Marsan became a special character as he stepped back his time off screen led to me wondering where he was, but came back as the trusted friend after all(surprise), so this leaves Paul Giamatti with a groovy path to create, with inspector like insight and personal gains consciences while protecting the commoners from the wrath of the crown prince...the biggest surprise for me was how convincing ed was as this mysterious magician especially for a period piece...nice job!",10,1,1,3 September 2006
