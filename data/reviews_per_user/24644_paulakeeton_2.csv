Captain Phillips," Wonderful movie
","This is by far one of the best movies I have seen. Tom Hanks is incredible in this movie along with the other cast. It is full of drama and you are glued to the movie from the time it begins until the very end. I am a Tom Hanks fan. This is one of the best roles he has played and was definitely meant for Tom Hanks. This is the kind of movie that you want to watch when you spend your hard earned money on a movie. It was well written, very well directed and the whole cast and crew deserves an award. I am not at all a person that likes to see a movie the second time but this is one I would definitely see again. I am sure anyone that watches this movie will feel the same. Well worth the time and money to see.",10,0,3,6 April 2014
Gravity," Terrible Movie
","This was the worst movie I have seen, especially to have Sandra Bullock and George Clooney starring in this. It was a total waste of money and time. There should have been more to this movie, more excitement, more at the end when she landed- wherever that was...I would not waste my time and money on this movie, it isn't worth it. There should have at least been some kind of 'love connection' or something going on between those two..but, it was very boring and was not worth seeing. It should have at least had some 'ground work' laid out at the beginning of the movie to give you an idea of how they got to where they were, etc but nothing like that at all. It starts out being boring and kept being boring through the whole movie. IT didn't even have anything at the end when she landed, which might have helped the rest of it from being so boring if there would have been more to the end of the movie, such as..she lands, gets out of the water, then goes SOMEWHERE...would have been nice if George would have shown up, which would not have left everyone thinking he died..IT REALLY NEEDED MORE.",1,9,17,6 April 2014
