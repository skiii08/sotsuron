The Equalizer," All typical topics of thrillers mixed only to justify too much blood
","Denzel Washington has discovered invisibility. He can walk through the city killing all the bad guys, but no one ever see him. He is so proud of his invisibility, that he even rejects taking the guns when he has the opportunity and 10 armed guys in front of him, because it is fancier to kill them with his own hands (or whatever devices he finds around, to make the movie bloodier than needed). Of course, he gives the bad guys the opportunity to repent from their sins, but they reject and he feels obliged to kill them (typical justification of the capital punishment of so many American movies...). All this spiced with the so original wuthering past of a guy who does not like what he does but is forced to do it by the reality, the corrupt policemen, and the dumb friend who finally becomes a hero (if not calling the police when several armed guys are trying to kill someone could be considered a heroicity).",3,0,1,21 July 2015
