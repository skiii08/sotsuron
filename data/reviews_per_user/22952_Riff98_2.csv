E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," One of my greatest childhood memories
",I remember seeing E.T. at the theater in 1982 when I was only 4 years old. It was the first movie I remember crying at. Now that I am a father I would love to take my child to see this movie now that it is being re-released. It is truly a classic and is a movie that will be around for several decades to come. I think anyone who likes great movies is sure to love this movie.,10,1,2,28 February 2002
There's Something About Mary," You've got to be crazy to pass this one up!!
","This movie was so hilarious that I had trouble breathing. People in the theater made it even better with their eruptions of outrageous laughing. The leads Stiller, Diaz, and Dillon are hilarious in this terrific movie about a guy (Stiller) who is looking for redemption years later after being humiliated the night of his prom with his stunning date (Diaz).  I can't tell you how crazy the movie is but the Farrelly brothers took a chance with some outrageous scenes and hit the hammer right on the head. This movie will make you feel great and will make you want to see it again and again",Null,0,0,13 August 1998
