Hereditary," Ultra Creepy with a Powerhouse Performance by Toni Collette
","Very very good acting by toni collette in this! So strong that her grief made me Feel it and sent shivers down my spine...Not often can an actor do this ,at least to me in anything ive watched since i can remember..This movie is ULTRA creepy, with very impressively done Visual cinematography, lighting and Sound that adds immensely to making your skin crawl...This type of movie is genuinely scarey, as opposed to the usual slasher ,blood and gore horror..this gets Under your skin and Into your psyche....so be warned! You may ask if i have such praise for this movie why did i rate it a 7? well, i wont say what it is but the ending fell flat for me and the whole movie itself is dark,depressing,tragic, its something thats so heavy that it may make some people wish they Didnt watch it.....there is a rosemarys baby vibe here at least for me...That movie Definitely qualifies as Ultra creepy as well...anyway, i recommend this one for people who like to get creeped the heck out! It may be too heavy for others...This one is Not my cup of tea,but kudos for the fine performances",7,1,2,9 September 2018
Rocketman," Tedious, Depressing Bio Of an Uninteresting Life
","This was tough to sit through and honestly, I didnt make it to the finish..I was bored while watching this.. It came across as unrealistic and greatly lacked depth . it simply stays on the surface...There was Nothing about this character that caught my interest , it was a shallow study of a man who felt unloved, who lashed out at others who tried to help him and basically came across as a narcissistic and pompous ass..
What did I like? well the actor did a good job with the songs and what he had to work with, but really, it was more the writers and the director who blew it here...I Do like alot of eltons songs and the lead sang them quite well But there is simply NO comparison between this fiasco and Bohemian Rhapsody...one is c grade and the other Oscar caliber acting, cinematography and directing...I cant recommend this one unless you want to see a self centered ,coked up alcoholic parading around the screen for 2 hrs carrying on in the shallowest of ways....Not even remotely oscar worthy",3,5,11,12 July 2019
A Star Is Born," An Oscar worthy Remake with Outstanding Performances
","Lady GaGa just blew me away in this outstanding story! The performances were Oscar worthy from her,Bradley and sam elliot. They were nominated for the oscar and she received it for the incredible vocals and heart she brought to her role, but also
i would say she deserved a shot at the oscar for her acting, which was so damn real, raw, and hearfelt that you would never in a million yrs guess she only recently started acting...she has that 'something' that all great actors have and she is gifted not only in vocals but in her ability to convey through the silver screen, right up there with the best..bradely was fantastic and did his own singing ,which bloody rocked! as well as portraying the grizzled ,alcoholic, uber talented version of a rock star on the skids on his way to oblivion...Supporting actor sam elliot was perfect in his role,just great! Lady ga ga was the real star of this film as she dominated every scene she was in with her presence..There were many times in the movie where i was just struck back by how beautiful a woman she is, especially the times when she was not made up...just a beauty...anyway I still would give the nod to Bohemian rhapsody and its lead Did get the oscar ,but this film deserves to be right along side it as a serious runner up and Ga Ga's incredible and heartbreaking music performances deserved the win they received.. this was such a cool movie, not only about discovered talent rising but also the romance scenes and heart to heart moments between her and bradley, i was glued to the screen and smiling from inside...",10,1,4,15 March 2019
Captain Marvel," Underwhelming Character..Overwhemling CGI
","Having Not been familiar with this marvell character, I didnt know what to expect..Reviewers were saying shes suppossed to be So powerful, she is gonna take down Thanos ect..I was excited to see this Super being who was i guess suppossed to have cosmic power on a level like or beyond superman..Through most of the movie she came across as Underwhelming and was easily bested by many of the others ..I was like 'is This what everyones been talking about?' Not impressed!...The storyline jumps around all over the place, in order to provide a backstory,but it could have been done so much better..it was jarring ,distracting and took Away from the flow of the movie...the Other thing that jumped around as much as the story was the camera work...shaky cam antics on a big budjet sci fi is Really bad directing and should never be done like this....ever! the cgi was very poorly done and at no time do you feel the effects are even remotely believable...The whole purpose of CGI is to create the illusion of a fantastic reality...That does not happen here..its cartoonish and thats being kind.........the character,well, its my 1st time seeing captain marvell portrayed and i dont read comics...she came across as distant, arrogant and not very friendly or likeable..It was cool seeing Coulson,being benjamin buttoned back to looking young...but he and fury were not able to elevate this one...not a very good super heroe movie, there are so many that exceed this by a huge margin that are also from marvell...its not just one thing that brings it down, its the writing, the acting and the CGI.. Anyone who thinks This character is gonna have Any effect on taking down Thanos is mistaken...shes nowhere near strong enough, shes an ant by comparison...strength from the opposition is Not how thanos will be defeated...the only one that can stop thanos is Himself..he will choose to Undo what he has done..thats just my take on it for whatever its worth",4,4,8,24 April 2019
Cloverfield," Shaky Cam at its Absolute Best! Thrillingly Realistic SciFi
","If you are gonna do shaky cam,This is the way to do it! This was
an absolutely thrilling and truly terrifying ride! Fantastic acting with realism that makes this movie Gripping and very Intense.
The monster ,especially at the end, is heartstopping in size and appearance, Whoa! I normally hate shaky cam stuff for its uaually reserved for movies with lame acting ,no plotline and bad effects but here, this movie takes that concept and makes it work..the effects are top notch and terrifying as is the sound mastering..The roars of the monster, the buildings crashing, metal creaking, the thuds and explosions are superb! Just a Wow! movie that deserves a look by any scifi fan..",10,3,3,31 May 2019
"I, Tonya"," Outstanding preformances and Soundtrack
","We all know the story, these actors nailed it! margo was at the best ive seen her in anything yet, and the mother from Hell played it to a tee..There is a sadness to the story ,the harshness and pain of her private life, the possibilities that could have been that will never be.. the soundtrack is one of The best and perfectly matched to the cinematography...how they can make you believe that margo is doing the skating is wild,even when you try hard to see it faked ... this is the kind of movie that draws you in and hold you there till the end..great job!",9,1,3,29 December 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," The worst Attempt at spiderman
","This has got to be The worst attempt at spiderman I've ever seen..I am stunned that people are giving it 10 star reviews as i would barely give it a 3..The character and writing came across as childish and silly..I could barely sit through the the whole shaky cam portion..I really miss Tobeys spiderman as there is no comparison between say spiderman 2 with Doc Oct ,the cinematography and script blow this movie out of the water.. Even the Amazing spiderman guy was light years better at nailing the character..I didn't care for this new guy in Civil War, but that movie was soo good in all other respects that even with this goofy spiderman in the silly suit, the movie pretty much carried him and totally eclipsed his minor role..But in this movie, where everything centers around the new guy, for me it just falls apart..the humor attempts are too forced and the suit design is a big step backwards from the originals.. and wayy too gimmicky... I hope they cast a new actor to do the role for future movies..for now , i will need to re watch some of the older originals just to wash this one from my memory..",Null,7,14,28 July 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Just saw this a 2nd time and still Blown Away
","First off, I am Not a Queen fan, iI neither like nor dislike the group, Ive heard of them before,of course but never really listened to their music nor followed what went on with Freddie Mercury...That said , I was blow the F..k away by the acting of rami malik, this is one Powerful story that is Infinitely sold by the heartfelt transmission of emotion and heart breaking sincerity that literally comes through the screen and from maliks gaze..Just Wow!I knew he was in the I robot series but have never seen anything that he acted in before...after this I am a fan and cant Fathom how he wouldnt be closely considered for the oscar ,Heck, I think he should receive it...That Good!...Even watching it again, with my GF this time, it lost none of its impact and impacted me just as hard and had tears in my eyes many times...The sad loneliness of Freddies story, a man surrounded by people and parties,yet a man alone in his mind, isolated and sad at the end of the day..Malik portrays him in a way that stirrs ur compassion for this man and his path to find himself and live his passion...I always thought of queen as the 'gay' band and just never gave it any attention..This movie made me take a second look and opened my eyes to the talent and person of Freddie Mercury, a unique and ultra talented man...fantastic movie..oscar material if ever there was.",10,1,1,23 February 2019
Man of Steel," Words fail to describe how Beautiful,Stunning and Epic this Blockbuster IS
","I watched this when it debuted and have rewatched it now....Words almost fail me...This is to me, The best of any superman movie...Ever...This is superbly acted by cavil and shannon as well as by the outstanding supporting cast...This hits hard to the heart, you feel for this man, his pain and his inner battles are palpable and brought to life onscreen. Shannon was one of the best ultra villans , but in truth he was trying to save his people and the last of his dying race..sure he Seems the bad guy here but you also empathize with him and what he's trying to do..The effects are still EPIC and jaw dropping..From the incredible demonstrations of the terrifying power of the kryptonians to the inclusion of a 1st contact alien scenario with their huge ships coming in over populated areas to the control of gravity that was lifting everything up,then crushing it to half its size... just wow! As much as we all love christopher reeve and those who have also dorn the cape, Noone has done it as good as henry cavil..he has the physique, the look, the innocence and the intensity, and he can Emote his feelings in such a way as to knock you off ur seat or bring a tear to your eye..the kryptonian, Faora was masterfully played by the actress who brought menace and Ferocity, and Unstoppable force that was terrifying to behold...You got the impression that she held humans in no higher regard than we would ants...Whoa! I love this movie! The audio is stunning on hometheater and I hope there will be a sequel to it ....with Henry of course!",10,0,0,6 July 2020
Salt," Nonstop Adrenalin Rush Female Action!
","Angelina just Rocked this role! Sexy,tough as nails, badass and lethal...Reminds me of 'Alias' but on steroids! this is my 2nd or 3rd viewing over the yrs,cant remember how many times, just that anytime ive watched it ive been blown away..picks up really quick into the movie and doesnt slow its pace at all for the whole remainder till its end...If you like females who are empowered, this ones for you! shes as strong mentally,physically as they come and an unstopple force to anyone in her way...big thumbs up...Atomic Blonde tried this theme but angilina does it way better.",9,6,7,1 October 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Riotously Funny Parody of the 70's. What a Trip!
","I didnt think this was going to be that good, but man, I was wrong! This is classic Tarantino, especially that insane ending that you wont see coming!.. Brad and Leo are at their finest here and Brad just steals the cake ,in the Bruce lee scene and in the ending...God, what a shocking and gut splitting funny ending that was...Im not gonna say What , its just not the ending I thought was coming and it couldnt of been funnier or more tarantino...the whole movie transports you back in time to that 70's vibe....it has it and it takes you there...People who are taking offense to the ending or to bruce lee's scene need to remember that it IS a parody and the very title Does say 'once upon a time'
meaning, the storyteller, tarantino, is gonna take liberties with how it plays out..he does it masterfully and its a blast with his Spin on hollywood...thumbs up!",9,2,7,21 November 2019
1917," Good but Not Oscar worthy
","I had seen all the nonimations ect and had to check this out ...I was expecting to be blown away by story and special effects ect but what I experienced was Underwhelming....the story just didnt have much to it and felt like it dragged with periods of intrest and action and a whole lot of nothing going on in between..Decent acting but not oscar worthy and the story ,i'd only rate as fair, just not that interesting and only a few notches above boring...Good sound and effects when there Was action but mostly the movie is 2 guys chatting as they make their way to their goal and alot of nothing happing in between... ok movie but not a great one",6,1,2,14 March 2020
The Departed," A new review for a Truly Exceptional older Movie
","Just saw this again on netflix, i had seen it years ago when it 1st came out...Holy cow,am I blown the F away! I cant recall if it got the oscar ,but It IS oscar material by any standard..The ensemble of cast here is beyond perfection...nickelson, damon, dicaprio,whalberg,winstone,sheen,vera farmiga,and Baldwin just knocking out of the park and then some...the back and forth dialogues between nickelson and diCaprio and damon going at it with whalberg and on and on..there are so many intense dialogues that are just perfection in how they work..I loved this movie! i had forgotten it completely as it had been abt 13 yrs since I last saw it..had no idea how it was going to play out... as the finale ramped up i was shocked, then shocked again and lastly one more time! Just wow! what a freakin movie... This cast and their caliber of acting just took this movie to stellar levels! off the charts!",10,0,1,18 October 2019
Joker," Dark and Depressing Descent into Madness
","This is Not a movie that will leave you feeling good, thats for sure! Its sad, depressing and very well acted by Phoenix, but its a tough watch ,violent and crazy like a descent into madness.Maybe thats what the director was aiming to achieve and if so, he has succeeded. Didi i like it? No not at all.Did it hold my interest? yes, for the most part,though some sick scenes I fast forwarded through but credit to the lead actor, he played crazy to perfection and his acting held my attention.Did i enjoy it? No not really, it was well acted but a painful watch and not something I'd ever watch again...I wanted to check this out mainly because of heath ledgers stellar performance in the dark knight and I wanted to see how This compared..Well, this actor and his portrayl was head and shoulder above jared leto's joker..Much deeper and more layered than leto but NOT in the same league as ledgers masterpiece..It cant compare....Heaths performance was unique and i can see how Phoenix wanted to bring his own uniqueness to this role...he succeeded,its a joker unlike any other that we have seen but as well acted and as Interesting as ledgers? heck no, not even close...Ledgers joker was one i Wanted to see again and again, and I was blown away each time i watched... whereas this movie, I dont care to ever watch again...it was a curiosity that was satisfied but hold no desire to go through watching it again..",7,0,3,31 October 2019
Black Panther," Not Bad but could be much better
","Wow! what a load of harsh reviews on this movie! I liked it, the cgi effects,that ship of his looked insanely cool..Micheal b jordan was nailing it as the villian! great choice in picking him..The whole movie right from the opening had an air of quality abt is production, at least thats how it struck me..It Did feel much longer than it needed to be and started to get a bit tedious twords the end..The fight scenes were Not good and not even remotely close to being as good as the fight scenes in winter soldier,which is a benchmark for action movies..the fight scenes were slow,ponderous,and showed little in the way of speed and good technique..I loved seeing michone from walking dead and she brought more ferocity than the panther did to her fight scenes,plus she looked smokin hot in the red dress at the nightclub! I hear people complaing abt the accents but for Gods sake if u were native to that continent, thats how people speak! grow up....go to britian or austrailia and you will hear heavy accents as well...The 'other' villian i thought he looked familiar but couldnt place him and then learned that was andy serkis, AKA gollum and planet of the apes actor ect..I am not a comics reader so i never knew the backstory,nor how panther got his powers nor how his suit saved kinetic energy that he could release later...thats seriously cool! anyway overall i liked it! could have been shorter and the fight scenes need to be of a much more adept skill level for a super hero..cgi looked freakin awesome to me...worth a view",7,1,2,19 May 2018
Creed II," A Boxing Movie That could use some Good Boxing
","First off, I have always loved stallones movies ,not for the boxing scenes but more for the story and how it makes you feel..Stallone nailed it with his 1st Rocky and each sequel still has something of that original heart within each tale, even this one..The scenes with rocky and drago were powerful and I wished they were longer..Scenes with rocky and Adonis were also full of feeling and Micheal B deserves praise for the pain and emotion he brought into his character..I know people ragged alot on him for being an empty ,cry baby of a character, but i disagree, he conveyed the pain of loss very well on screen...What is missing in this movie is Good boxing..The fight scenes and training are amatureish with poor form, poor defense and both guys are swinging haymakers with wayy too much followthru ,More a hollywood thing to make the punches look more dramatic ,leaving their arms dangling after wild hooks and their defensive hands down at their chest or waist..no wonder they are getting clocked over and over..Adonis leaving his ribs exposed when he Knows that the russan is going to go there..And Drago literally running across the ring swinging wild and telegraphing everything he throws...defense and footwork seriously lacking from both guys..neither coming across as skilled fighters at the top of their field,but more like guys who had just started boxing with 6 months experience...Rocky movies have never been where you would go to see realistic fight scenes, ever and this is no different..At least in the 1st creed movie, he was boxing with some genuine and real fighters,and micheal b's skills looked cleaner in the 1st movie than in this..that was likely because he was training with real fighters and that elevates ur level when you do..The drago guy was a brute, but not a skilled brute and did not carry himself like someone who was a boxer in real life ....You could go to most any boxing gym and see guys there that would put the guys in this movie to shame..Overall I liked it, boxing realism aside..stallone brings real heartfelt gravitas to his role and uplifts every scene he is in..the Drago storyline Should have been equally developed, as Dolf has a similiar gravitas about him and it would have made for quite the story but instead was never developed...Micheal b, does not really sell me in his role, I honestly liked him better in the 1st creed and certainly his boxing was better..in this movie, his boxing was just off, and not impressive...anyway, its a Rocky movie, and if you like his movies , you know what to expect and will probably like this...I did... it just wasnt one of his best.",6,0,0,15 February 2019
Green Book," A Very Good movie deserving of The Oscar Attention it Got
","The topic matter was not my cup of tea but I like both the actors and wanted to see what all the oscar talk was about...I was Not dissapointed....The acting is impeccable, heartfelt and believable ....Fantastic chemistry here...There is a learning of each man of the other and both horizons are expanded in the end...this is a movie that touches sensitive topic matter in a way that still will leave you at the end with a good feeling...very good movie that deserved to be a runner up in the oscars, but bohemian rhapsody deserved to take the main win as this was good but it was even better.",10,1,6,28 February 2019
