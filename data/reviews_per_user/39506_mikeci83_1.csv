The Blair Witch Project," The presence of the witch can not be seen but felt nonetheless
","The Blair Witch Project was one of the most thrilling films I have ever seen.The Movie does not begin the way you would expect a horror movie to start of, as everything is happy and joyful but later on the build up of suspense is immense.I cannot say that the movie is absolutely terrifying but when the movie is over you realize that it is really scary, the thought of what happened to the 3 students makes you feel terrified that there was something out there.Also it is hard to believe that the movie wasn't real because you see the students 'disappear'.The movie was brilliantly done which is amazing if you take into account how much money was spent on production.I give the movie 10 out of 10 as it was great in both the idea of the movie and the end result.I applaud the writers, directors and actors for they're amazing achievement.If you were planning to go see a great movie then you have made the right choice!",Null,0,0,30 November 1999
