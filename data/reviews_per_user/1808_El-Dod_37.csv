First Man," Is this really the biography film about the 'First Man'. Big dissapointment
","Won't say much about the film cause I love Chazelle's work. The movie is confusing with unimportant details and scenes from his life, the thrilling factor the story should have been based on was almost zero in the film even when it came to the event of landing on the moon that the whole movie was setting up to was completely boring. I felt sleepy during the film and continued it only to see the ending to be disappointed. Good VFX and cinematography. Average direction by Chazelle trying to make masterpiece scenes and making a show in space. The music written for the film didn't suit the scenes and despite being good. Claire's character from the weakness points of the film along with several plots about Neil's life and his struggling with incidents that I didn't understand how It affected him while the story was jumping suddenly to different time of the story. Neil performed by Ryan was soooooo normal and didn't find anything attractive in the character or didn't get to me at all even his reaction but for the opening scene with his daughter issue. very boring and would rather not to see it again considering it one of the weakest biography films I have ever scene which should have become from the best. 5.5/10",6,2,4,22 November 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," That went out bad!
",The movie's story was really exciting but wasn't used well especially in the end. The music written was working on intimidating the audience more than adding to the scene. The characters weren't that good but the actors did a great job in performing them. The movie had some unpredictable shocks that was pretty good but left some plot holes like why Emmett told the truth to Howard even though they could invent any other reason like that they were trying to make a costume as Michelle wanted to be a costume designer. Also some questions Howard's daughter that we didn't know what happened to her or why she wrote 'help' or did he really killed her or why we mentioned the movie mentioned it in the first place and giving wrong picture to Michelle as that Howard was trying to make them really afraid of him thinking that he lied though he could not mention it in the first place. The place where they were hiding was pretty good with most of it's scenes and a good effort was done in it. The ending scene was like a superhero that I feel was a big flop with a shy shot of a monster. Overall I don't feel you should watch but it's worth a shot that I don't much recommend . I give it 6.5 out of 10 sadly for me I was very excited about it.,6,0,0,26 June 2018
A Star Is Born," One of the good musical romance films and a great directional debut for Bradley Cooper.
","The movie is based on and is most powerful at tremendous moving music written and the beautiful songs that of course is winning an Oscar this year no doubt. The story is solid and Bradley really had a great and well studied vision of it with great effort and lots of singing and one hell of a performance among with Gaga who did a great job for her debut as an actress with the chemistry between both which was amazing too and how the screenplay matched with some line that happened in the ending scenes and how all was leading to the end and Bradley gently did the scenes with no trauma but were shocking including the end. However, the story's side of drugs and addiction wasn't much powerful and could say I have seen a lot similar but not performed as good as this one that despite being an important plot for the film It separates me from seeing it as a unique picture and hoped it was another thing and plot. The rhythm of the film decreased towards the end and from what I saw I didn't find a reason for the shocking ending though it seems appropriate for the conditon of Jack but how suddenly the love wasn't a factor in split of a second and what he fought for. Also Ally's rising was fast for me and wasn't clarified much and thought with a movie like that that cared about details should haven't made it as other films when you see the other person standing on stage winning an award. The film devolved into a melodrama so quickly in the end with their fast relationship and felt like it lost the whole thing and just focused on 'Music' The live singing was so powerful and good. The cinematography was good too. But I lost it with the whole matter near the end and felt it was weaker than the beginning until the end arrived.Can't understand much love and overrating and can't understand much hate. I understand that you shouldn't miss the film. 7.5/10",7,0,1,23 November 2018
Wind River," Well, haleluya ! What a movie!
",Wind River is no doubt one of the very intense crime movies to see. Taylor Sheridan did a great job in directing the movie which a lot of directors found it difficult when they are the writers too. He really could present the movie in a very simple style so that you can understand it easily even when Renner was riding the jet going up the snow and made all the details very clear. The music of the movie is very creative and gave the scenes a lot of greatness. The screenplay was good and both Renner and Olsen did a great job especially Renner. The movie is very unfair to be neglected by awards and audience but still happy that it made triple it's budget and is one of 2017's best movies.,8,0,1,22 June 2018
Train to Busan," A hope for the Korean cinema and an alarm that it can be distinctive in the world wide cinema.
","Train To Busan ended the contempt of the Zombie in Hollywood. considering the difficulties that this movie saw to be made, It is very well made with the limited production. The story focused on the father and daughter relation that we moved with through the story. The movie however couldn't make the story more solid where there are some scenes that played very important turns in the plot that was based on coincidence and Exaggerated action by the heroes that made the situation worse and worse but I have to say it most of the movie was very entertaining and made my on the edge of my seat and a lot more was sensible. The bad character I found it overrated and over performed. Gong Yoo Soo-an as The father and as the daughter did a great job in their roles and their relation was the warm part of the movie. I take my hat off to all who worked to bring out this picture and the director Yeon Sang-ho .",7,3,5,26 June 2018
Shaun of the Dead," What the hell!
","Ok, It's a mess in a style. the movie went through lots of overrated things and plots even the ending. The story doesn't have basics or care about anything but gathering the scenes together with expected plots and modest screenplay with Edgar's fashion in direction. Good , but wouldn't rather see it again. 6/10",6,0,1,8 November 2018
Us," Creepy but not as Get out.
","First, the story and it's idea itself is mind blowing and Jordan Peele is one of these directors that has a vision and makes every shot as a picture with a thousand word, but the cast isn't convincing at all with the weak performances, the story had to end with a confusing ending just to add to the film's atmosphere but was expected and didn't had to be like that cause it didn't mean much or important it's just to shock the crowd. The story had lots of plot holes with a very weak screenplay in the situation itself that I waited for any of the characters to ask cause it makes sense but the didn't ask anything and seemed like they are keeping up with what happens and just going with the wave. But still the most important factor is the great Score and music which was 50 percent of every shot's feeling. A little disappointed after high expects. 6.5/10",7,0,1,11 July 2019
127 Hours," That human's damn survival instinct!
","It's a truly hard story to bear as a movie which counts to the film and the director for bringing such a true picture of the story to the screen with the cinematography and the role of Franco's life as he gave his excellent performance.
Thinking of it as a real life story is really brutal and makes you wonder about that instinct and how it can push people over their limits. Everything about the movie is great and it's great score but the overall impression is an 8.5/10 for some editing issues in the slipping of the rock at the beginning of the film scene and some other poor moments of extra suffering. A great film that unexpectedly didn't make me bored seeing a single face 80-90 minutes but
a very harsh one.",8,0,0,7 July 2019
"I, Tonya"," I,Tonya really nailed it in parts and flopped in others
","First Margot Robbie did the role of her life I could really feel how hard she worked , trained and developed herself in the scenes. That kind of roles is really very challenging and she nailed almost everything in it and in the skating part was perfect. Sebastian did a good job too and they got along together giving some awesome scenes. The music was good for me but was compatible in some scenes as it was in the beginning . Allison Janney was superb that I really felt she's Tonya's real mother she was absolutely amazing. The screenplay was good and reflected the characters pretty well but the movie was covered by that theme of the year's end movies that looks dull in most of it. The direction and the preview of the movie was very good but wasn't as good as it was in the beginning. the rhythm decreased in the end but the main problem of the movie was in some characters and one of the tellers of the story that didn't matter to exist in the movie though if he is in real life and the dropping of Tonya's behaviours and her reaction to the problem and some talking of her ex husband that wasn't as the truth and was completely conflicting. Don't miss that movie it is a great one. 8/10",8,0,0,23 June 2018
Molly's Game," Seen like it before despite Andy Sorkin's good direction.
","Lots of talk , The protagonist isn't as I expected from the trailer . A good start for Andy Sorkin. Jessica was good , The screenplay with lots of talk and the incidents are a little bit boring. Wouldn't rather watch it again.",5,4,7,14 July 2018
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," My rating doesn't mean it's bad.
","The movie is bold in most of his scenes and sometimes shocking. Johnny's performance was very magnificent though the character it's self has not got much to present even in it's past. Helena was pretty good too and both were drawing a picture with their performance, but the movie isn't too powerful and the songs were at ups and downs. Overrated and predictable plots too and scenes with blood were neither convincing nor horrifying just sometimes shocking. In the end, it's a good movie presenting a story in a more theatrical and poetic way. 6.5/10",6,0,2,10 November 2018
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump!
",Tom Hanks was superb you can't really differentiate him from the character of Forrest Gump. The story is unique and the direction was good. The movie's music wasn't helpful at all could have added more greatness to the scenes. The rhythm of the movie slowed at some parts and was quick at others but the only thing that bothers is that a character like Forrest after all of that could have been used better and had better situations and more effective and I really thought of it as a great performance by Hanks although I don't feel most of the scenes were the ones that could show us the character and make it way more epic but you will be taken by hank's performance which was the spine of the movie. His love Jenny I suppose wasn't that serious character that fits to guide him or help him and should have been another character that makes that great effect in his life. The telling of the story and camera movements were absolutely gorgeous and Robert Zemeckis did a great job in it along side with the scenario which reflected the characters so well.In the end a great movie! 8.5/10,8,1,1,14 July 2018
Nightcrawler," That freaking complex psychologically written psychopath! Wow!
","Nightcrawler is one of the movies that is on the blacklist of the academy for the most awesome movies that they don't appreciate it by
nominating it to that number of Oscars it deserves. As for this movie it really should have been nominated for 6 more Oscars and giving a guaranteed one to Jake for his Physically, mentally and Psychologically prepared Performance with his stable reactions that gave with the scenario that both shocking and creepy feeling for the character and made it so realistic to the audience. The movie had too many things that made it look that good , In my opinion, one of them is presenting the character in it's early starts and putting him in different situations that made you both sympathetic with and shocked at him.
The screenplay that was perfectly written for the character that added to it mentally and psychologically and made you feel with Jake's performance that you have just a complete character with it's lack of feelings in front of you on screen. The music of the movie was good too and makes you feel intense and excited in some scenes but it's presence lacked in the end. The story
is very good and it's characters are good but some other characters weren't either written well or performed well as the female FBI agent. Disn't feel Riz Ahmed or hia character that I found is a helping reason for some incidents and not the goos type and the ending scene was fake for him.
The story's only problem I fell it was the sequence where we were infront of many actions and presenting the character then stopping for the big action in the end that made you feel too much lunacy and strange stable reactions and discovering his mean self that only puts his benefit at first even on other people's lives which made me a little bit bored that we are getting deeper and deeper into showing his psychopathic character.
Overall the movie is too good with one of the very complex protagonists. Very entertaining in most of it and of course faced injustice . Check it out. 8.5/10",8,0,0,28 June 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Not that much Rhapsody!
",The film is an average one with below average direction and quick not organised story. Rami's performance was great though at Freedie's young stages felt some of himself and not Freedie's in real life though he was awesome I knew that all this awards came from that 'gay' thing that hollywood will give awards to any movie and actor that talks about it. The disaster story that didn't present anything well even Freedie and his actions and confidence in addition to moving quickly between events and didn't present him in full dimensions but for the older stage. The below ordinary editing and on of the worst sound mixing that was suddenly nominated for an Oscar though you will notice in the end Rami's mouth not going with the song playing of Freedie and that lip-synch was very bad. The music was good and the performances were good too except the stupid relationship between Freedie and the other 'toto' guy. The movie didn't appeal to me at all and didn't feel anything great about it and didn't give me the awesome feeling of such awesome band. I am with critics in this one. 5.5/10,5,1,3,28 January 2019
Bird Box," Can't deny it's impressive but still wasn't that masterpiece!
","Bird Box is my first Netflix movie to see and no doubt is one of the most challenging films of the year. The film is fine though I wasn't much satisfied but a little disappointed. The music of the film is weak and I didn't feel it added to the scenes' emotions and value. The screenplay was pretty good too with some silly chats as most of usual screenplays. The story is good but it's this kind of film that destroys itself by itself, Sandra is the hero with her excellent performance and her character but the story had to be like any other story and put less than ordinary characters that are silly and full of weakness points along with some unanswered incidents from some characters and also has that lack of horror and only play on thriller and surprise making noises and you know it's nothing and the sexual things that didn't need to exist with some predictable plots and and others that doesn't seem right like the creatures matters and mentioning causes against what we see and didn't bother to show anything about them or describing and visuals of what really happens in a great challenge too that the film failed to impress about it. Also the middle of the end was boring and the idea though it's new and professional had omitted sensible things to happen especially in the Nile scenes and was based on luck. In the end, the story also had two good leaders with solid performances from Malkovich and Trevante Rhodes though Malkovich's character wasn't that good. And I would like to say ' A unique story that could have been way more better'. 6/10",6,0,3,6 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," 'It's just a leap of faith' and this unique movie did it, way to go everybody.
","I begin with a simple question 'why did it take more than 20 years of modern animation to think to make superheroes from comic books an animation comic book style movie?'.
I think that it's one of the unique animation films you gonna ever see. The rendering style of the comic books that the animation is based on in no doubt superb and I feel it fits superheroes more than the marvel kinda thing though I am not quite sure as both are very extraordinary. The movie is creative and gonna be the first in a series of non boring superheroes movie that made a category for itself in this unique rendering style. The animation along with the movie's score are the heroes of the film with a tons of visual metaphors. The story itself is unique and creative but it was just so quick in it's events along with some of the action scenes which seemed very unclear and random and went out of order especially in the ending scene. Also the ending scene of the story along with it and the dimensions kinda stuff went out of order and made me confused especially the story and the origin of the multiple Spider-Men especially that of Spider-Woman and her relation with Peter Parker who is from another dimension than her! The 3 other Spider-Men were for me neglected and wasn't defined enough for that some of their powers were mentioned in the trivia of the film here on imdb that I didn't know about. The movie itself deserves a 10/10 for as a whole picture which was a real adventure that could have gone wrong but it went out with stealing an Oscar from Disney's movies at the end of the year marking a complete surprise and a well deserved win indeed. It stole it with the catchy story and the idea of multiple Spider-Men and the crazy costumes along with the comic book animation style, light comedy, score and songs and most importantly the comments that we are used to see in a comic book like 'booooow' which was terrific. The classy Spider-Man jumping and swinging from a building in the end scene in this movie's style with the literally out of this world cinematography making a great combination with the costumes and again the animation. As for me, the movie is described by one word which is 'wooooooow' and would give it a 10/10 (which it deserves) but for the storyline and unclear action and fight scenes along with the ending though it's superb. Don't you dare miss it 9/10",9,2,4,2 March 2019
Monsters vs. Aliens," A weird good animation movie!
",The characters of the movie is very funny weird all of them especially Bob. The movie has a lot of comedy in it. The story is good and music is good tough the movie had some problems. Other characters weren't necessary as the president. Can't be compared to more professional animation movies but in the end a good one indeed. 6.5/10,6,0,0,27 June 2018
Avengers: Endgame," The great grand epic finale for an all time great conclusion!
","I just came back from the cinema and this movie will last forever for being able to bring out together all emotions and all those incidents in 3 hours. The movie was a bit slow in the first 80-90 minutes which comedy concentrated in somehow sometimes annoying and distracting Thor dominated over which for me could have been reduced to 30-40 minutes but still I understand the details but really the comedic scenes though they were funny were distracting sometimes for me.
My scale to great endings is always harry potter and this movie really had the epic ending and very satisfying and heroic ending but still may find Harry Potter's better for some reasons. Not one of them is knowing the ending but knowing the end for some characters, also being able to predict some upcoming events in the end is a weakness in the plot which was for me the big trouble.
Captain stupid Marvel was really weak and not as powerful as I thought or even much affecting and it's for the me the strongest weakest hero in the MCU and feel like they aren't able to use her even in the end and the glove and taking the stones shot which costed the traumatic yet predictable end for some character and although had a great effect in the final battle but it felt like she is the strongest with the stupidest brain to use her powers more on the contrary my favorite one which is 'Thanos' who was not much powerful but smart enough to beat the crap out of everybody and brought enthusiasm and all the action near the end and had one of the best fight scenes ever with Captain America, another disadvantage is that Hawkeye for me still wasn't used or made a the powerful impact I was waiting for, also the soul stone though knowing that a sacrifice is a must to earn they plan for getting all the stones and all their places in old dates and incidents but yet a huge scene was made which costed a lot for such a serious thing that they didn't agree what to do for it and the time travel matter concerning their arrival together after the missions and Nebula's delay but still arriving with them along with some points in it feels like they distracted us with the following eventful incidents.
The VFX in the film is a must Oscar winning one in the great finale battle with the camera angles and the simple score all were more than fantastic. The performances were very great and the direction for the Russo is an example for all time great direction and should be an example for powerful ones. The movie also had the great ability to create challenges and overcome them like the way it moves from extreme comedy to extreme drama and action, the scenario was also good and especially along the end with the good movie score, I also still believe the comedic part should have made the movie's genres include comedy for occupying much time in the film though it was very funny at parts and distracting at others but was too hilarious and well written. In the end again the final epic battle is an all time great scene with much enthusiasm that exceeds much of Infinity Wars' and again as a fan the movie deserves a 10/10 but for me along with stupid ass funny Thor😂 I would give it a 9.5/10 and what prevents me from giving it a 10/10 is being somehow predictable at some points regardless of what the ending was and I still hope Marvel never stops making movies like that and affecting on our characters by the characters and heroes of the great absent Stan Lee.",9,0,4,25 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Another great director that after I know him well makes a movie that may be his least best!
","I was very excited to see this movie, it has been in my watchlist since it was announced or even before, but I have to say this disappointed because rising the expectations after what was said about this film and giving it a 10/10 by the president of IMDB or whatever he is. The movie may be Tarantino's least film in my opinion. Leonardo DiCaprio is the only great thing in this movie, his excellent performance really is what made me love the movie though I don't get the story but his story is the most clear one in the movie. I really won't accept less than an Oscar nomination for him being the only living actor still did not disappoint us. I am reallly deeply in love with the scene in the trailer where he says 'Rick Fu***** Dalton' that scene is a story by itself and may be one of the greatest scenes ever which counts for Tarantino. Brad Pitt also performed a descent performance as he always does and had a good chemistry with Leonardo. Margot Robbie's role is the strangest thing for me that It didn't need to exist at all, I didn't know what was the purpose of having here in it, it didn't make any impact thought she acts good, If you erased her from the movie nothing and I repeat nothing will change or anything gets affected by it's absence even if it was a parallel story, it didn't seem of what was represented in the movie a rich story to tell. Tarantino tried to make it have a dramatic scene of loving cine,ma but it failed for me greatly. The idea of the story is great but I say that Tarantino didn't make the best of it as we didn't see any scenes of real stunts during shooting with the presence of Leonardo and Pitt together as Pitt is his stunt double so wasn't it logic to see one scene where he is stunt doubling him! Also Brad's story had some action that lead to a grand great finale which I consider the real part of a Tarantino movie and one of the best endings ever.
In the end, It's a movie that has some touches of Tarantino but not all of it. 7.5/10 for Margot's unnecessary role as it has a big part of the film and the boredom at some points of Brad's story and the movie as a hole.",7,2,4,4 August 2019
Gone Girl," Fincher did a great job in building incidents and then collapsed all ! I am really not a fan.
","Okay , The movie had an average start even very slow then very quick rhythm giving away what was planned by the wife at once just before the middle then only focusing on that psychopath wife and the rest of the plot when an unplanned accident happened in her plan and then preparing for the ending which was a complete mess with lots of plot holes and unreasonable behaviours especially when both married couple had everything cleared the cards were exposed. The movie had a slow scheme then rising slowly till the end then collapsed with that mess that I felt you were afraid that the days would end before you finish the ending!. I am not trying to have a different opinion about that critically acclaimed movie but really the total scheme flopped from our director who only focused on bringing the wife to the screen with the more than good performance by Rosamund Pike and was a mess in the rest of it even the music didn't add anything to the scenes. Try to understand a complete mess and no entertaining only curiosity what that girl had done before she was gone and what she is doing when that plan had a turn. 6.5/10",6,0,2,1 July 2018
Get Out," Tell me I did not just see that! Wow!
","Jordan Peele's directional debut is superb!. The story is really creative and solid in almost everything with some unreasonable actions. The whole cast did a great job especially the black ones (and I am sorry for using black but it's the beautiful special thing in them and what the movie depends on) who could really reflect the plot of the movie on their faces and weird behaviours and Kaluuya did a very great job that deserved the academy nomination. The cinematography and the scenario were pretty good and that's a basic thing to give a movie it's successful weight that a lot of movies should learn along side with the awesome music written for it which was a great combination together. In the end a must watch movie that is very exciting,entertainment and well made. I give it 9/10 for some unreasonable actions and the lack of horror which is a great unefective defect in it .",9,1,6,23 June 2018
The Theory of Everything," A very true movie and very very superb!
","The great incredible story of professor Stephen Hawking was sincerely reflected on screen through the The Theory of Everything movie. I have to start with Eddie Redmayne's performance which genuinely exceeds any other performance I have ever seen in my life and in cinema, I really thought for a whole bunch of time I was watching the professor himself especially in his advanced stages of motor neurone disease , It's that kind of performance that still no award is made for it. Felicity did a great job too and had a beautiful chemistry with Eddie. The music of the film was very beautiful and a great companion to the performances and the screenplay was beautiful and careful too. The story only focused on his suffering with a small glimpse about his extraordinary theory and his genius mind which seemed to me as a story of a person that was suffering from a rare disease and was challenging to live and came up with a tremendous theory which could fill some parts where the story was away from him focusing on his wife and how in my opinion she was as he told her in the beginning that she was unaware and taken when she offered that they marry by what she did in the movie in the end of the movie and when he lived more than two years which was so awful and a very bad ending to such a great effort done with such a great person and I would rather It showed any situation including his children and how they dealt with him and how they got used to him in that condition without deviating from his story and facing the disease and how genius he was. In the end the movie is included in the 1001 must watch movies before you die so don't miss it. 8.5/10 with a great salute.",9,0,1,15 July 2018
A Quiet Place," No doubt one of the best horror/thriller ever made and one of 2018's best movies!
","I really loved the movie in everything, the movie is a distinctive state by itself that really people at the cinema were afraid to make a sound and there was only silence. The movie is amazing in all of it's components Emily Blunt was superb a very powerful role for her that could be a chance to be nominated for an Oscar. The kids were very good too and their performance was excellent. The hero of that excellence John Krasinski that had a very special vision for this movie and it was very new and creative too. His performance was solid too and powerful. The music written for the movie gave intense to the scenes and made me on the edge of my seat all the time. The editing and how the sound differs when the camera moves to the small girl was very attractive to the mode and a distinctive audio experience. The little scenario that was presented in the form of sign language was the last beautiful touch to the whole picture that gave it and the characters the whole silent atmosphere. However the movie wasn't free of very obvious problems, one of them was the cause of the great incidence which appeared in the trailer that our female protagonist was pregnant and that's strange that they thought of having a child to this world that would make a lot of voice and could get them all killed and even the idea of bringing him to this agony wasn't correct. Some plot holes in the movie especially in the epic ending scene which could have been better written. Another assumed one was that the movie's horror wasn't as expected but no one noticed that it is rated pg-13 which was a challenge to the movie as making Dunkirk a war movie with the same rating and the amount of horror was enough for that rating. In the end a very rare and distinctive experience that anyone who didn't watch at the cinema lost it . Definitely don't miss that movie it's indescribable and amazing.",9,1,4,28 June 2018
The Imitation Game," Another great endlessly effective mind.
",The movie is good and the performance is charming by Benedict that you feel he broke another Enigma which was Alan's character. The music is very good written and added to the value of the scenes. However the direction was average and the story really didn't present that historical incident well and focused more in Alan's sexuality. Also it was predictable and had no worries watching it knowing that it will happen and they will break the Enigma code and that was the challenge to make you doubt that it will happen and present the suffering and work done to achieve it and focusing on it's result and on the war too and it's effect on it. The characters were very full of stories and feelings that could have been used instead of having unnecessary scenes and focusing on how to present the smartness of Alan's mind not telling us he is a smart and has a different attitude than others and you know that it will work in the end. Also small Alan was different than the big one that I felt the small one was performing another Alan with a mental disorder.Also Keira's character wasn't powerful or had any difficult scenes to present her well. However the movie is full of good scenes with performance and music and irresistible to watch.,7,0,0,4 July 2018
Prisoners," That's how a movie is done.
","Denis Villeneuve is no doubt one of the very few directors that have vision and a complete look at the story before he direct it. He brought the picture so intelligently with a lot of references and small details that as any other big director he gave clues to and used it in important scenes. The movie has that way of telling from lot's of camera angels and telling style that makes you in complete vision of it's details. The music of the movie was good but didn't give the scenes the intense or add to it . The acting was excellent by Hugh Jackman who performed the character of the father so well and was a very challenging role that he succeeded in it and by Jake Gyllenhaal gave a solid performance as the cup and the rest did a great job. The movie's problem is that it focused more on showing the suffering of the family and especially the father and on the cup trying to understand what's wrong with him doing some silly actions especially when he went to ask Alex in his home as If he would tell him!. The characters of his friend wasn't good and didn't add to the movie neither did his wife. The ending was acceptable though it not very good one but for the last scene of course with the hint of the small detail of his daughter. Overall, very violent , heart moving and has a lot of mystery in it. Don't miss a chance watching it.",8,3,4,27 June 2018
Silence," Seriously, For this Martin Scorsese said that the cinema he knew ended!!?
",The movie is good but very average and exaggerated with average performance and a very good one by Garfield. The whole atmosphere of it was perfect but the movie had a lot of problems that I felt someone is talking not a cinematic movie where a lot of scenes where taking too much time of the movie while we could move to it's end and the skipped parts didn't contain any good details. Also the whole silence Idea was presented by the good screenplay and muting the sound in some parts but the whole meaning was very bad and not intelligently presented too. I have to say a good movie I rather not to watch again. 6/10 and respected for it's effort.,6,0,2,13 July 2018

Sicario," Not my cup of tea though it's a unique one.
","Sicario is no doubt a very well made film with a director with a vision and imagination as he is always. The music written for the film along with the cinematography must be taught to those who want to make a good movie. The action scenes were done brilliantly by Villeneuve and made me in the middle of the action as If I were there along with the camera movement and it's live shooting with the direct gun shooting. However, despite the great performances , the movie lacked a powerful story and protagonist, by power I mean a solid story with more action scenes and not stretching in the drama and plot scenes that caused me some boring. Also Emily's character despite being the protagonist was completely restricted to it's fear , Ignorance of what's happening and being shocked. Even the movie's end didn't depend on her but gave her a scene in the end which was completely pointless for me and through her vision I couldn't feel the whole film as It suppose to be and it's pointless to have her neglected like that. I can tell that It's one of the weakest protagonist I have ever scene despite being a good character. Villeneuve's work and scenes are distinctive in the film , but the drama scenes that most of the film depended on it with a few action scenes wasn't that good. I say that I can be satisfied with cinematography , the music , the 3 or 4 action scenes including the beginning and ending and not satisfied about the rest even the screenplay that had good lines. 6.5/10",7,0,1,9 November 2018
The Disaster Artist," A good comedy and an average movie.
",James Franco performed Tommy wiseau so good and directed the movie well too. Dave Franco was not bad and The movie's story is so funny however not much comedy came out of it. Also the lack of the effect of the music of the movie could have made the scenes a lot more better and give them more better look. The movie's rhythm was boring a little bit too. The scenario was too fit for the characters. The movie lacked entertaining and only the scenes in the trailer are the good things in it. Only watch it to see James as Tommy. 5.5/10,6,0,1,27 July 2018
A Beautiful Mind," A very warming experience with a very heartbreaking story.
","The story of professor John Nash is incredible and the movie was just very good in portraying his tragedy and what he had been through was only his beautiful mind that is facing the impossible and was good in expressing his wife's struggle , love and patience with him and both was performed incredibly well by Russel and Jennifer , both deserved the Oscar not only Jennifer. However Ron Howard did a good job in the movie but I think he didn't really deserve his Oscar cause the movie really could have been a lot better with lots of tears and of course a lot of other meanings from that genius person's story and only depending on the warm music and performance of the leading actors wasn't close to what this story could have become with another more intelligent director. By this I don't mean to Underestimate his good job in the movie but I guess many other awards agree with me that he did a good job but didn't do his best only the Oscars that refused to give it to Peter Jackson. The story too didn't focus on his smart and the people around him more than it focused on his problem and tragedy that I felt he was a genius person his tragedy prevented him from using his mind and his family suffered to make him better. The whole cast was superb and the music was the feeling of the movie very warming and passionate. Don't miss it. 7.5",8,0,2,3 July 2018
War of the Worlds," Not from Spielberg's good movies, and not even a good one!
",The movie is a very ordinary film with nothing creative or new at all. The same usual story of father and his children where the father doesn't know a thing about them as they live with their mother and he is reckless then something tragic happens and this relationship develops with and the movie failed at both the invasion story with moderate effects in my opinion compared to Harry Potter's at that time and the story of Tom cruise and his children with a very unique annoying scene which represents the most important one with tons of unreasonable screaming from Dakota Fanning along with Tom's son which was a not charming character even acted badly but still Spielberg's touches and enthusiasm appeared clearly in some scenes and shots which gave the movie it's thriller part that forced me to complete the story the film with a good performance by Cruise and lack of the movie's score or background music. 5/10,5,2,3,27 February 2019
Marriage Story," A solid divorce story!
","I will have to start by saying that this is my first Noah Baumbach film and I have to say it didn't disappoint me but didn't reach my expectations as well. The three basic reasons for the success of this film is Noah , Scarlett and Adam. This movie is an acting ring having Scarlett and Adam competing with Noah as a referee and he handled the match perfectly. But I felt that Adam's performance was way better than Johansson's in every scene they were in it together I couldn't take my eyes off him even the master scene between them he won at the end of that scene with a K.O. Scarlett is doing her first awesome performance but I can't say it is one of the greatest performance ever but I can relate If she won the Oscar this year cause of the lack of powerful performances in Leading Actress category. The screenplay and the way Noah told this movie felt like I were in the 60s of the 2010s! The scenes and the looks of it made me feel most of it that it was in the past a really perfect look for each scene. The screenplay almost concluded everything that has to do with the divorce matter and lawyers interference in the whole subject and turning it into was. However, the movie had boring moments and the sexual stuff in it especially for Scarlet's character felt unnecessary on the contrary it is frequent with men which was represented by Adam's character without getting to show it. Also If the score of the film was stronger, it would have added to the scenes a make a better value for them but it was silent most of the film and even at the master scene itself. Didn't feel the kid much in this film or his acting too. In the end, a good movie to watch but I don't think I would watch it again. 7/10",7,4,5,26 December 2019
The Greatest Showman," That's a movie where you don't need critics, only joy and entertainment. Wow!
","Absolutely amazing! First, Critics sometimes forgets that it criticizes when a movie is underestimated in it's beliefs and the concepts of it's making. The Greatest Showman is by far one of the freshest movies that leaves an impression , feeling of joy and making you so taken in it. The purpose of any movie is having that state of greatness and influence and making you after watching it not the same as you were before. This is a kind of movie that needs you just to enjoy with it and be simple and If you are very that kind of person that watches to criticize it's not your kind of movie. The Performances of the cast are beautiful. Hugh you could how happy he is doing the project he deserves a salute for his ambition and persistence to make it. The music of the movie of course was the hidden hero of it very wonderful and the movie have some songs that will have you very stunned and amazed and thrilled. The directional debut of Michael Gracey is very beautiful but not free of problems. The movie's only problem was the story and how some characters aren't written well and it's sequence which was kinda not good and you might feel there are problems now I can't see and feel disturbed by how quick the scenes are but the were done very professional and the dances and the shows even though as Indian movies you feel it disturbs the story but let's agree that the movie's purpose was only joy and deeper feelings that doesn't deserve to be looked at from the surface only. Don't miss that movie , watch and enjoy with your family. 8.5/10",8,1,2,8 July 2018
300," A good war movie.
","The movie is thrilling with war scenes that were very good made. The plot was weak. The rhythm of the movie and it's shape in the end is really what bothers me that I sometimes can imagine the green screens. In the end , watch for fulfilling it's main cause very good which is war.",7,1,3,13 July 2018
Green Book," One of the most intelligent films I have ever seen with very affecting performances.
","The movie is really fantastic with Viggo and Mahershala giving a very simple excellent performance with me loving Viggo more. The story is superb along with the screenplay of the characters which was very terrific with some awesome quotes that can go on forever.
The best thing I like about the story that it didn't have to be R rated to show racism and give us much violence to describe it. It only showed this with absolutely no loud voice or profanity or anything more than
looks and very simple situation, for me the whole movie is excellent in it's impossible simple way of telling the story with the simple performances that lacked the presence of better music that would have made the scenes a lot more better. Also the whole Green Book matter in the film wasn't clear for me even when it was opened and couldn't understand it's presence that much more than that it's because it's the movie's title!. Also hopped that it didn't get to the sexuality and that kinda stuff which sometimes is not necessary in the movies especially this one and only to attract some audiences which I am totally against. Viggo's character will be me favorite for a long while and for me he was even better than Rami's performance at Bohemian Rhapsody. Mahershala deserve the Oscar that he will win for that strong expressions and emotions although he and Viggo had some entertaining master acting scenes comedy and drama.
In the end, one of all time favorite films and don't miss a chance to see that film 8.5/10",8,1,1,2 February 2019
Incredibles 2," The Incredibles are back after 14 years and they successfully could have a new unique style as we hoped!
","First, This is one of the most entertaining, funny , comedy and creative animation movie and sequel ever made. The animation is so unique and the very creative action scenes and the innovative super powers of Jack Jack and his very unique awesome comedy which was the hero of the movie and depended on it a lot with the cuteness and sweetness of that beautiful baby. Our heroes and their superpowers appeared on screen very entertaining and beautiful but for Mr. Inrcedible whom I think was mistreated and Marginalized. Also the very obvious plot wasn't a good idea but I don't now whether the movie meant it or not. Some people might find a problem with the developed animation of our heroes and looking a little diffrent but you really should get over it cause we are talking about a 14 year gab and enjoy that awesome experience at the cinema. The ending was good but wasn't convenient for the rest of the movie and it's awesomeness and even some problems appeared in the end. But in the end the movie stands as one of 2018's best movies and best animated movies ever made with lot's of details and fun. Not better than the first cause it's modern with the new styles today but had much of it's original feeling in it and was absolutely by today's ratings a very professional and well made movie with a beautiful story. Don't miss it.",9,1,2,13 July 2018
Valkyrie," A below average film with no thrilling!
","I was looking forward to seeing the film and was pleased from the beginning then everything went off the record and was boring. Tom's performance wasn't convincing at all I thought he was himself and the character wasn't attractive at all with absolutely no reactions until near the end not because it is about war it should be as he performed it. Also the difference in it's personality after the beginning wasn't much convincing too as I read about stauffenberg and he said 'remarked to friends never to have really known what to do with so many fingers when he still had all of them' which refers to a very solid and aggressive character. Everything was good at the beginning and in the end, the music, the cinematography, the acting was better, but along the film it was very average and boring with plots though I had't read about the operation much easily predicted. won't recommend it. 5.5/10",5,0,1,23 November 2018
