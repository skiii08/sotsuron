Hereditary," What a load of rubbish
","This is my first review on IMDB but felt it totally necessary to give my opinion. After reading the first 10 reviews ranting how fantastic this movie was I decided to give it a go. Well, what a load of rubbish. The acting is brilliant and the director was very original. The story line is a bit strange with a few wtf scenes but the ending is just absolutely ridiculous. After wasting 2 hours watching this movie I'm utterly dissapointed.",3,0,3,1 September 2018
