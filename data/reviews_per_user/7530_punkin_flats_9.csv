Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I loved it! Couldn't stop laughing!
","Let me start by saying this movie is not for everyone. But then, what movie is for everyone? The movie is not politically correct and pokes fun at every race and social class. You will find yourself laughing loudly when it is your social class for some warped reason. However if you like to laugh uproariously at stupid, crude, humor it is for you. I caught it one day on satellite when I was home alone. It was a movie I thought that I would never ever like from reading other reviews about it. But I was dead wrong. I was entranced by the fast pace and the whole thing got over with way too soon for my liking. I wish there would be a sequel made! I caught myself laughing way too loud since nobody was home to chastise me. It was the type of movie where a lot of stuff seamlessly came together. Some slapstick comedy, goofy badly spoken and accented English, and cultural misunderstandings are the mainstay of the script and they are brilliantly assembled by Cohen. It put me in the mind of the BBC TV show, Little Britain. I may secretly buy myself a DVD copy of this for Christmas.",10,0,4,18 May 2008
Two for the Money," Funny dialogue, had me laughing out loud
","I went into watching 'Two For The Money' cold- had not read anything about. I enjoyed it! Pacino had some hilarious dialogue. I kept on laughing throughout the movie at his witticisms. I read some other postings, yes, Russo was towering over Pacino as his wife. I would take this that Pacino was secure in his life and could handle having a tall woman walk with him. We all know Russo was a fashion model in real life. Many short, powerful men want a woman like that. As to another posting, yes Matt M. was a light-weight, but boy did he give beefcake appeal! I liked his shirtless scenes. Who cares if the boy can act?? Then shock of shocks, one of my 70's favorite actors popped up- -Armand Assante! I was so happy to see him! I wish he had more screen time. Seeing three of the four actors/actresses as big names, I was happy overall with the movie. The running time flew by for me.",8,11,17,20 February 2006
Alexander," Wonderful Epic- sit back, watch, and enjoy
","Wonderful thought-provoking large scale epic. I had very little knowledge of Alexander, I just watched the movie for pure enjoyment. I was not disappointed. I tell friends, just sit back, get a tray full of snacks, popcorn, and coffee and enjoy! The movie was about 65% battle scenes, campground discussion, battle preparation, and moving speeches to the troops. The rest of the movie gave background story, Angelie Jolie's behind-the-scenes encouragements, evil doings of the family, etc. The battle scenes were awesome, I have never seen anything like this in my life. You could see how the Greeks fought hand to hand with sometimes no more than a spear and a shield. Hardly anybody was on horseback except the leaders. It was rough and violent to the max. The soldiers were so brave and actually some of them were very old. It really makes you think about modern warfare when you see this type of fighting. It was different than Troy with Brad Pitt.",9,0,10,14 August 2005
A Bridge Too Far," Great movie! seemed well made and truthful
","I enjoyed this movie immensely and I'm a woman! Usually a WW2 war movie bores me, but this had such amazing twists, turns, and odd things that happened! I loved the huge cast, there was no one leading person to take over the majority of the scenes. I definitely will get the Cornelius Ryan book and read it. The movie seemed to be very long, I haven't checked the run time yet. I only took one break from the room and my husband stopped the DVD player so I didn't miss anything. I just sat entranced watching the action. Actually, I am glad it was a very long movie, I would hate to see an edited (shortened) version, as every scene that was included seemed to be important.",9,2,4,15 November 2005
Crash," Horrible upsetting movie NOT a date movie by any means
","Horrible, upsetting movie. I wish my husband had never brought home this rental piece of junk. It was full of racism, violence, carjackings, and death. No thank you. All it did was fill my head with ugliness and scenes of violence. I would tell any woman not to rent this movie or ever watch it - - it is very very upsetting. This was not entertainment, it was like being on jury duty (which I had 2 summers ago). It was more like a police report for a week's activity in Los Angeles. All it did was show the dirty side of life. If you like gritty, upsetting movies, by all means, watch this. If you want light hearted entertainment, watch something else. All this will do is give you nightmares.",1,6,16,11 September 2005
The Machinist," A waste of viewing time - disgusting and creepy
","Like I have said in past comments, we watch 365+ movies a year at my house. This movie was the pits. I don't knock a movie just because I don't like an actor/actress, I try to write up a description as I would recommend a movie to a friend. I had never seen any of Christian Bale's acting before this. His acting was fine from what I saw, but the starvation bit was too much for me. All it did was depress the heck out of me and I could not pay attention to the plot for staring at his bag-of-bones body and stick-thin arms. It was borderline sickening. Why would you starve yourself and risk organ failure and/or heart attack like this? I have heard of suffering for your craft, but this was ridiculous. I would have turned it off, but my husband will always watch a movie to the bitter end. If it was up to me, it would not have lasted ten minutes. If you want to be grossed out by starvation, hey, rent the thing. The other actors and actresses he interacted with were fine and normal people. I noticed the 'Year 2000' blue color we were all supposed to be using also. What was it, cerulean blue or something similar? If you remember, this was used heavily in 'Joe Vs. The Volcano' to show us the depression of working in a lousy office job. In 'Machinist' it's used to depress us in the tool and die factory. Please, I have to end this now and erase this movie from my memory.",1,11,31,28 June 2005
The World's Fastest Indian," Plot similarities to Schultze Gets The Blues (2003)
","This was a very very entertaining movie that kept you on the edge of your seat during many parts. After we were about half-way into it, I said it was an almost identical plot to 'Schultze Gets The Blues.' (2003). I guess you would call this a 'Quest Movie.' Both men (Burt Munroe and Schultze) are 'foreigners' (New Zealand and Germany) going to the United States to chase a dream (motorcycle racing and Cajun music). Munroe does have to travel a greater distance than Schultze does. Both men are older and unmarried. They have spent much time thinking about taking their passions to America. Their neighbors/friends like them and overlook their obsessions and quirks because they are generally mild mannered men and good hard working people. They (the neighbors and friends) realize that these men won't be happy until their Quest is over. So they rally around them (literally and figuratively speaking) and send them off because with the men being rather seasoned in age, they might only get one chance at doing this. Both Munroe and Schultze have language difficulties, Schulze obviously having the greatest since he speaks only German. But Munroe has his own, even though he speaks English. I won't say any more than this, but if you watch the two movies you will see the striking similarities. While I am on the subject, I can't think of any female 'Quest' movies like this, since women in society aren't usually encouraged to traipse across the continent, and the oceans in search of themselves. Would welcome any comments.",8,0,0,9 July 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Bland, Boring, I was zoning out at times
","Mr. and Mrs Smith- how many ways can you spell b-o-r-i-n-g? This movie has one major flaw. It should have been made 'R' instead of 'PG-13'. Why they watered it down, I'll never understand. By the movie poster (yes, I fell for the poster like millions of other American males) I thought the movie would be sexy, sophisticated and sublime, perhaps in the line of Bourne Identity or James Bond. Instead it was watered, bland, and silly. I don't want to see Pitt and Jolie in comedy, OK? I want lust, bullets, action. I liked both of them in other movies and thought their pairing would be dynamite. Alas, it was like weak tea. And why do movies where the co-stars fall in love with one another tend to fail? It's a shame. Save your money unless you just want to stare at Angelina Jolie.",3,0,2,31 December 2005
The Pursuit of Happyness," bummer, man, depressing storyline
","This is not the type of movie we normally go see. But my daughter is a school teacher and majored in Elementary Education. So we went as a family because she wanted to see it. It was strange, the 3 of us all got widely different views of the movie. My husband hated it, he said it was 95% depressing and 5% happy. And he said there were no peaks or lows like most stories you see. It was just flat line depressing all the way. He said he wouldn't watch it again if it was free. I almost got up and went to the lobby at the last 20 minutes. The depression of the whole thing just weighed so heavily on my mind. I want to go to movies to enjoy escapism. I work in a large US city where there are many homeless people, so, yes, I see them 5 days a week. My daughter liked it and found it inspiring. It did open a line of dialogue between us that was fun. She didn't know I sold blood once for money while in the military. And she didn't know I had spent the night once in a homeless shelter in Chicago, also while in the military.",1,7,20,8 January 2007
