E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A Genuine Masterpiece
","This is truly a movie that never gets old,but instead gets better each and everytime one watches it. When I first saw this film I was around four and never really understood it fully. All I knew was that it was about an alien that wanted to go home. When I watch it now I catch the other unique details in the movie. For example, John Williams terrific score, amazing directing techniques by Steven, symbolism, and unbelievable acting. I think it is safe to say that this is the # 1 film I have seen to this date simply because it never gets old. My son saw this movie and I found out that he is more mature then I was at his age (he is 4 by the way). He told me how we are watching in 'et vision'!He was right! We are watching from his point of view and elliots also.I was impressed when he said that....who knows, he might become a director some day! Just to sum up with a final statement: They dont make movies like they used to these days!!( example is any of Tom Greenes movies...take a pick!)",Null,0,0,20 July 2001
