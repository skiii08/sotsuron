The Blair Witch Project," think about it.....
",No scoring.... No fancy camera angles.... this is a great film... although I am alone in the house.... and it is getting dark.....But actually waiting to see how hollywood mucks this up and spends 20 million trying to imitate imitate it....hey wait a second.... did you hear something..No? well it must be a cat or somethingAnyways... the film itself... with its minamilst style... and strong emotions... starts well ends well... we are not beaten over the head reminding us what is happening.... the films moves along and lets us feel the moment....No seriously... theres something out there.... My God.... I wonde.... WHAT IS THAT.... ITS  COMMIN,9,1,1,31 July 1999
The Thin Red Line," my god save me
","the words overblown, egotistical, disjointed, and farce come leaping to my mind... Not only was this not one of the all time classics ever made... this can be ranked as one of the poorest movies ever made.  You wonder if the filmmakers actually see the world as a place that the feel of silence can be given through a musical score... HORRIBLE HORRIBLE FILM!",1,1,5,5 August 1999
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Coen brothers... need we say more
","Since it would be unfair to rate this movie against other writer/directors works, rating it on the coen brother scale I would say this scores a definite nine.  While it might not quite measure up to Raising Arizona.. It is definitely a one of there shining stars. Intellectually stimulating, witty (complete with two obvious punch line jokes to remind you where you are), spiritual, and visually a work of art.  It ain't no wrestling movie....",9,0,0,25 March 2001
