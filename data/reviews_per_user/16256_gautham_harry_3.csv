Insidious: Chapter 2," Wasn't that scary! But a very well extended sequel
","For obvious reasons, Insidious: Chapter 2 is not really a silly cash grab, it definitely got some intention behind it and in addition, a whole bunch of things to extend. So, if you're expecting a complete terrifying experience in the vein of its prequel, this may not entertain you.*Spoilers* The movie opens in the year 1986, where the young Josh is under some kinda uncanny observation and after few bizarre manifestations Elise asserts that Josh is able to see things and people which belong to another astral world and later hypnotizes him to forget everything. Returning back to the present situation where chapter one had originally barred, Reine (Rose Bryne) still experiences some kinda peculiar sounds and evil spirits wandering around. Josh (Patrick Wilson) is obviously been possessed by something and turns into an adversary to his own family.What I really liked about the movie? perceptibly the story and the intent in extending the movie which I didn't really felt stupid while watching, clearly it was unnecessary but it dealt with something new and novel and did a great job in narrating the scenes which are co-related to it's prequel.In line with my issues about the movie, the overall plot was mystifying, it tried to answer many questions which made the movie a little unclear. And the terrifying factor was a bit let down, the demons were not that petrifying when compared with the dude in red paint in chapter one.Indeed, credits to James Wan and Leigh Whannel for shaping up the sequel really well, the sound effects and the set designs were really well used and I should really appreciate James Wan for making the movie with decent budget and with genuine scares which didn't seek for any CGI help.Nevertheless, Insidious: Chapter 2 is a well extended sequel with few creepy jump scares. I've definitely got few issues with it, but it didn't bother me because of it's intent. I certainly recommend you to go check it out only in theatres, if you're totally aware of what happened in the prequel. My Rating - 3/5Vedict-- Wasn't that scary! But a very well extended sequel",7,0,1,17 November 2013
Life of Pi," Visually stunning..slow screenplay
","Visually, this movie is a knockout. Scene after scene produces audible gasps as we see images we never thought possible. The colors just pop off the screen, the various animals shown are incredibly realistic, and the views of sky and sea are just phenomenal. Even if there was no plot whatsoever, you should see it just for the visuals.There is a plot, of course. A boy/young man is stranded on a lifeboat and is forced to survive for endless days through unbelievable hardships. And if that alone were the plot, I'd be content, but the framework around the shipwreck story claims something more, that this story says something about the human condition, about God and man, about sin and salvation, about how we should live our lives. My problem quite frankly is that I just did not see the connection. Maybe I need it told more directly, I certainly have a low tolerance for ambiguity. So if you can live with agonizingly uncertain outcomes, where you question everything you have just seen, then you will love this. But if you like things told to you clearly, you may walk away a bit puzzled, as I did.But regardless, this movie redefines the word 'beautiful.' I was just amazed to see the many, many moods of the ocean as it is portrayed, in fact it becomes one of the primary characters as it is sometimes benevolent, sometimes treacherous; calm or stormy; gray or overflowing with color; etc.i watched it in Dolby Atmos which was amazing!Overall a good movie with beautiful visuals :)screen play could have been much more faster. many felt a bit bored inbetween.",7,2,6,13 December 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," Best Animated Movie Of Recent Times
","Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph, the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph , the villain in the 'Fix-it Felix' arcade game, who decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy.I had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the premise to this sounded really cool and clever â€“ a love letter to video games. I really love the voice cast.So, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a fun animated movie for all ages, and better than All the recent animated movies so far.I must say it does look pretty darn good in 3D. The animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.The characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic, etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever. It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the main character's goal become a success? And so forth.It's a classic no doubt, and Wreck-it Ralph will be one of those movies on my 'favorites' shelf for decades to come. The true triumph? Wreck-it Ralph feels like that classic game that has been a part of my childhood ever since I can remember; the type of classic where you throw hundreds of quarters away and you honestly just don't care, because it is just that good. Highly recommended, and a 10 out of 10 for me, as I expect this will be my short list of favorite movies for years to come",10,1,3,15 November 2012
