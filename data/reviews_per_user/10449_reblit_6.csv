Ghost," 'I Love You,' 'Ditto'
","This movie makes you believe that there are love affairs that last beyond death. Patrick Swayze's character, handsome, rugged, honorable is murdered in what seems like a random mugging. But it isn't and Patrick feels the need to stay around and find out what or who is behind his killing. When he starts to find out things, he has to tell Demi Moore's character and that is where Whoopi's character comes in - she is a medium and she hears Patrick. There is a sensual chemistry between the two main characters, and there loss of one another is very heart wrenching. Whoopi adds some lightness to an otherwise sad story It is a chick flick for sure, but its done well and it leaves you feeling sad and uplifted at the same time. It is worth a watch. Not really appropriate for small children.",7,3,5,2 April 2005
Finding Neverland," Beautiful Story, portrayed beautifully!
","This is a story about childhood and growing up to fast. This is a story about love, falling out of and falling into love. This is a poignant story about playing pretend and wanting to believe hard enough and long enough to make it come true! Johnny Depp is amazing! In 1991 I watched 'Edward Scissorshands' with my children (8 & 9). At the time I thought the actor that played Edward (Johnny Depp) was a great character actor. I had never seen Johnny Depp in anything before that. Shortly after that publicity about Johnny Depp caused me to 'write him off', I decided I did not want to support his behavior by paying to watch his work. In May of this year (2005) I went to Blockbuster to pick up a movie. I chose 'Finding Neverland' based solely on the case picture. After the movie had ended and I had stopped sobbing I wondered, 'Who is that actor?' When I read 'Johnny Depp' I said out loud to no one in particular - NO WAY! I'm drawn to find other Johnny Depp movies - see what he has done in his career.",10,2,2,21 September 2005
The Notebook," Beautiful tribute to love
","'The Notebook' is a story of love, specifically of the Love between Noah (played by Ryan Gosling and James Garner)and Allie (played by Rachel McAdams and Gina Rowlands).This movies should touch everyone's heart that watches it. There is not a person that hasn't felt drawn back toward a first love, nor is there a person who doesn't wish for and look for a love that will last a lifetime - someone to be passionate with, to laugh with, to argue with, to be with when things are difficult and to grow old with.This movie is a tribute to a love that surpasses all other loves. This is a beautiful movie and - even with some sexual scenes, is suitable for all audiences that are old enough to understand love between a man and a woman.",10,3,4,2 April 2005
Dirty Dancing," The Movie Draws You In - and Back to 1963
","I have watched this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and each time I watch it I am drawn into the movie and back to 1963! The Movie takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time I watch it.I think the important thing to say here is I was 15 in 1963 and I can remember 'before President Kennedy was shot and before the Beetles came.' I can feel myself saying something like, 'I carried a watermelon.' and then realizing just how stupid that was! Jennifer Grey plays Frances 'Baby' Houseman in Dirty Dancing. Baby is going to start college in the Fall. She goes to Kellerman's for vacation with her family (mom, Dad and sister Lisa).One of the staff dancers, Penny (played by Cynthia Rhodes) gets pregnant by another staff person (one of the college boys played by Max Cantor) and has a chance to get an abortion but it is on a night that her and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) are scheduled to dance at a nearby hotel.Thus, the need for a fill-in dancer for Penny. Johnny is persuaded by Penny and his cousin Billy (Neal Jones) that he can teach Baby to do the dance in time for the show. Baby learning the dance steps with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes!Baby's father (Doctor Jake Houseman played by Jerry Orbach) comes to Penny's rescue when the abortion is done wrong. Dirty Dancing brought back to me this time in history when girls got pregnant and had abortions in back rooms by butchers. Around this time (1963) many girls actually died from this type of abortion - but there were not many choices for a girl then.Lonnie Price plays a great conceited grandson (Neil Kellerman) to Jack Weston's Max Kellerman. Jane Brucker does a great job as Baby's annoying sister Lisa Houseman.The music is great and the dancing is wonderful! The 'dirty dancers' are absolutely wonderful and very sexy - I can feel Baby's astonishment when she first sees them dancing and says, 'Where'd they learn to do that?'.Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze are just perfect together in their respective roles. Patrick's song, 'She's Like The Wind' brings tears to my eyes each time I hear/watch it in this movie.The movie ends on an up note, but leaves you wanting to know what happens next in Baby's and Johnny's lives. Dirty Dancing gives something new each time it is watched - It mesmerizes the watcher with nostalgia, a feeling of wanting it to be 1963 again.",10,0,0,28 March 2005
Before Sunset," Boring Personal Conversation
",I felt like an intruder on a very very long and very boring personal conversation. Neither Ethan Hawke (Jesse) nor Julie Delpy (Celine)were able to portray any real interest in their own conversation let alone bring the conversation alive and draw the viewer into their lives. These two young people who had met 6 years earlier in a 'passonate' fleeting moment (The subject of an earlier film)seemed intent on destroying any pleasant memories that they had each carried of the other! This was the longest stupidest movie I believe I have ever watched! The use of brief 'flash-backs' from the movie filmed in 1995 was unique and interesting because the characters had changed (matured in appearance) but not unrecognizably so. The Movie set was very nice (maybe it was really Paris?). But the streets of Paris and the 'flash-back' technique could be put to much better use elsewhere! The Movie contained a lot of unnecessarily nasty language - maybe in an attempt to make the conversation provocative? Don't waste you time watching this movie!,1,11,32,8 April 2005
Donnie Darko," Vivid imagery, absorbing yet disturbing
","Donnie Darko is an absorbing movie that captures your attention and doesn't let go until the movie ends  in fact it holds on much longer than that! My vote of five (5) only indicates that I would not choose this movie for entertainment purposes  but the movie is probably an excellent movie for this genre. In fact, when the movie was over I was left with a feeling of not really knowing what was part of Donnie's visions and what was the reality of the movie. The movie was full of imagery that left me with a disturbing feeling and probably caused me to have the nightmare I had the night following watching the movie. Donnie Darko is played by Jake Gyllenhaal who does a good job of portraying a teenager who is searching for answers and is disturbed by what is happening to him. Beth Grant play Kitty Farmer an absolute disgustingly over-righteous teacher who has been drawn into a simplistic answer for life's problems being pushed by the infomercial type snake-oil salesman Jim Cunningham played pretty well by Patrick Swayze. Drew Barrymore plays Karen Pomeroy, a teacher that is trying to challenge her students to think about the meaning of things, methods which lead Kitty Farmer to call for the ban on some books.",5,1,3,13 April 2005
