It," One of the greatest horror movies of all time.
","I am a huge horror buff. So I have seen countless of good and bad horror films. Ranging from movies like The Visit to Halloween to Alien. All of these movies where scary in their own way, but none of them had ever kept me scared the entire time... until IT.IT is one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Which is really surprising for a horror movie. This movie captures everything that made the book great. The subtle messages about what evil is, the terror of IT and most importantly the heart of the characters. IT is one of the greatest horror films of all time and I am really looking forward to chapter 2Remember... if you come with me... you'll float too.",10,0,2,3 May 2018
Alien vs. Predator," You have to accept the film for what it is
","If you're going to watch this film you cant walk in expecting a serious film. Well maybe serious is the wrong word, but you have to be in on the joke and open minded.The sole purpose of this film is to watch the alien and the predator just go at it. If you are expecting that, you won't be disappointed. While the lack of gore does take away from some of the scenes it's all in all a fun flick. Especially if you're an alien and/or predator fan.",7,1,1,25 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I'm getting really sick of all the hate on this movie.
","Have you ever watched an amazing movie and seen so many negative reviews for it that it actually made you angry? That has been my experience for this movie every day. People need to stop whining and accept that just because this movie is different doesn't mean it's badI, like many Star Wars fans, went into this movie with expectations. High ones at that. I expected some twist like obi wan kenobi was Rey's grandfather and for Luke to still stay true to the Jedi code. What I got was something entirely different and even better. Luke has to go through his own character arch and rey's parents were nobodies. Giving her the freedom to be an original character. A lot of bold choices were made by Rian Johnson in this movie and all of them worked extremely well. (Forgive me for not going into specifics. I'm trying to keep this as spoiler free as possible.) As for those negative reviews, I don't even think those reviews are from Star Wars fans. I think that one guy gave this movie a one star and a ton of haters just joined the bandwagon. Seriously, people. This is one of the greatest Star Wars movies of all time and I am done letting it revive all this hate.So I hope people take this review to heart and learn to appreciate the last Jedi for what it is: revolutionary.",9,5,35,24 April 2018
