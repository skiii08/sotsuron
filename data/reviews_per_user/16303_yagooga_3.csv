A Quiet Place," A whole new level of the apocalyptic movies
","This movie is brilliant and very entertaining , John Krasinski done a great job directing and acting in this movie , despite a very little dialogues in the movie But the looks between the characters and face expression was more than enough to live the situation with the character . Also Emily Blunt's acting was sooo great , Noah Jupe was amazing and i think he has a great bright future in acting and Millicent Simmonds's acting (the deaf actress) was exceptional . 
I'm very excited to see a sequal .",10,2,6,28 July 2018
