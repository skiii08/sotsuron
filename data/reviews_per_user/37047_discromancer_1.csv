Sucker Punch," waste of time
","I've expected so much and got this! If the director was a newcomer I wouldn't mind ,but in search of good movies well known directors such Zack Snyder giving us this! After so many good written stories , they stick to some time-wasting crap! In the era of action heroes ,we don't need new ones :bunch of girlie's kicking zombie-Nazis ass! Though the movie is GOOD directed,there are beautiful scenes,the pictures are great and Zack did a good and hard job,but could have spared it! Im am really in search of good new stories which are really good told and well directed,which was not the case here! In general I gave it a 5 star,due to my expectation which turned out as a failure, but I will give Zack another chance in the future. Since this my first review I wanted to help someone by preventing watching this and such movies!",5,0,2,28 October 2011
