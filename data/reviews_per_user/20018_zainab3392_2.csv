The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Have a Saturday night date? Watch this.
","So honestly, here's the thing...Perks of being a wallflower is catered to a very specific group of people: teenagers. Watching this film made me feel like I was 15. That itself, is a good thing and a bad one. If you're in the mood for an intense, nerve-wrecking film don't even bother watching this. But, if you want a nice evening with your buttered popcorn and an amazing sound track in the background, go for it! The story line did not blow me away, but the acting, I must say was brilliant. My favourite actor in the movie would have to be Ezna Miller, followed closely by Emma Watson. One would find oneself to be too busy appreciating just how gorgeous she looks and not have to pay too much attention to her acting. All in all, a mediocre story line, with great fresh faces and a very endearing soundtrack! This is the movie to watch if you're in on a Saturday night and want to spend some quality time with your date or simply if you're looking for a nice romance/drama to make your day :)",6,1,2,18 January 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," It's all in the presentation!
","I saw this film shortly after watching Perks of Being a Wallflower and Silver Lining's Playbook. The other two movies were much hyped about (unnecessarily so, if I may add). Moonrise Kingdom, on the other hand, has to be one of the most under-rated movies ever. With a very interesting cast, a unique soundtrack and a story line that epitomizes simplicity, Moonrise Kingdom presents 'young romance' like never presented before. What stood out for me the most, was the dialogue of the movie. One would expect normal lovers to converse in flowery confessions. Haunting, uncomfortable and dark: these are the words I would use to describe the conversations between the two leads of the movie. Despite the darkness of the movie, it was not short on humor. All in all, this movie has everything that a good movie should! Highly recommended to any movie fanatic. You're sure to enjoy it :)",8,1,2,2 February 2013
