Iron Man 3," Made me want to watch Magnum P.I.
","I saw Iron Man 3 as part of the Iron Man Marathon. I have never been to a preview of this type of film where it got no applause at the end. The Star Trek preview did, The Thor preview did. The 1st 2 Iron Man movies did, as well as the Avengers movie...just not IM3. The was a bit of applause about 3 minutes before the end on behalf of a minor but beloved character...and the after-credit tag got some laughter. RDJ, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle & Paul Bettany were, as always, deft with the material given to them. The guest actors were fine. Major KUDOS to young Ty Simpkins...I know they can't really bring his character back, but I loved him and Stark together. (This is the edit: I think the kid and RDJ had a real chemistry together. This does not mean I necessarily approved of some of the 'just to prove a plot point' aspects of the dialog or some of the illogics of the plot that happened during their scenes together.)I think Shane Black was a poor choice for director (and writer). I never got the feeling that he embraced that he was directing (and writing) Iron Man. It felt (ESPECIALLY the end credits) that he wanted to be directing his favorite cop show & this is what he could get. Some changes to the characters were made at the end which were both awful & rushed through.Am I glad I saw it on the big screen...sure. Am I glad I saw it as part of the marathon (and, btw, bravo to AMC Theatres for the way they organized and handled the marathon)...absolutely. But, if it were to be included in an upcoming marathon, I would probably go out to dinner during it.",6,6,12,3 May 2013
