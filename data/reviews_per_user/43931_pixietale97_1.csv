The Avengers," The Avengers couldn't have Avenged Earth any better!
","Saw that movie only a week or two it came out, waiting for my friend to go to the mall with, and it was- is - amazing! I was never a superhero fan, but The Avengers blew me away, with Black Widows kick- butt moves, Tonys constant sarcasm, and -Spoiler alert, if you haven't seen the movie, don't go on- Thor and Captain America little battle over who understands 21st century phrases, it's entirely amazing! If you take all that away, you still have the plot line and action! Honestly, if you haven't, I really recommend you to see this movie when it comes out. If you liked the Avengers before they hit the big screen, you're gonna go hay wire now.",10,3,8,16 September 2012
