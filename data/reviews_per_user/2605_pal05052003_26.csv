10 Cloverfield Lane," A young lady finds herself in an underground house with a mentally unstable 'savior' who claims that the air outside had been contaminated.
","10 Cloverfield Lane is a lean movie that is packed with tension throughout. It does not dwell on over dramatizing the character's situation but manages to keeps a very tense atmosphere throughout the movie. John Goodman's performance as Howard is excellent as he is both menacing but can make the audience sympathize with him. He manages to exert a sense of firm authority that would make anyone fall in line in real life. The cinematography helps too. It creates a claustrophobic atmosphere and gives a sense of helplessness. This makes it easy to also empathize Mary Elizabeth Winstead's situation. Throughout the movie, I could feel the awkwardness, the tension and the menace throughout the atmosphere without the use of gore. This is a very clever psychological horror movie with a great twist at the end. (But given the title has a reference to Cloverfield, it should not be much of a twist, however, it still packs great surprise and tension.) The finale is rather open ended, you can see it as either hopeful or bleak. In short, this is an amazing movie and I wish Hollywood could make more movies like that.",8,5,7,13 August 2016
The Equalizer," A retired agent seeking to right the wrongs on the innocent has to face off with a ruthless henchman sent by the Russian mafia.
","Any action movie with Denzel Washington is good nowadays, but his one stands out. The tone and mood is grim and resembles that of the Bourne series. Even the background music reminds me of the Bourne series. However, it may hint of the Bourne series, it is definitely not a rip-off. Washington's McCall is a world-weary former agent who still hinted through the books he reads. Seeing a young girl (Chloe Moretz) brutalized by a crime boss, he ends up wreaking revenge and finally takes on the whole Russian mob. As a conflicted hero who has to choose between living a quiet life and accepting his roots as a killer, Washington is perfect for the role. His ruggedness, and charisma makes him believable as both a nice guy who can kill. Chloe Moretz, once again, reminds us how talented she is. In all her roles, she is a totally different personality. I even forgot that she used to be Hit Girl in Kick Ass, or Carrie White. Moretz's performance as a hooker with child-like innocence is enough to make anyone feel like wanting to help. Thus, it is easy to believe why Washington's character spurred to action. As for another great performance in the movie, Marton Csokas plays the henchman out to get Washington's McCall. Csokas is the perfect foil. He is intelligent, and charismatic, but is ruthless and amoral. He shines in this movie. In fact, he is much scarier than when he played a Treadstone assassin in the Bourne Supremacy, and that says a lot. Another great thing about the movie is the soundtrack. It fits the narrative and tone perfectly. All in all, a great action thriller to enjoy.",8,2,5,3 February 2015
Train to Busan," A group of people has to survive a train full of zombies.
","Koreans are good at making horror, and this zombie movie attempt shows how skillful they are. You have fast-running zombies, blood spattering, and selfish people. The film delivers shock value, and decent drama along the way. It feels like World War Z without CGI zombies piling on each other. Being set on a train, the plot is also similar to Snowpiercer, another train horror movie. (what is this obsession with trains, or is it the only place in Korea where the space is cramped?)The acting is decent, and the casts are pretty average-looking; with the exception of the lead actor, which makes the story more credible. The director did not focus too much on morality issues like the Walking Dead, but sets up new problems for the characters to face at different stages of the movie. This makes the plot move quickly and smoothly. The ending was rather conventional, but I guess no one hates a happy ending.",8,2,5,4 September 2016
Captain Marvel," A Marvel action spectacle that delivers
","Despite the hype about its anti-male stance, and feminist message, Captain Marvel is a regular superhero movie that delivers on action, spectacle, and performances. The battle scenes are great, and the train fight scene from the trailer does not disappoint. I used to think that DC is better at spectacle than Marvel, but the spectacle, especially when Brie Larson finally becomes Captain Marvel, is much better. I like to see heroes fight using actual powers than martial arts, and Captain Marvel delivers in spades. The supporting cast was strong, and I especially liked Samuel L Jackson, who plays a more innocent version of Nick Fury. Jude Law is great, and so is Annette Benning. But the one who truly steals the show is the cat named Goose. He is so adorable, he steals all the scenes. He even has a few tricks on his sleeve too. Ben Mendelsohn's Talos elevates the material too. However, the story itself seems like a mixture of The Bourne Identity, Top Gun, a random buddy-cop movie, and Star Wars. The visuals seem like a recycling of set pieces from Thor, and the Guardians of the Galaxy. I admit that Brie Larson's Captain Marvel seems a bit stale, but she is not given much material. And we do see that Captain Marvel's subtly human side, but her emotions truly show when she is with Jude Law. In fact, Larson should be credited for being able to have chemistry with everyone onscreen; especially Samuel L Jackson. Though she has great moments with Jude Law, and Annette Benning. However, I feel more could be done about the character. I also believe that Djimon Honsou, and Gemma Chan were really underused. Honsou never gets to display his full potential as an actor like in his breakout role Blood Diamond. The same can be said for Gemma Chan, whose captivating performance in Crazy Rich Asians is the best part of the movie. However, despite these flaws, Captain Marvel is a true delight to watch.",7,0,2,10 March 2019
Aquaman," Arthur Curry is called upon to save the land-dwelling races from the impending invasion from the underwanter kingdoms.
","I was always a DCEU fan and actually enjoyed Batman V Superman, and Justice League, so I had high expectations for Aquaman. After watching it, I can say I was fully entertained. DC movies were always great on spectacle, and this was no exception. In even managed to create a new world that could be enough to make Aquaman a franchise in its own right. With James Wan at the helm, this movie does not feel like a DC movie. It is not moody, nor mopey and had lots of fun. The sea creatures were great, and the underwater world was breathtaking. Jason Momoa proved he could carry a movie. Despite his hulking presence, and badass look, Momoa's Aquaman is a quite a character. He is charming, witty, and persevering. But he is not broody like Batman or Superman, nor is he a doe-eyed idealist as Wonder Woman during WWI. He is a relatable character who just happens to have superpowers. Besides Momoa, Patrick Wilson was excellent as a villain. Unlike previous DC villains, he is interesting, and proves a worthy nemesis to Momoa's Aquaman. Though his performance is not as compelling as Michael B Jordan's Killmonger, we can still see understand his character's motive. As for other supporting casts, Dolph Lundgren stole the show. He chews every scenery he is in. That is not to say Amber Heard, and Willem Defoe were terrible, but I just enjoyed Lundgren more. In the end, Aquaman is a superhero movie done right, and does not aim to be Oscar material. A great piece of fun entertainment!",8,1,3,24 December 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor has to prevent Ragnarok; the end of Asgardian world but has to face the powerful Hela, Goddess of Death
","This is brilliant superhero movie. It has a perfect combination of humor, action, and thrills. The visual were excellent and soundtrack keeps the pulses pumping. Chris Hemsworth really shines in this movie and for once you can actually see Thor as a formidable superhero. Cate Blanchett plays Thor's nemesis and is the perfect villain. She literally kills in the movie, and we can see her motivation and feel her anger. But that is to be expected for an actress of Blanchett's caliber. What is astounding is that she actually delivers in spades. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk also gets to shine in this movie, and for once he seems an integral character to the movie, not just a side character. We even see Idris Elba's Heimdall get some action too. Tom Hiddleston's Loki is still intriguing, and has brilliant chemistry with Hemsworth's Thor; as always. In short, this is one movie where all important characters get to shine and showcase their awesomeness. The movie also showcases one of the best, if not the best superhero smackdowns in cinema: Thor vs Hulk. The pacing and storytelling is brilliant and continuously keeps the audience guessing what will happen next. In other words, Thor: Ragnarok is a superhero movie made correctly.",9,1,6,3 November 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America returns in this sequel where he is pit with a mysterious organization that has infiltrated Shield and sets its eyes on world domination.
","I could care less about Captain America, but given the positive reviews from my friends, and IMDb, I decided to give it a try. In fact, it has a good story, and great action. It seems that Hollywood is learning how to make good fight choreography nowadays. Of course the movie's main strength is in the action and spectacle. However, the conspiracy part is well played. It provides tension, and some room for guessing. However, Robert Redford seemed suspicious too early in the movie, and Samuel L. Jackson's character was underplayed. It also helps that there is a great villain: the Winter Soldier, who always seems to have a slight advantage over Captain America. Despite my good opinion on this movie, I am not sure I want to see Captain America 3. For that, I am counting on Marvel to surprise me again.",Null,0,0,6 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Epic trailer, and soundtrack, but average story
","I was never a fan of the Star Wars saga, but the brilliant trailer and John Williams' score made it look truly epic. Sure there were many spectacular battles, and action, but plotwise the story seemed average. I appreciate the cameos from the original characters, but that is not enough to lift the movie. Rey's relationship with Kylo Ren was one of the most distracting moments for me in the previous installment and I dreaded having to see it play out here. Fortunately, their relationship/conflict was bearable but failed to provide any emotional anchor to the story. Daisy Ridley's Rey does not have much but to frown and scream; though she does great action scenes. John Boyega's Finn is pretty useless too, and I feel they could have used him better in the story. The only great thing about The Rise of Skywalker is John William's theme playing during the spectacularly explosive space battles. That almost makes up for the admission price. But if you are looking for an emotional send off, none here.",5,5,8,6 January 2020
Bird Box," Tense till the end
","When I saw the title of Bird Box I did not know what to expect, except that it starred Sandra Bullock. But with all the hype and memes I decided to give the movie a try. I was even more enticed when I saw Sarah Paulson in it too. In the end, I am fully satisfied. The movie dragged a bit, but there was always a feeling of dread lingering throughout the movie. Most of the horror is suggested and it really works. Thanks to Sandra Bullock's performances, you care for her character and worry all the time. The movie boasts appearances of interesting actors too such as B D Wong, John Malkovich, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and Sarah Paulson. They all have juicy parts to play, and I love every scene they are in. In the end, the movie feels like A Quiet Place, but much more stretched out. The ending should be satisfying but we can't help but feel a sense of dread lingering on. In other words, I enjoyed it a lot. The movie has truly terrifying and tense moments, and does not let up till the end. I am still feeling tense now.",8,1,3,30 December 2018
Justice League," Batman and Wonder Woman recruit several other superheroes to fight a new threat to the Earth after the death of Superman
","A very light, and entertaining movie indeed. The CGI and lighting may be distracting at times, but these flaws do not take away much from the movie. Ezra Miller's Flash was the comic relief, Jason Momoa's Aquaman was the tough guy, while Ray Fisher's Cyborg provided the tragic part. In this installment, Ben Affleck's Batman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman are the key characters and they provide a motive for the story. The only flaw to the movie is that although every hero is interesting, we do not get time to be too invested in them. However, this flaw is compensated by the numerous fight scenes. One interesting battle the the underwater fight scene featuring Aquaman (no spoilers here; since we are talking about Aquaman there is bound to be a water fighting scene). In fact, this movie focuses on the heroes, and when the team gets together, that is where all the cool action starts. The pacing may seem uneven, and the movie felt a bit short but you will leave the theater feeling great. Highly recommended for anyone needing light superhero fun.",7,3,4,19 November 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Newt Scamander loses a few magical creatures while on a trip to New York and has to recover them before exposing all wizardry to the public.
","The best thing about the movie is the creatures, and the world of these fantastic creatures. The photography was excellent in capturing the magic and awe of the world of magic. This is backed up by Eddie Redmayne's brilliant performance as the awkward but kind Newt Scamander. Co-starring alongside Redmayne is Dan Fogler, who seems more like a Kevin James lookalike. He is both charming, and funny. Another strong point is the cameos by Johnny Depp, and an unrecognizable Ron Perlman as Gnarlak. The bad part of the movie was the story-telling. It seems like two different stories set in the same world. The tones are completely different. One story focuses on Newt and his creatures, which is more like a children's adventure story. The other story, centering more on Farrell's character is darker and follow's the tone of the Carrie remake. When the two stories merged, it seemed forced. I guess Yates is brilliant in focusing on one story, like he did in the Harry Potter movies than he is at telling intricate plots. The pacing was a problem too, as it seemed to proceed too slowly, especially the one focusing on Ezra Miller's character. Miller's character is wasted, and despite having little screen time, you can't feel a sense of tragedy for his character at the end. John Voight was unnecessary, and provided no new stakes to the story. However, Harry Potter fans will probably enjoy this movie because is opens a new world to the Harry Potter universe. For non-Harry Potter fans like myself, I am just mildly entertained. Let's see if the sequel is better.",7,0,2,23 November 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," A superhero movie that really makes you fear for the lives of superheroes
","Avengers: Infinity War manages to fix and upgrade superhero movies on many levels. First, it manages to deliver a truly intimidating villain with a good motivation. Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is an upgrade of great Marvel villains such as Killmonger, who is human, and Hela, who is a goddess. Brolin's delivery is perfect, his voice is calm but intimidating and his performance makes you actually root for him. P.s. he gets to manhandle some of the most powerful Avengers. Second, Infinity War manages to raise the stakes like never before. Even Thanos' henchmen are formidable fighters and can take on any Avenger any time. Never before have I really feared for the lives of a superhero in a superhero movie. Third, all characters have enough screen time to allow them to shine and to remind you why they are heroes. Unfortunately, Black Widow does not get much material to work with, but she has a kickass fight in the end, so I am cool. Finally, despite the destruction, the movie manages to lighten the mood periodically so it does not get too depressing. The stirring musical score by Alan Silvestri is so well integrated to the movie that manages to rouse you without you noticing it. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is probably the only movie where you really fear for all the heroes, but somehow also root for the villain.",10,31,70,29 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Funny, nostalgia-filled, and violent
","To sum up Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood, it is funny, nostalgia-filled and violent. The movie transports us to the 1960s Hollywood, where Leonardo di Caprio's Rick Dalton struggles with the changing times and is supported by his stunt double/pal (played by Brad Pitt) Cliff Booth. The color, and vibes is very 1960s, and you could feel the positivity and innocence of that era. This innocence is best embodied by Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate. The movie is filled with fun cameos such as Al Pacino, Kurt Russells, Tarantino regular Zoe Bell. There is also a very captivating performance by Julia Butters as a young Method actress, who manages to go toe-to-toe with the talented di Caprio. The pacing is a bit slow and leisurely, and some scenes could be cut out, but all the performances of the stellar ensemble are in fact stellar (funny that these stellar performances are played by stars playing stars). There are some really tense senses, sprinkled with humor, and a violent conclusion. It is a movie to experience and breeze through. For that quality alone, it is worth a watch. And of course Leo and Brad are excellent!",7,2,3,3 September 2019
Gone Girl," A man is accused of murdering his own wife and is put through the media spotlight, making the situation a lot worse for him.
","This movie is really tense. At first it seemed slow but things get more interesting as the plot thickens. I cannot imagine a better person to play the role of Amy, the disappearing wife, than Rosamund Pike. She definitely nailed it. As for Ben Affleck, his expression really fits the movie. He looks clueless, and is helpless with the situation. The other characters were great too. Carrie Coon, who played Affleck's sister, was also great. She helps highlight the plight of Affleck's character, and for a moment, also helped highlight his flaws. It is quite refreshing to see the good guys be totally helpless till the end of a movie that is not a horror movie. To be honest, the situation in the movie is almost like a horror movie for marriage, where the moral is: choose the right person or you will be stuck. p.s. though I rated this movie high, I don't think I will want to re-watch it. It is like the Saw series, enjoyable in the first watch but can't stomach another one. So if you want to enjoy it, make sure you have gotten rid of all possible annoyances.",8,0,2,3 October 2015
A Quiet Place," Raised the bar for modern horror
","I am very glad to have seen this movie on the big screen and am blown away with the experience. The direction is perfect. The mood and the tone was set from the very beginning. The premise is simple but very well-executed. It begins with slow-burning tension to set up the mood and understand the characters and the stakes. Then it goes full-on nail-biting intensity until the very final scene. Kudos goes to the excellent performances of all the cast. Despite having very little dialogue, a lot of emotions are expressed through the characters: the tension, frustration, sorrow, and fear. Emily Blunt was excellent, and so were the child-actors, but the stand-out performance for me is John Kransinski's role as the father. This is a clear departure from his comic roles but manages to deliver will full impact. The true horror lay in the anticipation of what horrors would come, and Krasinski as a director manages to remind us very effectively of all the potential dangers that can happen to our protagonists. The gore and jump scares work very well. In fact, there are no empty jump scares, and each jump scare helps build tension as the story proceeds. So effective was the execution of the story that I believe this movie has raised the bar for modern horror.",10,3,8,9 April 2018
Beauty and the Beast," A village girl is imprisoned in a castle with a beast and fall in love
","I never expected much from a live action remake of a cartoon classic, so I had low expectations. I did not care about the hype either. The only interesting thing about the movie is the use of 3D. Apart from that, the story is not new, it is just a conversion of the animated version to live action. The musical numbers were inferior to the original. The only good part of the movie is Luke Evan's role as Gaston. The minute I learned he was cast as Gatson, I knew he would be wonderful. In fact, his character was the most interesting in the movie. Emma Watson was okay, but fails to exude her 'Hermione' in Belle. The cast of talented actors did not help elevate the story much. Ian McKellen, and Emma Thompson are wasted. The CGI was terrible too. The Beast effects was very unrealistic and distracting. All in all, the only reason to enjoy this movie is because of the 3D, Luke Evans, and nostalgia. It would be a good movie for kids who have not seen the original animation.",6,2,9,19 March 2017
Sicario," An police officer gets involved in an escalating war against drugs
","A slow-burning thriller with several unsettling moments, and great acting. Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and Benicio Del Toro, all do a great job. This movie explores the war on drugs, and the necessary evils used to stop evil. Emily Blunt plays a police officer who volunteers to fight drugs, but witnesses atrocities and illegal practices from her team. Josh Brolin is brilliant in his role, and you don't really know whether he is the good guy or the bad guy. Del Toro is the most enigmatic, and in the end, his true motives are revealed. The directing is good. The shooting scenes all have tension building up. The deaths makes you feel rattled, rather than cheer for the dead bad guys. The use of vast empty desert landscape shot from above gives the feeling of both peace, and awe. This contrasts with the actual situation on the ground, which is rife with violence. In short, this is a dense movie, which forces you to watch and think. It does not make you feel good in the end.",6,1,2,20 March 2016
The Descent," A group of cave explorers are trapped in a cave full of strange predators and have to escape.
","I was not expecting much but this movie really surprised me. The best part was the setting. It seemed so real, and no CGI. It starts like many horror movies: the protagonist has a tragedy she wants to get over, and that tragedy influences the outcome of the story. However, in this movie, all the characters are strong independent women who can definitely take care of themselves in our civilized world. Yet even for them, the cave proves too much. I like the fact that the director did not use the loud noise to show a scary moment. The atmosphere and soundtrack makes the movie a tense thriller. In fact, this could be a very suspenseful movie without the monster, but the monster was foreshadowed early in the movie, so when the monsters really appear, it does not seem out of place. You can say this is a Predator movie set in cave. It also helps that all the characters are likable, even the supposedly bad girl. I definitely recommend this movie if anyone wants to enjoy a great horror. P.S. this still will not scare me out of cave exploring. On the contrary, now I am interested in cave exploring.",8,1,2,10 October 2015
Joker," The most grounded portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime, and a phenomenal performance by the great Joaquin Pheonix
","Joker is the most grounded take on a comic book supervillain. With Joaquin Phoenix playing the titular character, I was completely absorbed into the story. Phoenix's Arthur Fleck, who would eventually become the Joker, is a struggling, mentally ill individual who meets constant bullying, and backstabbing. Gotham City, as portrayed in this movie is cold, and decaying. The people are not innocent victims as usually portrayed in other comic book movies. The tone of the movie is very dark, though the visuals is not. Phoenix is able to make his character sympathetic, and while he commits brutal acts of violence, the audience can understand where he is coming from. Phoenix carries the movie completely. None of his scenes are boring, and we see him a lot. Even his physique, frail and contort is like a physical manifestation of his mental state. From start to finish, Phoenix's Arthur Fleck endures physical and mental beatings. It can be seen how a person in need like him is abandoned by society, and nudges him to the dark side. When he commits his first crime and descends into madness, it feels natural. The movie itself does not condone violence, it only shows how violence is ever present, and the social tension was already brimming before it reached a boiling point. While the first question about Joker would be if his performance could compare to Heath Ledger's performance, I would say Phoenix's interpretation is no doubt very impactful and memorable. It feels like a fitting origin story to the Joker. Here, the Joker is no less menacing than Ledger's but only more grounded, more sympathetic, and we actually get to understand what is going on in his head. I highly recommend this movie for any cinema fans. Joaquin Phoenix's performance alone is worth the admission price, and that is not to mean that everything else is not good. The score was perfect, the cinematography, and performances of other actors were great too. My favorite performance was Brett Cullen's Thomas Wayne. The scene where Arthur Fleck meets Thomas Wayne is one of the greatest scenes in the film, and a pivotal moment too. It is great that Thomas Wayne plays an important role in the movie, and that there are no superheroes to save the day. I highly recommend this movie, but if you are expecting comic book action like in a Marvel movie, don't bother. This is a serious cinema piece featuring a comic supervillain. I guess DC movies have found their niche.",9,2,5,5 October 2019
Kong: Skull Island," A group of soldiers accompany a pair of scientists, and a camera woman to chart an unknown island. Little did they know about the monsters that await them.
","Kong Skull Island is a brilliant monster movie featuring fantastic monster fights, and cool monsters. Being a monster movie one would expect to see lots of monsters and tonnes of mayhem. To my surprise, this movie not only lived up to my expectations, but actually exceeded it. The highlight is the monsters, and Kong, the titular monster dominates the screen literally and figuratively. The cinematography was excellent and fully captured the beauty and majesty of the island. The monster shots were perfect, it created the sense of awe and dread of seeing such gigantic beasts roaming around. The monster fights were also fresh, and not just two beasts hugging and roaring. Finally, we get to see Kong as never before, fearsome, majestic, and kind with being too dramatic. The used of 3D was well thought since it transports us to a were where giant creatures could really exist. On the other hand, the human story plays a minor role but serves to move the plot forward; since it is the humans who helped unleash the fury of Kong, and other monsters. However, we cannot deny the brilliant performances of great talents like Samuel L. Jackson who manages to make a generic character feel relatable. John C. Reilly and John Goodman, who are side characters manage to steal the scene from leads Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson. Not to say Tom Hiddleston is not talented, but he is not given much to do as a leading man. Despite the flaws, this movie is a brilliant example of how monster movies should be made, and I can't wait for the follow up as hinted in the post-credit scene. P.s I recommend you not miss the post credit scene.",9,25,49,9 March 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Riggan Thomson tries to regain fame, respect and love by adapting, writing and starring in a Broadway play.
","The summary sounds boring, but the fluid shot makes the story gets you immersed into Riggan Thomson's (Michael Keaton) world, where the lines of reality and fantasy seamlessly connect. The camera shot, the direction, and the performances were perfect. I ended up rooting and empathizing with all the characters, especially Keaton's. Zach Galifianalikis' serious role as Keaton's lawyer was brilliant too and it captures the stress he endures to keep things from tearing apart. Edward Norton's role as a method-actor whose only way to be real is by acting also makes an interesting story. Emma Stone's portrayal as Keaton's troubled daughter was good too. But all these good performances are eclipsed by Keaton's performance. In fact it was so powerful I really rooted for him and was at the edge of my seat three times because of worrying for Keaton's character. That says a lot for a move that is not even a thriller. In the end, I think I will make time to watch it again. Michael Keaton is a brilliant actor, and deserves more good roles. How about a real Birdman movie starring Keaton?",8,0,2,8 October 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," After the events in Metropolis, Superman is both feared and respected. He has to face the consequences, while having to deal with Batman, and an even bigger threat.
","If you liked the Man of Steel, you will definitely enjoy this one. It has great action sequences, and you could actual fear for Superman. The best part of the movie are the actions scenes with its pulse pounding score. The only problem with the movie is that it frags at the end, and the beginning was quite incoherent. Another problem was that the great actors were under-used. Ben Affleck's Batman is yet another incarnation of Batman. Unlike Christian Bale's Batman, who has his principles, Affleck's Batman, or Batfleck is callous and losing his grip. Cavil does not get to do much. Clark Kent and Superman is basically the same, and we do not get to see anything new from him. I think Hank Snyder tried to make Superman more human, and he succeeded ( a bit too well). Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Lex Luthor is over-the-top and annoying. He fails to look calculating or chilling as his character is suggested to be. But the main save of the movie is the action. That alone is the reason I came to watch BVS, and it delivered in spades. Unlike the trailer which suggested an overly dark and depressing movie, this movie had a hopeful ending.",8,5,10,26 March 2016
Da 5 Bloods," A unique and unconventional movie that full provides whole spectrum of emotions from suspense, humor, tragedy, to feeling good.
","Da 5 Bloods is hard to define by its genre but what stands out are the performances of Delroy Lindo and Chadwick Boseman, and that is compared to many great performances. I like how Spike Lee shows contributions of black soldiers in the Vietnam war, and how the Vietnam war is referred as the American War in the movie. Being a Cambodian, that is what we call it too. It also helps that Lee is able to show the different dimensions of the war, and how different sides view the war. He does this through the characters' speech. Though it seems unsubtle, it is seems real. I think he put a real effort to showcase famous black people by showing a black and white footage or newspaper picture of that person after any mention of them. For me, I actually liked that because I get to see more outstanding black individuals besides Martin Luther King , and Malcolm X. It may hurt the story but provides an interesting movie experience.
The movie begins as a story of elderly people meeting up and confronting there demons in Vietnam. The only person who never really healed and keeps getting worse is Delroy Lindo's character. Then it goes to thriller mode when tension boils after finding the gold. There are seemingly 4 wall breaking moments. Despite the unconventional approach, Delroy Lindo carries the movie perfectly. He is a troubled person, and despite his actions, we root and sympathize with him till the end. Chadwick Boseman, who plays the leader of the titular Bloods, Norman is very charismatic and charming. You really believe he could command the full faith of his squad. His death is as devastating to me as it is to the characters, and this takes a great actor to do that.
In the end, Da 5 Bloods is an unconventional movie that hops genres and provides a full range of emotions from thrills, humor, high octane action, sadness, and good feelings. It is a truly unique movie to enjoy.",8,2,3,30 June 2020
Incredibles 2," Elastigirl sets out to fight crime and make superheroes legal again while her husband Mr. Incredible has to stay home and take care of his superkids.
","It is surprisingly good with some fast action scenes. Seeing a superhero handle housework is always fun to watch, and this movie makes the best of it. The comedy is good, the characters relatable, and there is a little mystery to the supervillain Screenslaver, and it is fun try guess who that person is. In short it is a great movie to enjoy for adults and kids.",8,1,2,20 June 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," A story of how a pacifist participated in WWII without firing a single shot.
","Directed by Mel Gibson, I knew this was one movie to look forward too. Starring Andrew Garfield as war medic who chose to serve in World War 2 but not to kill, the movie explores a very unique side of war. In the first part of the movie, we get to know Desmond Doss, our protagonist played by Garfield. We see his trials and tribulations (literally) for following his beliefs. In the next part, we see non-stop action where Garfield's character proves his bravery in battle. The casting choice was brilliant and all the supporting casts have a chance to shine. Hugo Weaving, an already talented actor gave a great performance as Garfield's troubled father, while Vince Vaughn gets to shine as a no-nonsense Sargeant ( which is surprising considering I used to see him in comedic roles). Sam Worthington was also great as Garfield's superior. In the movie, Gibson is able to display the gruesome violence of war without really criticizing war. This is not exactly an antiwar movie, it is just a movie about how a pacifist can apply his beliefs even in war. The soldiers in the movie are portrayed as real humans, with fears. Even the nameless Japanese fighting our protagonists are shown as normal people fighting for their lives. You can say it is an antiwar movie without looking like an antiwar movie. It does not preach pacifism, it just focuses on one pivotal moment in the protagonist's life and this focus makes the movie engaging. The war scenes are really gruesome, as you would expect from a Mel Gibson movie, but the gore serves to heighten the stakes, and not done for just the sake of gore. In short, this is a terrific war drama that delivers without being too weepy, and contains a lot of action and tension. Looking forward to the next Mel Gibson directed movie.",9,6,9,30 March 2017
Alien: Covenant," A ship full of colonists explores an uncharted planet for survivors.
","This installment captures the tone of the original movie a little too well. This means the movie is slow-paced and unoriginal. The only point of interest in this movie is finding out what happened to the characters from Prometheus, especially Noomi Rapace's Dr Shaw. Once the mystery is unveiled, there is nothing new. The movie may benefit from the fact that is a prequel to the original Aliens, but that alone does not make it a worthwhile movie to watch. My advice: watch it when you are in a good mood and have time to kill.",5,0,2,27 July 2017
