The King's Speech," Not so much a review, as a note or two on TKS
","A brilliant movie overall.Two possibly interesting points:A couple of times the king or prince whispers 'brother' or other words under his breath. What is with that?Telling a story to his daughters; the prince rather wickedly hints that the penguin would be turned into what all girls would like -- a handsome prince. Instead he transforms a 'handsome prince' into a 'short-tailed albatross' (which have very long wings) -- much to the dismay of the little girls. The look on one of the girl's faces is priceless.I digress. One may wonder what birds have to do with anything. As an amateur naturalist, I am rather certain of the answer.A good percentage of Brits love and have loved bird-watching for decades.So it would not be surprising for a royal to make references to birds.Just goes to show how detailed the screen writing was.Again I loved this movie.",Null,0,0,13 November 2017
