Black Swan," A truly disturbing film
","I just watched this film last night, when it first came out last year, I thought it was a boring movie, and so I decided to skip it. After hearing a few of my friends talk about how disturbing it was, I finally decided to go and watch it myself. The film starts off slow and it builds up throughout the film, this helps the movie a lot it helps build character, and makes you actually care for them. This movie is truly the most disturbing film I have ever watched in my life. There's one scene in the movie that truly disturbed me and now I will never get the image out of my head, it's a scene in which the main character masturbates, I'm not going to give away to much but, the scene is truly a disturbing moment that even for people, who aren't easily disturbed like myself, will be disturbed by this scene. All of the actors give perfect performances, they all were perfect. The soundtrack was also great, it made the movie even more creepy then it already was. The direction was perfect, it truly made the film what it was, the way the camera moved and shifted truly made this film a perfect one. This movie can get intense at times, and is truly a disturbing film, this film is a masterpiece. 10/10 stars.",Null,2,4,28 May 2011
Iron Man 2," A perfect way to kick off the summer
","When the first Iron man came out I was not that excited but then I saw the movie and it was a great thrill ride and I loved it,and I enjoyed the end credit scene leading up to the avengers. Now comes Iron man 2 two years later my expectations for this film was high and it lived up to them from the opening sequence to the end,one scene that I thought was great and emotional at the same was the party scene when Tony get's drunk and starts to terrorize his guest's I hated seeing Tony like although I must admit when Rhodes come's to fight him that's where things go from serious to funny,with a nice little mix from Dj Am,whose appearance was welcomed.Iron man 2 is not your typical superhero film instead it does something different.When we finally see Warmachine in all his glory he's bad ass,Ivan Vanko is an awesome villain his presence was great,the acting in the movie was top notch,and Robert does another great job.Jon Faveru does a great job at directing and I hope he returns for another one,and stay after the credits,I'm giving this movie a 10/10 it's a perfect way to kick off the summer.",10,6,10,9 May 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Darkest and best one yet
",I have saw all of the harry potter films and read all of the books so I'm a huge fan and must say this was the most faithful to the book by far. You know from the start of the movie that this will not be like the other movies before it. It's starts off very dark with the minister of magic making a speech. The film is really emotional this time around a lot of characters die. For example Dolby the house elf dies and it's really sad to see him die the way he does I almost had tears in my eyes. And if you do not like snakes then do not see this there are two major scenes that involve a snake the first one is at the start of the film and this scene is rather creepy and disturbing. The second scene has a jump scene so if your scared of snakes then don't go. The movie has a little bit of blood in it. If you liked the series from the start then you will love this one if not then this will not really change your mind. Now I cannot wait for the second film.,7,1,3,19 November 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spiderman Delivers
","The Amazing Spider Man tells the story of Peter Parker a young teenager in high school who one day gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, he undergoes changes from this. The Amazing Spider Man is one of those films where I wasn't looking forward to it at first because it was a reboot, and usually with reboots they end up being bad. When I saw the teaser for the film last year, I thought it made Spider Man look like it was going to be dark and gritty, like The Dark Knight was but this was not the case with the actual film. The Amazing Spider Man may be darker then the original Rami films, but it also has plenty of jokes in it to balance it out. I think why The Amazing Spider Man mainly works for is because the story draws you in, sure its a bit of a generic story but then again so are most other movies of this genre. The film tells the story of Peter Parker and what happens to him when he gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider and how the changes affect him, it also focuses on the relationships that Peter has with his Aunt and uncle, Gwen Stacy and her father, and Dr. Connors. This is why I think the movie focuses on so many levels, it focuses on the story first and then the action later, its about the relationships in Peter's life its about the changes Peter faces and how they affect his life. The Amazing Spider Man also delivers on the action and not once during the film does the action get confusing. The only downfall for the movie is that there isn't to many action scenes, while this isn't a bad thing I still would have to liked to see a few more scenes between The Lizard and Spider Man.All of the actors in the movie delivers solid performances but for me the breakout performance in the movie would have to be Andrew Garfield as Spider Man, if there was one thing the movie had going for it, it would be Garfield. Ever since I saw Garfield in The Social Network I've been a big fan of his, I think Garfield was the perfect choice to portray both Peter Parker and Spiderman because he fits the role so perfectly and delivers a great performance that stands out in the movie, I think Garfield should win an award for his performance. Emma Stone also delivered a strong performance as Gwen Stacy, she made you believe that a girl like her would fall for a nerd like Peter Parker, Emma Stone makes you believe in the relationship that her and Peter has. I would also like to point out that Rhys Ifans delivers a solid performance as Dr. Connors and The Lizard, he makes you feel for the character even though The Lizard is your typical Villain. The Amazing Spider Man is the best Spider Man film yet, it delivers on everything you would expect from a Spider Man movie and make sure to stay during the end credits as there's a scene mid way through.",7,3,9,12 July 2012
Batman Begins," A darker and grittier Batman that works
","Batman begins is the first in what is now The Dark Knight trilogy, Batman begins focuses on the origin of Bruce Wayne and how he came became Batman and the hero we know today.What makes Batman Begins work is that it focuses on Bruce Wayne and how he became Batman. Unlike the other films at this point, Begins doesn't start off with already having Bruce Wayne as Batman but rather just as Bruce Wayne. Begins has a drastic darker tone when compared to the previous Batman films, this is a good thing for me because I think having a darker and more grittier Batman works well.The acting in this movie is top notch, everyone delivers a good performance. Having Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne and Batman really paid off in this movie because Bale breathes life into the character, but for me I think Bale is a little better as Batman and delivers a perfect performance. The rest of the cast all deliver a good performance but they don't really stand out to me, the only other actor here who I can think of who almost matches Bale's Performance would be Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox as Freeman delivers one of his best performances in a movie.The writing in Batman Begins works well most of the time, however there are a few times during the movie where the dialogue seemed a little off and even a bit cheesy. Most of the time though the dialogue does work and doesn't distract you from the rest of the movie, to me the writing is the only thing stopping this from being a perfect movie.Everything in Begins looks beautiful, I think this is mostly due to the cinematographer Wally Pfister who really captures the look of Gothem City and what it has become. Batman Begins is one of the best superhero films of all time, it's also the best Bat film we've had yet.",8,1,1,18 July 2012
28 Days Later...," A Horror Movie, with style.
","28 days later is one of the best horror films I've seen a while, the plot of the film is simple but effective. The film has a slow pace to it, but it works well for the film. The movie while not scary is quite creepy in a lot of ways. The plot of the movie is about a virus that escapes from a British research facility, then 28 days later we meet our main character Jim, and well the movie just continues on from there, if I said anything else, it would spoil the movie for you.The story in this film works quite well, even though it's a simple one about a virus that infects people, it still works quite well. I don't think this film would have worked as well as it did, if it didn't such a great script. The film itself is slow paced, it takes time to develop its characters, instead of just killing them before we get to know them, and this is a nice change for once. This film isn't another mindless horror film, but a smart one that dares to be different. There are a few jump scares in this film of course, but they work rather well, and they're not the stupid, typical, crap that we usually see in horror films. The true horror behind this movie is not the virus itself, but the humans in the story, the humans that haven't been affected yet. I'm not talking about our main characters, but characters we meet later on in the film, who we think we can trust, but we really can't. The characters in this film are all developed in a great way that shows that a horror film can have characters that you actually care for, and not want to die. The film has a few surprises in it, that you won't see coming, now I won't tell you what they are, because that would spoil the movie for you. There's a scene towards the third act of the film that was disturbing, it's a scene involving our main characters, who just happen to have met up with the wrong people, this scene works quite well, because you're not expecting it all, you thought you could trust these people, but in reality you never could. I have to say that this scene was the best in the film, because of the way it was directed, the way the script work, but most of all because of the actors portraying the characters, I don't think the scene would've worked nearly as well, hadn't been for the actors portraying these characters.Now the acting in the film itself is actually quite good. Each of the actors, give their best performance in the film, even if they're just in the film for a few moments. I have to say though, that the best actor in the film would have to be Megan Burns, she did an amazing job with portraying her character Hannah, the performance she gave, was just such an amazing one. Now the rest of the actors all did great as well, but Megan Burns just stood out from the rest, she had that charm that the rest of the actors didn't have. But like I said, they all did well in their own way.Overall I would say watch this film, even if you don't like horror movies, I think you'd enjoy this one. It's not like every other horror film; it has a different feel to it.",8,0,1,6 October 2011
The Dark Knight," Lacks the punch of Begins, but The Dark Knight still delivers
","The Dark Knight is the second film in the Christopher Nolan trilogy of Batman films. Being a fan of the first film, Batman Begins, I had huge expectations for this I was expecting it to be just as good if not better then Begins. While The Dark Knight may lack the punch that Begins had, it's still a great film in its own right.The Dark Knight is one of those films that does so much right but yet you feel that it could've been a better movie. I think the main problem with The Dark Knight is that it focus to much on the Joker and doesn't spend enough time on Bruce Wayne and Batman, while The Joker does make for a great villain, I still would've liked to see more time spent on Bruce Wayne and Batman. Once again the acting in The Dark Knight is solid, everyone delivers great performances. Heath Ledger delivers the best performance in the film, delivering a Joker that is both creepy and fun. Ledger owns the role and is the best Joker we've seen in a Batman film yet, I don't think his performance in The Dark Knight will ever be topped. Once again Bale delivers a great performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman and had it not been for Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker, Bale would once again be the best actor in the film.The story mostly works for The Dark Knight, having said that though I feel that the story wasn't as focused as it was in the first film. The story here focuses to much time on The Joker and not enough on other characters, the only character that I feel get's as much time as The Joker is Harvey Dent. I would have to say Dent is the best character in this film because you get emotionally invested in him, you feel for him and once you see what happens to him in the end, you can't help but feel bad for him because Dent could've became a hero in his own right. The story while not as good as Begins, does work overall.The Dark Knight may not be as great as film as Begins, but it still delivers.This review is dedicated in memory of Heath Ledger.",7,0,2,20 July 2012
Thor," A mighty way to kick off the summer movie season
","I just got back from seeing Thor at my local theatre, and I have to admit I was impressed by it. To those who are wondering to go see it or not, you should it's different then the other super hero movies. Thor is based on the marvel comic of the same name, it's of course about the God of thunder Thor. The movie starts off on earth, then changes to Asgard. I have to admit the Asgard scenes were some of the best visuals I've ever seen in a movie, some of the visuals even match that of Avatar. Of course all of the actors were great. Loki was just a bad ass I wasn't expecting to like him but I did. For once they made you feel for the villain they gave him emotion. Loki is quite the character and by the end of the movie you kind of end up feeling sorry for him and the way he's been treated. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddston give the best performances of the whole movie I have to admit. The action scenes were great in the movie, exactly what you would expect from Thor. The movie ends with a bang, and if you don't know already there's a scene after the credits, so stay for that. Now I saw this in 3D so as far as that goes, the movie did a good job with it, it's the best 3D converted movie I have seen, but not the best 3D movie. Some of the scenes really didn't seem 3D, which is why it's only decent 3D for, the scenes that really worked in 3D were Asgard and the action scenes. I'd say go see it in 3D if you like 3D movies, but 2D would be just as good. Anyway I'm giving Thor a 10/10.",7,2,5,8 May 2011
X-Men: First Class," The Best X-Men Film Yet
","I have to admit that I was a little worried about X-Men First Class; after all it was prequel and a fresh new start to the series. I'm glad to say that I was worried for nothing, because X-Men First Class is easily the best X-Men film to date. X-Men First Class is mainly about how Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr became enemies. This is about how the X-Men first started, now I have to admit I have never read the comics, so I wouldn't the history of X-Men that good.I'll start off with the acting of X-Men First Class; everyone does a good job with whatever role they have, even if it's only a small brief role. But I have to say the best two actors in this film are James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. James McAvoy does great as Charles Xavier and in some ways reminds me of a younger version of Patrick Stewart, and even surpasses him as Charles Xavier. James McAvoy stands out in this film; he surpasses his co-stars in every possible way including Michael Fassbender. Now while I did enjoy McAvoy's performance better than Fassbender's I have to admit that Fassbender is the next best actor in the film, he really makes you believe in the character of Erik Lehnsherr, he makes you feel for his character, which is a first in an X-Men film. Fassbender gives a great performance, that's almost as good as McAvoy's.Now I'm going to talk about the film itself, the plot is quite simple like I said previous it's mainly about Charles and Erik, with the backstory of how the X-Men first started. Now in this movie we have a new enemy that we have not seen before, his name is Sebastian Shaw, and he's played by the great Kevin Bacon. I have to say Kevin Bacon really pulls off this role, in such a great way it was like he was born to play Sebastian. Now onto the character himself, I'm not going to lie, I liked the character of Shaw. I just found him to be such a great character that you actually cared for, yes he's the villain of the film, and I know we supposed to hate him. But I couldn't help but to like his character, maybe that was because of Kevin Bacon's performance as Shaw, who knows. Now Shaw does get help of course from his group, which by the way are called The Hellfire Club. For me everyone else in that group, seemed like the typical villains, yeah sure they were cool but in the long run they were nothing but typical villains whose only purpose, was to assist Shaw. That is my only knock on the film, is that the villains were not given much to work with other then to stand there, and kill for the hell of it. As far as the rest of the story goes, I have to say that they did a great job in showing how the X-Men First started, and showing how Charles and Erik became enemies.",8,0,1,5 October 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan completes the trilogy on a high note
","The Dark Knight Rises takes place eight years after the events of the first film, Wayne is no longer Batman and the city of Gothem are mourning over the loss of Harvey Dent. Everything in Gothem seems to be peaceful until Bane shows up to wreck Gothem.Having not being a huge fan of The Dark Knight, I wasn't sure at first how The Dark Knight Rises was going to be because for me The Dark Knight was just a pretty decent movie. Having said that though, I'm happy to say The Dark Knight Rises improves on The Dark Knight and in doing so, The Dark Knight Rises is the best batman film in Nolan's trilogy.What makes this film work so well is the story is well developed and the characters have development, The Dark Knight Rises has the best story out of all three Batman films and has the most character development. I think why this movie works on so many levels is because of what has come before it, Nolan has had time to develop most of the characters over the span of the other two films and in doing so he has created a trilogy of films that work well. The Dark Knight Rises is a game changer simply because of the fact it dares to be different, it makes you care about the characters. There were a few times during the film where I got teary eyed, I won't ruin these scenes for you but let's just say they have quite the emotional punch.The performances in this film are all good but for me the breakout performance from The Dark Knight Rises was from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, I think Levitt brought his character to life and gave emotion to his character. Everyone else does a solid performance including Anne Hathaway, who at first I was skeptical about because I didn't think she would fit the role, yet she delivers a great performance. The Dark Knight Rises is easily the darkest of all three Nolan Batman films, it has a certain tone to it that makes it stand out from the other two films. The movie has a bleak dark feel to it that works and makes the film stand out, the dark tone really works well with what's going on. There's a lot going on in The Dark Knight Rises so at times it does feel a little fast, but this isn't a problem as everything is well developed. The Dark Knight Rises is the perfect example of how to do a superhero film right, The Dark Knight Rises is easily the best superhero film to date.If you're a fan of Nolan's other two Bat films or just like Batman and other superhero movies, I'd recommend you give this one a check as it really is the best bat film to date.",10,1,4,21 July 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The Perfect Potter Film
","Let me begin this review by saying that I'm a huge Potter Fan, I have all of the books and movies, I've enjoyed them all even if the movies do make changes to the books. But I have to say this film was the closest one to the book, it still made some changes to the material but as far as I'm concerned these changes were not that big, unlike the previous films in the series, fans of the book should enjoy this film as much as the non fans will. The film is quite short, the shortest of the series, running for about two hours and ten minutes.. But this also happens to be the best film in the series, the acting of the main lead actors has improved a lot since the first film which came out ten years ago, out of all three I have to say Daniel Radcliff is the best of the group, he delivers his line in such a perfect way, this is not to say the other two actors are not great, because they are in their own way. But as good as they are, they are no match for Alan Rickman who play's Snape with such an ease, Rickman is truly Snape I cannot picture anyone playing but Rickman, and you'll see why if you go and see this film, his acting has always been great in the films but in this one he really delivers a truly developed character that you feel for, even if you happen to hate Snape. All of the other supporting actors are all great as well, but I had to mention the three main leads and Alan Rickman because they all steal the show, especially Rickman. As far as the story goes, this is the best of them all because the story is much more developed this time around, the stakes are high and you can just feel it. There's so much happening in the movie that you can hardly breath, not that this is a bad thing because it's a wonderful thing, the characters are even more developed this time around and it shows because you start to care for all of them even the characters that don't really matter to the story, they are all developed in their own way. The only problem I have with the movie is the battle it's a little short but this is only a minor problem and it does not stop the movie from being perfect in my option, I hope you guys enjoyed my review for the film, and I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did, thank you for taking time out of your day to read this.",8,0,1,16 July 2011
