Requiem for a Dream," A good t-shirt movie
","Overcooked?  This film is akin to having a blow dry with an acetylene torch. If, as a film maker, you are going to comprehensively humiliate yourself with a truly awful picture, the kind that makes 'The Boost' appear subtle, then it's important to have Jennifer Connelly along for the ride. Jennifer usually lets her t-shirt do the talking, which is why I've got a soft spot for her. She persists in exploring the issue of sexuality, memorably having sex against a wall in 'Heart Of Justice' with Eric Stoltz. Well, memorable because she wasn't wearing a t-shirt at the time.  Seizing the chance for yet another t-shirt movie (who can forget 'Career opportunities'? It was white) and dutifully losing the odd pound for the sake of authenticity, Jennifer gives us a butchers at a nice purple t-shirt and then extends her range with some lurid sex scenes. In fact, we get to see more of Jennifer than ever before, so enamoured is she of her t-shirt that she becomes forgetful about the rest of her ensemble. But back to the sex, we get a hilarious scene where Jennifer performs a sexual act which, to the un-initiated, should be excrutiating.  Instead, Jennifer's face suggests the mild irritation of having to deal with a poorly adjusted panty hose. Later, she vomits at the camera perhaps making courting couples in the theatre nostalgic over their first date.  The trouble is, despite all her sterling efforts to explore her dark side and become one of those 'real' actresses, as opposed to a t-shirt actress; decadence does not, and arguably never has, suited our Jenny.  She seems curiously out of place in all her films, in a way I can't quite put my finger on, but here it's easy to spot.  She's way too old for the part.Still, this is as nothing compared to the indignities heaped upon poor Ellen Burstyn's head.  'You should stand back and let it happen' states director Aronofsky, clearly in awe of history.  No, a hands off approach is the last thing you want in regards to the old school who will chew the scenery with the best of them, going so far over the top that they need a parachute to get down the other side.  With gravity defying hair not seen since 'The Bride Of Frankenstein', Ellen is put through some ridiculously silly scenes, my favourite being a laboriously scripted lament at a kitchen table.  You half expect that flashing arrow with 'author's message' from the Woody Allen scripted 'What's New Pussycat?' To come down and point at her head.  If Aronofsky had thought of it he would have settled for no less than Burstyn flying around the room on the arrow in a grotesque parody of the title sequence of 'Bewitched' before no doubt flying into a carnivorous dish washer.  Besides, doesn't all this trendy Quentin Tarantino-esque benevolence strike one as patronising and a sort of un-earned vanity?Still, the rum goings on in this preposterous picture seem to have afforded it 'classic' status amongst the undiscriminating and easily impressed, that is, young people.  Have you met them, the young? They get into all kinds of scrapes but are mostly armless.  They pull our legs with great earnestness declaring that 'they've been there' while in reality they are more likely to have sustained no more than a grazed knee taking this film back to the rental shop.  Personally, I blame the parents, as does Mr Aronofsky by the looks of this film.  He doesn't so much wear his influences on his sleave as put up a giant billboard.  You can pick any two films but 'Liquid Sky' springs to mind, coupled with any Tex Avary cartoon.  He even manages to crib 'La Jetee', the ultimate film student cliche, probably appropriate as this is really one of those ten minute 'let's pretend grown ups' graduation films extended to nearly two hours. I think the whole thing smacks of desperation and laziness as film makers have less time (if any at all) to make their names in a fiercely competitive market that spits people into TV land if they don't make a big noise as quickly as possible. This is puerile stuff from a 32 year old. To say this bogus 'alternative' film making has more integrity than so called 'mainstream cinema' is a bit naughty.It's a good t-shirt movie but little else.",Null,1,3,5 November 2001
The Sound of Music," The hills *cough* are alive *swallow* with the *splutter*
","This film has had an indelible impact on popular culture. How do I know this? Because recently I sat through an end of term school musical featuring my cousins which drew heavily from it, although it was called 'my favourite things' to avoid any copyright complications. This startling production interpreted the material in a way that made Robert Wise look like a no-talent. The opening 'What are we going to do about Maria?' song was sung by both nuns and Nazis. Was this a political critique on the alleged cooperation between the catholic church and National Socialism sadly left out of Wise's shallow version? And do you remember a black Nazi in the original? It would have been a better film if it had one, I'm sure. Rad to the highest degree, I think is the parlance. On the stage, our Maria dwarfed Captain Von Trapp who was in danger of being trodden on and looked about six. Actually, I think he WAS six. Was Christopher Plummer dressed like a restaurant Maitre De? Perhaps if he had been his performance would have seen a bit less, well, wooden. Or stiff. Idle vice, idle vice.However, all doubts were dispelled when the headmaster insisted we join in a rousing rendition of 'Climb every mountain'. Great! I always loved that song. It always filled me with a profound motivation to go and make a cup of tea. The Rogers and Hammerstein score, I thought, was so complex that only top notch talent could pull it off. I was wrong. Four year olds can do it. Providing you confiscate their mobile phones as a motivating tool. This film is so sacharine that I can only watch bits and pieces of it. Behind a re-inforced concrete pillbox with goggles. Ear muffs optional, but recommended. Fantastic romantic scene 'You are sixteen' has not been bettered since. The school play tried, but 'You are ten, going on eleven' didn't have the same resonance (and sounds a bit suspect too!)But where the two versions come together is the triumph of evil by good. Sadly, Robert Wise missed out on the inspired idea of having the Nazis chase each other in circles everytime they are given an order like in the school play, but Hollywood never did get satire. But who cares? The music lives on long after our teeth have rotted. And if our Julie can no longer sing 'The hills are alive', then there are plenty of toddlers who can take her place. As long as a percentage of the box office take can be negotiated with their agents, of course. And I can do it too.'CLIIIIIIIMB EVERY MOUNTAAAAYENNNN....CROSS EVERY STUREEEEEEEEAM!I'm parol....I mean, I'm free from next thursday onwards.",Null,1,8,29 July 2000
Se7en," And the next
","Just after you thought Hollywood couldn't sink any lower after giving Silence of the lambs the film of the year oscar they come up with this. Old style hollywood films weren't necessarily realistic but they did suggest life might be worth enjoying. The ludicrous and wildly inappropriate rock video titles and end titles tell you all you need to know about the hypocrisy behind this film. Despite the fact that the film critiques apathy it chooses the done to death subject of serial murder. Yawn. Even the excitingly shot chase in the middle rips off Blade Runner. It's all lazy stuff with some philosophical disclaimer tagged on at the end to make us think we've witnessed art rather than the bottom line of making a fast buck. It's meritricious crap. But what about Pitt's ridiculous performance, eh? There's no coherence at all, just some constant and bizarre jerking of the head all the time. The scene where he's chewing the fat with freeman about commitment is particularly gem. Keep still man, do you think if you keep trying to evade the camera we won't notice its you? What's sad is films like these have influenced television drama producers into doing dozens of carbon copy series in the UK. Stuff that used to be banned as video nasties now find pride of place in peak slots. The explicit nature of series such as Cracker, Something Evil and McCallum with their gruesome crime scenes and autopsies defies belief. One such plot had a serial killer despatching women by setting them alight with petrol. Thanks America.",Null,0,0,7 January 2000
Unbreakable," *Possible SPOILERS*
","That there is something special about Mel Gibson's buttocks is no surprise to thousands of women (and some men, no doubt.) That there is also something magical about Bruce Willis's buttocks may come as a more surprising plot twist in this bizarre and frequently risible film. How do we know this? Well, Mr Willis plays a stadium security guard and while perusing a queue for undesirable elements, the camera takes a lingering interest in his hind quarters followed by some flashing. Yes, Mr Willis has SUPER BUTTOCKS! But they must be dry buttocks or else there can be a technical hitch. Fortunately for Willis, the film did not take place in the UK during the year 2000 or else his buttocks would have suffered from a constant flat battery. Still, he has the very slow drip-drip of the screenplay to contend with.There was a lot of barely suppressed giggling through-out the showing of this movie, not least during a spectacularly irresponsible gun scene and an impromptu wrestling match in a bedroom. In fact, the mere sight of Mr Willis in his security coat was enough to get me going, but my favourite bit was when Samuel L Jackson, with a seventies super-fly guy black leather jacket and walking stick, chases (or wobbles after) someone across a road. You half expect the deep boom of Isaac Hays to waft over the speakers:'Whose the stretcher case to all the chicks? - SPLINT!'But full honours must go to the hilarious scene in the station in which every kleptomaniac, date rapist, sociopath and serial killer in America happen to coincidently converge on Bruce Willis causing an immediate flashing buttock over-load. But are there that many bad people walking around in America? I think the more likely outcome would be *flash* tax fiddle *flash* un-payed phone bill *flash* forgot to feed cat *flash* didn't call mum at weekend. Also, the visual reference to Christ was un-called for. We recall a bright halo floating above that admirable fellow, but a conspicuous lack of flashing buttocks in pursuit of good works. Perhaps modern methods are needed in this case.But searching for the hero inside yourself can bring rich rewards. Willis's wife starts looking at him with bedroom eyes again, proving the old saying that if you love a man's buttocks, you gotta love the man. But Mr Willis's buttocks fail him when confronted by the director in a cameo, suggesting that the director may be wet behind the ears resulting in kryptomite-like problems. Not that there is anything wrong with being wet behind the ears, or a nerd who likes comic books. I've got a collection stashed away in an attic surrounded by surveillance cameras and 24-hour guard dogs. According to the title sequence, Americans purchase a huge amount of comics which, by implication, must have had an effect on the culture. But the director seems to contradict this by boldly suggesting with little evidence that Americans are in despair and unwilling to believe in heroes. You can't have it both ways, can you? It's arguable that screen actors have replaced comic book heroes, only with bigger egos. Despite his superhero status, Willis's name is surprisingly small on the poster. He's got a little Willis. The poster it has to be said, is considerably brighter than anything in the film which continues a depressing trend in modern cinema towards filters that turn planet earth into a bewildering array of murky colours. We've had sepia in 'Gladiator' and 'Erin Brockovitch', blue in God knows how many pictures and in 'Payback' a memorable bleached bluey-grey. Does it make the picture better? This film takes place during a permanent lunar eclipse.Shyamalan resists doing something naff like pulling back to reveal the entire film taking place in a comic book but seeing as there are 281.4 million people presently living in the States, the success of the dastardly villain's plans seem somewhat statistically unlikely. This haziness with numbers extends to Willis's conclusion to Elijah that he is 75% sure he isn't the hurting kind. How he arrived at this figure is something of a mystery. I mean, is he 75% sure he's had all his hair chopped off or only 70% sure? Is the extra 5% due to confusion over the status of designer stubble? When he plunges head first into that swimming pool does he think he's 50% wet or only 40%? How can he not be sure that 15% of him isn't actually lying in bed with his wife? But we're at least 83% sure that Shyamalan can still tell a good yarn but whether or not he has wings remains to be seen. And I'm 110% sure that squint-o-vision has definitely had it's day.",Null,0,0,29 December 2000
Fight Club," The best film ever?(Possible SPOILERS, pass by if you haven't seen it.)
","The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fightclub so I won....Oh,shut up. Well, we've all seen it (more than once too) and most of us loved it so what's left to say? Well, I want to praise you like I should, as the song goes. This is a film I shouldn't have liked as it's yet another cartoon from America and I tried hard not to. Glip? Trite ? Meritricious?....but to no avail, I'm doomed to love this genuinely gobsmacking picture. The one fault it has is it's ten minutes too long. You think: 'Guys, I love you, but you're exhausting me so let's rap it up', which they do with such a spine tingling, poignant and phenomenal ending that you forgive it even that flaw. The song over the end titles was so hot I stayed right to the end. It's rare you leave an American film thinking it's the best film ever made and the most fun you've ever had in a theatre. Many couldn't accept the plot twist and I think this is because they loved the character in question so much. The radical and brave departure was right though. It made for a funnier and more truthful film as most men aren't supercool like that. Others have complained that the film doesn't take a clear stand and leaves you to have to make up your own mind. Surely this is it's virtue and what makes it so unusual? Is it profound or just a comedy about a man who goes mad? Is the ending optimistic or does it say that trying to change your life or society is futile or unattainable due to man's inherent flaws and vanities? Script, direction and performances are masterly and will set the bench mark for others to beat for years to come, not that film making is a race. There are so many great lines and observations that it's almost four films in one. The scene where Durden speculates that god may, in fact, hate you is a whole theme for a film in itself. There are some nice in-jokes. I presume the narrator wanted to fight William Shatner because of that Star Trek episode 'Shore Leave' where Kirk has an outrageously long and violent punch up with a man called Finnegan who is not real. It all ties in. The film's ending may go along more conventional lines with a ticking bomb but I suspect this is just to send up guy movies whereby someone has to always decide which wire to pull. And this is the ultimate guy pic. Another reviewer below made the astute observation that the film is really quite humane and the humour is never sarcastic but has a more Zen like reflectiveness. That's on the money. Whether you like the film will depend on your sense of humour which varies from person to person. It pokes fun at men and our need to follow others as well as other foibles. It is also ambivalent and unjudgemental about our need for aggression and excitement. I remember about three years I thought about asking my sister's commanlaw husband to have a punch up with me just for fun. I don't know why, but it proves the film is on to something. At the end of the day this film may just be rock and roll, a fun picture not to be taken too seriously. I think it was Tarkovsky who said that lots of editing and trying to entertain an audience visually was inimicable to great art. This film pulls off the trick of both leading you on and also being very wide open. It may fall into the trap of trying to make the lead character more sympathetic to the audience by making him appear ignorant of his own mayhem, and empathy is good box office, but as I said before you really have to clutch at straws to criticise this stunning and outrageous picture. The studio who financed it took a risk in making a film with content you'd expect to see in an indi feature, so reward their faith by going to see this picture or there won't be another for a long time.",Null,0,1,22 January 2000
Alien: Resurrection," The desperate hours
","Here's one to provoke the dreaded cliche 'that's two hours of my life I won't get back.' What would you be doing instead, curing cancer, running for president? No, you'd be lounging around with a joint reading a comic book, so don't complain about 'Alien Resurrection'. It's only an hour of my life I won't get back. Some people do get their life back however, like Ripley for instance. Goodness, she's in need of a trip to the hair salon. Perhaps she went and displeased with the results, burned the stylist's hands off. Her attempts to be a bad girl are embarrassing. The director has a vision. Hire as many actors as possible that will frighten the aliens with their looks. I thought it was supposed to be the reverse. Poor Ron Perlman, a talented actor, is called in to play a grotesque again. But the casting director has screwed up and there is someone fanciable in the mix. So he quickly disappears screaming into a hole and the natural order is restored. But come on, I hear you say, what about Winona Ryder, is she not fragrant? Yes, but she is rendered ugly by profane dialogue which always smacks of desperation. Surprisingly, Buffy maestro Joss Whedon is the culprit. With her pixie face and big eyes looking up at you, Ryder invokes the memory of Bambi, although you wouldn't put up with this from Uncle Walt. 'Hey, Thumper, some **** just shot my mummy.' - 'Now, Bambi, if you can't say anything nice....' No, the F-word is not for Winona, just marshmellows. The cast have big guns and spin around 180 degrees hamming wildly but cannot disguise the lack of story. These are desperate times for actors. Brad Dorif hangs by his finger nails on the outside of the Hollywood lifeboat. Yes, I am old but I have a pony tail, please let me on board. I can do sinister. I can do dead. Please! Oh, alright then. I've never understood the word 'franchise' in respect to film, I associate it with burgers. The budgets plummet. One scene in a space ship cockpit (are they called cockpits?) Seems to have what looks like a painted backdrop outside the window. Look closer and there are probably five sharp edges on the stars and a half moon with a cow jumping over it. Tacky stuff. The plot is confusing. They hired a european director. They hired a French director. It's time to cut one's losses and realise that although there is indeed an hour I won't ever get back there's still time to do something positive with the remaining hour. Like work for world peace. In my sleep.",Null,0,1,15 October 2001
Blade," A frosty reception
","The first ten minutes of this film are so visually striking that you know the climax won't outdo it so why go on watching?  And thus it proves. A young buck is invited to a rave that uncomfortably borrows from a scene in 'Schindler's List'. Very distasteful, guys.  This is an unusual rave, in any case.  Ravers with a tab stuck in each fang?  Either way, the young buck has a lucky escape as the less than friendly ravers suffer a dehydration problem rarely seen at an all-nighter.Love the names in this flick. Krieger. Abraham Whistler. Dragonetti. Blade, also known as Eric *giggle*.  Better than Fred, I suppose.  Is this a Phillip Ridley film?  Oh, I nearly forgot Deacon Frost.  Mostly because he's hard to see without cricking your neck.  He should be called Deacon Blue, he's a 'real gone kid'.  In fact, he's positively dead. Deacon Frost, who fancies himself as 'the man', (or 'the vamp', if you want to be pedantic) has trouble stamping authority on the proceedings due to his aforementioned lack of stature and it's the dominating distraction in the film. Christopher Lee used to be lot more imposing playing Dracula due to his height but Dorff reminds me of an anorexic Freddie Starr, although he won't be eating any hamsters.  They're taller than he is.  His dress sense doesn't do him any favours in the world domination stakes either. Natty seventies puce velvet suit and flares invoke pity rather than terror.  Dorff's face betrays the fact that the material is beneath him although it's hard to imagine anything getting beneath this diminutive Nosferatu (I know the lingo!) Truculent and obviously suffering from an inferiority complex, he noticeably stays on his feet around a conference table of distinctly wishy-washy vampire mafiosi who understandably disapprove of his bolshiness.  Unfortunately, when he eventually sits down in a leather chair he practically disappears altogether.  He's way too grumpy and needs to get out more, which being a vampire is hard.  Or is it? in a very funny scene he gets to go out in broad daylight by wearing special make up.  What about his eyes and hair?  Don't their clothes usually set fire anyway? (And Frost's togs definately need to go). Perhaps he greased them up too.  Hey, slimy guy, slimy suit. The reason he needs to go out in the day is to taunt his arch enemy....ERIC! They should have got Buffy the vampire slayer to tackle him, at least they'd be eyeball to eyeball.  With Blade, Deacon Frost is eyeball to.....well, modesty prevents me.  Anyway, the world's too big for both of them. Actually, it isn't, there's plenty of room for Frost. In fact, he's too small even to audition for a remake of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' (why can't they make them like that, anymore?) But despite having to stand on an off-camera box the entire picture he aims to get even with Blade and turn into *SUPER VAMP*! Then it won't matter how tall he is, thank you very much.
Wesley Snipes plays Blade with the usual nonchalance we wearily expect from him.  He is aided by a doctor played by N.Buste Wright in a performance so flat you could fax her to the set. Ms Wright has an archetypal James Bond moment when she is tossed into a cell to face something nasty but is blessed with possibly the biggest air vent in film history to crawl out of.  Kris Kristofferson fairs better as a grizzled old vampire hunter and is rather fun if you're in the right mood, which I'm not.Since the advent of video games, Hollywood has felt an unnecessary need to compete with the former's kineticism with predictably silly and tedious results and the trend sadly shows little signs of abating.

Snatch," 'Do you want to go to the toilet?'
","*Possible spoilers*
The first genuine laughs appear twenty minutes into the film with some witty stuff about a getaway driver who is too big for his car. That's your lot though, with just a few uncomfortable titters from an ominously subdued audience there-after, the humour coming across like the cynical laughter of a hand bag snatcher who has robbed a pensioner. Several adjectives spring to mind while watching this dispiriting drivel: brutal, cruel, empty, repellent, trite, repetitive. Because of this there is nothing to entertain you or to find the slightest bit enjoyable.In the Snatch universe, mankind is base and indistinguishable from the animals in the picture. A dog chasing a hare is juxtaposed with a man being deliberately set upon by Rotweillers. Black people are portrayed as stupid and every other ethnic group as venal at best. Life is about individualism and greed. You are in debt to people and the worst that can happen to you is ending up as broke as you started in a zero sum game or cut to pieces and fed to pigs, literally 'returned to the earth from whence you came'. The world as abattoir. This makes the film an avowedly satanic tract, and the fact that this is seen as synonymous with commerciality makes it a long, depressing non-sequitur. I don't think it IS commercial, but there you have it. Who is the audience for this film? Despite this being a non-secular age supposedly disinterested in politics, Britain has always been a Christian country and I suspect some people will feel assaulted by this film without quite being able to put their finger on knowing why. It will be interesting to see how it does at the box office. It is horrific and affected me surprisingly deeply.The scene with the police and an excuse involving a dog is actually taken from a real life incident with a gangster employee of the Kray twins. Likewise, this film is designed to be like one long pub anecdote, and it's no accident that this format was chosen as it puts the characters at a distant, as mere cyphers, so that it can concentrate exclusively on what it is truly turned on by: violence. It is a film in the service of evil rather than as an ironic counterpart to it.'I've seen some performers in my time, but he enjoys his work. And that's not the half of it.'",Null,0,0,4 September 2000
Taxi Driver," Overcharged fare, spoiler
","I didn't believe in the ending to this picture. I think it's highly unlikely that a man could murder several people with illegal guns wearing a mohican and showing such obvious signs of psychosis and then just walk away withought any punishment. It just wouldn't go down that way. He'd end up having tea with nurse Ratchett for a very long time. Scorcese is an overrated director who had a ridiculous number of films entered in 'the best films' encyclopedia in my local reference library. The only one they missed off was 'Alice doesn't live here anymore', which is the only one I like. Of course, it's about a women and not the usual macho fantasies, which I reckon is the reason why he's so unjustly popular with the critics. They'd all love to be one of those guys. Scorcese plaigarised this ending for 'King of comedy' and with incredible lack of imagination remade 'Goodfellows' in another three hour gangster film called 'Casino' with more or less the same message and ending. What a dullard he is. This film has a couple of good scenes. The scene where DeNiro asks the wizard for help in the streets is particularly gem, but if all the prints of this film mysteriously burnt overnight, it wouldn't be missed.",Null,0,1,2 February 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," He's a pinball wizard.....
","*SPOILERS*Jackson movie about some place called Middle Earth which has a giant squid (where's Kirk Douglas when you need him, eh?) Star Wars was criticised in it's day for it's bad dialogue but in retrospect it was witty and you liked the characters for it.  The colourless characters and earnest, incomprehensible dialogue offers little for the kiddies here. It's a hoot for us wrinklies, though.Jackson's directorial style consists of an establishing shot followed by a pan into someone's face until they fill the screen and then staying there for minutes at a time.  Cut to another character and then slowly pan in again until you see their blackheads.  One of them mentions the ring; show ring on table and pan in until it's a very big ring indeed.  It's uncomfortable and annoying, not to mention psychologically unwise as it's considered an invasion of personal space if someone puts their face up close to yours.  After the 180th close up of Messrs Lee and McKellen, don't be surprised if your eyes turn back to front inside their sockets, drop down your throat and a red sign with a hundred pops out your head.The plot consists of a chap called Frodo getting chased by men on horseback, putting on the ring, falling flat on his back, getting up again, gets chased by the horsemen, puts on the ring, falls over, gets up again, gets chased again. I don't know why they didn't just tie him to a stretcher and drag him around, it would save everyone yelling 'FRODO!' All the time.  Some wag in the audience picked up on this and yelled out 'FRODO' At least three times. He totally cracked me up and from then on I was gone.  Everything made me laugh.  Gandalf's hat.  The Elve's hairy feet.  That Robbie Coltrane look-alike with the braided beard crying and banging his head on the altar. That neon door in the mountain that looked like one of those boutiques down the UK's King's Road.  Those sea horses straight out of that bear commercial.  There's something killingly funny about the word 'Mordar' for some reason, too.  I've never had a giggle attack like this before during a film and It's painful trying to hold it in so as not to disturb your neighbours. I tried hurting my hand to distract myself like Micheal Caine in 'The Ipcress File' only to be confronted by a hysterical conference of Elves and Hobbits in a village over who should destroy the ring.  They gurn, they snarl, they get a camera up their nostrils.  Someone delivers the immortal line: 'Never trust an elf' Someone help me, I'm dying.  There's also a chap called Legola.  Well, he does look a bit plastic.  Does Legola get his leg over?  Is there a shire of wenches?  Sadly, women don't get much of a look in during the film.The plot staggers on and more gut busting dialogue insues.  'Yonder, see Iceguard!' 'We shall go forth to Loftylorry!' I regain my composure after a bit of aggro in a mine.  Later, Brit actor Sean Bean falls over in some leaves and begins sobbing 'FRODO!FRODO!' Please no, not that name again. I'm off.  This time some of the audience joins me.  Believe me, if your bereaved, in the middle of a divorce or depressed, this film will save you, it's a laugh riot.Suddenly Rawhead Rex turns up.  Once relegated to straight to video, he has finally made it to the big screen.  You can't keep a good bad guy down, I guess.  Rawhead Rex's appearance leads to a really funny death scene in which a character falls down mortally wounded, gets up again and fights, falls down mortally wounded again, gets up and fights, falls down again, gets up and fights.  Is he secretly related to Frodo?  The audience is really cracking up now, it's the comedy of the year.  Another chap called Sam has a swim but is saved.  'I'm glad you're with me, Sam' Frodo tells the dripping Hobbit, but we're far from glad as he's the one whose been yelling 'FRODO!' The entire film.Boy, three down, six hours to go.

28 Weeks Later," NO ESCAPE? Try the door marked 'EXIT'
","The opening scene plays like the climax, as if they muddled the reels. It is so terrifying that you know they cannot possibly follow it. Unfortunately, it is also confusingly shot, which did not bode well for the rest. Like SUNSHINE, I had no clue what was happening most of the time. Why do filmmakers do this? Another miscalculation is the characterization. The original saw the world through the eyes of one individual. The sequel begins with one individual who is not sympathetic then shifts to Jurassic park kids who are less relatable. These children are forced to witness such brutal scenes, not least an unnecessarily explicit torching, that it is a turn off. The original actually had only two really violent scenes. Danny Boyle wisely pulled his punches for the rest of the picture so as to let the human drama breathe. His film had a heart. The sequel parades its heart in a token way before plonking it on a blooded sideboard so as to get on with gratuitousness. Apparently, a sequel has to have more, more, more. I think less is always more. The producers think we want another eye-gouging, but that worked in the original because it was delivered to someone unsympathetic to the audience. The sequel is about nastiness for the sake of it.The script has not an idea in its head, even resorting to a redundant lift from 'The Silence of the Lambs'. I presume the inclusion of so many Americans is due to the original's success in the States. I like the idea of America colonizing Britain but nothing is really done with the idea. Only the opening scene lingers uncomfortably in the memory. This really is a poor film.If you see Dick Wittington outside the cinema, tell him: 'Turn back, Turn back!'",Null,5,11,12 May 2007

As if he would casually destroy property like that when he's got so little to pass the time with. Ah, but little did we know.....It's hard to believe this notorious el floppo is nearly twenty years old now but it I remember it was rather fascinating at the time. And there was a memorably silly hat, too. The science is dumb. How can an organism imitate a life form exactly and still retain it's own original identity and intelligence? If the thing's cells have changed into a dog's, how can it suddenly change into one of a million different life forms from a million planets at a moments notice? Where are those cells stored after a perfect simulation? And if it is a perfect simulation it should die if it has a heart attack in human form, not keep going and changing. Blair trashes the radio room in a fit of pique shouting, 'no dog makes it a hundred miles in this terrain. No, that thing wanted to be US!' But why couldn't the thing turn into a more weather resistant monster out of it's million life forms rather than trying to be a warm blooded mammal that freezes to death easily?Carpenter was once a master of suspense, but this film marked the turning point and is curiously flat at exploiting the possible tensions between the men. It looks like it had been a difficult and troubled shoot and the script does not help. My favourite cringe-making line: 'Do you buy any of this Voodoo bulls**t, Blair?' For an intelligent creature, the thing's behaviour is baffling. If that shadow early on in the film when the dog is stalking the rooms was Norris and by his hair shape it looked like him, why didn't he take over McCready and Doc when they went off together on the second trip to the Norwegian camp? It was a perfect opportunity. Likewise, he is left alone with Chiles and Gary who are tied to a sofa and at his mercy. He could have taken them over through their faces without damaging their clothes like he did to Gary in the final scene in the boiler room. The others were outside in the snow so they wouldn't have heard the screams. Also, Norris was given the early opportunity to be the leader but inexplicably turned it down. It would have given the thing a perfect chance to divide and conquer. Other daft moments include Blair building a mini saucer out of chopper spare parts. As if. Also the stupid moment when a blood sample suddenly acquires a mouth and shrieks. The blood on the floor runs away squeaking like mice as if blood has 'brains' as well as vocal cords. The average Bugs Bunny cartoon has more credibility. And did you notice that at the climax in the boiler room, the thing shoots up through the floor and instead of instantly attacking McCready it just sits their showing off a few heads, allowing McCready time to blow it up? And they wonder why films bomb. Having an ending that makes the audience feel cheated doesn't help, they like to think all that effort wasn't in vain but I rather liked not knowing if one of them was the thing.Despite all that it's still goofy fun and Carpenter has that ability to tap into that unnerving satanic atmosphere of his. Anyway, if you hate this review you can always console yourself with these words:'Are you going to listen to Gary? I mean, he could be one of those things!'",Null,0,1,23 July 2000
Pitch Black," Paint it black
","I love a good cliche. Like, 'we'll head 'em off at the pass.' Someone got their foot shot off in a Mel Brooks movie just for uttering it. So this film gets off to a good start by having the captain of the spaceship  blow up. And the ship's entire supply of toilet paper? Ooh, that's a tempting one, but we'll have to cross off a few more prominent cliches first, like frenetic cutting which makes the first ten minutes confusing. Who's who and who's where? This sort of constant controlling of the eye dissipates tension through out the film.Apparently, the crew have crashed on a desert planet that looks like the Australian outback. So why are so many characters moaning when they have Australian accents? They should feel at home, as should the commander who has the useful surname of 'Fry'. But they do moan, because aliens are going to eat them. Which is another cliche not unlike having an escaped psycho on board. Riddick (for it is he) is played by Vin Diesel who apparently used to be a bouncer. There's a lovely bit where Riddick does a Sumo wrestling dance with an alien who has a blind spot. Now, if it was Mr Diesel himself in this unseemly predicament he could have used his full ammunition : 'I'm sorry, Sir, members only. You don't have the right attitude' which is yet another cliche, but useless with aliens. Mr Diesel never finds his character possibly due to the film's blind spot, the script. Instead, he takes an idiosyncratic but not terribly convincing approach which involves looking enigmatic while hitting the same monotonous note over and over again in a gruff voice which makes me think of, well, a night club bouncer: 'You can't come in, mate, it's aliens night' which is a coincidence but not a cliche. And speaking of cliches, jailbird psycho's can't just be psycho's anymore, they have to have a bit of breeding and be a bit brainy and existential like Nietzsche (the only philosopher ever to have had a preservation order placed on his beard). I was just waiting for Riddick to say 'That which doesn't kill me makes me stronger!' It's a cliche that's only being used 2348 times in films like this and I was rather looking forward to it crash landing again. It doesn't, so black mark, writer. Next mistake and It'll be a pitch black mark and then you'll be sorry. We are led to believe that a convicted murderer who has vowed to leave the planet would risk all over a bit of intellectual curiosity over the mind of Ms Fry.Never mind, the aliens are fun. In his 'Austin Powers' films, the comedian Mike Myers sent up the fact that the British have bad teeth. I looked at the alien's choppers and then looked at mine in the mirror and he's not wrong about that cliche. But how will the stranded crew, psycho in tow, deal with the aliens during an eclipse so pitch black that you can see the black and ethnic characters even better than the whites? (Don't ask me how, I'm still trying to figure it out). There's an empathy problem here. Amongst the crew, there is a whining Englishman who protests he's meant to die in Paris (anyone who shares my aversion to French films will understand his deeply held belief) and a man who loses two sons without batting an eyelid in grief. I mean, if he doesn't care why does the director expect us to? To be fair, he does get a bit miffed when the third son cops it but perhaps he was a favourite and the others owed him money. Either way, he's a funny chap who, despite being Islamic, speaks vaguely about 'God' rather than Allah, which is perhaps the source of all his misery on the planet.The last quarter is rather gripping as the survivors make a last desperate dash along a canyon. Will they make it or will the aliens (wait for it, wait for it) head them off at the pass? It's worth a rental to find out as the visuals are very pleasing in that DVD way and the ending is moving and Christian despite not being entirely convincing in terms of credible motivations. The film makers want us to relate to Riddick's road to Damascus like conversion (actually, didn't that end in pitch black, last time?) Never the less, I think the relatives of the pilot he killed would rather he did a bit of time in a cell somewhere. Preferably pitch black. But he turned out cuddly enough for us to maybe toss in a few glow worms.The producers miss out on that grand cliche of them all, the rock song play out. Okay, pitch black mark. They should have had Mick Jagger and friends wailing over the end titles. Which song? Now come on, there can be only one. Yes, I know it's been used before, but what are cliches for?",Null,1,1,13 August 2001
American Beauty," Fourth time lucky?
","Someone borrows Lester Burnham's pen and doesn't give it back! So he kills everyone in sight until he gets a pen (whether it's his or not.) Suddenly the house is invaded by gay vampires. Lester fells them with a single quote from Bertrand Russel. Then he does his tax audit. Now that's what I call a plot! But we mustn't mention the plot. Even when there isn't one worth mentioning.(What's the quote? I'll tell you when you're older, it's disgusting.)",Null,1,1,15 February 2000
American Beauty," *SPOILERS*
","I suspect the reason this film is so awful is due to studio politics and the compromises that have to be made in order to get projects off the ground in an increasingly prohibitively expensive medium.  Certainly the director Sam Mendes had to abandon his first attempt, probably because the script is such piffle it's hard to make it work.  He gave it his best shot though, fair enough. This isn't the truth about America, it's one script writer's view of his audience and judging by his CV he has not done a great deal other than work in sitcom, which says a lot about the structure, approach and choices made in this film.  Trite scenes such as the throwing of the plate (queue canned laughter) and Bening's unconvincing behaviour in selling a house for instance.  Nothing works or convinces, especially the fatuous notion that a father should be murdered for 'ignoring' his sibling. I suspect the writer threw in other stuff garnered from 'Sex, Lies And Video Tape' and a tasteless who-dunnit element in an attempt to make the picture seem familiar and entertaining for the audience.  The bottom line was always money, not profundity.I think I'm right in saying Geffin had a hand in backing this film and there has been talk recently of a 'gay clique' in Hollywood and it's influence on the film-making process. I don't know if that's the case here but the gay couple are signalled straight away as being the happiest.  The film also plugs the usual gay propaganda that anyone who dislikes gays must automatically be in the closet.  The scene where such an alleged person punches his son full in the stomach for touching a plate is particularly unconvincing and pernicious.  The portrayal of the wife and women in general all seems to come from a certain questionable perspective.The so-called spiritual element about the nature of beauty produces an unbelievably laughable scene involving a bag.  One character looks at the blood matter of a brain with a hippy dippy stare that seems to say 'Wow man, it's so bea-u-ti-ful!' I cannot believe anyone takes these preposterous contrivances with dead birds and the like seriously.  It's palpable nonsense.All this huffing and puffing just for a reactionary 'Wizard Of Oz' homily about a family picture and 'there's no place like home.' The film then fobs you off with some sentimental voice-over guff about leaves and the loss of youth.  As the camera pulls back over suburbia and the patronising final sentiments are spoken, I get the impression that someone's behind the screen giggling 'My God, are they really BUYING all of this?' Only the sheep.The reality is that America has oppressed a large number of weaker and poorer countries over the last three decades in the guise of fighting Communism.  Very few people seem to be aware of the real horror that has gone on in central America and America's hand in it and the third world in general, and at the expense and loss of life of some of the poorest in those societies.  America is not the evil of the world but in the light of this enormous suffering and loss of an experience that only comes once to us all, are we really expected to care about the facile 'sufferings' of Burnham and his wife and their arguments about damaging the sofa?  Americans love this film because very few of them have suffered real injustice in their lives, the kind you suffer if you're born in Sudan, for instance.  A price has been paid for such comforts and Americans should be grateful for the lives they have, and not whinge.  Materialism does not necessarily mean the loss of inner worth or the ability to deepen one's world.  Many have been freed to pursue personal expression, such as making drivel like this film.  We should all be grateful for what we have in the time we have left, which in the face of increasing super-technology weapon attainment, may not be long.American Beauty's sincerity is disingenuous.  It's purpose is to make Americans feel safe and good about themselves so that the people behind it will be successful and make money.  There is a machine that has to be fed and a huge amount of talent-less people are out there figuring out increasingly desperate ways to do just that. 'American Beauty' incapsulates all that is glib, meretricious and plain wrong about modern cinema and as such is, in my opinion, one of the very worst films ever made.",Null,0,0,5 January 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Stinker
","When I left the cinema, a group of people were discussing how bad this film was. Super-ultra-cosmically bad? Badder than the baddest thing you've ever seen, then even more bad? And it got me thinking (rare event this, but) and intrigued. How do you define badness?  And how would your criteria stand up when confronted by the monumental badness that wallops you in this film? And that's before we even get on to the concept of 'it's so bad it's good.' And goodness knows this is bad. Would your bad-ometer explode thus forcing you to re-define badness again? Is it badder than that Christmas you once had with the Andersons? Or that time you were first introduced to your girlfriend's parents while you were going through that Nazi tea-shirt phase? Have you seen Ally McBeal? Imagine watching the entire first series back to back and it still won't even come CLOSE to the rankness that is T2.This film looks like a bunch of high school kids got to together to guess what the sequel to the terminator might look like maybe. Not once does it seem like a real film. It's horribly self conscious, like we know we're a bunch of actors on the set of the terminator sequel. And we're nudging and winking (I said WINKING!) to one another. And it's bad. It's really bad. Put your gas masks on. Not you, Edward Furlong. Your hairs so long that it covers your face so you wouldn't smell anything anyway. Which is just as well, as you were actually IN the bloody thing. Which was bad. But I've said that already. Wait, Arnold's talking. Or torking. Ged too da chuuppeeer! Heylo, ife kom to si Seeayraa Cuunniirr, Iyam towld she eeez heeyur. Kun I see er, pliz? I want $20m to star in this sequel. Ah, you said that clearly enough, didn't you? Can you hear me through this mask?Why is this film so blue? I haven't seen so much blue since I went to that flea pit in Holland with Eva (not her real name) to see 'I am curious, yellow.' I know artist's traditionally go through a blue period, but Cameron's a hack, not an artist. Also, what about the unlikeliness of a sudden huge leap in technology resulting in a new robot while sending an old dud model first to get Seeayra Cuunniir. The new robot is ridiculously far-fetched, as if tiny parts could seperate and somehow remake themselves at will. So daft. But we do get a glimpse of the future and it's blue. Did you know that blue and bad both start with a B? Nort a lodda peeeypowl know dat. Just our luck, the Anderson's probably have survived being lazer-zapped too.And then there's the hypocrisy of the violence which deems it okay to blow the kneecaps off people instead of killing them, to assuage the critics of the first film (and joke about it too) and also not to upset the more mainstream audience this is aimed at. Money, money, money. At least the brutality of the first film was honest as it was not trying to sell dolls to youngsters. And, oh dear, the script. Cameron has to have his little jokes, no matter how much they defy logic and remind you you're just watching a film. Like the robot saying, 'I need a vacation!' I suppose some Sci-Fi nut out there will tell me that the robot has suddenly understood the concept of humour after spending so long exposed to humans, they've got an answer for everything. Except badness. The last line of the picture is a pompous, not to mention fatuous little bromide too. Did you know that bromide and badness both begin with....?I heard there's an even longer version of this film. Is it still going on? There might even be a super-ultra-director's cut. Arnie comes back as a Mormon, or something. Is Kyle Reece still floating around up there? Kyle? How blue is it up there? Blimey, I've just been hit by bird sh*t.

Apocalypse Now," He's up
","He's really up. Francis is up sh*t creek without a paddle, that is. This is just around the time one of Hollywood's greatest talents began vanishing up his own jacksy with a bloated and meretricious would-be adaption of a Conrad novel that doesn't make sense in translation. The sound of copter blades hiding the sad sound of an old hippy jerking off and all at sea. Or in this case the Jungle. He is of course brave and visionary to risk all in order to pursue his dream project and I couldn't do any better in a million years but still.....When I was at school all the kids were drawing copters and writing 'death from the skies' which tells you all you need to know about this comic book of a film. Full of self parodic quotable dialogue and pretentious arty flourishes we are subjected to silly scenes such as Martin Sheen emerging from the swamp to lightning flashes, the type that only seem to exist in films and then he runs around to not terribly dramatic effect to some old Doors song. It's meant to be deep or something. Rock and Roll war but filmic bore. All this wouldn't be so offensive if there actually wasn't an interesting story to be told behind all this. But we mustn't talk politics must we? Let's bung on some war paint and deal in abstracts about man the animal and taking orders from the jungle or some other tosh. Self pity pervades this expensive but risible project. Drop tons of bombs on an impoverished people, kill maybe a million and then they want us to say, 'Ahhh, poor Vietnam vets.' It is indeed tragic that so many men were drafted into this violent fiasco but lets get some perspective on the whole thing. The fact that the helicopters used in the making of this film in the Phillipines were called away by another dictator to bomb more poor people aptly illustrates the twisted priorities of film folk.Another laughable aspect of this loathsome picture was the indulgence's afforded the method actors as shown in the documentary film shot while it was being made. That's it, let's just let Martin Sheen get plastered and watch him find his own personal heart of darkness. It'll be good for the film and yield a different angle to....to....no, on second thoughts it's piffle. And to get to the truth of what really happened in Vietnam let's sit around for two days with an overweight, allegedly fornicating recluse asking him questions like 'why are you in Vietnam?' He'll have the answers. He's the greatest something or rather ever. Then we'll draft in John Milius wearing antlers to do whatever he does with his NRA gold card to macho heaven while surfing to the biggest bank that he can fit past the doorway into.

Control," No thanks
","I thought this was a dreadful film but then I've never liked Bio-Pics because they can never capture the charisma of the original performers. I did like the Glenn Miller one and the Buddy Holly Story but even with that, Holly's wife said their courtship was laughably inaccurate in its portrayal. So what's the point? Is this social realist/ kitchen sink drama? In which case, why all the inaccuracies? I remember us all listening to that EP where Joy Division first appear (I think as Warsaw.) We kept playing the opening: 'You all remember Rudolf Hess?' over and over again as it sounded so dodgy, what with the band's alleged 'reputation'. I'm pretty sure the song that follows is 'A Later Date', not 'Leaders of Men.' But maybe that wasn't the case in reality. And I seem to remember the bassist telling the story of how Rob Gretton became their manager and it was nothing like the macho confrontation depicted. Just the opposite, to an amusing degree. And the band confessed the 'blood letter' was apocryphal. Does any of this matter? Well, according to the critics you would think 'Control' is the second coming of Tarkovsky. But there is no such poetry here as the director is a photographer turned director. Film is another discipline altogether, and the crucial failing is that Joy Division arguably have that mysterious mojo called 'artistic talent', while the director's lack of it sticks out like a sore thumb on the screen. Why did he want to make this film? I was left none the wiser, and I heard yawns around me.Do we need art? Is it in any way essential? Maybe the film is not interested in the question. The really uncomfortable aspect of 'Control' is we know the outcome, and the songs are merely box after box to be ticked as they bring you ever closer to that event. Really quite dreadful to sit through. The whole minute by minute depiction of the tragedy was unpleasant and unnecessary, at least to me. Yes, it was sad but is this helping? The final shot was particularly repulsive and seemed to allude to the controversy of their name and image, hardly touched upon in the film itself.

Mind you, the machete love letter was more than enough.I haven't hitherto had much time for Danny Boyle's stuff but he's directed brilliantly here, with some striking poetic images as the wandering team see the world around themselves in an increasingly new light. The film is surprisingly moving and emotional, with an interesting central conceit revolving around the male lead's rite of passage. Only the derivative nature of the proceedings ('Day Of The Dead' is borrowed heavily from) prevents it achieving classic status. The medium used is a help that also becomes too much of a hindrance. What a picture it might of been shot on film. It would probably be easier on the eye on a PC or small TV which rather defeats the purpose of cinema.The only other niggle is the Eccleston character's inexplicably dodgy aim at a vital moment.

Pride & Prejudice," Benighted remake
","In Austen speak, I can but hope that the circumstances in which I found myself during the film did nothing to bring ill favour upon my good opinion of it. The blue rinse brigade talk more in the cinema than your average teenage hoody. 'Who is that?', 'his cousin' , 'look at that dress', 'oh, a pig'. At least you can threaten kids. Any filmmaker that wants to make The Great Octogenarian Chainsaw Massacre will get my ticket stub. As it turned out, there was plenty to irritate by the film's own account.My main curiosity in seeing P&P again is whether it could possibly live up to my favourite scenes in the 95 Beeb production. Liz bennet's blistering refusal of Darcy's proposal and Lady Catherine De Bourg's incendiary assault in the apple orchard. As for the former, Darcy's opening words were drowned in thunderclaps. That's it, let's not bother with the dialogue. It's not important in an Austen production. IT'S THE TEMPEST OF THEIR INNER FEELINGS!!! Go, director. GO BABY! As for the latter, let's cut Lady Catherine's classic punchline. Who needs it?This version is curiously under-populated. It's use of passing light and shadow, mirror reflections and window blurrings suggests love as a waking dream of anticipation and uncertainty (no surprise when Darcy's big scene occurs at daybreak.) Although Austen's P&P has been said to be a comedy of manners, love as a moral force, in its ultimate sense as sacrifice, must also be of equal importance. The Wickham affair is central to it as Darcy is prepared to seriously humiliate himself before this man in order to win his true love. Without this he appears out of focus in the film, and the film without true gravity.The cast is okay although Hollander and Knightley appear to be using a certain production as a crib sheet. After the failure of Thunderbirds, perhaps hard nosed economics was the motivation behind Working Title's remake.

"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Genius performances in Italian black farce
","Very funny Italian film with a killer punchline. Heard the expression 'the scum always rises to the top'? Here the bureaucrats and middle managers of society are mercilessly lampooned. Seeing themselves as aristocrats and persons of taste and refinement, they fail hopelessly to get any cultural references right, let alone understand them. They also fail to stamp their authority on even the pathetic debauched party they've thrown, with their captives disobeying their rules for reasons of comfort or defiance. The look on their faces as a prisoner they've caught in flagrante delicto gives them the fascist salute is priceless and their uncomprehending response one of the great moments in the film. Ignoring the fact that the party has been a bit of a flop or too lazy and drunk to care, they are made to look ridiculous dancing in nightgowns and dresses swinging bull whips in their own banal concept of decadence.An obvious exaggeration and probably unfair, not to mention fantastically ideological and distressing, this is still a work of genius although Pasolini's belief that DeSade was a revolutionary now seems quaint.",Null,2,6,23 August 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Thanks for the memories
","Stanley Kubrick is a genius. I know this because we are told so by the advert for Mr Kubrick's website at the beginning of the rental video. And no adverts for other movies either, Stanley is much too much of a diety to be placed next to lesser efforts from mere mortals. But as far as I am concerned, Stanley (may I call you Stanley?) is not a genius because of his films which are frankly variable, but because he kept Tom Cruise off our screens for three years. This altruistic act alone should have seen him knighted. I am reliably informed by someone in the know that the reason Tom Cruise doesn't have to act is because he is the STAR of the picture he's been hired for. Well, you could have knocked me down with a feather. $20m just to STAR in the picture. Acting costs extra then. I am also reliably informed that 'The Shawshank Redemption' is the template by which everything in the known universe is measured against. If you don't like it then your critical faculties in evaluating whether Tom Cruise can act or not must be suspect. 'The Shawshank Redemption' comes from a great literary giant who writes about giant space spiders living in the sewers who also hold down day jobs as clowns. Blimey, I'm chastened. Now I know these great universal truths I can look at Cruise in a totally new light. Or without feeling nauseous, which would be a start. And it must have worked because Cruise is great in this film. He's just really funny. Not that he does any acting as such, it's a curious non-performance, but because the sheer incongruousness of good old American boy Cruise sleep walking around a bizarre european art flick is priceless to behold. The film is so weird that it's hard to tell whether he's actually good or bad. Nicole Kidman goes all out to convince us that she's awful, however, her arms flailing around like a brain damaged Dromedary. Hey, these two should get married. Anyway, you haven't lived till you've seen Cruise weeping to what sounds like a two year old banging random keys on a piano. They paid top dollar for this soundtrack. In fact, Cruise is cruelly stalked by a piano the entire film. He stands by the gate to a mansion for an interminable length of time and up and down the scales plinks that toddler until Cruise receives a letter from a mysterious valet. There's alway's a mysterious valet in a Kubrick movie. Cruise looks bemused, and we share his confusion. I think he needs to lie down, take a stress pill and think things through. I've always suspected that Stanley had a wicked sense of humour and this whole film comes across as an arch and knowing parody of art house drivel while simultaneously playing a practical joke on one of Hollywood's biggest stars. The film has the usual irritating wide-angle lenses and ornamental interiors and numbing atmospherics bordering on inertia we expect of our Stanley. But boredom soon gives way to laughter, thank God. More fun can be had spotting British landmarks passed off as American, as our Stanley famously did not like to travel abroad. We've had palm trees in the docklands and boot camps in surrey. Hang on a minute, I recognise those revolving doors from somewhere. Sure enough, it's the Kensington and Chelsea hospital, although it's supposed to be New York. I've been to the mental Health unit there many times. I tell them that I'm Tom Cruise and that I can act and six orderlies wrestle me to the ground administering anti-psychotic medication.  Also the last scene in Hamley's toy store looks just like the one in Regent's Street. So you see, you can never get bored watching a Stanley Kubrick film. The biggest shock was seeing the orgy scene which to my astonishment was filmed in my house. That will teach me to leave the kitchen door unlocked. At least it explains those funny stains on the carpet. It's a shame Kubrick didn't leave the orgy scene as an enigma. He ruined the surreal and whacky atmosphere of the picture by taking it literally.What can I say, this is a wonderful, wonderful film to go out on. Definately one of the all time funniest ever made, especially the very final line which is a killer. It had me doubled up and rolling around the floor in hysterics. Which is just as well as I needed to look for my contact lenses. I always take them off before a Tom Cruise film but not anymore. Tom Cruise is God, official. And Stanley Kubrick is a genius. Thanks for the memories, mate.",Null,0,0,27 August 2000
The Descent," Don't sit too near the front
","Like I did. Despite horror films being a touch old hat, the jumps in The Descent are by no means as predictable as expected. I was too old to see this movie but I bribed the management into giving me a ticket. It is about some girls who go potholing in the Apelican mountains. There are no pelicans, I just can't spell Appalachian. The director's last film failed because the budget did not extend to actually having special effects. A hairy dummy which I took to be a werewolf was jigged up and down by a window by a prop person while the camera was flung about in attempt to fool us into thinking the wolf was something other than an inanimate object. By that point I was nodding off causing even more jitters. This time the director was able to afford monsters but made them look like Orcs from Lord of the Rings. What is Lord of the Rings? Well it's about a mythical kingdom called Middle Earth that is populated amongst other things by little people called Hobbits and a wizard called Gandalf and there's this ringno, best not. Anyway, it is one of a curious number of decisions, such as beginning the opening scene with quick cuts like his last film. This meant I almost entirely missed a plot point about an affair which I only 'got' when belatedly reading a review. Confusingly he has also hired two actresses with identical boat races. It was also unwise to pull the rug on sympathy for his lead actress. A film this bleak really needs someone to unambiguously root for, rather than frown upon for moral reasons. I also noticed the odd out of focus shot and the climatic fight was botched to say the least. None of this is ruinous, however. I would say that the only glaring fault is the running time. Eighty five minutes tops, please, for movies that have the intellectual content of a grape. The enigmatic ending seemed contrived to create a buzz for the film on Internet message boards. Mission accomplished.So to sum up, The Descent is slightly above average. It is depressing and pointless but then so are the last few Woody Allen films so it's Hobson's choice really. Anyone wishing to corner the director into explaining the ending should look for a bald gentleman with fangs standing in an airport departure lounge, clutching a one way ticket to LA. I'm not jealous.",Null,2,6,16 July 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," So-so
","Apparently this is loved by young people. Have you met them, the young? Think Stephen Dorff and then knock off a centimetre. Twas a book, now 'tis film, squire. The school game Spinach or whatever threatens to bring the film to life after a long wait and has a great other-wordly quality to it. It doesn't last. Just when, like the kids, you are settling into your surroundings you are suddenly confronted with the uncomfortable fact that boarding school is a little mundane and plodding. It all starts to go a bit pear shaped when 'Da kids' discover a secret room with a large three headed dog in it. According to their rotund chum Hadrig, he was bought from an Irishman. Presumably this was changed from a Greek because the producers thought the adults wouldn't get the reference. What is surprising is that as soon as the kids open the door they are not immediately immersed in a mountain of 'naughty Fido's'. I think they call it a plot hole. Of course, it could be the world's biggest and most constipated dog. With three heads there must be a lot of food going in and a lot needing to go out. Perhaps this is why Fluffy (for it is he) just stands there and easily lets the threesome escape. Any movement in the back legs is severely curtailed by a huge weight in the nether regions. Perhaps in some future movie Hermoine can deliver a spell that will put the poor beast out of it's misery and I'd love to see the pooper scooper. They'll probably need a crane. Speaking of plot holes, I was also puzzled as to why the family of 'muggles' would give up home comforts for a dodgy gaff in Inverness or somewhere for a foster kid they dislike and presumably would be more than happy to see the back of for several terms. Anyway, the dog is more amenable than a troll who stomps through the school presumably in search of a room with Internet access. The last half of the movie has problems cinematically, being rather static tableau that is, dare I say, a tad dull. Perhaps this sort of thing works better on the page. I suspect school rivalry is more appealing to kids than this darklord stuff, but I don't know. Overall, 'Harry Potter' seems dark and stilted like 'The Phantom Menace'. Films today lack the fun of say 'Bed knobs And Broomsticks' which is easily the superior film, in my rose tinted view. Also, staff putting kids in harms way to fight evil wizards seems distasteful. They should do the job themselves but teachers are over worked nowadays. Too much bureacracy. Too many papers to mark. Either way, school inspectors need to investigate this dodgy place immediately, Britain can ill afford another scandal.Robbie Coltrane: 'When I took the role in 'Harry Potter', my kids sat me down and told me I had better be careful to get my character right. They warned me that kids would write and let me know if I wasn't successful. Boy, talk about pressure.' Well, you can rest easy Mr Coltrane. You're easily the best thing in it.",Null,0,0,16 November 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Boring and interesting, if that's possible
","An ambitious film that takes four years to make and with so many different elements will inevitably suffer a certain disjointedness.What saves this film and it's predecessor, which I was not too enamoured of, is it's interesting plot. Throughout history, totalitarian states have grappled with the problem of controlling it's slaves and their rebellions. This film dares to devote a lot of screen time in an almost academic way to the complex problems an advanced technological machine culture would have dealing with it's slave labour, giving a strange poignancy to the helplessness of the humans crushed by these cold machinations. The result is a boring, weird and brilliant film. I am certainly intrigued as to how the story will be concluded, hopefully in an original way and not a banal shoot-em-up. we shall see.",Null,0,0,23 May 2003
Enemy at the Gates," What a handle and door
","*SPOILERS*This film's a laugh. Love the voice over and dodgy graphics showing a spinning earth and red pouring over the globe until we hit Stalingrad with a DAN-DAN! Over the soundtrack. The first thing that grabs you by the Niagra's is the English accents. It's 'Eastender's' with more guns and less blood.The film begins at the dock and a figure emerges from a submarine. Blimey, it's Bob Hoskins *giggle*. How are you, me old Cockney SPARRAH? Diamond geezer and all that, but what's he going to say? 'I've put Vodka in all your pockets. I've treated you reds well even when you was out of order. Now, there's been an ERUPTION!' The ruck in question is between two heavy firms fighting for their Eastend Stalingrad turf and Bob is here to give his firm a good kick up the Aris. Stalingrad is Gypsy Nell at the moment, what with the red army cream crackered and the bombing making them all Mutt and Jeff. Everyone is in dire need of a Chas and Dave and a nice warm Steffi. Commisar Danilov, in a poncy public school accent straight out of 'Another Country', suggests Bob uses a China plate of his called Vassili Zaitsev for propaganda purposes. Vassili, whose in Stalingrad via sarf London, is a crack shot and when he's around everyone has to hit the Posh and Becks. His nemesis is a rainbow trout called Erwin Konig whose a bit of a roll and butter, although tasty with a custard and trifle himself. I've seen some performers in my time, but he enjoys his work. For the duration of the film, Zaitsev and Konig crawl around the ruined city on their biscuits and cheese trying to off each other. But Zaitsev has lost his bottle and is getting cold plates of meat over his mythical status. He tells his mate Commisar Danilov that he's not so lemon dash and asks him to ship his Khyber Pass to another firm altogether. But Danilov is under pressure himself. Bob Hoskins has been sent by uncle Joe 'the tache' himself and tells Danilov they cannot lose Chevy Chase over this. If Zaitsev doesn't deliver the goods he hints they'll both get a bullet in their pants and vest. In a splendid bit of over-acting Danilov tells Zaitsev that he has total 'FAIIIITH!' In him.Just when things are complicated enough along comes this posh bird called Tania Chernova who likes a bit of rough. Her plummy accent is a scream. Quickly, Zaitsev falls head over heels in turtle dove with her and they soon get down to a bit of rumpy pumpy in the ruins amongst a row of sleeping soldiers. Her mince pies bulge so much it's hilarious. Is a large uncle Bob causing her problems or are Zaitsev's feet a bit potatoes in the mould? But Danilov has had his eyes on Tania's Gregory Peck in a previous scene, and seeing her as more his class, decides she should be his Richard the Third instead. So out of sheer read and write, Danilov grasses his mate up to the firm accusing him of disloyalty. Now, you may think these porkies makes him a bit of a strawberry split, but he redeems himself in the end.
Meanwhile, stuck in the ruins of Stalingrad, Zaitsev gets some news which makes him go a bit radio rental. He's Schindler's list over the whole sorry situation and decides it's time to put his money where his north and south is. He can't leave it any Christian Slater so he goes to face that three card trick Konig all Jack Jones. Whose run out of Frair Tuck and ends up brown bread?This film is quite the biggest load of pony and trap I've seen in quite a while. It is excrutiating to sit through. The acting pen and inks and the script belongs in the biscuit tin. The director should have got the hammer and tack after the first day. Howlers abound, like the appearance of Kruschev and the endless music with bits of 'Schindler's List' floating in and out. Ron Perlman plays a soldier who slags off the communist system in a way that would have had him shot in the real war. I bet Russians are having a real laugh over this picture and the  war was no laughing matter for them. If you haven't seen it then spend your money on something useful like guide dogs for the blind. I know who should be first in line for one.",Null,0,0,20 August 2001
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," The man who...
","When one of us interns at boarding school saw this when I was a kid and told us about it, he couldn't remember Nicholson's name in the film, so long-windedly described him as 'the man who wields all the powers' which is accurate but my god, it made an already protracted film seem endless. None of us did the obvious thing and say to him, 'look, just call him NICHOLSON.' That proves conclusively that Brad Doruff is no crazier than the average arsehole walking the streets.Kirk Douglas wanted to make and star in this film originally because he saw 'the man who wields all the powers' as a Christ figure. This is a popular sentiment among many that is inexplicable and silly to me. Christ believed one should help others without thinking of a reward. 'The man who wields all the powers' thought only of himself and what he could con out of the system. He stimulated the people around him but that doesn't make him a saint as it was accidental, not by design. He didn't give a damn that when he stole the fishing boat, any one of the patients could have got seriously hurt or gone overboard and got lost at sea.This film meanders on too long and the last quarter is nasty stuff. 'The man who wields all the powers' doesn't give a damn once again that mentally incapable people may drown on their own vomit after getting them plastered on booze. Are we meant to find it funny that drink was funneled down their throats? A Christ figure? People are so deluded.The portrayal of psychiatric staff was also unfair, representing 'the state' and conformism over the susposedly admirable individuality and freedom (to exploit others) of 'the man who wields all the powers.' I think they did the best job they could with the perceived psychiatric wisdom of the day and is order so bad when you consider the reckless endangerment of others by the 'man who wields all the powers?' Nurse Ratched's tragic threat to Billy was ill considered, even reprensible but does that make her the monster she was portrayed? We are all human and anyone can lose their temper when confronted with the endangerment of patients and the destruction of property which she would be held accountable for and her staff would have to take long hours clearing up. Obviously, one has to accept the picture in the liberal, counter-culture context of the times but although it was well acted, it was neither a great or distinguished piece of film making.",Null,1,3,2 February 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Average at best
","This is another of those films that inexplicably gets the reputation of being the best film ever made and a kind of rabid mass psychosis by suggestion seems to result. I'm amazed at the number of times this turns up whenever people do a top ten list. Unfailingly, like the proverbial black penny, up it pops. Yawn. I think kids need to be forcefully tied to a chair and made to watch some film history. Why on earth does every single thing Stephen King inflicts on the reading public have to be made into a film? They'll be making his shopping list next. It would be okay if he was an interesting author but the majority of what he turns out is handed down pulp detritus. This film is a staggering three hours long and full of cliched bathetic corn although freeman does his best. Robbins is an average actor and his character is a cypher at best. The plot is very silly. Are they really trying to tell us that no one would check a very prominent item in a cell for fifteen years? There must have been a lot of noise filtering through and a draught which would rattle it like mad. I'm sure that's the first place they'd check behind for a marijuana stash. And didn't prisoners get moved around regularly from cell to cell? The come-uppance of the staff was hugely unlikely too, destroying any poignancy and good will the film may have stirred up earlier. It was daft stuff. And we mustn't forget the old stalwart of hack directing, the thunderstorm to highten...well, I don't know what really, it's hard to see with all that flashing. I suspose it's stirring for some to see a crane shot of a man holding his arms to the heavens. It's a highlight of their lives. I call it film making by numbers. And there are a lot of numbers in this film. It's one virtue is it doesn't duck prison rape.",Null,1,1,11 February 2000
Carrie," Carrie-d out on a stretcher when I saw it as a kid
","Notorious 70's schlock noteworthy for it's abandonment of traditional Hollywood narrative and moral compass. The road to hell is paved as much by good intentions as by malicious ones. Art house flourishes towards the end hint at profundity but the cheque inevitably bounces due to the preference of a striking image over internal logic, moral or otherwise. This abandonment of rhythm and reason for off the cuff reasons is probably what makes the film disturbingly memorable. It's cheeky hijacking of the avante-garde in the service of the pop culture prerogative of making money makes it an undeniably magnificent piece of time wasting trash. De Palma's masterful arrangement of various disparate, not to mention preposterous elements from Stephen king's dire novel does not disguise the fact that without a good reason to emotionally distress his audience, he has made a thoroughly despicable piece of film making.",Null,0,0,20 November 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," All time worst (some spoilers)
","Oh goody gumdrops. A chance to express my utter hatred of this execrable and immoral film. I burst out laughing when it won oscars in all the film making departments in which I had found it so inept. Hackneyed dialogue, direction-by-numbers, corny music and silly performances make this one to remember. Hopkins gives a diabolical performance but not in the way you want. He was quite preposterous but, being a canny actor, he gave a cartoon turn very appropriate to the ridiculous plot. Take the money and run, eh Tony? The name 'Dr.Lecter' suggests a moriaty type evil genius which is wonderfully silly. The scene where he is wheeled along in restraints at the airport reminds me of an episode of Batman, a series noted at the time for its pantomime villains. I remember an 8 year old on tv saying this was her favourite film. We were supposed to be shocked that she'd even seen it but I thought: 'how appropriate'. That seems to be the mentality it was aimed at. But the real p***er is when Starling is led into a room where lecter is sitting in this ridiculously huge cage. Roll up, folks! Roll Up! Come and see the most dangerous man in the world! Then there's that crass scene where Lecter listens to classical music while murdering his guards. Hey, Mass murderers like Hitler listened to Wagner. Getting the message? Then the corny fifties way the police draw their revolvers and look at the descending lift arrow. 'He's coming down!' Notice the way the camera wobbles as it pans in. Bad. Then there's the naff B-movie dialogue. Jodie Foster saying the Plan 9-like line: 'who cut off your patient's head, doctor?' in that portentious southern twang never fails to give me the giggles. And what's the big psychological motivation that Sterling must divulge to Lecter which is susposed to rivet us to our seats with the great drama of it all? Aw shucks, she just wanted to save all those lambys from being slaughtered in her childhood. Blinding! Shakespeare! The way the film tries to make us laugh and side with Lecter at the end as he stalks his captor is sickening and speaks volumes about the moral bankruptcy of America. Hopkins described SOTL as 'that camp little picture' with a smirk. Jonathan Demmie nervously explained how many successful films were B-movies. What can you say about a film whose lead actor and director seem embarrassed by its success? I see a lot of reviewers of this film say it has inspired them to become psychology majors and 'profilers', whatever that means. Have fun, kiddies!",Null,19,54,7 January 2000
Blade Runner," Sorry to be boring but....(some spoilers)
","....at the beginning of this film why did Holden bother to use that gadget when all the replicants were clearly registered on a visual data base as shown in the scene in the police station? And they were actually AT the Tyrell Corporation. Why did Deckard go to all that trouble of getting a blurred, half picture of Zhora off a photo when he could have shown a perfectly clear picture of her off the same data base? And why didn't he just arrest her instead of posing as an investigater from the committee of moral abuses? He knew who she was. How did Roy Batty know Deckards name? They'd never met and Leon was too far away in noisy traffic to hear Deckard talking to his chief after he shot Zhora. Why, if Replicants were illegal on earth by penalty of death was Rachel allowed to wander the streets? Why would Deckard go in alone against two superhuman androids? In real life they'd call a SWAT team, throw in gas cannisters and storm the place. Instead he goes in and gets his arse kicked. Why did Pris run the full length of a room, thus giving Deckard time to get hold of his gun and shoot her? Would America, which fought a bitter civil war over slavery and is so obsessed with personal freedom that it allows it's own citizens to blow each other away with assault rifles; allow a sudden return to slavery of intelligent, lifelike androids? It's all terribly silly.And this business of Deckard being a replicant. How does that enhance the story? Replicants are illegal on earth, so they're unlikely to let him wander about even BEFORE he quit. And aren't replicants superhuman? Wouldn't he have noticed that hot water doesn't scald him? Daft.But it all works because of brilliant performances, art design and Ridley Scott's direction. After this you'd think he'd become one of the great auters but instead he ended up making routine fare like 'White Squal' with it's embarrassing court scenes. It always puzzled me that straight after Blade Runner he took the least interesting bit with some dwarfs and made a film around them.Apparently Ford didn't like the film but I suspect this was because Hauer stole the film from under him with a rivetting performance. It is unusual that the cop was the unsympathetic assassin and it's also unusual for the lead to disappear for a large section of a movie. I think a remake would be pointless as it couldn't top old Rutger's speech on the roof. Scott is said to be a fan of Tarkovsky's Solaris and I see a certain influence. The slow direction with a lot of action happening in real time rather than dictated by rapid cutting and pounding music. This slow pace lulled you into the brutal final confrontation unawares. Also the relationship with Rachel and the meditations on memory were reminiscent of Tarkovsky's film.I remember when I first saw this at the flicks everyone was taken aback at the brutal head crushing scene and were immediately on edge at what was going to hit them for the rest of the film. We left wondering why it had arrived in the UK so unheralded. Funny how some of the best films make the least money.",Null,0,0,31 January 2000

Gladiator," Good but not great, in fact...
",".....the more I think about it, mediocre. After so many duff movies since Blade Runner I was sceptical that Scott had suddenly become the great auteur we once expected of him after the afore-mentioned android epic. And so it proved. The direction is frankly awful in the first half. As an executive once said of 'Heaven's Gate', there is scene after scene of beautiful images, but no film. Too adverty, too many filters and irritating slow-mo. Curiously for an epic, Scott shoots a lot of the film in close up which does not work. How did Crowe escape execution in the wood? Damned if I could work it out. The close up and fast cutting of the fight scenes proves disastrous too. Why do it? Because it's in vogue, so forget personal directorial vision. Ben Hur is years old but the fight scenes here pale in comparison.Why did he choose to film the whole thing as if you are seeing Rome through light tinted sun glasses? Perhaps to create a disconcerting atmosphere of facism, but the overall effect is one of mental illness. Rome was sunny, that's why they managed to hold games for 120 days in a row. The constant squinting at sepia soon grows tiresome. The ending was moving but it's going to be if you cynically go for the film making by numbers approach. It's routine, push the buttons stuff. Why did he insist on having music playing in the background throughout most of the film? It's a comman complaint against documentaries at the moment and is distracting here as well. Just give us a sense of reality for a moment, please. The use of (I think) Holst's 'The Planets' is el naffo as well.Classy actors are used as window dressing. Crowe is one note. Despite the hype, Oliver Reed is given little to do. It's not a dead loss, the strange atmosphere is compelling, but there's a sense that contemporary film makers have forgotten how to tell a story and could care less. Check out Spartacus as a reminder. Great performances, especially Olivier, and a cracking script too. For those who want to see a proper historical epic, see Tarkovsky's 'Andrei Rublev.' It's awesome.",Null,0,0,28 May 2000
