Skyfall," Gesundheit - see Lockout to get well again
","I guess 'gesundheit' could be a proper reply to this gigantic *RIPOFF*.I have rarely seen so many ideas stolen from recent blockbusters in one place, at least not in a movie that had an actual budget itself.'Mission Impossible' 1-4 are better.'Die Hard' 1-4 are better. 'Batman' is better in all versions - EVEN INCLUDING 'Batman and Robin' and 'Batman Forever'.'Lockout' has Guy Pearce as a Bond that is Bond in anything but name, Skyfall has a Bond that is ONLY Bond in name.In fact, 'Lockout' is highly recommended if you want to have the consolation of seeing the REAL 50 years anniversary Bond.I wish the owners of the Franchise would understand and respect the tradition that is Bond - and thus fire Craig and hire Pearce for the future.As another user wrote: You don't reinvent the Bic Mac by removing the meat.",1,19,69,9 November 2012
