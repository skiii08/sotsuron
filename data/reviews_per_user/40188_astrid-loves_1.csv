Requiem for a Dream," shockingly real. and scary
","I actually went to the video store expecting to come out with a copy of SPUN, but it was hired out so the attendant suggested i should give this movie a try. I got home angry about my choice. But when I started to watch this movie I was like 'what the hell is going on' but as you watch it, it stabs you in the heart and leaves you wanting more. Just like the many drugs used in this movie REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is addictive. But for some strange reason this movie relates a lot to so many of my friends, constantly in the drug scene. So I guess if you don't know anything about drugs to begin with, you will get a massive shock. Because this is the utter truth. But it makes me really sad because, well I wont give away any plot lines but it just tears you inside to see these people wrecking themselves and how horrible and scary their lives become. Plus my heart races even more when you realize that not only do these for people have to go through so much trauma but these kind of things happen to so many people everyday. This movie had me on the edge of my seat wanting more of this shocking truth. so bring it on.",9,2,4,27 July 2005
