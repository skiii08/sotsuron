Hereditary," I feel like I let something bad in
","If you like a slow burn and to be completely freaked out. This is the movie for you. 
Very disturbing. To say the least. And the main character. Don't know her name, did an AMAZING job! She's crazy! And I loved watching all of her facial expression! 
I love to rewatch movies all the time. 
You know, put them on for background noise and that kind of thing.
Pretty sure that this movie will not be on the list.
I am glad I watched it. Because I was curious. And horror is my favorite genre. 
But...... I pass on a second view!",8,1,2,28 August 2018
Hereditary," I wish I could see it!!
",Really disappointed they took it out of our theaters already! I know I'll love this movie when it comes out in September on DVD.,8,0,3,5 July 2018
Us," Bummed
","Really wanted to like this movie.
I felt like I wanted to fast forward though the whole thing.
And the acting was pretty horrible.
The two little girls were the best.
Or should I say 4.
I'm not mad I watched it, but I'm glad it's over!",2,2,4,24 November 2019
Bird Box," It's Happening...Again
","Ugh! Didn't love it.
And haven't we already seen this story before. With Marky Mark and the cute New Girl?? I know it's a little different. But still.Well this movie drive me equally as nuts as the other one. I hate when people miss treat kids. No matter the reason. You just don't do it. So Instantly the way she was treating that sweet little girl put me right off!!Anyway, this movie is just one bad thing happening after another!! Non stop! Which I'm sure people love, but it drove me nuts!!Yes the acting was great.
Yes it's got a few pretty famous actors/actresses in it.
Yes it's a Netflix movie! Yay!!!!
But... come on already!! Can someone catch a freaking break every once in a while in a movie!?!?",5,0,1,3 January 2019
