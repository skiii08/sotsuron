War Dogs," It needed a few strippers, minimum.
","Yeah, that sounds pretty shallow -- but it's really quite an unsexy movie, both literally and figuratively.Some people deny the similarities both in intent and execution, but it really is impossible not to draw lines between this and 'Wolf of Wall Street' (2013). But where the latter is entertaining as heck, 'War Dogs' is surprisingly boring and low key. 'WoWS' serves up both bigger money, absurd trips on much harder drugs, and a truckload of absurdly attractive and for a large part naked women.War Dogs -- there's basically one woman in the entire movie, and barely any bit parts and extras to speak of. And this character, while played by a beautiful actress, is a whiny, pregnant, self-centered hypocrite (basically your typical modern Western woman).Oh, and there's actual comedy in 'WoWS'. This movie has almost none, and while that could be marketing's fault (the trailer promises an entirely different movie), at the end of the day it's just not very entertaining. It might be that the director's intention was simply to tell this 'true story' and convey the questionable politics that made it possible, but in that case they should've made a documentary, IMO.I don't think it's a bad movie, really -- just very, very forgettable compared to what you might expect from a cast like this.",Null,0,1,8 November 2016
