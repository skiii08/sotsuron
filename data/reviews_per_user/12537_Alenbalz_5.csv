The Monuments Men," Monumental Disappointment
","What a waste of talent, great potential of a story that should be told, with great actors, but lousy composition, script and directing. Certainly one of George Clooney's big flops. This needs to be re-made better. While it's based on true events, it really is a bit like the typical American/John Wayne movies, they are the good guys, out to 'save the world' and it's art from the Germans as well as the Russians (But lets not worry about the Thieving British and the Parthenon Marbles still in the British Museum). Great idea, but the storyline as depicted in the movie is rather disjoint and ridiculous: and very likely an embellished Hollywood account of actual events. A team of 8 scholars and museum curators, get some basic military training (and lets not worry about passing the army medical, or if some were close to retirement age) and are sent into enemy territory to track-down, identify and retrieve great works of art. Now if they were all given the rank of Major or above, they may have had better luck and support from their own forces, or better still assigned with a dozen 'real' soldiers to assist and protect them when they do encounter the enemy. As a movie it's all over the place, nothing really holds it together, just repetitive melodrama spread across about half a dozen missions. But it does make you think about the value of a life vs art, especially the difference between that of a German vs American soldier's life.",4,0,0,27 May 2014
John Wick," Not even John Wayne
","If you love fast paced action, where the hero recovers from numerous crippling assaults and stabbings, (that would kill any bad guy) faster than you can say Jack be Nimble... this is the movies for you. Story line is very very simple, acting mediocre, but fully action paced to the hilt. Our hero, kills at least 84 bad guys, including the 'Big Boss' and effectively takes out the whole Russian Mafia: All because the Big Boss' son kills his dog and steals his car. Our hero makes Superman, Batman and Spider-Man look like kindergarten babes as he wisks through more than 80 thugs and trained killers and underworld henchmen like a 300km/hr tornado. The movie starts off with our hero collapsing (you think he dies) due to a mortal stomach wound, then it flashes back to fill in the intervening events, and ends with our hero rising like a Phoenix out of the ashes, as good as new (almost) for what could only be a the first step towards a future sequel. After beating and killing over 80 trained and ruthless mobsters, our hero is given a very good hiding by a female assassin, just hours after he was patched up from a previous almost fatal beating and stabbing. and a day or two later, the only way he can disarm and beat a much older (and nowhere near as fit or capable as our hero) Crime Boss is to let the crime boss stab him in the pre-existing stomach wound so he could take the knife off him and stab/kill him; perhaps this is where our hero's batteries were running low.Though not all is far fetched fantasy because this is one of a very few movies where the hero's gun runs out of bullets as any normal gun would, and we do see him reloading a few times. Apart from the miraculous recoveries (more than once) of our hero, the movie does have some somber or comical scenes to break up the voluminous killings, like when our hero goes to a classy hotel (akin to a sanctuary or demilitarized zone, where only assassins, hit men and criminals are allowed entry, to gather, stay and unwind or just take a breather from their hectic routine), with very stringent rules where any transgression carries an immediate death sentence: as ones greedy guest discovers. And for the car enthusiasts, our hero does do some very impressive driving/pursuit scenes. Pity because with a bit of toning down on the outlandish stunts and super recovery from serious injuries, this could have been a much better film.",4,2,5,17 June 2015
Life of Pi," A Great thought provoking movie
","Fantastic photography, and a really entertaining storyline that has you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The director has added another feather to his cap of great cinematic achievements. Beautiful scenery and vivid colors, makes you marvel at the wonders of nature, some fantastic ocean storm waves, showing just how big and powerful the ocean really is. But let's not forget this is a fictional movie, and like the Superman or The Hulk etc etc, movies, it's very believable and engaging. In a broad sense, it's also a treatise about mans faith and belief in religion and a God, a personal vs an Abstract God, told allegorically; a boy on a life boat with some other survivors, depicted as wild animals, and towards the end of the movie alluded to be humans (and more specifically inhumane humans), all vieing for survival. It's left up to the viewer to choose which story-line they prefer to believe in: and the analogy to which religion/God they prefer to believe in. So if you can come way from a Superman or Batman movie without it challenging your faith and belief in the real world around you, this movie should be approached in the same way, with the added bonus, that you might view your relationship with reality and religion afresh.",8,2,5,29 May 2014
Gone Girl," Missing logic
","Interesting and engaging movie (emphasis is on Movie) exploring human relationships, brother/sister, parents/children, husband/wife, unfaithful husband/lover, wife/jilted lover, police/suspect, lawyer/client, media/audience. There's 3 parts to this movie, ie two unexpected twists, where it evolves from a simple missing person investigation to a clever and calculating revenge drama that transforms into a suspenseful perfect crime thriller. The Acting is excellent, the story line has a few holes that defy reality but moves along at an engaging pace and the ending is yours to write. Enjoy it as a well acted and entertaining movie.",8,0,0,29 April 2015
Insidious," In side the next dimesion
","A Rather clichéd and predictable below B grade horror movie. But I wouldn't really call it a horror movie. Some kid gets lost in a spirit dimension after astral traveling (out of body experience) Which we discover about 2/3 of the way into the movie,Of course, how or why would an innocent kid ends up in a demon infested 'other dimension' is not really clear. But then it's a horror movie right! So there's no way he'd end up in some happy fantasy land, full of lollies, ice cream and cakes. So the tired old theme of demons possessing the young and innocent Though in this movie, the kid isn't really possessed, just that his soul has wondered too far from his physical body and the panic that if he doesn't return soon, his physical body will be taken over by a demon, So where are all the angels, and why don't they ever take over a kids' body Such is the cliché of horror movies.A demon-mortal combat, where a mere mortal often outwits and beats the devil, Unless of course the producers plan on a sequel Then the demon wins, or survives to fight another day (i.e. act in another movie). And yes there's two sequels of this mediocre movie. Having said all that, there's worse out there, but I wouldn't rate this much above 4, 0nce again I got sucked in by the IMDb rating above 6. Perhaps I should watch some movies that have a rating under 4, Might find a gem.",4,0,0,20 January 2016
