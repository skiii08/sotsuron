The Ring," Oh...my...God
","I'm what a lot of people might consider a cold human being, but I genuinely screamed at this movie.  For those who have seen it, Samara's little teleportation shuffle did the trick.  When that evil-looking little girl stepped out, I jumped back into the row behind me.  Scariest.  Movie. Ever.",10,1,1,19 February 2003
