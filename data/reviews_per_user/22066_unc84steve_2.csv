Requiem for a Dream," Protest vote. Ironically like a drug.
","I don't really think this is a one-star movie, but there is no way this movie should be rated #34 in the all-time list.  Sorry.Drugs bad. Prescription drugs are drugs. TV is a drug. Pretty people and stylized techniques make a good movie.Cool. It's like a drug. Ironic.Actually it's kinda neat.  It's emptiness and all. But don't think it's an all-time great movie.  Really it deserves 4.9. Or 5.1.  No 4.9.  Like a cigarette, almost enough to satisfy.",1,13,27,13 February 2003
Mulholland Drive," Film-making is a trust relationship.
","(Spoilers)Around the time 'Betty' arrives at LAX as the fresh-faced ingenue hoping to make it big in 'dreamland' Hollywood, I found myself getting annoyed at the obvious movie manipulation.  I hadn't felt so angry since seeing 'ET'.I stayed on the ride long enough to see inconsistencies make sense in 'dream logic.'  Fair enough.  The 'dream' ended & pieces came together in a fresh way.  Those pieces didn't need to fit perfectly.Film needs rules to communicate with the viewer.  A director may play with the rules as part of the experience.  David Lynch does this a lot and thus angers many viewers.Formula movies are trite & insulting--they follow too many rules.  Films like 'Magnolia' & 'Go' that creatively transcend convention are refreshing. I respect John Ford's ability to tell stories with pure technique.
Different viewers vary in their trust of Lynch's ability to make a coherent movie and vary in their tolerance with his abuse of the rules.  Lynch's past films reduces one's trust. Knowing that 'Mulholland Drive' was a TV pilot converted into a film doesn't help.I understand how David Lynch generates anger & adoration--it's due how much a viewer trust him or feels betrayed.  For me, the film redeemed itself in the last half hour.  However, I won't fully invest myself in Lynch's future work. I don't think that repeated viewings will tighten all the mysteries. It might provide a rich emotional experience.If I get around to it :-)",Null,0,1,7 December 2002
