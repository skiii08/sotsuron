The Avengers," Not good, not bad
","This is basically a movie that's here for a purpose. As a viewer you'll certainly have some fun, even though the movie is too long for my taste. It should be 20 min. less in duration, especially at the beginning where all the unnecessary dialog is taking place. Other purpose is for a Hollywood to make a quick buck - you have all the well known characters from their previous movies, that are just here in one place all together. Screenplay is weak, as well as the basic idea and main villain. If you can kill 'those aliens' with guns and arrows, you don't really need super heroes now do you. And the final and maybe he most important purpose is to make more cash for the upcoming movies that will feature all of these characters individually. Well known Hollywood formula: milk the cash as long as you can.",6,3,8,22 August 2012
