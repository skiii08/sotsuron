Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Really quite good
","I thought this movie was a great prequel and addition to the star wars collection.  It may not of had quite the same swashbuckling action as the first three, but it held its own.",10,0,0,14 June 1999
The Fifth Element," An odd depiction of the future, but good
","Don't get me wrong, I loved this film, but it was rather strange at times. The scene on the airplane where Chris Rock pretty much rapes the stewardess is pretty odd, and didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie.  Still it had some excellent action scenes and was a non-stop action film.  Eight out of ten.",8,0,1,9 June 1999
Romeo + Juliet," An excellent modern version of Shakespeare
","At first I thought that this might be just another reason for William Shakespeare to roll over in his grave, but after seeing it I totally think the opposite.  This movie proves that a good modern version of an actual Shakespeare play can be made.",10,0,1,26 May 1999
American History X," incredibly sad, but an outstanding film
","This movie was probably one of the top ten films of my life.  It was also on the top ten most scary, moving, and sad movies of my life.  It sheds light on the generally little-known topic of Neo-Nazis and at the same time of our high-security prisons.  I would recommend this movie to anyone over 12 who would be mature enough to handle the content.",10,0,0,19 June 1999
Detroit Rock City," A bit funny, yet not very realistic
","The movie Detroit Rock City is pretty funny, but just doesn't cut it for me. The movie seems to drag on forever and the romances are bizarre and spontaneous.  Take one character for instance, he strips at a club (although he's underage)to make money to buy Kiss tickets, loses the contest for money, and yet somehow ends up making love to a beautiful 30+ woman who's eye he catches at the bar.  It's a decent,light-hearted comedy, but extremely ridiculous and not realistic at all, even for a teenage rock/love story.",6,0,2,10 January 2000
The Sixth Sense," An incredible film
","First off, Haley Joel Osment (plays Cole) is one heck of an actor.  His performance rivals that of Linda Blair in 'The Exorcist' and Henry Thomas in 'E.T.'.  Osment brilliantly plays true horror and fear and I found it hard to believe that he wasn't truly haunted by unknowing ghosts.  The film is a visual masterpiece.  The use of the color bright red is so perfect and downright spooky that I can't see that cinematographer not getting an award. The story itself is great, but the final touch is the complete horror of the idea that you could be dead and not know it.  Rent, buy it, or watch it and think about it.",10,0,0,21 January 2000
