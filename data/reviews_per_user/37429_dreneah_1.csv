Hereditary," SO STUPID
","I kept hearing people say how they saw this and then didn't sleep for days. Maybe I'm jaded from seeing too many horrors, but this was beyond boring and predictable. It didn't even have the decency to be funny like Zombeavers or Attack of the Killer Doughnuts. The only horror worse than this garbage was Babadook. And the ending couldn't possibly be dumber. Seriously. Wtf.",1,1,4,26 June 2018
