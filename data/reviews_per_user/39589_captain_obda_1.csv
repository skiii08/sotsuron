Saturday Night Fever," A classic
","Travolta gives an astonishing performance in a movie that for me is the epitome of a movie meditation on the themes of youth culture, society and human interaction. Saturday Night Fever is intelligent, realistic, multi layered and the subtleties of the various facets of the narrative are perfectly blended by an all perfect combination of performance, screenplay, direction and soundtrack. This movie speaks for a generation - not just for its style - but it explores universal and timeless themes in a powerful way through understatement, and questions this society through the dramatic device of characterization and relationships. The result is ultimately convincing and has genuine emotional impact. I've never seen any other film which seems as fresh and challenging after the tenth viewing as it did after the first.It saddens me that so many of the wholly excellent cast members were unable to launch a consistent, internationally successful acting career following their triumph here in SNF. However, their outstanding legacy from this movie will live on for many generations to come. Thank you to everyone involved in Saturday Night Fever - every member of the cast, screen writer Norman Wexler, director John Badham, for the faith of Robert Stigwood in this project, the monumental soundtrack and finally to every single member of the crew for their contribution to making a powerful statement not only about a time and a place, but about the human condition itself.",10,0,1,27 March 2003
