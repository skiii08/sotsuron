","what can i say??? the blair witch project came to my cinemas on october 27th 1999.i didnt know what to expect from such a low budget'd film, but i thought it was marvelous and i cant wait intill the blair witch 2 comes out later this year, i am really looking forward to going to watch that again. i have just bought the blair witch project on D.V.D and i am very glad to say 'it is just as good as it was, when i watched it at the cinemas!!!'",Null,0,1,21 April 2000
