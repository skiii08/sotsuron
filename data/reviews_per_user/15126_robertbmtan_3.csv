Skyfall," Finally breaking the 'Bond formula'
","For twenty-something films, Bond movies have always followed the same 'Bond formula' (although who can blame them, it's mostly enticing and satisfying to watch: see Casino Royale). But not anymore. This is the first Bond film that captures everything a Bond film should have - the amazing score, spy action, feats of impossibility, classy and luxurious settings, a criminal mastermind, near apocalyptic scenarios...etc. yet doesn't feel at all cliché. For the first time, the tables have been turned against Bond from the very beginning: he is getting older, his abilities have deteriorated, and he is no longer equipped with futuristic gadgets we're all so used to. From there, the plot develops as a typical Bond film... or so it seems... until things really start escalating. Without spoiling much, I'll just say that the plot takes many turns that immediately sucks viewers in. Unlike many other mediocre bond films, the plot in this leaves viewers engaged and invested in the story. Moving beyond the plot, the characters in this film are also portrayed perfectly. Although some may think it's a bit cliché - a classy womanizing spy, a badass criminal mastermind, a beautiful and seductive damsel, this is a Bond film after all. And these characters are all so very classy, leaving viewers incredibly satisfied upon viewing. But what makes this film a true masterpiece is the cinematography. From the first scene to the end, the tone and environmental shifts create a surreal and artistic experience. Many shots are incredibly artistic, with amazing background contrasts, focus usage, closeups that capture the grandeur of a exemplary Bond film. Finally, the colors and tones of this film paint a truly unique experience, where the many shifts between cold and warm colors accompany the rise and fall in plot points, generating suspense and emotion to the film.It doesn't matter if you usually watch Bond films or not, I'd recommend this film to anyone who remotely likes action and suspense. The cinematography and plot are both atypical of Bond films yet excel spectacularly in the spy film genre.",9,5,7,7 September 2017
Hero," A Wuxia masterpiece with extraordinary screenplay and action scenes
","If I had to describe this film in one word, it would be 'surreal'. In all honesty, I wouldn't even classify this as a historical fiction film, it fits more as a fantasy film, but I'll explain that later.From the very beginning to the very end, this film has little dialogue between characters, yet the film still has an extremely interesting and complicated plot. The suspense and mystery elements of the plot are expertly crafted with just the right mix of probable yet unsuspecting. Without spoiling too much of the film, I will just say that the plot keeps viewers engaged from beginning to end. The moral ambiguities of the characters allow viewers to generate their own interpretations and understandings of the plot as it goes, which is atypical of most Wuxia films. The plot of this film isn't one of those 'good guy beats up bad guys' films or 'saving the damsel in distress'. The protagonist and the antagonist (so to speak) are both just fighting for their country, but the theme reveals something much larger. Although some people may argue that the plot was being overly dramatic, unrealistic, and too cheesy, I would say that the plot plays perfectly to the fantasy-like historical setting and surreal action.Moving on to the characters - as I said, this film contains very little dialogue, while perfectly building each character's classiness, mysteriousness, and frankly just their coolness. Again, some may argue that these characters are way too unrealistic and cliché, but as a Wuxia film, these characters, again, fit perfectly. Where each character has their flaws, we all get a sense that these people are above human in almost every way, and that's what the director wants us to feel. These Wuxia have been training for their entire lives, and ARE above us in a godly way, making the film that much more satisfying.Of course, this film isn't known for its characters and plot, but rather the action and environment. While many Chinese films feature cheesy acting and low budget settings, this film creates a truly epic feeling rivaling that of Saving Private Ryan. The action is truly satisfying with actors the likes of Jet Li and Donnie Yen playing badass roles. And this film takes it to the next level with high budget action scenes that feel surreal from beginning to end - it's everything I've ever wanted in Wuxia action scenes. And finally, the setting of this film is absolutely stunning. Almost every single scene is worthy of being screenshotted and set as a wallpaper. The film captures the complete beauty of nature (presumably during the Warring Kingdoms in China) with the colors of every scene reflecting the tone of the film. I really can't say much more other than this film is an artistic masterpiece - see for yourself. The blend of colors by using the tone of the scene, the props, the clothing, and the scenery itself in every single setting always creates a harmonic and surreal experience for the viewers. If anything, I would highly encourage you to watch it just based on the cinematography. I haven't seen anything like it, not even in the Grand Budapest Hotel or the Secret Life of Walter Mitty - perhaps due to the oriental and historic setting, but nevertheless it's a truly extraordinary experience.I rate this film a 10/10 not because I think it's flawless (it has a few continuity issues and the pacing isn't exactly amazing), but because it's a Wuxia masterpiece unlike anything else I've seen. I'm a sucker for cinematography and action so that itself deserves a 10/10, but with an amazing plot as well, it's one of the top films I've ever recommended.",10,1,1,6 September 2017
Minions," I'd rather watch the emoji movie 10 times
","What is this. When the top review right now on IMDb is a troll review giving it a 10/10 you know something is wrong. I get that this film is trying to appeal to kids below the age of 3 with the lack of dialogue and utter absurdity, but at least make it enjoyable to the general public as well. If you want to get an idea of much you might enjoy this film (out of 10), you can simply take the inverse of your age and multiply it by 10. For example, a 1 year old would rate this film a 10/10 and a 25 year old will enjoy this film 0.4/10.OK now onto the real review. I'll first preface this by saying I really liked the first Despicable Me, and I watch many animated comedies - I'm not some sad old man with no sense of humor. But the attempted comedy in this film is so dry and stupid that it's honestly hard to laugh. Perhaps you can laugh out of pity. At least the emoji movie is a film had expectations so low and responses so bad that we could laugh about it. All this film does is have minions laugh and 'speak' (more like make random sounds) in an annoying voice. Honestly there's no way you wouldn't hate minions after watching this film. The jokes in this film are unoriginal and poorly integrated.Plot: There is no plot.Characters: Lol. (can you really call minions 'characters' when they have no personality and all look the same?) Setting: OK I'll be honesty, the animation and setting is pretty well made, but there's no reason to watch it for that. It's literally just a high budget DreamWorks animation :/ My advice is don't even take your 1 year old kid to watch it cuz even they will cry at how horrible this film is.",1,1,1,7 September 2017
