Vertigo," A masterpiece of cinema
","Vertigo should be in the top ten on IMDb for Hitchcock's groundbreaking cinematography that definitely paved the way for modern cinema. It is Hitchcock at his finest hour and the score, shots and overall mood that the movie creates is absolutely astonishing. Vertigo and other Hitchcock films seem to able to create a certain hold on an audience member even before the audience knows what is going. A extraordinary feat in cinema that any movie lover should watch.",10,2,3,31 May 2017
