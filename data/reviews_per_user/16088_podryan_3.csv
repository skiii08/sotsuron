Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I can't believe it's not butter...
","I will admit, this film has a great first impression. For anyone who loves fireworks or laser lights, this is definitely the film for you. For anyone who likes books or classical music, maybe something a little more drab and tasteful is more for you. Unfortunately, I'm more of book person, myself.While I love a decent and mindless action flick, that wasn't ALL I was expecting from Tarantino in these movies. I admired the lofty dialogue that Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction bared, but that suddenly disappeared. In fact, it was replaced with overpoweringly cheesy dialogue! What happened? I will admit, however, a very admirable conversation between Bill and B about Superman had me thinking, 'Wow, cool stuff.' As far as I can see, this film does a great job of capturing the majority of mindless audiences out there, which is probably why more people actually care about his previous films. Because, good lord, it's cool to like QT now! And while capturing such an audience and gaining that can of recognition CAN be considered an achievement, somewhat, a movie with all style and NO substance is a B movie, period.No amount of guide-wire flipping or blood-spray can change the fact that this movie is a pretty cheap attempt to gain an audience. Oh, but of course, it's all about revenge. The one of many quotes in the tagline says so. Poor B must Kill Bill (*shivers*) because he killed her friends, took her baby, and then tried to kill her. So.... in turn...now she must..... Kill Bill..Case and point, why do I really care? Yeah, it's that simple. The title itself could be the only dialogue in the entire movie and it wouldn't change a thing. Read the title, no need to read the back.The Kill Bill series is a bottle rocket, nothing more. Do yourself a favor and save up for the fourth of July.",5,23,43,25 September 2006

","There is something about Zuit suits and Thompson machine guns that naturally attracts me to these types of films. However, knowing full well about the subject of the film, and the fact that it's widely praised pretty much everywhere, I needed no gimmicks to get my attention. This based-on-a-true-story film about a group of law-enforcement agents, led by Eliot Ness, is made up of four men who join up to stop the flow of crime and illegal booze from Al Capone.While the actual group had nine men, this premature depiction of the team is made up of some of the best acting I've seen. While I'm not the biggest Costner fan, I think this was one of his best performances. He basically nailed the by-the-book, good-hearted hero role on the head, flawlessly. Still, the one thing that makes this film one of my all-time favorites is the spectacular performance by Sean Connery as the racist, old-school street cop, Jim Malone. His rugged sense of humor and course actions give the film a certain charm that couldn't have come from any of the other characters. Oh, I can't forget De Niro, though. If there was one person who was meant to play a gangster or mob boss, it was De Niro.The main thing that surprises me about this film, is the fact that it fallows that clich√© 'path of the hero,' with Costner as the timid hero, receiving his call to action and Connery as the disgruntled mentor, pushing and guiding the hero along. What's surprising, though, is that this film still finds a way to make itself seem intriguing in a whole new way, as if to not even copy that formula. I don't know how they did it, but I love this films and I can honestly say it was worth every penny.",10,2,3,20 August 2006

","I had some high hopes for this movie. To be blunt, my hopes crashed into the dirt and splattered into evenly sized chunks. This movie is very misleading. By misleading, I mean the trailers show off just about every good shot or sequence within the entire film. The hype and fanbase for this film reminds me a lot of that of Snakes On A Plane's. A one-liner is pretty much what the fans were looking forward to ('This is SPARTA!!!') and, lo and behold, it was received with applause in the Imax theater I payed $15 admission to.That said, the acting in the film is pretty horrid. Not even the one-liners were done with grace; there's really just a bunch of screaming, nothing more, nothing less. That's what I'm having trouble with: both the writing and acting were bad (a deadly combination), which makes it difficult to reason with either one. Shabby writing can offset good acting, and vice versa.The effects were good and bad throughout the film. The visual look was a little too monochromatic and became boring after a while. The blood splatter didn't quite fit the look of the film, either; it was nothing more than groups of tiny, little drops that flew into the air and even vanished when it hit the ground. The costume design was pretty and there were a few shots that worked wonders for the imagination, but certain things didn't quite fit. Such as the fat thing with cleavers for hands, I have no idea where that came from. Though, that's a fault of the graphic novel itself, taking history/legend and turning it into a laser light show for the ADD public. That's why I'm lenient towards the dull plot in this film, having been taken from a medium that's visually aesthetic above anything else.I mentioned there were a few shots in the film that were great. That's true. But, I failed to mention that there are only a few of them. The film tries desperately to be dramatic in certain parts, mainly battle scenes, but the end result is more over-exaggerated. After about the 30th slow-mo shot, I started to become a little aggravated. Practically every swing, every jump, every release of a bow string is done in slow motion. I consider that more of a crutch, rather than a creative quality. There are also some shots that could have been done on location. Why they had to film 99.9% of the film on a green screen is beyond me.I'm still not quite sure what to call this film. It's epic, yes, but anyone can throw a bunch of colors onto a canvas and call it 'epic.' In the end, whatever you've produced is pointless if it's without any real meaning, thought, or reason.This film is meant to be visual, pure and simple, and it doesn't even achieve THAT very admirably. All I can say, and this will sound mean, is that people who enjoy watching booth- bought fireworks during July 4th will definitely love this movie. Anyone else would best spend their milk money on another film.And yes, the title should have been 50 instead of 300. Why? Because that's basically the number of Spartans you see fighting throughout the film.",4,18,39,10 March 2007
