Come and See," unique war film
","'Come and See' is unique in style, particularly the use of sound, as in the first half of the film when the boy is shell-shocked and deafened and hears a surreal mixture of the natural world and his own thoughts and memories. It was haunting to say the least, especially as it is counterpointed by an idyllic interlude with the girl in the forest before the Nazis arrive in earnest.  What is not unique about the film is its 'How bad were the Nazis?' portrayal of the casual evil of atrocity and murder.  It is shocking even as it is trite, the horrendous violence that was perpetrated with an almost incomprehensible and unanimous joy.  The whole world seems unable to get enough of the recreation of this time of plague of human evil, even after 60 years, and some things should never be forgotten, the sacrifice and nobility of the martyrs and resisters especially.  'Come and See' has plenty of that spirit, of the outnumbered rag-tag Russian fighters, and its nationalist pride is understandable.  But it is the nihilistic, crushing aspect of war, no matter who the combatants, that make this and all films about war so meaningful, regardless of the historical setting.",9,5,9,25 February 2003
Minority Report," spielberg keeps growing
","Hot on the heels of his most audacious and adult work, 'A.I.,' comes this dark and challenging science fiction film from Spielberg based on a short story by the dark & challenging Philip K. Dick.  It reminded me a lot of 'The End of Violence,' the Wim Wenders film with the same theme, a future where crime is eliminated at the cost of privacy and freedom, raising some fundamental and provocative questions.  Special effects are of course dazzling, and Tom Cruise lends his character the ambiguities of a damaged drug-addicted hero, I think P.K. Dick would have approved of the tone and the vision.  Spielberg has indeed grown up at last, facing life's ambiguities and moral dilemmas that are not solved by a swelling John Williams finale...",Null,0,0,31 October 2002
Meet the Parents," pretty sad
","This kind of lame-brained comedy that is so cherished by the mass market must fill some kind of masochistic social need, but I personally don't get it.  I loved and admired such dark comedies as 'After Hours,' 'The Out of Towners' and even 'Something About Mary,' but they had something that this one lacked: intelligence and a sense of the unexpected.  This script seemed to be written around Stiller & DeNiro, a series of gags and sketches that add up to a big rollicking nothing.  This is very much in the 'Home Alone' vein, written for adolescents who revel in unsubtle physical humor, much of it based in cruelty (S&M all the way) with a sickly sweet ending that was a foregone conclusion from the beginning.",3,1,2,18 November 2002
Capote," excruciating
","If Richard Brooks' film of 'In Cold Blood' wasn't stark and painfully slow enough for you, this movie goes it one worse. Not only do we get the suffering and torment of the murder victims and the perpetrators, but we also get the suffering and torment of the insufferable personality who brought the story to 'life,' Truman Capote. All the minor and incidental characters seem to be in some sort of existential pain as well.From his vapid anecdotes over cocktails at NY literary parties (the real Capote must have been a little more witty and charismatic than this!) to his manipulation of the supposed friendship he forged with the murderers, complete with lies and crocodile tears, this Capote is not only distasteful and pathetic but his true talent is never believably conveyed. Hoffman's portrayal is sure to garner many accolades, and this dark slow film many award nominations, but to me the whole mess was just hollow and cold, completely unengaging. And the dialogue was poorly written, the cardinal failing of any film...",5,7,13,21 October 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," grandpa's life
","The feeling I had after watching 'Little Miss Sunshine' was very mixed, although I liked the film very much. Why did Grandpa want the innocent Olive to shock the audience with a routine that would all but assure her losing? The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that the grandfather's back story was really the key to the movie. The advice he gives his grandson (you know, about a LOT of DIFFERENT women) and the pride he conveys to his loser son for at least TRYING to make it on his own, point to one fact: Grandpa was not the free spirit he appeared to be, but a sad individual who had probably been faithfully married to the same woman for 50 years, and had worked slavishly for the same company for decades, too. This is why he devised the outrageous routine for Olive, to thumb his own frustrated nose at society and the phonies he knew would be attending such a lame pageant. There was no triumph for the family except for their individual realizations of how much they needed, and loved, each other. And there was still hope for all of them that they would not lead as quietly desperate lives as poor old Grandpa.PS: the fact that the producers thought Alan Arkin too virile for the role only bears out their concept of the character being a pathetic, frustrated individual.",8,3,8,17 January 2007
American Beauty," deep doo doo
","Like, spoiler, dude, like you havent seen it...The deepest metaphysical question this movie seemed to be asking is whether God is an empty garbage bag or an empty shopping bag floating in a silent suburban updraft.  Come to think of it, that's a pretty good question, in a vapid split-level quest for meaning, but not enough to raise it above all those other postmodern predeath quasi-comedies.  It was certainly palatable to the masses, who reacted to its wildly contrived ending and the truth of the disembodied narration in much the same way as that other metaphysical mass market marvel, The Sixth Sense.  Well, if the kids and the Academy loved it, who am I to put it down?",4,1,2,8 August 2002
Mulholland Drive," what it's about
","SPOILER: That is, if there can be a spoiler for a film that has so many interpretations.  However, if everyone can agree that the central character (indeed, the ONLY character) has committed suicide, the film can only be interpreted as this soul's struggle in the bardo/afterlife to escape from that particular life, to let go of it after examining it and the karma it has accumulated.  Regardless of one's view of the 'afterlife' one must assume that the soul must go through some kind of hell to shed the personality and the human life's 'sins' to be able to let go and enter 'heaven'.  This is thought of in many religious traditions as a dream, the Big Sleep as it were, from which there is no awakening beyond liberation or rebirth.  I believe that David Lynch has read, even studied, the Book of the Dead, and in this intensely spiritual film, has left the realm of human sleeping dreams of his other films, and entered the realm of the between-life state, in a most brilliant way that cannot be apprehended intellectually but, because it has been shown to be such a popular movie, is communicated directly and understood through the unconscious, the collective unconscious that knows the truth of this teaching.There are some elements of the film that can only be understood through Mr. Lynch's unconscious, which is appropriate in that it is a personal meditation on death, first and foremost.  Some elements are cinematic, some are probably riffs that Lynch and his collaborators came up with, coyote-like, cosmic jokes with no punch-lines, or a million punch-lines. The bardo is inhabited by demons and guides, sometimes cloaked in the same guise, like the old couple, who in life were probably someone the lost soul had flown into LA with, memories of the past life no longer filtered through the conscious memory of the living, but seen as just a dream, one that must be worked out for the soul to go onward.The physical location of Mulholland Drive is very much a bardo for probably many souls, including this poor woman who came to Hollywood with hopes and ideals, fell into a lesbian affair with a woman whose career is taking off as hers is failing, and kills herself.  How she deals with it afterwards is what Lynch's supremely important work is all about.",10,3,4,4 April 2003
Black Snake Moan," a little allegory
","This movie had a notion to be something gritty and provocative, but with all its dirty talk and soft-core sex, ends up being some kind of white-trash fairy tale where the fairy godmother is a black semi-legendary bluesman who's having his own crisis of faith. If you don't automatically flash to Robert Johnson down at the crossroads, there are some clips of Son House talking about the real meaning of the blues. Stereotypes abound in 'Black Snake Moan' which isn't a bad thing when you're trying to create an allegory for race relations down in the delta and how much nobler rural southern blacks are than their ignorant immoral white counterparts. Having grown up (white) in the south in the 50s and 60s, I know there's quite a bit of truth in that.Christina Ricci is pretty good in this symbolic role, plenty ignorant and even more immoral, a nymphomaniac who of course was a victim of incestuous abuse as a child. Sam Jackson is engaging as a soul-searching honest truck farmer who hung up his Gibson a few years before to marry and have a family, which didn't work out the way he'd hoped. The extreme sex, drugs, and violence in the girl's life foreshadow a dark tale, but the story quickly devolves into a 'black' comedy with a tidy Hollywood ending.A little more realism would have helped. For instance, when 'Rae' takes four vicious punches to the face, she should have looked a whole lot more swollen instead of her petite features smeared with some fake dried blood, and 2 days later it's barely noticeable. If she had done an elephant-man number for the middle of the movie, imagine, she probably would be front-runner for an Oscar next year. (Think Charlize.) She still may be, if only for the way she acts circles around Justin Timberlake, who is not quite bad, and keeps up pretty admirably with Sam Jackson.",6,11,17,22 February 2007
Singin' in the Rain," the greatest
","I first saw 'Singin' in the Rain' at the drive-in at age 4. It didn't do much for me. I saw it again in the 60s and still didn't get it. It wasn't until the 80s that I got it--in a big way. As a musical fan, even as a teenager ('Bye Bye Birdie' 'Damn Yankees' and 'The Music Man' were my favorites), I've watched 'Singin' in the Rain' many times since, turning many people onto it as well. It is a thrill, a laugh, a beautiful dream even of Hollywood, and the damned raindance is the weakest scene for me, made even moreso by its being excerpted about a thousand times. (Of course that's the one I liked when I was 4.) Like 'Wizard of Oz', in a class by itself and should be seen by everyone, even or especially those that hate musicals...",10,1,4,19 January 2005
The Witch," Wiccans vs Christians
","So what this film is basically saying is that the Salem witch trials were in fact legitimate. The women accused actually did perform supernatural acts that were, if not evil, then at least hateful. I see the popularity of this film as a case of atheists/pagans/wiccans reveling in their assumed power and 'demonizing' the sanctimony of the Christian establishment.The witches' power when it is finally revealed is awful and in fact seems to justify the longstanding superstitions about witches and satanic practices. I know there are 'good witches' and 'bad witches' (I saw 'Wizard of Oz') but there is only evil in this film. If it has a meaning or a message, it is that the old superstitions are true.",4,1,4,27 December 2016
Signs," lame & derivative
","On the basis of Shyamalan's 3 major films, I think one can start drawing conclusions about his work.  First of all, he has 'tackled' the 3 greatest mysteries of life: Death, UFOs, and Comic Books.  His treatment of all 3 is simplistic to say the least.  It would be an insult to the New Age movement to call them that, they seem just lukewarm meditations based on late-night student philosophy ramblings or just too many comic books.  So 'Signs' was not so much a disappointment for me as a confirmation (and a waste of time.)His trademarks, at this point in his young career, are jarring implausibilities in the stories and unnatural, painfully stilted dialogue. The acting is almost uniformly wooden.  To underscore this, he even had the nerve to 'perform' in one of the major roles of 'Signs' and reveal his shortcomings in front of the camera as well.  (These are not flaws for audiences of limited intelligence, so I predict his continued success with the mass market.) In fact, the only thing he seems to have going as a director is a good visual sense.  So I would not be interested in seeing any future films by this director unless he should happen to hire a writer or two to help him reveal the Great Mysteries with a little more intelligence.",Null,1,1,26 February 2003
The Sixth Sense," bardo training for the masses
","*spoiler warning* Without the performance of Osment, this blockbuster would've been lackluster...It's amazing to me that moviegoers loved the ending but considered the ending of 'Jacob's Ladder' a cop-out.  Bruce Joel Rubin, a Buddhist, wrote the screenplay to 'Jacob's Ladder' to portray the after-death bardo state, but was unable to get it produced, so he wrote a mass-market romantic-comedy version, which won him an Oscar for 'Ghost.' Perhaps a simplistic version is better than none ('What Dreams May Come'). For great bardo films, see 'Mulholland Drive,' 'Waking Life' or 'Dead Man.' 4/10",2,1,3,27 May 2002
