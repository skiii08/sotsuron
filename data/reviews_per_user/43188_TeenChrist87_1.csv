The New World," Terrible Movie
","I was very anxious to see The New World since I am a fan of Disney's Pocahontas. I wanted to see if this was anything like it. In a few ways it was, but not too many. My rating on this movie doesn't have anything to do with Disney's Pocahontas. My rating is on this movie itself. It was a complete bore. After 1 hour and 15 minutes I just couldn't take it anymore. It really was THAT bad. I can't believe people actually like this movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless you want to punish your teenagers. Just put this movie in and it could be worse than grounding them and taking away their allowance. It really is THIS bad.",1,4,11,26 May 2006
