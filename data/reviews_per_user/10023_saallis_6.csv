Unbreakable," Good vs Evil
","He did it again...Amazing; two perfect movies in a row. Both have many simularities; color-use, depressive setting. He made the good old plot; good vs evil to an emotional, and wonderfull picture.Thanx Night!",10,0,0,26 December 2000
Snatch," Brilliant
","A brilliant sequal to the brilliant Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.Snatch has the extra comedy ingrediense to make this even a better movie than Lock Stock. (Wow!! A sequal better than the original!!).The best with the movie was the triangle-scene in the middle, starting with the milk out the window.",10,0,1,4 December 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Best, but disapointing
","A perfect film, if there is such a thing...To bad the movie is parting so much with the book, but that has nothing to do with the movie itself..Can't wait for Kings...",10,0,0,25 December 2002
Pulp Fiction," Beyond Perfect
","Every scene in this film is absolutely brilliant. Every dialog is so interesting that you can't turn it off. My friend, Per Christian, and myself tried to find a perfect scene, but ended up with the feeling that every single scene is perfect beyond any recognition. The greatest movie ever...by far.Two thumbs up Tarantino!!",10,0,1,18 August 2000
