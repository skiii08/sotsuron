Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Brilliant!
","I have enjoyed all three pirates of the Caribbean movies and On Stranger Tides was a brilliant new story in the saga.My only complaint was that Jack the monkey only had a small amount of screen time.Blackbeard was an amazing villain, played brilliantly by Ian McShane. Geoffrey rush and Johnny Depp were brilliant as usual and I really liked the character that Penelope Cruz brought to life. She was feisty and a great sword fighter just like jack sparrow! If you're a fan of the previous movies than you should definitely watch this one! I can't wait for part 5!!!",9,1,2,21 May 2011
