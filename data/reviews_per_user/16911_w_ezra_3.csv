The Ring," Finally...a great comedy
","This light-hearted comedy had me laughing the whole time.  The plot was marvelous and hit me right to the heart.  I am so glad that they finally made a spoof on horror movies.  My favorite scene was when they PURPOSEFULLY showed the mic they were recording the voices with...2 TIMES.  I loved how they started the movie like scream and how they even had a scene just like signs.  I have a question though...if a kid can make pictures with their mind why do they come out w/ black marker on overhead sheets?  And if you like this movie I hope that you get 'No Mercy, No Remorse' by RBX MWHAHA HAHAHA.  X FILES.",Null,0,0,22 October 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," what i expected and more...
","I saw the matrix reloaded last night and I loved it. I woke up this morning and thought more about it and loved it more. Sure it does have it's flaws(zion, not the best acting,etc)but overall it was a great flick. And if you are complaining about the 'to be concluded' then you are an idiot. I along with every smart person alive guessed that the movie would end with a huge cliffhanger. And so it did. And that is the reason i am waiting for revolutions to be released. The graphics, especially when Neo flies....WOAH. It blew me away. Some of the fight scenes mightve lasted a little too long but they were still amazing. The highway scene was a let down for me but it was still a good scene. Overall, I'd give the movie an 8.5 out of 10 and i'd recommend that you go see this if you havent seen it. If you have seen the first matrix, be warned that the plot is going to change and your eyes will be even more opened to what is real and what isn't.",9,0,0,15 May 2003
