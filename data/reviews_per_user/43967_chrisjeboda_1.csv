Scarface," The Quintessential Embodiment of the American Dream
","This classical masterpiece provides the greatest representation of the greatest idea mankind has ever conceived. It is a daring tale (loosely based on Pablo Escobar) that has captivated the minds of all viewers while transcending film by transforming music, culture and philosophy. It is far more than a 'gangster flick' this is Scarface!",10,1,2,2 September 2019
