The Blair Witch Project," Amateurish Home Video
","Grossly overhyped, The Blair Witch Project is an astoundingly lethal bore that spends much of its eighty minutes giving viewers motion sickness from its 'cinematography.' Most of the movie is video that's been transferred to film with occasional clips from a 16 mm B&W camera.  Nothing is more painful than watching violently moving, blurred, extreme close ups of the ground. As for the story, three Gen-X 'filmmakers' set out to document a local legend, get lost in the woods, scream obscenities at each other, and then die.  I have two suggestions for Myrick and Sanchez's next project: a tripod and a subscription to Videomaker Magazine.",1,1,3,27 July 1999
The Mummy," Raiders of the Lost City of the Dead
","I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.  Production values are first rate, and the computer generated images are extremely well done.  The characters are fun to watch and Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep made a great villain. However, the scriptwriting was lazy at best, and incompetent at worst.  If Imhotep was really that powerful and evil, why make it so easy for him to come back?  It's like catching a serial killer, putting him in jail, and then leaving the keys to his cell within arm's reach.  Some 'mumbo jumbo' during the set up was needed to explain why they simply couldn't kill Imhotep and turn him into sausage.  Go see the movie, just leave your brain at home.",1,2,7,14 May 1999
