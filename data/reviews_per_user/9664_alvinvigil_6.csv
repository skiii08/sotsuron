United 93," UNITED 93, a classic!
","Much controversy has been with United 93 since it's inception sometime last year. The 'too soon' mentality of those who see that films exploiting or depicting those horrible events of September 11, 2001 is here. The second film about 9/11, Oliver Stone's World Trade Center, will be in theaters later on this year. There's no need to go over the plot points of the film. The world already knows it. From the opening scene of the four hijackers reading from the Koran to the descending plane which ultimately crashes, United 93, is a mesmerizing, unforgettable, and heart-wrenching masterpiece. This docudrama was directed by Paul Greengrass, a director who got to know the families of the victims that perished from the plane. He tells us the story with sensitivity, and does the enormous feat of honoring those who fought back realizing that the plane was not going to be 'turned around' but was being used as a missile for an American landmark (one of the terrorists taped a picture of the Capitol in the cockpit). There are no back stories to be told. Everything is told from the morning of September 11th forward. There is no mention of Osama, Iraq or even terrorism. We do know of a few key characters but we know nothing of them. They are all portrayed in the moment, going about their business, waiting at the airport terminal, getting on the plane, making friendly conversations, flight attendants making sure everyone is buckled, pilots having their morning orange juice. Scenes on-board the plane are inter cut with traffic control centers and military command rooms. Amazingly, some of the people actually play themselves. The third act of the film harbors over some of the passengers realizing what's happening as they figure out that the pilots, a flight attendant and a 1st class passenger have been brutally killed. Pieced together from taped recordings from passengers calling their loved ones and one flight attendant getting a hold of a United mechanic, the devastating scenes of the passengers attacking the hijackers are some of the most intense of any film I've ever seen. Some of the passengers, as they call their loved ones will pull at your heart strings. As one woman tearfully ends a conversation with a loved one, she hands her cell phone over to a young woman and says, 'Here, call your people'. It is all quite emotional. I must admit, I was an emotional wreck after viewing United 93. Greengrass has created a powerful, gut-wrenching, and courageous movie experience. Like that of The Passion of the Christ and Schindler's List, everyone must see this film at least once. It is a draining experience and extremely difficult to watch. But it's as important as any movie theater experience you'll ever have.",10,5,12,1 May 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A Visual Feast... Mesmerizing
","Having not read any of C.S. Lewis's fantasy novels, I was wondering what sort of magical world I would be entering upon viewing The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. Like the world of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, Narnia is a fantastical place, where animals speak, centaurs and satyrs roam the lands but is divided by good and evil. Four London children escape the wrath of World War II and go to live in the countryside estate of an eccentric professor (Jim Broadbent). There, while playing hide and seek, they find a wardrobe chest that leads to the snowy land of Narnia. The evil ice queen (Tilda Swinton) has a hold on the land of Narnia and turns anything and anyone into stone that tries to up rise against her. The land is a never ending white Winter. The children join forces with the creatures of Narnia, led by the leader of the pack, the lion Aslan, to defeat the evil White Witch and her quest for ruling the land.The Chronicles of Narnia is a visually impressive feat of Winter Wonderlands, Ice Castles, talking animals, mystical creatures, and a battle between good and evil but one of the most magical effects is that of Lucy, the youngest of the four children, who first enters the land of Narnia. Emotion as such cannot be created by any CGI. Disney's reported $150 million gamble hits the right notes for a successful franchise from the 55-year old book. To some, the story could be an allegory of the story of Christ but I didn't find that the film was arching for too many Christian themes. There are some bloodless, but violent scenes but as most children stories go, good always overthrows evil. Not only will children be thrilled by The Chronicles... adults, too, will be mesmerized.",8,1,3,7 December 2005
Nacho Libre," A few laughs don't make a comedy
","Time is so precious. Undeniably precious. Too bad I will never have that one hour and forty minutes that it took to sit through this dreck, back. Given the fact that Nacho Libre was directed by Jared Hess, who directed one of my favorite films of 2004, Napoleon Dynamite, I was looking forward to some great comedy. But instead, I got a pile of poo-poo. Jack Black plays Nacho, an orphan raised as a man who becomes the cook of a Mexican monastery in Oaxaca, Mexico. The monastery is on the brink of financial ruin, but Nacho finds it in his heart to become the greatest 'Luchardore' there ever was, also known as a Mexican wrestler, to earn money for the monastery and to feed the children. Enter the lovely and beautiful Sister Encarnacion (Ana de le Reguera), who he tries to impress and takes a special liking to her. There's no doubt about it... Jack Black is very funny. His Mexican accent is pretty much played for laughs. And we do laugh when he speaks. Hector Jimenez plays, Esqueleto, Nacho's skinny little sidekick. His facial expressions are perfect for comedy. But there's no story here. No explanation about the sport. Nacho Libre is a complete mess and seemed to be edited five minutes before the screening I attended. I do give kudos to Black for being a sport about wearing tights and having his enormous belly hang out for most of the movie. He just seems so out of place here. The four kids who were sitting right behind me were having a field day with the slapstick humor and fart scenes. And to a point, so was I. But I'm still longing for that precious hour and forty minutes that are gone forever.",2,20,50,13 June 2006
Twilight," Stands on it's own as a love story between a girl and a vampire
","About a year ago I was already reading and hearing about a new film, something called Twilight, which was going to hit in the fall of 2008. Well, the buzz is bigger than ever and the film finally opens this Friday. Gathering from earlier preview screenings, this film is going to be big. Based on the very popular books by Stephanie Meyer (there are 17 million books in print), Twilight is a unique vampire movie about a girl, Bella (Kristen Stewart) who moves in with her estranged father (Billy Burke) in Forks, Washington. Having always been different, she meets an even more mysterious guy, Edward (Robert Pattinson), who at first is disgusted by her (she's human, he is not) but then takes a liking to her. He's unlike any boy she's ever met and finds that Romeo and Juliet connection. Edward's family is unique; they're all vampires but don't feed on human blood, as a matter of fact, they don't eat at all. They live comfortably in a 'green house' somewhere in the forest. His dad (Peter Facinelli, Jenny Garth's husband) is a doctor at the local hospital and they have gobs of cash (the books reveal how well off they are, but in the film, there's no explanation). A clan of new vampires are passing through and they threaten the little Pacific Northwest town feeding on the small population, but one in the group James (Cam Gigandet), is out to get the young Bella. This modern day love story is the strangest vampire movie I've ever seen. It's sort of a cross between The Lost Boys and Gossip Girl, which if you think about it, is a pretty enticing combination. I have to admit, having not read any of the books in this four-part series, I didn't know what I was in for. I knew it was about vampire teens in some Washington coastal town and that's about it, but I was intrigued from the start. The young cast look like your every day teen, and the vampire cast are as pale as Casper the Ghost. Some move swiftly, some sprint up trees and some can see into the future, fast-drawing her visuals on paper. It's all quite impressive. The story primarily belongs to Bella and Edward. The teen vampire hasn't aged in 90 years and finally finds someone who isn't afraid of him. Unfortunately for him, she's mortal. She's definitely not afraid of his blood-thirsty needs and he fights off the temptation of human blood. I'd say he's sort of like an addict that keeps fighting his urges. See... I told you, it's unlike any other vampire movie I've seen. Twilight is certainly no Interview With A Vampire (my favorite vampire movie) or Bram Stoker's Dracula (my other favorite) but it certainly stands on it's own as a love story between a girl and a vampire; it's passionate, exciting, intense and the Northwest locations are beautiful, you just want to drive there for a weekend get-away.",7,63,128,19 November 2008
Cars," CARS is an Incredible Addition to Pixar's Library
","A hotshot stud of a car, Lightening McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), is off to the Piston Cup Championship in Los Angeles. He literally dreams about fame, fortune and sponsorship. Unexpectedly, he's detoured to the sleepy town of Radiator Springs, somewhere off of the legendary Route 66. There, he discovers that life isn't all about trophies and living life in the fast lane. Some off-beat characters in the new Disney/Pixar computer animated film are Sally, a pristine 2002 baby blue Porsche (Bonnie Hunt), Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet (Paul Newman), Ramone, a 1959 Chevy Impala with as an East LA talking' low-rider (Cheech Marin) and Mater as in 'Tom Mater' (get it?), a rusty hillbilly tow-truck (Larry the Cable Guy). The all-star cast also includes the voices of racing legends, Richard Petty and Mario Andretti, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. A casting coupe would've been adding Chong (hey, Cheech is already a voice in the movie) as Filmore, the peace-loving hippie Volkswagen bus. But George Carlin fills in those shoes. Cars is a fantastic addition to the incredible library that is Pixar. And just when you think that the geniuses at Pixar can't raise the bar any higher, Cars is absolute proof that computer animation succeeds any previous expectations. Admire the shimmering metallic paint of the cars, the NASCAR-like race at the opening of the film is as exciting as in any recent action flick, and the great palette of colors throughout the movie, mostly visualized through the landscapes and little town of Radiator Springs. Pixar films have always been about the story first, and Cars is no exception. All of the cars have personalities and are characterized to perfection. What's left of the real Route 66 was the inspiration for the computer artists. There is so much amazing detail to admire, it's almost impossible to see it all during a first viewing. Cars is a great looking film, with lots of comedy and some sentimental scenes about fame and fortune; that it isn't what it's meant out to be. Stay for the credits. You'll still be laughing on that drive all the way home.",9,4,5,8 June 2006
The Dark Knight," 'Best Comic Book Based Movie Ever'
","The most anticipated movie of the year finally hits screens this Friday, both in 2-D and IMAX formats. Christian Bale returns as the mysterious and ultra rich Bruce Wayne/Batman. Violence has plagued the streets in Gotham City (which looks a lot like Chicago) and Batman teams up with Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to weed out the crime, in which a new villain arrives, played by the late Heath Ledger, the Joker, unleashing unspeakable horror and crime to the citizens of Gotham City. It becomes the Joker's mission to beat Batman at his own game, therefore making his revenge very personal as he playfully quips, 'Criminals used to believe in things like honor, respect. What doesn't kill you makes you stranger'. I'm totally recommending The Dark Knight to be seen on the biggest screen possible, perhaps at an IMAX screen nearest you. Watching Christopher Nolan's near masterpiece gave me a whole new level of movie-going experience and this fascinating director has definitely set the bar even higher for comic book based movies, which he had already done with his earlier film, Batman Begins. This is the first Hollywood film that used IMAX digital cameras that was partially shot in this new and improved format. I certainly experienced vertigo in certain scenes as the camera hovered above city skyscrapers such as the ones that took place in Hong Kong as Batman stood still on the corner of a building looking down. The Dark Knight delivers in all areas. But let me for a talk for a second about the action scenes. They are definitely incredible! The death-defying stunt work looks pretty authentic and any computer generated imagery was covert and difficult to pin-point. Take for example as Batman's heavy armored vehicle loses all power and it reactivates itself into some sort of over-sized motorcycle; Batman races at breakneck speeds through tunnels and buildings then in and around a 18' wheeler, flipping it violently upside down with Bat-wires. An incredible feat that only last seconds but one where I had to catch my breath. Much has been talked about Ledger's eerie portrayal of the Joker. Ledger loses himself in this role like Marlon Brando did in The Godfather and Anthony Hopkins does in The Silence of the Lambs. It's sorrowfully chilling and definitely that good. He'll for sure be nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar as should the film for Best Picture. At over 2 1/2 hours long, this is definitely one of the longest comic book based movies, but Nolan and his editor, Lee Smith, move things along just fine. There is some fine music by two maestros, James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer, both Academy Award winners; they don't inundate us with heavy piercing sound through the actions scene but instead let those scenes entertain us for themselves. The cinematography and set designs are dark and moody but appropriate for this type of film. With it's technical accomplishments, very fine performances (including Morgan Freeman as technical wizard Lucius Fox and Michael Caine as butler Alfred Pennyworth) most especially by Ledger, The Dark Knight is not only one of the best films of the year (which also works splendidly as a crime thriller) but will go down in history as the best comic book based movie ever.",9,3,8,17 July 2008
