Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worst chapter in a great movie series
","After all the hype made about this movie, it was sure to be a block buster....WRONG! There has never been a better Star Wars movie to walk out of. first let me point out that although this was the movie to explain the start of the sage, well, A New Hope (IV) was meant to be the first SW movie and that wasn't This crap, in fact that was brilliant. unless you're like Comic Book Guy (The Simpsons) who will only see a bad Sci-fi movie 5 times then you will only want to see this once, the first time! but there are some good points about the movie: you get to see how R2-D2 and CP-30 met. The Anakin pod race scene and the Darth Maul fight scene. Unless you're a die-hard Star Wars fan then you'll want to stick to watching the classic SW movies.",5,0,1,1 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," the best Star wars movie
","This is the best Star Wars movie out of the six. The original movie introduces the characters and the amazing storyline and it does it superbly. Although the lack of Yoda in this episode, it remains a classic. Ordinary Farm boy of Tatooine, 'Luke Skywalker' comes across two droids, C3-P0 and R2-D2, and a Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan (Ben) Kenobi, and finds out that his father, Anakin, was a Jedi and is thrust into the Rebellion with the Captain of the 'Millenium Falcon' Han Solo, Chewbacca the Wookie and Princess Leia. Together they give hope that the Rebellion can defeat the Evil Empire and The Sith Lord 'Darth Vader', who from What Luke has heard, killed his father and helped the Sith's rise to power, but we know different. If you're looking for a good film watch this for maximum entertainment.",10,0,0,21 May 2006
