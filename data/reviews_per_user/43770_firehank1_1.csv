Hereditary," Please don't fall for the fake reviews.
","I'll never get those two hours back. I've never reviewed a movie on IMDB before, but it's the only way I can salvage anything from my wasted time. I went to see it because of all the great reviews it's been getting on various websites. It was sooooo boring, not scary, and had crappy special effects. Not to mention the stupid plot and worse ending. I kept waiting for it to be great, but it never happened. You've been warned.",1,14,32,9 June 2018
