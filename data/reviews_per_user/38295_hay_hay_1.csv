Requiem for a Dream," Outstanding
","'Requiem for a Dream' takes a disturbing look at drugs that stays with you for some time.  Although it has been awhile since I last saw this film, the scenes are still very vivid in my mind.  The performances were outstanding. One of the year's best.",10,0,0,1 August 2002
