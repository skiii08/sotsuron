Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A very misunderstood film...
","The editing style of the Phantom Menace is not supposed to occur in real-time. A scene will pause at a point of climax, then take you away from it for more dramatic reasons. Because the following scene is in another time and place, it makes sense to be able to go back to the earlier scene, right where we left off. There are many movies that use this method, for it is a stylistic editing choice which lends more suspense. The droid armies are used because they are what is realistic for the events occuring. Until human clone soldiers come along in Episode II, there is no other way for a small entity (i.e. The Trade Federation, working under Darth Sidious' direction), to take over an entire world in secret. It would be like the Department of Agriculture of our world putting out recruitment posters for troops, for some unspecified take-over. When it is seen how unreliable thousands of droids are on the battlefield, the clones are commissioned.   As for the acting, you should go watch some of the old 1930's Flash Gordon serials. George Lucas has always been emulating these type of films with his own Star Wars trilogy, and has even stated that the wooden acting is on purpose as a homage to those early sci-fi films. And lastly, the narrative of the film is not meant to flow as a focused single story, because all of these separate story threads all contribute to building the entire saga as a whole. Granted, many audience members not very familiar with the original trilogy (i.e. specific lines, et cetera), will question many side-quests, characters, and lines of dialogue of the Phantom Menace, but if you know the original trilogy very well, and you know where the series is heading, then everything makes sense, and is there for a reason. Also, the 'Phantom Menace' is none other than Senator Palpatine (who unbeknownst to even the Jedi, is actually the future Emperor, as well as the current Darth Sidious).",9,3,6,29 November 2003
The Mummy Returns," One of the worst films ever!
","If you were unpleased with the first one, do NOT go see this sequel in hopes of seeing an improvement over everything that bogged that one down. If you disliked the original, all of the things you hated and more will be there to terrorize you. There are SO many elements wrong with this film I could write a book on it, and just may someday provided I could ever sit through it again. The CGI animation is the least of the problems, but that in itself is so wretchedly done that you will either laugh out loud because it is so fake, or else get really annoyed beyond compare. There is a part where I actually wanted the young boy to go outside the temple rather than stay inside trying to revive his dead mother, just so he could be entertained by the cartoon show outside (an army of hundreds of thousands of cartoon jackals line up for battle). If you enjoy a movie that blatantly rips off Home Alone reactions, Titanic embraces on the stern of a ship, a vehicle that flies past the moon ala E.T., or a character dressed in the exact same costume Tom Cruise wore in the orgy scene of Eyes Wide Shut, then go see this movie!! Otherwise be prepared to witness a great travesty. Just think...all the money used to make this 'movie' could have been used to feed and clothe hundreds of thousands of starving children.",2,1,2,6 May 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A masterpiece of cinema...
","My jaw dropped when I read some of these reviews of Dracula (1992). It seems the things people attack in it are things they do not have a background in. The medieval warfare plot is present in the film, because Vlad Dracula was a very real prince in the 15th century Wallachian state bordering Transylvania. In fact, the opening scene is depicted action for action with what happened historically, save for the blood gushing from the cross of course. Bram Stoker drew upon this historical character to drive his novel, for all the baggage such a figure would bring to the plate. As for the rest of the film, the look and style is very rooted in the Symbolist style of the period. In fact, many, many images in the film directly copy well-known Symbolist paintings to a tee. When the dreamy Symbolist style was not being employed, previous incarnations of Dracula on film are referenced. The independent shadow you mention was used in the first Dracula film, Nosferatu (1922). The special-effects employed were all limited to what was available to filmmaking at the time the novel takes place, using puppets, scrims, double-processing, et cetera.    The use of absinthe and filmmaking (two great diversions of Stoker's day), were employed to draw up a parallel between themselves and vampirism. I am not going to go into detail how filmmaking parallels it here, but if you are wondering, go watch Shadow of the Vampire for a detailed example. Absinthe drew many under its dreamlike catatonic spell, and as a result of its potency at the time, destroyed many lives, despite its allure. Bram Stoker's Dracula is one of the greatest artistic accomplishments to come out of Hollywood, and I think, the most beautiful. The stagey acting style mimics the many stage adaptations, as well as the fevered sense of the novel. Add to that the most beautiful costumes, wonderful makeup design, what is perhaps the greatest musical score in cinema history, and it all adds up to be a masterpiece. I think if you want to explore more about the reasons for certain elements, your best route would be to pick up a copy of the book, Dracula: The Film and Legend, which chronicles many of the choices made for this adaptation.",10,2,4,4 June 2003
