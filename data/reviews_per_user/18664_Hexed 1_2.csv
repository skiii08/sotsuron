The Blair Witch Project," Great movie because it can be REAL.
","From the very beginning (I'm talking about the trailers) I was drawn to this film.  When it came time to see it, I was more than drawn in, I was there in person.That's how real it was, which was what the directors wanted, no doubt.  They succeeded, as I was captivated from beginning to end with 'characters' that I could sympathize with.And the ending...it was amazing, unforgettable.  The last scene still haunts me as I write this.  The only complaint that I could possibly make is that after I left the movie I felt ill.  Take some dramamine with you if you plan on seeing this movie, I plan to when I go AGAIN.",9,0,0,9 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not a bad movie...just far from good.
","I was ready for this movie, being a fan of the originals.  I wasn't really expecting anything great out of this flick and that's why I wasn't disappointed when I saw it. The acting from many of the performers wasn't the greatest. The writing was pretty weak.  Yes, it was made for children.  I had to reach into my inner-child in order to finally enjoy The Phantom Menace.The countless special effects filled action sequences are tied together loosely with a plot revolving around Queen Amidala and her planet, Naboo.  And nice special effects they were!  The fact that the movie has the word 'Star Wars' in it will make this mediocre piece of work go down in history, though.",6,0,1,2 August 1999
