Blade Runner 2049," Predictable and boring
",All the vfx and bad actresses and Nazi architecture couldn't save this. It's a pain finishing this movie and I'm glad I didn't waste time and money for a theatre ticket.,3,2,4,5 January 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Completely off the Magic!
","I am completely disappointed with this movie. It lacks in story, characters and 'magic'. There is nothing to be considered magic in an American pre-war atmosphere. And I would never have thought that the US accent would harm so much to this movie, almost as it would be a parody (a cheap one) of a famous movie. Don't get me wrong I love US accent but here it is completely out of place. The characters are weak and also the beasts are mere mix-ups of real animals or horrid mutations, (I have never seen a hypo-rhino with a brain tumour that big or a Puffer-tiger).Honestly you coulnd't come up with beter ideas? Poor creature concepts. It feels like Jk Rowling had a second thought about 'no more Harry Potter movies' and rushed a quick book to make up for lost time.",2,2,6,4 March 2017
