Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," what was George Lucas thinking - SCHMALTZ!!!
","I love Star Wars. Don't get me wrong. I am a fan.  I know the original films very well. The Phantom Menace is an insult to their memory and more insultingly to mine as well. The Star War films are part of my childhood but they were never childish, this is something that cannot be said of The Phantom Menace. It is a cliched downgraded mix of the plot of A New Hope with a few elements of Return of the Jedi thrown in (thing annoying supposedly amusing aliens far removed from the menace of the Mos Eisly Cantina 'I'll be careful', 'You'll be dead' repartee). When I stop feeling sorry for nmyself and other educated fans out there I will feel sorry for the kiddies who although they may like this film now will equate it with the merging masses of action films they have seen in their youth, they will not carry a distict Star Wars memory with them into adulthood like so many of us did with the first trio of movies.",1,3,6,4 June 1999
Sleepy Hollow," the only horror is in the editing...
","surely this film was hacked up by the studio? perhaps not but i feel there were serious flaws in the storytelling that if not attributed to the editing process could only be caused by grievously bad, criminal indeed, writing and directing.i understand the effect burton wished to achieve with the stylised acting similar to the gothic fairytale atmosphere of edward scissorhands, but here unfortunately it falls flat and achieves no mythical depth of tropes but only the offensive tripe of affectation. ie bad acting and shallow characterisation even for a fairytale.finally not that scary, indeed only mildly amusing in its attempts. the use of dialogue as a vehicle for plot background was clumsy and unnecessary. the mystery of who is the headless horseman would suffice, no need for the myth about a german mercenary, although christopher walken did cut a dashing figure but not that menacing - seeing the horsemans head makes him seem far friendlier that a decapitated inhuman nine foot tall spirit as in the original legend.no real rhythm or universal tone was ever established and not a classic in burtons oevure. stilted and clipped as my parting shot...",1,34,64,4 January 2000
