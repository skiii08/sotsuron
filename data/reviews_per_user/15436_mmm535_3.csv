Alien 3," Weak, boring and utterly predictable
","I actually wasted money seeing this movie on pay-per-view. The movie was soooooooooo boring that my brother decided to fall asleep and told me to wake him up when something exciting happened. After seeing this movie, I read in an issue of US magazine, that Sigourney Weaver was responsible for the way the movie was scripted. She demanded that the script not contain any firearms (hence the boring and dank prison environment which unusually had no weapons-go figure). She really messed this Alien pic up big time!!! Aliens success (in my opinion) was that action provided by the weaponary. Also, Alien 3 was more a sorry excuse to end the Alien saga on a wishy-washy sentimental note. For me, the movie failed miserably. The attack scenes are unbelievably predictable. I felt like like I knew 15 minutes in advance of who was going to get killed by the alien. The alien creature itself is rather dull and unimpressive. The plot is geered more towards a soap opera audience than a sci-fi movie. This movie failed to provide anything exciting or rewarding. I remember the printed advertisements for this movie were saying stuff like: '3 times the terror'. GIVE ME A BREAK! This movie was more like 3,000 times the disappointment.My advice, stick to Alien and Aliens for true satisfaction and don't even bother to watch Alien 3!",Null,396,418,17 September 2001
The Thing," An excellent movie!!
","Quite simply, The Thing rocks! This is a most-see movie for horror fans. The movie has an excellent plot with eye-popping visual effects. Kurt Russel acts his role perfectly has a savvy human trying to undermine the intentions of the malicious Thing! If you haven't seen the Thing, go do it now. I have seen this movie at least 25 times and it never ceases to entertain. Perhaps, I wonder, if this movie could be remade using today's state-of-the-art special effects.",Null,0,1,17 September 2001
The Insider," An outstanding movie, not to be missed!!
","After I have seen so many poorly written and directed movies, I was so pleased to see an excellent movie as The Insider. This movie is a superb example of what all movies should have regardless of the genre: well-crafted directing, scripting and acting. The Insider provides an intensely sustained drama from start to finish. Russel Crowe and Al Pacino give superb performances. I was even delighted with Christopher Plummer's performance as Mike Wallace. If you haven't seen this gem of a movie, GO SEE IT!!5 stars!!!",Null,1,1,17 September 2001
