Walk the Line," Well delivered Bio-film.
","Walk the Line is a competent, but not transcendent film that follows the Bio-film format to the letter. The strong points of the film come from the excellent original music sung by Pheonix and Witherspoon, the on-screen chemistry and the impassioned performances by the whole cast. The weakest point of the film is the lack of detail and story content. Cash's struggles were not adequately represented and the film failed to address anything that a fan of his music would find new and interesting. This is a shame, because Cash led one hell of an interesting life. Five out of five for execution, but two out of five for content.",6,0,2,15 January 2006
Ali," Ali is an interesting failure.
","Ali is an interesting failure. A movie about an important historical figure such as Ali could have benefited from a straightforward, energetic approach. However, Mann's more artistic approach might have succeeded had the artistic elements complimented the subject matter. Michael Mann does not effectively create a biographical account, nor does he emphasize the action scenes. Instead, he chooses to make it a self-consciously artistic film. The narrative facts are obscured by the filmmaking which destroys the cohesion of the plot. The only consistent element left to cling to is Mann's characteristic slow pacing. Some of the artistic sequences are quite interesting, taken out of context. However, these lengthy sequences end up taking the place of narrative information that is so important that it hardly seems an appropriate sacrifice. Furthermore, by allowing the pacing of the movie to become so exposed, one cannot help but feel it drag on. One direct criticism I have is that the music was poorly chosen. The movie starts off in a good place with Sam Cooke, but many sequences feature background electronic music (it sounds very modern). If the film had stuck to a period soundtrack, the artistic elements would have tied in with the plot effectively. All of this aside, Will Smith gave an incredible performance as Ali, perhaps the best of his career. It's a shame that Mann did not make a movie to match the honesty of Smith's performance.",3,2,3,5 January 2002
Shaun of the Dead," not exactly a zombie movie
","Shawn of the Dead is not the best zombie movie ever made, nor is it the best romantic comedy. However, it fills both roles so amazingly well that lovers of both genres should be satisfied. That is, unless your movies have to scare the pants off of you. People who love to be scared aren't going to get kicks from this movie. It's more of a fast-paced suspense film with some good fake blood and gore and a feel-good drama going on in the background. Aside from the genre, the film also employs some good story advancement techniques such as the television ads and joke shows that are reminiscent of Verhoeven's work. (total recall/starship troopers) This movie does not attempt to be epic or create some otherworldly or post-apocalyptic dream-scape, but it creates an intimate mood between the small group of survivors who exist in an innocuous suburban enclave, except with zombies. Furthermore, it manages to pull all of it's elements together without leaving anything behind or unfinished. I found it incredibly fun to watch, and that is as good of a measure I can think of for a film. Perhaps it's not the only measure, but we all to have a laugh now and again.",10,1,2,12 March 2005
The Mist," Interesting set-up for a movie that goes nowhere
","I watched this movie because of the good things i have read about it on this site... I guess it was just a slow movie year or something, because this was a boring film. It starts off really good with a post apocalyptic stuck-in-the-supermarket-during-judgment-day kind of vibe, but it doesn't really go anywhere. Instead, the story focuses on the limited interaction between the folks trapped together. For me, this was boring, because i was just waiting for them to leave the whole time. It's like getting stuck in the root menu of DVD or something. nothing ever happens. The cast just slowly learns what we all know from the beginning of the movie, about the origin of the mist, and how it's dangerous to go outside. Boring movie, but some good scenes and good acting all around for what it was. Not a total loss, but not above a 5 out of 10 for me.",5,1,3,5 September 2008
I Am Legend," An enjoyable lightweight viral disaster movie.
","I Am Legend does plenty right, certainly most of the important things to a post-apocalyptic zombie film; it has absolutely breathtaking scenery, the sets (especially the house) are perfect, and the atmosphere is appropriately creepy the whole time. Add all of this up and throw in a strong performance by Will Smith, and you've got a very promising horror film. well... almost. I Am Legend has a really big story, so big that it can't cover all of it's bases in the time given. The movie is relatively short at about an hour and thirty five, and there isn't much time for Smith to explore the interesting and disturbing world he has found himself in. To make things worse, large portions of the film are dedicated to lengthy flashbacks from just before the movie starts that never really seem to be called for or drive the plot in any discernible way, serving only to supplement knowledge of the plot; given the short length of the movie, it hardly seems a worthy sacrifice for some action or, even better, some mystery. Essentially, that's where I am Legend falls short, it doesn't really present a decent mystery or developed drama, and it trades the possibility of delivering non-stop action for some mediocre flashbacks and a simple plot. However, it never really bores, and Will Smith is charismatic enough to elevate the viewing experience to well-above average. But just imagine what could have been if this movie was also well written. As it is, it's a good film that is too short and a bit thin, but it could have been a classic in the horror genre.",6,1,1,30 September 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," great movie, closer in spirit to the books
","The fifth installment in the Harry Potter movies is a satisfying retelling of it's book counterpart. What most impressed me was just how much the cast has grown as actors. All of the main characters have improved dramatically and the newcomers, such as Beatrice Lestrange, were all well chosen for their roles. There is also enough new content to hold the interest of those who have read the book many times over. The new content also succeeds in advancing the story and filling in holes created by missing story elements (elements that were present in the books). I was also really impressed with the way the movie treats the character of Dolores Umbridge, I was nervous that she would appear too silly in the movie, but she is really well done. All in all, my favorite Harry Potter movie so far!",9,0,1,12 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," enjoyable, but flawed by lack of detail
","As an older Harry Potter fan who has read the books, i found 'The Chamber of Secrets' to be enjoyable, but a bit of a let-down after the 'The Sorcerer's Stone.' I understand that the story is far more complicated than the first book, but i do not believe that an appropriate compromise was reached between the mystery and the details of Harry's childhood. It seems as though, not only were the details of the mystery insufficient, but that Harry's coming-of-age has been almost completely ignored. However, in spite of some very bad acting from Draco Malfoy, there are plenty of exciting moments and the movie is fun throughout. They should look into replacing Malfoy as the new Dumbledore is chosen. It would be an added incentive to see the third movie. 7 out of 10 (for a potter fan)",7,0,0,18 November 2002
