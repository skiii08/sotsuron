The Ring," It's like someone mixed 'The Sixth Sense' 'The Shining' and 'Video Dead' together and ended up with a big bucket of crap.
","People liked this? This movie was terrible. It was nothing more than a cliche 'creepy little boy with single mother' horror movie. It had an extremely thin plot littered with holes and irritating loose ends. By the first time boom mic was visible, the movie became impossible to take seriously. The jump scenes were so predictable that my friend actually waited on the edge of his seat for one, and when the screams from the audience came, he got out of his seat and jumped in the air. The most terrifying thing about the movie was that people in the theater were truly frightened by what they saw. It was a comedy for me.",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
