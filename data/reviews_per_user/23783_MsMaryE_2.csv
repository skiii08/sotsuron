Black Swan," Good vs Evil
","A psychological thriller about a ballet dancer's battle with innocence, the end of guarding that innocence, and rival competition. The director encompasses this three-dimensional trait into one gifted, beautifully poised lady named Nina, played by Natalie Portman, whose solo life is domiciled with her smothering and controlling mother Erica, played by Barbara Hershey. They shared one thing in common, ballet. This tradition from mother to child persist without resistance. Nina soar above her mother's failed career. One shocking look into Erica's grimy face, said washout, disappointment and collapse in ones hope for success. Unfortunately dance wasn't the only continuity, so was schizophrenia. Her inner world was suppressed with demons and dark impulses, a cruse Nina learned to live with but never shared. Her strive toward perfection in her ballet and her diet, clearly steered her toward anorexia. For the sake of the movie title, The director, Darren Aronofsky, chose not to place the spotlight on Nina's beautiful swan like movements but, on Nina's downward spiral descent into deep psychosis.The white swan is exquisite, sweet, and pure and the black swan dark, mystical, and bewitching. In order to be the Swan Queen, Natalie Portman had to be all of these characters. The artistic dance director, Thomas, played by Vincent Cassel, knows Nina is the white swan and must push her to become the black swan. In order to accomplish this, Thomas suggests she forget about being perfect. Perfection is not about control, you must try to surprise yourself and the audience. This order undoubtedly forces her to unlock the trapped demons into her world, an experience she has so, so dreaded.The Director's target to give birth to the evil swan was right on point. Natalie skillful acting abilities switching from good to bad-- friendly to hostile and from naive to worldly was just incredible. She laid her emotions out there, haunting us with spontaneous hallucination and phantom sensations. Our vision became blurry with her vision. We could no longer discriminate between real and imagined experiences. This unique concept, To see what a schizophrenic sees, gave insight to her unintentional altered perception. The evil twin, the evil force was pulling her, pulling me.The music was simply magnificent and speaks for itself, Tchaikovsky's 'The Swan'. The music score enhanced by Clint Mansell, uses the dark tones to keep us in tune with the delusions surrounding her virtual reality of violence. It works extraordinarily well throughout the entire movie. As with many others, Tchaikovsky's music has been part of my memory since attending the symphony during grade school, listening to CDs, and movie scores past and present. The whole musical affair is clearly meant to separate good and evil and believe me it struck the right note.Black Swan is intriguing and captivating. I promise, you will not be disappointed, perhaps a little confused. Hopefully, it will arouse your curiosity to listen to its music or see a real ballet performance or perhaps watch 'The Turning Point' where real ballet dancers such as Mikhail Baryshnikov and Leslie Browne perform effortlessly. If it does that, and not focus on weight loss or self-destruction, then we all win and can say, 'It was perfect.'",10,10,19,20 December 2010
Burlesque," Let Me Entertain You
","Burlesque may have started out as a dazzling, lip-sync singing French twist sensation but when a talented girl from a small town takes center stage belching out loud piercing notes screaming with soul, 'You know something got a hold of you and won't let go.'The director starts out with scenes in dingy, crusty locations, overshadowed with filtered sunlight to create an outdated, old fashion look. These scenes failed to capture a unique cinematic vision, instead the views were dark and dull. His blend of melodrama and music worked better than Chicago because singing was sung only on stage. No phantom of the opera to bring tears, just a busting out movie that went straight to the point--I want to sing!Ms small town girl named Ali, played by Christina Aguilera, changed cities but couldn't quite change her waitress uniform. She worked her way to that familiar job, when charmed by neon lights, she opened the door to a new world, Welcome to Burlesque. As she looked around, she watched the bickering and cat fights among the dancers and how shamefully patrons weren't getting their drinks. So, she took charge by befriending Jack the bartender played by Cam Gigandet, then moved from the unemployment line to waiting on tables and serving drinks. Tess, the club owner played by Cher, told her she has great enthusiasm and terrible timing. However, in the midst of all this tension whiplash, Tess told Ali to take off her coat and get to work.Ali studied hard by reading every burlesque book ever written. She demonstrated a fierce determination that she could do every dance, every scene, step by step better than the other girls at the audition . She was impressive and landed the job. Now here's the catch 22, people pay to see the dancers lip sync to the great stars like Marilyn Monroe's 'Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend.' There is no live singing at Burlesque. What is a girl to do with all that vocal talent? Well, she could be lucky to have a vengeful enemy like Nikki who turns off the pre-recorded music during her lip sync stage performance. Surely for Nikki that has to be the biggest mistake, huge mistake, right? Right. So the rest, as they say, is history! Tess rewrites the whole show around Ali's voice and the small town girl is now center stage on Hollywood Sunset Stripe.Cher's performance was better than great, it was awesome. She delivers a warm touchy feeling convincing me she owned the club, she loved the club and she wasn't selling her club. Hard set and beautiful, standing tall and confident, singing ' You Haven't Seen the Last of Me;' Cher is a true goddess, definitive of stage and production. I needed to see more and more of her . You can't get enough of Cher and her makeup, her hair and her famous, I know everything attitude.Christina is the sweetest part of the movie. She worked Burlesque from the beginning to the end with an Eminem's 8 mile state of mind, you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. Without a doubt, she definitely lost herself in the music, the moment, and the dancing. When you know you got it, you go get it. She wore skimpy cultured pearls, juicy bareback couture glittering with diamonds, and holding ostrich feathers only, as she paraded the stage singing slow songs, old songs and hip hop songs. Her roommate Jack, black eyeliner by night, is the movie's secret eye candy. Well built, nice teeth, and shy, he gives us a little touch of burlesque with his steamy and lusty private moves. And of course we need to mention Sean played by Stanley Tucci. He held the movie together or should I say he held Tess together.Burlesque is an eye-popping never boring cinematic experience that will entertain you with grandeur songs from the present and the past. As you experience this razzle dazzle movie, you can actually feel the music. To me, Burlesque mirrors Purple Rain's electrifying energy that generated from a club of talented, struggling performers and a sidekick love affair. Christina and Cher in Burlesque will be remembered like Prince in Purple Rain. You have to see it again and again, because true talent never ages, its ageless. I just loved every mind- blowing performance and I'm sure you will too, so GO see it!!",8,28,38,5 January 2011
