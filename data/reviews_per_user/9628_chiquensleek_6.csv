Casablanca," Moving Love Story
","Casablanca is a very well known movie across the United States. It came out in 1942, just as the was began to end. The plot, which was about World War 2, was very relatable to those during that time of crisis. It shows how much power the Germans really did have over other countries and the people. This love story is very compelling and edgy because the two characters are in a funk that they had a love for each other before, but cannot seem to ever be together because of certain circumstances. The love that Rick has for Ilsa is so unselfish that he makes decisions for her that will affect her life in a good way, causing him to lose the girl he once and does love. This goes to show that many people are willing to give up their feelings for another person's well-being.",Null,0,1,14 October 2011
Citizen Kane," Not my style, but not a bad movie
","Citizen Kane is a very well known movie. It is phenomenally directed. I never really got into the movie as much as others have. I didn't find it that interesting, although it was beautifully shot, I did not really like the plot. It just wasn't my style. But I did have a favorite part which was engaging. The scene where they Kane is out to eat with a big group of people and the dancers and the band came out. It was so out of the loop and not really expected in the film, which is why I liked it because it was so unexpected. My teacher pointed out that they had microphones that were in the ceiling, and you could hear the change in volume as the band would walk underneath the microphone and then walk away and it be suddenly different in volume. I found that to be very interesting. Not a bad movie, just not my style and not a favorite of mine.",Null,0,2,5 December 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," Interesting way or directing
","'The Grapes of Wrath,' is a very well known film based upon the conditions and hardships of the Great Depression. I found it to be very interesting that I could actually tell that some scenes were filmed on a sound stage. The sound gave it away. I noticed that in a scene where Tom and the former preacher were walking 'outside' that when they talked, I could hear their voices echoing. I never have been able to really distinguish between on-scene location and on stage. But, in this movie, surprisingly I was able to because of the echoing. But, the lighting in that scene is awesome! It really captures that its later in the day, going on evening, and there is a storm coming. The camera work is pretty basic. The natural lighting of the candle as Tom, the preacher and Yulie are talking emphasizes the conversation they are all having. Good plot, basic filming, interesting light and the sound in some scenes is not synchronized or recorded right in relation to the location/set.",Null,1,1,18 December 2011
The Graduate," Not what I thought
","When I heard of the movie 'The Graduate,' I thought it was going to be about a college scene, and then how the character pursues what he learned in college and was very successful. Which was not what the movie was about at all. I had always heard the phrase,' Mrs.Robinson, ' and never knew what it was from. But this movie was very interesting in a 'risky' kind of way for the time period. My favorite part about the movie was how awkward Benjamin was. His innocence is taken away when he makes a decision that will affect his future. It was a very flowing plot that kept my interesting throughout. The way that it was shot was also very unique, using ellipses to show how time had past but also making the scenes into a montage was very cool in my opinion.",Null,0,0,5 December 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Brilliant Musical
","I am not a big fan of Musicals when it comes to movies. They always come off as cheesy and very bland. But, 'Singing In The Rain' is a magnificent musical. For those who are unsure about this genre of film, this movie will change your mind. It is the first colored film we have watched in my History of American Cinema class, and also the first musical we watched and I loved it. The dancing blew my mind. Donald O'Connor's character, in my opinion, was the best and made the movie more exciting. His crazy dancing, and off the wall personality was so entertaining and put a smile on my face. The other character who made me laugh was Jean Hagen's needy character. Her part in the movie just made it that more enjoyable because it goes to show that not every 'hollywood glamor' girl is perfect for every roll. It also shows that an ordinary girl like Debbie Reynold's character, does have a shot in the big world! The singing, and dancing were phenomenal. I love the scene with O'Connor and Gene Kelly dancing around the speech teacher!",Null,0,2,12 November 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Fantastic Movie!
","I absolutely love this movie! I have only seen a couple of Jack Nicholson movies, but this movie is definitely one of the best! He is such a natural, real actor that one can really feel for. The different personalities of each character just flow so well together and make the movie so interesting and funny! The plot is so flowing and free. It really engages the audience with its funny dialog, scenes and characters. There is not one boring moment in this movie. It is hilarious and the plot is amazing. Such a well put together movie from the actors, to the plot to the dialog. If the viewer does not know of Jack Nicholson or is not a fan, I feel like this movie will flip that opinion around. He is a very honest actor who is so alive and powerful when he acts!",10,2,4,11 December 2011
