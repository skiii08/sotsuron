The Monuments Men," Very Disappointing Film
","This much anticipated film is a dud. Too bad, as it had the chance to tell one of the more fascinating stories of WWII. A plodding plot drove a dozen viewers from the theater well before the film's end and Mr. Clooney wasted what could have been, at the very least, an entertaining cast. The thinly developed characters - Bill Murray seemed to have no more than four or five lines - gave the actors nothing with which to work and the viewer next to no emotional connection. I was hoping for a somewhat serious take with a few dashes of Oceans 11/12 and Kelly's Heroes spliced in, but found only one of the more disappointing films of the last few years. And the movie's fixation on cigarettes was a bit over the top. Yes, smoking was a big part of a soldier's life in WWII, but making a smoke part of the supporting cast is a little much. Any interest in this film is probably best sated by waiting for its release on cable. Not recommended.",1,62,85,14 February 2014
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," A treasure
","Almost as good as the book, which is high praise. No super-heroes (thanks), nothing blows up (thanks). Well paced, exquisite cast. I know it's hard to not like kids in movies, but the young girl that played Kit simply demands your emotion. I felt like I did after seeing My Brilliant Career or films in that vein. Findlay, Parkinson and Wilton? Perfect. See it.",9,2,4,12 August 2018
