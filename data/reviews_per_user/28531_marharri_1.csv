Casablanca," 'A Brief Encounter in Casablanca?'
","The classic second world-war film of love, separation, missed opportunity and uncertainty in a world whose order is collapsing with each day. This has more action than UK's 'Brief Encounter', but the on-screen tension between the main male and female lead is just as intense (if not more so). They are both stories of people falling in love - who shouldn't fall in love, and as with all great films you have to wait until the final scenes to find out who gets the girl. Casablanca has much more humour than Brief Encounter, but then it was filmed a long, long way from any actual military conflict. An excellent film to watch on a winter's eve on a sofa with your favourite munchies and no visitors.",10,2,3,12 February 2005
