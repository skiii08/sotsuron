Howl's Moving Castle," Unique, Magical and Enveloping experience
","In a nutshell this film is: Unique Involving Interesting Exciting Emotional Well scripted AmazingEver since watching 'Spirited Away' and getting semi-hooked on this guys movies, I felt that bettering or even equalling this feat was nigh on impossible. The thing is, it didn't better it, or equal it - it was just so incredibly different yet so amazingly awesome that you could not match the two together. I have since watched 'The Girl who Leapt Through Time' which again stands alone. Absolutely breath-taking movie!!!I cannot recommend this movie enough, or any of the three movies which I have mentioned above. This has lead me to purchase more of his movies and start a Japanese anime section in my DVD collection, something I never thought I would do!",9,0,1,12 October 2010
Paranormal Activity," Pretty damn scary
","I am not one to be scared of horror movies; I really enjoy the horror movie genre, but there are very few that touch a nerve with me and make me feel a little nervous, but this was one of them.I got it on the offchance and took it on the basis of reviews but I felt it was going to be one of those terrible movies like the other one where they run around the forest screaming...When it first started, I felt that my instincts were right and the first thirty minutes of the movie were slow, laborious and pretty uninteresting.As the movie went on, you felt for the woman in the movie but rolled your eyes at the guy; he was in all honesty a bit of a muppet and when they were in deep trouble the guy would more often than not reach for the camera rather then helping his partner.As the plot unfolded, it became more creepy (the Grudge type creepy - Japanese not American) and then it became scary.The final finale, was something that was quite unexpected and was pretty shocking. Even had nightmares about this and haven't had them because of horror films since my early years.I would recommend this movie to people who like scary movies, but in particular about possession and demonology. Those who like the hack and slash genre, or zombie movies maybe this is not for you, or if you are easily scared - it is probably not for you either.",8,0,0,23 June 2011
1408," Very solid horror film
","First of all, growing up with John Cusack - I have been one of his skeptics right from the outset with his romcom/teen flicks that spurted out in the 80s and 90s. I watched a film of his which was recommended from a friend a couple of years ago because he said it was great. It wasn't and only compounded my dislike for movies which he appears in.Herein lies the dilemma, I am a big Stephen King fan - but I don't like John Cusack - so I have put this film off for a few years.the first point is that it is not about the year 1408 which is what I assumed from the cover of the item, it is about room 1408 a hotel room number.Firstly, to put the ghosts to bed above. John Cusack's performance was nothing short of outstanding. He was believable, you sympathised with his situation and the range of emotions you went with him was absolutely spot on. Well done Mr Cusack! you have restored my faith in you! Samuel L Jackson's 'Jool's' performance has been identical in whatever role he has played in. But with his one dimensional acting, it is always pretty decent, he does a job.So onto the movie, storyline - solid, twists and turns - solid, entertainment value - solid, acting - solid. Scare factor: pretty damn high!!!! I have watched many Stephen King movies (Shawshank being the best) and read many of his books also (IT being the best). As a horror movie, this ranks right up there with Misery and given the fact that the level of horror movies out there that can possibly scare you is very low (Paranormal Activity, The Grudge 1 & 2 - (Japanese), Let the Right One in (Swedish) - do not skip this movie!!! Fantastic!",9,0,1,23 February 2012
