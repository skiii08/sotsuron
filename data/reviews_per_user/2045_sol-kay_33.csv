Lucky Number Slevin," It all started with a 'Sure Shot' at the racetrack
","(There are Spoilers) Clever elaborate but a bit complicated crime drama/thriller that covers a span of over two decades which is the time it took for everyone involved in a bloody massacre after a fixed race, at the Aqueduct Race Track in Queens NY, to come full circle. Back in the fall of 1979 Max a degenerate gambler desperate for money gets the word from a race-track tipster and close friend of his Uncle Sol,a big-time New York horse player that the number seven horse in the tenth race at Aqueduct that afternoon has been fixed, or secretly drugged, to win the race. Max then goes to his local bookie, Roth, to bet $20,000.00 on #7 on the nose. Leading all trough the stretch the number seven horse suddenly collapses and dies just before he hit's the finish line! With Max now broke and Roth in hot water with the mob for taking his bet both their lives on the line if they doesn't pay up.This is a story that a Mr. Goodkat tells a total stranger at the almost deserted airport lounge before he, in what looks like to make a point, murders him. This sets up a chain of events that has the murdered mans, a petty gambler named Fisher, friend Slevin come to visit him after he's been forced out of his place by the city marshal. Slevin is mistaken for Fisher when he goes to his apartment and is roughed up by two hoods sent there by The Boss to pick up a $96,000.00 gambling debt that the deceased Fisher owes him.Slevin not being able to convince The Boss that he isn't Fisher and at the same time not having the money to pay the head gangster back is forced to make a deal with him. Slevin agrees to knock off the gay son, Yitzchok, of The Boss' chief rival for control of the crime syndicate in the city The Rabbi. Slevin is later apprehended by two of The Rabbi's hoods and brought to his mid-town Manhattan penthouse. there he's told that not only is he in debt to The Boss for $96,000.00 but also to him for another $33,000.00! This has the unlucky Selvin now stuck between a rock and a hard place with his life not being worth a plug nickel!We keep seeing Goodkat, who turns out to be a top-notch hit-man for hire, pop up all throughout the movie not really knowing just what his connection is with The Boss and The Rabbi as well as the confused and bewildered Slevin. Everyone involved in this strange arraignment have one thing in common that in the end ties all the looses ends in the movie together; the what's now mythical fixed tenth race at Aqueduct some twenty five years ago!A lot like 'The Usual Suspects' the movie 'Lucky Number Slevin' has a storyline that has a number of different characters from the police mobsters bookies and local horse players woven into it that takes a while to unravel itself. Slevin at first comes across as an innocent and unlucky dupe, and victim of circumstances, who's caught up with things that he has no control off. But as the movie reveals more and more of it's secrets you somehow begin to realize that he's not the person that you at first thought that he was.The connection between Slevin and the two hoodlums, The Boss & The Rabbi, is also not as accidental as it seems. You start to notice that he's setting up the two for something but why and for what? Slevin also has a connection with the mysterious hit-man Goodkat who's beginning to look more like the one that's possibly behind this entire grand and murderous plan.The film stretches the creditability of it's story a lot by everything going off almost without a hitch with the exception of Slevin's live-in girlfriend Lindsey which in the end turned out to be very lucky for her. Unlike in the 1995 block-buster and highly popular 'The Usual Subjects' the surprise ending, that took over 15 minutes, didn't leave it's audience up in the air thinking that they were watching and listening to a sloppy and made story, by the person telling it, just in order to be shocked or confused by it. The surprise ending in 'Lucky Number Slevin' was a lot more believable and and at the same time shocking then you would have expected it to be and has you going back to see the movie again to spot all the missed clues that you at first overlooked.",7,3,11,14 April 2006
Lifeboat," Dnka Schon
","***SPOILERS*** Far more effective then almost all of the films made during WWII in Hollywood in it showing the dreaded Nazis or Germans as formidable enemies not mindless brute's whom we ,the good guys, easily out think and fight to the point where you begin to wonder, in spite of the Nazis amazing military success in the early years of WWII, how did they even happen to get that far in the first place.After being sunk and it's passengers shelled by a Nazi U-Boat in the North Atlantic the U-boat itself is hit by allied naval fire and sunk. As the survivors of the passenger ship assemble on a life boat they get an unexpected new passenger or visitor the captain of the U-boat that sunk and shelled them Willie, Water Slezak. Debating if to throw the 'water rat' overboard or keep him as a POW the people on the lifeboat are convinced by both the high class and sophisticated writer and critic Connie Porter, Tallulah Bankhead, and industrialist Ritt Rirtterhoue,Henry C. Hull, to keep him alive. Since as Ritt says were not the inhuman savages that he his.As the people on the life boat soon find out that not only Willie speaks perfect English he's, by being a U-boat captain, also very helpful in their survival at sea. But what they later realize is that Willie is only interested in his own survival not theirs. He's steering the lifeboat to a pre arranged rendezvous with a Nazi supply ship not to the island of Bermuda as he's been telling them all along. And when rescued by the German supply ship they'll all end up in a Nazi concentration camp where for the most part they won't survive the war!***SPOILERS*** It's when Willie gets a bit too over confident in his actions that he gives himself away. Thinking that he's a member of the Master Race and the passengers on the life boat are nothing but sub humans Willie makes his mistake by shoving the wounded and helpless American seaman Gus Smith, William Bendix, overboard in order to lighten the load. Confidently feeling he can put this one, the murder of Gus, over on his shocked fellow boat-mates the outraged passengers storm Willie and deep six him instead. Finally about to be rescued by a US naval destroyer who just sunk the German supply that was about to 'rescue' them up pops another German sailor survivor from the sunken ship, William Yetter Jr, with the same ideas that Willie had in taking control of the life boat. But this time around the now wiser passengers on the boat don't let their guard down like they did before. Which to their benefit guarantees their survival as well as the befuddled , in thinking that they'll throw him overboard, German sailor.P.S Alfred Hitchcock got a lot of criticism for making out Willie the German U-boat captain the real brains behind the shipwrecked passengers surviving in their ordeal at sea. But as Hitchcock correctly explained in that by underestimating your enemies you give then the edge to defeat you! Which is exactly why the Germans were so successful in the beginning and even end of WWII by them inflicting far more losses on the victorious allies, in some case like on the critical Eastern Front as much 8 to 1 in their favor, then they suffered in return!",7,1,1,13 December 2012
Fight Club," Surrealistic Dreams
","******SPOILERS****** The movie 'Fight Club' starts off where it's about to end as Jack the narrator, Edward Norton, looking the worst for ware, recites his story that led him up to where it got him to that point.Living the life of a 90's yuppie, enslaved by his job and his material possessions, Jack developed a very bad case of insomnia due to the hours he worked and lifestyle he led that made him go for medical attention. Going to see a doctor for p Jack is told that his insomnia is not the end of the world. If he wants to see real suffering to go to a testicular cancer support group and what he sees and hears from those unfortunates there would make him forget he problems. Taking the doctors advice Jack go to that support group and is struck by the suffering that those inflicted by that terrible disease go through. He develops a friendship with one of the members of that group Big Bob Paulson, Meat loaf, a former body builder. Because of his heavy steroid use Big Bob not only lost his testicles to cancer but his wife and two sons as well as his money. Not only did Jack feel he was doing something constructive, by crying along with Big Bob, it also help him cure his insomnia. Jack started going to all kinds of support groups during his time off from work and tried to help those needing his support. Jack also helped himself by his very giving comfort and help to those that needed it. At the meetings Jack noticed a woman Marla, Helena Bonham Carter, attending the same meetings that he attended. It became obvious to Jack that she was not suffering the traumas, like testicles cancer, that those at the meetings were suffering from. It also made Jack very conscious of himself who was doing the same thing.All this brought Jack's insomnia back with a vengeance and one night he confronted her about being a 'tourist' and not being honest in attending these group meetings. Coming to a decision with Marla not to attend the same group meetings they both exchange phone numbers to keep in touch. Later on one of Jack many plane trips, that's part of his job, he finds himself sitting next to a very interesting man Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt. Tyler happens to have the exact same suitcase that Jack has. Tyler is everything that Jack wishes he could be; free independent and not stuck up with the yuppie lifestyle that Jack so much wants to get away from but can't. After the plane lands two things happens to Jack that changes his life forever. His suitcase is missing in the baggage department and when he goes home to his high-rise condo he sees that it was blown to pieces by an explosion. This sets the stage that led him to get closer to Tyler and at the same time to get involved with Tyler's pet project the weekly Fight Club matches. These strange events started in the basement of a local bar and also brought Marla back into Jacks life, for better or for worse. The Fight Club matches also revealed something very deep and personal about Jack that was locked deep in his sub-conscious mind; they changed Jack forever in his thoughts and actions. In depth and surrealistic film about couping with the stress of modern life and how the mind works in ways that we can never understand to get us through situations that seem almost impossible to handle. Explosive ending shows how ones suppressed and constrictive mind can become mightier then the sword when it unleashes itself on an unsuspecting public.",8,2,6,4 January 2004
42," The Brooklyn Dodgers aren't going to change our way of life.
","The Second World War over and the professional baseball players were coming back home to play but a new war was about to begin that at the time no one expected. The war to brake the color barrier in baseball that's been in effect for at least the last 50 years. And it was returning US Army veteran Let. Jackie Roosevelt Robinson, Chadwick Boseman, who was the person chosen by Brooklyn Dodger owner Branch 'Rick-a-Dink' Rickey, Harrison Ford,to do it! Rickey who although was a part, as a player manager and owner, of the segregated baseball's Major Leagues for some 40 years was deep down inside a true not phony liberal at heart and always wanted to tap the reservoir of fine black baseball players from the then Negro league and bring them into the majors. Now in late 1945 it now seemed the right time for Rickey to do it. And the person he chose was 26 year old Negro League's Kansas City Monarch infielder Jackie Robinson. As history was soon to prove Rickey couldn't have been more right in whom he choose.Jackie given a chance to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers' top minor league club the Montreal Royals in 1946 tore up the league winning the batting title with a .344 average and it's MVP, Most Valuable Player, award. What was even far more of an accomplishment for Jackie is that he was able to withstand all the racial slurs as well as threats to him and his wife Rachal, Nicole Beharie, and family members to achieve that feat. At first not at all that sure to be on the 1947 Dodger roster Jackie did in fact make it, he ended up batting over .600 in spring training, an on baseballs opening day of that year April 15 Jackie stepped up to the plate against the Boston Barves and history was made: The color barrier in Baseball was not only broken that day but forever after.The film '42' depicts the 1947 Brooklyn Dodger season with Jackie Robinson not only trying to win the National League Pennant for his team those 'Loveable Bums' the Brooklyn Dogeres but also win over his teammates who, with many of them from the south, not all that eager to be on the same baseball field, much less team, together with him. As for the Dodgers' opponents it was the Philadelphia Phillies managed by the ex-Brooklyn Dodger infielder Ben Chapman, Alan Tudyk, who gave Jackie most of his troubles with his racial heckling and even at times tried to have Jackie criminally assault, in front of thousands witnesses or fans, him by having his teams pitchers throwing at Jackie's skull! That before the introduction of batting helmets in professional baseball.It took far more courage on Jackie's part to keep his cool and not take matters into his own hands then batter those, who both mentally and physically abused him, over their heads with a baseball bat. Which in one case in the film he broke against the clubhouse wall.Jackie, who was named rookie of the year in 1947, did together with his team the Brooklyn Dodgers bring the National League pennant to Brooklyn in 1947 beating out the previous pennant winners the Saint Louis Cardinals. But far more then that Jackie proved Branch Rickey's experiment of bringing black and later Latino ballplayers into the Major leagues to be not only be a total success but the right thing to do as well. P.S '42' the title of the movie was the uniform number that Jackie Robinson wore during his entire 10 seasons as a Brooklyn Dodger; He wore uniform #9 as a Montreal Royal in 1946. Since 1997 the 50th anniversary of Jackie breaking the color barrier in baseball uniform #42 has the distinction of being the only number retired from all of professional baseball.Almost but not quite as big a feat as Jackie stepping up to the plate on that sunny April afternoon in Brooklyn's Ebbets Field and changing the course of professional baseball history forever.",8,2,2,23 May 2013
The Fifth Element," Brooklyn cab driver saves the world in futuristic heart thumping thriller
","****SPOILERS*** Every 5,000 years Evil is unleashed on the Universe that if not checked will destroy everything there is in existence. In the summer of 1914 with nothing but war and destruction to look forward to on earth aliens landed near the ancient Egyptian ruins to retrieve the four magical stones. The stones represent the four elements, water earth wind & fire.They were to be put away to avoid from being destroyed until three hundred years in the future. That's when Evil is to be unpleased and where they'll be needed to combat it with the help of a catalyst the critical fifth element, the perfect human being, to defeat it.It's now three hundred years later and Evil, in the form of a massive fireball, is headed towards earth threatening to knocked the blue and green planet out of it's orbit and destroy every living thing on it. The earth enters into a battle between good and evil. Evil is represented by the greedy and immoral Emanuel Zorg, Gary Olman, who with the help of the alien Mondoshawans is determined to get his hands on the four ancient stones, elements,to keep them from fusing together with the fifth to prevent the fireball from crashing into earth. Good is represented by Father Vito Cornelius, Ian Holm, who knows that time is very short in preventing evil from prevailing and knows that without the important fifth element evil will be impossible to stop. Like in almost every important event over the course of history it takes an obscure person being taxi driver and former special forces major Korban Dallas, Bruce Willis, to put all the pieces together. Dallas almost single handedly save the world but he couldn't do it without a passenger that dropped in, laterally, on the backseat of his cab. A reconstructed alien Leeloo, Milia Jovovich, the elusive Fifth Element.With Zorg desperately trying to get the important four stones he's stymied at every turn together with his bumbling alien allies. Dallas is given the assignment to find the stones by Presient Linberg, Tommy Tiny Liser. The intelligence report he gets is that there's a good chance that the stones are hidden somewhere at Fhloston Paradise cruse spaceship. Dallas is fixed, by the secret service, to win a contest to get a trip for two, together with Leeloo, to Fhloston. On the spaceship he discovers that the stones are in the possession of the resorts main attraction singer Diva Plavalagunma, Malwenn Lebesco. The second half of 'The Fifth Element' explodes with the force of a super nova as Dallas and Father Cornelius ,not to mention Leeloo, have it out with the forces of evil represented by Zorg and Co on the cruse ship with almost everyone there ending up vaporized. Zorg loses the support of the Mondoshawans when Dallas knocks off their fearless leader, who was holding Father Cornelius hostage. Leaving them as helpless as a body without a head or brain. Zorg is left on the Fhloston Paradise pleasure cruse spaceship, as Dallas & Co.exit it, that detonates in a fairy explosion from a bomb that he and his alien cohorts planted there. It's now up to Dallas together with Leeloo and Father Cornelius and his young assistant David, Charlie Creed-Miles, as well as the Fhloston Paradise Master of Ceremonies Ruby Rhod, Chris Tucker, to get back to the Egyptian ruins. To find and put all the pieces together, the five elements, and hope that they have enough time left to do it before the earth is reduced to a burning cinder.Corny but extremely entertaining movie that you can't at all take seriously. Just sit back and enjoy the show with a tongue and cheek performance by Bruce Willis as Korben Dallas. Dallas in the movie lost his job as a cab driver and his wife, who ran off with his lawyer, as well as having his nagging mother not leaving him alone for even a moment constantly threatening to throw herself into traffic. In the end all that pales by comparison to what he's up against in his heroic effort to save the world from the forces of evil both on earth as well as in deep space.",9,0,1,17 April 2006
The Natural," Pick me out a winner Bobby
","****SPOILERS**** Wanting to be a professional baseball player since he first picked up a baseball as a little boy Roy Hobbs, Robert Redford, was on his way to becoming one when he was shot and almost killed by a unstable young woman fan whom he met the day before on a train traveling to Chicago where he was to be signed to play for a major league team. With all of his hopes of becoming a major leaguer dashed and a faded memory at 19 Hobbs, 16 years later, now at the age of 35 is back from playing a year of semi-pro ball to play in the big leagues and see if he still has it as a middle-age rookie and if he can make the team. Playing anywhere he's needed, on the bottom-dwelling New York Knights, and hoping against hope that the manager Pop Fisher, William Brimley,will put him in the lineup. Pop does reluctantly only to find out that Roy was heaven sent to not only win the pennant for the Knights but to save him from being brought out by a bunch unscrupulous shysters and gangsters from his share of stock he has in the team.At times corny but still very moving story that despite its unbelievable plot is based on a true story that's almost as incredible as the movie itself. On the evening of June 14, 1949 Phillie first baseman Eddie Waitkus was gunned down in his hotel room by a crazed female fan and admirer. Waitkus with a bullet in his gut was left almost bleeding to death with his future as a professional baseball player non-existent. In only a year Waitkus came back, literary from the dead, to guide the Phillie 'Whiz Kids' to the 1950 National League pennant! The 'Whiz Kids' Won it on the last day of the season, like Roy Hobbs' Knights did in the movie, against the heavily favored Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field.A real crowd pleaser with Robert Redford as Roy Hobbs out to prove to himself, as well as the sports world, that he still has what it takes to be a professional baseball player and comes across his old girlfriend Iris, Glenn Close. Iris unknown to Roy had and is raising his 15 year-old son Ted, Robert Rich III. The movie 'The Natural' has Roy torn between sweet and caring Iris and party girl and gold-digger Memo Paris, Kim Basinger,who together with the sleazy owner of the Knights Judge Prosky and big time bookie and gangster Gus Sands, Darren McGavin, wants Roy to throw the final game with the Pittsburg Pirates. This in order to put out Pop and make a killing betting against the heavily favored Knights.Playing his heart and guts out Roy's past injury comes back to not only haunt but possibly kill him as his stomach wound opens up causing him to miss three games that the Pirates won. With the pennant on the line Roy, despite orders from his doctor not to, returns for the final do or die game at Knights Stadium and ends it, and his career, with a hot and sizzling Forth of July explosion on a cool windy and lighting struck October evening.Predictable but still heart-lifting and exciting movie 'The Natural' ranks right up there with the best baseball, as well as sports, films ever made. 'The Natural' both beautifully and touchingly shows how the human spirit can overcome every obstacle that's thrown in front of it, natural or man made, when it frees itself from all the fears and negativity that's around it.",9,29,41,8 April 2006

The Day After Tomorrow," Natures answer to Mankind's excesses
","****SPOILERS**** Even though the reviews of the movie 'The Day after Tomorrow' are anything but earth-shaking the film is far better then the similar movies of world-wide destruction.'The Day after Tomorrow' does not follow the usual End-of-the-World scenarios like Nuclear wars Meteor Showers and Alien Invasions. Its story is about the very real danger of the earth itself striking back at Mankind that has been abusing it. Striking back with such a destructive fury that it would put the most arrogant cocky and hubristic of us back in our place as scared terrified and humble human beings in us being petrified with fear of the powerful forces of Nature that we have no control of. A new Ice Age is dawning on the Earth starting with the melting of the great ice cover over the continent of Antarctica. After some two hundred years since the beginning of the industrial revolution the earth has finally had enough of being abused by mankind's greed and ignorance of it's environment. These abuses trigger a series of major earth changes that are of monstrous proportions. They hit the Human Race with such force that it dwarfs anything that man has ever imagined of written about in all the thousands of End-of-the-World books and narratives dating back to Biblical times.Antarctica is breaking up and some of the pieces of ice flowing up the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are the size of the state of Rhode Island. These ice flows block the warm ocean currents like the Atlantic Gulf Stream which causes the ocean water temperatures to drop as much as 13 degrees in just a matter of days. As this is happening the air in the upper North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans is becoming lighter and with the melting of the ice absorbs the water vapor. This ends up forming rain clouds that pelt places on the earth ,like Southern Japan and India, with ice and snow storms. Gigantic snow hurricanes and typhoons begin forming in Northern Siberia England Greenland and Canada due to the low pressure and humidity from the melting ice. The middle areas of the earth, some 1,000 miles above the earths Equator, like California in cities like Los Angeles and their surrounding areas are hit by enormous cyclones because of the dramatic drop of barometric pressure. These cyclones link up and unite as they pick up strength becoming unimaginable forces of death and destruction. Picking up strength as they start to roll across the earth wiping cities and towns with hundreds of thousands of people off the map. In cities in the US North-East the meting ice forms hundreds of giant rain clouds that burst open into Biblical-like downpours that last for days on end. The rains together with the raising ocean water levels sweep into the lowlands and northern coastal cities like Boston and New York drowning tens of thousands of people. The bitter arctic winds that follow these northern monsoons freeze the flooded land covering it with a sheet of ice with a thickness of as much as three to five miles deep! What follows is super cold air from the northern areas that kill and quick-freeze anything that it comes in contact with. The special effects in the movie are State-of-the-Art realism and in many ways as real as what we read in the newspapers and see on the TV news. The lead character in the movie Dr.Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), a leading expert of earth's meteorological changes, timely warnings to those leaders of the nations of earth to stop ill-treating the worlds environment in order to prevent ecological calamities like the one that just happened were ignored. Dr. Hall promised his son Sam, Jack Gyllehall, early in the film never to leave him alone. Later separated from him by 250 miles of frozen tundra and never-ending blizzards, he travels mostly on foot to New York City to rescue not only Sam but his friends and a number of stranded New Yorkers on the upper floor of the frozen and snow covered New York City Main Public Library. In the movie we see what we can do by not living in harmony with the forces of Nature that not only rule the earth but the entire Universe. There's a massive migration from the uninhabitable Northern Hemisphere to the south by millions of survivors of this major ecological disaster. Rebuilding their civilization as well as their lives the peoples of the Earth learn the values of living in peace not only with themselves but living in peace with their planet as well. The President of the United States Pres. Blake, Perry King, perished in a snow storm trying to leave,with his cabinet, the ice-locked city of Washington D.C. At the end of the movie the former Vice President and now President Becker speaks to the people of the United States and the world on TV and radio. Pres. Becker gratefully thanks the people of the southern, and mostly third world, nations for allowing the people of the frozen and snow covered north in their countries. Telling the worlds peoples that with the help of God the people of Earth will in the future have the foresight wisdom and courage to not let cataclysms ever happen again. Pres. Becker ends his speech saying that it was wrong for him not to do what he could have done in preventing the horrors that just happened. For that he's very very sorry and you can see that what he said came straight from his heart. But by then the damage was already done and nothing even Pres. Becker's heart felt apology can change that.",8,0,0,4 June 2004
Zodiac," Luna-tic fringe
","****SPOILER ALERT**** The movie 'Zodiac' chronicles some 40 years of the statewide hunt for the notorious Zodiac Killer. The man who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960's up until his last 'chiper' or coded letter back in 1978 and even beyond that.Having become the 20th century US equivalent of 19th century's England Jack the Ripper the Zodiac killer, who may be dead by now, may very well go down in criminal history as one of the most prolific and unidentified killers of all time.The movie 'Zodiac' tries very hard to stick to the facts which makes it very hard to follow at times. Since the facts, unlike a number of fictitious movies about the same subject, are as confusing as the mysterious killer himself. About a month after gunning down at a local Vallejo Calif lovers lane Darlene Ferrin, who died, and Mike Mageau, who survived, the San Francisco Chronicle, or Examiner in real life, received this cryptic letter by the person who claimed responsibility for the shootings.The paper's ace reporter Paul Avery was put on the case but the pressure of tracking down and identifying the killer was just too much for him. Avery later ended up becoming one of the people on the Zodiac's hit list in a Halloween card that the killer sent him. This has Avery go off the deep end and end up a helpless alcoholic quiting his job and living on a boat where he eventually drank himself to death.It was the combination of the Chronicle's political cartoonist Robert Graysmith and SFPD inspector David Toschi who ended up picking up the ball that Avery dropped and ran with it in trying to find the killer. That had Insp. Toschi almost drummed out of the department in being accused, unjustifiably, of faking one of the Zodiac's letters! This, SFDP's internal affairs suspected, was in order for Insp. Toschi to get his superiors on the police force to give him more manpower and money to do his job.As for Graysmith he did uncover a number of clues about the Zodiac's identity, that he later had published in his best selling book, but they all for the most part lead to a dead end ! With the suspected killer, after being completely cleared by the San Francisco Police, dying some ten years later at age 58 of a heart attack. That was after, as seen in the movie, he was positivity identified by one of his surviving victims Mike Mageau in early 1991! You wonder why it took the SFPD all this time, some 22 years after he was gunned down, to get Megeau to identify by pointing the so-called killer, after he was exonerated, out in a grainy mugshot! When he could have done it by facing him in person, or in a lineup, while he was still alive and a prime suspect in the Zodiac killings!The Zodiac went on to murder at least two more people and seriously wounding a third, in a murderous knife attack,in the movie until he just faded out of sight! With only his occasionally cryptic letters sent to local newspapers keeping him on the front pages. It's been speculated that the Zodiac killer had murdered some 30 to 50 people since his admitted rampage against society began back in 1963; Six years before the Ferrin/Mageau shooting on July 4, 1969. But the Zodiac is only credited in the movie, and by the SFPD, of only 5 killings that's one less then those of the his New York City rival, in serial murder, The Son of Sam! This must have really hurt his already, with all the free publicity he was getting, very inflated ego as him being one of the greatest, together with the likes of John Gacy & Theodore Bundy, serial killers of all time!You really couldn't expect that much from the movie 'Zodiac' since it's universally known that the Zodiac Killer has never been as much as identified or, if he's in fact already dead, caught and made to face justice for his crimes. The film in its over two and one half hours running time did educate its audience in how difficult it is, even with the most up to date and state of the art crime fighting science, to capture an intelligent and murderous psycho when he, despite his enormous ego, doesn't slip up and, like in most cases, lead the police straight to his front door!",7,1,3,20 August 2008
We Were Soldiers," Dead or Alive we'll all come home together
","***SPOILERS*** It's November 1965 and the US military's new formed 7th Calvary, the same unit commanded by Gen. George Custer at the Little Big Horn in 1876, is about to get its baptism in blood & fire in the Central Highland's La Drange Valley of Souh Vietnam. It's there where a division of battle hardened North Vietnamese regular troops reinforced by squads of Viet-Cong guerrillas are to meet them in what was to become the bloodiest US Military engagement since the end of he Korean War.Ferried into combat by helicopter gunships the 7th Calvary finds itself pinned down by murderous enemy fire as soon as its troops dis-bark from their aircraft. It up to US Army Let. Col Hal Moore, Mel Gibson, to not only complete his mission of wiping out all enemy resistance in the Central Highlands but bring his men, dead alive and injured, back to base at all cost. But the North Vietnamese troops and their Viet-Cong allies have other things in store for them. Which is to wipe out to the last man the entire 7th Calvary like they, as Viet Minh guerrillas, did to a unit of French Foreign Legionnaires 11 years ago in 1954.Non-stop action as US Calvary units slug it out with the communist forces who are determined to end the US involvement in Vietnam almost as soon as it starts. Having trained for their mission at Ft. Benning Georgia the 7th Calvary were ready for action in the highlands and jungles of South Vietnam but what they found in the fanatical and suicidal attacks by the communist troops were far more bloody and intense then what they ever expected. In the four days, November 14-18 1965, of combat the US suffered almost 300 killed and 500 wounded with the 7th Calvary taking the brunt of the losses. It was on the last day of fighting with the 7th Calvary down to it's last man and bullet that the US Army and air force finally came to its rescue. In them opening up a massive artillery and air bombardment that finally dislodged and had turn tail the attacking North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong forces.A quite and reserved, or strong and silent type, Mel Gibson was never better then in the role of Let. Col. Hal Moore who together with his top kick or sergeant major Basil Pulmley, Sam Elliott, kept their men from panicking by them being right out there, in the thick of the fighting, with them on the front lines and leading by example. Among those US soldiers who in the end didn't make it back was 2nd Let. Jack Geoghegan, Chris Kline, who despite being deeply religious and not wanting to take lives ended up losing his own in trying to save a fellow 7th Calvary men who was badly wounded. There's also 5th generation US soldier reporter and photographer for Stars & Stripes Joe Gallaway, Barry Pepper, who's willing if necessary to lose his life by him being a conscientious objector but not taking someone else's even an enemy soldier who's out to kill him. It's Gallaway who ends up getting the story of his career coupled with dozens of photos of the fighting to be dispatched and showed to those of us back home that the war in Vietnam wasn't the cakewalk that we were lead, by our leaders in the White House Congress and the Pentagon, to believe that it was. The Vietnam War went on for some ten years and costing 58,000 US servicemen and women lives by the time it finally ended. And sadly enough it ended with the North Vitnamese and Viet-Cong on the winning side!P.S The saddest and most touching scenes in the movie has nothing to do with it's combat sequences but the scenes with the wives of those who fell in the fighting. It was them who were to get a knock on the door and told by official letter the heart breaking and tearful news from the Secretary of the Army': I'm Sorry to Inform You'.",8,1,2,30 May 2013
The Bodyguard," Cut to commercial! Cut to commercial!
","***SPOILERS*** Kevin Costner as ex secret service agent Frank Farmer looks genuinely board stiff as his role demands him to be guarding the body of singer and actress Rachel Marron, Whitney Houston, as her bodyguard in 'The Bodyguard'. Coaster or Farmer walks around looking so deadpan throughout most of the movie that he seems to be suffering from a serious case of shell shock from his previous job as a secret service agent. It's a habit that he picked up over the years guarding both Presidents Carter and Regan in him being able to blend in with the furniture or background in him remaining inconspicuous, to any attempted assassins, on he job. Taking on an assignment at the insistence of his good friend Mr. Dewaney, Bill Cobbs, to be Miss Marron's personal bodyguard the company that he surrounds herself with get so intrusive in him doing his job that he almost quits before he begins. It's Rachel's sweet looks and bubbling personality that keeps him on the job guarding her and also the fact that those in her entourage of flunkies and hanger on being so completely incompetent in doing their jobs that makes him stay.We and Farmer know right away that someone out there is trying to do Rachel in but that fact is kept from her by those around her that makes Farmer's job that much more difficult. Acting as if she doesn't have a care or fear in the world Rachel doesn't realize that her life and body, the body that Farmer is guarding with his life, is in serious danger. It's only much later when Rachel gets a disturbing pone call, on her private phone number, that she finally gives in and lets Farmer do his job protecting her life. It's her obsessed fan and stalker who's planning to whack her at the biggest moment in Rachel's life when she's to accept the Academy Award for best actress with over a billion people watching the great event live and on TV all over the globe.***SPOILERS*** The love angle in the movie doesn't quite pan out with Farmer and Marron never really clicking in their love scenes that come across mechanical and not genuine at all. Farmer for one is so intense in all of his scenes that showing affection towards Rachel seems out of character for him in the movie. It's only in the last few moments that Farmer gets his act together in realizing who's out to knock off Rachel that he really seems to care for Rachel and tries to save her life even at the expense of his own. But by then she's so turned off by his almost zombie or robot like action that she almost allows her intended killer to do her in by not believing or responding to Farmers frantic attempts to save her life.Both Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston as Frank Farmer & Rachel Marro did their best to make their parts in the movie work and the final payoff with a by then a disgraced, in letting things get out of hand, Farmer saving Rachel's life which saved the film from being total disaster. It was sad that the film 'The Bodyguard' in a way predicted its star Whitney Houston's actual death some 20 years later in 2012. It was then just like in the movie Whitney faced death this time in her hotel bathtub, not from an assassin's bullet, just before she was to receive a Grammy for her music like an Academy Award for her acting in 'The Bodygurad'. But this time in real life not in the movies the outcome was sadly a lot different.",6,1,4,14 July 2013

The Caine Mutiny," If you want to do something about it I'll be outside. I'm a lot drunker then you are so it ill be a fair fight!
","***SPOILERS*** It's when the USS Cain's skipper Cmdr. DeViress, Tom Tully, was suddenly replaced by hard bitten and by the books Lt. Cmdr. Philip Francis Queeg, Humphrey Bogart, that things started to drastically change for it's more or less motley and disheveled crew. Queeg took absolutely no BS from the sailors and made them shape up or had them ship out if they didn't follow his orders to the letter. This seems to bother his communications officer Lt. Keefer Fred MacMurray, who in studying the human condition,in being a part time mystery writer, felt that Queeg was a bit off center in his mental stability.It was after a while when Queeg started showing signs of being off his rocker in how he not only treated his men but the ship USS Cain as well that Keefer came to the conclusion that he's unfit to run the ship. It's then that Keefer tried to convince Queeg's 1st. Mate Lt.Steve Maryk,Van Johnson, to relive him of command before his bizarre actions end up sinking the ship together with its crew. The straw that finally broke the camel's back was the strawberry incident where Queeg became obsessed in finding out who broke into the ship's ice box and ate a number of portions of the frozen fruit without authorization!This almost had Keefer together with 1st Mate Maryk and Ens. Willie Keith, Robert Francis, go so far as to report Queeg's actions to his commanding officer with Keefer then chickening out at the very last moment and aborting the entire idea. The dam finally broke during a violent Pacific typhoon when Queeg was about to let the USS. Cain go under the waves, by freezing in the sight of danger, that a reluctant 1st. Mate Haryk took command of the ship against Queeg's strong objections. This all set up the navel court marshal trail of both 1st.

Broken and humiliated by this experience Queeg broke down mumbling to himself about how everyone on the ship was conspiring against him! With the now discredited Queeg exposed for what he is, mentally unstable, the the only verdict that the jury could came up with in the charges against Maryk and Keith was a unanimous not guilty!

The Thing," Were not getting out of here alive, and neither is that 'Thing'
","***SPOILERS*** As the film 'The Thing' opens we see this sled dog trudging through the vast Antarctic wasteland of ice and snow being chased by a helicopter. Opening fire on the dog the Norwegian pilot, Larry J. Franco, seems to be terribly agitated at the dog escaping his rifle fire and then opens up a grenade canister and throws it at the fleeing canine. After what seems like forever the dog reaches the US scientific outpost #31 and as the men stationed there run out to see what's happening the pilot starts shooting and throwing grenades all over the place like a man gone insane. He's then shot and killed by Garry, Donald Moffat, after the crazed pilot earlier ended up accidentally blowing up his helicopter with a loose grenades. Finding a partly burned map of the outpost that the dead pilot came from Dr. Copper, Richard A. Dysart, together with US Army helicopter pilot MacReady, Kurt Russell, fly out to the place only to find it burnt-out with everyone there frozen or burned to death. By MacReady and Dr, Copper taking back one of the dead bodies to be examined they brought,together with the runaway dog that was already taken into in the US encampment,into play one of the most hideous monsters that was ever put into a motion picture. A monster that laid dormant for tens of thousands of years until the Norwegian Antarctic expedition dug it out of the ice and inadvertently released it. A horror that within three years could very will wipe out the entire human race by first replicating and then destroying it. Unlike the original 1951 movie 'The Thing from another World' the John Carpanter directed films storyline follows very closely the famous 1938 Sci-Fi short story 'Who Goes There' by John W. Campball that both films were based on. Surviving through the process of replicating itself in it's host body 'The Thing', after wiping out the Norwegian outpost, turned itself into a sled dog and then ended up getting into the US base #31. At the base 'The Thing' started to take over the bodies of first the sled dog and then the men stationed there by initially infecting them in order to enter their system. Then, like an unending row of domino's, 'The Thing' goes from one person to another until 'It' destroyed every living thing, human animal and plant, on earth. Looking something like a cross between a giant spider and octopus 'The Thing', when it was in it's natural state, looked like a nightmare that came straight out of hell. But when it infected and took over someone on the base, and hid itself inside the persons body, it acted perfectly normal and human until the opportunity presented itself for 'It' to strike again. It was only too late that the US military men and scientists at the base-camp began to realize that once 'The Thing' got into their camp the only way that it could be stopped was for them to destroy everything living that it came in contact with, the entire base-camp with them along with it. Not making the same mistake that the Norwegians did by unknowingly allowing it enter their encampment and then later escape, after wiping them out, and continue it's murderous rampage on earth. With the fires that were started by him and his men, battling 'The Thing', slowly burning themselves out MacReady and Childs,Keith David, the last two survivors of this inferno wait for the bitter minus 100 degree Antarctic winter to set in and thus put them out of there miseries. Shearing a bottle of R&B whiskey to numb their senses they both sit and wait for the end to come knowing that with their actions they put an end to 'The Thing' and it's ability to use them to farther it's demonic goal in destroying all of mankind.",8,5,10,4 July 2005

That has Roger come to her rescue only to end up holding on to dear life, with Eva, on the slops of Mt. Rushmore.Exciting final on Mt. Rushmore that, together with the dramatic and heart-stopping crop-duster plane chase scene, has since become Hollywood folk legend. Cary Grant is the perennially innocent bystander who gets in way over his head but somehow is able to overcome every obstacle, big or small, thrown at him. Ending up with the girl and the top secret micro-film slated for then Soviet Union. 'North by Northwest' is a non-stop action-packed thriller that never lets up, even when there's no action going on, for a moment and to think that Roger Thronhill who was in the middle of all this excitement was divorced twice on the grounds that his two former wives stated that he was just too dull and boring of a man to live with!",8,0,1,27 August 2006
Salt," Make sure that they bring body bags we've got at least seven
","***SPOILERS*** Very exciting but factually ridiculous film about this plot to destroy the USA by a group of Soviets sleeper agents on what they've designated to be called X Day: The Day of Judgement! The trouble with all that is that their totally unaware that the Soviet Government that engineered this half baked plan back in he 1970's at the height of the Cold War has been out of circulation or business for almost 20 years.The top honcho or assassin in this entire scheme turns out to be sleeper CIA agent Evelyn Salt, Angelina Jolie, who's in fact outed by Russian defector Vasily Oriov, Daniel Olbrychski, who claims he dying of cancer and has nothing to lose. As it turned out Salt is to be part of an assassin plan to knock off the Russian President Boris Matveyev, Olek Krupa, who's to attend Vice President Otis' funeral in New York City. It's then that the action really starts popping with Salt having her clover blown now on the run throughout the entire movie for reasons,besides being outed, known only to herself. It seems that Salt has somehow changed her opinion for those she's working for and become a good guy or good gal and joined forces with the good old,where she spent almost her entire life, USA.It takes a while to realize what's going on in the film with Salt preforming all kinds of superhuman feats like jumping 200 feet with a wet t-shirt from a helicopter, after being shot, into the freezing Potomac River that would make spies and martial art artists like James Bond and Bruce Lee look like stark armatures in comparison. Salt is first involved in the assassination of President Matveyev and then for no reason whats so ever turns on her Soviet sleeper comrades, whom she put to sleep permanently, ending up knocking off the entire crew. Including Vasily Oriov who in fact turned out to be her father! There's also the very pressing problem facing Salt in that theirs a mole in the CIA who's using her to do all his dirty work! He's then planning to ice Salt and become a hero in saving the USA and the world, that this sleeper unit he's part of was planning, from nuclear destruction.Algelina Jolie is very convincing as the indestructible Evelyn Salt who's out to save the world with the world,or US Government,out to stop her in thinking that she's in fact really trying to destroy it. Salt's boss in the CIA Ted Winter, Liev Schreiber, doesn't quite know what to make of her in feeling that Salt is somehow a double agent and playing a deadly game of cat and mouse with both countries that she's working for. The same goes for head of White House security Mr. Peabody, Chiwetel Ejlofor, who despite all the damage Salt caused him, killing dozens of his men, feels that she's really on the right side, the USA, of the issues. ***SPOILERS*** There's also Salt's husband Michael Krause, August Diehl, who's expertise in spider venom comes in very handy for Salt later on in the film in being able to bring back the dead in the case of Russian President Boris Matveyev. An event that not only blows the entire plan of setting off a Third World War, by Oriov & Co, but ended up costing Michael his life.",6,2,3,9 January 2012
The Battle of Algiers," Algeria 1954-62: A history lesson on film
","******SPOILERS****** The place is Algiers, the time is August 26, 1957 and the person involved is Ali La Pointe an FLN, National Liberation Front, leader trapped in a building with his men and given an ultimatum to surrender by the French military or end up being killed.The movie then goes back some three years to All Saint's Day November 1, 1954 the start to the Algerian Revolt. Ali at that time 24 years old with a long criminal record is arrested and jailed for assault and while in prison he gets influenced by one of the inmates who's executed for being part of the revolt against the French occupying government. When he's released Ali joins the FLN and makes his way up in that organization from a spy to a soldier and then to a major leader of rebels attacking French troops and police in the Casbah section of the city of Algiers. The revolt grow from taking pot shots on the French police and military to all out attacks on dance halls restaurants bus and train depots where hundreds of French as well as Algerian civilian are killed and wounded. Also the scale of attacks on the French police and soldiers reach such a point that law and order becomes almost no-existent in Algiers as well as all of Algeria by 1957. The French government in desperation sends in it's most seasoned troops into the country to quell the revolt led by paratroop commander Col. Mathieu, Jean Martin, a WWII as well as a Indochina war hero. The French under Mathieu go about to put down the rebel revolt almost if not even more ruthlessly as the the FLN rebels which only turns more Algerians, who were neutral, against the French. Col. Mathieu's plan is to kill or capture all the top rebel leaders and with that accomplished he feels that the revolt would be extinguished and Ali La Pointe is one of those leaders that Col. Mathieu is looking to put out of commission. The torture of a FLN rebel pays off when he breaks down and leads to French troops under Col. Mathieu to the place where Ali is hiding and thats where we get back to the beginning of the movie. Refusing to surrender Ali and his men are blown to pieces when the French army dynamites the building that they are hold up in and with that Ali La Pointe's contribution to the Algerian revolt is over but not for those still fighting against the French.The movie goes into the early 1960's where the revolt got to the point where the French government, in a last and desperate effort to end the bloodshed, held an open election for Algerian independence in 1962 With the vote was 91% in favor of independence on July 5, 1962, the 132nd anniversary of the French entrance into Algeria, Algeria was proclaimed a free and independent nation and thus the bloody Algerian revolt ended. Great docudrama of one of the most defining event of the post WWII world without a single inch of actual news footage. The Algerian revolt lasted eight years and cost the French some 18,000 soldiers and 3,000 civilians The loss of life among the Algerian people was astronomical being estimated a around and even over one million dead. The Algerian revolt even spilled over into France proper itself and cost some 4,000 casualties in that country in terrorist and counter-terrorist attacks.'The Battle of Algiers' is one of the best historical films, even though it has no news footage in it at all, ever made and is being re-issued this year, 2004, on VHS and DVD. With what's been happening in the news it's re-release couldn't be more timely,don't miss it. It will be an historical as well as emotional experience to everyone that sees it.",9,1,3,13 January 2004
Disturbia," Beach Blanket Bingo meets Henry the Serial Killer
","****SPOILERS**** Funny in an unusual sort of way 'Disturbia' despite it's last fifteen bloodcurdling minutes doesn't really have anyone in it's cast killed on screen. Yes the serial killer in the film had racked up over a score of victims all across the country but for some strange reason try as he could he couldn't as much as even draw blood much less kill, with the exception of an unfortunate policeman, the persons that he's really after in the film.The only person killed, besides the cop as his killer, on screen in the movie is its star young Kale's, Shia LaBeouf, dad Mr. Brecht, Matt Craven, in a spectacular car crash early in the film. Kale is very sensitive as well as guilty, he was in the car with his dad when the accident happened, over his fathers death. It's a year later that Kale gets a bit disturbed when his Spanish teacher Senor Gutierrez, Rene Rivera, told the disruptive student what his father would think of his actions if her were alive today. Kale not having an answer to Gutierrez's question lands a stiff right to his head, giving Gutierrez a king size shiner, and ends up with three months house arrest.The movie goes on with Kale stuck at home, with an electronic ankle brace, and having nothing to do but spy on his neighbors with his binoculars and state-of-the-art electronic spying equipment. Doing the usual crazy antics that you would expect from a teenager, without a cause, like Kale he gets his fellow Spanish class student Korean/American Ronnie, Aaron Yoo, to help him out. Ronnie goes outside the 100 foot perimeter, set by the court for Kale, checking things, with a video/DVD camera, out for him in what's going on, with the cute and sexy chicks, in the neighborhoodEverything is just groovy for Kale and Ronnie who later get to become friendly with Kale's new next door neighbor Ashley, Sarah Roemer. It's Ashley who the two horny teenagers had been spying on for days as she undressed in her bedroom, with the sades up, and went for daily dips, wearing an microscopic bikini, in her parents swimming pool. It's when Kale notices his other new next door neighbor Mr. Turnner, David Morse, acting a bit funny with the fact that a local young woman was just kidnapped the day before that he decides to play detective.***SPOILER ALERT***Throwing away all the good times he was having in spying on his neighbors, mostly scantly clad and shapely teenage girls, up until then Kale begins to stalk, together with Ronnie and Ashley, poor Mr. Turner day and night making his up until them serene and quite life a living hell. Kale is out to see if Mr.Turner is in fact someone you wouldn't want to leave alone with the kids wife or even family pet. Mr. Turner, wanting very much to be a good neighbor, for his part tries to be as friendly as he can be with the suspicious Kale and friends. The mild mannered and soft-spoken Mr. Turner goes so far as helping Kale's mom Mrs. Julie Brecht, Carrie-Ann Moss, with her groceries and even fixes her cars flat tire.Almost getting himself arrested by the police for breaking into Mr. Turners house Kale, whom the kind and understanding Mr. Turner refused to press charges against, is warned by the police and his guidance counselor that the next time he screws up they'll put him away in the lock-up, with hardened criminals, for a year. Still refusing to give up on his almost around the clock persecution of the very, who's nerves by now has reached their breaking point, kind and understanding Mr. Turner Kale gets exactly what he wants but not how he thought he would get it; A face to face confrontation with a psycho serial murderer. Kale by crying wolf for so long in accusing the lovable and Teddy Bear-like Mr. Turner of being a serial killer has no one believe, as if they did before, him now when a real live and blood-thirsty serial killer came on the scene.You never get the feeling that 'Disturbia' is what it tries so hard to be in its scaring the hell out of you. Everything about it, in trying to be a horror film, is so out of focus that it comes across as a Three Stooges comedy short with almost nobody, despite all the suffering their put through, really getting hurt. The teenagers, Kale & friend, act like those playful and party going youths and teenagers in 1960's Frankie Avalon & Annette Funicello beach party movies. They don't for a moment give you the impression that their being stalked and attacked, with the intent of being murdered, by a serial psycho killer at all! P.S In fact Kale's ordeal in being involved with a serial psycho killer, whom in the end he does in, doesn't at all impressed the police or even his schools probation officer! He still, after all his heroic efforts in the film, has to serve out his three months house arrest despite of all he did in preventing further murders in and around town!",6,0,2,18 March 2008
The Patriot," Majestic motion picture about the American Revolutionary War
","'The Patriot' is without a doubt the best movie about the American Revolutionary War that was ever made. The movie is somehow the Revolutionary War's version of 'All Quiet on the Western Front' but only in reverse. Where in 'All Quiet on the Western Front' is a story about a young German student Paul Baumer who gets caught up with the pro-war enthusiasm of August 1914 and eagerly joins the Kaiser's army only to lose his love for war after seeing up front the horrors and bloodshed that war spawned. Where as in 'The Patriot' the story is just the opposite.In the movie we have a man Benjamin Martin, Mel Gibson,who fought with honor and bravery in the French and Indian War of 1754-60. Martin was so repelled by the war that he never wanted to have anything to do with war again. It wasn't until his home was burned down and his young son Thomas, Gregory Smith, was murdered by the British and his older son Gabriel, Heath Ledger, taken away by them to be hanged that Benjamin Martin changed his mind. Turning into a tiger and fighting like hell against the Red Coats with a fury that was impressive enough to inspire those of his fellow Colonialists to fight along with him.'The Patriot' is both grand in scope and deep and rich in the history that it presents. It's everything that a movie about an historic event like the American Revolutionary War should be. Well written and acted with beautiful and breath-taking photography and with an eye on the details of the era 1775-1781 that makes you feel as if you were there. You can see just what a good actor Mel Gibson is in his first battle scene when he attacks a British unit with his two young sons who have his older son Gabriel being taken away to be executed. In a matter of minutes he changes from a peaceful and law biding person into a savage and blood-thirsty killer that's so convincing that it almost makes you for just that moment feel sorry for the British soldiers. Who are about to kill his oldest son and murdered by shooting in the back his younger son Thomas just moments before.There's a number of equally effective scenes in the movie ending in one of the most action packed and realistic battle sequences ever filmed in any war movie in motion picture history. With the movie ending at Yorktown Va. with the British Army of Gen. Cornwallis trapped between the Continental Army on land and the French Fleet blocking their escape to the sea on October 19, 1781 that ended the Revolutionary War in the American Colonialists favor. 'The Patriot' is always being compared to Mel Gibson's previous historical movie classic 'Braveheart' and alway seems to come out second best. I feel that 'The Patriot' is every bit as good as 'Braveheart' if not even a better movie. It's 'The Patriot's' misfortune to have been made some five years after 'Braveheart' so it comes across like it's not an entirely different movie then 'Braveheart' but it's sequel",10,8,18,1 March 2004
Behind The Candelabra," Son of Liberace
","The film 'Behind the Candelabra' covers the last ten years in the life of the great piano playing Valentino Liberace, Michael Douglas, or known as just plain Lee to his friends who at the time was pushing 60 and looking for some new companionship in his life. Liberace found it with 18 year old veterinarian assailant Scott Thorson played by an almost unrecognizable with his hair bleached blond and puffed up cheeks, 'like Marlon Brando in The Godfather', Matt Damon. It was in fact Scott curing Liberace's pet dog 'Baby Boy' that really turned him on to Scott who was flattered by the, what he was known at the time and all throughout his adult life, Worlds Greatest Entertainer's personal attention.Rplacing Lee's two top houseboys Billy Leatherwood and Carlucci, Cheyenne Jackson & Bruce Ramsey, Scott now became his bosses Liberace or Leiber-Archie as his step mom Rose Carracappa, Jane Morris, called him main man in the Liberace household. Things were going great for a while for both Scott and Lee until Liberace like some crazed 1930's and 1940's movie mad scientist decide to make Scott, through cosmetic surgery, into his own image. Liberace hires quack doctor Jack Stantz, Rob Lowe, to work on the very reluctant Scott who was very satisfied with his already God-given good looks to make him look more like himself. The crazy Doc Stantz in fact got Scott addicted on drugs, legal & illegal, that tuned him almost overnight into a street corner drug addict.Liberace who refused to take responsibility in what he turned his #1 houseboy Scott Thorson into soon got tied of him and the hot and heavy, in and out of bed, relationship between the two started to cool of. After a five year live-in relationship Scott now on the brink of becoming homeless sued his former boss and lover Liberace for 113 million dollars, just a drop in the bucket in Liberace far flung assets, in a ground breaking palimony suite. As things sadly turned out for Scott he ended up getting a meager $95,000.00 together with two beat up cars and two of Liberace's pet dogs in an out of court settlement instead.It's later when Liberace came down with the deadly AIDS virus that the two former lovers got together for the last time and kissed and made up with Scott promising the dying Liberace that he'll keep his some five year relationship with him secret and out of the public eye. From what I got from all this is that either Liberace was too ill or Scott too hooked on drugs to realize that if the two came to some financial understanding, like having taken care of Scott's money needs, that book written about Liberace's secret lifestyle 'Behind the Candelabra' by an almost destitute money strapped and drug addicted Scott Thorton, which the film is based on, would have never been written in the first place!P.S Liberace's fame never wavered even for a moment with his both old and new fans alike. Even in the last year of his life in Liberace having sold out to standing room only every show, some 50 of them, that he did in the fall of 1986 just months before his death. As for his using a candelabra as a prop on his piano that became synonymous with the great Liberace he got that idea from watching the 1945 movie, when he was at the time a completely unknown, 'A Song to Remember' with Paul Muni Merle Oberon & Cornel Wilde. In fact it was Liberace not the movie that inspired him to put it into his act that made the Candelabra famous!",Null,2,5,1 June 2013
School of Rock," Music is the window to the soul
","Down on his luck and smashed on booze rock guitarist Dewey Finn, Jack Black, is behind on his rent in the apartment that he shares with his friend and former rock musician and now substitute teacher Ned Schneebly, Mike White, and his, Ned's, girlfriend Patty Di Marco, Sarah Silverman. At the studio where his rock band is rehearsing for the big nation-wide 'Battle of the Bands' competition Dewey is told that he's been voted off the band and replaced, in short he's been canned. With the whole world collapsing around him Dewey gets a phone call at home that changes his, and those who he later comes in contact with, world forever. Wanting to talk to his room-mate Ned who's away Horace Green Elementary School Principle Rosalie Mullins, Joan Cusack,tells Dewy that one of the teacher at the school just got hurt and that Ned was highly recommended to teach in this very prestigious prep elementary school. Dewey pretending to be Ned says he'll be over to teach as soon as possible feeling that he'll make the money he needs for the rent working there and no one will know the difference if he's a teacher or not. Dewey as well as the students that he was to teach at first didn't know it but that he as well as they were in for the surprise of their lives. Rip roaring movie much like the old Judy Garland Mickey Rooney musicals of the 1940's about a group of kids who never really had any good and constructive fun in their lives due to their strict upbringing by their stuffed up parents and teachers letting their hair down and their singing voices and musical instruments up. In the end the students making it to the 'battle of the Band' competition contest and at the same time feeling a lot better about themselves and those around them by doing that; all because of that nobody who was really somebody, but at the time didn't know it, Dewey Finn. Jack Black gives a solid as well as touching performance as Dewey Finn the washed up musician who through teaching music gave him a new lease on life as well as the young students that he was teaching. What worked so well in the movie was that the music that the students were playing was a composition of all their efforts put together to make it into a beautiful harmony. Where everyone pitches in together like a well synchronized symphony orchestra to make it all work. Also very moving in the movie 'School of Rock' was the Horace Green Elementary School's Principle Rosalie Mullins played by Joan Cusack. Tight and stuck up and with no sense of humor we see her after having a mug of beer with Dewey at a local bar open up and tell him the pressures that she's under from the school staff and the students parents. As it just burns her to keep all that tension in and not allowing any of her real feelings to come out. In the end the music that Dewey and his students practiced and later played at the 'Battle of the Bands' competition not only let her come out of her shell but the students parents as well. Dewys music brought the best out of their kids by teaching them to be together as a team in success as well as in failure instead of trying to one up each other at the expense of those who didn't make it.Like the saying by the great American Writer/Composer Aaron Copland says about music: That after silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music.",9,4,7,5 December 2004
The Adjustment Bureau," I guess I'll have to change my plan
","***SPOILERS*** The movie 'The Adjustment Bureau' updates our version of guardian angles in that they guides us through life by supernatural not spiritual means. In the film David Norris, Matt Damon, who's a shoo-in in being elected the next senator of the Epmire State, New York, gets crashed on election day when a photo of himself taken when he was in collage has David mooning the audience after an all night booze and beer drinking party.Alone in the mens-room at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel trying to get up enough courage to face his very disappointed supporters and the TV crews with his concession speech David finds Elsie Sellers, Emily Blunt, hiding in one of the stalls in an effort to meet and talk to him! Surprised at what's happening to him, finding a girl in the mens-room, David is so impressed with Elise in what she tells him about being himself instead of the phony baloney that his political handlers made him out to be that he gives the speech of his now almost dead political career by being honest for the first time in his now defunct campaign for senator of New York State!A few days later when David ran into Elsie on a NYC transit bus he mistakenly spilled hot coffee on her dress and offered to pay the laundry bill for it in order to get her both address and phone number. The trouble with all that is that the coffee spill happened 15 minutes after it was supposed to happen,at David's apartment, thus screwing up what fate, or the 'Adjustment Bureau', had in store for him! And that was to change not only David's but Elise's life as well and put the 'Adjustment Bureau' headed by head man Thomas, Terrance Stamp,into overdrive to correct it!Based on a 1954 short story by science fiction writer Philip Dick 'The Adjustment Bureau' delivers the goods to its audience in how the phrase 'Love Conquers all' is as meaningfully now in an age of selfish greed and loose morals as it was some 60 years when it was first published. David was salted to not only to become a state senator but the President of the United States if he just played his cards right in going along with what the men of the 'Adjustment Bureau' had planned for him. Instead he was more then willing to throw it all away for the women he loved-Elsie-even though she thought that he was some kind of a nut and really didn't want anything to do with him!***SPOILERS**** It took a while for David to get Elsie to see things his way which couldn't happen at a more depressing time for him on Elsie's upcoming wedding day at the New York Municipal Courthouse in downtown Manhattan! With the help of 'Adjustment Bureau' hat-man, the hat is where the power is, Harry Mitchell, Anthony Mackie, David was able to convince Elsie that he wasn't at all nuts but dead on target with the fantastic stories he was telling her about these strange men in black like individuals who were trying to keep both him and her apart. The end couldn't come soon enough when both David and Elise were about to be lobotomized by Thomas and his fellow adjusters that the 'Big Man' or the 'Chairman', can you just guess who he is, came to their rescue in changing their futures, and lifetime book reviews, in order to keep them together not, like Thomas planned all along, apart! In the end David who was more then willing to throw away a promising political career for Elise ended up having both because he let his heart not battered and confused brain, that Thomas & Co were manipulating, do the thinking for him!",8,1,2,1 July 2011
The Graduate," You are scum! You are filth! Your a degenerate!
","***SPOILERS*** Even though it ended up becoming one of the biggest movie hits of all times 'The Graduate' had trouble getting any of the major Hollywood studios to distribute it! With them feeling that it's story was either too spicy or it's cast with with exception of Anne Bancroft, as Mrs. Robinson, too unknown to make the film profitable. As it turned out the 3 million dollars it took to make the movie ended up cashing in some 200 million, in the USA and aboard, for the almost unknown Embessy Pictures who took the chance in distributing it.After graduating with honors, as the debating team captain and top track and field star, from collage Ben Braddock, Dustin Hoffman,had the world at his feet with a bright future ahead of him. What turned out to be Ben's insecurity in his shyness in making friends with the opposite sex that soon ended up turning into a nightmare for him. Long time family friend Mrs. Robinson seeing the young man at a coming home reception set her sights on him in both deflowering Ben and making him her both secret lover and personal sex toy.Tricking Ben to drive her home Mrs. Robinson gets the confused and shy collage boy all alone! She then starts to both flirt and disrobe, doing a very sexy and provocative strip tease right in front of the shocked and startled young man. At first resisting Mrs. Robinson's advances Ben soon gives into them having a wild and illicit affair with her. It's when Mrs. Robinson's 20 year old daughter Elaine, Katherine Ross, came home from collage on the East Coast that this cozy relationship between Ben and Mrs. Robinson starts to fall apart. In that even though Mrs. Robinson felt nothing wrong with her, a married woman, having an affair with Ben she at the same time was outraged that he would end up very possibly doing the very same thing with her both single and available daughter Elaine!Even though at first Ben is anything but interested in Elaine the fact that he was matched up with her by both his parents and the unsuspecting Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilion), who was unaware that Ben was having an affair with his wife, Mrs. Robinson turned both vicious and vindictive towards the by now emotionally destroyed Ben Braddock!As much as he tires to avoid it Ben falls in love with Elaine but when Mrs. Robinson threatens to expose his relationship with her Ben, what I think stupidly, beats her to the punch! It's with Ben confessing that he once was 'making it' with her mom that Elaine, who at first was in love with him, throws him out of her, the Robinson residence, house and cuts Ben out of her life forever!Even tough it was the best part of the movie Ben's attempt to win Elaine back never seemed to ring true. Instead of the sensitive and feeling person that he was at the beginning of the film Ben turned out to be a down right and, for the most part, unfeeling jerk in the end. Hounding Elaine all throughout the city of San Francisco, that he traveled to from his home in L.A, where she was enrolled in Berkley Collage a hot bed for student activation Ben both insulated and humiliated Elaine at every opportunity. It was when Ben found out that Elaine had a boyfriend medical student Carl Smith, Brian Avery, that he really went to work on her. Ben soon gets under Elaine's skin by him gleefully taunting her in public, in the Berkley Collage Library, about when she first made it with Carl. This has Elaine leaving the sneering and nosy jerk in a rush and in tears! It made you wonder why Elaine would have anything to do with Ben again but amazingly she did!***SPOILER ALERT*** Despite the films many shortcomings in it trying to make Ben Braddock a hero or just plain nice guy the outrageous actions of Ms. Robinson more then made you forget as well as overlook Ben's hurtful actions, towards Elaine, in it. The by now legendary and unforgettable ending at Elaine and Carl's wedding ceremony has Ben snatch Elaine just moments after she and Carl took their wedding vows. You wonder why Elaine was so happy to at first become Carl's wife and then, on a dime, decide to leave him for an almost insane and hysterically acting Ben! As unsound and unrealistic as both Ben and Elaine's actions at the very end of the movie were they still made a hell of a happy ending!",8,1,2,9 October 2008
Enemy at the Gates," If we lose the city the entire nation will collapse
","(There are some Spoilers) True story of a Russian shepherd boy who's biggest ambition in life was to become a foreman, in a Soviet industrial factory, instead ending up becoming a Hero of the Soviet Union by picking off almost 150 German troops with his trusty snipers rifle in the battle scared factory district during the battle of Stalingrad.With the German advance steamrolling into the USSR in the spring and summer of 1942 by early September the only obstacle that stood in the way of a Nazi victory in Russia, and eventually winning the Second World War altogether, was the highly industrial city on the River Volga ironically named after the then dictator, Joseph Stalin, of the Soviet Union Stalingrad.The German superiority in armor and air-power was counterbalanced not only by the Red Army's brutal tactics against their own troops killing many Russian soldiers, by rearguard NKVD execution squads, who tried to surrender to the German forces or retreat from the front-lines. Also the street fighting skills of Gen. Chikov's 62nd Army that did the brunt of the fighting and dying in the defense of the city.Early in the fighting young Red Army private Vassili Zaitsev, Jude Law, trapped in no-mans land picked off five German soldiers in ten minutes to the admiration of his fellow, and disabled, Red Army comrade Danilov, Joseph Flennes. Danilov get's this idea of lifting the Red Army's sagging moral in the fighting by making Vassili a national hero in publishing his sniping exploits in the Red Army's newspaper. Keeping a daily score of his kills on the front page.The Soviet political commissar of Stalingrad Nikita Krushchev, Bob Hoskins, is more then delighted with both Danilov idea and Vassili's exploits promoting both of them. Danilov to a commissar post and Vassili to the head of an elite Soviet sniper company. As Vassili's daily kills raise the Red Army's hopes and moral in Stalingrad the German's get their ace sniper Major Konig, Ed Harris, to get into a killing contest with Vassili. With the eventual winner being the one who knocks off the opposing champion, Vassili or Konig, first. The great battle scenes in the movie are offset by a fictitious and schmaltzy love triangle between the two friends Vassili and Danilov with pretty Jewish Red Army woman soldier Tani Chernova, Rachel Weisz. There's also a underlying racial element in this tri-love affair with Danilov who's himself Jewish resenting that his good friend and army comrade Vassili, who saved his life, having an affair with a Jewish woman.Konig getting to Stalingrad for the big showdown starts to pick off Red Army soldiers with the same ease and skill as Vassili does against the Germans. It's only a matter of time before the two square off against each other but the fact that now Tani is the mix things get a lot more complicated. Danilov want's to have Tani transfered away from the front not only to keep her from getting killed but away from her lover Vassili. This underhanded action on Danilov's part leads the former Ural shepherd boy to lose his concentration and almost get picked off by the far less worried, about his love life, Major Konig.There's also little 8 year old Sacha Filipov, Gabriel Thomson, who's spying for the Red Army in order to get important information on Major Konigs whereabouts so that his hero Vassili can get the drop on him. Major Konig who pays off little Sacha with bars of chocolates and hunks of bacon, what a weird combination, for his services knows what he's really up to, a double-agent for the Russians. Major Konig gives Sacha a chance to escape but thinking that the German Major is being fooled by his charade Sacha tragically ends up being captured and hanged by a very reluctant but iron-Prussian willed Konig.With the city looking like it's on the verge of falling to the Germans the remaining population is evacuated across the Volga which includes Sacha's mother, and Tina good friend, Mrs. Filipou ,Eva Matters. Mrs. Filipou is told by Danilov that her son deserted to the other side to keep her from knowing the truth that he was executed by the Nazis. During the evacuation Tina gets hit by a German artillery shell and, being so badly wounded, is then thought to have been killed. This leads Danilov ,in a last gesture of friendship, towards Vassili,to exposed himself getting hit right between the eyes by Konig which leads him to come out in the open and into the gun-sight of Vassili Zaitsev's snipers rifle. it's later revealed that Tina survived her wounds making Danilov act of self-sacrifice even more telling that it already was.P.S Vassili Zaitsev's career as a Red Army sniper came to a sudden end in early 1943 when he was badly injured by a German land mine. Vassili lost what's the most important attribute that a sniper needs to do his deadly work his sight. Being awarded Hero of the Soviet Union by Comrade Stalin Vassili is looked upon today some 60 years after WWII as one of the greatest fighting men in Russian, Soviet or otherwise, history. Vassili's snipers rifle is on display in the Stalingrad War Museum in Volgagrad named after the river that it's on not the WWII Soviet dictator who was responsible, in safe and far off Moscow, for it's heroic defense.",7,0,1,1 September 2006
Jaws," It wasn't a propeller.. It wasn't a coral reef.. And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.. It was a Shark!
","***SPOILERS*** It's when teenager Cassie, Susan Blacklinie, went skinny dipping one evening in the waters off Long Island Sound that she attracted this giant 25 foot great white shark who ended up taking her out and under for his dinner! With the July 4th festivities about to start the seaside town of Amity, who's economy depends on tourist summer dollars, the news that a killer and man eating shark is on the loose off it's waters is the last thing that the town fathers and its Mayor Vaughn, Murray Hamilton, want the public to know about! It's when against his better judgment due to the pressure put on him by Mayor Vaughn Amity Police Chief Brody,Roy Scheider, kept the beaches opened that the killer shark strikes again gulping down another victim in front of hundreds of terrified beach goers including Chief Brody. With panic engulfing Amity and after a false report of having harpooned and killed the shark he strikes again this time in shallow waters off Amity Island. This on July 4th taking down another victim and thus closing the beaches indefinitely until the shark, the real killer shark not a cheap imitation,is finally put out of commission!With Mayor Vaughn and the town fathers finally coming to their senses their forced to hire the famed shark hunter Captain Quint, Robert Shaw, at $10,000.00 plus expenses to track down and kill the man eating shark before he adds more victims to his already impressive body count. There's also the young wise cracking Oceanographer Hooper, Richard Dreyfuss, who goes along for the ride together with chief Brody on Quint's shark hunting boat the Orca. It's Hooper's know it all attitude about marine life and sea fearing that starts to get under Quint's skin and almost leads the two to go at each other instead of at the killer shark. It's only later on that Hooper gains a new found respect for Quint when he finds out that his obsession with sharks and wanting to kill them was the result of an incident back in WWII where he almost ended up together with most of his 700 fellow US Navy sailors, on the torpedoed USS Indianapolis, being eaten by one of them.With the three, Quint Brody & Hooper, shark hunters out at sea is when the killer shark, efficiently called Bruce, comes out in the open with his razor sharp and serrated teeth, as much as three rows of them,flashing. From then on it's a battle between man and beast on the open seas with the killer shark making the best of the situation. It's his turf or waters that he's battling in and he knows every drop of it. That's until Brody now on his own with nothing to lose, but his life, overcomes his fear of the high seas and together with a high powered rifle and full oxygen tank finally turns the tables on the surging like a train locomotive Bruce the Shark. With Brody leaving about just enough of him,all 25 feet and three ton's worth, to fully pack an 8 to 12 once sardine can! P.S 'Jaws' released in the early summer of 1975 became the biggest money making hit in motion picture history in only just six weeks after it's initial release! Surpressing and almost doubling the profits of the previous money earing champ 'The Godfather' without as much as breaking a sweat in doing it. Not at first thought to become the mega monster hit, with all the troubles and delays in filming it, that it turned out to be 'Jaws' astounded the movie critics as well as it's own cast & crew members who before it's release had them feeling that it was going to be the 'Bomb' of the century, and end up destroying their careers, who tried to distance and disown themselves from the film. Check out the author of the novel 'Jaws' that the film was based on Peter Benchley as a TV reporter on the Amity beach just before the killer shark springs or swims into action.",7,3,5,20 May 2012
Shooter," What did you feel the first time you shot someone? The recoil of the rifle!
","***SPOILER ALERT*** Straight out of both today's and yesterday's headline 'Shooter' is without a doubt the best and most explosive political action film since Oliver Stone's 'JFK' that was released back in 1991. The film centers around an uncovered plot to assassinate the President of the United States played by Tom Butler. This has the FBI CIA and Secret Services trying to find out how it would be done with the sniper, who's to do the hit, planning to accomplish the task from a distance of as much as a mile away. Contacting a former top US Marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger, Mark Wahlberg, the Secret Service wants to get Swagger to narrow down the three cities that the President is to give an out door address over the next 30 days, when the planned assassination is to take place, to prevent that from happening. Finding Philadelphia as the perfect place for the assassination to be successfully executed Bob Lee Swagger is also to later finds out that he in fact is the pasty chosen, by those behind the scenes, to take the fall for murdering the President of the United States!Everything goes perfectly with President Butler, who had no knowledge of what was happening, in fact used as a ploy to knock off guest speaker Ethiopian Archbishop Desmond Mutubo, Dean McKenzie, who's the real target of the assassination attempt! Knowing within seconds that he's been set up in Mutubo's assassination Swagger makes his escape after being shot by Officer Simmions, Alan Peterson, who's in on the assassination plot, and who's later murdered himself, and is on the run for the remainder of the film.There's the usual and expected heroics by innocent fugitive from the law Swagger who with the help of his former and dead US Marine buddy Donnie Fenn's, Lane Garrison, wife Sarah, Kate Mara, and rookie FBI Agent Nick Memphis, Michael Pena, eventually uncovers who was behind Archbishop Mutubo's assassination. Swagger soon realizes that he in fact was unwittingly responsible for a mass murder committed by a rouge US Government agency headed by the mysterious Col. Isaac Johnson, Danny Glover, some three years ago in Ethiopia! It was this knowledge and his willingness to reveal it to the American public that lead to Archbishop Mutubo's murder!The movie 'Shooter' is filled with shocking revelation in how people high up in the US Government use their office and the power that goes along with it to commit crimes worthy of Nazi Germany and the Stalinist Soviet Union! What makes 'Shooter' so effective and at the same time disturbing is that a lot of what it brings out in its storyline you can read and see in your local newspaper or network TV news show!The only thing about the film that's way off target is its very feel good ending that, despite being one of the best and most exciting sequences of the movie, ruins its credibility which was the best part about it up until then. Still 'Shooter' is not a movie to be ignored, even though many high up in government would want you to, since its one of the most accurate conspiracy film to ever come out of Hollywood! And thats saying something in these troubled times where after 9/11, in fact there's a scene in the movie where Swagger is seen reading a book titled '9/11', where publicly being critical, like 'Shooter' is, of the government can get you either fired from your job or disappeared into a government run hell hole detention camp like Gitmo or Abu Ghraib!",8,2,6,28 August 2008

Getting everything ready for the big assault on Castro's Cuba the meticulously planned attack goes haywire as some 1,500 Cuban exiles and dozens of American mercenaries are caught flat footed and routed by Castro's army and home militia in the swamps and beaches off the infamous 'Bay of Pigs'.Feeling that their operation, CIA code name Zapata, was compromised by someone higher up in the chain of leadership and it would result in the dismantling of the agency, by an outraged and embarrassed President John F. Kennedy,a piece of information gets delivered to Wilson's home. An envelope containing an audio tape and grainy photo of a couple making out in a hotel room. In that tape and photo is the person, a CIA man, who compromised the 'Bay of Pigs' assault. Also in photo is the communist spy who delivered that vital information, via the Soviet Union's KGB, to Castro.As Edward Wilson and his team of CIA electronic and film specialists mill over the tape and photo we get a number of flashbacks of his life in the CIA that started back in 1939. We see the 20 year-old Edward as a student at Yale joining the super secretive Skull & Bones Society. Edward was recruited, like many other Bonesmen, by General Bill Sullivan, Robert De Niro,to serve his country in war as well as peacetime as an undercover spy. Edward's social life as a Bonesman is upended when he's gotten drunk at a Skull & Bones party gathering at Deer Island. It's there where he's seduced by a hot to trot Clover Russell, Angelina Jolie, Edwards best friend and fellow bones-man John Russell, Gabriel Macht, horny sister. Edwards who was having an affair with hearing impaired Laura, Tammy Blanchard, had to cut it short when he found out, from her brother John, that Clover was pregnant and was forced into a shotgun wedding. In the end that not only resulted in the birth of his one and only child Edward Jr,Eddie Redmayne, but also his driving Clover, now calling herself Margaret, almost to a nervous breakdown. This all happened some 18 years later when he met, at a play, and rekindled his relationship with Laura.By the film jumping from the 'Bay of Pigs' fiasco to Edward's past in his rise in the CIA you start to lose your footing getting a feeling of lost time as you can't differentiate between the past and the present. Theresalso the fact that Edward Wilson never seems to change looking like he hasn't aged at all in over 22 years. We get to see a number of double-crosses assassinations and regime changes that Edward was involved in over the years. His biggest boner, from this Bonesman and CIA chief, being his allowing a KBG operative Valentin Mironov, John Session, to get asylum in the US and having him feed the CIA false information in what, the then almost unknown, Fidel Castro was really all about. The US ended up giving Castro military equipment to overthrow the Betista regime in Havana only to have it be replaced with a Soviet satellite just 90 miles off the coast of Key West Florida!We later find out that this KGB agent Mironov, code name Cold, was probably one of two Soviet spies, with the unknown woman in the grimly photo being the other, who tipped off the Cuban Communists about the 'Bay of Pigs' invasion! When the truth comes out about another KGB agent, Mark Ivanir, also calling himself Mironov who gave himself up to the CIA in order to get asylum. Instead of being debriefed Mironov II was brutally beaten and tortured, by the gleeful and sadistic CIA investigator Ray Brocco ,John Torturro. Mironov II going completely wacko from what he was put through jumps out a ten story window killing himself. It turned that this Mironov was the real deal not the Mironov working with the CIA all these years. In the end this goof-up not only got Edward in hot water with his superiors the President and CIA Director but also his son Edward Jr as well. Edward Jr while taking a bath overheard pop planning the attack with a number of his CIA friends. Edward Jr later ended up spilling what he knew as he was making out with his girlfriend Miriam, Liya Kebede, the woman in both the mysterious tape and photo that Edward Sr received. It turned out that it was Edward Jr who was responsible for the disastrous 'Bay of Pigs' invasion. The photo, and audio tape, that Edward mysterious got was to have him blackmailed by the KBG into doing it's bidding by selling out his country.Very hard to follow spy film with people popping up and then disappearing so fast that you don't even have time to get their names much less find out what their doing in the movie in the first place. The film has a mindless and unbelievable ending that tries to make everything, that you saw up until them, look good for the very dull and almost asleep Edward Wilson It does that by having him not have to turn in Jr for his stupidity in letting the cat, the assault on Castro's Cuba, out of the bag. Yet at the same time have him break up a secret KGB ring inside the CIA that he, together with that vicious thug Brocco, brainlessly allowed to infiltrate!",5,1,3,10 February 2007
Scream," We all go a little mad sometimes
","***SPOILERS*** Director Wes Cravens, who plays Fred the janitor at Woodsboro High School, craven attempt to make the ultimate teenage slasher film hits the bullseye with his 1996 smash hit 'Scream' that has all the elements of every slasher movie known to man, or the movie audience, in it.Played along the lines of the 1978 horror thriller 'Halloween' which is seen on TV all throughout the movie 'Scream' has this masked psycho tearing up all of Woodsboro in pursuit of Sidney Prescott who for some reason he has it in for. The cues to the psychos maniacal hatred towards Sidney are many with the most obvious being that her deceased mom was up to something no good when she was brutally murdered a year ago. But as the movie goes on it becomes evident that all the movie, and Wes Craven, is trying to do is out do every teenage slasher film that proceeded it and does an excellent, and gory, job in doing it.We have such a diverse cast from a wild eyed Linda Blair paying an obnoxious and shrieking reporter as well as Henry ' The Fonz' Winkler as the strict disciplinarian principle Arthur Himbry, of Woodsboro High. It's in fact principle Himbry, together with about two dozen other Woodboro residents, who ends up being one of the Psycho's many victims in the movie. Himbry is attacked murdered as well as, thank God off screen, gutted and hung from the high school's football goalpost for sticking his nose where it shouldn't belong! The psycho killers business! The killing goes on at such a fast pace that you eventually don't seem to care anymore for those who get offed by the masked psycho in that they, like in almost every other teenage slasher films, are made to look, by their wild sex and drug parties, like they more then deserve what's coming to them.The ending sequence that takes some 15 minutes is so off the wall and ridicules that by then you get the feeling that you've been had by Director Wes Craven's attempt to out do the teenage slasher genre to the point where the film, despite the massive blood letting in it, is more of a comedy then a horror movie. All you have to really do in finding out who's to be killed or not to be killed in the film is to see who's either naughty, besides the psycho killer, or nice in it. With those being naughty, fooling around and getting high on booze or drugs, making up almost 98% of the, movie's cast members!",7,0,1,4 May 2010
Paths of Glory," I have just one thing to tell you and that's the person that you stabbed in the back is a solider!
","***SPOILERS*** Kirk Douglas at his teeth grinding and eye popping best was never better as French Army Colonel Dax who's put in a dilemma in trying to save three of his men Cpl. Paris, Ralph Meeker, Pvt. Auban, Joe Turkel, and Pvt. Ferol, Timothy Carey, from being executed for cowardice to cover-up the mindless and disastrous mistakes of their superior officer scare faced General Mireau, George Mecready.It's 1916 and there's a two year stalemate on the Western Front with the German and French armies locked into bloody combat with tens of thousands of men being killed and wounded in the fighting. Told by his boss General Broulard, Adolphe Menjou, to take the blood soaked Anthill from German hands Gen. Mireau at first is taken back by his superior's almost insane demand. The Anthill has been in German hands for the last two years despite being bombarded and assaulted by hundreds of thousand of French combat troops who were beaten back at every attempt; Suffering tens of thousand of casualties! Now Gen. Broulard expects Gen. Mireau to get the job done in one day with only a regiment of 8,000 French war weary and shell shocked troops!As expected the assault on The Anthill was a total disaster with the Germans mowing down those French troopers who went over the top of the trenches as well as pinning down the French reserves who were supposed to do the mopping up after them. At the height of the fighting Gen. Mireau frustrated that his men, whom almost 90% were either dead wounded and no longer combat ready, weren't getting the job done ordered his own artillery units to bombarded them in order to get them to move forward! It's later when looking for a scapegoat for both his Gen. Mireau and his superior Gen. Broulard's failures it's decided to take three French soldiers involved in the failed assault on the Anthill, Cpl. Paris Pvt. Auban & Pvt. Ferol, and make them pay with their lives for their mistakes! Volunteering to defend his men in a military style kangaroo court Col.Dax knows that he's up against it in getting his clients, the three condemned French soldiers, off. But still hopes that he can at least get them to tell their stories and maybe just maybe get some sympathy from those robot-like French officers judging them. Which in fact turned out to be a task ever more difficult if not as impossible then his men taking the Anthill!***SPOILERS*** Great courtroom drama with Col.Dax getting stymied at every turn by the French Army brass in saving his men from execution. It's disgusting to watch how those French officers in charge of the 'trial' didn't give a lick about the men whom they were judging not at all caring if they were or were not cowards under fire but doing everything to clear the real culprit's in this matter, the disastrous assault on the Anthill, Gen Broulard & Gen. Mireau from any responsibility! You don't have to guess what the results of the trial for the three condemned French soldiers was but there indeed was a real big surprise waiting for us in what happened later on in the film. Like rats turning on each other Gen. Broulard exposed Gen. Mireu's insane decision to kill his own men, by artillery fire, as some sort of revenge against them for not fully obeying his insane order to move ahead in a kamikaze like suicide assault against murderous German machine-gun and artillery fire. It turned out to be a small victory of sorts on Col. Dax's part in that he was the person who informed Gen, Broulard, with documented proof, of Gen.Mireau deranged order. But it came far too late to save the men that he was defending!P.S As for the devious and back stabbing Gen. Broulard who was even more responsible for the disastrous Anthill assault the Gn. Mireau he ended up washing his hands of the whole messy matter which was the biggest outrage of all the other outrages in the entire film!",8,0,1,25 July 2012
Final Destination," It doesn't matter who's next! Because were all on the same list!
","**SPOILER ALERT** When 17 year old high school student Alex Browning, Devon Sawa, gets a sudden premonition of being killed, together with passengers and crew, on flight 180 from NY to Paris his actions leads to some of his fellow passengers to bolt from the plane in feeling that he may well be on to something. As fate would have it flight 180 explodes, just like Alex predicted, and crashes in flames in the Atlantic Ocean just minutes after it took off!It's later that Alex realizes that somehow he and those who left the plane with him cheated death's grand plan that it had in store for them on flight 180. With the exception of Terry (Amanda Detmer), one of these who left flight 180 before it took off, the rest of those survivors who were later killed died in a number of complicated Rube Goldburg-like scenarios that took as much as five minutes to finally snuff them out.Alex somehow figures out, by watching the news of the plane crash on TV, the path of the explosion on the plane that hit the very seats that he and the other survivors of the plane crash were assigned to! And with that Alex could now predict, by the sequence of who's seat on the plane the fireball first hit, who'll among those who survived will be the next persons to die. This of course has everyone, including the local police and FBI, feel that Alex was somehow responsible for the taking down of flight 180! But just how he could have known that the plane was going to crash is anyone's guess! Was it sabotage? Was it that Alex knew that there was a bomb planted on the plane by terrorists? Or the most obvious explanation, and at the same time least scientific, is it that Alex could really see into the future and thus saw what was going to happen to flight 180 far, like 10 minutes, in advance!***SPOILERS*** The film starts to get a bit off base even in its storyline in the sequences of those who are to be killed, according to the explosion pattern on the doomed plane, that you get lost watching it. Alex for all his proved paranormal powers is totally ineffective in convincing anyone of those targeted by death-until it's almost too ate-that the end for them is going to come and come real soon. Pretty good horror/thriller even though it's, seeing one's death in the future, been done dozens of times before but never with-the mind-boggling death scenes-the ingenuity that's in it!",7,0,1,24 July 2009
Munich," I don't exist and you don't know me!
","****SPOILERS**** Planning to put the Israeli/Palestinian dispute on the front pages of the world's major newspapers the shadowy Black September group storms the Israeli dorm, in the Olympic village, where it's Olympic athlete's are housed in Munich Germany. Within 24 hours, September 5/6, 1972, during a tense and nail-biting stand-off all eleven Israeli captives and their eight Palestinian captors are killed in a shootout and grenade assault between the German police and Black September terrorists.Back in Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir,Lynn Cohen, gets the heads of the Mossad and IDF, Israeli Defense Forces,to plan what to do in the aftermath of the murdered 11 Israeli athletes. Even more important Premier Meir wants to show that actions like that in Munich will not go unavenged and unpunished. Trying to distance herself and her government Premier Meir has a secret group of Israelis assassins lead by her former bodyguard Avner, Eric Bana, get all the money and assistance that they need in finding the Munich 11, the Black September members who planned the Munich attack, and bring them to justice; instant justice with Avner and his men being judge jury & executioner.The movie 'Munich' has Avner and his fellow covert Israeli Government assassins track down most of the Black September killers terminating seven of them including scores of accomplices by the time Avner's group was finally disbanded by Prime Minister Meir in June 1973. Still the Israeli hit team was unable to find and terminate the Big Salami and leader of the bunch who's name ironically is Ali Hassan Salameh, Mehdi Nebbon; were told at the end of he movie 'Munich' that Ali Hassan Salameh was indeed killed by the Israeli Mossad in 1979.Penetrating and thought provoking real life thriller that shows the fine line between the Israeli hunters and Palestinian hunted. We also see how they suddenly switch later in the movie when the Black September terrorists start to turn the tables on the Israelis by tricking and trapping three of their agents, with the help of a beautiful but deadly Dutch femme fatal Jeanette(Marie Josee-Croze),leading to their deaths.Avner who was so eager and determined to do his job later started to get sick of killing and even felt a bit of sympathy for the hated Palestinians seeing that they, like himself an Israeli Jew, have a right to live in a land of their own. There's a very emotional exchange between Avner and Black September member Ali, Omar Metwally, who didn't know that he, Avnar, was Jewish and a Israeli covert agent out to kill him, which he did. This talk with Ali seemed to open Avnar up to seeing things beyond what he'd been exposed to as an Israeli, or native born Sabra, all his life. The movie ends with Avner together with his wife Daphna, Ayelet Zorner,and new born daughter living in Brooklyn New York unable or not wanting to return back to his native Israel and having nightmares over what he did and went through as a Israeli assassin. Avner now feels that he may well be terminated himself by the very people, the Israeli Mossad who he so secretly and effectively worked for. The reason Avner felt that way may have been because he couldn't keep what he did locked up within the four corners of his troubled mind.",8,30,55,2 January 2006
Cinderella Man," Going the Distance, both in and out of the Ring
","(Some Spoilers) Increidable but true depression era rags to riches 'Cinderella Story' about the amazing comeback of boxer James 'The Bergen New Jersey Bulldog' Braddock, Russell Crowe, who went from having to go on welfare, which he later honestly paid back, to be able to care for his family to become the Heavyweight Champion of the World. All this within the space of less then two short but unforgettable years. A major prospect for becoming the Light-Heavyweight Champion of the world back in the late 1920's Braddock was soundly beaten on July 18, 1929 in a match with the fast fisted and fleet footed light heavyweight Tommy Loughran. Three months after the Loughran bout the Stock Market crashed and Jimmy, like tens of millions of fellow Americans, faced a bleak future with the high-living and fast-spending years of the 1920's becoming a distant memory with the Great Depresion descending upon America. We see Jimmy four years later in 1933 at the end of the line as a professional boxer in his dull and boring match with Abe Feldman ,which ended after six rounds as a no contest. In his dressing room Jimmy is found to have broken his right hand and the New York State Boxing Commission has his boxing license revoked. The winter of 1933/34 was a cold and bitter one for the Braddock's with the heat turned off, because Jimmy was unable to pay the utilities, and with the Baddock's children being sent away, for a short time, to family members in Brooklyn because him and his wife Mae, Renee Zellweger, couldn't care for them. This really hurt Jimmy since he swore to his young son Jay never to give him or his brother and sister Howard & Rosey away to relatives no matter what happened. By the late spring of 1934 Jimmy was at the end of his rope with little or no work on the Jersey docks, because of his broken right hand, and no chance to get back in the ring. It's then just like in the movies, mind you this is a true story, a miracle happened to Jimmy which also reflected, and uplifted, his friends and family and everyone else in America who had their hopes and dreams dashed to pieces by the Great Depression. It's was then that Jimmy's former manager Joe Gould, Paul Glamatti, got him a match, as well as his license back to box with his right hand having mended,on the under-card of the Heavyweight Championship fight between the champ Primo Carnera, Matthew G. Taylor, and the very dangerous challenger Max Baer, Craig Blerko. Jimmy was picked by boxing promoter James Johnston, Bruce McGill,as a sacrificial lamb to be knocked out by the highly touted Corn Griffin, Art Binkowski. In the fight the desperate and brave Jimmy Barddock, after taking everything that Griffin threw at him,floored Griffin in the third round to the astonishment of everyone watching! With his boxing career now back on track Jimmy went on to beat John Henry Lewis, who beat Jimmy in a ten round decision in San Fanciso two years earlier, on Nevember 16, 1934. Jimmy then went on to defeat the very powerful and hard hitting Art Lasky on March 22, 1935 with is fancy footwork and superior boxing abilities.This set the scene up for the Heavyweight Championship bout between Jimmy and Max Baer in the Long Island Bowl on June 13, 1935. Exactly a year after he began his comeback by knocking out Corn Griffin in the same arena, Madison Square Garden, that Max Baer won the coveted title. Jimmy, given no chance at all by the experts to defeat the 'Big Bad Baer', In one of the most exciting and heart lifting boxing sequences ever put in a movie, as well as happening in real life, took the fight to Baer right from the opening bell. Freely mixing it with the champ Jimmy took everything that the 'Killer' Max Baer could hit him with and gave back as good as he got in return. Clowning around at first Baer got serious later opening up on Jimmy with all the heavy artillery he had in his boxing gloves.With tremendous courage, and ring savvy and boxing finesse, Jimmy fending off Baer's wild and desperate assaults in the late rounds was still holding on to a slim, but diminishing, lead as the bout went the full distance going into the 15th round. In the fateful last round with him ahead on all cards Jimmy instead of trying to avoid Baer's punches, and run out the clock in order to win the Heavyweight Championship, mixed it up and stood toe to toe with the champ in the most exciting round of the entire fight. In the end Jimmy walked away with the title in a unanimous decision that left the crowd, at first quite and sullen, at the Long Island Bowl in complete pandemonium. Jimmy Braddock's amazing victory gave the American people something to cheer about during those dark and bleak depression years. Jimmy Bradock was an underdog in every sense of the word yet overcame all the obstacles that were placed in front of him. In the end Jimmy showed that no matter how bad things are faith and belief in oneself is the most powerful force that one can have. And with that faith one can not only succeed over unbelievable odds but inspire others to do the same as well. One of the most moving scenes in the movie 'Cinderella Man' came just before the fight between Jimmy Braddock and Max Baer as Jimmy's wife Mae went into her church to light a candle and say a prayer for her courageous and valiant husband. To Mae's astonishment she saw that almost the entire town of North Bergen New Jersey were in the church doing the exact same thing!",10,5,11,6 June 2005
