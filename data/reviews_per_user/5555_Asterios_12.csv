Vertigo," How can you say bad a movie directed before 50 years?
","Some people think that because they have watched 1 millionmovies are good judges and can say whatever they want.The truthis that whatever anybody says this movie along with someothers(Rear Window etc) are classic thriller's.What is a thriller? Can anybody watch Sixth Sense second time?It is what causesyou the first time that counts.You can not watch it second time ,because when you re-watch it you try to see other things that donot really count in a movie.Get in the shoes of a guy that maybe didnot have a TV and went to see that movie.What movies he hasseen so far?That is why they loved it.Now  maybe Scream scareus more than this.BUT this movie was bloody 50 years before!!!!!!!You can't expect something so old to amuse you.Go seeKing Kong.When they saw it back then they thought WOW....now Ichange channel. The first time I saw this movie I was amused.",Null,0,4,28 December 2001
X-Men," Very good movie,more than anybody expexted
",It is common that when somebody tries to make a movie out of a TV series to just blow everything and confuse theaudience.X-MEN actually is a very good adoption of theseries with a delicate touch of adventure and good plot.This is the kind of movie the BIG cinema screens exist.It is obvious that a sequel should be expected for thisone.Highly recommended!!!,Null,0,0,15 October 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Nothing happened
",I don't understand what the director was thinking.What is the bigstory behind this movie?Lucas is the best storyteller??What is thestory here? It was sad that there was progress in the story as everyone wasexpecting to see how Anakin will evolve to Darth Vader.,7,0,0,19 May 2002
The Godfather: Part II," Simply the best !
","I think that this is the greatest movie ever made . It can only be Godfather I better than this one . However here we have a much better job and much more professional , by people who already had success with the first episode . If episode I was the beginning , this one is something far more than the sequel.",Null,0,0,12 May 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," I do not believe the fass about this story and movie
","I just want to ask all the people some questions.Is it possible to take over the world if you are not able to survive an attack from some tree's that throwstones???Well probably not mr Sarouman.Maybe next time leave behind some3000 people to feel safe. What is all the story with Gandalf grey becoming white??Did he download apatch??Well ok , it has nice cinematography , it is quite enjoyable but I could be asking questions all day about the story. The moral??In order to categorize a movie in the best 10 or 20 of all time , it needs to be something more real.The godfather was real.This is just a bedtime story so we need to treat it as one.....",8,0,0,25 December 2002
The Game," Classic!
","I saw people here say that this is a great film and I had to know it myself.This film is one of the greatest thriller's.You do not know what will happen next and very few can predict where it will all end to.Some people will not probably think that some things that happen in this movie are possible,but tell me a movie possible things happen all the time.",10,0,2,30 May 1999
Mission: Impossible II," One man show.....
","Well when Jordan scores 50 points in a basketball game we kindof expected that and like it.But when a known series like missionimpossible was based on team work you expect to see this in themovie also.In the first one we saw it , on this one Cruise wantedeverything for himself.Cruise is one of the most overated people inHistory.Can anybody remember 3 good movies that he has everplayed??",1,1,2,29 December 2001
Mission: Impossible," reality?
","Some people complain when they go to action films that some ofthe stuff are impossible to happen.Well turn on the TV and thewhole day you see shows with this kind of things,makingimpossible things to happen.Even in comedies people do stupidthings to amuse us.So why not in action movies?Ok this was notthe best action movie, and certainly wasted the talent of somegood cast members by killing them in the first 20 min , but it was anice film to watch and looked like the series.The sequel wasofcourse whan of the worse 10 movies of all time......",8,0,1,29 December 2001
Life Is Beautiful," Go see it now !
",Well anybody at least not emotionally shaken by this film has a serious problem of taste . This is film is a pure classic . Beligni is excellent . 15/10,Null,1,2,15 February 1999
The Godfather: Part III," Not bad,not good
","The bad thing about sequels is that inevitably they are compared with the previous parts.Godfather ofcourse could not be the exception , especially after the success of the second movie.I think in Godfather III we have an attempt to show that everybody gets what he deserves in life.Michael has sinned(especially by killing his brother) and god has punished him for that.This kind of relates with the plot as we had a Vatikan conspiracy ,which in my opinion was a mickey mouse story.You just cannot kill the pope like that ! I wonder whose idea was that. The actor really missed here is Robert Dyvall.",Null,1,2,19 May 1999
The Waterboy," Good movie,fun to watch.But just that !!!!!
","Adam Sandler is performing great . I think he will be in very good roles soon . The film is quite funny with some scenes that can make you cry from laughs ! Better than average comedies . If you have time see it , or wait to rent it on tape.",Null,1,2,10 May 1999
The Matrix," Oh my god , what was that ?
","Having heard so many things about this movie I was expecting something good.But this movie was not just good.It was the best sci-fi movie I have ever seen . Especially the parts with the fights were so good that I could not believe my eyes that this was not Teken 3 on a playstation I was watching.Also this movie projects some ideas about life that are quite interesting.Do not wait to rent,go and see it now !",10,0,0,10 September 1999
