The King's Speech," Brilliant film, and a new side of Colin Firth
","After hearing all of the buzz about this film, I was so curious to see how the subject matter could be made interesting/compelling enough to make a great film. It was.Not only beautifully filmed, but all of the actors were magnificent. No overacting, plenty of humor, but not gratuitous. There was no flash, but the costuming was sublime. This offers an intimate view of a very special moment in history and how it played out in the lives of some very special people. A behind the scenes look at the life of 'the royals' which is timely and ongoing, as is our fascination with them.I highly recommend this film.",10,0,1,2 February 2011
