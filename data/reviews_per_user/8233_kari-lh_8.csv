The Avengers," Amazing!
",I gotta say when I went to the cinema I had high expectations. But this movie went over my expectations. It has a good storyline and I like the idea of putting many known heroes in the same movie. Actually I wonder why no one has done that before in a Hollywood movie recently. It was fun to watch these brilliant characters come together and fight together.One of the good things about this movie is that it has the humor from Iron man which is excellent. Even though this movie is an action movie with a lot of explosions it has scenes where everyone in the cinema laughed so much you couldn't hear the movie anymore. The action part is also great. It hasn't got too much special effects and every single on of them is accurate. In fact all of the computer work is brilliant. The acting is very good too. All the actors get their characters so well. Robert is so great at acting Tony Stark you could think he isn't acting.I didn't see any fails or wanted something different and I had a real blast while watching so it deserves nothing less than a 10/10.,10,3,8,8 May 2012
Argo," Starting to think the Oscar is a mafia
","First of all, I had to see this film because it won the best picture and honestly it looked as if it was very good. But as I watched it, I became more and more disappointed.I thought it was interesting that the plot is based on a true story about this very unusual rescue mission preformed by the CIA.After watching for a while I started to notice the classical 'Hollywood' theme were almost every aspect of the story was exaggerated to create a more excitement for the viewers.But this is not the worst thing. In reality Americans never knew of this operation because CIA gave Canada all the credit. The American nation wasn't told of this until some president unclassified this about 15 - 20 years ago. But that wasn't enough so in 2012 movie producers probably sat down and said 'we need to make an award winning film to show the whole world it was we the Americans not the Canadians that did this astonishing rescue mission.' So the hidden message of this film is 'America is the best country in all of the known world.' At the end you can see the American flag in the background so at least your subconscious would notice it. That is the flaw of many Hollywood movies.Overall the sets, the shots, the acting are good, but not outstanding. About the same quality you see in most blockbusters.So if you are not a true American 'patriot' you will probably not like this movie very much. There is nothing wrong in being proud of your country but this is crossing way over the line in my opinion.",4,7,10,29 April 2013
Dunkirk," Dunkirk was exactly what I had anticipated it to be, and then some
","To put it into simple terms, Dunkirk is the best cinematic experience I've had in years.Once the credits started rolling, I was lost for words. So strong had the impact of this film been upon me. I was clearly not the only one, as the whole theater was silent. It was as if we were all soldiers returning home from an hour and three quarters of war experience.From the moment when the first bullet is fired, we're are completely submerged into the narrative. The story focuses on three narratives in three different settings, that all tie together in the events at Dunkirk 76 years ago. The inter-cutting between these different narratives is brilliantly done, where all the stories serve as a companion to one another, despite being fundamentally different. Alhtough a story structure like this is not common in cinema, I believe it works perfectly for the atmosphere Nolan wanted to create.The craftsmanship in this film is absolutely stunning. Every aspect of this film is masterfully crafted, and flows with each other to create the perfect harmony. That's because the film isn't trying to show off how great certain aspects are. It's all about creating the experience of watching it. That is also the reason why the narrative isn't in a traditional war epic format. That's because this film doesn't take you on a journey so to speak, as it provides you with the experience of war. It is a very tense experience that leaves you with no real breaks to settle down. That's because you constantly feel like you are one of the soldiers depicted on screen. I feel inclined to add that this film may not be a good experience for people who have experienced combat, or have been severely affected by it. This is also not a film you should see if you have a history with drowning. Luckily I've not been affected by either, but I can still imagine how it must have felt like. That's how real the experience of watching this film really is.I would strongly recommend seeing this film in theaters. That is mostly because of how amazing the sound design is. As I said before, no single aspect takes over another, but the sound design is undeniably a crucial part of creating the atmosphere. The experience is therefore best if watched with good surround sound being blasted all around you, while your eyes are stuck to the big screen.One of the best things about this story is that it doesn't really pick a side. The film only shows you one side, but moral questions regarding the men you are fighting are left out. The film also doesn't talk about the horrors of war. It simply shows you what it was like. This ties into the fact that this story isn't a journey. It is an intense experience.The atmosphere this film offers is so intense that you can feel the salty breeze from the sea, mixed in with the horrible smell of dead corpses. Throughout the entire film, you feel like you are there with the soldiers. We care for them, we fear for them, and we emphasize for them. That's simply because we are one of them. Or at least that's what it feels like.In the end we are all like the silent spitfire gliding through the air, as we admire the bravery of the people depicted on screen. So strong is the will to help those in need, that men and women alike risked their lives to save the soldiers trapped at Dunkirk. It is about the power of people to sacrifice in order to save, even when faced with a great adversary. This message, combined with the extraordinary experience, is what makes Dunkirk a true masterpiece.",10,4,11,21 July 2017
Black Hawk Down," Some where there to kick ass, others to try to make a difference
","This film is about a simple mission that is supposed to take an hour maximum. That soon changes into a full blown battle when a black hawk is shot down. At that moment the U.S. forces loose their initiative and complete chaos breaks out in the streets of Mogadishu as the soldiers are heavily outnumbered trying to stay alive and most importantly keeping their friends alive too. The only advantage they have is their training although many lack the experience.But what is it that makes this film so good? For me it's the reality. Although I have never seen war with my own eyes this film is what I think comes the closest to showing the brutality of warfare. Ridley Scott is a genius in making the perfect atmosphere and that is not lacking in this film.But why is this film more realistic than most other war films? I noticed one thing while watching which takes a huge part in this films excellence. In the battle scenes, everything happens very fast. There are no pausing moments even though something tragic happens there are no close ups of the soldiers faces or emotional music in the background. The battle continues in the same speed as before much like in reality. Now you may be thinking 'but what kind of a war film doesn't have emotional scenes?' Well this film has emotional scenes and lots of them. They just don't happen in the heat of the battle but instead when the battle slows down or when the soldiers are in a safe place for the time being. It's then when they have time to take a breath and get their minds straight. Thats when they realize all the horror that has taken place. That has a lot of effect on the viewers as well because now we have time to think about the previous events. If you have ever been in a tough situation where you are suddenly in a danger of harming yourself you would know that you don't really think about what to do, you just do it. It isn't until it's over when you realize what has happened.Another thing that helps to make this film so real is that there is no main character. You get to know a few characters but none of them is more important than the other. Ofcurse some have more screen time than others but I think it's very well balanced. Having many characters and no hero that tells the story makes it much easier to connect to them and place yourself in their steps.I think this is the best anti war film ever made. Yes this is an anti war film although it tells a true story about a 'successful' mission. First of all because the amount of reality as I have talked about, and secondly this mission wasn't really that successful. The tragic truth is that 19 men died in vain. Aidid was still in command. Although he was not the key to the crisis because if you look at Somalia today 20 years later it's still pretty much the same.This film isn't about the mission itself or whether it was successful or not. It's about the men that fight the battle. Even though I think those men died in vain, they are no less heroes as other brave soldiers who die in war. They are heroes because they always look out for each other and leave no man behind. Hoot describes it very well when he explains why he is always on the front lines. 'They wouldn't understand why we do it, they wouldn't understand that it's about the man next to you.' And for me that is what this film is all about. These soldiers are trying to make a difference, to watch out for each other, make sure every one gets home alive. It's just that you don't have much luck trying to make a difference with a gun in your hand.I said earlier that I haven't seen war with my own eyes, but this I know well. My fathers older brother worked for the red cross in Afghanistan 6 months before the battle of Mogadishu. He was shot down trying to safe wounded men. He is the only Icelander that has died working for the red cross. Although that is 3 years before I was born I fully understand this event. He knew the risks but the will to help people who needed it badly that is what kept him working there. It's pretty much the same for those soldiers fighting on the streets of Mogadishu watching out for each other. But their job was not to help people, their job was to fight back. They were all trying the best they could to help but that doesn't really work well with a gun in your hand.In the end this film tells the true story of the soldiers fighting the battle of Mogadishu. No Hollywood style action and no unrealistic events. It tells the truth.",10,2,3,17 November 2013
Everest," The summit is not just a goal, it's the peak of dedication
","Everest is a film about various climbers from different backgrounds, who each has their own motives to reach the top. Many of those climbers are amateurs facing the inhuman environment of Everest with the help of professional guides. The guides help them reach the top but their primary job is to get them home safe. That proves very difficult when a ravaging storm hits the mountain when most of the climbers are taking their final steps towards the summit.What do people do in situations of life and death? Do you risk your life to safe others or will you safe your own skin? Everest is a magnificent story about real humans battling forces of nature, more than 8 km above sea level. What you get is a breathtaking experience where you follow each character so closely, you merge into their lives for 2 hours.Baltasar Kormákur is starting to make a name for himself as a director. This is the first film he really gets to show what he is made of. Everest is the kind of film where every aspect needs to be carefully thought of in order for the film to be enjoyable. Baltasar Kormákur did an excellent job by creating this masterpiece.Baltasar is the first great Icelandic director. Being Icelandic myself I was really looking forward to see this film. I knew it had received good criticism and I had therefore very high expectations. I can safely say that this film exceeded those expectations.All in all, I think this film delivered the story perfectly. You feel as if you are a part of the expedition. You not only feel the characters' struggle, you take part in it with them. A great film I would recommend to everyone.",10,0,2,1 October 2015
Vanilla Sky," This movie makes no sense!
",At the end of this movie you just stand up from the couch really confused. It's not because you didn't get the plot it's just that it looks like the plot was written by a crazy man who didn't know the difference between reality and dreams.This movie starts out OK but gets more and more twisted the longer you watch it. This constant changing between reality and dream doesn't function very well when you never know which is what and it constantly changes so the reality isn't so real anymore. The whole concept of this plot is so far fetched that an ordinary mind can never buy it. Instead it makes you feel a little crazy when figuring out what it's about.It's not just the plot thats wrong but it's incredibly boring too. I fell asleep twice before I could finish it. It is 136 minuets but should be around 90 minuets since there's nothing important happening except a few things. I'm not saying I can't handle long movies because most of my favorites are 2-3 hours.The acting in this movie is not bad. Tom Cruise acts very well specially in the motional scenes. But it needs a bit more than a good acting to make this movie worth watching.Overall this is the worst movie I've ever seen. A lot of people I know fully agree with that statement. I find it strange to see that this movie is not on the bottom 250. Maybe it's just that the people around me have different opinions than most other people. But remember that this is only my opinion and although it's hard with this one I respect other opinions as well.,1,1,3,31 March 2012
Gladiator," Brilliant, brilliant and brilliant. Did I say brilliant?
","Gladiator deserves nothing else than a 10! It has amazing shots, sets, story, music, acting and screenplay overall. The story is also historically accurate.From the moment I start watching and till the end of it I am amazed by it. This is and will probably be my favorite movie ever made.There is only one thing I would change. I would have removed the guy wearing jeans. Everything else is perfect.This film is and will always be a piece of art.Thats all I have to say, hope you all agree with me.",10,2,7,9 July 2012
The Island," Skip the flying trains and super Bond stunts and it would be brilliant
","What I really like about this movie is the plot. At first you are always wondering, having doubts and speculations about whats really going on. Later on you are given clues and you start to put all the puzzle pieces together. After that the chase begins with good special effects, stunts and explosions.The problem though is that sometimes it's too much. Like in the scene were Lincoln steals the flying bike and is suddenly an expert on it and is able to beat the specially trained men in the chase. In my opinion it would be better if he would steal an ordinary bike and loose them that way, he would know how because of memories from the real Lincoln. If that had happened, the scene were they fell 50 stories and somehow survived wouldn't have happened at all. Also what I consider a small flaw is all the technology in such a near future, like the flying trains. It would have been better if it was 2029 but not 2019 and if they would skip some of the unnecessary futuristic mechanics which are unrealistic.Besides that the movie was great. The sets, the storyline, the music, the shots were all amazing. Ewan's acting was great and the acting overall was good.Over all a great movie. It's sad to see all the negative reviews. I think some of them are just because The Island is a Michael Bay film and they tend to get negative reviews just because they are Michael Bay films.",9,0,1,27 December 2012
