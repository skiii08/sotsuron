Requiem for a Dream," brilliant movie
","Aronofsky proves once again what a visual stylist he is. He gaveJennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn chances after Hollywood snubbed themand the performances are amazing. A harrowing tale of loneliness andaddictions, this movie pulls your soul out through your ears. Sounddesign is absolutely amazing and fellinies",10,0,1,4 October 2002
Catch Me If You Can," A cute Christmas film about thrity minutes too long
","I, like many proud Jews, find Speilberg to be a total hyporctie and totop that off, I always get bored in his movies save for private ryan.However, this movie was fun. It was very lighthearted and ChristopherWalken shines, giving a fabulous performance. Tom Hanks was good butdidnt really impress me and his character was annoying. I thought Leowas very charming but despite the good performances I began to berestless, the two and a half hour film could have been about thirtyminutes shorter. Maybe read someone's review who actually likesSpeilberg and his",6,0,4,6 June 2003
Little Miss Sunshine," Just....brilliant
","I saw this film in a movie theatre in Times Square...hardly my first choice for viewing movies. But I will say that Little Miss Sunshine is so excellent, that you could screen the movie in Siberia or in a Wal Mart parking lot in Missouri... and the audience will be transfixed and fall in love.So many indie movies are so quirky that they mean little to anyone other than the actual filmmaker. And other indie movies fall too much into the 'it was a dramatic road trip but we are all so much happier now that we made it' category. Little Miss Sunshine, while quirky and dramatic, never treads these lines. Instead, what you find is a brilliant movie that makes you laugh, that makes your eyes tear, that makes you cringe and reminds you of your family in some shape or form.If anything, it is a story about who we are, and who we often end stuck with.",10,3,7,27 July 2006
Schindler's List," A copout!!!!
","Warning, I am one of those Jewish people who has never been so offended in my life. This film shows that Speilberg cares only about likeable characters and whimsy. What a copout! Jews in this film are only shown as rambling ethnicities in tableau shots. Speilberg would rather take a German Gentile, ficitonalize his story (that speech he gives at the end as Schindler is about to leave and Stein gives him the ring was made up, it is historically incorrect and totally made up) and make a movie about the Holocaust from that point of view. My grandmother, who was a Holocaust survivior, walked out in tears from the theatre claiming his film was all lies.Spielberg makes lovely shots, just beautifully photographed, of violence. This is suppose to make us feel the pain, to feel the irony and all it really does is fetishize violence.  We don't learn anything about the jews in this film so it doesn't even hurt that much. Historically incorrect, Speilberg has the nerve to send the Jews to Auschwitz until Schindler can fix the mistake. UM excuse me by the time Schindler had a list, Auschwitz was practically empty and was no longer gassing bodies. If you want a real look at the holocaust, look at the footage actual nazi soldiers shot in the camps. Or read books by the surviovors. Don't watch Schindlers List because all you will get is a redemption story, designed to make us feel as if we too, like Schindler, would save the Jews. It's embarrassing and inaccurate. How dare Spielberg bastardize the pain my heritage, my family, and other Jewish families went through, make it historically inaccurate and then give it to schools around the country? Yep, thats cool.",6,10,27,10 December 2002
The Truman Show," A brilliant meditation of The Republics Book 8...
","It seems lost on people that The Truman Show stems from Platosphilosophy, mainly Book Eight of the Republic. Brilliant references, forexample Truman finds truth when he meets Laurel/Sylia (tricked man findstruth in nature). Peter Weir is a thoughtful director, coaching abrilliant performance out of Jim Carrey who can do drama as well ascomedy. The movie is vague but not because of lack of thought. A greatfilm and touching. Beautiful soundtrack. I would have loved to speakwith the art director, sets and design are great. A definate 10 all of",10,0,1,15 December 2002
