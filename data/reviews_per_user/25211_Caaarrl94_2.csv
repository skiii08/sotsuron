Requiem for a Dream," Everybody should see this movie.
","This is a near masterpiece. I have just watched this movie and I can tell you this is the first time i've cried over a movie in a very long time. I have a feeling this one will resonate inside me for ever.I don't have many words to say about this movie apart from you must watch it. It's one of the finest movies i've ever seen with glimmers of absolute cinematic perfection.The acting, cinematography, excellent sound track, editing. Everything about this movie is near perfect. Jared Leto gives the performance of his career in my opinion. Don't expect a Martin Scorcese story with a crazy twisting plot with complex back story and side plots because you get none of that. It's quite evident what the movie is about from the get go. It's about the decay of peoples lives because of their drug use. The story simply follows several people on their journey from discovery to addiction to destruction. And it does it wonderfully and terrifyingly.10/10 I recommend this masterpiece to everyone",10,1,2,9 September 2013
There Will Be Blood," Masterpiece.
","For me, This movie is as near to a masterpiece as anything ever will be.Let me start off my saying that for me, this is Daniel Day Lewis' performance of his career. He is utterly magnificent. He manages to be so despicable, so horrifying, yet we still see small flickers of love coming from his character.The story follows Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day Lewis) on his journey as a young worker to the successfully terrifying wealthy oil businessman.The movie is a cinematic masterpiece. It is beautifully shot, scripted, acted, edited, the soundtrack by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood is utterly mesmerizing and hypnotic at times.The movie starts off relatively slow and tense but have patience with it and you will be rewarded with one of the best movies ever made in my opinion.10/10 Must watch.",10,5,8,9 September 2013
