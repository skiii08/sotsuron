Scarface," Pretty vacant
","Worthwhile mainly for a ton of great quotes, an easy addition to anyone's imitation repertoire, and an enjoyably brutal scene between Pacino and some coked-out Colombians, *Scarface* is an otherwise terrible film.  Every character has about the same depth as an infrequently used comic book villain.  I do not deny Al Pacino's greatness as an actor, but he is much better in a movie like *Donnie Brasco* where he gets to play an actual earthling.  Incidentally, before seeing this movie I was puzzled by Ice Cube's zoologically flawed assertion that 'a horse is a pig that don't fly straight.'  Now I see the light.",Null,0,0,12 January 2001
