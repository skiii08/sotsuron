Frost_Nixon," Nice, but not genius
","This film is of good work. it's well played, well directed and even better written. i love Zimmers score.but at the end this movie is just on of the top of this year. unlike Slumdog Millionaire or The Dark Knight, which will remain forever.i like Frank Langella. his portrait of Nixon is very well composed and emotionaly authentic. but his emotional depth can never run with Penns portrait of Harvey Milk or with Mickey Rourke, who luckily had the opportunity to play mostly himself.Martin Sheen was great, too. but as always - i don't know if it are the scripts or he himself - he is not able to give his character real depth or make it a complex, interesting character. Ron Howard made all out of this movie, that could have been done with it. that's great. but with a dark Knight or a Slumdog Millionaire you can do better. and Nolan and Boyle did!",6,2,8,12 January 2009
Alexander," Just boring!
","I've watched this movie a week ago. again. i couldn't really remember why i didn't like it after the first time. now i do.if Oliver Stone asked what i think about it, i would say: 'well, Mr. Stone, you are one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. that's for sure! and somehow i can't judge if Alexander is good or bad. i mean i love the big battle at(the end of the) the beginning. but what i know for sure is: it's boring. this movie may be made very thoughtful and with talent and whatever, but it's so god damn boring! i can't help myself, but it's just ultimately boring! and that's for sure! by the way: what's that with all this gay stuff? it doesn't make the movie worse or better (and i'm gay myself!) but what... how... where... why?' The last time i saw Alexander was the second time and definitely the last time, too!",Null,0,0,21 January 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," David Yates finally nailed it!
","At last the World of Harry Potter comes to real life. You never found this world of Wizards and Witches, the world of J.K. Rowling, as alive as in this movie. It all works out. With this movie J.K. Rowling is now responsible for a real true artwork. David Yates translates the book perfectly into a movie and he does that with a language and style which will make this movie unforgettable. It is the the perfectly balanced entertainment. Between all threats, all evil there is a lot of love and humor and the Harry Potter-stuff finally becomes the awesome adventure it always could have been. The great thing about it is, that this great adventure, this thrilling story, this wondrous and fantastic world is carried by real characters and the movie takes it's time for them. There is real drama going on.I don't know how it to watch The Deathly Hallows without knowing the books or movies before it, but I know, that this movie-part was just absolutely satisfying for me. There is no weak point, nothing to complain for me. To put it in a nutshell: David Yates' directing is marvellous, it's pure energy and pure sensitivity for drama and story.Perfect :)",9,4,9,17 November 2010
The Departed," Scorsese at his best! But what's with Gibson?
","Of course this movie is excellent. it contains everything we love on a Scorsese film.he deserves his Oscar as best director this year, but it's a shame that nobody confronts his great job with Mel Gibsons directing on APOCALYPTO.when i went out the cinema after DEPARTED i knew i've seen a great movie, but APOCALYPTO is more than just a great movie. it's a milestone in movie history and not 'just excellent Hollywood' as Scorsese's DEPARTED.so, when you talk about Scorsese's great work please don't forget Mel Gibson's work, which is remarkable, too... or in my opinion better!",10,1,2,19 December 2006
The Reader," Disturbing, Amazing!
","First i thought: what's this? now the academy feels like they have to give the Oscar to Kate Winslet for her next best movie. but this movie is not just a next best movie. Revolutionary Road perhaps could be this, but definitely not The Reader. movies like this are rare, because it not happens often that a novel adaptation is that genius. and this is special, because this story goes very deep into emotional intentions and human behavior and is beyond from every moral. the characters are written and described very honest and it is a blessing to find a actor on this planet, that is able to give such a realistic and intense portrait. and Kate Winslet really is this blessing. i was blown away by her performance and it even is not just a performance anymore. she brought Hannah Schmitz to life. she lived her character Hannah Schmitz!of course all other actors are to be mentioned. David Kross and Ralph Fiennes as well. but there is a director needed, that has the ability to get from actors so much and not every director can do this. but Steven Daldrey has proved in all his movies that he has a talent to get from actors what is more than necessary. he really does what seems impossible: he can create an intensity in this movie that usually only can be created by novels. amazing!",9,1,2,3 February 2009
