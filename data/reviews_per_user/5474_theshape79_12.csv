The Ring," Good if a little clashing in its personality.
","I was almost ready to totally fall in love with this surreal fright fest. It has a lot going for it in its cold visual style, assured performances, and a story that is already begining to be copied by lesser American Films (I do admit the fact that I make that statement in reference to a lesser American Remake of supposedly superior original) But in the last ten minutes alone a couple of things began to pop out in my mind. Take for instance the fact that they make a message about parents not truly taking part in the lives of their children. Sure this might have been a part of the Japanese film, that I must admit I have not viewed but wish to see even more after seeing this version. But its hollow and reasonably foul to a story that was so cold dark and forboding. Another thing is what I shall now call the Vanilla Sky syndrome, the fact that American remakes of small foreign films feel the need to explain everything down to the most minor of details. Sure this film left some plot points more ambiguous but it helps add to the general creepiness of the experience in my opinion. Thats truly the only quibbles I had with this otherwise solid thriller. The look is great mixing some bastardized Japanese vision with that of any David Fincher film. The use of images from the cursed video and the race to find out the meanings of those images kept me entertained. Another thing to comment on was the PG-13 rating. Unlike lesser films this sort of benefits to mood of the piece, usually showing quick gory glances of Samara's victims than sustaing a shot is interesting. All in all a good film for a season which will probably soon be flooding in a pool of crap that the horror genre is usually associated with. Now lets hope American fans can get a legitimate release of the Japanese film on DVD. I hear the director of the original is miffed that it hasn't been released yet in America.",Null,0,0,21 October 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Absolutely the most satisfying movie I've seen this year.
","Sure its not the greatest movie I've seen this year, but unlike movies I've left feeling they could have done better on, I left Monsters Inc. feeling happy. Maybe it was the charm of Boo, or Billy Crystal and John Goodman's chemistry, it just all seemed to click for me. I like the way Waznowski and Sulley disguise little boo as monster. I like the fact that monsters need screams to power their gigantic city. I love everything about the movie. It was just utterly charming.",Null,0,1,5 November 2001
The Thing," It scared the hell out me when I was a kid...
",", but then again so did the old guy from Poltergeist II. Unlike that flick though, The Thing still manages to hold up in the horror department due largely in my opinion to three things: Its gruesomely creative effects, an eerie and scary setting, and possibly its tense and involving storyline. Hell, it even made Wilfred Brimley scary. Trust me if you like old school horror films, not the overly derivative and boring stalker killing dozens upon dozens of uninteresting teenagers who seem to think sex and booze are the national pass time, pick up the DVD( Like Halloween widescreen is the only way to go to get the true effect of Carpenters film ). You probably wouldn't be disappointed.",Null,0,1,2 November 2001
Pearl Harbor," Michael Bay should not have directed this.
","Let me begin my comments on Pearl Harbor by saying this could have been a good movie if it weren't for Michael Bay. Now I have nothing against Michael Bay. I believe he is capable of directing fun, excitingly big stupid movies. But should a film detailing an infamous attack where thousands of Americans be big and stupid. No. Bay is just not the type of director that should be directing an epic picture of this scale. In my opinion Pearl Harbor could have been much more. There are scenes here that in a better directors hands could have been staged differently and perhaps more succesfully. A better director might have eliminated the cliche riddled plot, and axed the mundane storyline. He might have hired better actors or at least helped the ones he had into crafting a skilled performance. As I see it a movie detailing the attack on Pearl Harbor all the way up to the famous raid by General James Dolittle would be a very interesting movie indeed. But the problem lies with Bay and him alone. Its the way he directs. Scenes are too short that should be long. There isn't enough time to flesh out characters that are interesting, and with the fact that the three you have are about as interesting as a fly on a windowsill, thats a bad thing. Even the Japanese should be more insulted by this tripe since they are shown to be bloodthirsty war mongers who only wish to attack America so they can continue raiding China unabated. The only interesting character I found in the movie was a dog aboard one of the destroyers. This movie feels more like a three hour music video instead of an epic the size of The Longest Day, or The Godfather. If you should even be interested in the least of seeing this, be smart and do like I did; rent the DVD. That way you can at least skip to the battle scene (the only thing Bay seems able to do right) The only qualm I had with this is one bad special effects shot that shows planes that look the size of model air planes zooming by the sinking ships, and the fact that the overall feel of the scene made it feel like Independence Day, which dosen't really show any respect for an event of this magnitude.",Null,1,1,5 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Hopefully an extended DVD edition will improve upon the flaws...
","...mainly that characters took a back seat to action and special effects to the follow up. Not once in this film did I get involved with the plight of any human characters in this film unlike the first one which provided ample characterization. Its almost like every critic who said that Fellowship was too long and boring was listened to. Action was piled upon action upon action leaving scenes like Theoden crying over the grave of his recently dead son, or Wormtongue's obsession of Eoeowyn unexamined. Scenes like Legolas predicting doom at Helms Deep or the death of Haldir amongst the fallen elves had little of the impact that it should have had. Even Christopher Lee who was very effective in FOTR was given little if nothing to do in this film. The only character I had any interest in watching was the CGI Gollum who with the combination of Andy Serkis's performance, writing, and computer wizardry turned out to be the best actor in the movie. Just watch the Spiderman like scene where he argues with himself over betraying Sam and Frodo, or the one after he is captured by Faramir and try to tell me any of the characters showed that much depth. I didn't see any. If Jackson is smart he will provide a different extended cut which builds upon the characters instead of the action sequences. Well to take a breath from my complaints, I still did enjoy the film. There is a lot of good action to be had throughout the film, including the use of Warg riders of Isengard, and the eventual attack upon Helms Deep. Of special note is the use of Gimli who effectively lightened the procedings just a bit, with some injection of humor. The visuals are still spectacular, with the attack on Isengard by the Ents a standout, or of course thousands of types of Uruk-Hai and Orks that are sent from Isengard, with special mention of the towering Oliphaunts who carry giant fortresses on their backs. The camerawork by Andrew Lesnie still impresses me. While the score is good, not as great and memorable as the first one. And the acting is generally good throughout with new standouts being Bernard Hill(Still the most overlooked actor in Titanic) and a particularly slimy turn from Brad Dourif as Wormtongue. One more small complaint, is anyone else tired of seeing huge amazing action sequences intercut with the most boring scenes imaginable. I hated it in Attack of The Clones, and even more so here since they cut back and forth with the confrence of the Ents. Thats a good idea wasn't it; huge dramatic battle, then a meeting between tree, back to huge amazing battle. And did anyone else kind of laugh( even thogh I guess they did show Rohan's hopelessness against Isengard ) the scenes where young boys no younger than eleven readying for battle against the six foot tall, massively buitlt uruk-hai. Now thats an action sequence I wouldn't want to see.",Null,0,0,26 December 2002
Black Hawk Down," Provides a great reason to read the book.
","Author Mark Bowden in a recent interview said his initial reason upon writing the first draft the script for Black Hawk Down was to at least make it good enough to sell another million copies of his book, which in my opinion is one of the greatest non-fiction books on war ever written. After seeing the movie I wouldn't be suprised if he did. Black Hawk Down is a gripping intense war movie that surpasses films like The Thin Red Line, and Saving Private Ryan. It takes its time showing the battle of Mogadishu from both sides of the conflict. One of its strengths is in showing the preparations of the Adid militia in readying for the oncoming battle to the foibles of the American soldiers who thought the operation to capture two of Adids top men would be a simple operation only lasting half an hour. Every action is plotted in minute detail making the battle seem more like a chess match. Its scenes like a soldier bleeding to death from a wound in his leg to the heroic actions of two delta team snipers that end up costing them they're lives that make the film so much more than a typical war movie. These were real people and these events really happened. Unlike films like Private Ryan and Enemy at the Gates, which had largely ficional stories surrounded by true stories you can't help but be amazed at this film. If theres anything I can criticize, I think the film feels somewhat incomplete. A major concern voiced by critics is the lack of showing the motives of the Somalians which is why some have called it a racist movie. As the book took some time to give you a feel of why the Somalians would attack men sent to help them, little or no information is given in this respect. While that hurts the story, I will defend the film in the fact that not all Somalians are shown as vicious blood thirsty savages. You the viewer should make your own decisions on this subject. Another problem is that the film feels somewhat incomplete because of the addition of two scenes. It feels like it wants to show you the aftermath of the battle but instead ends it without providing any resolution to the scenes other than a post script at the end of the movie. Other than these few minor details everything else is spot on from the performances ( Australian Eric Bana is a standout as is Josh Hartnet who overcomes any stumbles he took with Pearl Harbor ) to the production itself. As I was leaving the movie, I heard a teenager ask his father what the moral of the story was. It seems he found the movie bloody and pointless. If I was the father I would have made the son read the book before asking that question. That way at least he would have had some understanding of what is one of the best films this year.",Null,0,0,22 January 2002
The Mummy Returns," Short and Sweet
","This movie sucked BIGTIME. Theres my review for all to read, and its coming from someone who enjoyed the first one. This aneurism of a movie takes away all that made the first film such a sleeper hit with me. Gone is the humorous and somewhat quick banter between that showed actors fleshing out underdeveloped characters, to be replaced with the lamest two bit overly dramatic and unrealized crap a writer can think of. Remember that body sucking fatality that the mummy used to kill victims off screen in a sort of Temple of Doom fashion; well its shown here in all its digital glory and what can I say but,No. I can't accept this as being something that shouldn't be shown. Just go back to not showing it so I can have my fun of imagining what its supposed to look like. Theres so many things wrong with this flick I thought I'd talk about to things that I liked. One was the scene involving the little boy pestering his captor by asking Are We There Yet, which went on for about a whole minute before the man was driven insane. That little bit reminded me of what was good in the first one. Another thing was the mummified Pygmies. Those things were so cool and without a doubt the most awesome things in the movie I wish I could recommend it because of them alone. But I cant. Oh and for those supporters of this so called Popcorn Flick, too much butter salt on the popcorn isn't good for you. See the truth, this film is just one long and overly drawn out headache.",Null,0,0,17 July 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Great movie, but wheres Peeve's?
","I have to say this movie utterly left me flabbergasted. Not having read J. K. Rowlings immensly popular novels, and ignoring the jeers of my friends I went to see this movie with small expectations and returned a huge fan of Harry Potter. Where to begin with what the movie does right. First off is the casting of only British actors especially in the leading roles. To me thinking of some American actor stumbling around as Potter or Granger faking a British accent would have been just terrible. Thankfully Chris Columbus who seems to be the last person I would be praising after Nine Months, decided to steer off from that Hollywood movie machine idea. And speaking of the actors, they all do a wonderful job fleshing out the characters especially the young leads. Daniel Radcliffe finds just the right note making Harry Potter a character every audience member can envy and cheer at the same time time. Emma Watson plays the feisty Hermione Granger almost exactly as she is written in the book with that little bit of tartness I think most young girls have at that age( at least my sister does anyway.) Tom Felton hits just the right note of pure arrogance and prissyness as Draco Malfoy that you just want some to stand up and slap him during the movie. And Rupert Grint has fun delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie while also becoming equally as heroic as his two counterparts when the time calls for it. As for their older counterparts, they all play to greater range than would usually be called for in a movie of this type. Richard Harris is a standout as headmaster Albus Dumbeldore and Maggie Smith shines as Minerva McGonagle. Their not acting because their grandchildren are fans of the books, their in the movie because they believe in what they are performing. Another thing to note is Hogwarts itself. Everything is set to the screen amazingly intricate detail from the great hall to some of the classrooms themselves. Of special note, one of my favorite parts from the book is also one of the best set designs in recent memory, the huge wizard's chess board under Hogwarts. I also liked the fact that they didn't point out most of the special effects (i.e. ghosts, and moving pictures.) Some of these add too the visual flair of Hogwart's while enhancing the overall setting. When they do focus on special effects some are grand and exciting like the quidditch match (WOW) while others just fail to impress like Fluffy the three headed dog. Another thing, and this is very minor mind you is the exclusion of Peeves the poltergeist. As I found him to be one of the funner characters I wish they could have added him somewhere in the movie. Perhaps in one of the scenes involving Harry and his friends sneaking around the school at night while being followed by Mr. Filch the schools caretaker, he could have popped up. Maybe? Anyway thats just a small complaint to an otherwise terrific film. Sure its long, but trust me its well worth the price of the ticket. Take the kids, they might have as much fun as you will watching it.",10,0,0,26 November 2001
Enemy at the Gates," An exciting if slightly flawed WWII Thriller. Spoilers Involved.
","Enemy at the Gates proves to be one of the most exciting war films I have ever seen for the fact that it dosen't really focus on the battle of two armies, but of two men who hunt each other down in the bombed out ruins of Stalingrad. The cast throughout is excellent with special mention two the duelists Jude Law, and the great Ed Harris( who was robbed of an award for his performance in Pollock). James Horner provides a rich musical score while William Frassie photographs what I think should be some of the most beautiful images captured on film this year. Also mention should go to Wolf Kroeger who provides a stunning backdrop for the story with his great production design. One of the most amazing things about the movie to me was the fact thats it's focus was centered on the Russians vs. the Germans, something that we rarely see coming from an American film with this caliber of talent involved. But then again its the story of the sniper duel that maintains the focus, and thats where the bulk of the entertainment lies since most other aspects of the battle seem to be a moot point for the filmmakers which also brings the production down a little for major plot point of the film.Director Annaud tightly raps the audiences attention on the duel ingenuiously heightening the suppense at all the right moments. Of note is a point of film where hiding Russian snipers have blindly walked into the first trap set by German sniper Konning. The trap may be escaped, but time is running out for a flight of bombers have just started a bombing run that appears to be headed straight for them. Another good point leaves Russian sniper Zaitsev stranded in open ground hiding behind a stove, all the while his image is reflected on shards of broken glass for the German sniper to see. Its all very exciting for the film and unfortunately very fictional as I found out after reading William Craig's book. Throughout director Annaud and Goddard make use of several historical facts from the book that are used as mere details. Two details in particular hurt the film. One is the afformentioned romantic triangle. There was romance between Vassili and Tania in real life that could have easily been fitted in the film but the inclusion of Danilov whom also falls in love with Tania is a mistake. It drags part of the story down and feels contrived especially since according to the book he was only a witness to the duel.Another problem, which was a major one for me was the execution of the boy, Sascha by Major. Koning. As described in Craig's novel, Sascha was a fifteen year old cobbler who was hanged in front of his parents for spying upon the Germans. This is something I find serious not to be toyed with lightly. In the film however it comes near the end that Koning uses the boy then hangs him to draw Vassili out into the open, when he discovers the boy trying to alert Vassili of the Germans plan. This doesn't seem right to me. It also hurts the character of Major Koning who throughout the film seems a noble assassin sent to a task that must be done. After he kills the boy he becomes a monster. It just dosen't fit in with the whole of the movie. Still it is an exciting thriller that should not be missed by war movie fans or for that matter suspense thriller fans. Just don't count on it as a good record of the history of one of the most bloody battles of WWII.",Null,0,1,16 August 2001
Signs," Not really scary, but better than some suggest.
","I can't really understand why people seem to think this movie was so scary. Yeah theres an intensity to certain scenes, and some scenes have a certain atmosphere that adds to the intensity, but all in all theres nothing really jump out of my seat scary. Alien hands all of the sudden popping out from behind grates and underneath doors aren't scary. Dogs barking aren't scary. The only thing mildly scary (meaning that again something adds to a creepy atmosphere) are the aliens speaking. Besides the fact that the movie wasn't scary, I found most of it so well made it held my attention throughout. I liked the little facts that the writer/director shows us about the family and the affects tragedy that they have suffered from affecting them through the movie. I liked Mel Gibson, a stoic tough guy actor in American movies, reluctance to use profanity to scare off prowlers in the night. I like the adults interaction with the children. And the little things the kids do that make them fun to watch. And I especially like the fact that this is an alien invasion movie seen from one perspective, not some Hollywood sized Independence Day style epic with multiple big names phoning in performances whilst doing battle with aliens in what can only be described as scenes that wish they could be from Star Wars. Thats an interesting side to the story that intrigued me, even though it adds to a possible plot hole in the storyline. Throughout the movie there are no scenes of ruined desicated cities are huge alien armies. The only time we really know the aliens are attacking is when they surround the house and we can hear them instead of seeing them. That scene in particular is one the more intense scenes that the film can muster, and truly involve me as a viewer. One more note though, is the fact of faith in the movie. I know its interesting to have someone examining his faith during a time as portrayed, but doe it have to reach the level of sermonizing that it reaches in this particular film. When these scenes occur it really drags down the proccedings and puts a damper on the fun of the film.",7,0,2,11 January 2003
Ran," True Greatness. An film of great and terrible beauty.
","What more can be said about Ran than that it is, in my honest opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made. Don't get me wrong, this isn't Kurosawa's greatest film( that still goes to Derzu Uzala ), but its an amazing epic that I'd watch with gusto over skipping past all the Gladiator's or Bravehearts you threw at me. Kurosawa directed an epic thats not only stunning but viscerally entertaining and elegantly sad. Scenes like the attack on Hideotora, the opening credits with its shots of warriors sitting quietly atop horses, or the final scene involving Lady Kaede achieve an almost operatic grandeur that shows the work of one of cinemas true craftsmen. GO OUT AND FIND THIS FILM NOW!!!!!! If you really love film you won't be disappointed.",10,1,3,14 May 2001
Gangs of New York," One little thing keeps the movie from greatness.
","Even after being withheld from the viewing audience for so long I was ready to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. Everything was clicking into place for the material to astound me. The costuming and cinematography were brilliant, the sets built by hand amazing, and the actors put on performances of a lifetime. The story was even involving despite the time old revenge thy family cliche. But then the movie got hit in the face by the romantic subplot. Theres nothing truthfully wrong with most of the romantic scenes in the film. There are the good scenes like Jennie nursing Amsterdam back to health after his mauling by Bill, or Amsterdams reaction to Bills little display of Knife Throwing using Jennie as his assisstant. But when the first scene started and the two began to bicker with each other, I knew exactly where this was headed; Jennie used to be Bill's girl!!! And suprise suprise Amsterdam some how becomes pigheaded in his treatment of her until one night of passionate lovemaking. To me if both of these plot points had been left out for more convential scenes of the two falling in love, the romance would have been a little less hard to swallow. As it is whenever Dicaprio and Diaz began bickering on the screen, I began to nod off in my chair.As for the rest of the movie though, Scorecesse has directed the film which should definitely be up for the running in the best picture category this year. Everything mentioned before under his watchful eye smacks of perfectionism. The history while disjointed from the great book, is noticably applied in scenes. While no review would be complete with out mentioning Daniel Day-Lewis's brilliant portrail as Bill the Butcher. If he was not nominated this year for some kind of award, then it proves every single award for film is a sham.",Null,0,0,12 January 2003
