Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indiana Jones Raiders of the lost Ark!!! Great movie!!!
","Indiana Jones and the raiders of the lost ark is one of the greatest movies ever. I saw this movie when I was only 8 years old, but watching it again a couple of weeks ago, really showed me what great movie is is. One of my favorite things about Raiders of the lost ark, is the music. Oh my god!!, John Williams was at his best for this one as well as for the other movies he scored (Star Wars, Jaws, E.T., ecc.....). Loosing the Best Picture Oscar to Chariots of Fire was really unfair. The acting was great, Harrison Ford played his part wonderfully and so did Karen Allen. I can't wait to see the new Indiana Jones movie, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull when it comes out in May. In conclusion the Indiana Jones saga is one of the best ever done, before Star Wars of course, anyway I think that this movie is one of the greatest of all time.",10,0,1,6 January 2008
Beauty and the Beast," Beauty and the Beast!!! Best Animated movie ever done!!!
","Beauty and the Beast is truly the best animated movie of all time. Tonight I watched again after 4 or 5 years and it just opened my eyes. If all of my brothers weren't watching it with me I would have cried so much. The story is incredible, but what really makes this movie so wonderful and beautiful is the music. The songs are great, especially ' Beauty and the Beast', Alan Menken did a great job on this movie( Songs and score). I'm very happy that it won 2 Oscars, and got nominated for best picture, I think it should have won. Beauty and the Beast is a movie for all ages, it will make you happy when you're child, and make you cry when you're older. In conclusion, I believe that this movie is one of the greatest ever made and I'm surprised it's not in IMDb's top 250 'cause it really should be, anyway, to all of you who still didn't get the chance to see it or thought that it was to silly and childish, believe me it's not, it's a true masterpiece. I love it!!! And I know you will. 10/10",10,9,11,7 January 2008
The Dark Knight," Awesome Movie, But what's with The Number # 1 Thing ?
","I've just got home after seeing The Dark Knight and I thought it was spectacular!!!! I've never really been a Batman fan but I've got to admit that this movie was great. The actors were all amazing Heath ledger in particular. There's just one thing that surprises me, and it's its rank on the top 250. Number 1 ?????? I mean it's a wonderful and really cool movie but is it really better than all of the movies in the top 10. Star Wars, Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction, The Godfather????? Another thing I really liked and thought was super was the soundtrack, it was perfect. Anyway I just wanted to say that this was an awesome movie and its definitely the best movie of the year so far.",10,24,121,19 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Greatest movie ever!!!
","Star Wars is probably the best movie ever made. Even tough i've seen it more than 30 times, I never get tired of watching it over and over again. Sometimes when I'm feeling down, watching Star Wars is the only thing that can really cheer me up. One of my favorite things about this movie is the music!! John Williams has done a wonderful job on this movie as well as the other ones, in fact he won an Oscar for it. I don't know how George Lucas came out with something so perfect, but I'm glad he did. The acting was great, I think Harrison Ford is one of the greatest actors of all time. In this particular film of the Star Wars trilogy I think that my favorite character is Han Solo, the cool tough guy whose best friend is a walking carpet. Alec Guiness plays wonderfully his part as Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old Jedi master who trains Luke on Tatooine. In conclusion, I would like to say that this movie has changed the world and has opened my eyes to an incredible new universe. A galaxy far far away.....",10,1,2,5 January 2008
