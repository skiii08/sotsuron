United 93," Surprising
","The movie was not what I expected at all. It was not political, religious over over-the-top in any way. I love that many FAA and military personnel played themselves. It was also a nice touch that one of the flight attendants and the captain were also United. I also appreciated that there were no 'big name' actors to take away from the story. These people all looked like the people you would see on an airplane any day of the week. All in all, a very touching but not overly dramatic portrayal. It did however remind me for a time of how angry I was right after September 11th. How soon we forget and move onto something else.",10,2,5,30 April 2006
