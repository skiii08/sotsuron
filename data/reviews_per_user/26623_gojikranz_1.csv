Alien 3," see extended cut before deciding
","I'll admit that the theatrical cut is a bit disappointing many people say it seems incomplete well that is because of major cuts the studio required to make the movie shorter. but if you watch the extended cut on the new DVD's you'll see a much fuller complete film. the thirty extra minutes allow you finally get to know some of the characters and everything makes a bit more sense. If only David Fincher would make a real directors cut and the effects were improved a bit, mainly with the matte lines around the alien in some scenes, I think I would give it a 10. But either way i still enjoy it a lot and sometimes i have felt like watching this movie over aliens, depending on how I'm feeling at the time. I think it has great acting and sets. also a good music score and great dark mood. give alien3 another shot and you wont be disappointed.jk",9,0,4,15 March 2005
