","WHAT did I just get forced to watch, WHAT died in Colin Ferrell's gut and on his upper lip, and WHAT did they do to Rachel Weisz's voice?!?!",1,3,6,10 August 2019
Hot Fuzz," Get the Oven Mitts!
","I have to say I was skeptical about watching this movie, everyone I knew that had seen it actually told me that it was a cheap rip-off of Reno nine-one-one. Which was the movie MTV show that I really loved but I had seen some really bad rip offs and I was not interested in seeing another. So here it is years later and it comes up on Netflix and I finally decide to watch it because I absolutely love Simon Pegg I've watched all of his other movies and I think he's just phenomenal! Boy what a treat! Not only were both Arthur's from the new hitchhiker's to the Galaxy and the original BBC version, but slartibartfast from the new movie was also in it! This movie is filled with amazing Easter eggs and I'm not going to give them all away for you you've got to watch it and you'll love it! This movie was exactly what I needed to pull myself up out of the dumps today! This is one of the movies that I'm sure I'll probably be quoting lines from it until the day I die LOL! So before I give away too much I'm going to sign off with a you must watch this movie look deep into my eyes you will watch this movie LOL!",10,2,3,21 March 2019
About Time," TRULY About Time I Watched This, & You Should Too!
","I've been avoiding this movie for a while. For female I hate chick flicks. I'm more of a Die Hard kind of girl. And I Netflix the icon definitely look like a chick flick. But I went ahead and pulled up the description and it sounded pretty good actually about time travel and Bill Nighy was in the cast so I figured it must be a comedy and I truly needed something to make me laugh right now. My health is failing and I have a lot of stress at home with my son graduating high school and turning 18 so I thought what the heck I'll give it a chance. And boy did I bet on the right horse!The first thing was I couldn't quiet place this ginger kid but there was something so special and magnetic about him. So I had to come to IMDb to look it up, and it was definitely an epic facepalm! How could I not know that I was sitting here watching a Gleason?!?! And not just any Gleason, but the one who made my toes curl when he played Bill Weasley in the Harry Potter franchise! And I kind of thought that the female lead looked a little familiar but she was so mousy that I didn't figure she was anybody I'd seen that I would try to store in my memory banks, But as time went by they made her look better and better and I realized it was Rachel McAdams! For goodness sakes the actress from another one of my absolute favorite movies! So this cast is full of star-studded actors and actresses now we've got that down we can move on LOL!I do not like spoilers myself when I read these so I will guarantee you that I'm not going to give you more than a trailer or what a reviewer would give you so if you're looking for that I'm really sorry I'm sure somebody else in here we'll give that to you but I want you to enjoy it and appreciate it for yourself but what I will give you is some background and enough to make you really want to watch this movie! This is about a young man who's been raised to be an absolute gentleman and that is what he is he lives on his family's beachfront property with Mom, Dad, sister, an uncle who's a little bit off his rocker that is an absolute sweetheart. One day his dad takes him aside and tells him that the men in his family can travel through time. Not forward but backwards. They can go back and change minor things not like the history of War but like what shirt they wore to work yesterday. And doing little things like that they can affect certain outcomes in their lives. He's never had a love, and one summer his sister brings up a friend, and he really really likes her. And the last day before she leaves she finally gets up the nerve to tell her. And she tells him it's too bad you waited till the last minute basically because I liked you too. So he goes back in time and tells her earlier feeling confident because of what she told him. And she tells him well why don't we see where this summer goes and you asked me on my last day. So she's giving him all kinds of mixed messages and treating him pretty awful. When she leaves so does he. He begins his career in a law firm, and immediately and awkward young man befriends him. And we find that through the years our hero helps to make this awkward young man less awkward and the awkward young man's friendship helps our hero come out of his shell. But one night they go to a restaurant where you eat in the dark. They are seated with two female friends. They actually hit it off and agreed to meet outside of the restaurant and the minute that our hero sees the woman he's been chatting with and feeding strawberry dessert to, all thoughts of his previous summer Crush are wiped from his head. She's self-conscious and can't believe that he's interested in her, but he asks for her number and she gives it to him. He goes away so happy but when he gets home he finds out that his roommate who is an old friend of his father's had his show - he's a playwright - completely Tanked because the lead male actor forgot his lines! So our hero being the complete gentleman that he is uses his time shifting abilities to go back in time 2 fix things and only finds that by making sure that that gentleman remembers his lines, the males that he's playing opposing to then forgets his lines! So he has to shift through time again and ends up holding scrip cards for that guy so he can read the script and the show ends up being a huge success! But when he goes to call Mary the girl he met, her phone number is completely gone from his phone! This is where I'm going to end it because I don't want to give anything away. I think it's important for you to watch and see what happens, obviously he's going to use this time shifting abilities to find her because he had nothing other than her phone number to go on in the fact that she loves Kate Moss. His sister and His Friends help. That's what happens when you're a good person, people want to see you happy because they love you. And in the end that's what this movie was about with love and being surrounded by good people. I seldom go away feeling really good after watching a movie. Sure I've gone away laughing from watching a movie like Ghostbusters, and I've gone away quoting a movie like Friday, and I've gone away starry-eyed from watching a movie like The Notebook, but this movie made me feel really good about life in the people that I have in my life.So I'm to my typical positive and negative section. It is on rare occasion that I ever give out a 10 star rating, and that is because it is on rare occasion that a movie actually deserves a 10 star rating! This movie suckered me in with beautiful cinematography; a moving family dynamic- you could feel the love especially when he started disparaging his mother because you could tell it was all jokingly in a loving manner; and the use of such brilliant colors! It Really just made everything pop and really brought a feeling of happiness and positivity to the good times in the film! The dynamic between our hero and our heroin was just amazing. You can tell that these two are amazing actors because you could almost testify that they were in love. The script was amazing, the acting was amazing, every single person in this did their best and you could feel it!
Now on to the negatives. And obviously there can't be too many for me to have given it a 10. And obviously the negatives can't be that negative in order to keep that 10. There is an issue with his sister that has to be overcome, and it's a pretty big, really dangerous issue. I don't think the way it was handled was handled with appropriate severity and sensitivity to the issue. There is one other thing but unlike how I could dance around the above thing I can't dance around this so I'm going to have to let it go LOL!All in all this was an absolutely amazing movie it should definitely be viewed by anyone who's looking to feel good about their day, themselves, the situation they find themselves in, or just anything in general! It's just a feel-good movie! Don't waste your time himming and hawing, it's 'About Time' to watch this movie!",10,1,1,23 May 2019
Pan's Labyrinth," SO HAPPY I decided to watch this again!
","Years ago when this movie first came out, I decided to watch it because of all the hype. But back then, I did not have subtitle capability and while I speak Spanish I do not speak Spain Spanish I speak Mexican Spanish and yes there is a difference. So it was hard to follow and get a lot out of it. And over the years my memories of the movie were tainted and that I didn't get to truly enjoy the movie because I was constantly trying to understand what people were saying because they were talking so fast and it didn't seem like there was that much enjoyable in the story line and I was so caught up in the militaristic portions of it.
But when I saw that this movie was on Netflix, I decided to give it a chance and sure enough I had the ability to use subtitles and it didn't detract that much from enjoying the story. So if you're going to watch this I truly recommend you do so with subtitles on. Otherwise you're going to go nuts trying to figure out who's who and what's going on in the story line.
This movie is a true gem if you enjoy immense cinematography and beautiful orchestration. Myself being a person who likes to delve into movies, especially anything that is fantasy and reminds me of all the books that I read growing up to escape, I liked it fully delve into a movie and if the cinematography/ locations and the proper scoring all the films Ambiance is done, you can't help but jump into the deep end and not want to leave! The acting was top-notch! These actors are just amazing and I know it had to help having Guillermo del Toro at the wheel! More on him in a minute. The person in charge of doing the period Costumes was just fantastic! The effects people in charge of not only the Faun, which we know from Greek mythology as Pan, but also the sightless monster, did an amazing job but those characters but quite honestly Pan what's my favorite! He looked every bit the part of a Druidic Faun! So everyone who worked putting this movie together was fantastic! I know the bits and pieces of the real world were very important to character motivation, but for as long as this movie was, I think I would have enjoyed more of the fantasy world and less of the military drudgery and evilness of the Captain's world.
So I've always been a huge comic book fan going back to the 80s when I first got my Chrystar comic book at a garage sale with my grandmother and I cherished it! Then I got back into it in the early 90s when the guy I've been dating for years turn me back on the comic books and what a way to go I ended up with loads of comic books! One of those being Hellboy! I'd heard that a man named Guillermo del Toro was doing a Hellboy movie and I was very concerned because a lot of these comic book movies were just awful! But then I had heard that he had done Pan's Labyrinth, and I checked that out to see what kind of chops he brings to the table. I'm in music industry executive and I deal with bands but in many ways are two different worlds are quite similar. So I wanted to see his qualifications and how good he was. Well like I said earlier it was not easy for me to watch because of all the Spanish going on but I did enjoy what I saw I was not super impressed I was kind of bored because of all the military stuff going on but I thought okay let's see where this goes. But when Hellboy came out, it was completely different from Pan's Labyrinth and it was just funny and explosively full of action and just amazing so he certainly did not let me down! But upon coming back now and watching Pan's Labyrinth again, I can see much more of Guillermo del Toro's influence in this movie, and I'm definitely not disappointed! This was definitely worth watching I recommend it highly, just make sure to turn your subtitles on!",8,0,0,27 March 2019
Burn After Reading," Just Do Yourself a Favor, & Burn It NOW!
","Alas, another stinker by Malkovich! I saw the excellent rating on here, and that Clooney & Pitt would be co - starring, so i figured I'd give it a chance! Well, I forgotten how many pompous, arrogant, people love Malkovich 's movies! In all fairness, I LOVED the Man in the Iron Mask, and Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, I think he was kept in character by better directors in those movies! Well be certainly RUINED this movie for me!Malkovich works Foote the government in this movie. He's lucky in that instead of firing him, they reassign him to a different office. Instead of questioning his superior calmly and 'with our inside voice,' he went OFF! I mean POWDER KEG! He started yelling and screaming like a petulant child! I NEVER gave my child a pacifier, but I was damned sure looking for one to throw likes a dart into HIS mouth to get him to shut the efff up!!! THEN we see him at home with his wife. She comes home from work, hew tells her what happened, she tells him what are his plans Foote money, because HER salary alone won't cut it, hew divulged that he'd taken himself on a shopping spree!!!! And he thinks his little 'hobby' is going to be enough to support them! She laughs, to bite back the tears, and she tells him there's no way it could be enough to replace his income and insurance. Through Out, she's been calm, and he's been building up a head of steam, all of a sudden, he blows up on HER!!! He tells her about the job they offered him, but he quit of his own volition, so no severance, no unemployment, NOTHING! It's all because of HIS hot head, and SHE'S the victim, but he's being as verbally abusive as any bast---! I'd had ENOUGH! Half an hour in, no Clooney or Pitt, just a bizarre, insane Malkovich - NO THANK YOU! I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE ONE BIT! AVOID!!!!",3,0,1,5 May 2019
Clash of the Titans," Aaaahhh... Wait A Minute...
","As one who's made a study of mythology and religion, I found myself cringing back HARD into my chair! And that's not to say that the Harry Hamlin movie was that much better, it's just the version I grew up with in the 80's!Were it not for the AMAZING cast - many of which you only get to see in the background *ahem Olympus* and the stunning CGI, this would be a horrid flop! This movie lost sight of all things that made the mythology an important religion. What's next? The new Bible movie in Disney land with the cast of Harry Potter? Or the Koran in Universal studios with the cast of Keenan and Kel? C'mon! Let's at LEAST be respectful of people's religion, and not try to turn it into the next Percy Jackson!!! Pfffft!",6,1,3,15 August 2019
The Fountain," EXTREMELY INTELLECTUAL, MUST be Prepared to Think, NOT Just be Entertained!
","I went into this movie with no real 'expectations' per se, as I'd never seen the ads on tv for it. In my divorce in 2013, pretty much EVERYTHING in the house 'disappeared.' Even now with a tv, we just prefer movies to the sadness and negativity of news and topic shows. I'd seen 2 of my favorite actors were in it, and decided to give it a chance! Now in all fairness, I have an IQ in the top 1% of the world, when I was younger the schools brought in Mensa to test me. You'll understand why this is important for me to tell you as we get into this next section.
This is a story of a great love between a man and a woman and the man's devotion being so deep and real that he loses track of maybe what's most important in his quest to save her life. There are two plots in this movie. Think of it as parallel dimensions. In the real world, the wife is dying of cancer and the husband is a cancer researcher. He is so committed to finding a cure that he is literally spending every waking moment at the lab and away from her.
When one starts talking about the parallel dimension, that is where things get very confusing and convoluted. I wish I had written this review right after I saw the movie. Because I am extremely disabled and I am on medication that makes me forget things. But if memory serves, in the parallel dimension it is a man and a tree. And the man so loves the tree that he's constantly with the tree and nurturing the tree but the tree bark is damaged by disease. So he starts peeling away the bark and eating it! That's just kind of sickness to me. You're in love with this tree like you would be a spouse, and it's week and the bark is dying, so you peel it off and eat it? You're going to take your Lover's flesh and eat it that's true sickness. But yeah this movie gets really confusing really fast and it was a very touching loving movie, it had me crying but half the time I didn't even understand what was going on and as I said I have a very high IQ and I love things that challenge me and make me think, but this movie Just had too many questions and the twist in the ending was just really unsatisfactory. I'm giving it a high rating because this cinematography is amazing! The actors are incredible! Literally perfect for their parts! Most of the script is really good but the parts that are bad are really bad and it resonates even in the good stuff it's sort of a disease that just stinks in in like a bad gift just keeps on giving. Definitely don't watch this movie if you are looking for something to entertain you, watch it only if you seriously want a challenge and want your brain to hurt and be stressed out. If that's the case then this is a really good movie.",8,3,5,18 March 2019
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," A Much Less Funny Scott Pilgrim vs the World
","I'm not going too in-depth on this one, because there wasn't much to cover. Im a Music Promoter, so I thought this would be right up my alley. But yikes. This had VERY little to do with play lists. It even had very little to do with the hero's band! Mainly, it's about 3 girls; one vapid moron who dated the hero and moved on to a man even more clueless than her, who she brings to the hero's concert too rub in his face, because she's just like that... then we have the drunk lightweight party girl who got drunk right away, and EVERYONE spent the ENTIRE movie chasing after HER sorry A$$ as if she was the 2nd coming! And then you have the smart, sweet, nice girl, who(typical teen flick) kisses our hero to tick off her ex, and gets a double whammy, because it enraged her friend too. No spoilers here, watch it if you're interested. I will say, the BEST part was his friends, the band mates, they had me laughing so hard! The ending was a shock to me.... that's all I can say. Good luck.",6,0,0,29 May 2019
Pineapple Express," Weed Infused Bro-mance!
","It's been awhile since I watched this movie so I figured it was time to revisit it! It doesn't matter how old you are, weed jokes are always funny! And this cast just seems to get along so well together that it seems so plausible and they have so much fun working together you can tell that you just get immersed and can't help but laugh and it can make any bad day better! James Franco, Seth Rogen, and so many more big stars are in this movie and some of them only for a moment or two, and it all just meshes so well that even now that I know that they improvised quite a few lines it even goes to show that the script was written so well that it allowed for the creative nature of the actors to shine through and make it even that much more believable! And enjoyable!So this is where I go into the positives and negatives before I spouted off too much and gave away any spoilers LOL! So for the positives, the cast was amazing! They could not have chosen a better cast! When Rosie Perez was a crooked cop, she was so completely believable but if you had told me that she was going to play a crooked cop, I would have told you you are nuts! And that's just the starters, the script that was written was just so perfect that it allowed these people to be able to step out of their comfort zone of the types of characters they normally played and become something different and make it their own! The cinematography was great, especially at the end and I'm not going to say any more about that. The writing and the script as I've already said many multiple times was completely amazeballs! I very seldom give anything over 6-7 Stars, the movie has to work hard to earn a good rating because there are very good movies out here that deserve good ratings and I don't want a mediocre movie to be given the same rating as something that was so great that it actually deserved the good rating! So for negatives, the only thing that I have is that about in the middle for about a half an hour things kind of dragged where was like come on let's get to the point. You as the viewer kind of knew what the deal was already and you are wondering why the characters were making the moves they were making because they should know what the next move should be, and you kind of get frustrated because they were acting like idiots. But eventually the movie catches up and gets back on track. And I figure if that's the only issue with the movie, they still deserve a 9 out of 10 because the rest of the movie even at the worst blows away almost every other single movie I've been watching lately! I love this movie it's always been one of my favorites, I'm sure in about another year I will probably watch it again, I just like to let a little time go in between viewing of my favorite movies because then there's a little bit of that forgetting and enjoying remembering when you see it!So to summarize, everything about this movie is incredible the only thing that's bad is a slight section for about a half an hour where it drags its feet just a little bit, but I can say with absolute certainty that Dark Angel endorses and approves of this movie! \m/ðŸ’™\m/",9,0,0,18 April 2019
The Ugly Truth," Cyrano With Blue Eyes & Blue Jeans
","I'm not a fan of 'Chick Flicks, ' and I've never been much of a fan of Gerard Butler after the scandal.... but I LOVE the sweet, fresh - faced Katherine Heigel since Grey's anatomy & the All - American Eric Winter since Days of Our Lives. So, I've been putting off watching this movie for 10 years, now I'm disabled I'm watching tons of movies on Netflix, and saw this, had I known it was a re- imagining of Cyrano De Bergerac, as Roxanne was a few decades ago, I would have watched this back when it first came out!Katherine plays the producer of a local television morning show, who's so neurotic, that any man she dates, she has her assistant do a background check on him, and ACTUALLY thinks up and prints out a list of questions for them to ask each other on their first date! She hasn't had a meaningful relationship in a long time, she hasn't even had sex in 11 months. Everything in her life is in tight, perfect order, and that's how she likes it... she's a control freak.Gerard plays Mike, the star of a local access show called 'The Ugly Truth, ' which gets picked up by her mourning show for regular episodes. This Show is aimed at men, teaching them how to pick up women and tell them what women want- however, he's got it ALL WRONG, i.e. he tells men instead of taking women on a romantic singer date, we'd prefer you take us to Jello wrestling! So, as you can guess, they butt heads!Enter Eric's Colin. Abby sees her cat outside in a tree, the limb breaks outside his window, he rescues her, gives her his number. When she gets the nerve to call him from work, Mike over hears, and interferes. Now I ABHOR spoilers, so I won't be giving any away, but know that Mike plays Cyrano, and just as with Cyrano, he learns more about himself than anything, and it backfires on him.Being someone who doesn't like 'Chick Flicks' I LOVED THIS MOVIE! And if you're reading this review, that means you're considering watching the movie, so you probably like them, and will LOVE this movie too! What are you waiting for? Pop that popcorn and chill that champagne!!!",10,0,0,31 July 2019
