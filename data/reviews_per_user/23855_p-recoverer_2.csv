Airlift," 'Airlift' is a Masterpiece, Brilliance & one of a Kind. 5/5
","As we all know by now that India carried out the Greatest Human Evacuation in History saving more than 170000 Indians with 488 flights in 59 days. An Operation such as this in itself is a Proud moment for Indians no doubt and to justify its recreation on Big Cinema is no less than a Challenge. It not only accepts the challenge but stands out on par with the best of the best Hollywood movies ever made based on true events. I can proudly say that 'Airlift' is one of the Greatest Movie I have ever seen in Hindi Cinema and it would be in my list of top 10 Movies of All Time.The scenes directed by Menon in Airlift after Iraq invaded Kuwait are as real as they can get. First 20 minutes are absolutely The Best 20 minutes you will ever see in Indian Cinema. The cinematography is one of the Best; indeed, it changes the whole dimension of Indian audience's perspectives. The movie is visually rich and enchanting, looks as though shot on a very high budget with stunning artistic works on war, invasion and Crisis.The husband and wife's relation depicted in the beginning of this movie is exactly the same as seen in many usual couples. They love each other but they do argue sarcastically every now and then which is bit irritating for the present audience.There are so many Excellent scenes in the movie that it becomes difficult to choose one. The creativeness in recreation of invaded Kuwait is purely Genius's work of Art. Salute to him as he made it look like a real event caught on documentary, Unbelievable.I was never so much inspired by any movie such as this. This is a Landmark movie in Bollwood which should only inspire the creation of many more such movies in coming years.Nimrat did her job with utmost honesty & sincerity to the character without looking for any credit for her character in the movie. Her argument with Prakash Belawadi was Fantabulous and Spontaneous.I would definitely applaud Prakash Belawadi as he was kind of smile in between on the saddest and darkest faces. Purab Kohli was brilliant in his short act. It's remarkable that these two guys made an impact in 10-15 Min's of screen time with impeccable their performances.This is Akshay Kumar's Best Movie ever and his Best Performance in his Entire Career. He has gained huge respect from me doing this movie and I am sure from many other Audiences as well. Henceforth I will always look forth to his upcoming movies as he has turned the tide in his favor by delivering better & better movies every year consistently.I never remained in a theatre till the end credits roll on, I use to walk away to avoid rush but this time my family and 3 other Indian families in theatre remained till the last credit rolls were up. (last three as I watched this movie in its third week's weekday). The Vande Mataram Chant dispensed electrifying Goosebumps all over the body and they remained till I walked out of theatre. The last song is so beautiful, sentimental and patriotic that you yearn for more even after it stops playing. A huge respect for Akshay Kumar and Raja Menon from me, simply Awesome.All in all, 'Airlift' is a Masterpiece, Brilliance & one of a Kind. 5/5",10,0,1,16 February 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers Endgame (Not a Review, Only Opinion to avoid Spoilers) - FS
","Considered as the Finale or the final chapters of the Avenger Series, it is the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is the only film of this century that has garnered such a Huge demand in domestic as well as International Markets. Fans, especially the kids and teenagers are awaiting its release with baited breathe and fortunately I was able to watch the movie couple of days earlier than the International Release.The Movie is 3 hours long but believe me it is too short to cover such as vast ensemble cast and package all their stories into it within the stipulated time. I believe that the movie should have been made into two parts. Why I feel this way? Let me explain it to you. There are certain parts of the movie where you feel they are trying to build up the story and later you realize that they just dragged it and there are other scenes in the movie where you feel it is being done hastily before we the audience could sink in the gravity of the scene or the moments resulting the emotional scenes as bland. Now why would they even consider building up the story as Avengers Infinity Wars had already set the stage for the Finale? Everyone who has watched the prequel to Endgame only wants to know how these Heroes will make things right and how emotionally they have been affected.If they had made it in two parts then every character would have shined like in Infinity War but here even the main characters fail to make an impact. There are jokes here and there but they aren't enough. There are too many unnecessary, silly scenes that only consume time and nothing else. I believe after watching the Endgame, every fan will agree that Infinity Wars is the best movie of the Franchise. If you recall Captain America - Civilian War then it reminds you of the brilliant action choreography because most of it is done in the daylight as against the dark creepy VFX settings like most of the other Superhero flicks. Even the Infinity War triumphs in the Grand Battle because everything was done in daylight. Those scenes looks real compared to the dark graphics. I was Very disappointed with the Finale 8 -10 mins of Grand Battle of Endgame, it was similar to Aquaman.My opinion may sound bit negative but its not, you will definitely enjoy the movie and there are some good moments including is a moment where you may get heartbroken, I mean literally if you are a Marvel Fan. It is one of the most heartbreaking emotional scenes ever in a Superhero Flick because of its impact. Go watch it and enjoy but go with lower expectations so that you can enjoy more.-FS",8,1,3,24 April 2019
