Casablanca," of all the gin joints in the pictures...
","Hell yeah. I'm not even sure why I put this off for so long, maybe just projecting my fear of failure onto cinema history? I can count the number of movies that lived up to their reputations on one and a half hands, I'm sure, but this is one of them. Desert played for night even at day, Bogart the beautiful and Bergman the brusque, convoluted and borderline irrelevant WWII backdrop that buoys the main action... I love movies that can blend genres and feelings seamlessly, and this one is what -- romance, noir, thriller, comedy, war movie? It plays like the flipside to any big tentpole movie about the war, like we are privy to a dimly lit, far more interesting corner of a far more boring action movie. Kind of shocked I dug it so much!",10,0,1,11 March 2015
To Be or Not to Be," that is the preoccupation
","I wasn't familiar with Jack Benny going into this movie, other than his rep that said he couldn't cross over into film. I don't really see why, I thought he was quite capable and had a command of guises and disguises that weren't dissimilar from someone like Sacha Guitry. There can also be a connection made to Preston Sturges, with all the madcappery going on that still feels just as vital today. Some of the jokes could very well be inserted into an episode of The Simpsons and viewers wouldn't bat an eyelash. I loved seeing Robert Stack show up as a dippy flingy paramour. I think what impresses me most with To Be Or Not To Be is the sense of play throughout, and not just onstage. There are matters of love, life and death that are treated most often as debonair or romantic whimsy. A farce about humanity's greatest threat. IN YOUR FACE, Hitler",8,0,2,11 March 2015
