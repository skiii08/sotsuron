Marie Antoinette," A waste of time & money
","I am posting my review of both the 1938 & 2006 version of Marie-Antoinette.After viewing the new 2006 Marie-Antoinette with Kirsten Dunst last night, I was horribly disappointed. And maybe it was because I recently saw the 1938 version with Norma Shearer. Both movies displayed Marie's wanton extravagance, however that is where the comparison's end. The historically accurate 1938 version entailed her life from her engagement of King Louis XVI to her execution. It was indeed complete in the telling of her faults, the scandalous Diamond Necklace affair, the French Revolution, the failed escape attempt and the demise of the royal family (including Thérèse de Lamballe ) by execution. None of which were included in 2006.All 2006 attempted to do was to showcase the lovely Ms. Kirsten Dunst (of which I am a huge fan).Don't waste your money to see 2006 at the theaters, don't waste your money on pay per view, or DVD rental. Maybe see it when it is free on TV.",1,10,17,17 November 2006
