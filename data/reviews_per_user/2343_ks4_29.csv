50 First Dates," Predictable, though very charming and very romantic.
","Barrymore and Sandler showed with Wedding Singer that they were a great couple with a good chemistry, this was another test to see if Wedding Singer was a loner of if these two just were great together on screen, and indeed, they are fantastic together in this movie too!Henry Roth is a local womanizer who are afraid of relationships, until he comes along what appears to be the woman of his life, Lucy, there is only one problem here, the girl of his dreams is suffering from short term memory loss, so every day when she wakes up she has forgotten about him, this means he has to make her fall in love with him day after day, however this does make complications.This is a really good movie, honestly i was glad to see that they still can make good romantic comedies in Hollywood, even though it is the a definition of a romantic comedy, it's not really as stupid as one could expect, it does have its periods where it tries to be stupid, but it's not in front and it doesn't get noticed much, actually the 'dumb' persons of the movie that could be there to annoy you, they actually work fairly good and even gave me a few laughs, though i hate dumb humour, but this movie was so loveable i guess i got into the mood.The direction isn't much, it's pretty much a standard movie, a classic one, it has all the ingredients Hollywood loves, and uses all the time, but it's very loveable, however not a cinematic masterpiece.Now what really makes this movie so good apart from the good story, is the two leading actors, Drew and Adam are just simply great together here, their chemistry is so good that all the romantic scenes goes directly to your head, and heart. I must admit i didn't think that they could do as good a job as they did in Wedding Singer, but this is actually just as good, if not even better, it's been a while since i saw that last, but this is a great performance from both. Sometimes all these romantic comedies Hollywood produces seems to be manufactured so much that you can almost feel the kliche, they all appear to be copies of each other, and most of them are blatant failures on the box office as well among normal audience, still they manage to release more of these than any other genre, however once in a while there are some that are unique, this is one of them. Even though this is a romantic comedy, it is actually in its own way rather original, well sure it has a few kliches and it is very predictable, but it has a different moral and a more intelligent angle than some of the others i thought, and besides from that it is well done. One thing i liked very much is that they weren't trying to hard on the humour, as many others in this genre does, and fails.In the later years i have thought Adam Sandler has been running around in a little room, doing only the same roles over and over again, just in a different scenario, i guess this is yet another one of those, but what is there to say, Drew makes him shine as a star. And he returns that and makes Drew shine as well.The movie works mostly because the romantic part is so good, that makes the dumb humour that are there to fade very far into the background, which makes it a loveable movie, rather than a dumb movie.8/10",8,0,0,18 April 2004
Casablanca," Truly one of the more memorable romantic movies of all time.
","CasablancaCasablanca is one of the few remaining parts of an unoccupied France, still the german are around there. Casablanca is also one of the few places where it is possible to get free of charge to American, the free country during the war. Rick's Cafe is the coolest place in town. One day a known Czech underground leader arrives with his beautiful wife, Ilsa, to whom Rick once had a short but wonderful affair in Paris. Finally! Finally, i had the chance to view one of the most famous movies in the history, Casablanca. Some may say it's a mother to all future romantic movie, and there are indeed many things in the movie that have been copied one way or the other, but that is mainly because this movie seems to have written a small manual for how to make an interesting love drama. I haven't seen many movies this old, so who am I to judge, but there is no doubt this movie has aged like a very fine wine, even today, black and white as it is, this is still a movie that will always stand as a remarkable romantic movie, maybe even the mother of all romantic movies. I can at least say that even now, so many years after, and my young age taken in consideration, this movie still has an effect on me, and it never gets boring at all, it keeps the perfect pace for all 110 minutes, which is quite outstanding.Now for those who think Casablanca is just a romantic movie, it's not, actually it has many others aspects to it. And i think that is why this movie works so well, we see other problems being taken up, perfectly they are adjusted so there are not too many of them and the romantic issue is still the main theme, but the sub problems works well. Especially i noticed how the movie always got our interest opened for something that feels kept as a secret, for example the past of both Rick and Ilsa, before they met in Paris. That single thing was never revealed until very late in the story, which for me meant that i was constantly curious to find out more throughout the movie.The movie is quite good directed, the director have found an nearly perfect pace for the movie all along, it never gets boring and manages to be entertaining and interesting all the way through, something that i think is quite amazing, the time flew by so fast I was amazed when it ended. And that is indeed a good thing, i hate it when movies have to bring up boring sequences, and it's something that for me drags down a lot in my overall opinion, but Casablanca really impressed me on that.The acting is also quite good for this movie, acting in the earlier days are usually very different than modern days. That goes for this movie too. Best was Mr. Bogart, i actually thought he did a very good job playing a cynic man, who deep within had a heart of gold, all it took for it to open was the one woman. Ingrid Bergman played a fine role too, although i disliked her false tears, they didn't look very convincing to me.To sum it all up a bit. There is no doubt this one of the greatest romantic movies of the history, and it is the work of a perfectionist, every single detail seem to be thought through, and the movie works fantastically well and has very few flaws. The movie has aged perfectly, I think one of the main reasons to this is that there are barely any use of special effects in the movie, something that is very easy to spot now a days, but this movie can be watched without problems, even now a days. If i had to point a negative side out, which I have to do naturally, the movie didn't make me cry and really feel with my heart as I was hoping for, the movie is good no doubt, but i never really fell in love with the characters. Something that i think is necesarry for a romantic movie to succed to a top grade, but there is no doubt anyway, if i get the chance, then I will watch this movie again.8/10",8,1,2,16 May 2004
Monster," Theron's Success!
","Another serial killer portrait, and even one based upon a true story, it has been seen before, but there is of course a different angle to this one.Aileen is a women who has lost all hope in life, she spends her afternoons sitting under a bridge with a gun in the hand trying to convince herself life is actually not worth living, she hates everyone, she hates men, she hates the world, there is no love in her, except her only friend, Thomas. One day in a bar she stumples across the young and insecure Selby. Selby is what Aileen was in her young life too, a lost soul. In Selby, Aileen finds love, her soul mate, her force to continue life, but things get complicated when she is forced to take care of Selby and her heart can not make her life the life she lived before Selby came along, after being raped, she kills her first victim, and her hate for men grows.Considering that this movie is based upon a true story, naturally we know the end from the start. The story doesn't bring much new to the genre, everything it as it should be, the strength of the movie is the absolutely terrific portrait of Aileen, given by Charlize Theron. What a triumph this is for Theron, her absolute breakthrough, it's almost sad that she will never be able to play a character this well again, this is near perfection, and it gives the movie all the heart and soul it has, Charlize Theron simply is Monster!Both direction and supporting roles are average of this movie, it's at times rather obvious that the director ain't the most experienced one, sometimes the storytelling slows too much down and makes for some rather boring moments, but overall it works pretty well, but again, it's mostly thank to Charlize Theron. However Christina Ricci also gives a good performance, a performance that is strongest in the start while she is very insecure, her first entrance in the movie, the scene in the bar, that's the best moment for Ricci in this movie.Basically, this movie works good because Charlize Theron gives a performance that will make the audience feel her pain, without feeling that pain, this would have been just another movie, but in the end you can really feel the anger, the confusion, the sorrow. Everything she is feeling, i can't praise her performance enough, i thought Watts should have won the oscar, but now i understand why Theron got it, she is the heart and soul of an entire movie.7/10",7,0,0,30 April 2004
12 Monkeys," Challenging and disturbing, a true masterpiece!
","James Cole is sitting in a prison in a distant future, his only change to get freed is to volunteer for a time travel test that will send him back to find the source of a virus that wiped out 5 billion people in 1996. However they send him too far, and he is arrested and send to an institute where he is defined as being insane, he makes a magic houdini escape. While being at the mental institute he meets two people that will have great effect on his 'future' life.2 days ago i saw Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas, expecting a masterpiece from what appeared to be one of the more creative minds of Hollywood, i was very disappointed, but i saw the potential in the directing. Now i see Twelve Monkeys, and i must admit, this movie was very challenging, original and extremely unpredictable, it can be analyzed in many different directions, which is what i think is the strength of a true masterpiece, a movie that can have different meanings depending on how your mind is built. 'A movie can have a different effect on you depending on when in your life you see it, and the state of your mind at the time' Something like that is said in this movie, and it defines the movie pretty well.What makes this movie so damn great is the constant twists, you will find yourself guessing all the time, at times i felt very confused, at other times i thought i had everything in place, then a twist and you're lost again, this makes the movie a constant original and unpredictable experience, and the end, which can be interpretated in a large amount of different ways, is very powerfull and mind bending, which is really fantastic, this is a movie that will be looked back at in many years as an even greater masterpiece.The directin is very firm, Terry Gilliam has his own style, which obviously includes many alternative camera angles, which gives the whole movie a feeling of being unreal and portraying a fantasy world, and i feel confident that if we asked him why he used this, there would be a deeper symbolizing meaning with them, i think they describe certain parts of the movie. This movie is a work of a true genius.This movie would not have worked without Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis, each are they giving one of their great performances of their life. Especially Brad Pitt i admite for his role as a crazy lunatic in this movie, the way he portrays this semi psychopath is just so realistic and fantastic. Bruce Willis is the counterpart, also giving a performance as a rather mentally disturbed person (That is the way i felt he got portrayed), he does an amazing and convincing job, together these are bringing the movie the energy and soul it needs.To sum it all up. They say you can talk about a true masterpiece forever, there will always be new things to discuss, there will never be anyone with a opinion and interpretation of the movie that is 100% identical, well i feel that this is one of those movies that can always be talked about, i would love to analyze this, as especially the ending is very powerfull and unique. But also the entire movie itself, there are many things that a lot will feel differently and understand differerently. Everyone will of course understand the movie the same way, but the deeper meaning of the movie, and the actual effect of the twist, that is what makes this movie so strong.9/10",8,0,0,9 May 2004
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Quite enjoyable..
","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance KidButch Cassidy's gang is known in the whole west, they have a wide reputation for their robbings. As the time passes the law will no longer stand back and watch them rob everything, a special team is financed by one of their often victims, and the hunt starts.This is quite an enjoyable movie, and it has aged very well, actually there aren't many things that points out that it might be an older movie. If i had to point at something it is the different style they made movies back then and the less clear picture, but that is okay, becuase it gives a dusty feeling, which is good in this case because it is a western. The movie is also very beautifully photographed with many silent and beautiful images of the west, something that is a must-have for a western. But even though this is quite a good movie, there are still some flaws. One of them i think is that the movie is a bit long, i actually didn't get bored, but i still felt that some of the scenes are a bit too long, especially the first part of the movie, which somehow actually manages to last an whole hour. Also there aren't many action scenes, which is something i love about westerns, this movie seems to avoid them to focus more on the friendship of Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy, and also we see them robbing almost a million banks.Robert Redford and Paul Newman is a fantastic couple on screen, i loved them both together here, their chemistry is very good, and is very important as their relationship is the main essence of the movie. Robert Redford is the mr cool as Sundance Kid, while Paul Newman is the smart and clever Butch Cassidy, who ain't much of a killer though, together they work very well.To sum it all up a bit, my honest opinion is that this movie is quite enjoyable and i feel confident that i will watch it again some day, it's not the best movie i have seen, but it works well and i didn't find myself waiting for it to end. I could have wished for some more action and some scenes cut down shurter, but i was actually positively surprised how well this movie has aged.7/10",7,1,4,8 May 2004
Alien," Groundbreaking psychological sci-fi terror!
","Seeing this movie now in 2004, is a bit funny, first of all many of the scenes in the movie has become somewhat a cliche, and this has obviously been ia inspiration for many movies to come after. But obviously this is one of the milestones in the cinematic history, even though it is from 1979 it is still a fantastic and stunning movie, both visually and psychological, as i wrote on topic. There are many good points of this movie, first of all the script is absolutely great, gripping, original and controversial, full of different twists, some more obvious than others, one of the best scenes of the movie is the one where Ash turns out to be a computer, and the following interviewing scene, a scene that can definitely come up for debate of our curiosity for finding foreign and unknown organisms to explore, are we perhaps too curious and eager? Not something i'm gonna discuss with myself here, but it's an obvious opinion there, and something Ridley Scott may be very interested in exploring more, which he has done already with Blade Runner i guess. Another strong side, and again, praise to Ridley Scott, the direction of this movie is nearly perfect, i can't find any spots to put my fingers on and criticise, all i can say is that he did a fantastic job creating a atmosphere that stuck to your back, again, some things here have been copied and thus seen before, but it is still one of the best direction i have seen ever, the work with the flickering lights, the many aspects of the image, the, at times, alternative and experimental use of the camera, there are so many good aspects of that, and this movie could have been a lot worse without Ridley in the lead. The special effects really is the only point that annoyed me a tad, but considering the movie is 1979 and we are now in 2004, i don't think it's something i wanna get into, the monster so to speak wasn't viewed a lot of times, which added to the psychological part of the movie i think, the many silent scenes where you follow the characters is the real backbone of the movie, not the monster, which is good i think, horror movies shouldn't always be focused on what the eye can see, but maybe rather than on what the eye can not see. 9/10",9,0,1,13 March 2004
The Godfather: Part II," Al Pacino shines above all.. again!
","The Godfather was great, maybe one of the best movies in cinematic history, and part 2 doesn't fail, more the other way.. another great movie and especially i think Al Pacino shines again..The Godfather continues, of course now the focus is how Mike Corleone (pacino) rules the corleone family, but also this story goes back and show Vito Corleone as young (magnificent Robert De Niro), ti's very interesting and should be one of the greatest sequals ever.",9,0,1,25 December 2002
The Thing," Thrilling and intelligent, though some loose ends and missing explanations.
","Carpenter is one of a king when it comes to movies, he does his thing here with some well done directing that really grabs to your back and hangs on, the silent scenes of the long halls only supported by gothic and mysterious music are definetely the best side of this movie, silence can scare.The movie follows a group stationed at a research facility in the antharctica (Spelled correctly? Probably not :), one day two men arrives in a helicopter apparently hunting a dog, they appear crazy and are shooting at the dog without thinking, after hitting one of the men of the facility they shoot the strangers. After going through the information gained from their corpses they travel to their camp and discovers it more or less ruin and burned out, returning to their home they put the strange dog into the kennel where it kills the other dogs and turns out as a monster, an investigation is set upon and the dead dog is investigated, it shows that the dog was controlled by an organism able to imitate other organisms to create a perfect copy, from here, the movie begins.Carpenter showed with Halloween already that his is one hell of a horror director, his strength is that he goes for psychological horror mixes only by a little gore, i hate the gore part of horror movies as it often appears un interesting and in the long run just plain boring, but Carpenter does this differently, he doesn't show to much of it, but still a little to disgust us, his unique style, that has however been copied a few times, is shown very pure here, with the many silent runs through the slim corridors, down creepy halls, with the classic horror music pumping through your vanes.The acting is pretty good, i wouldn't say that there are any of these that does a terrific job, i didn't feel that way at least, there are many main characters, which makes it a little confusing and also hard for one individual to stand out, even if Kurt Russell has the main part, they're all a bit above average but all fades a little to the background as there are so many different persons to focus at.Even though this is without a doubt one of the classic and memorable psychological terror movies, there is no doubt that it is flawed as well as beautiful, there are several loose ends and just generally things that i felt could have been explained better, in the start of the movie it paces very fast through the start of the movie, where i would have preferred a slower introduction that explained better what was really going on, but later on the story sums up rather nicely and does create a rather thrilling and entertaining movie.7/10",7,0,1,23 April 2004
Edward Scissorhands," A fairytale so unique and beautiful i wanted to grab a kleenex!
","Well was nice to see a good fantasy and fairytale alike movie, going into this movie i really expected it to be good, and it was, it filled my expectations, except, i couldn't press that one tear which i wanted so bad, because this movie is really special, it has so much warmth and it's such an amazingly beautiful portrait of uncommon man with a big heart.Many things works in this movie, it's well directed, and the sound side is really good at creating the atmosphere needed for each scene, but what keeps the movie alive is Depp's magnificent (YES MAGNIFICENT) acting in the role of Edward, i'm really coming to think that Depp is one our of generations absolutely finest actors, and in this movie you can't really avoid getting to love him, he just creates such a loveable character.Visually the movie was also extremely well done, and it was an interesting almost humourous portrait of an american suburban, it reminded me a bit of Beauty and the beast, also a well done movie in the same genre, but man i am gonna watch this movie again, becuase i really think it was such an amazing story.I don't really know how to comment further on this movie, but i think it was absolutely stunning and everyone with an open mind and interest in fantasy movies should take a look at it, it was indeed a gribbing and well told movie, a masterpiece for it's genre in my eyes, and i recommend everybody to at least give it a chance, even though it's not your ordinary story, but then again i found the un-ordinary part of the plot interesting going into it, well done movie.9/10",8,0,0,15 March 2004
Aliens," Solid action all the way through, and god damn a superb ending!!
","What the first one lacks, the 2nd one got, what the 2nd one lacks, the 1st one got.. That's how to sum it up really.While Alien 1 was a psychological ride, this movie is plain action, and with James Cameron in the lead it's pretty damn good action.I've heard many say this is the best action movie ever, and i partly agree, but i still think Terminator 2 is better, and also some newer movies are very impressive generally due to the development within special effects, but no doubt, this is a thrill ride, and it's very experimental with camera work, and the effects are actually pretty well made, and the 'monster' looks way more convincing than the 1st one, although they show to much of it here, it looks good, but not THAT good, they should have shown it less and also that way perhaps build more on the psychological part of like the 1st one. 'The most frightning thing is what the eye can not see'.
Now as the topic says the ending of this movie is great, and hell yeh, the last 1/3 of the movie it's just to lean back and get on the ride, because from here there is no stopping, one of the best endings for this genre i have ever seen, and may i mention the best scene is when the girl and Ripley is stuck inside this room, where there are two, what appears to be, giant spiders, they were pretty creepy.Final i think this movie is definitely one of those to remember everytime you go into an action movie, you don't see a lot of action movies that works as well as this one, even now almost 20 years later it's still as good as the ones coming out today, the acting was a bit so-so, but that isn't the essence of this movie anyway, it's basically just a action ride from start to end, with a damn good storyline.9/10",9,0,0,14 March 2004
Resident Evil," Action packed and interesting, but far from scary.
","Resident EvilA deadly virus escapes in a top secret research facility based underground, a team of top trained soldiers/agents are send to find out what happened down there.In the latter years it has become very popular to make movies out of popular computer games, and they often fail for some reason, i think maybe it's because there is a big difference from experiencing the story from computer games through movies, movies tells you a story, in games you act yourself as the investigator. However, this movie has a very interesting and much of the way pretty original and unpredictable storyline, even though it is probably stolen from the game, i never played the game, so i can not tell.
In the start i found the movie very confusing i must admit, not much made sense, but as the movie discovers most of the question marks are explained, although i am still wondering about a few things, but they are not so much related to the question marks, they are most related to the realism of the story. But i guess this is okay for a fantasy movie. Without giving too much spoilers one of the things i don't understand is why a team of soldiers are send into a research facility without wearing any kind of protection, couldn't it be possible there would be something in the air? Also if the AI protecting the Hive is still online, why can't they reach it that way and find the answers that way? Rather than sending a team down to discover the secret. However, if you look away from all these small flaws, the movie is actually very entertaining and driven, it is a very interesting story, though it has a lot more potential than used, but using the full potential might also remove much of the action. But maybe i am just one that prefers a deep storyline, especially about something that i find as interesting as this, i'd like a deeper look on the whole idea.But there is never any doubt, this movie wants the action part in focus, and that it does well, this is far from a horror movie, and it's not spooky or scary at all, it's a driven action movie with a lot effects, but that is entertaining enough, just don't go into the movie expecting pure horror.Paul Anderson has been put in charge of Alien Vs. Predator too, and if he can produce an interesting action movie like this one, then i am looking very much forward to it, because he has done an okay job to combine the storyline with the amount of action that is expected from his side, my personal preferences hopes for a deeper storyline in Resident Evil: Nemesis though.The acting is okay, there are many main characters, and we never learn much about either of them, only 3 persons we get background information on. Generally because they each have their own reasons to be there, none of them really shines through though, except one. I think Milla Jovovich has proven to the world now that she has quite some talent, which is good, this movie is very action driven and doesn't put her acting much in focus, but i'm looking forward to seeing her in the future, because i think she has her moments in this movie.To sum it all up a bit i found this movie rather good, it has some flaws which puts it down a little, but generally it's a good driven action movie that is worth watching if you're into this kind of movies. It's not a horror movie, so don't expect that, expect a solid action movie wrapped within an interesting storyline and you will be happy.7/10",7,0,0,2 May 2004
Remember the Titans," A winner film!
","A movie that has the american dream written all over, but it works anyway, and it shows what is the best thing about us, it's a strong movie, and it's gonna make you drop a lil tear, unless you're ice cold, but it sure is a winner movie and it shows how winner mentality can unite people, even in times where racism rules america.And Denzel Washington, who i think we can conclude is the most unique characteristic actor in many years, he does a great job here as well, it's not as good as in Malcolm X, but that's ok, becuase that was as near to perfect as it can get, but he does a damn fine job here as well.I generally think it's a pleasant movie, it has a morale, but it's more a description of what went on, the morale is the history, and i think it's good to see that people can unite even when everything and all odds are against them, it's a blast to see them unite, the movie really takes a turn, and i can not imagine how it must have been to live in such a racism environment, but i think it's wonderfull to watch how the players on the team slowly unite with each other to form the team and actually find out that they have common interests, there will always be made movies about the former racism in america, but there are some we should never forget, remember the titans!7/10",7,0,1,20 February 2004
Hellboy," Good popcorn movie, but that's about it.
","HellBoyThe story about a demon, brought back to hell to serve the evil, but ended up serving the good. Approx 60 years after HellBoy was brought back, the former evil mastermind, Rasputin, returns once again to bring doom over the earth, only one man can stop him, Hellboy.Over the lasts years the new hype are superhero comic book adaptions to the screen, some of these have failed, some have been very good like X-Men 1/2 and Spider-Man 1/2. Here comes HellBoy, and obviously the expectations are high, and I got to admit, the movie fell through for me, I'm not saying it was the worst one ever, but it never really got to me, a true popcorn movie, 2 hours to unlock the brain and watch the screen.I'm not going to lie, I prefer movies that takes some brain work, some deep movies where you can really get under the skin of the persons, of figure out the plot. This movie succeeds in neither, it's both a bit hollow, and the characters - except a few moments with Hellboy - feels pretty empty, furthermore the attempt to bring personal situations to the superhero world of Hellboy fails badly, the chemistry between HellBoy and 'Liz' (Starring Selma Blair) works not too well, and generally I just thought that Selma Blair felt very miscast in this role. This movie is generally what I would categorize as a 'Popcorn' flick, not to much brain work, but a lot of action and very often use of CGI and other similar effects, this at times feels a little like an effect war, even though much of it is well done, I can't help myself thinking that it's all effects, one of the things I liked was how obvious it was that a person was playing 'Blue', instead of that being a CGI character.The direction of the movie is okay, the action scenes are smoothly done, even though I hate the classic element of 'A beats B, B beats A, A beats B, B beats A, A beats B and win.', That element is often used here, and it's kind of sad, it feels like the movie drags out a bit, it could have used the sparetime by personalizing more with the characters, anyway the action scenes are easy to follow and not confusing, well done and pretty entertaining, especially since they destroy everything around them, and I did find myself cheer for HellBoy, even though I knew he was gonna win anyway eventually. The future sight of 'The Apocalypse' were the best 10 seconds of the film, a powerful sight, that may one day be even more realistic with the nuclear weapons etc. man possesses today, perhaps a hidden message here? Especially the sight of the newspaper were well done.Sadly I think the director avoids the downsides of being a hero and all that, a downside that X-Men and Spider-Men portrays so well. There are a few moments of the film where the director tries to point it out, an example is the awkward scene between HellBoy and Liz in his room where he tells her that he wishes he could get rid of his looks and be normal, but he can't, a good promising moment there, but after that, it fades into the background and is not taken up again, unfortunately.There is no doubt that Ron Perlman is the powerful Hellboy, also a terrific performance for him, and his good humour fits the character well, all the other characters and actors in the movie falls through swiftly, some are average performances, like Rupert Evans as the FBI agent, not a bad performance, but perhaps not really many chances for him to show some good sides. As mentioned I found Selma Blair pretty poor in this role, and well that generally went for much of the cast, even though I must admit the FBI chief I hated, but in the end he got portrayed as a pathetic character suddenly socializing with HellBoy, not too well done.Overall: A true popcorn movie, nothing less, nothing more, it had more potential, but fails to take use of it. If you feel like unlocking your brain for 2 hours, HellBoy won't let you down.5/10",5,0,1,2 July 2004
School of Rock," Transformation! ROCK ON!

","This is a very special movie, it's a very original movie i think, movies like these aren't often seen in the modern world, but it's great how well this movie works, Luhrmann have really done a good job.The music works perfect with the scenes, and it creates the spark that makes you feel with the characters, especially loved the scene with song 'One day i'll fly away', i couldn't help putting on a little smile there realizing how fantastic Kidman is in this movie, how can you not fall in love with her?Kidman and McGregor had an absolutely stunning chemistry which worked great with an awkvard way of editing, which i liked though, the movie itself is a very artistic piece and Luhrmann have a very special way of doing his movies, it works fantasticly here though, way better than Romeo And Juliet, and the cinematography is absolutely stunning as well.. Overall a great movie i think 9/10, watch it, it's worth it!-ks",9,1,2,5 February 2004
Donnie Brasco," Good and realistic. Depp and Pacino shines.
","Donnie BrascoJoe Pistone is an undercover agent for the FBI, his code name is 'Donnie Brasco', Joe manages to hook up with a small time who vouches him into the mafia, while he's doing his work he is building a solid relationship with 'Lefty', the guy who vouced him. While he is working he sees the life of the mafia take him over while his 'real life' with his wife falls apart.This movie in it's style is very intelligent, it describes something that has been seen before, but in a different angle, which i think is good. It's a very realistic movie that gives a good portrait of how the mafia works. But most importantly for the movie is the new angle of the whole mob environment, because we all know pretty much how this works now, through so many legengady movies, from Godfather to Casino. While most of the other movies gives a detailed portrait of the rise and fall, this movie focuses one two thing for two different character, in Pacino's case we see the constant struggle for rising in the grades. In Depp's case we see a great detailed portrait of life as an undercover agent, and what problems it brings, also on the home front.Depp and Pacino works really good together, and i'm gonna be honest, i'm a big fan of Depp, and he does indeed once again show me why, this man is so talented, and the way he absorbs his character and gives them a bit of himself is really amazing, he once again does an amazing job here. Pacino is playing his perfect role, the mob, how many times has he done this sort of role now? I think it's many times, but he works very well in them, his whole attitude just makes him seem like a very realistic mob guy.The directing in the movie is basically a standard job, i think many could have done a better job, the direction doesn't feel very deep, there aren't really any things there are noticed. Something i think makes a great director is when you can watch the movie and spot who made it because he uses personal phrases in it. This could have been directed by anybody, it's the acting that kicks this movie alive, together with a good storyline.For a sum up, i must say i liked this movie a lot, maybe i liked it better because i found the particular subject interesting, but either way. It is a good movie, and it is well done, especially the brilliant cast brings good light to a good story. A story that shows a different angle of the mob side, in a very brilliant way. It's a movie to remember.8/10",8,0,0,6 May 2004
8 Mile," Great film!
","First off, to those who doesn't like Eminem, his acting in this movie is really really good, he definetely deserves to be nomitated for this performance.I saw this last evening with smoe friends in the cinema, and i have really been looking forward to it, and it definetely did not dissapoint me! The final battles definetely, but also the movie gives a good view on how rough life is when you're living in the trailerpark and every day is really just another day of trying to get by.. Also i like the way it's directed and the various looks on detroit's trailer park clash..The best part of the movie is the battles, definetely.. But the story line is good to.. this movie have to be seen!-ks",9,0,0,19 January 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Who can deny Tarantino's greatness?
","Kill Bill Vol. 1 is in many ways groundbreaking, experimental, it may not be the best movie i have seen in my life, but it is one of those that will be rememberred in 20 years for it's poetic and unique style. I admire Tarantino for his courage to experiment with the art of movie making and how he always tries to be original and somehow always manages to succed, even in a movie like this which has been build upon stealings from old movies, and they are obvious at times, but they are great, and the sarcastic look he gives on violence, it's all fantastic, he steps on grounds where not many others dare to step and always gets a unique result.
This movie has a lot of Tarantino touches, and honestly no one else than him could have made a good movie out of this storyline, his use of sound is, like before, outstanding, the soundtrack of the movie got a big part of the way he makes the blood and violence look poetic, yet realistic in a way.Now i must admit i think Volume 2 will be better, this movie spend a lot of time working the story up, and i now understand why QT decided to do it in 2 parts, else it would have been too long, this way it actually works pretty well..Now you can't watch a movie without having to put your finger down somewhere, and in this case i must say i think the movie wasn't as Adrenaline driven as expected, but then again i wouldn't directly say that is bad, because i think the fighting scenes was well stopped, i hate it when they overdo the fighting scenes and they become doll in the long run (Matrix Revolutions!), this way he managed to end everything up pretty nicely. Although i saw Zatoichi last week and the fighting sequences there was better done, but that's not Kill Bill's fault i guess, they are unique in their own way, one thing i found beautiful in and obscure way was the overdone 'wooooosh', obviously inspired by crappy b-movies where these sounds are all over, but they are so exagerated in this movie that you are gonna end up loving them, a thing that only Tarantino could have done convincing.Praising Tarantino all the time now for his genius, i gotta comment on the acting too, i think Uma Thurman is brilliant in this role, it fits her fine, this sporty, cold and driven killer. As for the others i don't think there is much to say, i liked the bodyguard for Lucy Liu, the little innocent teen girl with the big nose, but other than that i think they were just pretty average, Uma Thurman is the one that shines through, if anybody. The strong side of this movie is really the scenery, sound and directing, that's what i think.9/10",8,0,1,23 March 2004
The Last Samurai," A fantastic movie that combines all the best elements of movie making!
","People say this is a Dances Will Wolves copy, what is that about, the movie is obviously inspired by it, but from there the movie is different, even though it draws references to en earlier masterpiece, how is it that wrong, i do not see, there are many movies that has been inspired by story lines from earlier movies and still been good, well never the less, this one is just as good as its inspiration, if not better.Tom Cruise in the movie play a morally troubled man who is troubled by earlier times, he has become a drunk living with his past on his heart, he is then sent to Japan to train the Emperor's army to fight against the last Samurais, the pressure from above forces them into a battle they are not ready for, the weak army leaves Cruise stranded and he is captured because the leader of the Samurai, Katsamuto (Watanobe) wants to learn about his enemy. From there the movie pretty much talks for itself, the movie has a lot of difference great moments, moments of humour, moments of romance (without sex involved, i'm amazed, a hollywood movie without sex scenes), and moments of drama.I was very stunned by this movie, in my opinion it posseses everything a good movie should have, it have drama, romance, moral and action. It's a classic well constructed epic a like movie, and i love epic, honestly, pretty much written after the classic style, but it's so damn nicely directed, clever directing supported by beautiful and engaging Cinematography and a, at times, dramatic, at other times, silent yet beautiful soundtrack.As for the acting, it's well done too, Cruise and Watanobe is doing an amazing job, and another thing i like is that they are true to the language of the natives, they are realistic, talking japanese, combined by english, that also makes for some funny scenes that can make you smile a bit on top of the tragetic layout the movie has, Cruise is actually talking japanese well, i was so surprised, i liked him before as an actor, but now he has showed me and the whole world that he is also a good characteristic actor, maybe his actor is not to many years away.Also i found that the movie had a lot of nice, and for once, obvious symbolic values, the movie was faithfull to the way it portrayed the samurais, as people who puts honor and discipline at a high status, especially honor was well displayed when the Samurai with the long hair (Don't remember his name), who gave Cruise a hard time in the start, got shot, when the other Samurai's wants to help him on his feets, he pushes them away and stands up for himself, i don't know what it was about this scene that was so engaging, but i just simply thought it was great, one of the characters who you maybe disliked a little because he was such a cruel guy, you suddenly have sympathy for.I was constantly thinking that this movie had to be like Master And Commander (Which i gave 7 and found a tad confusing and meaningless), but but after watching this i was stunned and had no idea how i would describe it, i barely ever give 10 to a movie, but i think this one deserves it, even though it has taken a bit of critism from reviewers and other movie goers, i can't deny what i think is the proper solution hehe, stunning movie.10/10",9,1,2,27 March 2004
A Clockwork Orange," Good movie, but too complex for this type of movie.
","They say Stanley Kubrick has always been ahead of his time, and considering the age of this movie, that is probably true, this is a very a sharp critical movie, still it contains a high amount of social realism though, it's a twisted movie that is very hard to sit through, but leaves you thinking.Alexander De Large and his gang is a product of a numb society, for fun they entertain themself with violent acts towards whomever crosses their way, Alex is the leader of the gang, the others go in his path and does what he wants, one day though two of them objects and wants to be equal, Alex doesn't agree and starts a fight, after that things go back to normal, Alex in charge, but his gang is no longer his friends. He is betrayed and is sent to a prison, to get out early he volunteers for a program that is supposed to help him out of his violent path.Kubrick has always had a very experimental style, and even though this mvoie is hard to watch, it's still very powerfull and have a very realistic (even though the movie itself is portrayed unrealistic and fantasy alike). The movie spends a lot of time on the act of violence, and Kubrick's morale point of view is never in doubt, but then again, it always appears to be in doubt, because i dont think that i ever managed to figure out completely what the meaning was with the plot, just as i thought i was on a straight path, understanding everything, the movie turns and goes in the opposite direction, it's definetely a complex movie, that for full understanding has to be watched more than once, problem also is that it's hard to sit through, Kubrick uses the soundtrack perfectly, especially in the start, Beethoven is nearly constantly playing, but as soon as Alex is arrested, it stops. And from here it only plays occasionally as he gets cured, but in the end the path comes back to hunt him, together with the music.Of course this is Kubrick's movie, his directing habits shines through in all his movies, because he is a genius, and a true master, this movie is very powerfull, but i think also maybe too complex. Kubrick has his own style and his own way of saying it, i think not all will understand this movie, but the ones that do will think it's a masterpiece, this movie will divide the audience, some will understand it and think it's brilliant, another large group will think it's jibberish, and then there'll be the ones still trying to figure out how all the puzzles fits together, the movie is very symbolic, colors and music displays a lot of the meaning of the movie. In one remarkable scene in the start we see Alex and his gang attacking an elderly man sitting in a tunnel, as Alex and his gangs walks in their shadows grow long down towards the old homeless man, i think this specific scene tells a lot about what the initiave with the movie is, it's a symbolic movie. Which is also one of the reasons why i believe it has to be watched more than once for full understanding.
Another thing that is interesting in this movie is the special use of the language, it's obvious that Kubrick was thinking in a futuristic style while taping the movie, the language is unique and gives the movie a weird touch, though interesting, the movie is very experimental as other Kubrick movies, it does seem like he is trying to look into the future and predict the future of a numb society.Malcolm McDowell is Alexander De Large, and he fills out this complex and interesting character very well, he is the only of the chracters that shines through, all the others pretty much fades to the background, perhaps because the story doesn't stop at them long, there are many supporting characters playing various roles and they all appear in different parts of the movie for a little while.The movies strength is definetely the directing and storyline, Kubrick dared to check chances, a movie like this nobody else could have made at this time, he is unique and that's what shines through in this movie, this experimental director has created a movie that will and should never be forgotten, because it's a landmark in cinematic history. However, to me it doesn't stand as the masterpiece of all time, mainly becuase it's too complex, and at times too long, but the complicated way it's directed is what makes it hard to understand, so for me it's both a strength and a weakness, strength because it's unique and original and it will stay in your thoughts for a good while, weak because it's very hard to absorbe and understand, and it's almost definate that it has to be watched more than once for full understanding, something that isn't always a good thing, especially considering that it isn't an easy movie to sit through.7/10",7,1,2,30 April 2004
Enemy at the Gates," Very intense, but typical Hollywood script.
","A really intense and outstanding movie, sadly it has Hollywood written all over it, you are never in doubt of the ending and it all the way through feels sort of predictable, which removes a bit of the intensity, though not all.Vassili Zaitsev is a rookie, raised on the country by his granddad he is send to Stalingrad to fight the most important fight of WW2, there are many soldiers among him, not all are given a rifle, in the first run at the germans Vassili is one of the only survivors from the hit, here he finds a rifle among the dead and snipers 5 german soldiers, watched by a political newspaper guy who turns him into a hero. From Germamy arives the master sniper, König, to put an end to Vasilli's rampage killings of highly placed german officers, the Duell has begun.Enemy At the Gates gives a very good portrait of the war, the evil side too, this has been done many times before, WW2 has and will always be a solid and interesting theme for making movies, the genius lies in picking up a Sub Theme of this that is still interesting, but also original, becuase many things has been seen before, this is a movie that focuses on something that hasn't been made a known movie about before, the Duell between the snipers.This movie is really well done, and you can see that every detail has been gone over and analyzed, this movie is really well put together, sadly the script isn't as well done as the movie itself, from outside the movie sounds very original considering it's a WW2 movie, however once you get going, you can very easily in the movie say that this movie was made in hollywood, the script is predictable, and for some reason it tries to combine the intense WW2 drama, with an intriguing love story. If the love story is true or not, i don't know, but never the less it makes the movie part ways early, intensity moving to one direction, while the romantic side story movies in the opposide direction, the purpose is to cross each others read in the end, and it does, and it's spotted after 30 minutes within the movie, however i must say that the love part of the movie has both it's good sides and bad sides, at first i was annoyed that they had to import a love story into a dramatic and intense war movie. However, it succeeds without destroying the dramatic point of the movie too much, it's more the predictability of the movie that makes for a less intense part here, not saying it's boring, becuase it's so well done that it can only be exhiting, however if i didn't already know that he was bound to survive to safe the happy end, i would have been chewing my nails on every Duell.One of the most amazing parts of this movie is the unbelivable realistic and detailed re-creation of Stalingrad during the war, this is one of the more convincing sides of the movie, and it really makes a good background for a realistic WW2 movie, it's obvious that the scenery has been done down to the very last detail, it looks really outstanding. Also the cinematography of the movie is really great, and the opening scene when they enter Stalingrad from the water is very well done, appears to be a scene inspired by the 'boarding the beach' scene in Saving Private Ryan, but never the less it looks great and the parts where the planes are gunning at the boats is terrificly made.The directing of this movie is well done, however i wouldn't characterize the directing perfect, as i think any experienced director could have made this movie as it is made, he had all the necesarry funds to build a great re-creation, the fantastic re-creation is not something we should thank the Diretor for, it's nothing extraordinary, but still a good direction.One thing that surprised me in this movie was Jude Law's great acting, i've always seen him as a bit shallow and without debth of realism, but in this movie he really does a great job and makes the movie more belivable, furthermore it's his stone face in the sniping scenes i think that makes for much of the intensity, he's playing a very serious chracter, and he succeds. The other main actors and actresses also does a great job, however they're not shining as much as Jude Law is, he is the one that makes the other performances fade a little to the background.To sum it all up, this is indeed a good movie, at times breathtaking and intense, other times a little hard to understand and too predictable, but it's still a solid movie, good entertainment, and definetely worth checking out if war dramas is a genre that interests you.7/10",7,0,1,28 April 2004
Die Hard," Fast paced action, a superb popcorn movie!
","Die HardJohn McClane is in California to visit his wife, whom he is seperated from due to different dreams of careers and he hasn't been able to handle he succes in her new job. But it's christmas so he comes to see his family, while picking up his wife at her firm, a group of terrorist shows up and holds all guests as hostages, John McClane manages to escape and is now the only hope to save the hostages and alert the police.Overall action movies are always very similar and predictable, and this movie is too predictable, perhaps that is the only big weakness of this movie, because who can deny there is something special with Die Hard. Die Hard is simply a very progressive, accelerated and perfectly paced action movie, not only does it tell a good story, and even comes with a few complexes, it also brings some of the best and most solid action ever to be seen.John McTiernan has proven to be a solid action director over the years, after the breakthrough with Predator he made this classic action flick, that never seems to be getting old, even now. 17 years later, it still works as well as it did 17 years ago, brilliant.This is just what I suppose we can call a perfect popcorn movie, the kind of movie where you lean back and just let the thrill ride begin, you know things will end happily, but still it entertains for the 2 hours it lasts, and it entertains at a very high level. Perhaps one of the weaknesses of the movie is the happy ending, I would have loved a darker ending, leaving something to think about, especially since there obviously is the problematic climax involved in the movie, there are some good side stories, especially the dramatic with John and Holly's marriage. Strangely that works out perfectly and we get to know everything about it, even though the movie actually doesn't spend much time explaining, it's just done so well and perfectly direct that we basically know everything about these two when the movie ends.I am not sure if this was a final breakthrough for Bruce Willis, but he definetely shows in this movie what great actor he is, we see a lot of different sides of him, the tough guy, the soft guy, and even better, the funny guy. I hardly ever lÃ¡ugh in movies, and I hate unserious movies that are trying to hard to make you laugh, but the jokes in this movie are perfect, especially the one signed by Bruce Willis, I loved his attitude, perfect performance!To sum it all up a bit, as we always do. This is a really great action classic, an unforgettable movie that never gets old, no matter how many times you watch it, this must be like the 5th time for me, and it's still highly entertaining, it has no slow moments and just moves out there at a perfect pace for 2 hours. The weak sides is perhaps that it's such a classic and traditional action movie that we know the end before the movie starts, sadly, an ending that would have left me breathless would have been better for me, but maybe other people think differently. I just like dark endings.8/10",8,1,2,23 June 2004
Love Actually," A warm original romantic story!
","I expected this movie to be good becuase i have read so many positive reviews, so i went to see it, and it got to admit it's one of the best romantic comedies i have seen in a while, the strength is really the original screenplay, a very warm and good story with a nice feeling too it, also the comedy of this movie doesn't go into being stupid like the usual case is with romantic comedies, so with a combination of a warm and good story and intelligent humour i can definitely say i love this movie, actually.The movie has a great cast too and they really do a good job displaying the complications of love, for once in a movie there people who aren't perfect, complications of love, the avkward moments love can create is displayed so well here you can totally relate to it, it's so realistic and so well done, and i just thought to myself that this could just as well be me.
The only real issue with this movie are the many on-going love stories at the same time, maybe if they had removed just a few of the many main characters, at times i felt confused over it all and it made the movie less intense of each person than it could have been, but in the end everything worked out, i especially loved the guy going to america, nice to see a british movie that can make fun of themself while displaying america as a strange country as well, everybody whom have seen this movie will know what i'm talking about if i say 'Bottle' hehe.Out of the love stories i preferred the one with Keira Knightley really the best, and the moment with the carol singers and the friends confession was so original and warm i couldn't help it to admire both these two in that exact moment, a well done scene, best of the movie, and a scene that is doomed to be copied in future movies.I could praise this movie so a while becuase it's been a while since i've seen a movie that had an aim of being an romantic comedy, and then it wasn't even stupid, it's nice to see that hollywood's dumb romantic comedies haven't taken over england yet, damn well done!8/10",8,0,2,27 February 2004
Signs," Intense, but not quite as atmospheric and thrilling as Shyamalan's other works.
","SignsGraham Hess is a former priest, who has lost all his faith in god when his wife died. Now he is living with his 2 children and his brother, they're living outside a small town running a farm. One day 'Signs' starts to appear in their crop fields, at first they think it's made my local people playing a joke on the, but as they watch the television similar 'Signs' starts to appear all the world. While this is going on Graham Hess is continues to struggle with the death of his wife and her last words 'Tell Merril to swing' and 'Tell Graham to see'.I am a keen admirer of Shyamalan's amazing talent to build up an intense atmosphere in his movies, especially 'The Sixth Sense' gives a fantastic view into his perfectionistic feeling for movies. And while this movie is still an admirable effort, it has more flaws than the other Shyamalan movies i have viewed, it's not nearly as thrilling and the awaited twist is a bit sloopy, but the movie is still very intense most of the way. And it does have a lot of Shyamalan's trademarks, i just think that the story itself is not nearly as engaging and interesting as the others, i think Shyamalans twist is also more predictable and expected than in his other movies, there are simply revealed too much for it to really shock. You see some of it coming most of the way, but there are still some things in the end that does indeed make other things in the movie make more sense, but it's nowhere near as powerful and outstanding done as in his earlier movies, but this is still a highly original movie that brings what one expects.I am sure that this is also one of the movies that will divide the general public opinion, the movie can really be understood two ways. Are they all living in some sort of dream? Or is the movie about faith in god and the fact that everything one way or the other, does indeed happen for a reason. I believe in the 2nd. My primary reason for this is that the movie just doesn't make sense if you understand it as a dream, too many things are revealed and too many things wouldn't make sense. If there were only 4 characters in the movie it would make sense, but there are many more, and it would all be too realistic for it all to be a dream. However the 2nd thing is what seems more real, and also what makes most sense, and i have a strong confidence that it is what Shyamalan wanted to say with this movie. 'Never lose faith, everything does happen for a reason'.The directing is definitely strong here, i think Shyamalan have once again proven that he is one of the most talented and interesting new directors, and i do look forward to seeing his new project as i find his style very engaging and interesting. Also i think he has his own style which is good, you can feel that its Shyamalan that have made the movie, and the original feeling he brings adds up for a good experience in watching his movies, he is really good at creating an intense atmosphere in the movie itself, even if it doesn't work out as well here as it have done in his other movies. But who can blame him, Sixth Sense was almost a definition of a perfect thriller.Another thing i have admired Shyamalan for earlier is his apparent skill to make child actors seem so reliable and realistic in their way, a place where many fails because children naturally aren't very experienced and generally also more immature and nervous, but this is the 3rd movie in a row where Shyamalan makes all of his cast play some very convincing roles and there is hardly ever a flaw here. Especially Joaquin Phoneis is fantastic, and i will always have the image of him with the helmet on burnt inside my eyes.To sum it all up a bit, i am as said a big admirer and fan of Shyamalans special style, for me he is one of the best directors i have seen since Carpenters early days in building up an intense atmosphere, and even though this movie doesn't come close to the perfection of The Sixth Sense, it's still a solid and thrilling movie that will surprise you, even if you think you have the ending predicted. 7/10",7,0,1,14 May 2004
The Sixth Sense," Stunningly original and intelling! outstanding!
","As close to perfection a movie can get, that's what i felt about this movie, it is almost a perfect movie in every aspect, i can't as i sit here now right after i saw the movie think of anything where there was an obvious flaw, even the smallest thing as i tried to see them in the end worked out. An amazingly thought through movie that is both engaging, intelligent, original, shocking and best of all it does not reveal its end until the very final moment, beautiful!Shyamalan have with this movie constructed something that is gribbing in so many ways, there are so many feelings all around and they are put together so damn well, not only by the script and directing itself, but the sound and the cinematography is stunning, as the music and sound gives life to the picture, an example is the first real 'horror' scene, where the camera is handheld, it gives a fantastic realistic view to the scene and makes it come alive a lot more than it would have if it had not been for the handheld camera, and the raw and tired look of the scene. Absolutely stunning work.I am as one can read very impressed with the movie, color filters, crookedness on the camera, everything has been used to create a movie full of atmosphere, it really reaches beyond and grabs you, it's amazing, shyamalan is sheer genius with this movie.For the acting i must say Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osmond is just amazing, this must for one be the best performance by a child actor i've ever seen, nearly without a single flaw from such a young man, even the scenes where he have to display raw feelings he does well, fantastic. All the supporting actors and actresses gives a good performance too, doing their share of lifting the movie to a top notch level.Stunning movie, it's a joy to see that movies like this can still be produced!10/10",9,1,2,4 April 2004
The Great Escape," An enjoyable and intelligent WW2 flick.
","Considering that i am quite young (born 1985) i usually dislike these older movies even though they have great rating and comments etc, but somehow this has changed my opinion, actually i think it was quite good, well, actually very good and very enjoyable, i think this may be because it is not dependant on special effects at all, it's a straight out movie without any computer reliable stuff, which makes for a movie where i dont fint myself thinking 'Damn that doesnt look to cool', which is nice.The movie itself is very entertaining, throughout almost 3 hours you can barely find a dull moment, which is fantastic, the movie is pretty fast paced all the way through, and it's enjoyable to see each character develop their personality and together as they work towards their goal. It is a well written story that holds your interest all the way through, and the acting is pretty nice too, something i usually dislike about older movies as well, but it works well here.Now one thing i can put thumps up to is the slightly untraditional ending, after they escaped rather early in the movie i had myself thinking how they would waste the final hour now, but they actually manage to throw in a few surprise, now without giving up the ending i must admit i think it was good that it didn't follow the typical happy ending where all slips away and lives happily ever after, the loss of some important characters combined with the survival of others makes for a nearly perfect ending, that is, as said, slighly untraditional. Also that is far more realistic than the typical Hollywood endings.8/10",8,4,7,14 March 2004
A Walk to Remember," A warm and natural romantic movie.
","Shane West stars as the local playboy, Landon, the popular guy, who has some moral issues and is quite a bad boy, he messes up from the start and is forced to take extra special classes, sort of a community service for his wrongs, here he gets to know the geeky and unpopular Jaime (Mandy Moore), at first Landon refuses to talk to her and avoids her at all costs, but slowly Jaime gains on Landon..The geeky girl inspires the popular guy for a 180 degree change, the stereotype hollywood story have its prints on this movie, but compared to all the other teen movies now a days this movie is after all different, it does not try to be funny with stupid jokes, it's natural and realistic and deals with more than just love, there are many other things to be considering in this movie, there's a lot of moral questions which are put up to question, but this movie is very warm and is told with great patience.The strength of this movie is definetely that it tries to be a serious romantic movie that will make you feel and think rather than the usual dumb crap that Hollywood spits out, there is never any doubt this is a Hollywood story, but it still manages to engage it's viewer and i must admit i at several times were at the verge of dropping a tear, or even two.
The cast is very well done, shane west and mandy moore have a great chemistry througout the movie, and i think it's good to see that Mandy Moore can more than just sing, but actually also act, multi talent i guess, at least she does a fine job in this movie.Now one thing i really loved about this movie as well was that it does not rush into romantic sequences, i loved all the weird small moments where Landon tries to act cool towards Jaime, especially the scene in the bus where he's a cold hearted b*****d i liked, it's good to see that it had no rush reaching it's initial goal.Now as i made this sound all very well, and it is a good movie, but there are some flaws which i kinda disliked, for a starter i think it all became a lil bit typically hollywood when everybody made up with their wrongs towards each other and it ended with everyone happy and smiling, and the end is also a pretty poor attempt on making the perfect ending, in my opinion it should have ended with Shane West's voice over while looking at the fall weather.However, even though this movie has it's parts of typical hollywood scripts, it also has many parts where it stands out, and among them are the story itself, i think this is one one of the better romantic movies from USA lately, it's nice to see that not all romantic movies have to be dumb now a days, that there still is a market that focuses on touching ones heart, so even though many parts of this movie has been seen before, i can not deny that it touched my heart a lot, and it was a very moving and well told story, i think it should have a lot of credit for that. lately it's not many movies that really can touch my heart i think, but this did a fine job doing that, which is brilliant, i love it when a movie reaches inside.8/10",8,0,0,6 April 2004

","This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.This is definetely a 'must see' masterpiece.",9,553,780,25 December 2002
