Saturday Night Fever," Dated
","S a lot of homoerotic music, which is fine, but the woman of the night spreading it in the car and smothering herself with men until she is knocked up and prego was disgusting,
There is some mecho fighting and car scenes so makes up for it.",Null,3,7,8 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Worst movie ever
","It has been a very long time since I saw a movie this bad and one might say that it is somewhat unfair that I write a review of it without having watched all of it. Yes, I deleted the file mid-way. Then again, I do not need to have taken nausea medicine to know it was a bad idea and I do not wish to lose any more time to this terrible remake.I was only motivated to write after reading the inordinate number of glowing critic reviews about this payola fave. This reboot has no redeeming qualities at all. I cannot even wrap my head around the view that it is so bad that it is funny.A comedy should invoke laughter or at least a giggle or two: the best I could manage was roll my eyes at the shorthaired Mary Sue.",Null,19,23,8 June 2019
