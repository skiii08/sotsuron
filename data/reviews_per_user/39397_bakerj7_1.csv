The Lobster," A dissenting opinion
","Good writing has engaging characters in an interesting story infused with metaphor, irony, moral ambiguity, and other nuances, wrapped around a pertinent issue. This movie has none of that. It is a haphazard mess of unrelated metaphors and irony, badly scripted, with a meandering plot. If it's intended to be a parody of bad avant-garde Eurotrash cinema, it took two hours to accomplish what could have been done in one. The only laughs were at a flamingo and camel wandering around in the background. The depictions of horrid cruelty to animals were disturbing. It dragged on so long I wish it had been my own eyes (and ears) that had been gouged out. By the end of the movie I didn't give a flip about any of the characters, nor how it ended, only hoping that it would mercifully end as soon as possible. We continued watching hoping that something interesting would happen at some point, that it would actually go somewhere or come to some sensible conclusion. We only threw good time after bad. But hindsight is 20/20. Do yourself a favor; skip this movie, and spend two hours doing something more enjoyable, like chewing on tin foil.",2,14,18,6 August 2016
