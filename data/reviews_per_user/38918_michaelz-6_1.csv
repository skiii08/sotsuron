Scarface," Great Movie!
","Such a very greatly made movie! Most of the characters in the movie died, though. Tony, Gina, his best friend, etc. WOW! The music of this movie was also made very nicely. I am actually looking forward to buying the soundtrack of this film. Well, we won't be seeing any more Tony Montana :( , but that's OK! And he always used to say the word 'fuck'. That got me laughing how he even said that to United States oficials and bankers. I believe Al Capino was a very great actor in this film, and it's really sad how this actually happened in the 1980s... Thousands of Cubans actually were criminals. That's very hard to believe!<ul><li>Michael</li></ul>",10,0,1,3 January 2005
