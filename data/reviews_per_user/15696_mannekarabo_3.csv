Hereditary," Eerie and Subtle
","Hereditary is eerie and subtle in its tone.
The horrific nature is not in jump scares or sound effects. There is very little if any cgi.
The fear is in 'what could my neighbors be doing?'
Its also in its researched approach. It seems like a look into real watch craft. They started us with Thomasin in the witch and now this. They dont even use gibberish latin or aramaic. They say their incantations in english which drives home the simplicity of witch craft. Watch this movie to be unsettled. 
I gave it an 8 because of the above and deducted two points because of its sometimes slow pace. But maybe I am impatient.",8,2,4,30 June 2018
Rocketman," I was not expecting this
","It was a waste of Taron Egerton's talent and his looks.
Didnt like the musical aspect though im sure Elton did, I mean how else would we expect to see elton john's life. But often it gets too much and often feels like they are just trying to skip over the important bits of his childhood. In some parts, the theatrical and musical aspects work very well while in some parts it feels like a diversion.
If u watch this movie, watch it for Taron Egerton. He has come a loooooong long way from kingsman. Otherwise try your best to ignore the overtop spectacle that attempts to match the spectacle of elton john but goes way over top like micheal bay special effects. The emotional aspects are soppy, weak n feel rushed only helped by Taron Egerton's performance. Its like they just wanna get over it like we're in rehab and being lied to by the movie.
Its a must watch dont get me wrong but for me, its no bohemian rhapsody.",5,3,5,6 August 2019
Joker," Change
","Its a movie about change. Metamorphosis through traumatic events. Joker goes from wanting to tell jokes to being a joke with a terrible set up but a wonderfully violent punchline. He embodies everything we have become as society. All we want is a chance to make our dreams come true without being set up like in reality shows. Joker brings the lie of society on its knees in a 1970s back drop that kind of says what u are experiencing in 2019 is nothing new. Great performances from Gotham City, Joaquin Phoenix, Frances Conroy (she showed me she isnt just good on tv). They made watching Robert De Niro who is a star, feel like watching exactly what he was in this movie, a supporting actor which isn't usually the case. I enjoyed this movie because it did something that no other movie with the Joker has ever done, it showed a bloody, violent side to the character that other movies couldnt do, I would love to see more of Joaquin in this role being violent in a batman movie. Its time for batman to grow up and this movie is how we get there. And if it is then you would be missing out on a great beginning of a beautiful journey in DC and WB cinema!",9,1,3,12 November 2019
