The Blair Witch Project," Not for everyone, but scared the crap out of me
","If this movie works for you, you'll love it.  If not, you'll hate it.  I'd say it ranks with the 80's version of 'The Shining' and 'Aliens' as one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.  It's not a splatter film, not 'Friday the 13th', not 'Nightmare on Elm Street'.  Frankly, if that's the kind of thing that scares you, the horror in this movie is probably too subtle for you anyway.",9,1,2,19 July 1999
Pi," An effective psychological thriller masquerading as science fiction
","I just want to amplify what others have touched on.  This movie is not so much about its subject matter as its subject -- that is, it's about poor, obsessed, half-crazy Max and not about computers or number theory.  So the computer he uses looks lower-tech than a TRS-80.  So the chip he uses has only four pins, and magically fits into the socket he's already designed for it.  If you dwell on the details, you'll lose sight of the brilliance of the movie.The camera work, soundtrack and mania of the lead character all work together to make a gripping, tooth-grinding psychological drama.  You are left with two opposite but alternative interpretations that center around the old professor's warning about his obsession warping his view of reality.Was the professor concealing the truth to protect Max from his own discoveries, or was the professor warning Max against letting his obsession cloud his thinking?The movie is full of subtleties that can fit either interpretation equally well.",10,2,5,4 February 1999
Mission: Impossible II," Almost bad enough to recommend just for how bad it is
","I remember thinking about 20 minutes into it 'Okay, the acting is terrible, but the plot's okay'.  An hour into it I was thinking, 'Okay, the plot sucks too, but the action scenes are good.'  By the end, even Woo's trademark 'bullet ballet' couldn't redeem this movie. The entire audience was laughing at just how cliched and obvious this movie was.  I go a long way on 'suspension of disbelief' when watching action flicks, but this movie ate up my reserves and left me on empty well before the grand finale.  It became a game to see JUST HOW MANY tired cliches they could fit in at the end.Except for the fact that characters actually DIED, the stunts and action seemed better suited to the A-Team than to a modern thriller.  It would have been far more effective if it at least had Mr. T and George Peppard -- or better yet, Peter Graves and Leonard Nimoy -- people you EXPECT to see in cheesy over-the-top cartoonish tripe like this.Maybe the low budget of Hong-Kong films is a GOOD thing.  I usually love John Woo movies, but if this is what happens when he gets his hands on a major studio budget, I wish he'd go back to the chop-socky stuff that made him famous.This movie is almost bad enough to be recommended on that score alone.  It's no Plan 9 From Outer Space, but it is stupendously awful.",1,6,11,26 May 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Just go see it
","One commenter said that he could tell the people who enjoyed this movie don't get out much.  That's pretty arrogant.  The Shattuck theater in Berkeley was full of people who must not get out much then.True to Coen form, the movie exemplifies what I like about indie films. It's quirky.  It doesn't conform to an 'approved' plot formula.  It's experimental.  I can pay $8.00 for a movie like that, absolutely HATE the film, and still feel that the chance was worth taking.  Turns out I thoroughly enjoyed O Brother, so that's like getting a bonus.But the next friggin' Mel Gibson historical whitewash, or the next tom hanks 2-hour cliche or the next billy crystal meg ryan syrupy romantic comedy had better be on-the-money or I'll feel I got ripped off.So if you want to go see what everyone else is seeing so you can like what everyone else liked and jabber about the same stupid characters reshot ad nauseam, then you probably want to stay away from anything like this movie. Go rent Sleepless in Seattle for the 100th time and stay in bed.  God forbid you should risk seeing a bad movie.But if you like seeing something different from time to time, then get to the theater, pony up your eight bucks and watch the movie.   You'll probably enjoy it & if you don't you can still feel thankful for the opportunity. Just don't let some arrogant film snob or some overrated TV fat guy tell you you're not supposed to like it.",8,4,5,19 January 2001
