The Rock," One of the greatest action movies ever.
","This movie is awesome! This is truly one of the greatest action movies of all time brought to you by Micheal Bay, the director of great action movies like 'Armageddon', 'Bad boys', and 'Pearl Harbor' and the Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer of such movies like 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and 'Crimson Tide', and 'National Treasure'. I am not a big fan of Micheal Bay's movies because 'Pearl Harbor' sucked. But this is clearly his best movie. There is a great story, a great script, great acting, great special effects, its funny, and its dramatic. The music is also great. I think its the same music used in 'Pirates of the Caribbean' but as a good thing. Its good music. Over all, this is truly a great movie. I don't want to give anything away. This is a great movie. 10/10.",10,13,19,25 April 2007
The Benchwarmers," One of the 3 funniest movies of 2006
","This movie was hilarious! I literally could not stop laughing. I am only 13, I saw it when I was 12. I thought that it was funny. My brother says that its really just meant for people like 9-17. (I think) But I like this kind of comedy. Non-stop slapstick comedy with all kinds of comedy from bathroom jokes to... other jokes that I don't know what you would call them. This movie was just so funny. It had laughs all the way from start to finish. This movie was actually kind of inspiring and good. It could inspire those kids who aren't good at sports that they can do anything if they all work together. This was a very, very funny movie that actually turned out to be kind of good. One of the funniest and one of the best of 2006. 10/10.",10,1,4,15 May 2007
Catch Me If You Can," a good biography
","This movie was pretty good. It really told the story of what Frank Abagnale Jr. did back then. Leonardo DiCaprio did really good and so did Tom Hanks. This movie turned out to be a dramadey including such scenes like how when Frank became a pilot for Pan Am, he seduced an older woman! That man is a player. It turned out to be Ellem Pompeo, who I think is hot. This movie told the story of how he became a pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer. Not very many people can do that. This was a good movie. I saw it in theaters and, believe it or not, I thought it would sort of be like a funny action/adventure about how somebody is after somebody because something happened or something. But, boy was I dead wrong? But I like what I saw. This was a good movie. 8/10.",8,2,3,15 May 2007
Chinatown," One of the best movies of the 70s
","This movie is spectacular. Chinatown has one of of the greatest stories ever and one of the best scripts I've ever seen in a movie. This movie is incredible. It has a great mystery that has thrills all the way to the end. Some people thought it was confusing. I didn't think it was. I thought that it was very original and smart. This movie was good. It really just shows you what it is really like on how a normal person tries to uncover a great scandal. John Huston Plays a perfect villain as Noah Cross. This has so many thrills, its as if the people that did this just don't want Jack Nicholson's character to find out. All in all, this was a great movie. I give acting a 10, story, a 10, script, a 10, and everything else, a 10. This movie was one of the 5 best of the 70s and one of the best ever. This was a great movie. 10/10.",10,2,4,16 May 2007
Happy Gilmore," My favorite Adam Sanlder movie ever!
","This movie is hilarious! It is just so funny. It is full of non-stop laughs for me, because I love this kind of comedy. I love this movie. It is one of my ten favorite comedies of all time. It is also my favorite Adam Sandler movie. I just love it. It is very, very funny for me. It could be funny for you if you like this kind of comedy. This movie has tons of very memorable quotes that are very funny. So, all in all, in the end, I love this movie and I always will. I love it. 10/10. I have to do ten lines, so, this is a good movie. This is a good movie. This is a good movie. This good movie. This is a good movie. This is a good movie. This is a good movie. This is a good movie.",10,11,14,10 June 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," One of my favorite Sci-fi movies ever
","I don't get why people don't like this movie. It is full of action, it has a good story, and good acting. I think that the story is really good because of how it happens. I liked this movie. I thought that it was good. It had some of the best special effects ever. I don't know what else to say. Just ignore the next couple of lines because I have to do ten. This was a good movie. This was a good movie. This was a good movie. Go see it now. Go see it now. Go see it now. This was a good movie. This was a goo movie. This was a good movie. go see it now. Go see it now. Go see it now. So, all in all, I loved this movie. 10/10.",10,1,2,21 May 2007
Zodiac," I expected JFK. I got a dramedy.
","This movie was bad and good at the same time. I was expecting a movie like JFK that was a great political mystery/thriller directed by the great Oliver Stone that was based on a true story and was still able to give you thrills. But what I got was a surprisingly funny crime drama directed by the relatively known/unknown David fincher who brought us se7en. One of the greatest mysterious cop thrillers of all time. But none of the thrills that were in that were in this. I got a 3 hour-long dramedy that was based on a true story that could not provide you with any mystery or thrills. There was absolutely no mystery and barely any thrills as a matter of fact. It could not deliver the goods of a thriller because it already happened and people of the San Francisco Bay Area, like me, already know what happened and did not feel any thrills. But it was still good. A little long, but still good. I don't know what the point of it was, but it was still good.",8,0,2,23 April 2007
Alien," One of the best horror movies ever
","This movie is great. This is one of the best horror movies ever and is quite possibly, one of the best movies ever. 'Alien' perfectly combines horror, sci-fi, and is packed with thrills. 'Alien' is about how in the future, a group of workers on a mining ship get a report of an SOS and are called to investigate. They are sent to a world that is deserted and an alien of an unknown species gets into their ship. After they find out what this alien is capable of, they realize the dangers and they have to try to escape it. This movie is now a classic to the horror/sci-fi genre. There are lots of things that 'Alien' is known for today. I will not tell you anything because you might not have seen this movie. If you have, then I have one for you. Acid. You know what I mean. This was a great movie. 10/10.",10,1,3,14 May 2007
Blades of Glory," The funniest movie so far this year!
","This movie is incredibly funny. It is full of non-stop laughs the entire length of the film. It is just so funny. I love how Jon Heder plays the sort of stuck up character since he was raised by a rich man and Will Ferrel plays the fat obnoxious drunk guy, but all the women want him. That is classic comedy. This movie is just so funny. It is also funny how the girl who plays Pam on 'The Office' plays the nobody servant to her brother and sister who are famous ice skaters who, Major spoilers here, turn out to be inbred at the end! Just so funny! This movie is totally one of the funniest movies of the decade. Will Ferrel and Jon Heder make the perfect comedy team. I saw this movie the day it came out and then I saw it the next day. This is funny. A great movie. 10/10.",10,3,6,5 May 2007
Glory," An amazing movie
","This movie is amazing. It is very, very, very good. It is great. I love this movie. I think that it is sad. Especially how it ends. That is very sad. I don't want to tell you anything to ruin it for you. I just love this movie. It is so good. It is very well made. The story is amazing since it was all based on a true story. Matthew Broderick does a really good performance as Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. Denzel Washinton also does really good. There is a great supporting cast including Morgan Freeman, Carry Elwes, and Andre Braugher. 'Glory' is a great movie. Everybody in the United States should see this movie because it is such a great historical story about the United States Civil War. I love this movie. 10/10.",10,1,2,9 June 2007
Forrest Gump," One of the greatest movies ever made
","This contains spoilers. This movie is fantastic. It is excellent. It is great. Only one word can describe this movie. Perfect. This is a perfect movie that was a landmark film. This is a great movie. It is incredibly well made with a great story and script. Tom Hank's performance is just amazing. He does an amazing job. It is easily the best performance of the 90's. It is also the best performance as a mentally retarded person. It is just amazing. I love this movie. I think that the greatest part about this movie is the fact that it teaches you a lesson. It teaches you that you don't have to be a smart person to do incredible things. That is why I love this movie. It's amazing. I mean, he has leg braces, which he breaks off when he tries to run, he becomes a college football all-star, he becomes a Vietnam veteran who wins the congressional medal of honor. That is just amazing. I don't want to tell you anything else if I haven't already ruined it for you. It is is just amazing. I can understand why people hate this movie. I am not like them. I love this movie. *Spoilers* What I also find to amazing is the fact that he only has four friends throughout the movie. Three of which die and the other loses both of his legs. His mother dies of cancer, Bubba gets killed in combat in Vietnam, Jenny has AIDs, and Leuitanit Dan loses his legs in Vietnam. That is amazing. I love this movie. This is one of my ten favorite of all time. I think that it is one of the ten best of the nineties, and is easily one of the best 30 over all ever made. I think that it is underrated, even though it is at number 80 something. This is a great movie. 10/10.",10,2,5,6 June 2007
The Bourne Identity," A unique action movie
","The Bourne Idenity was a very good and new kind of action movie. It is a very good mystery that was based on a good book. This movie is full of very well shot action scenes and is full of twists all the way to the end. Matt Damon does a great performance as a spy/secret agent. This movie is a different take on espionage action movies. This movie does not deserve the negative reviews that it got. People say that it is too confusing. Yeah, newsflash. Its called 'mystery'! Oooh! (Emphasize) People may not like this movie. But I do. This was a good movie. I like it. I don't know what else there is to say. People should see this movie. 8/10.",8,0,1,9 May 2007
"I, Robot"," A pretty good action/sci-fi
","This is a pretty good action movie and a great movie over all. The story is really good. The special effects are all very good, considering the fact that about half the movie is completely animated. I love it. The acting is also really good with great performances by Will Smith, some woman that nobody knows, and Shia Labeouf. I love that kid. He had a very funny character in this movie. I think that people should like this movie. I really like it. We don't know if the future will be like this in the future. This is a great movie that is full of action. I love it. I think that this is one of my 10 favorite sci-fi movies of all time. I like this movie. 9/10.",9,0,1,10 June 2007
Disturbia," Surprisingly great!
","This movie was awesome. I did not expect it to be this good. It is the perfect teen thriller to watch on a weekend night. David Morse plays the perfect villain for this kind of movie. There a lots of thrills to keep you entertained. The thrills are unpredictable. It is funny, dramatic, scary, thrilling, and fun. This was a great movie over all. This was my favorite movie so far this year next to 300. It was so cool had David Morse just some how knew that they were on to him and that he had a torture chamber and a room for keeping all his tools for just cutting up his women that he kills and how the cop that was in charge of watching him was the cousin of the teacher that he hit. A great story with a great script, surprisingly good acting, and perfect thrills. 10/10.",10,1,4,24 April 2007
Aliens," One of my all time favorites
","This movie is excellent. No. I have an even better word for that. Perfect. This movie is perfect. This is a perfect movie for when you and your friends are in the mood for a good action movie. This movie perfectly combines action, horror, sci-fi, and lots of thrills. It is even funny and sad in parts. It is also very entertaining and fast paced. I've only seen the extended version. That version is two and half hours long. By the time it was over, I thought it was only about half-way over. It is just so good. It has a great cast of Signourey Weaver, Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, and... others that I can't remember. James Cameron did a great job in the script, story, and the directing of the movie. This was a great movie. 10/10.",10,1,3,12 May 2007
Independence Day," Incredibly underrated!
",This movie is one of the most underrated movies of all time. It has great special effects and a really good story for sci-fi/action. The script is also good for its genre. I think that the speech given by Bill Pullmam's character is the best speech ever given in a movie. I think that it is very dramatic. The movie is dramatic and is also funny. I just love this movie. I can never hate this movie. I don't know why. This movie an all star cast and it became one of the biggest blockbusters in years and one of the highest grossing movies of all time. I don't see how people can just give it such a low rating. 6.2? You have got to be kidding me! I love this movie and I always will. It is very underrated and it definitely deserves to have a higher rating and more credit than it has right now. I love this movie. 10/10.,10,0,2,27 June 2007
Batman Begins," The best super hero movie ever, and possibly the best movie ever.
","This movie is just simply amazing. It is not one of those super hero movies that are only good for the action like spider-man or other movies like that. This movie is good for two things. The acting and the story. The acting is definitely Christian Bale's best performance ever. The story is also great. I am glad that it changed the story of the original Burton Batman films because this was a better one. This movie teaches you a lesson. It teaches you that there is a big difference between justice and revenge. I don't want to tell you too much, because that would just ruin it for you. This was a great movie. This is the best superhero movie to date, and it might be the best movie ever. Maybe. It could happen. This was a good movie. 10/10.",10,1,2,20 May 2007
Saving Private Ryan," The greatest war movie ever made
","This movie is truly the best war movie ever and one of the greatest movies over all of all time. It is incredibly well made. The first 20 minutes of this movie is one of the greatest scenes of all time. It made people realize the pain and what it felt what it was like to be at D Day. It is truly amazing. This movie is very well made. The cinematography. The sound and special effects. The score by John Williams. This is easily Steven Spielberg's best movie ever. He totally deserved to win the Best Director award at the Oscars. It should have totally won best picture over Shakespeare in love. In the end, after the fateful battle at the end, i will not tell what happens, it justs leaves us with one question. Are the lives of eight men worth saving one? Probably not. One of the greatest movies ever. 10/10.",10,4,7,25 April 2007
JFK," A historical conspiracy theorist makes the greatest mystery film of all time
","This is my first review in over a year, so I might not be all that good on reviewing this. But anyway, here I go. I absolutely love this movie, and for so many reasons too. When you've got Oliver Stone directing and Kevin Costner playing the lead role back in the early 90s at least before their careers were almost over, you can't go wrong. J.F.K. completely cover the whole J.F.K. assassination and conspiracy cover-up, which was all based on a true story. Kevin Costner couldn't have done a better role as Jim Garrison. This movie brought a whole new meaning to the mystery genre. It proved that, not only does it not have to be solved or have a happy ending, but that stories amazing as this one can be based on a true story and have proof that it all happened. Jim Garrison proved, in this movie and in real life, that there was a huge scandal/conspiracy cover-up behind this action that shocked our country. I believe it to be 100% true, too. There is so much evidence supporting these conspiracy theories, which prove it to be true. Well, I'm sorry if that review wasn't all that good. I'm only 15. And that's it for now. Until next time, rock and roll, and enjoy the good movies out there while they still last.",10,0,10,30 October 2008
Ghost Rider," Definitely underrated!
","This movie is incredibly underrated! I can't believe the rating that it is has. 5.5? What the hell is up with that? I loved this movie. I think that the only bad thing about this movie was the acting for the last 10 minutes. But other than that, it was a great movie. There were great special effects, a really good story, and enough action to keep me entertained. I love this movie. I think that it is one of my five all-time favorite comic book movies of all time. In order, it is Batman Begins, X-men 3, Ghost Rider, Spider-man 2, and then Spider-man. Those are my five favorite comic book movies ever made. I give special effects a 10, acting a 9, action 10, and story/script 10. All in all, I loved this movie. One of my five favorite so far this year next to 300, Disturbia, Pirates 3, then Ghost Rider, and then Blades of Glory. I love this movie and I think that it is incredibly underrated and that all the critics are wrong. 10/10.",10,4,6,6 June 2007
Transformers," Transformed me by surprise
","This was a hell of a lot better than I thought it would be. The first trailer for it came out last July, a year before the movie premiered. You really had no idea what it would be about. I am only 14, so I did not grow up in the 80s. At the time I did not want to see it. A couple of months later, in November I saw a trailer for it. That showed me that it was action packed and looked like it was very intense. In May, I went to see Pirates 3.(Which was great by the way) Anyway, the trailer explained the whole ordeal. Lots of action, great special effects, and of course, Shia Laboef. He makes the world go round. After I saw that trailer, I knew immediately that I wanted to see this movie the day it came out. I saw it one July third. I was caught completely by surprise. I did not expect it to be as good as it was. I was Transformed.I was in awe at the end of the movie. It was so surprisingly good. I thought would just give it a seven, an eight at the most. But this clearly would get higher than that. Let me just say all the good things right now. The action was practically non-stop. It was one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time. There was action from beginning to end. The special effects were the best ever. Literally. The transformations were the most realistic high quality visuals ever shot. The next great thing was Shia Labeof. He made this movie. He is a great actor. There was also great acting by Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel. It also had a great supporting cast of Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson, and others. I loved this movie. Another thing that caught me by surprise was the comedy. It was incredibly funny throughout. That was very surprising. Almost everything about it was good even the story and script. Now, for the bads.There were very few bads, but they were some major details. The main actress just can't act. Also, the dialog for her was pretty bad. But I think that's about it. Michael did a great job directing this movie. This has been his best movie ever. I used to think that my favorite movie by him was The Rock. It's not anymore. Now, it's Transformers.This was a great movie. I think that it is the best Sci-Fi movie ever. I think that it's better than Star War, The Matrix, and Terminator 2 combined. This is a lot like Independence day. Its a saga of people all over the US and they have to unite to beat the things from outer space. The movie was actually even dramatic in parts. Its kind of like the rock. How its really funny, but also turns out to be really dramatic towards the end. I loved this movie. I think that it is the best sci-fi movie of all time, one of the best action movies of all time, and quite possibly, one of the greatest movies of all time. Maybe not but I think it is because I loved it so much. I loved this movie and that's all I can say. I have been transformed because it caught me completely by surprise. I have been Transformed. 10/10.",10,2,5,8 July 2007
Dumb and Dumber," One of the smartest and funniest movies ever!
","This movie is hilarious! It is just so funny. It was the first ever PG-13 movie that I ever saw. I really liked it back then, (When I was 5) and I still like it now (I'm 13). I have seen this movie over 100 times. I don't think that this movie will be a movie that I liked only at an early age. I will continue to like it for the rest of my life. It is very funny. I don't want to tell you any lines because that might ruin it for you. This was a funny movie. I just love this movie. This goes under my top ten favorite comedies. My top ten comedies are: Spaceballs, Happy Gilmore, Dumb and Dumber, Billy Madison, The Benchwarmers, American Pie, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Caddyshack, Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector, and The School of Rock. Those are my favorite comedies. I hope you like this movie as much as me. This is a funny movie. 10/10.",10,1,2,23 May 2007
National Treasure," A pretty good action/adventure with a great mystery
","This movie is not that bad. It has a great story with one of the greatest mysteries in a movie ever. It has pretty good acting with enough action to keep you entertained. The story starts out pretty good and ends pretty good. There's not a lot that I can tell you right now, but its pretty good. I don't know what else there is to say right now. Just ignore the next couple of lines because I have to do 10 lines. It is a good movie. It is a good movie. Go see it now. Go see it now. It is a good movie. It is a good movie. Go see it now.

The Da Vinci Code," One of my 5 least favorite movies.
","You might like this movie. This just wasn't for me. It was practically like a modern day film-noir. I just didn't like this movie. If you liked it, you probably won't agree with me. This movie was terrible! It was just so bad. First of all, let me start with the goods. Um, oh thats right. There was nothing good about this movie! Now, the bads. This movie was just so bad! It had absolutely no story. It just went on and on and on and on and on for about 2 1/2 hours. It had such talented actors like Tom Hanks and Ian Mcellan (I don't know how his name is spelled). It was just a waste of talent. This movie knew exactly how to ruin such a great book. The book had a great mystery and story. I just wanted somebody to make a movie about it. But I wasn't expecting this. There is absolutely no mystery. There is no drama and it is not thrilling like the genre says. Also, before I finish, if you have seen it, that part with the car going between the bus and the wall or something, that doesn't happen in real life! But this movie does deliver one good thing. The movie was fast. Somehow, but I don't know. This was a horrible movie. I think that it is the second worst movie ever next to 'Sea of Fear'. This was horrible. 1/10.",1,0,2,21 May 2007
The Departed," The best cop thriller since 'Goodfellas'
","This movie is excellent. It is definitely the greatest movie of 2006 is one of the 5 best movies of the decade. Everything about it is good. The story is one of the best ever. The story is just amazing. The acting is also incredible by almost everybody that was in it. The script is also great. This is definitely The best cop movie since Goodfellas, or you can say the second best cop movie ever made. This is Scorcese's best job directing ever. He deserved to win for Goodfellas. This movie was definitely worthy of the Oscars that it won. It deserved to take home best picture, director, and screenplay. I am surprised that Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't even nominated for this. This was a great movie. Scorcese's second best. 10/10.",10,2,4,21 May 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," One of the funniest movies I have ever seen!
","This movie is hilarious. It is just so funny. I barely ever stopped laughing. It is just so funny. i can't sop saying it. It has a great comedy cast with stars such as Will Ferrel, Steve Carrel, David Koechner, Paul Rudd, Christina Applegate, and lots of others stars with a cameo by Jack Black. I haven't even written a comment on this movie after almost three years. This movie is so funny. I don't have anything else to say except for that this movie is funny. This movie is funny. This movie is funny. This movie is funny. I love when they sing afternoon delight and the battle of the news teams. Incredibly funny. I have to give this movie more than a ten, but I can't so, 10/10.",10,0,2,5 May 2007
Halloween," The best slasher of all time!

Halloween is an excellent horror movie that has scared me more than any other horror movie. I'm serious! I just love this movie. This is the original slasher! This is easily the best slasher of all time. This is the perfect horror movie to watch with your friends with all the lights off. This is the perfect horror movie. Period. It is just so good and scary. Michael Myers is the perfect horror movie killer. The story is really good and the acting is really good for a independent movie. I love this movie. 10/10.",10,1,2,10 June 2007
Casino Royale," The best Bond ever
","This movie is excellent. It is full of non-stop action, adventure, and lots and lots of thrills. This clearly the best Bond ever. It is just so good. It has everything a modern action movie needs and everything that a James Bond movie needs. It is just amazing. It has great special effects, surprisingly great acting, a really good story, and a good script. It is entertaining throughout and there are great shots. About ten minutes in, there is a great action scene. I don't want to say anything else, because that would ruin it for you. But there are still lots of other action scenes. Since there were only like 6 good action movies in 2006, I have to say that this is my favorite. This is also one of my favorite action movies ever. This was one of the best movies of the year. This was a great movie. 10/10.",10,0,4,14 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Just truly amazing.
","Star wars is my favorite movie of all time. It is truly one of the greatest movies ever. I love it. You are not a movie person without seeing star wars. It is amazing how it was made. This movie is the most talked about space adventure of all time. It is one of the most groundbreaking sagas in Hollywood history. It didn't just change the way we look at movies. It changed the way movies are made. This movie is truly amazing. quote another member of IMDb when I say this, 'A kid's fantasy. An adults memory.' You can remember this movie for the rest of your lives. The special effects were great for back then and the score of John Williams for this movie is the best ever. This movie was the biggest box office bust back then of all time. This movie should have won all the awards it was nominated for. 10/10.",10,0,0,24 April 2007
300," One of the greatest movies of the decade
","This movie is incredible. It is a historical landmark epic of a film. This movie will be remembered in the near future. The cinematography and special effects are amazing. The scene with all the arrows just being launched is a masterpiece and a work of art. This movie is great. It is full of action and is a great drama and a great ancient war movie. It tells the tale of the one of the greatest battles in history. It was never meant to be as accurate as possible. I hate how people hate this movie because they were expecting a history lesson instead of an action/war. This movie was meant to be an entertaining action movie revolved around a very important battle. People think that Frank Miller is stupid because he doesn't know what happened. He does know what happened. He just wanted more people to like it because of the action. This movie is just simply amazing. I can't believe that they spent only 60 million on it. The acting, story, script, special effects/cinematography/costumes/music/sets are amazing. 10/10",10,1,7,3 May 2007
The Great Escape," One of the greatest war movies of all time
","This movie is fantastic. I love it. I just love it. It is an amazing movie. It has a great cast, really good acting, and a good story for the fact that it was all based on a true story. This movie is even funny and sad in parts. I think that it is also a really smart movie because of the way that they do all these things just to escape. I don't want to tell you too much because that might ruin it for you. I love this movie. I think that this is one of the ten greatest war movies ever made. I think that it is also my second favorite war movies ever next to Saving Private Ryan. I think that (In no specific order) the ten greatest war movies of all time are: Saving Private Ryan, The Great Escape, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse now, The Bridge On The River Kwai, Schindler's list, CasaBlanca, and Glory. I love this movie. 10/10.",10,1,4,10 June 2007
Click," Average Sandler movie.
","This movie is just pretty much an average Sandler movie if you are looking for comedy. This is really sort of a drama that I thought was sad at the end. I will not tell what you happens. It has a good story with surprisingly good acting by Adam Sandler. The script was okay though. I am glad that it was not just a comedy because it would not have been a good movie then because it is not that funny. It is funny in parts, but not funny throughout like 'Billy Madison' or 'Happy Gilmore'. I thought that this was a good movie. It is a sad movie to me. I liked it. 7/10. Just ignore the couple of lines because I have to do 10 lines. Oh, I just did. Ignore that line.",7,1,3,18 May 2007
Braveheart," One of the greatest movies ever
","This movie is just simply amazing. It is very well made and is a very entertaining movie. It is full of action, drama, and romance, focused around one of the greatest wars of all time. William Wallace, i'm not Scottish so I don't know if he exists or not, is a hero. If he does exist, he is a hero for Scotland. It is such a great movie. It is very sad. The battle scenes are full of great cinematography and are actually quite entertaining. This is just a really good movie. I can't say anything else about it. Mel Gibson gives a great performance in this movie. I can't believe that he wasn't even nominated for best actor at the Oscars. But he did win Best Director which he deserved. This is a great movie. 10/10.",10,4,7,9 May 2007
Dodgeball," That's it boy. Get in there nice and deep-like
",This movie is hilarious! It is one of my all time favorite comedies. The line above is one of my favorite in this movie. I don't want to tell you too much because that might ruin it for you. This movie had non-stop laughs for me. It is just full of one-liners and slap-stick comedy. This movie is so funny. This was among the three funniest of the year next to 'Anchorman' and 'Naplolean Dynamite'. This movie is just so funny. It has a great cast. It is very well written. It has a good story for a comedy. This is one of my top ten favorite comedies and is one of my top 30 favorite over all. This is a funny movie. This is one of the funniest movies ever. 10/10.,10,1,2,21 May 2007
