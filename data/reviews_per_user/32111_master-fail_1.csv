Come and See," the real meaning of horror
","Showing the passion of a boy in a very young age and how the situation creates that mentality for such a kid, is probably one of the main things that make this movie one of the most significant and effective movies of history.Great skill in showing the hardship of the time that had become part of everyday's people lives. moreover great way of showing how it feels to be in the same situation for the ones that never experience war time in their entire life. This movie made it easy for me to feel how the characters in the film were oppressed. Innocent people that had nothing to do with anything. With this movie i experienced what it means to not be free.",Null,1,1,15 June 2009
