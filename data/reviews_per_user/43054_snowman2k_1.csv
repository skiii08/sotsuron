The Avengers," Joss Whedon is a God
","Awesome is another word that should be in the title, Joss Whedon did the business with this film. Please do not do another as it will ruin a spectacular first outing.....nah i'm kidding roll on the next one. Plenty of action and laughs throughout the entire film. Make sure you stay past the initial credits for the extra scene which was no surprise when you have watched a few Marvel films. All the cast have plenty of on screen time and they did milk a scene and rightly so during about 2/3 in when the Destroyer weapon is used.Funniest bits were with the Hulk mainly punching people....Yah violence.",10,1,4,29 April 2012
