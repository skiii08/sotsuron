Black Swan," Black turkey
","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW* Wow, this movie was so laughably bad I couldn't believe it. Looks like really bad bad rip-off of Polanski's Repulsion and maybe Requiem for a dream. Characters talk and act like they are written by 13 year old boy who is deeply frustrated of still being a virgin. Scenes that were supposed to be scary just looked boring and predictable. I was expecting something truly nasty, but no.. Only disturbing thing in this is constant use of profanities and boringly stereotypical sexual clichés about female artists. Why they are always portrayed as weak, naive, psychologically imbalanced, and always under some sexual predatory of their much older mentor? OK, that was the case with Frida and Dora Maar, but this story is just getting annoying. And cruel 'Mother' in the movie obviously thought she was in some 'Carrie' sequel, and she was pretty bad at that. CGI was pure comedy gold, it like a movie turned into cartoon in that moment, it's really funny. I was just expecting Scooby Doo to turn up. The only thing that was worthy in this movie was Winona Ryder in her role of primaballerina, and even she was annoying with constant cursing. But the scene of her after accident, in the wheelchair, with her backs against Natalie Portman who brings some personal stuff to her, that scene was excellent! If the whole film was like this, it would be great, but it's not unfortunately.. Better watch Suspiria if you want a good horror movie with ballet dancers.",3,3,6,17 May 2013
Kick-Ass," Tarantino in kindergarten
","How is this movie rated so high is a complete mystery to me. I guess it's all because of poor taste of today's audience which gets so easily fascinated with anything that appears somehow 'inovative'. I was expected to see an excellent satire of geek's fascination with superheroes and some cleverly brought points and gegs, but what I get was just another stupid action-superhero movie with tons of unnecessary violence. Instead of introducing us more into Kick-ass character played by very likeble actor (he was the only reason why I watched this painful movie to the end), we become surrounded by clichés seen hundred times before in Tarantino movies, Watchmen, Incredibles, only with more added violence and gore. Right after the scene with drug dealers whole movie goes downhill, unable to decide what it wants to be: heartbreaking drama, bloody action movie or comedy? Besides all of that it becomes incredibly boring, just introducing more stupid evil characters, but the worst of all is that underaged 'superhero' girl which perfectly shows the creative and mental weakness of those behind this movie. Kickass's girlfriend is also a shameful cardboard cutout. Why does nobody know how to write female characters anymore? They are just extremely boring or extremely violent and swearing with sexual connotations! Miserable!",2,1,8,14 April 2013
A Clockwork Orange," Like a punch in the head
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***First time a saw 'A Clockwork orange', I just didn't know what to think about it. It left me utterly depressed and confused, felt like Kubrick just performed ultra-violence on my soul. I was 15 at that time (just like Alex deLarge), and I was watching it on some German channel without subtitles, with German synchronisation. I had no idea what kind of movie I was watching. Right from the beginning it was completely weird and dreamlike which was appealing but when the white gang went into that house with the big neon sign 'HOME' in front of it, a real horror begun. Because of that sign I thought Alex and his gang were going to his parents's house and those people inside really looked like some ordinary 'mum' and 'dad' in their leisure time. So when the infamous 'rape sequence' started, it was like a nightmare to me, felt like a movie went completely wrong at that point just for the sake of being shocking and disgusting in its literal attack on family, women and everything else. Some says it's a silly and entertaining scene. Well how about punk girls attacking pretty handsome males and then cutting their clothes and sexually humiliate them while singing 'Girls just want to have fun', because that is what they need to feel happy and be free? However, after this horrible atrocity, movie didn't get much better, just shock after shock after shock like a punch in the head, all with aggressive and tasteless visual style (thanks a lot, Kubrick). Behind that, I had to admit that composition of frames and use of music are some of the best I have ever seen on a film ( I own the soundtrack of ACO). It's so good it stucks forever into your head. But also got the feeling that the whole movie would be better with less hysterical and vulgar characters that are handled with some compassion, not just to appear in one scene and then disappear from the whole movie without a good reason (specially female characters, they are just horrible, hollow Playboy caricatures). Thanks to that the movie fails into some bad British comedy desperately trying to provoke with something that is known already. We all know that government is corrupted, police is violent, scientists are evil, youth is stupid and senseless and so on. It's nice and easy to accuse somebody else for our problems and behavior, but world will never change to something better because of that.It also looks like this film was purposely made to appeal to young men with not enough life experience(skinheads, punks and various kinds of geeks)with its untamed ugliness, cheap female nudity and expression of blind immature rage at the world that tries to restrain their wild instincts. But when one grow up into mature person, he can naturally perform this taming on himself. And that was the big Kubrick's mistake, to change the end of original story into something so banal like pure celebration of violence. And now Rob Zombie continues this path with his violent and awful characters in every single movie he made,'cause ultra-violence is so cool. What have you done Kubrick?:( And those sculptures in the movie.. so horribly tasteless, like lots of 'erotic' art from 70's anyway.",4,3,6,12 May 2013
