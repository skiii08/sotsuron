Changeling," Story based on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders
","This movie is based on a true story that occurred in L.A. in March of 1928. Christine Collins is a single mother of a young boy, Walter (Gattlin Griffith). Christen works as the supervisor of a large group of telephone operators while Walter attends school. One Saturday, when she had promised to take Walter to see a Charlie Chaplin movie, she is called into work to fill in for another sick employee. When she returns from work, Walter is no where to be found. She immediately calls the police, knowing that Walter is reliable and would call her if he had a reason not to be home. The police take her call but reject doing anything immediately: Walter had not been missing for more than 24 hours. After her request is made official, days (then weeks) go by as Walter remains missing.The media is informed and Christine's search for Walter becomes a famous case as newspapers and radio reporters won't let up on the police department's failure to find Walter. A local minister, Rev Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), who broadcasts on the radio and has some public clout, seems to be particularly interested in the 'widespread corruption of the LAPD.' He uses their lack of action in this case to further attack the LAPD. Weeks after Walter's disappearance, Christine receives news from the LAPD that Walter had been found with a drifter in Illinois and that he would be returning home safe and sound. When Christine goes to meet him at the train station, the boy who meets her is not Walter (even though he claims to be). After police Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) has the newspaper take a picture of Christine and her 'son,' he insists that she take him home in spite of her certainty that he is NOT Walter. Jones suggests that Walter's appearance may have changed and that Christine might be in a state of shock. When she continues to insist that the strange boy in her house is not Walter Dr. Earl W. Tarr (Peter Gerety), who regularly works with the police, tries to convince her that the new boy's shorter height and the fact that he is circumcised (Walter wasn't) all could be explained logically. As she continues to speak out, the police have her committed to an asylum.She is released when a young illegal immigrant, 14-year-old Sanford Clark (Eddie Alderson) is discovered at a nearby ranch. He is arrested for deportation back to Canada. But before deportation, Clark reveals that he was involved in a bizarre series murders (about twenty other boys). The alleged murderer is Clark's uncle, Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Hamer). (For more about the actual events, see 'Wineville Chicken Coop Murders' on Wikipeia.) Could Walter have been one of those murdered..or was he one of the two that got away..or was he still missing in another location? These are the issues that continue to be unfolded as the movie plays out.",8,2,3,3 December 2016
Frost_Nixon," Ron Howard introduces us to a new type of 'courtroom drama'
","If you're going to this movie thinking you are just going to see another movie about Watergate, you will have to quickly adjust your thinking. I know, because that is what happened to me. This is a riveting and gut- wrenching movie about two men locked in a personal battle to use each other in order to change their public images. Neither is totally prepared for the contest that will be played out on the world TV stage. To be sure, this is a 'no holds barred' showdown. But both Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) and David Frost (Michael Sheen who played Tony Blair in The Queen (2006) underestimate each other's public skills. To Nixon, David Frost is seen as just a second-rate British talk show host. To David Frost, the Nixon interviews are his ticket to do something that no other TV talk show host or reporter had managed to do: to get Nixon on record admitting something about himself that he had not heretofore publicly done. Frost, pushed by his fellow producers, wants Nixon to publicly take responsibility for the Watergate cover-up and for his own personal complicity in the final aspects of the Viet Nam War. As you watch this movie, you find yourself, at first, empathizing with David Frost who is in something big--but WAY over his head. Later, as you see the preparation for the interviews (on both sides), you feel empathyâ€”yes, empathy--for Richard Nixon!! Both Oliver Stone, in Nixon (1995), and Ron Howard, in this movie, seem to have taped Richard Nixon as a figure of the high tragedy akin to a figure from a Greek tragedy or one of the 'big four tragedies' of Shakespeare: Hamlet, Macbeth, Lear, and Othello. In each of these Shakespearian tragedies, the title character has an innate tragic flaw in their character that brings them down from great and powerful heights. While it may have been JEALOUSY with Othello or LUST FOR POWER with Macbeth, with Nixon it seems to always be the need for REVENGE on his enemies (real or imagined): those people that look down on him as socially or intellectually unworthy to hold power. With this movie, Ron Howard has expertly introduced us to a new type of 'courtroom drama.' But, this 'courtroom' takes the form of a series of TV interviews. The parties present their own arguments, and we are the jury. Howard effectively uses extreme close up shots to tighten the space and heighten the interpersonal drama. With his skill, Howard draws us into the drama and barely gives time to blink. Both my wife and I left the movie emotionally drained but dramatically fulfilled.",10,0,0,6 December 2016
Milk," Encouraging people to come out of the closet
","This is a biopic about Harvey Milk, a person I only remember through a news item---when he was killed along with San Francisco Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garber). Their assassin, Dan White (Josh Brolin), will probably be best remembered for the 1979 trial in which his attorney tried to use something that would later be known as the 'Twinkie defense.' As the movie begins, Harvey Milk (Sean Penn), is on the verge of his 40th birthday and feels that he has done nothing with his life. He meets his partner and soon-to-be campaign manager, Scott Smith (James Franco), in a NYC subway station. They move to San Francisco and open a camera shop in the predominately gay district called the Castro. Harvey becomes a gay-rights activist and attempts to run for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. After three attempts, and much work to politically organize his district, he is elected as the first openly gay candidate ever to be elected in America (in 1977). During his political career, he encourages a large number of people to come out of the closet and declare their gayness openly. After seeing this movie, I put the 1984 documentary, The Times of Harvey Milk, at the top of my Netflix queue since I wanted to see more about Milk and see how well Penn portrays him in this movie. The only thing that I don't look forward to is Harvey Fierstein's narration: I don't like his grading voice. In any case, Sean Penn gives a natural, and convincing performance.",9,0,2,8 December 2016
Pan's Labyrinth," A grim and magical story of a young girl
","When movies are very good—especially foreign language movies—I like to see them twice to fill in plot details the second time, after basically reading subtitles the first time. So, when it came to our local theater, I watched it twice—consecutively—and I think it was well worth the time to pay for it once and see it twice. It is nominated for Best Foreign Language Film (from Mexico) although it was filmed in Spain, about Spain, with an all-Spanish cast (with the brilliant exceptions of Mexican director and screenwriter, del Toro and American actor Doug Jones who plays both Pan (the fawn) and the pale man.The movie tells a grim and magical story of a young girl, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), who is forced to move to rural Spain in 1944 after the Spanish Civil War in which her father had been killed while fighting against Franco. As the movie begins, Ofelia and her pregnant mother are traveling to a rural outpost to join her mother's second husband, Capitán Vidal (Sergi López). Vidal is one of Franco's officers who is posted at the outpost to command and control the heavy resistance still being waged by anti-Franco forces. Ofelia's mother is having a troubled pregnancy and is forced to spend most of her time in bed. Ofelia has no children her age to play with but is cared for by Vidal's housekeeper, Mercedes (Maribel Verdú). Most importantly, Ophelia is emerged in her books of magical fairy tales: her real surroundings are so brutal that her imagination easily takes her to living in her fairy tale world. The movie takes us back and forth between the real world around Ophelia and the imaginary one that she had created. Both can be dark and treacherous. However, the only one that she has any control over is her imaginary one. So, she is devoted to the missions in that world.Ophelia 'enters' the imaginary world through a maze-like labyrinth (suggested by the ruins of an old mill on the outpost). But once she enters, she can easily get lost without guidance and instructions. Her guide is a giant fawn, Pan (Doug Jones), who instructs her how to open doors, find creatures, and confront them. Pan also instructs her what tasks to carry out as well as what dangers to be aware of in her endeavors. Ophelia is given three critical tasks to be carried out by a certain time and according to Pan's rules. Breaking the rules could lead to catastrophe, but she must make her own choices too. To help her carry out her quests, she is given small dragonfly-like fairies to guide her. The fairies are not only her friends but they help point out possible problems with their gestures and reactions.Interspersed with these quests, we see Ophelia's life in the real world. Her stepfather is brutal and sadistic. Before questioning someone, he often gives a prelude in which he brandishes his instruments of torture. However, just as Ophelia is given choices in her imaginary world, so too are the adults in the real world. They can fight, resist, give in, or not respond to threats and pay the consequences. This movie is well-conceived and presented. Also, the artwork and special effects are remarkable. However, it really isn't fit for children in spite of its fairy tale themes. Ophelia's imaginary world is no more scary or dark than what we might see in a good Harry Potter movie—a hug toad throwing up a ball of mucus to find a sticky hidden key, etc. However, the adult world is TOO real and violent for innocent children and some adults. Still, both real and the imaginary worlds must exist together to make the movie effective: the movie is conceived as an interplay between the two worlds, so you can't have one without the other. What we are left with is a good movie with audience limitations. It's a dilemma, but there you have it...",9,1,1,24 November 2016
Fargo," Let's make a deal
","This movie was nominated for several Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (William H. Macy). It won Oscars for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Frances McDormand) and Best Writing (the Coen Brothers).Fargo is certainly one of the Coen's finest and most famous movies. It claims to faithfully relate a true story that occurred between Fargo, North Dakota and Minnesota's Twin Cities in the late 1960s. The real story is anything but funny. But, this movie has its share of both humor and of black humor. The movie begins in Fargo as Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is making contact with two 'professional' thugs to arrange for his own wife's kidnapping. Jerry, a car dealer from Minneapolis, with big personal money problems, wants his wife kidnapped because he knows his father-in-law is very wealthy and will pay the ransom for his own daughter. The idea is that once his father-in-law pays off the thugs and his wife is released, and he can split the ransom with the thugs. HOWEVER, once the deal is made and Jerry gives them one of the cars off of the lot, things start to go downhill when the quitter of the two thugs kills a policeman for stopping them to ask why the car has no tags. The killing of the policeman leads to two other passersby being killed. After this triple homicide, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), a pregnant cop is called into the case. As the movie develops—and the kidnapping scheme unravels—we are entertained by both the stories and characterizations of Marge's friends and family as well as Jerry Lundegaard's constantly frustrating and deteriorating predicament(s).",9,1,2,9 December 2016
Little Miss Sunshine," Not your typical trip to a beauty pageant.
","As the movie opens Sheryl (Toni Collette) is picking up her brother, Frank (Steve Carell), from a mental hospital, after his failed suicide attempt due to a recent breakup with his boyfriend. Sherl's husband, Richard (Greg Kinnear), is bankrupt and trying to create a new career for himself as a motivational speaker. When Sheryl brings Frank into her home, he is forced--after being discharged from the hospital--to bunk with their son, Dwayne (Paul Dano). Dwayne is in the midst of a self-induced vow of silence in partial preparation for his goal of getting into the Air Force Academy.The rest of the household consists of Richard's incorrigible father, Alan Arkin—who has been kicked out of Sunset Manor--and Sheryl and Richard's seven-year-old daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin).With the dream of someday becoming a beauty contestant. Olive has been working on her talent routine with grandpa. When she learns that the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California has an opening, she wants to compete.The adventure begins when the entire family reluctantly gets into their old bright yellow VW bus to go from Albuquerque to LA. As the trip progresses, everyone becomes increasingly committed to getting Olive to the contest on time. The mishaps along the way are unexpected and interesting. But, this is no National Lampoon-like vacation-type movie.The movie gives us an irreverent jab at child beauty contests and presents us with grandpa's sage advice to his dysfunctional family--- concisely shouted to his grandson, Dwayne while on the trip—'Screw every woman you can get your hands on!!' (But, he didn't use the word, 'screw.') (Olive has her music headset on so she is the only one in the bus that isn't within earshot of grandpa's advice.) The cute seven-year-old Olive wins your heart over as she helps to bring her family together by trying to do the impossible: win the Little Miss Sunshine contest without any rehearsals.I'm not sure if this Sundance-sponsored movie is destined to become a classic. But, I found it to be entertaining and fun. Much of its humor is irreverent or gallows humor, and I found myself laughing out loud many times. I think that one of its greatest assets is its unpredictability. I guess I am not alone in my love for this movie. It has also won several critical acclaims, in several categories",8,2,3,26 November 2016
Dreamgirls," More than a musical and less than an opera
","This is more than a musical and less than an opera. Since most—that is a HUGE part—of it is related through music rather than dialogue, I don't know what category to place it in. Perhaps that fact alone is what makes me feel ambivalent about it. So, let's just call it a new sub-genre of musically related story telling..It basically relates the story of Motown from the early 60s through the mid-70s (with a slight bit on the disco craze of that period). When I stop to think of it, the story of Motown is not only important to America's Musical and Performing Arts history, it is also highly entertaining in this format.The story is told through several interacting sub-stories with at least three great male stars: Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, and Danny Glover. Foxx plays the heavy as he lures in talented young girls and then controls their careers and their lives by making them perform his way--in his media and venue, and with his choice of songs. Further, he can not only make them stars but he can break them too. While Foxx plays the heavy (Satan figure), Danny Glover plays the old-man-with-a-big-heart role (the angel figure). Glover's character helps them start their careers; picks them up when they are down; and tries to get them together or make a comeback. Finally, Eddie Murphy plays the role of the Jester. He is a lovable fool who doesn't seem to know his talent or its limitations. He also doesn't know himself too well either. The four 'Dreamgirls' all have different stories in the movie. Although I am not familiar with them as actresses, they are all great singers. Of course, all eyes this year are on newcomer, Jenifer Hudson, for her role as Effie White. Still, Beyoncé Knowles, Anika Noni Rose, and Sharon Leal are great as the other three dreamgirls.",7,0,1,28 November 2016
Jackie," Jackie striped bare and alone
","This movie received 3 Oscar nominations, and I am having a hard time finding another actress who gives us the kind of performance that Natalie Portman does here. I was also very impressed with the movie's score by Mica Levi which really set the grime tone of the story in the movie. What we have here is something that may be unique movie-making. It takes a well-known and well-covered story of the Kennedys and focuses it on Jackie, herself. As one watches this movie, one realizes that--after 50 years with countless articles, movies, and documentaries about John F. Kennedy, his family, his administration, and his assassination--we still didn't have anything that focused in on Jackie and what she had to suddenly endure in front of the whole world. Here, we see Jackie striped bare and alone. Accented by the dysphoric chords of the movie's score, we see Jackie as a famous person with no one to really lean on. The camera constantly shows Jackie as an isolated, often silly, figure trying hopelessly to make sense of her role in the drama unfolding around her. What should she do? How can she help to make the Kennedy legacy last and be understood in the most positive way? While Bobby (Peter Sarsgaard), does make an appearance in the movie, he does not seem to always understand what SHE is going through: packing up the belongings of the White House so that the Johnsons can movie in; taking care of the children; and making decisions about the funeral. This is clearly Natalie Postman's movie, and although you may not like her vocal cadence and tone, you see and hear a person trying to maintain a sense of dignity in a private world of chaos. As Jack Valenti (Max Casella) moves into the White House, Jackie becomes a stranger in a strange world. The late John Hurt is also featured in this movie as Jackie's priest who tries to help her makes sense of life. Although his part is small, it is important to the story.",10,1,4,7 February 2017
Blood Diamond," Three characters from different backgrounds USE each other for very different goals
","My first impression of the movie was that Leonardo DiCaprio was not deep enough and that he was just trying to force out a tough version of Indiana Jones.---WRONG! His role as a South African diamond smuggler, Danny Archer, evolves into a very full and complex character with a very important story to be told. Other first impressions about the expected stereotypical roles of the Western journalist, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) and the native Sierra Leonean fisherman, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) turn out to be equally wrong as the movie unfolds and the nature of their roles becomes more apparent.These three central characters—from totally different backgrounds--meet under unusual circumstances, but they all eventually need and explicitly USE each other to achieve their very different goals.The story behind the 1990s civil war in Sierra Leon is told here in an enlightening and entertaining way. After seeing the movie, I was prompted to Google more details about the West African location of Sierra Leon and the actual history behind the civil war there. As an interesting side-line, Best Supporting Actor nominee, Djimon Hounsou was born in the nearby country of Benin.",8,1,1,29 November 2016
La La Land," Basic girl-meets-boy movie with a bittersweet ending
","This is up for 14 nominations and is bound to walk away with the lion's share of Oscars. It was a pleasant movie, but did not reach the level of greatness for me that it has for others here. It is a basic girl-meets- boy movie with a bittersweet ending. There is not a song from the movie that I came out humming or singing. If Emma Stone wins for Best Actress in this movie, it would only show me how weak this the category may be this year. (But, I haven't seen Arrival or Elle so I don't know about these movies.) As I watched this movie, I did think about Les parapluies de Cherbourg (1964), but that movie was a modern opera and La La Land (2016) comes no where near that great Michel Legrand work of yesteryear.",7,0,5,7 February 2017
The Last King of Scotland," Where did this dictator come from. and what made him tick?
","Try to imagine what it might be like if you were a Western European and witnessed—from the inside--the beginning and development of one of the most notoriously brutal African dictators of the 20th Century. What might it have looked like to you? This is exactly what Giles Foden did when he wrote his fictionalized historical novel, The Last King of Scotland. In writing his novel, Foden gives us a chance to try to get into the regime of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin and get an up close and personal look at this brutal clownish figure from the 1970s. Like Hitler or Jim Jones, there is a curiosity to know more about where such people come from and what makes them tick. Call it morbid, but nevertheless, it is still there. In the movie version of the novel, Scottish director Kevin Macdonald--principally known for his documentary, Touching the Void (2003)--shapes Foden's novel and brings it to life.As the movie opens c.1970, a young Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), is fresh out of medical school but feels that he will always live in his father's shadow unless he breaks from the family and practices medicine far away. Seeking to make a difference, he chooses to practice in the underdeveloped African country of Uganda. Nicholas starts to work in a free clinic with another white doctor and his wife, Sarah Merrit (Gillian Anderson). When he hears about a local coup, he thinks it would be interesting to go to town and see a rally with the new leader. Nicholas and Sarah go to the planned demonstration where they see Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) addressing a large crowd. On their way back to the clinic, he is stopped on the road by the local authorities because Amin is in need of medical help. While he is treating Amin's injured hand, the two make a connection. Amin becomes interested in the way Nicholas handles himself and admires Nicholas' tee-shirt with the word, 'Scotland' on it. He wants to trade his uniform for Nicholas' tee-shirt. The fact that both identify with the Scots and dislike the English is something they have in common.Shortly thereafter, Amin sends his limo to pick up Nicholas, gives him a tour of his palace, and meets his wives and children. Then, in a jovial way, he asks him to become his personal doctor, and offers to let him run Uganda's top clinic in Kampala. Nicholas accepts and abruptly leaves the clinic. As he enters into Amin's social functions and is taken into Amin's confidence, Amin starts to call him 'his personal adviser.' Nicholas' naivete is no match for Amin's charm, and he is soon ensnared into Amin's inner circle. Soon, British agents are asking Nichols to 'keep in touch' if there in anything that they should know; Nichols scoffs at the idea of informing on Amin.As Amin's personal doctor, Nicholas notices his growing paranoia. But, living in a somewhat cloistered life, Nicholas doesn't realize the brutality of what is going on in the country. It's only when he is personally degraded that he discovers some of Amin's atrocities. And, it is only when he becomes the object of that brutality—as a result of an affair with one of Amin's many wives--that he personally experiences it.What's amazing to me about this movie is that—until the very end—there is little violence to portend what is really happening in the country. We know—though Nicholas' eyes---that Amin is concerned about his world image. We know that he is negotiating about Palestinian and Israeli hostages from a hijacked airplane. But, the movie only skims the surface of these important historical issues, because that is not really what the movie is about. It's about the relationship between a naive personal adviser (later called a 'personal monkey') and the web of deceit spun by the brutal sociopath that controls him.'The death toll during Amin's regime will never be accurately known. An estimate from the International Commission of Jurists is that it was not less than 80,000, and more likely around 300,000. Another estimate, compiled by exile organizations with the help of Amnesty International, put the number killed at 500,000.'--Quoted from WikipediaIt's important to note that the time frame of this fictionalized story is from 1971 to the incident at Entebbe in 1976, and Amin's regime was to last until he was deposed in 1979. What we really don't know--and can't know from the above quote--is the time pattern of Amin's ordered tortures and killings: What would a time chart would look like, with TIME as the X-Axis and KILLINGS AND TORTURES as the Y-Axis? From this chart you could see: 1) Did these killings and tortures start gradually and grow over time? 2) Did they occur at a constant rate throughout his regime? 3) Were they concentrated more in the later years of his rule? 4) Were there any external events that triggered when they occurred?Since we can only estimate the raw numbers, we are even FURTHER afield as to the pattern of their occurrence. When you factor in that we are seeing a fictional account of Amin though the eyes of a cloistered and naive white Western European, what you are left with is a story of what might have happened. Again, I say that the movie and novel are more about the relationship between Garrigan and Amin than what I suggested at the beginning of the review: the witness and experience—from the inside--of Amin's entire regime.Does this movie give us more insight into the mind or motives of Amin? Probably not. But, Forest Whitaker gives us a powerful portrayal of this historic figure. Whitaker could have overplayed Amin, but he didn't. His portrayal seems right on the mark!!",8,0,0,28 November 2016
The Queen," Helen Mirren's Oscar-winning role
","This movie gives us a look at what things might have been like at the time when Lady Di was killed in a car accident in Paris. Helen Mirren gives an excellent portrayal of Queen Elizabeth. She is so convincing as the queen that one soon is able to easily suspend any disbelief that she is NOT the queen. Helen Mirren--whom I have enjoyed since her Shakespeare work in the late 60s early 70s---won a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar for this role.Another 'dead on' performance is that of Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. The movie starts with the moment when Blair first had his first awkward audience with the queen. It then skips forward to the time when Diana was killed. As the royal family vacations in Scotland, Blair's problem is how to convince the queen that she must return to London to acknowledge the grief of the people and finally have a large public funeral rather than a small private one. This is a case of the royal family not knowing HOW to react under such unusual circumstances. Blair, plus public sentiment, helps her to realize what should be done.",9,0,0,26 November 2016
The Thin Red Line," Gives us something beyond what we have come to expect from a movie
","As I continue my journey of experiencing Terrence Malick movies, I see that this one is almost as indispensable as The Tree of Life (2011), which still stands alone in terms of asking questions about life and its meaning. After making beautiful movies such as Badlands (1973) and Days of Heaven (1978), Malick seems to have taken another path with his movies. These movies give us something beyond what we have come to expect from a movie. They use beautiful photography, but they also use a new element of internal dialogue (through voice over) within the characters— wondering and questioning meaning. While using the movie as a vehicle, they give us questions without clear-cut answers and leave us to think way beyond the usual surface level of life. The questions may, or may not, be deep, but they do exist within characters' minds, if only in passing. This great (mostly young) male cast only helps to make the movie better. This movie—based on James Jones' autobiographical novel--is set in WW II as US soldiers try to retake territory occupied by Japan. The movie received seven Oscar nominations.",9,1,3,25 November 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," WOW, what a movie!!!
","We just saw this yesterday as it was about to leave town. WOW, what a movie and what a story!!! It has been nominated for 6 Oscars and seems a deserving candidate in all of those categories. Will Mel Gibson finally get his directorial Oscar for this? If so, if wouldn't disappoint me a bit. I was extremely impressed with Andrew Garfield's performance as Desmond Doss. He comes across as genuine to the character he played. The movie may have a few too much pyrotechnics during that battle scenes. But, on the other hand, I think they were necessary to make this real-life hero's actions come to life. And, the battle scenes are well-balanced with Doss's background story. I can only think of 2 other movies that portray Metal of Honor winners: To Hell and Back and Sergeant York. And, this movie compares favorably to those movies. The story rings true about a real World War II war hero who refused to carry a gun in battle- -ever.",8,3,8,7 February 2017
The Pursuit of Happyness," True story about a man driven to survive & keep his son from seeing the harshness that surrounds them
","This movie--based on a true story--concerns a man's struggle to juggle his time, his job, his marriage, his debts, and his aspirations to be a stockbroker. But above and beyond anything else, he wants to be a great father to his 5-year-old son. He wants to be the father that HE never had and always wanted. But, how can one man do all this when he (and his son) are driven from their apartment into the streets and forced to live in public bathrooms and churches? How can he live like this and still keep his son from feeling this trauma too. The answer seems to be imagination, bluffing, and a lot of love. This is a man driven to survive and keep his son from seeing the harshness that surrounds them. While watching this movie, I was reminded of Life is Beautiful in which Guido Orefice tries to make his son think that living in a concentration camp is fun. But here, homelessness and fear replace the concentration camp of LIB. If there is one image of this movie that will remain with me forever, it will be that of Will Smith running, always running against the odds, through the streets of San Francisco.",7,0,0,30 November 2016
