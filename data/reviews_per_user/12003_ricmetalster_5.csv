The Incredible Hulk," Mind-numbingly boring
","Same screenplay/plot/tropes we've seen hundreds of times. What a boring movie. Maybe It would have excited me if it had been released in 1985. But man, not for a 2008 movie. And to see it in 2019? What a booooore.",4,0,0,12 August 2019
The Hunger Games," waste
","Honestly, they would have done the world a favor by feeding the poor, as opposed to making this movie. Seriously, who allows money to be spent?So much is bad with this movie. It is poor in execution and nearly every other aspect a movie can fail on. The only exception being the idea behind the film, which can always be saved / turned into an amazing movie when there's a good director/writer/screen-adapter.This movie could be 10 minutes long and it would have probably been better that it was, seeing the level of boredom peeks from a 10 to a 3 in 2.0 seconds.I only hope the following movies make this a watch-worth franchise because this movie alone cannot even be used to wipe ass.I'll say one or two good points about the visuals. There is a nice forest and a well designed futuristic city. That's it. And a cute girl. The rest is just awful.",3,8,11,26 June 2014
Thor: Ragnarok," Quirkier action/comedy and it's OK!
","Thor: Ragnarok is a quirkier action/comedy movie. And it is OK!It's what we've seen from the comedy-injected Marvel movies. Thor:Ragnarok goes a little bit further though, and take itself a bit less serious. And it's OK!There's action, story, comedy. The whole shebang!What this movie did is not make you bored, ever. And it is OK!That said, I'm not a comic book connoisseur. Just come to better know the Marvel universe from the movies.Been reading negative reviews about character, seriousness of the movie, and it seems to me that these reviewers (who give 1/10) are people who have serious expectations for a movie. In no way does this movie deserve a 1/10. There's so much in it to NOT deserve this rating. Movies CAN be easy to watch and provide entertainment.",9,2,4,5 July 2018
Suicide Squad," Nothing new - not even current.
","I went into this movie hoping for something on the lines on a newer look at superheroes, like something Christopher Knolan brought - some seriousness and maturity to the theme. What i got was a look back at old, beaten, tried and pop-cultured turd of a superhero movie.With the vibe of this 90's movies explained (yes, this was filmed in the 90's - i am sure of it), let me get down to the story line, which also follows a beaten, tired and old trope where something goes bad and they manage to get a gang of misfits to fight together for a greater good. Now, i don't want to go into this subject because frankly it's just too old, boring and quite frankly an insult to movie goers in this day and age.Now for the direct attacks to this pile of Sunday afternoon excuse for a movie.1 - What is Will Smith doing on the screen? We had enough of him already, not to mention he is reprising roles that have come to outgrow him. His last shot was Hancock, a tired, old and beaten down drunk of a hero. He should have stayed down. Bo-ring!2- These are villains. They are not renegade heroes turned good again. You murdered these villains.The *only* thing good to come out of this movie is Harley Quinn. Loved the actor and the love story with the (trying not to laugh at how mundane the Joker was) her love.To finish i'll just say; Wow, what a re-polished piece of crap of a movie, definitely not a new look at anything!",5,1,2,21 December 2016
A Quiet Place," Good production, a bit underwhelming.
",Some horror movies have interesting events in between the horror bits. I found this movie got me bored when there wasn't much going on in the way of horror.,5,0,0,24 April 2020
