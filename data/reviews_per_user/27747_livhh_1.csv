The Lobster," Perfect
","Amazing metaphor.
It draws parallels between the absurdity of the arbitrary relationship norms and rules that exist in its world and our world. It asks bigger philosophical questions about the nature of relationships: what love actually is, what marriage actually means, what it means to be free (he was neither free being forced to be in a couple, nor was he free as a 'loner' - both sides were equally oppressive) - this begs the question of why we have to be in conventional relationships and not acknowledge changes in relationships. It sheds light on the very black and white nature of society's expectations.
He remarks in the first half something about 'is it easier to pretend you dont care when you do, than to pretend that you care when you dont'.
I thought it was interesting that in the whole movie there was a strong theme of lack of loyalty. Most interestingly, rachel (1) tells the loner leader that they could have blinded him instead of her and (2) at the end she lies to him about it heightening your senses in an attempt to make him do it - and when he responds 'i know' (he has seen her mistake a tennis ball for a kiwi fruit) i think he sort of realises the flawed nature of their relationship - the only relationship in the movie that was momentarily real.
In the end, i think she doesnt want to be blind and alone and turned into an animal, and it begs the question that if she really loved him, would she want him to cut out his eyes? I think the answer is no.
This movie will annoy you if you need a resolution, as this is more of a fascinating exploration of this fictional world.",10,1,2,1 January 2019
