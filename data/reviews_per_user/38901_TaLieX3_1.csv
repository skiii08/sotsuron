The Sound of Music," Based on the Maria Von Trapps's memoir
","The hills are alive with the sound of music! The timeless classic seems to always capture hearts everywhere and take a hold of audiences and their emotions. Sound Of Music is a sweet romantic movie with variety and a beautiful storyline. The story takes place in Austria around the 1930's.A young woman by the name of Maria(Julie Andrews) is trying to become a nun but miserably failing at each attempt, that is when the convent receives a letter from Navy captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), asking for a governess that can take care of his 7 children. Maria is given the job in hope to do better..The captain's wife is dead and he is often away. The children keep managing to run off the former governesses and have resentment towards Maria at first, but her kindness, understanding and fun loving nature win the children's approval and the captain's. The home is run by a strict hand; much like the captain runs the ship he sails on, but as Maria spends time with the family, the home soon changes into a happier household and music is brought back into the family's life.As time goes on, the captain and the governess both fall in love with each other and end up getting married. The whole family now must escape Austria, so that the captain won't be forced to fight for Germany. The decision tears the family because of their strong nationalism, but gets them closer to one another.The movie is based on a real story and a real family, who escaped Austria during Nazi control. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer really portrayed the essence of the family and their situation. The movie overall was very heart warming and a classic to watch. I found the cinematography to be outstanding and breath-taking, showing off Austria's beauty in many frames and a joy to watch.I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie. It has everything you want from a movie, tragedy, comedy, romance, and a message. The film is very moving and hard to forget.",8,2,9,18 May 2009
