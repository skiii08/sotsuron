Walk the Line," Somewhat disappointing
","Well, saw the film this evening, and I have to say that I was really looking forward to it, being a bit of a JC fan.And my impressions are... well, certainly well acted, both the lead actors give excellent performances. The songs are pretty well reproduced, and there are some tender moments.And yet, and yet ... well, it really did feel rather formulaic, and the JC character really was pretty well sanitised for the (US) public. I would like to have seen the real Cash, I'm pretty sure we didn't see it.The other complaint is, why such brief examination of the JC career ? He was still making good records in the 1990s, and the 2000s. Listen to 'Personal Jesus' if you don't believe me. I was expecting to see the visit to the Holy Land, his baptism, the lean years in the 1990s. None of that is covered. Shame.In summary, I really believe that one can glean more about the 'Man in Black' by listening to the later recordings, than from watching this film, although it does add something to the legend.Entertaining, but maybe one day somebody will make the REAL J Cash movie.",Null,1,2,20 February 2006
Moulin Rouge!," Oh dear, oh dear oh dear...
","Oh dear, oh dear oh dear... where does one start ? Bit of a film fan... but this one, well, one of the worst I have ever seen..Absolute, complete rubbish. Just what were the thinking ? It is a horrible mixture of bad pop songs, poor story telling and a very weak story line. It gets worse the long one watches it. Kiss songs, U2 songs, gawd this really is a mess.What a dreadful waste of money, of actors and of just about everything else.Seen a few bad films in my time, but this may be the very worst.In a word, it's 'merde'.An embarrassment for all concerned.I am amazed that the makers managed to sit through the final screening without cringing with embarrassment.",1,38,69,21 October 2006
