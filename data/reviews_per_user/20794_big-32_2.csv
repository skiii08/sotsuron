The Monuments Men," Saving Private Ryan's socks or Indiana Clooney and the Temple of Dull
","Have you ever watched paint dry ? Well I've just watched something even duller. During the film three people in the lower rows walked out this was a great disappointment for me because one of them was playing angry birds on his iPhone , that was far more interesting than what was on the screen. The film is really just twaddle , dull, barely any story , no intrigue just clooney and his chums wandering about finding art .It goes like this ; we think some stolen art is there , shall we go there ? , OK we're here where is the stolen art ? It's over there , Well done Chums lets go and find some more stolen art , the Nazis are such rotters The cast barely bothered to act , I don't blame them , they had nothing to work with ,Just drive about , look a bit glum at times , be happy when more stolen art is found Then repeat until the End If you go to watch this do yourself a favour , take a fully charged iPhone with angry birds on it , the rest of the cinema goers will thank you , just don't walk out halfway through and leave the poor souls with nothing but the Monuments Men to watch",2,4,7,6 March 2014
The Woman in Black," woman in yawn
","I was truly disappointed with this, got bored after 20mins, it was really just a ride on a fairground ghost train , made you jump but that gets tiresome for 95mins,maybe the constant close ups on Daniel Radcliffe looking like a perplexed Emu didn't help but the storyline was just feeble ,at no point did I care what happened, just waited for the next jump. the little dog was quite sweet but even he got bored and disappeared halfway through,yep gone , a constant companion for Mr Jerome and Mr Kipp's (Radcliffe) and then nothing , maybe had a better offer from his agent or just ran off to join a circus. a true reflection of the film if a cast member scarpers off midway!sadly for me , the film wasted itself in the constant attempts to make add another jump.in all a dull tedious film with jumpy bits thrown in,",2,14,23,25 February 2012
