Black Swan," Stunning. Scary.
","Powerful. Stunning. Scary. Stupid, ignorant, jealous has-been wannabe ballerina mother. This mother smothers. She dresses Nina like she is an infant. I wondered if the mother has sexual designs on the daughter. She tucks her daughter into bed. The daughter is a four-year veteran of an urban ballet company, going from the corps-de-ballet to apparently superstar status, but the mother whines, cries, coddles, torments and emotionally blackmails Nina.Nina must have been off the deep end from the beginning. All the violence, blood and nightmarish scenes were from the intense pressure under which she toiled. Thomas was an arrogant S.O.B., who hoped to awaken Nina's repressed sexuality, but this passage was marked by Nina's imagined lezzie-wet-dream. This 'dream' propelled Nina to get into the black swan personality, and IMO her eye makeup as well as costuming were stunning, not to mention the black wings and bow/curtsey she takes as the triumphant Black Swan.I do love dance movies. If the principal actresses were not technically lifelong-trained ballerinas, this is the movies, folks. Yes, professionals did the actual long-shot dancing. Yes, the facial closeups were of the principals. This is 'movie magic'. Stuntpersons have long had a corner on this market.Nina's descent into madness was painful to watch. Was this further exacerbated by the drug pills, or was this part just another foray into Nina's troubled psyche? I even thought Nina would commit violence against Dear Old Mama. Exactly what was that big dark club for? Surely Mama's big mouth could have been shut up permanently; Mama was just itchin' for a big slammin' in the pie hole.The Red Shoes: Vicky becomes #1 Cheese when Russian ballerina storms off to get married. Vicky is loved by the director, but he is gay. Vicky has replaced the prima ballerina, and Nina smacks of this. Nina has won the prize of Swan Queen, but is greeted by 'WHORE' written in lipstick on the bathroom mirror. Is this real, or in her mind? It's hard to tell, in 'Black Swan'. Nina has won this big prize, but we are soon set up for the jealousies and nasty comments to follow. Nina has to look over her shoulder a lot...... Was one of the bar guys the Mad Hatter from 'Once Upon A Time'?More Red Shoes: Vicky puts on the red pointe shoes, in the play within a play, and all of a sudden the shoes control her outside life. The shoes make her dance to her death, as she falls off a parapet onto the tracks of an oncoming train. Nina is obsessed; Swan Queen controls her life. She will kill, to keep her part. At least, we think so. Maybe the one she killed was herself, because in the end a shard of glass in her abdomen has caused tons of bleeding. She lies on the mattress underneath a white ceiling. Is she dead? Is she in Heaven? Is she going there soon?",10,2,4,31 March 2013
The Sound of Music," Kids ran off previous governesses
","The kids ran off previous governesses.  Kids are precocious and restless. Sound of Music?  No.  'Mary Poppins', another Julie Andrews favorite of mine.  Julie embodies Maria in 'Sound of Music'?  Yes, but even better, because Julie is much prettier than the original.  Father a gruff commander who's really softer deep down.  Yes, but so is the king in 'The King & I'. Even with all the similarities, I like this movie.  I really like the dance where Liesl & Rolf are in the gazebo during the rainfall, singing 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen'.  When I see old brocade curtains, I think of Maria/Julie making matching 'ugggly' clothing for all the children, even the boys!  My boys would not wear those clothes to a dogfight!  However, it works for this movie.  Good thing Maria taught the kids to sing.  Didn't that become their livelihood when they got to this country, in real life?",Null,0,5,23 September 2002
Finding Neverland," Wonderful Movie
","12/10.I always love everything about James M. Barrie, Peter Pan, Charles Frohman, and Maude Adams (Peter's first American portrayer, and not depicted here). Add to that list Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp plus Julie Christie (ah yes, the beautiful 'Lara' from Doctor Zhivago').I saw this movie twice last night; our opening night. I am watching 'Hook' on TV now. Just played my CD from movie 'Peter Pan 2003'. What can I say? 'Finding Neverland' is just awesome. For a long time, I have been waiting for it to be released. I hope to get it later on DVD and/or video.When Sylvia goes to Neverland/Heaven, it is such a beautiful scene instead of her being afraid. She is so brave and happy, and in actuality terminally ill. She is so totally touched by the beauty of this 'Eden'. There are exotic animals; some danced by ballerinas beautifully costumed. They are winged incredible fairies. The most beauteous of all are the young and elegant fairies, who carry Sylvia's train as she enters Neverland dressed in a beautiful gown. Then fade to black and the cemetery scene with everybody dressed in Edwardian black mourning clothing. This austere ending to such a beautiful jungle atmosphere: should get an award for making the audience gasp with total surprise.Hoffman is great as Frohman (at same time, I was thinking about him in 'The Graduate' as a very young man). I read, however, that IRL Charles Frohman was enthusiastic about 'Peter Pan', and certainly never had any money problems in real life (he managed several theaters and many big stars) -- but that Barrie was skeptical and offered Frohman a backup play if 'Peter Pan' was not successful. Ah well. Frohman, Barrie and Maude Adams (the first American Peter, as stated above) made a fortune from 'Peter Pan', and in America Peter Pan played in New York and toured the U.S. through 1915 -- when Frohman was killed in the sinking of the ship Lusitania.The kids were wonderful, especially Peter (who later in life committed suicide from all the comparisons to Peter Pan). Kelly Macdonald was just superb, and so sweet. Johnny Depp superbly underplayed Barrie, who in real life has been depicted as almost a lowlife. Mary Ansell Barrie probably deserved Gilbert Cannan. Maybe she never deserved James Matthew Barrie. Maybe bad things written about Barrie were written by jealous wannabes who didn't achieve his fame and respect: he became a Baronet and Chancellor of his university; several of his plays were made into movies in the 1930s, and 'Peter Pan' has been made into several movies and continues to be produced as stage shows and ballets. And who hasn't heard of Peter Pan Peanut Butter?For a villainess, Julie Christie is up there with the good and believable ones. I also enjoyed her in 'Troy' this year as Achilles' (Brad Pitt's) mother. Kate Winslet is always so divine; 'Titanic' and 'Sense and Sensibility' -- and now 'Finding Neverland'. I always have read that Barrie became guardian of her five (not four) sons, and with no mention of her mother with dual guardianship. The dog was a hoot, especially the actor portraying him.A++",10,0,0,25 November 2004
Gravity," Houston, do you read me?
","The good: Strong woman. She apparently outlived George Clooney's character. Great crash-'em-up scenarios. She prays to God to save her life. There is also a Buddha-like statue over the cockpit/dashboard. Maybe both God and nuBuddha save her life. She can really click that helmet back on her suit just in the nick of time. She can really 'swim' through the environment on those spacecrafts.The bad: What's the matter with these people? With international space stations, the characters should learn the languages of astronauts/cosmonauts from other nations and cultures. Barking of a dog? Woof, woof, woof? What was up with that? Mayday-mayday was foreign to an Asian person, so there should have been an international SOS 'word or phrase' that was recognizable to all involved.More bad: No singing and dancing. Seriously, let me see what else this turkey lacked . . . Realism about all the body slams. Yes, Dr. Stone was slammed against all of that enormous equipment, out in space, yet she survived with merely a bruise -- lots of other people got killed. She all of a sudden miraculously found oxygen when she had been inhaling her own breath. Clooney appeared to her, and inspired her to stay on the alive side of the hereafter.Worse: Clooney, something like, 'You like my looks?' Another scene, something like, 'You want to stay aboard here with me and have a 'good time' all day?' I tell you, this is such ignorant and disrespectful dialogue. Clark Gable he ain't, nor Cary Grant, et al.The itchy; the so-so: all those tethers tangled around her legs. Reminded me of that old time ping pong toy with the red rubber ball attached to the thin wooden paddle by way of a long gray rubber band. She was able to unloose herself from the rubber bands, and even unhitched the spacecrafts from similar stuff.The terrible: tons of old-time looking cockpit equipment. The dregs. Yard sale rejects. Nothing high tech here. Was this the 1970s, or current times? (I missed the first few minutes). She even read printed manuals. That is so old-school. Nobody does that anymore. She should have had way more knowledge about spacecraft operation in general. Maybe she could have gone online to get instructions, but perhaps the stuff was so old that there were no online manuals. Wait a minute. Are there internet connections on space stations? Of course, they could have burned up in all of the fires and explosions.I predicted, and it came true: she was going to land in the ocean, ala John Glenn and Friendship 7 -- a small capsule. Here, she dumps the spacesuit in the water, and takes forever to reach the surface. No oxygen there, down in the deep. Ryan, stick your arms and hands straight up. She hits the top and all of a sudden floats on her back, or does some kind of backstroke. Were those Blue Angels overhead, or more wasted space debris?I predicted Clooney would rescue her for real, or at least on the ground or near the ocean, but this did not happen. Where were the international TV news staffs, rescue vehicles, space employees -- nobody was around to help her. Where were Houston and Cape Canaveral falling all over themselves to rescue her? I know, they were still in the Town of Bedrock, shooting slingshots of large boulders into outer space.Do you think that she even had a welcome-home ticker tape parade?7/10",7,1,3,6 April 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Singing great.
","Depp and Bonham Carter very good singers. I enjoyed them. The kid Toby great too, although I felt his upper range soprano was just a little too high-pitched. Fun comedy. I had already seen this show live on stage, and the movie was not disappointing. Enjoyed seeing Timothy Spall and Alan Rickman. I remember seeing Bonham Carter in 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', where she played Charlie's mother, and of course Johnny Depp in that same movie. Both excellent in that, too. I keep saying (read my other reviews) that long live movie musicals, and 'Sweeney Todd' I hope will help in the revival of this totally enjoyable entertainment medium. I even enjoyed seeing Johnny and Helena doing their dancing (waltzes?) around the room (in 'Todd'), and you know I like dancing movies, too. Finally, kiddos, do not be discouraged by all the blood in this movie. Remember that it is all fake, that you would well know if you had had acting classes and stage makeup coursework like I have had. I am sure Johnny Depp must have a hard time keeping a straight face as he carved up the dastardly judge as played by Alan Rickman. I'm sure it must have been really tempting to just burst out laughing. I have seen Rickman play some sinister parts, like Rasputin, so I am glad the judge character got what was coming to him.",Null,1,1,30 April 2008
The Aviator," Beautiful. Brilliant. Riveting. 12/10.
","Awesome in spirit, of snapshots of the lives of Howard Hughes, Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Jean Harlow. Beautiful. Brilliant. Riveting. 12/10. Hughes' personality tics were addressed, down to the long fingernails and germ fears. Yuck. Beautifully essayed by Mr. Di Caprio. Apparently the mental illness began quite early in Mr. Hughes' life, but I noticed that when Hughes was flying his planes he was totally professional and on top of things. I actually liked the 3 hour length of this movie, and feel that it took that long to tell the story of a very complicated and caring man. I loved the part where Howard annihilates the senator in the courtroom. I was rooting for Howard to beat him at the hearings, and I was not disappointed. 'Ol' sick Howard' really gave him what-for. Howard invented the word 'guts', and I feel that Leonardo Di Caprio did an excellent job. Kudos to the actor. Hughes was a great aviation pioneer. Again, 12/10.",10,3,9,28 December 2004
Hugo," Good, interesting movie
","Atmosphere in trailer reminded me of Harry Potter-Hogwarts movies because of the train. That's one reason I wanted to see this movie. Johnny Depp's company making this movie made sense when I consider all the fantasy roles played by Depp. Scorsese excellent, teaching us more about the early silent movies. I thought the era was 1920s, judging by some of the clothes in this movie, but later I read that it was 1931. World War One also apparently killed Broadway, not just movies. After that period - WWI, IMO, lots of stage actors went Hollywood, including the Barrymores - John, Ethel and Lionel. There was more money to be made in Hollywood than on the NY boards.This movie supposed to be in Paris I thought, but lots of actors had British accents. This is not good, but as the movie wore on I forgot all about that.Loved all the dogs in this movie. Were the small brown dogs supposed to be male and female? If so, I expected them to start co-mingling and making a litter of little brown puppies any second now.Reading about Melies' life, Jeanne was his second wife and not in his early movies as depicted in this movie. Still, the actress here did a splendid job.I feel that Tabard was really Scorsese, being a movie historian and doing everything he could to preserve early cinema.10/10",10,3,6,25 March 2012
The Patriot," Don't Call Me A Buff
","I am a history major at a university. I watch these movies for the entertainment and the costumes. I watch them even more to see people like Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger, and others including the daughter of Vanessa Redgrave. We know that historical accuracy may not be what sells tickets to movies. It is comforting to know, however, that at the end of the credits all due respect is given to The Smithsonian Institution for their excellent guidance. For total accuracy, check out the History Channel, though sometimes I feel that their presentations are none too intelligent.That said, I am also an actor. I try to watch 'most' of the gory scenes, knowing full well about the special effects, miniatures and fake blood and gore. I also know that no animals were hurt in this film, so when we see a horse stabbed we know that it is just an illusion for movie making. We must suspend our sense of reality.I hate the phrase 'history buff'. That is for all of those armchair critics of the American Civil War (yes, there were/are plenty of civil wars in other countries). Getting a college degree in history is much more important than being on either the side of the Union or the Confederacy in the 1861-1865 conflict.This movie shows the British war strategists to be brilliant. They obviously have access to an English treasury that will finance all of their trappings, ships, weapons, etc. They fight in formal rows, as do the Continentals. The Continentals get slaughtered big-time, until ol' Mel Gibson, in his anger, fires up his band of ragtag homeboys to eventually turn the war around around to the good-new U.S. of A., LOL. Mel (Martin) obviously learned this from being that great hero of the French and Indian Wars, being a British soldier but somehow noticing that the Indians/Native Americans never fought in neat rows like they were going out for a Sunday outing. Martin found out that to hide behind trees and dress in blah colors was a sure way to beat the Redcoats (the new enemy, circa-1776) who were his former compatriots. Besides, if animals could disappear from the environment and not be seen by predators, maybe Mel and his buddies could, too. Mel and his drunkards (pow-sock-bam-biff-bop) had several instances of line-fighting, even alongside the Continental uniformed regulars.I figured early on that Mel would face Tavington and kill that redcoated scoundrel at the end (the big finale), but I didn't figure on Gabriel (Ledger) getting killed much less the younger boy getting killed also. That was heartbreaking, but remember folks, it's fake blood and bottled ooze. Tavington (Jason Isaacs, later of Captain Hook snarling infamy) finally got HIS, but kept refusing to die, first at the hands of Gabriel then at the fatal unmercy of ol' Braveheart himself. But of course, Mel outfoxed him, and lived to see his sons' lives avenged. Even Peter Pan (2003) finished off Isaacs by feeding Hook to the bloodthirsty crocodile. If you saw 'Peter Pan', you know that Hook/Isaacs went down 'old, alone, and unloved'). As far as Tavington and his annihilation, go figure. Cornwallis didn't like his sadistic tactics, and Tavington's officers figured him for a insane madman to boot. Maybe they were glad that Mel finished him off.To see even humongously more fake blood and gore, visit Mel's 'Passion of the Christ'.13/10.",Null,1,2,5 July 2007
Gone with the Wind," Great
","Great. Stunning. Excellent. Beautiful costuming. Red slinky dress on Scarlett is totally smashing. Green drape dress quite ingenious. White gown on her stunning. Mammy and Prissy clothes drab and wish they could have had dressy clothes also. Belle Watling clothing bright and beautifully garish. Bonnie Blue always looks cute and lovely. Rhett and Ashley dashing and gentlemanly looks.Music pleasant and a nice background. Miz Scarlett was a whiz at attracting all those men. She had to keep fighting them off. I noticed a future Superman early in the film on the front steps. Later she marries a boy then an old man, says Rhett later, but he is no spring chicken himself.",10,3,4,24 November 2017
Lawrence of Arabia," Fighting and killing.
","Fighting and killing. Ugh.Lose a point for no women in main cast or supporting cast. No women with major or minor speaking parts. Nurses near the end don't count. They were being shepherded out of a truck, and had no dialogue.Lose a point for violence. No song and dance movie here, which as you know is my favorite film genre.I was just watching this movie because people talk about it, specifically men - never have I heard a woman ever mention this film.O'Toole wasn't hard to look at, nor was Sharif - both in their younger primes. Sharif would go on to star in Dr. Zhivago.Guinness was excellent. Quinn was comical. The teenage boys were adorable, although having bad outcomes.You knew that O'Toole's character wasn't going to meet his end on the desert battlefield, because the story was told in flashback from the time that Lawrence crashed the motorcycle in 1935, which really happened. Such a pretty face wasn't going to be done in by the bandits or other bad guys.No women. No romances or love triangles.Camels beautiful and wonderful. Some of their accoutrements were excellently designed. Camels were being deprived of enough water, I thought. This was terrible.Costuming beautiful and wonderful. Desert clothing flowing and excellent, especially on O'Toole. Guiness' princely/kingly clothing design I thought was very regal and handsome.Musical themes were excellent. Main melody was very nice and not obnoxiously repetitive.Supposed to be a pretty much historically accurate film.Wogs was a put-down epithet, which is a racist term that might not be used today. O'Toole's disguise was so good at one point that he was called a wog himself.Get that boy a bath and clean clothes (O'Toole). Oh, how filthy.8 / 10",8,0,2,23 December 2019
The Lives of Others," Creepy. Suspenseful.
","Creepy. Suspenseful.Spoilers. Opinions. Observations.Pre-end of Berlin Wall coming tumbling down (in East Germany) a few years into the future. Creepy officers voice-manhandling hard-working artistes such as a playwright and an actress. They are not allowed to delve into western ideals nor any whiff of outside influences. If you as their compatriots know about any of that shameful subversive stuff, it's off to the Teutonic salt mines for you (or the equivalent).This reminds one of more recent times when writers and journalists in other countries are criminalized for their modern ideas, spending lives in prison or jails of the mind - not to mention self-demise as happened to a movie director in this film.This film: Rated 'R'. Sex-sex-sex. The actress with the playwright. The actress with a jowly, ugly old man, forcibly, in the back of a limousine. Another man with a pay-by-the-half-hour 'professional' hookup.A red typewriter ribbon tells a lot. The portable typewriter itself is a significant character in this drama, and becomes an important piece of evidence.This story is told in hindsight, perhaps in flashbacking. The main characters are, early on, tortured in many ways, but some actually live through the wall coming down and the nation of that time ceasing to exist into the future. Even some of the bad guys manage to make it to the new life. The playwright, earlier blackballed against writing because of his 'crimes', has now written a book on display in the Karl Marx bookstore. Scratching my head about old Karl. I thought that he was passé after the wall came down.If you thought that Hogan's Heroes was funny, about an earlier Germanic time period, this film ain't hilarious, folks. There are no dumbkopf Colonel Klink or slow-on-the-uptake Sergeant Schultz, but there are high-ranking officers here wearing close-to-Nazi uniforms that remind one of World War Two.Spoiler: Seeing the actress all bloody in the street, near the end, I remembered that I have studied acting many times and that this is all fake and that she is just playing a part. An actress was portraying an actress who was harassed by insane goons whose days were numbered. Earlier in this film, she was an actress in a play on stage while the goons scrutinized her with binoculars. I thought, 'This is a play within a play.'I have critiqued films for IMDb since 2002. I take ongoing film studies coursework at university, and have a BA in History from there. I have also acted on stage and studied theatre, theatrical critiquing and censorship, stage makeup, dance, voice and fine arts at that university. The arts are my life.",8,0,2,15 July 2019
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Nice movie.
","I first heard about Walter Mitty during English class in high school. The teacher just raved about this character. I remembered Mitty as a bumbling, ignorant fool who spent his life lost in thought about being involved in make-believe situations. Mitty the super-hero, as it were -- in the parlance of today's talk.I knew about the Danny Kaye movie. I saw it, and I thought that it was good. Since then, I have noticed some actual people who act like Walter and are always lost in their very inventive fantasies.I liked the Ben Stiller movie. I immediately recognized Sean Penn, right when he was first seen in this movie. I marveled at his sage sayings near the end when Mitty finally found him. This was a famous photographer, and Mitty and Mitty's mother (the wonderful Shirley MacLaine) actually knew him, FOR REAL. I did not know Stiller was a movie producer. I feel that he did a good job both as producer and lead actor. I remember his parents from when they were on TV a long time ago. They were a very talented pair.Stiller was very sweet as Walter Mitty. Mitty was a very dedicated magazine employee. He had a very loyal assistant, who was very helpful in trying to find the missing photograph. The actress, who became Mitty's love interest, was very kind. Mitty made a nice gesture in giving her son the skateboard.Walter was relentless in looking for the photographer. He traveled internationally, at a great distance. He met nice people. The scenery was lovely and breathtaking. A great scene was when Mitty skateboarded a long distance. The helicopter scenes were quite good.10/10",10,0,2,11 February 2014
Lincoln," No Jefferson Davis
","No song and dance in this movie. What am I doing, reviewing a drama? Sounds boring as heck. Anyhoo, I shall proceed. Yes, there is singing in this movie, but not my favorite Broadway kind.Jefferson Davis is missing. In his place is dorky Jackie Earle Haley, whom I remember as having played a goof-ball would-be-rapist in the movie Little Children, where a major scene is of Patrick Wilson and Kate Winslet 'visiting' each other, in the altogether, over-top equipment in a laundry room. That said, upon Wiki research I find Jackie did an excellent job in portraying the physical looks of the real Confederate vice president. Who would have played old Jeff Davis? Hmmmm, let me see, maybe -- oh yes, a good one, in the craggy anorexic male department -- might be Harry Dean Stanton -- he of Big Love fame as the scary, creepy faux-LDS patriarch.Going to the end, Tommy Lee Jones, bald, in bed, with his housekeeper/lady friend, was quite interesting. This was quite an interesting denouement to the movie.I DID think of Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher, during the Lincoln movie, Bill of Gangs of New York. In GONY, Day-Lewis went mano-a-mano into his own fighting and even butcherings and torturings. In the end, Leonardo DiCaprio made mincemeat out of Day-Lewis (spoiler). You can see Bill when you look at Daniel as Lincoln. Ironically, GONY takes place during the Civil War Draft Riots, where tons of men did not want to go fight Lincoln's war, and they were all YANKEES.Mary Todd Lincoln was not crazy. Her detractors, jealous as they were, spread these nasty rumors. Even her oldest son bought into the mayhem, locking her up in an institution. That he had Mary's maiden name as his middle name, later showed his unappreciation for Mama's loving upbringing.No John Wilkes Booth, Mrs. Surratt, Dr. Mudd, Laura Keene, Julia Dent Grant and others remotely or directly associated with the assassination? Of course, that was a totally different story. All of a sudden, in this movie, President is shot, with no back-story of that particular incident. I realize that, yes, days earlier the Civil War had actually been drawn to a peace. Laura Keene ran the theatrical company playing at Ford's Theatre during the fateful evening. General and Mrs. Grant had also been invited to the show at Ford's, but did not attend. Many of the cabinet members shown in the Lincoln movie had ALSO been assassination targets, but due to multiple ineptitudes of Booth's motley crew of assassination doofuses, our dear Mr. Lincoln was the only one who lost his life.The kid who played Robert Lincoln looked like Heath Ledger, although I knew that would not be possible. The boy who played Tad Lincoln was very good, and the character appeared to be very intelligent and caring.Sally Field did a great job as Mary. Remember, Mary predicted Lincoln would be president. This may have been from a premonitional dream, and I think also that another premonitional dream predicted his assassination. Like other women of the day, Mary became involved in séance activity, especially after the death of her dear son Willie. Death was a way of life in those days, not just on the battlefield but during women's childbirth, children's pre-adolescent diseases, etc. Surgical washing of hands was not even practiced until after the Civil War. A woman could have 12 children, and have 5-6 live to adulthood.Lots of African Americans making their entrance into the congressional chamber was very heartening. Seeing African American soldiers in the Civil War was very good.I will research other Lincoln movies, including the one with Henry Fonda.",7,0,3,20 March 2013
Annie Hall," Murky
","Alvy hasn't much confidence. He must be some kind of loser in the bedroom. He's no big muscular bruiser. He is browbeaten by Mother, and is such a dweeb elsewhere. He's a know it all who doesn't know much. It's called 'Annie', but it's about Alvy's glaring insecurities. It's a personality study about his life, notwithstanding his several sexual partners who as a group find him sort of an underwhelming nobody. Annie, on the other hand, seems to be his major failure. In real life, these two actors had a relationship a few years before this film was made. Question: Do all/most of these women have to jump into bed with Alvy the minute they've laid eyes on him? What's his secret? Millions of men want to know.",8,0,0,8 February 2020
Singin' in the Rain," Awesome musical.
","15/10.My observations about this movie: Great dancing!!! My favorite the triple tap dance with Donald, Debbie and Gene: 'Good Morning, Good Morning!', all dressed up in grays and light blues. I loved Debbie's blue high heeled tap shoes. They were just divine. This show-stopper was very powerful, lightning-fast-paced and highly energetic, and even done in the wee hours of that morning. When the three danced down the steps, and over the sofa, was totally awesome. The characters were deciding to turn 'The Dueling Cavalier' into a musical.I love musicals, and I always stand up for them. This was one of the greatest. Singing and dancing are my favorites, as you know.I liked seeing Kathleen Freeman as the voice coach. The coach didn't quite succeed with the stubborn and air-headed Lina Lamont, however. We believe that Lina is really dumb, too, and Lina convinces us that education was never her cup of tea.Gene was great acting the cad movie heartthrob, even though a negative character. I don't like it when he played this side of the character, being all selfish, boastful and thinking he was God's gift to women. Even in 'The Pirate', he plays a smarmy so-and-so who is too fresh for Judy Garland's sensibilities, and such a jerk there again.I better like Gene playing the wonderful human being, of course with a great set of tap dancing feet. Gene's 'Singin' In the Rain' number in this movie is highly lauded, dancing around the lamppost and getting pneumonia during the filming, but it is my second favorite dance in the film after 'Good Morning!' Other movies where I like Gene's characters are 'On the Town' and 'Take Me Out to the Ball Game'.My third favorite 'dance' is with Donald and the cloth dummy. Too bad Donald didn't get a romantic part in this movie, like he did in 'Call Me Madam', when he is interested in the Princess Royal and dances with her (Vera-Ellen / I thought, 'Miss Turnstiles'!!, from 'On the Town'!!). In 'Singin' In the Rain', in the scene where Donald dodges all the two-by-fours and workmen traveling, I feel that this is a marvel in choreography and adaptation to props in the way. The fake hallway on the wall is excellent, as is the wall where Donald jumps through.Debbie Reynolds was excellent. She was quite an energetic tap dancer, and a good singer.Finally, retrogressing to the beginning, I like the early part where Donald and Gene are children and then dance partners, musicians and singers in Vaudeville.15/10, actually, I repeat.",10,0,1,11 February 2010
Puss in Boots," Awesome swashbuckler.
","So Antonio Banderas is the Errol Flynn of modern animation. It was a great movie, and not just for children. I liked Kitty Softpaws. She was great, constantly smarter and outwitting Senor Banderas in his gato persona. Kitty could have been portrayed by Catherine Zeta-Jones, easily, because I liked her with Banderas and their swordplay in the Zorro movie. Salma Hayek did a wonderful job, however.It was a very physical movie, with the main characters leaping up and down several stories and doing acrobatic flips and turns a lot of the time.Jack and Jill were hilarious, what with their family of wild boars and their darling infant. A lot of their jokes may not have been 'gotten' by child audiences, but to older people the situation was really funny. You can forget all your cares and woes when you watch this couple.10/10",Null,2,5,6 February 2012
Alice in Wonderland," Awesome Movie
","Depp excellent, as always. Mia sweet, demure and later strong minded and self confident. Helena quite regal and a little bit mad, but, hey, that's what this movie is all about. Alice's father, well, I had hoped he would actually show up somehow in the end of the movie, maybe even having been the hatter, but it didn't happen. Maybe in a sequel . . .Hamish an idiotic, stupid bore. His father great person. His mother also stupid. Alice's aunt: too bad Prince Charming didn't ride up and rescue her.Jabberwocky breathtaking and powerful, but I guess Alice's not being afraid of him finally did him in. Doesn't that happen to all of our abusers?Loved all the rabbits and the hare, also the dormouse, dog and Cheshire cat, plus the big thing or animal who carries Alice alongside the dog later.Anne Hathaway excellent. Those lips and nails a perfect combination of cold edge to the white overlay. The white surroundings a refreshing opposition to all the red and black of the red queen.The white courtiers and soldiers heavenly; the red soldiers a wonder in costume design and originality.10/10",10,0,1,26 May 2010
Titanic," Really an accident?
","I write in bytes. Saves time. This movie a gem. A rather fictional love story of poor boy comes on to rich girl from social climbing family who are down on their luck. Evil villain of a fiancé for the girl. The poor boy is a talented artist who has spent time sketching naked harlots in Gay Paree, lol. Rich girl strips her clothes off and poses for boy artist. Nasty fiancé goes gunning for poor boy. Puppy dog valet/hit-man for fiancé does some really goofy chasing down the ship for poor artist boy.As an OSU history major, I feel, in all seriousness:I know this story was fictional, and that the real story was tragic and ugly. Sometimes I think the supposed disaster was a real set-up and early harbinger of World War I. Perhaps the ship designers and certain cruise line executives were in cahoots with the evil perpetrators of the war. The war started in Europe in 1914, two years after the Titanic disaster. Not just a coincidence. German leaders had been arguing among themselves for decades leading up to the war, and perhaps they figured that a disaster really embarrassing the British and Americans would be a real coup in their attempt to conquer the world.Maybe the Germans were investors in White Star, and wanted the insurance money to fund their growing war. Wars do cost lots of money, and Germany as a united nation began in 1871, only about 40 years earlier. Young nations don't have a lot of money to fund such endeavors.There are no accidents, according to philosophical theory. Germany had been in unrest all during the early part of the 20th Century -- events leading up to World War I. Another close-in-time famous ship disaster was 1915: the Lusitania, hit-destroyed-sunk by German U-boats (armed with torpedoes) who had warned that ship not to be caught in its shipping lanes. Lots of famous and important people were aboard the Lusitania, and also lots of rich-and-famous were aboard the Titanic. Even the ships' names are rather alike.The chilling part is that it is now almost 2012 -- 100 years after the fatal Titanic disaster. Now, in 2007, 2012 is five years away. All things come back around, and I imagine there will be some sort of commemorative remembrances regarding the Titanic in 2012. Why has this 'accident' been called the most famous ship disaster in history? Why are all those movies (and even a Broadway musical) made of this unfortunate loss of life and wealthy property?Titanic: How could such a magnificent ship suddenly crack up like so much balsa wood? I feel there was lots of sabotage and manipulation. I hope that there were real first-love stories aboard this ship, as suggested in this movie.The Queen of the Sea was supposed to be bigger, stronger, better, and much more well-built than all other ships of its day, not to mention ultra-luxurious and mega-speedy. Its riveting was world-class, and its workmanship unparalleled. Nay, not an accident, but perhaps, and only perhaps, a 'red herring' to take the world's attention away from the growing Teutonic holocaust in Europe.",10,1,2,3 October 2007
Dark Shadows," I always like Johnny Depp.
","I always like Johnny Depp. He can really play the quirky characters, like Edward Scissorhands or Willy Wonka. He was great here as Barnabas Collins. He looked like Michael Jackson when he donned the dark fedora and sunglasses.Johnny's delivery of Barnabas was hilarious. He carried the jokes well. He looked really gory with blood on his face. He just had to have those meals, though.Angelique would never take no for an answer. She dogged Barnabas mercilessly, and I am glad he got in the final blows for her demise. She was a real tormentor.I saw the original Dark Shadows TV series, way back in the day. I liked it. I also liked Jonathan Frid as Barnabas. Johnny's lines are funnier, but I think that Frid's lines were of a drier type of humor.I liked Jackie Earle Haley's quiet performance. It was low-keyed and humorous. He must have been the handyman or caretaker of the mansion. He drove the car great. This is a marked difference of character compared to his disturbed rapist in 'Little Children'. Of course, he is known from his youth in 'Bad News Bears' and 'Breaking Away'. He is very versatile.The special effects were fabulous. They could be funny, and also scary.Johnny's Barnabas has a way of surprising people. In addition, he is also very thoughtful. He is astute to old times and new times. He even provided the real Alice Cooper for his descendant's party. That was very kind and caring. Barnabas at first thought Alice was female.It was nice that Barnabas wanted to bring back his family's fortunes from their near demise. He had a positive and determined effort to revive the family treasury and community leadership.Did he get to spend eternity with Josette? Would they live forever? This was at the end.Tim Burton, you are always great.10/10",10,3,6,15 April 2014
Music and Lyrics," Cute and sweet; some clothes a little too vulgar for children to see
","I liked the Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore pairing in this movie. I saw four Drew movies this week: Music and Lyrics in the theater, and the rest on TV: Ever After, Riding in Cars with Boys, Never Been Kissed, and number 5 (a little of) Boys on the Side. I notice in this movie Drew is getting older, and so is Hugh Grant. So are the rest of us. But I digress . . .Drew has twice played a writer in these movies: in Music and Lyrics, and in Riding in Cars with Boys. I think she pulls it off well.Hugh's bumping and grinding reminds me of Mick Jagger, and may in fact be a parody.I pretty much liked the whole movie, except where the young kids saw Cora in very abbreviated clothing. That was a little embarrassing.The story of the weight loss business of Drew's sister seemed to be a sub-story not fully developed, yet it had to stay in the background due to the main story being how Drew and Hugh collaborated on the music and lyrics they wrote == hence the name of this movie, obviously.I think Drew looks like her great uncle and great aunt, Lionel Barrymore and Ethel Barrymore, who in their youth looked a lot like the Drew of today. I have seen some very young Ethel Barrymore photos, and the resemblance is sometimes uncanny.Well, enough said. I always like Drew movies and Hugh movies. Where do these two go from here? They seem to respect each other a lot in the interviews I have read about this movie, and I hope they team up again.9/10",9,0,0,16 June 2007
The Greatest Showman," PTB the Greatest
","Phineas Taylor Barnum is one of my biggest heroes in life. You all know that I just love musicals. PT inspires me all the time. He in real life was a marketing genius. If he were still alive, the Ringling Bros Barnum and Bailey Combined Circus would not have gone out of business in May, 2017. That was a total tragedy.I have studied this man's life, for many decades. Here was a man who came from a poor New England time period - specifically born before the War of 1812 and growing up in the midst of a financial depression - one of many U.S. depressions. He could make money from absolutely nothing. He found that people, a lot of them, would fork over their small amounts of hard-earned cash in order to participate in one of his hocus-pocusy outrageous ideas. He built upon these small successes. He was no dummy. He was very smart and shrewd. Eventually he brought the lovely famous Scandinavian singer to these shores, as depicted in this film. Jenny Lind Crib, anyone? Yes, her name is still famous here. More of his famous talent are depicted in this film, ala Tom Thumb. What about Jumbo, Barnum's famous elephant? I don't remember Jumbo from the reviews. Late in life, after several entertainment careers, he began his famous circus, with an accountant names James A. Bailey. After Barnum passed away in 1891, the circus kept going and during the decade of the First World War (100 years ago) merged with that of the Ringling Brothers. I have been out ill this year, having heart surgery, but I still have made a few movie reviews. This is one of them. Please post this review. I hope to see this new film today or tomorrow, Wednesday or Thursday. This Friday is my birthday. Again, I am an historian, with a university degree in American History. I am also an actress, singer, dancer, film critic and movie reviewer. I feel that some of P.T. Barnum's greatest successes occurred after the time period of America's Civil War. Certainly, his famous circus came from that historic era. I will give this film a ten out of ten, sight unseen. I just love musicals, so add more points. Everyone, go see this film. Have some fun in your lives. Phineas Taylor Barnum still inspires. Note 1: PT was the mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut. I visited there, looking for memorials to his life. I saw some, like a plaque in front of one of the buildings or perhaps the old city hall, in 2006. Note 2: I saw a PT Barnum televised film starring Beau Bridges as Barnum, some decades ago, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a drama. I don't remember it being as colorful, however, as this new 2017 Barnum is said to be.",10,8,22,20 December 2017
Saving Mr. Banks," I DO love the singing and dancing!
","Opposite of Ms. Travers Goff, I DO like the singing and dancing in Mary Poppins. I always have. In fact, if you read my other almost 200 IMDb reviews, you will see that those are my main criteria for judging a movie.What a dull Poppins movie we would have had without the song and dance. I also truly LOVED Dick Van Dyke in Poppins movie. I do not recall Saving Mr. Banks explaining why Travers Goff did not want Dick Van Dyke.Then there are the PENGUINS. They are so sweet, and such smart waiters. I liked seeing the tall human-acted penguins at the premiere of Poppins. You can tell that Ms. Travers Goff (I can only think to call her that) must have needed money pretty badly to put up with all the merrymaking changes to her droll movie she thought she'd end up with.So, was Colin Farrell really Mr. Banks? I don't remember Farrell with a kite or putting up with that silly (not my opinion) suffragist (suffragette is the wrong historical term) 'nonsense' (also not my opinion). Farrell played a handsome dude not looking like his rather plain, bookish poetry-writing oldest daughter. Somehow the mother was very unhappy, since 'Ginty' seemed to dote on dear old dad and not on the hard-working slave-driven mama.Ginty as a child looked way too tall to ride on her father's back. I think that looked pretty unrealistic, if not rather bizarre and smacking of some sort of a little too smarmy relationship with the child IMO.So the daughter grew up with major thoughts of dear old dad, yet not much was opined about how she tried to save her adult mother from suicidal drowning. Maybe mama was jealous of Ginty and dad being a little-or-a-lot too close, if you get my drift. The young Ginty actress looked tall enough to be on the verge of puberty, etc., etc.What a mean-spirited P.L. toward Disney himself! Walt had paid for her hotel and air transportation, meals, chauffeur service, etc., etc., yet the English brat was extremely rude. If she hated America so much, she should not have even crossed the pond. Of course, you did not see any such British tycoon offering her a fortune to convert her stories into a film.I liked Tom Hanks' performance. He seemed to portray the stereotyped Disney with manners, dignity and aplomb. I feel that the character had a very difficult time not wanting to out and out slug the ungrateful Britisher.Milk first, and then tea. Don't get me wrong. I really liked this movie, because it gave a lot of warm feelings and remembrances. I also liked the Poppins movie clips, although I feel they were too short. I liked the portrayals of the Sherman brothers when they sang, danced and played the movie characters.10/10",10,0,2,25 February 2014

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Excellent
","I saw some of the first movies, then nothing until now. I thought the genre wasn't my cup of tea. I took my husband, b/c he loves Harry et al. Little did I know that I would be caught up in this adventure, even if it didn't have song or dance. With all the hoopla about the Harry series, I have learned more from news items and promos than from these movies, since as I said I have seen few.I love the magical train. It is so cute. The Hogwarts Express is ingenious. Skipping to the end (spoiler), the train was as beautiful as originally, and somehow reminded me of Thomas the Tank Engine, although there was a different color scheme, of course. That the main stars' future children had boarded this train on the way to Hogwarts was, I felt, a fitting connection to things to come. There won't be any more of these movies, and more's the pity. I would liked to have seen the children going to Hogwarts, getting into all sorts of adventures, like their parents had done, and playing Quidditch (sp?). I did enjoy seeing the grown-up characters, e.g. Harry and the others with older-adult type hairstyles and clothing.Also getting to the end (another spoiler), I was thrilled to see that Hogwarts had been rebuilt to its majestic self during those 19 years into the future. During this movie, Hogwarts had been blown to smithereens, over and over again, by 'the bad guys' -- Lord Voldemort (?) and his band of dopey so-called killahs (my description, lol). As few times as I have seen the Harry movies, I always thought that Hogwarts was huge, stately and beautiful before its attempted Armageddon.Baby Harry was cute. When he had tears in his eyes, it was so sad. Hagrid was excellent, as usual.I have seen Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook in 'Peter Pan 2003', and Kelly MacDonald played Peter Pan in 'Return to Neverland'. In this movie, Kelly as the feminine ghost looked so familiar, and so I did some research.Well, that's about it, kiddoes. See my other reviews.I predict a great future for Daniel, Emma and Rupert.",Null,0,1,21 July 2011
Shall We Dance," Good dancing, from a dancing fan.
","I like all song and dance movies, dance movies, song movies. Makes no difference. IMO we need more of them. As a tap dancer, I enjoyed Gere's footwork in 'Chicago', and wished there had been more of it. In 'Shall We Dance', early on I thought John was trying to surprise his wife with learning how to dance since so many men have clumsy left feet while their wives are usually much better dancers. I liked all the actors in their parts. Tucci was hilarious. Sarandon was veteran, capable and qualified. John's daughter finally came around and admitted Dad was okay, when she saw him in that tux dancing in the competition near the end. Wow, Dad has grace now. Even in this day of hip-hop, Dad isn't so bad after all. John's fellow male dance students were very sweet, and I liked the part at the end where Vern finally has his wedding and dances with his bride, and the 3rd guy is even able to dance at a gay bar -- to boogie down with the best of them. Perhaps he will win a dance contest there, too. A very sweet movie. Very happy to see Anita Gillette (great first name). 10/10.",10,0,1,29 December 2004
Gangs of New York," Visually Stunning
","These are my impressions of this movie: It was very powerful. I missed the beginning; saw most of the rest on TV today. Hope to see the whole thing sometime.I was not able to see this movie when it was new. I can remember wanting to see it for the nerdy, goofy plaid pants and giant top hats of the main male characters. I am interested in historic fashion design.Bill the Butcher almost comical. Daniel Day-Lewis was very striking with his accent, since this character was nowhere near Day-Lewis' elegant gentleman of 'The Age of Innocence' or his rustic Hawkeye in 'Last of the Mohicans'.DiCaprio: Like Day-Lewis, good in historical dramas. For DiCaprio, this movie was made in between 'Titanic' and 'The Aviator'. I saw them both, and also first saw DiCaprio in 'Romeo and Juliet'. I was thinking how I had seen 'Titanic' many times, remembering Jack's ending scene where he was being frozen and then slipped beneath the waves soon before Rose was rescued. I feel that DiCaprio really inhabits his characters. I was so amazed that he became Howard Hughes in 'The Aviator', and in 'Gangs' he does not disappoint. The cool thing is that Amsterdam is a quick learner, and learns to use Bill the Butcher's instructions to do-in the old buzzard himself, LOL.I am a History Major at The Ohio State University. I know that the draft riots happened, but did not know that they occurred during the background of this story. I will do research on the draft riots.Since I didn't see the early part of 'Gangs', I must have missed where Day-Lewis' and DiCaprio's goofy clothes were untouched by all the blood, gore and destruction of their final battle. The duel was very scary, but looks like Superman beat Lex Luthor again.Kudos to Director Scorsese!12/10",Null,0,2,25 June 2007
The Great Gatsby," Awesome film.
","Upon second and third viewing, DVR I saw on November 16, 2016, I call this film surreal art deco. It was an artistic way of showing empty, immoral decadence of a young populace demoralized by the horrors, tragedies and losses of the recent World War One.Yes, on my second tour I saw this film twice, seeing more than I did the first time. I think that Maguire is not as wooden as reviewers here make him out to be. Is Nick the author Fitzgerald, or is Gatsby? Did Nick ever have any romantic involvements, not mentioning the wild drunkenness of the earlier part of this film?I also kept seeing the films The Aviator and again Citizen Kane upon seeing this film in November 2016. DiCaprio's eyebrow looks reminded me of his Howard Hughes in The Aviator, and the trashy and garish opulence of too many material goods reminded me of Citizen Kane.Upon first viewing some years ago: Awesome film. Beautiful costuming. I never saw the 1974 film version of this F. Scott Fitzgerald story, but perhaps some other time. Di Caprio dies in this movie, just like he did in 'Titanic'. The early 1920s were shown as a period of extreme wealth and crime, post-World War One, which was the War to End All Wars. Nick worked on Wall Street, later to come crashing down on everyone including the wrongdoers.Movie reminds me of 'Citizen Kane'. A man rich in material wealth, but a sad, lonely little boy in spirit. All Gatsby wanted was Daisy. All Kane wanted was Rosebud. Both men lost their material riches. There is snow or something fluttering in Citizen Kane, as well in this Gatsby film.The exteriors of the homes of Gatsby and Daisy were superb and exquisite. The interiors were, of course, plush and elegant.I enjoyed seeing the dancers. One reminded me of Josephine Baker. Spot-on image. The party-goers were both elegant as well as decadent. Poor Nick was just determined to get drunk. It was all very realistic.The cars were just beautiful. The acting was excellent. All were believable, in my opinion. The actors did a great job. I hope to even read this novel sometime.The bloodiness of the woman killed by the car was an excellent fake bloody makeup job. The cut on her breast was very realistic.The extreme anger of her husband was justified. His wife had been playing around with Daisy's husband, who sneakily inferred that Gatsby had killed the wife. The twist was that the husband went after Gatsby; earlier, I had thought that Daisy's husband (I forget his name) was going to do the deed, but the garage owner beat him to it. :( 10/10",10,0,3,6 April 2014
