The Ring," Crappy re-make
","Wow, why do these Americans have to make crappy re-makes of all the good films in the world. Doesn't they understand how to read the subtitles?The original Japanese trilogy from 1998 is far better than this crap. That kept me awake and i have not wanted to see it again, alone at least. See it, alone and in complete darkness, and you will know what i talk about. That's real scary and not this crap of 'Scream if you know what i did last Halloween' - thing.",3,1,2,25 November 2002
