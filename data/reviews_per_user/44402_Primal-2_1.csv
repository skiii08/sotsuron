The Blair Witch Project," The Scariest Film Ever... I DON'T THINK SO!
","'The Scariest Film Ever'...I don't think so!I walked into the movie theater feeling that I had actually spent my money well for once, but I left feeling more ripped off than I had in my entire life!WARNING:  This film is not the slightest bit scary!The only thing I actually liked about the movie, and the only thing that will save it was the acting!  The three actors in the film give one of the most realistic performances I've ever seen in a movie.  Yes, some of the things they do are just flat out stupid, but the dialogue between the three of them is excellent.  If it wasn't for the chemistry, or lack there of, between these characters this film wouldn't be worth putting in theaters at all.  As I said before, the acting was the only thing I enjoyed about this film. Simply put, the rest of the movie was terrible. There was nothing in the movie that was really scary.  As a matter of fact, I wasn't frightened for a second.  Don't get me wrong.  I went to this movie wanting to see a really scary movie, but the film just didn't deliver!  That's really my main problem with this movie, it just isn't scary, and that's what it was pawned off on everyone to be.  Another problem with the movie was the camera work.  Yes, it was cool to present the film as clips from the cameras they we're using, but the camera work was enough to make you sick.  BOUNCE, BOUNCE, BOUNCE.  It was almost more annoying than it was effective.  Along with the picture bouncing all over creation, I thought the lack of music throughout the movie was a bad idea.  Music adds a great deal to any movie, especially horror movie.
My final problem with the movie is the lack of common sense. I know there isn't very much common sense to any horror movie, but let's think about a few thing here.  One, how long can a battery in a video camera last? Honestly I don't know, but three or four days plus seems to be pushing it without a good re-charging.  Two,  why would you continue to stop and sleep if you know something is after you?  You might as well just walk away from your friends and say, 'I'll be right back.'  I thought most college students were suppose to be smart.  I guess being smart has nothing to do with common sense.  Three, why wouldn't you just follow the that you ran into on five different occasions?  Everyone knows that if you follow water down stream it eventually comes out someplace, and that beats being lost in a woods any day.  The move just didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.In conclusion, this film just didn't do much for me.  It wasn't that scary, and the characters weren't very bright.  For me the only thing that saved the film was the acting!  I can only give it 4 out of 10 stars.  And that's simply for great acting.",1,0,2,2 August 1999
