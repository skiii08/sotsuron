Alien 3," The quiet one in the series
","Alien 3 don't even come close to the previous two masterpieces, but are still a very good and even essential piece of the puzzle. It is a mood piece, with an eerie anticipation lingering in every nook and cranny throughout.
No need to laud Sigourney Weaver (possibly the best and most consistant actress in history), but Charles Dance deserve special mention!",8,1,1,24 January 2019
The Death of Stalin," A '10', if ever there was one!
","This movie is so perfect in scenography, script, acting and timing that it is beyond belief!
The amount of detail, fantastic acting and superb dialog is staggering!
I seldom rate anything higher than 8, as I reserve 9 for the very best, and 10 for absolute masterpieces. This is one of them!",10,1,1,28 July 2019
Alien: Resurrection," A more than worthy sequel
","Despite being the fourth installment to the series, and thus being up against some pretty stiff competition, AND basically repeating a sequence of events we've already seen three times now, this movie succeed by having great storytelling and action, a believeable character gallery, superb acting from everyone involved, and adding just enough new twists.
Sure, getting it as perfect as the two first Alien movies is impossible for many reasons. First, if you're not Ridley Scott or James Cameron, then you're not Ridley Scott or James Cameron. Second, it has all been done before, and there is a limit to how many times Ripley can believably fight off these things. That's why it is very important to devote some time and effort into creating a believeable backdrop and motivation for her. Which I think all the sequels have done exceptionally well. Every time she is placed in the middle of the action against her will, this time actually being alive against her will.
If this happened to be the first Alien movie, many more would not think twice about giving it 10 stars.",8,0,1,25 January 2019
Interstellar," Hollywood 'Blockbuster'; Star Wars meets E.T. - trying to be 'deep' -flick
","Not impressed. Mediocre acting, mainly from the three protagonists on the ship, and the tear jerking: 'love is a natural force pervading the universe'-crap, not to mention the wise-ass cowboy dialogue and the robot looking like a modern multi-function fridge and obviously meant to be a cross between C3PO and HAL9000, blew this movie for me.OK, trying to be serious; The story and idea IS a great one! Alas aimed at the masses, and thus poorly executed.The result is shallow, and it rushes things to the point of you feeling you must have slept through important plot scenes.I simply did not find the acting and dialogue believable. I mostly get the feeling that they are trying too hard! They REALLY want to make a great SciFi in the big league, but end up with an emo-version of 'Independence day'.Having seen, and been amazed by, masterpieces like '2001 A Space Oddysey', 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner', I must honestly say that the score of over 8 by a million voters here is way to high! (Lots of youngsters there I think)This is simply an entertaining action movie with a 'message'. Not a GREAT science fiction movie that will stick with you like any of those mentioned above. I gave it a 4, although based on the action and effects alone, it could easily be a 6! But here, just as with 'Star Wars', there's to much childish crap going on that detracts.",4,2,3,1 December 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Tolkiens world revisited?
","If you haven't read Tolkien's masterpiece; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever! If you have however... After having read the books several times, over many years, I have come to love the characters and story, and feel I Know it intimately. I have my own personal vision of The Shire, Hobbiton and the character-gallery. Thus for me the movie was a disappointment. Why? It dictates the appearance of the characters (unavoidably), it changes events, it removes important storyline, it removes not-so-important storyline. Great chunks of what makes The Lord Of The Rings what it is, is simply ignored. Even 2001 special effects can't do Tolkien's (and your own) imagination justice. Peter Jackson has made an honest attempt at the impossible, and I don't think anyone else could have done it better! But the fact remains, I regret seeing the movie. The next time I read The Lord Of The Rings, Peter Jackson's limited vision will leap forward, not my own.",2,3,6,29 December 2001
Split," An original premise with great potential
","Absolutely a watchable and entertaining movie, but with a great opportunity wasted: Any chills, thrills, or depth, is talked to death with an endless stream of selfconscious, pseudopsycological, pretentious and most often nonsensical babble.
Much like a Lars Von Trier movie, it tries to hard to be philosofical, artsy, clever and deep. But trying will never get you there.
The target audience will most certainly gape in awe at this barrage of profoundeties (something the average rating suggests), but I'm not impressed.
The acting never exceed average, and the cinematography too often resort to basic cliches, but on the whole it's not a waste of time.",4,0,2,24 January 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Well above average childrens adventure
","What really stands out in this movie, is the effects. They are of course state of the art. But the acting is surprisingly good also. The movie is a tad too long, and somewhat heavvy on the long dwelling shots of old scenery.",6,1,3,17 October 2018
Yesterday," Good idea! At times entertaining but mostly silly
","There's much to like about this movie! But I can't help wish I'd seen it when I was twelve. But then the Beatles point would've been lost on me.
Come to think of it: Had they swapped The Beatles out with Justin Bieber in this film, they would've had a BLOCKBUSTER on their hands! Baby baby baby, oooh....",4,3,13,28 June 2019
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Burton an Depp takes it too far as usual
","Certainly this remake outdoes the original, and is somewhat more faithful to the great novel. But there's some serious flaws that prevents this from being a definitive version: The use of incessant and bizarre flashbacks is confusing and mostly lost on children.
Also, Depp's constant arrogance, sneering rudeness, and plain sillyness destroys the aloof authority he should have, and is absolutely not the way Willy Wonka carries himself in Roald dahl's book.
To me, all this ruins the warmth, the anticipative mystery, and the tingling magic you experience reading, or being read to, the book.
But all in all, a nice try! With lots of fun and Oompa loompa singing and dancing. But miles from what it should have been!",5,1,4,19 April 2019
Steve Jobs," I really like this film for its realism and dialogue
","My first thought when seeing Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs was 'Whaat, he doesn't look like him at all!' My next thought, two seconds later: 'He's PERFECT!'
This movie may not be historically accurate, or a pinnacle of art, but it is thought-provoking, smart, and great fun! Especially the dialogue are a never ending string of carefully crafted sentences. And most, just like the Tag-Line 'Can a great man be a good man?', leaves you thinking.",7,0,1,3 August 2019
