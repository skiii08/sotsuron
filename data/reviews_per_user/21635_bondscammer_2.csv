Hereditary," Horror Or Family Melodrama?
","While containing elements that are certainly horrific to the audience experience, this film may play better as a psychological thriller of the effects of trauma, grief and mental illness within a multi-generational family.
Classify it however you want, one thing is for sure, Toni Collette will be (deservingly) nominated within the Best Actress category at the Oscars, Golden Globes, etc., this coming Awards season!",8,1,2,3 September 2018
A Star Is Born," A Worthy Tho Faulty Remake
","Coopers version of ASIB, works on the chemistry between he and Ladt Gaga, who is wonderful.
The issue may be a budgetary one. Has anyone noticed the film is shot almost entirely in close-ups?
Even the opening concert scene, filmed at Coachella 2017, is fleeting and besides any name for the venue being given, where the heck does this film take place? Bradley??!
I do appreciate the many little touches Bradley incorporated (the eyebrows scene to name one).
But, the film largely works on the marvellous chemistry between Cooper and Gaga, who shines in this dramatic leading role, and she is the worthy modern version of Esther Hoffman (the daughter of the '76 couple??) tho, as terrific as Lady Gaga is, and who has a beautiful, powerful voice, nothing touches the razor sharp glorious voice of Streisand
A worthy remake hampered by stylistic constraints
and the fact no one can touch Streisand's vocal range and clarity.",8,0,0,18 December 2019
