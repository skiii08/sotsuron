The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," What the bloody hell did I just watch?
","The films starts with the wedding invitations, progresses to the wedding itself, after which (skeleton) Stewart and Patterson ('The Hair') will go on a honeymoon, where Stewart will get pregnant, and she eventually almost dies. That's it. Two hours, and that's it. After the first part I've found myself thinking that it wasn't as boring as I expected it to be, in all honesty. But then I thought about it, and realized it's just like going to McD or BK (or any places like this). You go there because you fancy a hamburger or cheeseburger, take your pick. While you're eating it, you think it's not bad, but afterwards you're wondering, what was it that I ate? What is that hamburger made of, and that cheese tasted like garbage... It's exactly the same with this film. You watch it because you fancy a nice, emotional, non-intellectual random film. Afterwards, you'll find yourself thinking: what the *** was this? The first hour mainly contained Stewart and Patterson making out, and making out, and making out even more! Not even at the wedding Stewart looked happy, nor at the honeymoon. I was disappointed by the cheekiness of the film, especially the first half. It was so bad! Seriously, take a bowl, you're going to puke. And not because of the amount of blood, because frankly it's hardly there. The second part,I admit was slightly better. Lautner was also disappointing to me, though, his acting doesn't come through to me. It just stays on the screen. The wolf part was actually quite cool, where Lautner would stand up for Stewart and her child, and when he could hear voices. But the vampires fighting with the wolves? Not so much, I found myself thinking: whatever. Seriously. Awkward when Patterson realized that Lautner had imprinted on his daughter. If I were a father, I'd freak out. Honestly, he fell in love with Stewart, who is his age, and then falls in love with her daughter? I wouldn't sound cool. At all. The best part was the transformation. How on the outside, she lookes dead, and the shots from her veins, where you see the venom spread, is very well done. Well done, Condon, I knew you had it in you. Please, show more of your incredible director skills in the next part. Frankly, you can do so much better than this.",2,11,14,8 December 2011
The Hunger Games," Not a waste of your time
","The Hunger Games. Now, to start this off, I did not read the books. I will not make any remarks on adaptation.On the whole, I thought this film was generally good. I didn't get the hype, and quite frankly, I was afraid it was going to be another teen hype, with Twilight as its ancestor. However, I saw the trailer, and I heard a variety of comments telling me that it was nothing like a classic teen movie. Voices told me it was suspenseful, it was good, and it was in a way, terrifying.Now I'm not sure about the terrifying part, although I must say, seeing films, reading about historical events and reading experiments, I'm always surprised by the human mind. People would go into all ends to save their own skin. This story portrayed this well, though maybe that's more to thank Suzanne Collins for than the makers of the film.I believed that the story was indeed, suspenseful. It started off, introducing the main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) and the district. From this, you could conclude that district 12 is poor in comparison to the rest of the world, and you could see that Katniss was a tough, young and adventurous young woman. This didn't last in my eyes. The character development was in some ways not very strong. Katniss went from a strong, independent, young woman to a woman who'd trust too quickly. In the end of the film, I believed her to be weak. Furthermore, you didn't get to know the other characters at all, save from Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and Rue (Amandla Stenberg). I didn't care who died and who lived, save from the latter (Rue), who in my eyes, did a wonderful job of portraying a strong girl, brave until the very end.I did get amazed by the reality of it all, considering the story. People going crazy on the outside, publishers doing anything to keep it interesting and tributes who'd do literally anything to save there own skin. I was content to see that this was not merely a love story, and that it actually involved some visible killing (since that was where the hunger games were all about wasn't it? Killing and survival). I also like the cinematography. The camera-work was wonderful, creating that shaking effect whenever something was happening (think running, bombs and killing). However, occasionally, it was too rushed, too shaking. Even though you did get to see the killing, it left loads of it up to your own imagination. Bit pitiful, you didn't get to see what was really going on at that exact moment.But overall, I think this was not a waste of my time. It isn't always the case, but in this film, the suspense weighed more than the faults. - That's why I've given it a royal 7/10.",7,0,3,3 October 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Worthy
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part II was in one word: awesome. First of all the cinematography, the visual effects and the directing was great. Second, the acting. Emma, Rupert and Daniel were once again great, and then yet again nothing special. It were the others that made it. Ralph Fiennes was the star, while he put down Lord Voldemort in a magnificent way. And frankly, it wasn't just him that set the tone, Alan Rickman was great (and interesting to see how Snape too has emotions), Maggie Smith was wonderful and didn't we all just love Matthew Lewis as Neville? Rarely have I seen a movie which was thrilling and seated me on the edge of my very uncomfortable cinema seat, from the very beginning. I must say I think it can be quite hard to act when 'under influence of' the Polyjuice potion, but I reckon that Helena Bonham Carter did a great job as pretending to be Hermione pretending to be Bellatrix. Unfortunately there were some lows in this film too, for example a minor plot error occurred when Harry, Ron and Hermione entered the Room of Requirement with Neville. Cho was there, and I couldn't help but wonder, why? After all, she was a year older than Harry was, and should've had her NEWT's during Harry's sixth year. I was lightly disappointed that there were only hints given to Dumbledore's past, rather than telling the story itself. In my opinion, this story forms Albus and Aberforth in a way in which we missed out on in this film. Another low for me were the deaths of Bellatrix and Voldemort, shattering to pieces. To me, just plain dropping death would've been enough. I would've preferred seeing the film in 2D, rather than 3D, as I did. It didn't add anything special, instead it just tires your eyes. And lastly, I just didn't enjoy the epilogue. It was awkward, not just for the audience to watch, but also for the actors to play, or so it looked like on screen. Harry's little dialogue with his son made me, and others in the audience groan. But to set this aside, David Yates has done a wonderful job, and the script was overall very well done. The film made you bite your nails and close your eyes in the most thrilling parts of the movie, and then yet again you burst out into laughter at some of those parts. I can honestly say, it was absolutely worthy of my time and money.",8,7,15,13 July 2011
