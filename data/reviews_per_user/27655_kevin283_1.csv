The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Saw this movie at a private screening last night, one word, AMAZING!,
","I saw this movie at a private screening last night, one word, AMAZING!, Boy, was I surprised how much I enjoyed watching this film. I am actually really glad I didn't see any trailers or it would have spoiled some of the movie like most trailers do. It's great to see Breaking Dawn changing the whole meaning of the twilight saga , i'm not a fan of twilight but this one made me cry ! It's very emotional and amazing unlike the others , Breaking Dawn Is the real meaning of Love What i really can't understand how some haters rated the movie 1/10 before watching it ! this is so bad !Real men watch Twilight Cause they're not afraid toï»¿ admit thats its good ..anyways i don't want to spoil the movie but i promise you won't regret it",10,51,137,6 November 2011
