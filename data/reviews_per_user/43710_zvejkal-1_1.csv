Scarface," Excellent movie and main actor performance
","Impresive Pacino's performance - If someone says 'bad guy', then Pacino was the BAD guy I will never forget. If someone will ever rob me on the street I will laugh at him and say to him: 'Hay man, you wanna know how the real bad guy really looks like? Just watch this movie, man... and come next time over, when you're ready' :)What a contrast to me - I saw the the Dog Day Afternoon one day before I saw Scarface - these two characters were so extremely different, I can hardly believe it that one man can play both.The second best impression from this movie is the musical soundtrack but nevertheless, the only thing you will really remember is the Al Pacino. Anything else just flows away ... irrelevant.",9,1,3,4 April 2006
