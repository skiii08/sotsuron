"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Better in pieces
","Amusing comedy thats better in its parts than as a whole concerning Simon Pegg who bails on his wedding day to his pregnant fianc√©. Several years later as his ex becomes engaged to an annoying Hank Azaria he realizes that he really does love her and decides to run a marathon to prove his love to his girl and that he is a man to himself. Along the way he's helped along by his son and an odd gaggle of friends. I liked this I didn't love it. I think the odd mix of American (director Schwimmer and Azaria) and British (everything else) wobbles the film and keeps Simon Pegg trapped in a nether world between the two. There are these odd tonal shifts as you have say a finely crafted scene of Dylan Moran and his friends playing poker that works like a great Brit com, and then you have some of the scenes with Azaria where the film seems needlessly loud and boisterous in a decidedly American way. Its jarring and it prevented me from wholly enjoying the film. No its not a bad film but its not satisfying. there is much to love, most of the cast is excellent, with Dylan Moran as Pegg's friend a real stand out.For me it was a pleasure not to have him fade into the background as he has done with most of his movie roles. Many of the jokes are laugh out loud funny since all of the pieces are there but it just doesn't come together. Worth a shot on DVD or cable . Though DVD is probably better where the rewind will help you catch the choice lines",7,4,6,26 May 2008
The Benchwarmers," Not as bad as the reviews this is a crude but funny heartwarming movie that shows signs it could have been great
","The plot of this movie has three 'loser' adults taking on a series of snotty little league teams in order to prove that nerds can be winners.With all of the negative publicity I truly expected to hate this film, but surprising I found it an okay way to spend 90 minutes. The idea is somehow clever. Don't ask me why but I found the idea intriguing. More intriguing is the fact that Rob Schneider and David Spade (despite his haircut) manage to turn in real performances (Jon Heder isn't much of anything with much of his performance reduced to picking his nose). I really liked this movie and what it was trying to do.For me the problem with the movie lies in the fact that some one made the choice to go for big gross laughs. I'm reasonably certain that if they had managed to reign in some of the silliness they might have manged to turn in a movie that both critics and people who like booger jokes could love.Despite the critics I think this movie is worth a shot, on cable if nothing else.",5,0,1,19 April 2006
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Don't even think about thinking since this film makes no sense. Take it as being just clever action scenes and remarks strung together and you'll have a good time
",It begins with the search to prove that Nicholas Cage's great grandfather wasn't part of the plot to kill Lincoln and ends up a quest for a city of gold. In between there is lots of chases and action sequences.What can I say? How can I accurately or critically comment on this film.? I don't think its possible. Its a big wind up toy of a movie thats sound and fury signifying nothing. The plot is so silly and the plot points so unbelievable that it makes the first film look like deeply crafted Umberto Eco novel. I was constantly wondering how it was that no one had ever found the writing on the model of the statue of liberty or the hidden numbers on the desks or...must I go on? Even I if I must I won't.Its a loud noisemaker of a film that you either give yourself over to or you go mad. Great if you want to take you brain out at the door and smash it with a large gold brick. The lines are witty and the motion pretty but its so vapid as to be beyond reason. In the right frame of mind its dynamite.5 out of 10 simply because its a movie where your mileage will vary.,5,6,8,2 March 2008
Angels & Demons," Enjoyable, incredibly silly and not very clever. The actors and most of the set pieces carry the film when the plot fails
","(There are potential spoilers below) Based on the book that precedes The DaVinci Code this film follows Robert Langdon as he tries to sort out an evil plot that involves the kidnap and murder of four Cardinals and plot to blow up the Vatican via an anti matter explosion. Once more Langdon has scant hours to unlock the secrets of the mystery and save the lives of the people in Rome.I really disliked the Da Vinci Code. I found it slow and dull and very silly. This is a better movie that is fast paced, occasionally exciting and very silly.Okay if you think about the amount of time that they have to unlock the secret of whats going on you'll find its really not possible. Basically all of the events happen in four or five hours and its not enough time. Add to it the fact that what the plot requires is so incredibly laughable that you really can't believe it. I have no doubt that this would work as a book where words can be used to gloss over or redirect the silliness of it all, but as a movie where its stark reality you really can't hide how dumb much of it is. So many times all that needed to happen was for one person to say something obvious then it would all collapse.(I won't even get into the fact that you'd have to be blind not to realize who the bad guy is the minute he walks on screen) That said its a reasonably enjoyable film.I know that may shock you but there is enough to the story that you may very well get hooked into the tale. Certainly most of the set pieces work unto themselves (with the exception of the incident with the cops and the fountain). There are some incredibly beautiful images (the nature of which I dare not reveal lest I reveal plot points). When the film works and you manage not to think about how dumb much of plot is its actually worth a bucket of popcorn. I and my dad both enjoyed the film on a pure entertainment level. That said I didn't need to pay 11 bucks to see this and think either DVD or cable is the way to go.",6,1,8,17 May 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Dull
","After the explosive ending of Kill Bill: Volume 1 this movie is a major let down. Granted Volume 1 took a while to get going, but once it got firing there was no stopping it. Or so I thought.I don't care what anyone says this film is a series of sequences that are in desperate need of editing. This movie just goes on and on and on. Its a mess.Actually this film has only one problem and that it insists on filling fill in the blanks concerning every single character, whether it  moves the plot or not. Several of these sequences could be so much shorter, but Quentin instead insists on letting them play out until you want to snooze.
Worse this film insists on copying god knows how many film styles, a flaw the first film over came. Most of the styles didn't need to have them paid homage.I will not discuss the ending which goes on to the point of boredom, I dislike it and I'll leave it at that.Perhaps this will play better as seen as one long 5 hour film, but I doubt it.4 out of 10.",4,13,24,12 August 2004
Black Swan," Over hyped film is a mess of horror movie and drama conventions over done and badly put together.
","Young dancer is given the chance to dance in Swan Lake and pushed by pressures of her life and of the production she goes off the deep end.A ballet movie made almost entirely of close-ups of Natalie Portman's face. I know we are suppose to be getting into the characters mind but this is ridiculous. Its all face and feet and little else.Why you would cast some one to be a dancer and then never show her dance is one of the great mysteries that are presented by this film.Actually there is much about that this film that eludes me, mostly doing as to why the film is receiving the acclaim it has when it's so deliberate and artificial that one can never connect with it. Nominally a psychological drama with slips into to horror the films horrific elements are obvious and so over done that even the most hackneyed of horror directors would not have used all of the tropes this way (from over done music to doublings to any number of other things). The film is a mess.I've seen it twice now and I still don't get what people are seeing in it.",3,17,41,9 January 2011
Changeling," What starts as a tale of a mother looking for her child becomes a larger tale of police run amok
","(Spoilers Ahead) Clint Eastwood's first of two films for 2008 is a large scale story of a woman looking for her son and what happens when she collides with the the people who are suppose to be keeping the peace and protecting the innocent.Based on what is known as the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders but with some changes to the events, the film is nominally the story of Christine Collins, a single mother who's son Walter goes missing. Collins played by Angelina Jolie does everything she can to draw attention to her plight in the hopes that someone will help her find her son. When a Boy across the country turns up saying he is her son she is at first thrilled, until the boy arrives on the train and she instantly realizes that the boy isn't her own. No one will listen to her except Rev. Gustav Briegleb, played by John Malkovich. Briegleb has it in for the police and their tactics and he uses his pulpit and his radio show to take them to task. However as time goes on Mrs Collins is seen as a problem and is promptly sent to a mental institution. From there the story spins out as it comes to light that the fate of Walter may not have not a pleasant one and the plight of Christine reverberates on a larger scale.Oddly promoted to focus on the Christine Collins story which is the line through the story on which everything hangs, this is actually a much larger story than is advertised. Most of the scenes that were used to promote the film come from the first hour, during which time the focus is squarely on Jolie. The second half of the film focus's on the discovery of the murders and how that coupled with the publicity about Christine shake Los Angeles and its police force.Angelina Jolie is good, but not great as Christine Collins. I do feel for her and her plight but there are times I found the performance, like some of the first hour, rather one note. I do think the problem is not so much with Jolie rather with director Eastwood (and writer J.Michael Straczynski) who is a much too lax in the telling of the early part of the story. I found that I could guess the shots he was going to use and I knew what we'd see, say a young boy running out side the trolley. He's using clich√©s to set up a complex story and it hurts the film since there are times the film doesn't feel special. Unfortunately Jolie's performance never fully recovers and its only in the final passages of the film that I think she recovers her footing.About an hour in as the story begins to move away from the Jolie story and we begin to see how larger forces are at work. First there is a dangerous killer on the loose and secondly the police begin to have to backtrack and circle the wagons to protect themselves. Its here on the larger stage that the film begins to come to life. certainly the story of Christine and her search for Walter remains the primary focus, but the story takes on larger implications which make the film very much better.The film varies from the actual story in a couple of ways which I won't get into here since that would spoil things if you haven't seen the movie.To be honest I had a hard time getting through the first hour of this film. There were moments where I cared but for the most part I kind of felt I knew where it was going. I don't blame it on knowing the story, rather I think its because, as I said earlier, most of the promotional material, clips and stills and such, all come from the first hour. Its like watching a movie after the commercial gave everything away. However once the second hour rolls around and the story begins to move away from the scenes that I had seen a dozen times before the film picks up momentum and cruises along nicely to the end.This is a good film by Eastwood and worth seeing. I don't think its one of his best films, but then again it doesn't have to be.7 ish out of 10.",7,6,10,5 December 2008
Come and See," One of the greatest war films ever made
","I needed to have two hours and twenty odd minutes to watch this with out interruption. I didn't want to break it for any real reason or for any real length of time other than to change the disc (more on that later).I had the time so I watched the movie.I could argue that with two small flaws this is one of the greatest anti-war films ever made.This is the SUBJECTIVE story of a boy who joins the partisans during the German invasion of Russian and his decent into hell.This is a tough movie. its in your face and everyone else's, literally as we see everyone and everything that our hero does even to the point that if he's talking to someone the camera will hold on them as they speak with no cut aways. We learn everything about people by their faces since we have the time to study them. This is simply one of the few times where even if the film had had a different aspect ratio other than 1.33 (tv shape) I would rally to have it full screen rather than letterbox simply because for this movie you MUST lose yourself in what you see and hear. Having someone facing you, looking at you is more powerful when all you can see is their face. Faces are a landscape in this film.This is especially true of Floyra, our hero who's stunned expression at all that happens around him is a constant source of wonderment.As we as shocked and rattled by what we see we know that he is even more rattled because he is there and he is expressing it on his face. Its said he was hypnotized to be able to get the right expressions, and seeing the pain on his face I believe it since you could only express what he is by living through it... Wide eyed numbness his mouth sometimes agape we watch as he tries to just get on...The film as I said is subjective and we see and hear, literally, what Floyra does. When his hearing is thrown askew by shelling what we hear becomes less distinct. Sound will drift in and out and we get a sense of being there. The camera also holds on some scenes at times Not cutting away for better angles simply because Floyra doesn't have them.This film will rock your world and then some.I want to tell you everything about the film but at the same time fear that doing so will set up expectations as to what happens. Reading the material on the film and seeing the trailer set up some expectations in my mind, some of which was right and some was wrong. I would like to have you see the film knowing as little about what actually happens as possible so you experience the film straight. I lost my expectations the minute the film began and I was wondering what was going on... I was hooked as the long strange trip took over. I'm certain that once the film stats you will be free of expectations too but, at the same time I think if I told you too much it would ruin the what happens next.This is GREAT film making.That said there are two small flaws.First, as some reviews have said the Germans, when they finally show up on screen are just a tad cartoony. menacing but slightly cartoonish...I could be wrong... but regardless through it all Floyra's pained expression cuts the cartoon away and reminds us this is bad stuff going down.The second flaw is a montage of actual footage used near the very end. I know why it was done, or can guess, but its too long. It breaks the spell in some ways... I think it would have been more apt had the film had the original desired title of 'Kill Hitler'.The last point I want to make is the fact the film is on two DVDs. Released two years ago there is no logical reason for the film to be broken into two parts, the tape is a single cassette release, except that like many films from the Russian Film Council its loaded with subtitles, 13 languages and three audio options. There is also other extras like an introduction by the film maker that runs 20 minutes, documentary footage and an interview with the lead actor. But I digress....I'm certain that the film doesn't really need to be in two parts for any reason other than a technical one... except that in a strange way the break sort of works for the film if you watch it straight through taking only a break to switch discs. Call me crazy but the break is perfectly placed at the mid point to the story. Not only that the film changes from first half to second half. The tone , even though continuous in action, is different as the second disc begins. Its almost as if we are back at the beginning of the film at a peak that slowly slides downward. Time wise the two halves are different with the action taking place over a couple of jumbled days while the second is one continuous series of events over two days.In the end all that matters is the film.And here the film is absolutely great.See it and be moved.----------------------------------- random thoughts In its way its comparable to grave of fireflies The film that many people compare it to, Destiny of a Man, is a relation but not direct ancestor of it simply because the films are very different, Destiny taking place over years in Flashback, Come and See is happening here and now over weeks. They share themes and elements but the thrust and points are different, especially in the end...",9,21,30,19 January 2008
Scarface," 25 years on the film is now more a parody than reality
","Unintentionally Hilarious but viscerally moving about Tony Montana from Cuba who comes to the US, becomes a drug lord, a junkie and dies in a spectacular shoot out. Brian DePalma's film remaking the Howard Hawks film from the 1930's works on some levels despite being so silly as to become a comedy. Blame Oliver Stone who's script is overly ripe. And Blame the cast who over acts like there is no tomorrow.I saw the film on Christmas day 1983 and was floored by it, even though I knew some of it was silly.(I thought it was one of the best films ever made) Watching it again for the first time in a couple of years I was horrified at how bad the film is. Yea the underlying themes and such are there but its so jumbled I'm amazed that anyone takes the film seriously. I have no idea why Montana is an icon for the todays gangsters since he is such a joke, unless they don't see it that way, or perhaps its like a childhood friend who loved the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, or rather the rise, he totally ignored the fall. An important movie in the history of film simply because its become such a cultural touch stone. I think its now a violent joke.",6,6,9,22 March 2009
Frost_Nixon," Excellent
","Film version of what happened when David Frost decided to try to interview Richard Nixon. Based upon the play that played London and Broadway last year this is a top example at how to adapt a play for the screen and get something that exists on its own. Its also contains two of the best performances of the year in Michael Sheen as Frost and Frank Langella as Nixon.I saw the play twice on Broadway and there was something about seeing the sparring there, right in front of you that made it a magical night at the theater. The Langella won a Tony as Nixon in a performance that was scary to see in person because he disappeared so deeply in the role it was like Nixon on stage. It's probably one of the best things I've seen Give points to Ron Howard and his crew to taking the play and turning it into a film. To be certain there are similarities but at the same time its entirely its own animal. This is the the story of Frost and Nixon and their battle to tell the story of what happened in the Nixon White House. Sheen is amazing and even more affecting then he was on stage as Frost. We see the pain and uncertainty of a man who has thrown every little bit of himself and his fortune (and the fortunes of friends and relatives) in a gamble to become a hit once more in America. In its way its a thankless role compared to Nixon since he often seems to be just a party guy asking questions, however Sheen pulls it off making him into a person you really care about.The real story of the film is Langella. Minutes after seeing him on screen he ceases to be anything other than Nixon. (How could they have even considered Warren Beatty in the role?) Its an amazing transformation, and in some ways better then it was on Broadway where you couldn't see the details of his face. Its amazing. If you don't like Langella in the role at first wait until the end, wait until the final confrontation, watch Langella's face- watch it and I dare you to see anything other than a broken man. Watch the face in the monitors, its all there. Even watch the final shots of Nixon alone looking at the sea, its masterful physical performance.This is a wonderful film it really is. Its a film that anyone interested in a good movies should see. I don't know if its a truly great film, but it is a really good one. Certainly its one of the best of 2008.",9,3,5,6 January 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I'm seemingly in the minority, I really don't like this movie
","Sasha Cohen pretends to be a reporter visiting America and makes fun of people in the process.I understand the humor. I get the jokes. I just don't find them funny. Yes I'm in that seemingly small group of people who don't find Borat funny, or even particularly clever. No, I'm not a fan of Ali G, one of Cohen's other characters and who's show was the source of the Borat character. Forgive me the jokes aren't all that clever, it seems his jokes are low rent Monty Python malapropisms or jokes so stupid I doubt most cut rate vaudevillians wouldn't have touched them.Am I bothered by Cohen using these seemingly innocent as foils? partly because they were set up to look stupid and didn't fall into their own trap, then again my feelings are mitigated by the fact I can't believe that no one caught on (of course if they did we wouldn't see that). I am bothered by his 'I'm so much cleverer than you attitude that pervades the film. Clearly he's amused by the joke he's telling which is all that matters.I sat there stone faced for 80 minutes.",2,69,135,18 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," If Marvel hit a home run with Iron Man, this is a solid triple.
","Essentially a sequel to both the last film (Banner was in the jungle at the end of Ang Lee's film) and the TV series (Lou Ferigno and Bill Bixby have cameos and we hear the theme music) the film is also a restart of it all.As the film opens Banner is is Brazil working to try and find a cure for his problem. When the military shows up to capture him he flees and eventually heads home so that he can make contact with a scientist who is helping him via the internet. Much damage ensues.The action scenes are spectacular and much better than I thought they would be. Its great that even though we are watching what are often CGI characters running around we still have a sense of danger. Betty or any other puny human could very easily get hurt. The battles are not neat affairs and there is considerable collateral damage which plays out in little pieces on TV screens and else where once the battles are over. The battles are also epic in ways that only movies and comic books can be. Hulk is larger than life and what happens when he is engaged in battle is too.The real joy here are the characters which are invest with real weight. I've been reading the comic for decades and this is the first time that General Ross wasn't one dimensional.Kudos to William Hurt for giving us a real character. Tim Roth is a blast as Blonsky/The abomination. The real story here is Liv Tyler as Betty Ross and Edward Norton as Banner/The Hulk. We feel the weight of their relationship. We feel the love they have and that they are joined forever together. Its amazing. The feelings they have is the reason that much of the film has a real emotional weight. Its nice to have the Hulk smash things but at the same time we care about the characters. We feel the pain in the Hulks eyes when he realizes Betty is in danger. we feel the anger when someone hurts her. Its adds greatly to the film.When the film is 'on', which is most of the time, its one of the best comic films ever made.Its not just action and heroes its people and characters with real emotion. Much of the film is right on target.The problem with the film is that at times action sacrifices character and a clear plot. We're dropped into the action in such away as to make us feel that we're missing something. Yes 45 years of the comic, the TV incarnations and the Ang Lee film sort of fill things in, but at the same time its coming in on chapter two of a serial. There is also the publicized battle between Marvel and Edward Norton.Norton wanted a longer more thoughtful film and Marvel wanted this action packed cut. Give me Norton's cut. I could be wrong but there are several times as we jumped through time and space or from action scene to action scene, I got the sense that something was missing. More than once I thought a little something was lost- details mostly- that could have strengthened or deepened what we saw. For all I know this maybe the best cut of the film, but at the same time since the action works because of the characters and plot I think that the 15 or 20 minutes that Marvel chopped out could only make things better.Yes I liked it. Yes I frequently said-out loud- 'thats it thats it they got it right'. Yes it moved me.Go see it.8 out of 10 (maybe a little less but not enough so you'd notice)",8,4,7,15 June 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," A great cast has a fun time in a very good thriller.
","Slevin goes to visit his friend in New York only to find he's in the wrong place at the wrong time and before he knows whats happening he's mistaken for his friend who's disappeared and who's in deep trouble with two gangsters.Thats enough to get you started. Thats enough of the plot for you to know if you'd be interested in seeing this clever little crime thriller. Its a good little piece of film making with great performances by a everyone in the cast. It really is worth taking the time to see it.That said there is one other comment concerning the films one flaw I'd like to make and while I will keep it spoiler free I think that if you'd prefer to know nothing about the film (a good idea) you should stop reading now and move on to something else.Last chance...Still here? Okay.(Though if you want to read to the end but not know anything skip the next paragraph) As good as the movie is there is a large flaw in it, its not a fatal flaw but its the type of thing that keeps it from being a great film. The flaw is that the film thinks its much more clever than it is. Constructed as a twisty turny little thriller where nothing is as it seems this film is trying desperately to pull the wool over our eyes. The problem is that from the start we're told and shown we're going to be misdirected so we never completely settle into accepting the movie on its own terms, which is what great films trick us into doing. As I said its not fatal, but it keeps this film from being the great film it aspire to be and that it thinks it is. To be honest I had a good chunk of the movie figured out early on, and while it didn't stop me from enjoying the movie, it did stop me from loving it. I suspect that on later viewings when knowing whats going on will be a foregone conclusion this may play better.Flaw and all this is a good fun movie. I don't know if you'll love it but my guess is that you will like it. Its one of those movies that you'll end up quoting to friends and probably watching every time it runs on cable.7 out of 10",7,2,9,27 April 2006
3:10 to Yuma," A great film and one of the years best
","Its been a while since I saw this and I'm still trying to find some words.The plot concerns a noted outlaw, Russel Crowe, caught in a small town. He has to be taken to a larger city with a rail connection where he will put him on the titled train. Along for the ride is a rancher, played by Christian Bale, a slightly disgraced man with a family and mounting debts who's trying to do the right thing even though his kids and his wife don't understand him or his choices. As the men get closer to the train the run into several obstacles, not the least of which are Crowe's men who are very intent on freeing their leader, no matter what the cost.A remake of a 1957 'classic' western this updated retelling adds some shading and some violence for a creation that is uniquely its own. Violence aside this film seems to belonging more in the classic era of the western. However 'old fashioned' though it maybe in the telling (as someone said in a review its clear that no one told director James Mangold that the western was dead), the film benefits from the muddying of the moral sensibilities since things are never as clear as the may have been in a by gone time.Why anyone is doing anything is never clear, even the hero played by Bale who is clearly carrying a chip on his shoulder the size of Montana. This grayness helps to make the good guys seem better and the bad guys worse since we know that what ever choice they have made its at great personal expense.Some are hailing the film as a classic, others are liking it but not loving it. I'm really confused about it. To be certain the film is close to being, if not on, the list of best films of the year (I also keep wanting to use the term mythic, especially since it seems to shift into that mode at times). The question for me is whether its a classic or not. I've been going back and forth on the subject for the couple of hours and I still don't have an answer, which is why I can't really write about the film, even though it deserves to deeper discussion.",9,3,7,23 December 2007
Marie Antoinette," Life of the idle rich is idle
","The life of Marie Antoinette in the French court. Abandoned by her husband Marie is left to her own devices and behaves as any young rich girl her age would, she shops and gossips and tries to fill her time entertainingly.Sure to win tons of end of year awards for its technical achievements this film is rather inert dramatically. I'm sure that there is something to the story but after the shot during the opening credits of Marie lounging on a couch while a servant serves her with a 1980's song about being young and rich playing in the background there really isn't anywhere to go. That one fleeting and stunning image says more in thirty seconds then the remaining two hours does.Beginning with Marie being sent to France to be married off the film instantly kills twenty minutes as Marie rides in the carriage to the new country. We watch for the better part of twenty minutes as she rides, changes and meets the in-laws. We then get the wedding (beautifully shot) and the wedding night, which is a real scream. After that Marie finds herself alone and we get some rather obvious montages set to a 'modern rock' score. While I can admire say a sequence like where Marie shops to Bow Wow Wow's I Want Candy, I can also be frustrated by the fact that song has been used other times in exactly the same way. This film doesn't do anything new, or rather it does but pushes them to the background. The small bits where we see life in the court, and the ridiculous nature of it (ie. the wedding night, or allowing Marie to freeze as they determine who is the right person to hand her her clothes) are more interesting than everything else. Perhaps someone will take up the challenge and construct an interesting movie about that.As it stands now we have a beautiful movie, with occasional flashes of interesting material. Worth seeing if you're into opulent rich girl behavior, everyone else should wait for video.",5,1,2,2 November 2006
The Ring," Slow Version of a Slow Original
","The pacing of both the original and English remake of the Ring seems to be rather slow. While there are some creepy moments in this version of the story its still as over rated as the original. For the most part the two films are almost interchangeable in my mind, although the images from the cursed tape is better in this version. The only real differences being the location and the episodes around Brian Cox.The question of which is better ultimately comes down to whether you want to read subtitles or not. For me there is something creepier about the original version and its lack of digital effects that makes the final several minutes of this version less scary because its less real, but thats a minor complaint and either version is fine.",6,1,2,7 March 2004
Stop-Loss," One of the best film about troops returning from Iraq suffers from 'Iraq film clich√©s'. If you haven't seen many Iraq films this is the place to start
","After a tour of duty in Iraq that almost kills him a soldier returns home only to find that he's going to have to go back as part of the Stop Loss program of the military thats being used to keep numbers of troops up.Good, earnest, well acted tale is one of the better Iraq films to come out. That said I don't know if that really means much. Watching the film I'm forced to wonder if anyone is capable of making a great (or even totally good from start to finish) film about the war. Don't get me wrong its not bad, but on some level haven't we, or I, seen this all before? Its very much like any number of other war films, and while the high quality of the acting and the direction do count for much there was a moment where I forgot what I was watching because it all blended together with all the other Iraq films.The opening Iraq scenes kind of doomed the film for me, since while they are well done, they are like any number of other films that have come out recently.They particularly reminded me of Home of the Brave with Samuel L Jackson-as did a chunk of the rest of the film. There is such a lack of imagination concerning Iraq scenes now that I was thinking that they make up 'The banality of the Iraq war'. Forgive me but what I see on You Tube and elsewhere looks better than this, it all looks more real (yes I know it is). I even prefer chunks of Brian De Palma's Redacted (which I hate), to the same patrol shots with the same sort of attacks, with the same GI bull crap.I'm getting off on a tangent here- ultimately this is a good, but not great film thats worth a look. Though I have a feeling that if you haven't seen a good number of Iraq films see this one since its one of the best (with the Valley of Elah)",5,3,9,31 May 2008
United 93," Its well made, but it left me feeling empty
","The story, as best as we can tell, of what happened on Flight 93 which crashed on September 11 2001 when the passengers attempted to fight back against the hijackers of the plane.This is an extremely well made and well acted film. Its a film that pretty much puts you into the plane on 911. Its emotional and heart breaking. As a docudrama of what may have happened its a great film.The problem for me was that I walked out of the film feeling extremely empty. Why have the film makers chosen to retell and re-speculate as to what exactly happened on the plane yet again? There have been the how many documentaries and at least one TV movie that covered the same ground. The film makers here have added nothing new except a big screen and big sound. The film essentially covers the moments before the flight and the flight itself and only puts the events in the confines of that narrow time period on that day, which for me added nothing new about anyone or anything. I stopped caring about twenty minutes in and simply braced myself for the body blows that were going to be coming.I don't see the point of telling this story yet again. Actually the only reason for me is purely exploitive, its like those nasty made for TV movies about horrible tragedies that seem to be made just to make you watch and be upset. This isn't to say its a bad movie, its not, its just a completely unnecessary one since it doesn't add anything to what we know or have learned from the other versions of the story. What bothers me is that there have been so many re-tellings now that the effect or 'shock and awe' is beginning to wear off. How many more will there be before we simply shrug and go 'oh thats nice' dismissively? I don't think I can really recommend this film to anyone other than those who don't know the story of what happened on 911. Granted that recommendation comes with a warning about the emotional pain this movie will probably cause you. If you've seen anything on this flight you may want to skip it, it will add nothing to what you already know, and it will only end up making you feel bad, something you can do on your own by thinking back to that fateful day.",5,5,10,7 May 2006
Kung Fu Panda," Charming
","Po is a big panda who dreams of being a great warrior. One day when the search for the Dragon Warrior is announced-Po heads off to see who is chosen, never dreaming that he will be chosen to be the hero and forced to fight a terrible villain.Charming wonderful marvelous animated film from Dreamworks is possibly the best cartoon they have put out. Essentially a really good martial arts film with animals this film scores where earlier films like Shrek failed in that the point of the film is the story and not the one liners. Yes there are clever lines but its the characters and the story that are paramount.The real story here is the voice cast which is perfect. Jack Black has a wonderfully modulated performance that isn't too much. As for the rest of the cast Angelina Jolie,Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, Lucy Liu, Jackie Chan and Michael Clarke Duncan all disappear into their parts so well that for the most part I had no idea who was voicing which part.I loved this movie a great deal and it was great seeing what is essentially a father and son story on Father's day.You really should see this.",9,4,8,15 June 2008
Star Trek," Possibly the best of the Trek movies, its one of the best films of the year
",So far its the best American movie I've seen from this year. It's amazing.The film is a restart of the original series within continuity-yes the film connects to all of the other series and movies- and then heads off in its own way. The characters can now be what they were and potentially grow in new directions.The plot has a time tripping Romulan named Nero seeking revenge for the destruction of Romulus by traveling back in time to get the person he feels was responsible for the event- Spock. Of course there are complications as in the person he seeks to kill is merely a child... As the story unfolds the characters we all know and love come on stage and do there thing. Its wonderful.I had a blast and was laughing at all of the jokes and references and things that were spot on. Clearly JJ Abrams and his writers know and love the source and they don't rip things apart willie nillie. (I have been a fan since I was in diapers during the original run so this stuff runs in my blood) Very recommended on as big a screen as possible.I'm planning on going back.,9,11,29,8 May 2009
The Birth of a Nation," Wrong on many levels the film still has the power to make you think and feel
","Sat down to watch the longest version of the DW Griffith epic I had ever had in my possession, a version running around three hours and ten minutes. Clearly racist, even if it was never intended to be, the film is not really possible to defend on any sort of racial grounds because it was wrong in the day it was made (it really angered many people right out of the box-and it amazes me that Griffith would ever have thought that people wouldn't have been upset) and it still angers people today .Its a mind trip movie and while its aged badly it still has a great deal of power. Its the power in a the creaky old bones that has people still turning apoplectic when ever the film is screened because you want to cheer when the hero rides to the rescue, even though we really shouldn't. Remember that this is the film that manged to change everything about film, culture and history. yes the Italians were doing grand epics and yes the bits and pieces of what we know as cinema were floating around, but here at last it was all put together. a Huge story told in the most modern way. Certainly Griffith's story telling ability is stilted, it always was and always would be, but the way he put sequences together, especially in the later part of the film, changed the way movies were seen. Essentially this erratic film helped speed us to the present.The film as entertainment is a mixed bag. Some of the sequences are so horribly stilted that they are near unwatchable. The black face make-up is bad, never mind offensive, its just poorly done.(and if you think anyone can justify, even remotely the portrayal of the African Americans you must be mad) The main story of the two families is horribly melodramatic. But at the same time there is something about the film that keeps you watching. The sequences of real life events are mesmerizing, the battle and action sequences (Including the Klan to the rescue) are spectacular and if they seem clich√É¬© its only because they have been stolen thousands of times. And as melodramatic as the family story is you do manage to become invested in the romance. The film actually works as an entertainment, even if its uneven (which is what angers many people-they get involved and hate themselves for it). Yes I like the film, though to be perfectly honest I prefer shorter versions of the film since the three plus hour version I saw last evening was just too damn long and I hit the scan button a couple of times.Is the film worth seeing. Yes. Though understand what you're getting into a film from another time and place that is a creaky as they come and really morally questionable, but still manages to be watchable. See it if for no other reason as to understand where movies came from and to understand the mind set of the worst kind of racism, the sort that doesn't realize its racist.",7,8,14,12 July 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Okay send up of the Euro-war film is for fans of Tarantino's dialog only
","Quentin Tarantino's painfully over long World War Two film that started as a remake of Enzo G. Castellari's Inglorious Bastards, but which changed over time to this monster of a movie.The plot has a band of American soldiers, all Jewish, operating behind enemy lines killing Nazi's when the opportunity comes to work with a British officer who's job it is to kill a large portion of the high command at a film premiere in Paris.The film is essentially a long winded send up, you can't take anything in this film seriously so its a send up, of the Euro- war films of the 1970's and 80's. Indeed the film that the movie takes its name from is from 1978. To be certain the film has better production values than most of the films that he is sending up but it isn't all that much better than the most mediocre of the genre.What went wrong? Tarantino is what what went wrong. To be certain Tarantino knows his war films and the film very often feels like it fits very nicely in the genre, I'm currently going through a good number of Italian war films and from a feel point of view this film does get it right. His rip offs and borrows, of which there are many, mostly work (even if they frequently break the mood).The problem is Tarantino's attitude is more is more. This is all well and good, except that the films he is sending up are at least an hour shorter than this behemoth. This film drones on for two and a half hours. It never seems to end. Actually it never seems to get going. Honestly the film is well over an hour in before the film even begins to start to move, and even that it does slowly. I kept wanting to hit the remote to get to the point where it gets moving.What is the deal with this film. Its a war film with very little action. Most of this film are these long, painfully long, sequences where the characters just sit around and talk. The opening introduction of Christoph Waltz's Col Lada is twenty minutes long. Yea it plays out in essentially real time, but at the same time I screamed 'get on with it' at the screen (yes I was shushed) because there really was no point. Actually there is little point to much of the dialog. This is a film that could be trimmed by at least an hour and lose nothing but inane dialog. (Your ultimate love or hate for the film will depend upon whether you like Tarantino's penchant for long rambling dialog exchanges that goes nowhere, or if not nowhere drone on way past the point of what is really required and serve no point beyond showing how well he can write).Which brings me back to the idea that this is an action film. How much action is there? Very little. The shoot out in the bar, the end, the introduction of the band at the train bridge (maybe thats an action scene) and maybe one other sequence, the rest is talk. To me the film felt mostly inert. Its not a film that slowly builds only to have the tension released in an orgy of violence, rather its rambling nonsense punctuated by an occasional scalping. If you really want to be fair you'd have to say that this film is static in away no Euro-war film- other than a concentration camp exploitation film- ever was.I'm curious what the tone of the film is suppose to be. After the too long but tense introduction of Lada and Shoshana, the film jumps to Brad Pitt talking to his men about what is expected of them (100 scalps). Its fall down funny. Its so over the top that you can't take anything that happens after that even remotely seriously. Forgive me it sinks the film since every time Aldo Raine comes on screen or is heard the film falls into silliness. You'll have a serious sequence and then Pitt comes on and spoils the mood.Its also troubling. Its troubling because I'm not sure what I'm suppose to take away from the film. Clearly the jovial attitude is suppose to make it easier to root for the good guys, but at the same time what they do, often in a joking manner, isn't funny. I don't think the Nazi's do anything other than shoot people, the good guys scalp people, cut their throats and beat their heads in with a baseball bat while their comrades cheer and dance around. These are the good guys? I don't think Tarantino was going for the same effect that James Dickey was going for with his novel To the White Sea (the film of which had Pitt attached) since there are too many jokes. I'm sorry the implications of what the heroes are bothers me.I do have to say that the performances, outside of the Basterds who are just too over the top, are for the most part very good. I was very impressed by Michael Meyers who has a solid cameo as a British general.Do I like the film? Kind of, but not really. Its better than I thought, but not as good as it should have been. Its a bloated approximation of the Euro-war film. Tarantino has beefed it up and disjointed it in the way that an over-imaginative five year old who is making up his own story would do. Unfortunately for Tarantino the plots of many of the films he's sending up, I will not say paying homage, are so close to parody already that he's pushed it all in the wrong direction. He's done better, and he's done worse.I can't really recommend it since its too long for what it is. Wait for DVD or cable",4,21,47,23 August 2009
Coraline," At least we'll always have the book
","Coraline moves into a new house with her parents and finds that she has other parents who love her through a small door in a wall.Neil Gaiman's neo-classic children's (YA?) book comes to the screen from Laika Studios and specifically Henry Selick as one of the rare stop motion animated features made these days. The bonus of the film is that it was made in 3D which enhances the depth of the picture but isn't the reason to see the film (I watched about half a film with out the glasses).I'm not a fan of the film. Its okay but to be honest it kind of bored me. I don't blame the story, I liked the novel when I read it ages ago, I blame Henry Selick, who in my opinion is a lousy director when left to his own devices. (Oh come on Selick hasn't made a really good film since James and the Giant peach 13 years ago.) I'm not talking abut the animation or the set pieces (which are for the most part stunning-the theater bits rock as do several other bits) I'm talking about the tone of the film and the story construction.Tone-wise the film is rather weak. I was never scared or creeped or anything. there was never any real tension. Selick's adaption of the novel seems to have been missing something. There is a step that is missing. Things are and they start and while I'm a fan of not explaining everything, I kept thinking there was a step missing.(If I had read the novel sometime recently I might be able to tell you what it was but its too long in the past) Selick jumps too deeply into the story too fast. I never got hooked. I'm not a fan of Selick's color scheme (I always thought it should have been in black and white) and some of his designs which both overstate and understate things (The real parents are much too wimpy). Frankly Selick's visuals don't match Gaiman's words.I'm also not a fan of most of the score which in my humble is almost completely wrong.Its not a bad movie, its just not a great one...or even a scary one.I'd wait for home video (The 3D isn't spectacular enough to warrant running out)",5,8,20,22 March 2009
Dawn of the Dead," Not Your Mother's Zombie Film
","To compare the two Dawn of the Dead films is unfair. Twenty five years have passed and there is no doubt that what passes for a R rated film today would have been X rated when the original came out (and vice versa). The two films also have very little in common other than the  basic premise.Where the original film had more than being scary on its mind this new film is more concerned with building tension. The zombies, instead of being slow moving beasts of the original, move with the speed of a track star, so there really is a reason to fear them, you either kill them or they will kill you giving you no time to run. This will either thrill you or make you scream in pain. Personally I think it works since it explains why things fall apart so fast.The new film, like the old film, is not with out its flaws, they just occur in different places.If you want to see a really good horror/action film that takes its source material and does something other tan resting on its laurels with it, see this movie. However, be warned it is as bloody as the first in its own way.8 out of 10 (which is what I'd give the original)",8,2,3,20 March 2004
Iron Man 2," disappointing
","Disappointing and uneven follow up to the powerhouse of a few years ago.Jon Favreau proves that his ability to direct a solid movie isn't there. forgive me the only film of his that I think worked start to finish was the first film.The pacing is all off with whole sequences going on too long or not long enough. Honestly most of the first half is numbing with the result that I wanted to curl up and go to sleep.Realism is out the window with several sequences looking more like the sort of things we'd make fun of from 1970's movies (The race sequence prior to Iron man is just silly- though once Iron Man shows up it's note perfect. And bits of the final fight sequence screamed Conquest of the Planet of the Apes) This is a movie of pieces. the script is good, but badly directed. There a moments that are on target with the end of the race sequence excellent, The creation of Bullwhip into a real villain, Black Widow kicking ass, and other small moments that show what the film should have been. Unfortunately Favreau in putting the film together ruined it (Or was it th editor?) The performances are excellent for the most part with the exception of Paltrow who has become shrill and Sam Rockwell who has been given nothing to do so he does shtick.This will play better on DVD where you can zip past the dead spots.",3,2,3,5 June 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," not my cup of tea
","Another Judd Apatow produced film-so its another question of why did I bother seeing it when it clear I'm not going to be happy. Okay its not bad but it didn't thrill me.In a nutshell Peter is a composer for TV series. His girlfriend is Sarah Marshall the hot star of a hot cop show. She dumps him for a Lothario singer and he pines for her. He then goes off to Hawaii and ends up at the same resort that the ex and her new beau end up at. For me the problem is, as with Knocked Up, I can not understand what the two main characters, here Peter and Sarah, are doing together. Peter is a sweet schulb of a guy and she is twit, a babe but a bit shallow. What are they doing together? Or rather why is she with him in the first place? I kind of lost respect for the originality for the film when Peter is seen in one of the first scenes sitting on the couch with a huge bowl of cereal letting himself go until Sarah calls, he then goes and straightens himself out. But its been done before, why are we doing it again? Give the filmmakers points for showing Peter naked a couple of times (in places he really would be naked-which made sense to me but cause much of the audience to laugh around me, I'm guessing from nervousness) but take a good many away from not being creative enough to stay out of the clich√© rut. I did like the final bits of the film which actually seemed to have real characters and situations but I getting to that point was a chore. Its clear that the creative team can make a winning romantic film as evidenced from several of the final scenes, but for me it was too little too late.Your mileage may vary. As for me I must learn to stay away from anything Judd Apatow touches.",4,8,22,26 May 2008
The English Patient," If you can get through the first half then you'll probably love this film
","I first saw this under adverse conditions. I had just broken up with my girlfriend and needed to get away and so I went to see what ever was playing next at the multiplex. The last thing I wanted, a romantic drama, was just the thing I needed.Admittedly the first hour and half to two hours can be slow going as we hear the story of the English Patient in flashback. These are very stuffy British people who show little emotion. And then some where around the two hour mark a declaration of love and the movie explodes with emotion...This is great film making.But its so mannered that its tough to get through.Frankly I like the movie better than the book. The book tells you much up front that the movie keeps, I think wisely in reserve. In most ways the two are equal tellings of the same story, however I would be hard pressed to ever pick up the book again.If you can wait for a pay off and like romantic movies then by all means see this wondrous film. Otherwise stay away.",9,9,16,28 June 2004

Twenty years on his niece and nephew desperate for a drummer to play a prom ask him to sit in and suddenly things begin to click and the band begins to go places.Amusing comedy will depend on your tolerance for Rainn Wilson as the hero of the story. I'm not a fan and I didn't particularly love it. Your like or dislike for the film will also hinge on whether or not you find the film a bit too 'teen' oriented. For me the film seemed to be playing to the 14 year olds in the audience which made me feel left out even as I was laughing.Worth a look but wait for cable.,5,1,2,25 May 2009
Public Enemies," I'm mixed
","Johnny Depp plays Dillinger in Michael Mann's take on the gangster legend.Well acted and extremely well made with some stunning set pieces this is in a good many ways one of the best films of the year......but......damn its slow. Yes I made it all the way to the end but at the same time I had no idea where it was going. Yes I know it was going to the Biograph Theater, but at the same time I wasn't quite sure why. I think the problem is that the film, even at 140 minutes is not long enough. There are whole volumes that seem to be missing from the tale. Characters come and go and bend into one another. Melvin Purvis is a cypher. Outside of Depp's Dillinger and Marion Cotillard's Billie I knew nothing about the characters. The casting of recognizable actors like Stephen Lang or James Russo seem to import a bigger weight then they receive, though Russo's presence is strong enough to hang over the entire film. I really don't know what to make of it.Yes you will want to see this if you have a good home theater system since the shoot outs will rattle your windows, outside of that I really don't know what to say other than if you're interested give it a try. Its one one the few times I'm hoping for a directors cut of some kind.between 6 and 7 out of 10 with parts much higher.",6,0,2,26 July 2009
The Other Boleyn Girl," Not bad but not really compelling
","Second version of Philippa Gregory's novel of the Boleyn's family to assure their future by helping the King find an heir, or at least a mistress. The idea is to let Henry take Anne (Natalie Portman) as a mistress, however after a riding accident he is taken instead by the newly married Mary (Scarlett Johansen). What happens next is the movie.I'm going to plead bias in the viewing of the film. For me this is one of the films where Natalie Portman has been terribly miscast and so it became a challenge to get through. While I don't hate Portman as an actress I do find that she is often miscast to the detriment of the film she is in. Eric Bana, another one of my lesser favorite actors, as Henry actually gives a performance but he also leaves no impression what so ever. I kept wondering where the king was.The film itself isn't bad. It does seem to have the feel of a larger scale TV movie and does seem to be 'modern' in feel, the result is that a good portion of the film seems like dress up time in the English manor house. Part of this is the result of the miscasting of Portman who never seems to belong in the place on screen. I kept waiting for her to walk off the set and into a Porche and drive off. Actually to be fair I felt that way about most of the cast and the unseen crew who could be felt just out of shot.As I said its not a bad movie, its just not a particularly compelling one.",6,2,4,30 March 2008
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Disappointing sequel is a collection of good sequences with nothing real to connect them together.
","The world is going to end...or rather the ice is melting and the dam of ice that is holding back all of the water from flooding the valley our heroes live in is on the verge of collapse. The only hope for survival is to get to the far end of the valley where 'a boat is waiting'. So everyone begins the long trek to the far side. Along the way funny things happen.Major disappointment from the Ice Age gang. The voice cast is fine. The animation is fine. The problem is that there really is no plot. Its basically a series of barely connected set pieces on the road to the far end of the valley. The pieces are all okay, with some being quite good, the problem is that there isn't enough to tie them together, the romance between Ray Romano and Queen Latifah is not a thread, its shading on the walk where ever. Worse the location takes on different appearances depending on what the joke of the moment needs. Its ice, its forest, there's water, its dry, there's an ice wall there's no wall in sight. You have no sense of where anyone is or whats going on. I know its a minor thing but I kept wondering where'd the water go/ come from?, there is no internal consistency. It looks as if the film makers had all of these bits they wanted to tie together and instead of working out a real plot just put them in a stew pot.(worse, they actually make you sick to death of the acorn lusting Scrat).While not bad I don't think its worth 10 bucks in the theater.

Its nails everything the way a huge blockbuster of this sort should except in one key...nay vital area...you don't give a rat's toe about anyone.

Balls of Fury," Funny spoof of spy and martial arts movies is better on the small screen than it was on the big
","Amusing comedy staring Dan Folger who won a Tony for the 25th Annual Putnum County Spelling Bee. The film concerns a Ping Pong Tournament run by madman Christopher Walken. A spoof of films like Enter the Dragon and everyone of those spy films where the FBI or CIA use a regular Joe for a secret mission this is an amusing romp I'm glad I didn't pay big bucks to see on the big screen. Don't get me wrong its a funny movie but not worth the 11 bucks it would take to see in a theater. Dan Folger clearly is a man of limited ability,He's okay here but its clear between this and Good Luck Chuck he's headed for a limited film and TV career in supporting roles. As I said he's good the role doesn't require him to do little more than mug at the camera and he's fine, but I doubt very much he'll be able to ever really do more than that. Christopher Walken on the other hand is a scream, and its clear why he took the role, he can go as far over the top as he wants and still be amusing. The rest of the cast including veteran James Hong and comedian George Lopez is up to snuff, though Maggie Q is given little to do other than look good. Absolutely worth seeing on both DVD and cable.",7,2,2,28 December 2007
Oldboy," YES IT IS THAT GOOD
","After getting out of a hotel room like prison a man searches for answers and revenge. The description is simple, direct and probably the best way to explain this great film. Its not that a more detailed recounting of the plot would ruin it like say the Sixth Sense, or The Village, rather its simply that the plot is so layered that to know more simply may result in too much confusion.Containing a central performance that is simply one of the best performances of the last five or ten years this film is Oscar worthy from top to bottom, which is a shame since as of this writing the film has not yet been released in the United States where it would undoubtedly blow away almost any film it comes in contact with. Ultimately it is better than even the Michael Moore film it lost to at Cannes.This is grand film making and I can not recommend it highly enough.However be warned, its violent and dark at times. It will disturb you, the same way that Silence of the Lambs or Seven disturbed you (although there are no serial killers)10 out of 10.",10,30,123,13 November 2004
Spider-Man 2," Only Alfred Molina is worth watching (and worthy of an Oscar)
","I'm apparently in the minority of film goers in that I despise this film. Its simply one of the dullest, most predictable films I've seen in years, and yet people are falling all over themselves with praise for it. Which version did all these people see since it wasn't the one that played my local cinema.Basically this is a Spiderman film with out Spiderman. The Parker/MJ relationship trudges on, Osborne moans about how his father was killed by Spidey and Parker tries giving up the suit. Its dull and worst of all you know where its going. Perhaps its the trailers, or perhaps its just the conventions of the genre, but what ever it is this film is so predictable that Las Vegas is considering banning it as too sure a thing.The only joy is Alfred Molina's Doc Ock. When he is on screen you realize what this movie should have been. He is a villain of the highest order and gives a performance that Oscar will be noticing come award time.(It better or else some super villains will tear down the Academy) Molina gives the film a reason to be. Unfortunately instead of being the main thrust of the film he's  given the short end of the stick. If I did my math right he's in it for around 30 to 40 minutes, and disappears from even conversation for whole sections of the film. He's the best thing in this movie and he's second banana to angst.Not that anyone is going to listen to me, but wait for cable or home video when you can zap through the dull parts.Four out of ten, simply because the 10 out of ten Molina bits are dragged down by less than zero rest of the film.",4,2,5,4 July 2004

He ends up falling in with an impetuous hot headed guy much to the disdain of his fianc√©.Amusing tale that's helped greatly by the likable cast which over comes a too restrained direction. For me the weakness of the film is the direction which seems to be a little too close to point and shoot style of direction. Where it gives a certain sense of reality it seems to work against the comedy since it just drains the some of the humor of the situations.I liked it I just kind of wish I had waited for cable and not paid 11 bucks a head to see this.,6,0,6,25 May 2009

Then again I'm not a fan of anything Producer Judd Apatow has put out from his own film Knocked Up, to the films he either wrote or produced Walk Hard, Talladega Nights, Fun With Dick and Jane, Anchorman, Kicking and Screaming.

No. There are the bumps and such where things don't move smoothly. There is also a sense that the film could have used some fleshing out, but for the most part its a damn fine action film. Its a comic book come to life not a Russian novel and it behaves like the cinematic equivalent of one.I know that one twist involving how Wolverine loses his memory has some fan boys having kittens, but you know what, there had to be a reason and thats as good as any especially owing to all that happens to the character.I had a blast. I can't wait for the home video version with extras.Worth a look with a bucket of popcorn and a soda.Its not the best comic movie but it is an entertaining one.(if you want more than that its only because you've been spoiled by Ironman, Hulk, Batman and Hellboy- It pales compared to them, but then again most things will.)",8,4,8,4 May 2009
Constantine," Good Occult Thriller
","For the record I have read Hellblazer, the source of this film, and I do like the comic.Also for the record I do like this movie a great deal as well.Is it the comic? Thats open to debate. I think in many ways it it is. I think the problem is that they've made a film about a very complex character who's been developed over hundreds of issues and distilled him down to what a mass audience could take in.(remember this is a character that runs in DC's alternative, non 'mainstream' Vertigo comic line) No, he's not English, its not set in London, and its not always night and raining, but other than that I think they have the feel. Keanu for my money is pretty good. I think the problem for most people who read the comic is he's not a snarky Brit and therefore its not Constantine. I think he's fine and his performance takes other bits of his personality and brings them to the forefront. Its no different than the way different writers have handled the character over the years.As a movie its a very good. Its not high art and its not Silence of the Lambs scary, but its a really good thriller with neat visuals and a creepy attitude. Any movie that can keep me up and awake until almost two in the morning when going in I could barely keep my eyes open, has to be a very good film.I must single several of the supporting cast, Tilda Swinton as Gabriel and Peter Stormare as Satan. Both give great performances, though Storemare's devil who desperately wants Constantine's soul is flesh crawling evil at its finest. Talk about evil incarnate.The plot has to do with the 're-discovery' of the Spear of Destiny, the attempt of the son of Satan to take over the world, and the investigation of the supposed suicide of an LA detectives twin sister. Its not giving anything away to say they are all related nor that there intertwining forms a pretty dark path.This is a really good movie thats worth seeing if you're into ghoulies and ghosties and things that bump in the night.",8,2,7,6 March 2005
Troy," Its not history or the legend, just damn good film making
","Your 'Loath to Love' quota for this film will depend on two important factors, first what do you think of Brad Pitt? If you hate him stay away. Second you have to throw out the idea that this is anything other than suggested by the historical/legendary event, if you can do that you're golden.Since I like Brad Pitt and am not bothered by historical accuracy, especially involving one we really know little about I fell in love with this movie. I think this is a grand spectacle of the sort they don't make any more- or didn't until computers made it easier to do so. This is dark brooding heroes and wondrous action. This is why I love movies, you go somewhere else for three hours and just let it wash over you.The only major flaw seems to be the fact that once the horse shows up it races to the end much much too fast.I can not argue the purists who want the story as told over the centuries, but allowing that they condense a ten year, very complicated story into just under three hours, its amazing. I will whole heartedly  say that the removal, or at least the questioning of the Gods role in things  makes it even more tragic since we are the ones who made the mistake and as such we have no one to blame but ourselves.The cast is across the board good to excellent, with Peter O'Toole a certainty for an Oscar nom, if not award next year. I also want to take back some of the terrible things I said about Eric Bana in the Hulk. At last he has a role that explains why he was given the role in that film (even if it doesn't explain why he was so flat there.) Here Bana is a wonderful Hector, a man who's love for his brother brings everything down around him. We feel for his pain.This is an excellent film, 9 out of 10, for a last twenty minutes in need of lengthening.",9,13,25,15 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Good but not great tragic love story
","This the story of two men who fall in love and can't come to terms with the relationship.I'm probably going to be in the minority, but I find this movie to be very over rated. Its not bad, but over produced and so incredibly pretty that this film struck me as being more of a lets pretend than a real life story. Its very artificial in way that makes me think that perhaps the producers and the director didn't truly trust the material to draw people in, so spiced it up. If you tell a story correctly the film will cross boundaries and move people regardless of the subject matter or sexual orientation. This movie never moved me. As I sat there and watched the film I kept wondering what this would have looked like had some one like John Huston or Sam Peckinpah would have done it as a small gritty western ala The Misfits. (Then again nobody would have probably noticed it) Sure to win a good number of Oscars this is not a bad movie, just a very over rated one.",6,9,37,5 February 2006
Orphan," Good thriller hurt by a pace that allows you to think about the plot holes
","A family that is still living in the shadow of the tragedy of a miscarriage decides to adopt an older child. They decided to adopt Ester, a girl who seems much more mature than the rest. However once she settles into house, it rapidly becomes clear that all is not right with the little girl. Well made horror film with a couple of problems that I think keep this film from being great. This is a film that has the look and feel of 'bad seed' sort of films down. It hits all the right buttons in just the right way so as to make the tension grow and the skin crawl. The film is a perfect sort of guilty pleasure film.As I said earlier the film has a couple of problems that kind of wound the film. First off the film is too long at just over two hours. More than a couple of times I looked at my watch and wondered how much longer this was going to go on. Its not that what I was seeing was bad, its just that it has a couple of sequences that seemed to go on past the point of optimum effect. The other problem for me is that the film has some plot holes that you can drive a truck through. I'm not talking about the infamous twist which has been a make or break for some people, I'm talking about other things, like no one really checking Ester's background until its way too late. There are a few others (including questions as a result of said twist) that kind of made me go 'wah?'. I suppose the suspension of belief is whats required for any film like this, but this one really pushes the limit and the audiences good graces.(Perhaps if the film had moved faster I wouldn't have had time to reflect and pull the film apart) Reservations aside this is a good little film. I don't think its the be all and end all but it is the sort of film thats perfect for curling up on the couch with on a rainy Saturday night.Between 6 and 7 out of 10 ----- Re the twist: It worked for me. I can see how it might not for other people, but at the same time its something that raises a hell of a lot more questions then it answers",6,1,4,3 August 2009
500 Days of Summer," The course of romance
","The story of a relation ship over the course of 500 days. Zooey Deschanel plays Summer, the object of Tom Hansen's eye (he's played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt). We watch the relationship out of order as we are told what day we are seeing. Off beat romantic comedy turns the notion of a romantic comedy on its head as well as the notion of what is romance anyway. Very well acted, Daschenel and Gordon-Levitt sell the films quirky construction enough that we accept the way the film is told.. I think this is the sort of film that we probably can all relate to, more so if we've had a relationship crash and burn and we've had to crawl from the wreckage. It is as, the advertising says, not a romantic film but a film about romance in all it joy (there's a musical number) and sorrow. recommended.",7,1,2,2 October 2009
Juno," 90 minutes with some good people
","Despite her wishes it wasn't so, Juno finds herself pregnant as the result of her one night stand with her best friend. At first she thinks she'll have an abortion, however she changes her mind and decides to put the baby up for adoption. As time passes she tries to deal with her family, her friends and the perspective parents for her baby.Smart, funny, touching film that is actually almost as good as some reviewers would have you believe. The excellent cast lead by Ellen Page as Juno is a perfect match for the material.(Page's Juno is one of the great women of the screen and possibly second to Nora Charles as the ideal woman for me) Everyone is pretty note perfect. (I could actually argue that this film as as close to perfect in construction as one is likely to get.) The film's dialog is filled with endlessly quotable one liners. I'm certain that this is going to be one of those movies that people end up memorizing for the great lines. My problems with the film relate to the 'wittiness' of the script. The dialog at times is almost too perfect and too polished, as many people have pointed out no one speaks that smartly that frequently. Others have pointed out that this is only a movie and not really real. I find myself on the fence, enjoying the lines, but at the same time bothered by the perfection of it all. I know its a movie but for a film that weaves such a potent spell of reality, the too good to be true nature does put cracks in the bubble. The smart lines do calm in the second half and they are less noticeable on a second viewing where the film can truly be seen for what it is and not what it seems to be or has been held out to be. For me, seeing the film a second time made the one liners just part of the film, though there seeming endlessness did slightly diminish things.Still despite it all, despite an improving on a second viewing I still don't LOVE the film. I like it a great deal. I don't know if its one of the best films of the year, but it is one of the friendliest.7.5 out of 10 (7 out of ten for IMDb purposes). Its 90 odd minutes with some good people.",7,4,12,21 January 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," Visual Aside, This Movie Stinks
","The story of a sudden change in the weather that brings an over night ice age is one of the dullest films in the past few years. If it weren't for the spectacular visuals this movie would sink to the 'never to be remembered' pile faster than the winds change in this story. Worse is the fact that many of FX shots seem to have been cribbed from many other, better, films.Emmerich is, at his heart, a B-movie director. If you look at the films he's made they have all been glorified b-movies. What made them work was great characters that you could care about. The trouble here the characters are all one note and even the great leads can't work miracles with a script that simply calls for one emotion from most of them. You quickly learn not to care and you quickly lapse into boredom.I will not even get into the science which is so much a joke that anyone with a brain can't suspend disbelief.(Give me The Core any day)Unless you really feel the need to pay 10 bucks to see this on the big screen (the visuals are at best a third of the running time) stay home and wait for video....or cable.",2,2,6,30 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Great ending to the series
","Let me start by saying that the biggest flaw of the film is that this film simply starts at point A and goes. This is not to say that the film shouldn't do that, no rather I'm arguing that the film needs a bit more of a bridge between this one and the last one. Sue me, for what ever reason I felt like I was reading a book and that some one ripped out two chapters in the middle and that while you can follow what was going on you'd be better off had you read what was missing.That said, I really loved this movie. Packed to the rafters with plots and ideas and action this is the film that the last film should have been. This is a solid 2 hours 45 minutes that never lets up-even as it confuses you. What can I say this film proves what a mistake the last one was and how you really shouldn't take a 90 minute movie and blow it up another hour. But enough complaining about the last film, lets talk about this one.A great thrill ride where characters shift and grow and things move along. I loved it. I loved much of the small stuff-The Bootstap Bill stuff, the broken hearted lovers, the romance and everything else. If there is any real flaw to the film its that the villains-the East India trading company don't really make sense are not menacing enough especially compared to Davy Jones and Captain Barbosa (also some of what they do makes no logical sense whats so ever). Caught on the ride I didn't care I just went with it all (though I still wish they weren't so whimpy.) Definitely worth a look see.",8,1,1,26 August 2007
Spider-Man 3," Some great action sequences are lost in a film who's script tries to do too much and be all things to all people
","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I'll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been",6,197,311,6 May 2007
Yes Man," Not bad, but not worth seeing this first run
","Jim Carrey is a cranky man who takes a self help course during which he promises self help guru Terrence Stamp that for one year he'll only say yes to anything thats asked of him. As a result Carrey begins to change and to live.Okay, almost great, this film falters because it can't quite get the right tone. Some of the film is serious some is not. The cast at times seems unsure of which tone they are suppose to strike. Its good enough that you wish it was better. Worth a look, but I don't know if it needs to be at ten bucks ahead.6 out of 10",6,6,11,19 January 2009
Resident Evil: Extinction," Forget the plot (the filmmakers did) this is worth seeing for the action and monster sequences
","Survivors of the virus that has ravaged the world, turning the dead into zombies and the world into a vast wasteland, have learned to keep moving least the zombies find them. Milla Jovovich returns as Alice, zombie killer number one.After some lone wanderings in the Desert she hooks up with a band of travelers and looks to stop the evil Umbrella corporation once and for all. Not as good as the last film but better than the first one. I don't think that the film's plot makes a whole heck of a lot of sense, which is fine since the numerous action set pieces are so tightly wound you can pretty much forgive the poor plotting. I mean the last time I checked people tended to watch these films for the blood, the gore and the monster killing. Upping the ante with some killer crows and some beast which shall remain nameless this film just moves like the wind with in each extended action sequence (Forget Hitchcock's birds these things are lethal). Each scene of violence left me exhausted and willing to deal with the non exposition of the main plot(okay its stupid I admit it). Worth a look for horror and action fans, though I'm not sure its really worth 10 bucks to see it.",6,6,7,14 October 2007
Zodiac," Very good but slightly disappointing story of the Zodiac killings
","David Fincher dives into the Zodiac killings in San Fransisco. Disorienting only in that this is more or less a straight telling of how three men's lives were changed by the killings. The cast is a cross the board excellent with Robert Downey Jr a stand out as the reporter who sinks into alcoholism as the elusive case gets away. Following Robert Greysmith's book on the story fairly closely this is a gripping tale that will annoy some people since, and its not rally giving anything away, there is no definitive ending. The killer isn't caught, though a suspect is named. For me the problem is tied together in the fact that we are asked to give up three hours of our lives to a story that has no, and will probably never have, final solution. While the lack of an ending makes you feel much like the characters on the screen it also annoys you and makes wanting to return to the film again not something you'd look forward to. Don't get me wrong, I really like the film a great deal (I've read a lot on the killings) I just wish they had managed to find a more satisfying way to end the film so I'd have a reason to go back to it sooner rather than later. Definitely worth a look, just prepared for a 'thats it' feeling even with the end text.",8,1,1,18 August 2007
Milk," Very Good
","Life and times of Harvey Milk.Very good representation of of the man and his causes. Sean Penn is wonderful as Milk the first openly gay supervisor in San Francisco. Josh Brolin is equally good as Dan White the man who would kill Milk and Mayor Moscone.The first hour is near perfect as we watch Milk become politicized and run for office. The second hour is very good but a bit messy as we watch Milk deal with an unstable lover, gain more power and clash not only with Senator Briggs who was violently anti-gay but also with Dan White another supervisor. Aside from having too much on its plate, the second hour suffers because White remains a large cypher despite having a good amount of screen time. Perhaps White's weirdness and distance was the way he was, but at the same time his character, despite Brolin's Oscar worthy performance is a black hole of sorts.Flaws included this is a really good movie. A stunning tribute to a man and his life. You will be touched and you will be moved. I was.You do want to see this movie.A strong number somewhere between 7 and 8.",8,2,8,27 December 2008
The Prestige," Wonderful story of magical rivalry is best seen knowing as little as possible
","The second magic related stories to be released in just over a month.Christopher Nolan has constructed an elaborate puzzle box of a movie thats a really good thriller. This is the story of two magicians who attempt to out do each other. The hatred is the result of a tragedy that happened years before on stage. Told in a series of flashbacks the film is a search for the secret of each man's version of the teleported man.Superbly acted, this is one of the rare recent films where the actors, even when big stars like Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine completely disappear into their roles. Its clear why everyone was involved with this film because everyone gets real meaty roles. David Bowie appears as Nikola Tesla and has the best role he's yet to appear in. You really must see this film for the actors if nothing else.You have noticed that I'm rather light on details and thats intentional. This is the sort of movie that is best taken on its face value. You'll want to see the twists and turns of its plot for yourself and not have them spoiled by reviewers and friends who feel the need to tell you too much about the story. What Nolan has constructed is a complex little thrill ride. What I will tell you is that he does play fair, in the end you will know all.For me this is going to require a second or third viewing. Its one of those movies where I'm in love with the construction of the film so much that I have to see it again to see if the thing is as good on an emotional level, I think it is but I'm still distracted by the 'sparklies' of the box.Go see this film if you like good twisty stories with more than a hint of real magic in them.",9,4,7,3 November 2006
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A beautifully realized romantic fantasy
","When the prince of elves decides that he and his kind have had enough of mankind and their encroaching upon their lands, he decides to get the pieces of the magic crown that will allow him to awaken the magical golden army. Fortunately for mankind Hellboy, Liz Abe and friends are standing on the front line.Grand fantasy of the highest order with more than just a touch of romance tossed in this is one of the best films of the year. Remember how uneven the first movie was with the character scenes playing better than the action scenes? Remember how good those scenes- like Hellboy on the roof were? Thats this whole movie- its all character driven- even in the action scenes. Its wonderful.This is a film that takes you somewhere else and makes you feel something. Its both heady and entertaining in a way that Wall-E isn't. I loved that for two hours I was somewhere else that was kind of like New York but isn't. I loved that this is a full realized world that all makes sense. I loved that you feel something. The romance in this film is magical. The emotion is so touching. I was crying on numerous occasions.This is a great film.Is it perfect? No. I could nitpick it apart but what would be the point? It is what it is. Its magical and marvelous and wonderful.And if you loved this film-or if you loved the legend John Hurt reads to the youthful Hellboy- you must see Strings. Strings is a magical film done with marionettes and is one of the most amazing fantasies I've ever seen (and I think its slowly becoming one of my favorite films). The opening legend has the feel of that film.9 out of 10 See it on the big screen if you can.",9,2,7,14 July 2008
Cloverfield," Great monster, the rest I'm not too sure about
","Supposed found footage of a civilian's eye view of a monster invasion of New York. Beginning at a party the action then shifts as something is seen and felt invading New York. When a desperate message is received from a friend trapped in her building several friends head off to rescue her...I'm of mixed emotions. Certainly when the film gets things right its gangbusters and some of the best film making of its type. When it doesn't work its downright tedious.What doesn't work for me (aside from a bent sense of New York) boils down to two things. First the twenty minute or so set up is way way way too long. Especially when you consider that the film sans end credits is about 70 minutes. the party sequence goes on and on and on and had I not been waiting for monsters I probably would have bailed. Hud, our cameraman, is a bit of an idiot and I hate that we are trapped with him for most of the film. The other problem for me is that the camera is constantly recording. Hud insists on recording everything at the party and then once things start to happen he constantly has the camera rolling. To be certain if he didn't we'd miss things but I doubt the batteries on the camera would last that long and I get real tired of him filming walking upstairs or down a street with nothing happening except him babbling. Events toward the end, that probably should have not been filmed because the camera would have been dropped, are also seen. (The hand held nature of the film is annoying but its the central conceit of the film so you have to go with it.) I could also go into the deus ex machina sequences (the electronics store looting) that are there simply to move the plot along, but I won't. I kept thinking that had they filmed this with out the conceit of the camera this would have been a better movie.I know that the POV allowed for a cheaper film, but at the same time I wanted to see more. I think perhaps I would have like how it was filmed better had I connected with someone in the film. I really didn't connect to anyone, I don't think we really saw anyone long enough to connect. It is at times like watching someone's wedding home video or home movie. You can see that these are real people but at the same time you're left wondering who are these people. I don't think we're ever really given enough to really care about anyone.What the film gets right is the panic of the attack. The beasties, completely unexplained, are terrifying because no one knows whats going on. The fact that the film takes place over six hours keeps up the tension of the unknown. the attacks themselves are also really well done because we see only just enough to scare us. The monster stuff is great and probably some of the best giant monster stuff put on film, certainly its better than the American Godzilla which shares a couple of locations. There is a tension that is created that is rare in movies of this sort and when the film is firing on all cylinders the film is very tense and scary. This is the bread and butter of the film, this is the reason the film exists and its very well done.How do I rate the film over all? I don't know. There is much to love and much to dislike. I know why it is and how it is. I just wish it was better. Is it worth seeing? yes at some point. I know I'll probably get the DVD and watch the monster stuff again. I doubt I will ever really watch the early party sequences. If pushed I'd say 6 out of 10. Some better parts than that some worse. Worth a bargain matin√©e, but too short (and too uneven) for a full priced admission.",6,6,11,21 January 2008
Hotel Rwanda," A great inspiring story weakened by bad casting
","This is the true and inspiring tale of one man who tried to do something when his country descended into madness and genocide. Don Cheadle is masterful as our hero and he was deserving of an Oscar and not just a nomination. Its is thanks to him and most of the rest of the cast that we have as good a movie as we do. The problem, for me, with Hotel Rwanda is the casting of Nick Nolte as a UN peace keeper. Every time that Nolte appears on screen I'm pulled out of the movie. No longer am I in Rwanda but on a Hollywood set and big name actors are trying to act. Its distracting and it almost ruins the movie since it takes several minutes after each of his appearances to calm down enough to once again get lost in the story. Nolte aside, this is a great movie and should be seen , not only because its a record of what transpired, but also because its a damn good movie.",7,1,4,7 August 2005
Once," sweet

Actually these are the most real people I've seen on film outside of a documentary. They are absolutely wonderful. Its a sweet delicate little film that show cases a good number of songs by The Swell Season the duo that are the stars of the film.The music is really good.If there is a flaw in the film its that the film, which I've read was made essentially as a long form music video to show off the music, is at times too much concentrated n the music. Yea I know sacrilege, but I wanted more scenes with the people. I just wanted to watch them interact not necessarily watch montages with music. Shoot me I know.That said I do like the film and its clear that the song that won the Oscar deserved it.See the film.",7,0,3,13 August 2008

Daniel's gives a performance that should have been noticed by the Oscars but wasn't. Its through Daniel's interaction with all the other characters that we come to understand what the war was about.Even if the odd facial hair makes you crazy, its a great film.

And while it may have worked with John Wayne and Hatari but hasn't worked since.The plot has the group going to get money pay Andy Garcia back before he sends people to kill them.Then the plot stops, or gets thrown in a blender and only half is used.Some is funny.

Crash," A movie that knows whats good for you and tells you repeatedly
","This isn't going to be a review as such, rather just my feelings towards this film. This will probably help no one, but I feel I have to say something so I can move on to other, better films.I can't deny that this movie is well made. It looks good, its well acted (even if Sandra Bullock is too much of a personality and stands out too much), and its one of the rare Hollywood movies out today that has a point of view. But for all the pluses I can't say I like the film or even admire it on anything other than a technical level. I don't like being preached to. I don't like how it feels so carefully constructed and artfully put together that it seems more like a sermon rather than a movie. Sure its premise, simply put, that racism affects us all, and that some can over come it is true, but by the end of the movie I was left feeling unmoved and asking the screen 'yes, and?' The film seems to be trying to take a high ground and say that it knows better than all of us. Somehow I don't think so.This movie made me feel the same way that a play called Spinning into Butter made me feel. Spinning into Butter is by Rebecca Gilman and is in the process of being made into a movie. The play deals with racism on a small New England college campus. The center piece of the play is what is essentially a 20 minute monologue that boils racism down so narrowly that it ends up says that if you don't sit next to a person of a different race on a train/subway car, even if its completely empty except for the two of you then you are a racist. Many in the audience were moved by this. And equal number of the audience were left shaking our heads in disbelief since the play essentially says all acts are racial acts. I left the play, as I left the theater showing this movie admiring that they got so much right, but feeling that at the point at which they got on the soap box they lost me and I was never able to fully accept their premise.As well made and on target as the film is, its derailed by the film makers need to climb onto that soap box. I'm left not wanting to ponder the points out for myself, rather I want desperately to ask them 'yes, and your point was what?'.

","The story of a superstar singer who falls in love with her bodyguard could have been a major disaster. I remember the previews and thinking it was going to be one. However once the film was out and I actually watched it I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is a really good romance and a really good thriller. Of course its hokey and Hollywood and all of that but you get sucked in and carried along for its running time.Trust me this is better than you think it is.The only problem is that the film is a bit too long to do what it has to do. I think the problem is in the early part of the film where all of th e pieces are being set in motion, however once its all going its great.Get some popcorn your honey and enjoy.",8,97,120,12 February 2005
The Expendables," Lots of fun but its more like Cannonball Run with explosions then a fully satisfying film
","Sylvester Stallone brings together a whole slew of present and former action stars in the story of a group of mercenaries who are hired to free a small South American island from the control of the evil Eric Roberts. Actually it's something like that since the plot's mechanics come and go with an ease that is to be admired. Actually its not so much the plot that is the reason for being, it's the wise cracks and the action. The wise cracks mostly work and the action is big, loud and bloody. Lots of bullets are fired, most of Western civilization is blown up and CGI bodies are destroyed. Its definitely not Driving Miss Daisy. It's sadly also not a particularly good film. Yea it fun, but I really didn't need to pay 11 bucks to see this. It's kind of like a version of Cannonball Run with explosives, with its huge slate of stars matching up with the cast of the early 1980's Burt Reynolds film. If you see it you'll like it but you won't particularly like yourself for doing so since it tickles the basest parts of our nature.",5,2,8,7 September 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Good but...disappointing
","Guillermo del Toro's fairytale for adults.Yea.How do I write about this film? (I think you should prepare yourselves for a 'but...') Across the board this is a masterful motion picture. The acting, the writing, the craft are all super but I didn't completely connect with it, certainly I'm left puzzled by the ending.More horrors of war story with fairytale elements added in this is the story of Ofelia, a young girl who goes with her pregnant and very sick mother to join her new step father. The stepfather is a Captain Vidal who is stationed in the Spanish country side looking for rebels.Vidal wants his wife near so that his son will be born near his father. The story follows as Ofelia 'escapes' into the labyrinth and the fairy tale world, it also follows Vidal's attempts to ruthlessly put down the rebels. (Its probably a 75/25 split) To be honest I'm going to have to watch this again. No I don't think watching this at 4am had anything to do with my almost ambivalent disappointment with the film. Its good, it follows the classic fairytale forms but I'm not sure what del Toro was getting at. I can see why people love the film but at the same time it eluded me. (I also could see the wheels of its construction in motion). I think on some level I'm puzzled that del Toro didn't make things seem less moved by the directors hand. I will not discuss what happens simply because it would require more spoilers than are allowed by law.Don't get me wrong its a good movie, not a great one, though I reserve the right to change my mind on a second viewing.Graphically violent (an early scene has a man's face smashed in with a bottle) this is pure undiluted Grimm Brother territory. Everything is dark and bleak. The villain of the piece, the wicked Stepfather, is one of the vilest characters to ever cross the screen. He's the sort of person who would put red hot shoes on the wicked queen in snow white and make her dance herself to death (and del Toro is the guy who'd show it.). Its not make believe violence.so be warned.",7,2,5,16 September 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Good screen adaptation of the now classic Broadway musical
","Returning from a long time at sea Sweeney Todd returns to London looking for the family that was taken from him. When he finds his wife dead and daughter the ward of the Judge that framed him he plots revenge with the aid of Mrs Lovett, his landlady and the owner of a shop that sells meat pies.Tim Burton's adaption of the Stephen Sondheim Musical is a ghoulish tour de force. This is a largely sung story that has been given the grand treatment by Burton and his crew. Coming on the heels of a very stripped down version that recently played Broadway where the actors played all the instruments and the whole story seemed to be being performed by inmates in a single room asylum, this is a big huge production where we are in all of the streets and back alleys of London. This is a throw back in size and scale to the musicals of old. The wide scale opening up of the play works wonders so that when we close in to Sweeney's and Mrs Lovett's small rooms we feel how trapped they are by circumstance and poverty. As a technical achievement the film is a masterpiece and one of the best things that Tim Burton has put together.The cast is a mixed bag. Everyone is good but some people are better than others, with Helena Bonham Carter probably the weakest vocally as Mrs Lovett. Her physical performance is quite good, but vocally she can be quite shrill.Johnnie Depp is wonderful as Todd, but its clear that as good an actor and singer he is he couldn't do this on stage (I know one should not compare stage and screen but with this show its hard not to). The one person who amazed me was Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli a rival to Todd. He is pretty much note perfect in his performance.If I have any real qualms with the film its the source material. I am not a Sondheim fan. I do like this musical, owing no doubt to ts ghoulish nature, but I've never loved. There are simply things in the show that didn't work for me on stage so didn't work for me here either. Even though I'm not fully enraptured of the films source, the film is certainly worth seeing, Though be warned the film is VERY bloody. The reason the film is rated R is because of the blood that is spilled.7 out of 10 for me and my reservations 8 out of 10 for everyone else",7,1,2,6 January 2008
Blades of Glory," You've seen it before
",Will Ferrell and Jon Heder as competing skaters forced to become a team after they are thrown out of singles skating.Okay comedy more or less follows a certain course once its set in motion. I wish Will Ferrel could get a character instead of a caricature. I'm not a fan of him and his shtick. As with Talladega nights his insistence at being over the top sends this to the bottom. I admire that he has a career but I also have to say that at some point he's got to stop doing the same thing in movie after movie. Jon Heder is okay but had it not been for Napoleon Dynamite I doubt he's have ever had a career.Funny to a point but haven't we seen this all before?,5,1,2,8 January 2008
Nacho Libre," Sweet story of a friar finding himself in wrestling is much different then the trailers made it out to be
","This is the story of Jack Black's friar who is trying to find his place in the world and in the monastery. Loving wrestling, but forbidden to do so, he begins life as a masked wrestler in order to get money for food for the orphans in his charge. Spurred on further by the appearance of a new nun, Black continues to wrestle in order to prove to himself and the others that he is somebody.This is a sweet amusing character study that has a few laugh out loud moments, but not a constant stream of jokes. Clearly this hurt the film at the box office where it did well, but not as well as some had hoped. Personally I really liked the movie, much more than I thought I would. Initially I stayed away from the film because I didn't like Napoleon Dynamite, the directors previous film, and because I didn't know what to make from the trailers. I was shocked when I finally got to see it because this is a sweet (in a good way) story of an outsider trying to find a place in the world and with in himself where he belongs.This is a gem. If you want a silly feel good movie this is the perfect tonic. Definitely worth a bag of popcorn and a glass of soda.",8,2,4,23 September 2006
Closer," Well made but misguided version of the play
","A few years back I saw the play of Closer on stage and while I wasn't truly in love with it, it had stayed with me during all of the intervening time. There's been talk of turning it into a movie since before the Broadway run, and finally with Mike Nichols at the helm it arrives on movie screens.How is it? A well acted, well written mess that suffers for the changing. Bouncing through time the story tells of the coupling, uncoupling, re-coupling and uncoupling of four people who try as they might not to abuse the hell out of each other.What worked on stage doesn't here. Conversations that took place in one place over a brief period of time are opened up and seem to stretch through various locations and so seem to be artificial, or having been staged by a director who was afraid to make a talking head picture.Natalie Portman's character seems to have been reinvented and for the most is not the disaster I had feared. I do question her constant smoking since it seems to have been put front and center as a means of making her seem older (or closer to her actual 20 something age) than the 15 years of her looks.There are several changes to the source material, in particular at the end where the fate of one character is completely different, and the stunning ending of the play is muted.I know I should not be comparing the play to the movie since they are ultimately different, but the only way to express why the film didn't work for me is to compare the two. I had given up any real hope that the film was going to be the play early and so took the film on its own terms and found it wanting. It just doesn't work on its own terms except fleetingly.The performances are first rate and as a series of unconnected scenes this is dynamite, but nothing hangs together. Its as if Mike Nichols had several very fine pieces of cloth but couldn't bring them together as anything that looked like the quilt he had in mind.See it or don't, I don't know what else to say since its such an almost film it may click with you or it may grate on you, the choice is yours.",6,10,18,12 December 2004
Capote," It maybe Capote's story, but you'll want to know more about the people around him
","Truman Capote goes to Kansas to investigate a murder and becomes involved in the story. His involvement leads to the writing of In Cold Blood which changed the face of fiction.A beautiful movie. This is a movie that doesn't have any shot that wouldn't look lovely on the wall of a museum. Beautiful shots of the country side that perfectly give a sense of place and are so perfect as to make you think its all unreal.The performances are perfect, with Philip Seymour Hoffman all but disappearing in to the role of the Capote (which is something the rest of the cast does as well). It was right to give him an Oscar.As good as the film is, and it is quite good, I turned off the DVD feeling just a bit empty. While the film is certainly Capote's story I wanted to know more about the people around him. I wanted a bigger sense of the communities, both in Kansas and in New York, that this force of literary nature wandered through. The film left me wanting more, not in the way that I wanted to see the story continue, rather more of the story at hand. This is in its way almost too big a story to be told in less than two hours. I think the problem is that the actors have etched such perfect portraits of the people around Capote that you want to get to know them too.Absolutely worth seeing.",7,2,4,3 December 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," A nice distraction
","Follow up to the two earlier films (yes there are references to both) is better and more together than the second film but not as good as the first. Its more of the same with a plot (getting revenge on Pacino for screwing over Elliot Gould) thats a movie and not an excuse to party off screen.A bit too leisurely for my tastes (plot threads meander too much before paying off nicely), its still a nice distraction. I liked it a great deal though I will say I was ambivalent until the end, which while not a great pay off was really good.If you want to see it either do so on the big screen or wait for the widescreen DVD since this was shot in a glorious widescreen that will lose a great deal on full screen TV See it, it will distract you for 2 hours-you may not (probably won't) love it but you will like it a great deal.",7,0,1,26 August 2007
We Are Marshall," Under rated movie that will make you feel good about the ability to come back from tragedy
","This one blindsided me. With some of the worst reviews of the Christmas season I thought that this was going to be time wasted, instead I found one of the more enjoyable movies I've seen in along while. The first half hour of this film is a great capsule of the events leading to and aftermath of the plane crash that wiped out the 1970 Marshall football team. At that point the film shifts gears as Matthew McConaughey is brought in to rebuild the team and be its coach. A feel good movie thats more about rebuilding the cracked soul of a community than football (though football is front and center) this is a movie that works because of the characters, we care about them so we care about the story. Its also got a great pop score. Though far from perfect, and probably not 'great', its a better than really good movie that the critics completely missed the boat on.",8,5,5,31 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Force is Still Not With It
","The continuation of the star Wars saga proves dramatically (plot wise) better than the previous film, but is even more wooden and stiff than before. George Lucas simply can not direct, he never could and never will be able to turn out anything other than an okay film. Fortunately for him, that one okay film, Star Wars, has been paying his bill for years.Lucas seems to think that bigger is better on every level so he cranks things up an extra fifteen notches thanks to the leap frog jumps in digital technology. Lucas has now built his entire movie against a blue screen which he fills with many wonderful sights. The locations and the designs are indeed wonderful, the problem is that in a year that brought Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, Lucas' special effects are far from special since its the one film of the three where you know instantly where the real people end and their animated versions begin. The animation in this film is some of the worst computer variety ever put into a film with a budget this big. The failure of the visual effects keeps pulling you out of the story especially when its so badly acted by everyone on screen with the exception of Christopher Lee, Samuel Jackson and Yoda.Star Wars as a franchise effectively died with the previous film and despite the occasional flash of life in this one its best to pull a sheet over its head and mourn the loss of a cultural icon.",3,2,5,6 March 2004
Gone Baby Gone," Be Affleck crafts one the years best films, or would have been except its source material breaks apart in the final stretch to the end
","Ben Affleck marches toward an eventual Best Director Oscar, maybe not this year, but mark my words he will be getting one if he repeats his stellar work on Gone Baby Gone.This is the story of a private detective and his partner who are asked by the family of a missing girl to help the police. The family knows that some people won't talk to cops so they hire Casey Affleck to augment the investigation. It quickly transpires that the loving mother was far from saintly and that there are other problems in the investigation.Brilliantly acted and monstrously wonderful on a technical end this film hopefully will get a boat load of Oscar nominations for all concerned at years end. Casey Affleck, Ed Harris and pretty much everyone else are at the top of the game and reason enough to watch the film. Director Ben Affleck has created a film that is a masterpiece mood and emotion. We are in Boston and these are real people. Affleck has managed to take any notion of this being unreal and a story being performed by actors and removed it from our minds. Thats a huge order when faced with titans like Harris and Morgan Freeman. Its a stellar achievement. I can't say enough, actually all I can say is that he's made something real and tangible, which is the highest praise I know.The problem with the film is the source material. Based on a book by the Author of Mystic River (another movie/story with plot holes you could drive a truck through) the film suffers from a complete break down of logic and reason in the last half. What is going on, really is so potboiler-ish as to be absurd. I kept wondering if I was missing something, and then realized I wasn't. I know that the twist and turns allow for the exploration of moral question and issues, but at the same time they are unbelievable in any real world sense. The problems are such that it keeps a good film from being what it should have been, one of the best of the year.Still the technical virtuosity of Ben Affleck and his cast make this a film that you really should see. Acting and directing don't get better than this.",7,2,7,23 December 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne continues to run as those that created him try to kill him in a film thats pure action and almost no plot
","Third in the series this film is pure motion from beginning to end. The plot is the same as the first two, Bourne looks for his past while the people who know it try to kill him. Not very original. Like the recent Harry Potter film the narrative is as bare bones as you can get, only more so since we really don't learn anything until the final moments, otherwise its pure action as Bourne goes from Moscow to London to Madrid to Morocco to New York. Give them points for making it just compelling enough to keep you following along for two hours, but take a few away from the lack of anything meaningful happening. Yes, the set pieces are fantastic but there really isn't anything to hold them together other than an idea, which is not really a plot. What is it about this series, they've done the opposite of most movie series in that as its gone on they've made them less and less complicated and removed the narrative almost altogether. (The next film will be Bourne running for two hours and we watch as he randomly assaults passers by.) I enjoyed it but was getting hungry for a real meal about half way in. (Hell Crank, which is a one note film has more flavor than this). Worth a look for action junkies and those with no need for anything more than motion on the screen to be happy (Basically its the adult version of the Teletubbies) Six out of ten",6,3,6,18 August 2007

","So what are we to make of the highly touted bio of Howard Hughes.Certainly this is one of the most lavish and spectacular films of the last few years. It looks great is fantastically put together and acted, but somehow something seems missing.As the film unspooled I was never bored but I didn't really care. I didn't really connect with the film. Yes, the film is dramatic but its never involving. I never felt that there was a reason to be watching other than it was a well made film that was somewhat interesting.I'm sure that had it not been a big award winning film that I would have liked it more, but for a film thats up for and won tons of awards I'm left puzzled, a feeling I have about every other Oscar Best Picture nominated film.See the film, its not bad, and do so on the big screen if possible.

Burn After Reading," It didn't work for me
","Wacky Coen Brothers film that should on the page work, but in actuality falls flat. The story is about John Malkovich a disgruntled CIA agent who quit in order to write his memoirs. The disc is lost and it becomes a scramble between a bunch of twits in order to get their hands on the information contained with in. Well acted, well written the film falls flat because however the Coens put the film together it drains the humor out of the situations. I mean there were things that made me laugh in the trailer that just sort of washed over me with out a ripple in the film. I have no idea what happened. Its good after a fashion and better than the things like The Lady Killers, but its still not say Lebowski or one of their lesser films.",5,24,44,6 January 2009
The Last Legion," Fast moving action film is good but really could have used more time to flesh out some of the plot points
","Re-imagining of the Arthurian legends via ancient Rome.The plot of the film has a young boy crowned emperor in literally the waning days of the Roman empire. When the Goths invade he is captured by them and thrown into prison. Rescued he and his few remaining men go to Britain to find the last legion. (And I forgot the bit about Cesar's lost sword) Based on part of a novel by Valerio Manfredi this film suffers from compression. There is simply no way that the amount of plot in this film can be held in 100 minutes. Its not possible. Well actually it is possible since thats the case on screen. This epic tale screams to be at least an hour to an hour and a half longer (miniseries anyone?). The removal of any number of plot details leaves little time for anything but action, action and more action. The action is quite good but the investment in the story is lessened since all we have are the characters heroic efforts to build character and plot points. For example the villain in Ben Kingsley's past is given way too little screen time to really be much of anything.Over all I really liked the film. Its a perfect rainy day movie. Granted I didn't pay 11 bucks to see this in theaters rather seeing an import DVD so I was saved from over paying for it. To be certain some of the sequences seem to have been filmed with TV in mind, still the sets are opulent and the cast, especially Ben Kingsley are dynamite. As I complained rather loudly above the flaw of the film is that its much too short to do all the things it wants to do. If you can forgive that and enjoy the look of the movie and the action you'll have a good time. Just remember to make lots of popcorn.",7,0,3,11 September 2007
Watchmen," Good not great film is too faithful to be truly wonderful on its own terms
","n an alternate 1985, when Richard Nixon is working on his fifth term, someone throws former superhero The Comedian out of his high rise window. One of his former allies, a masked crusader name Rorschach smells a rat and he begins to contact his old cronies because he fears that some one is going after former superheroes. What Rorschach doesn't know is that what is going on is way beyond simple murder.Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's classic comic story has finally come to the screen. This is a story, which along with Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns changed not only comics but culture (all culture) forever. I remember reading the graphic novel version of the comic when it came out and being so floored that I went around giving people copies of the novel. The film is that its good but not great. It is too faithful and too artificial to truly be great. There are the seeds of a great film here and when they eventually remake it there will be a great film version.Zach Snyder is a transcriber here. He is far from the visionary director that the ads and some reviews have described. What he's done is essentially take Dave Gibbon's panels and put them on the screen. There is very little original to what he's put on the screen. Much of the dialog seems to be Moore's as well. On some level its almost as if he ripped the pages from the novel and put them on the screen. Yes Snyder and his collaborators have made cuts and changes, but for the most part what you see is the novel. The problem is that Snyder in being faithful to the comic has forgotten that with a comic the mind will connect the panels and that the mind will add life to material between 'the lines'. Snyder in being faithful to the material never added the life to his tableaux.There is no life past the edges of the screen. I never really became engaged until about half way in when the power of Patrick Wilson's acting lifted the film despite the other short comings. Wilson brought a life to the proceedings that transcended the rest of the film.(This isn't to sell the rest of the cast short. Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Matt Frewer, and Stephen McHattie are Wilson's equals) Snyder's faithfulness to the book has also caused another problem, it shows the limitations of the source novel. This is not to sell the novel short only to point out what works on the page doesn't work on the screen.(I want to raise questions about plot points not being all that great but I'm not sure if the problem is Moore's or Snyder's so I'm going to reserve picking the plot apart until I see the directors cut and reread the novel- though I will say that some of the Mars material is silly)Snyder is also too faithful in his shot choices. We don't need all of the shots that are exactly the same as the comic. Set up the situation, and let it play out in real space with out the need to match the comic panels. And while I'm bitching about being too close, we don't need the whole sex scene between Night Owl and Silk Spectre, nor do we need to see ever broken bone, every whack in the head with a meat clever. Less is more. We know the pair is having sex, we don't need a Leonard Cohen video. And didn't Snyder ever realize that when you want to have violence continue to have an effect you show the results once and then you have the audiences attention, since after the third time it becomes silly. I know it seems like I'm taking the film apart, and I am. I can't help not doing it because this film should have been better, this should have been so much better. I mean the moment when Patrick Wilson suits up for the first time in a long time was magical. but little else is. I blame director Snyder who either just is copying some one else's material or is falling back on tricks- say Slow Motion. to cover his limitations. I think if Snyder had used this script and this cast and had dared to be different in something other than the ending I think he would have made a great film. Lets face it the reason the novel is so popular is that its a great story and when thats allowed to shine, mostly in the second half the film is really good.I shouldn't be able to pull as much of this film apart as I am. I should have been more engaged and not thinking about what didn't work.Its a good film but its not a great one.And I know you probably want to know what about the ending. How is the end of the film as compared to the novel. I think its okay, it works. I don't know that its works as well as the original but it works. (I should point out that I don't think the film as a bleak and dark as many people have said. I don't see the heroes in the film as any darker than any other hero in comics. They are heroes and anti heroes, and the only difference is that the damage they cause is 'real'. What did people think would have happened when Batman kicked the snot out of someone? The joke always was that Batman could beat someone into a coma but wouldn't cross the line to killing some one...here...things are less clear.)",6,4,12,7 March 2009
Hot Rod," Amusing tale could have been great shorter or with a more daring director
","Rod fancies himself a stunt man in the Evel Knievel mode. He also has a stepfather who doesn't really respect him because he doesn't fight (the step-dad) well. When the stepfather needs a heart operation Rod comes up with plan to raise the money so that he can get him well and then beat him up.Amusing film from an SNL alum that either needed to be about an hour long or directed by a more daring director willing to make it something more original. Its an amusing movie that has couple of big laughs, several smaller ones, and a charm that some how keeps it a float. Ian McShane as the stepfather is a hoot and the rest of the cast is pleasant. The problem with the film is simply that it never reaches very far past the premise nor does it strive to be anything more than run of the mill. This is a film that has a plot you can pretty much guess once its set in motion and characters, that while amusing, were all taken off the busiest shelf in the clich√© store. That would be fine for a movie we see on cable, but you're asking us to plunk down ten bucks to sit in a theater and watch something that, while amusing isn't original enough to be worth the cash outlay. Don't get me wrong I liked the movie and it made me laugh but had I paid big bucks to take my family to see this I'd be very angry.Worth a look on cable or as a rental (it will amuse you), just don't pay ten bucks a head for this.",6,2,5,14 October 2007

However it soon becomes clear that no one knows what the course is...Continuation of 28 days later is a visceral assault on the senses. I have no idea if it makes sense as such but as an ass kicking film its very good. The opening 15 minutes is easily some of the scariest stuff ever put on film. No you don't have to have seen the first film, this one explains just enough to get you going.Simply put this is one of the rare sequels that bests the first film.

Don't get me wrong its an exciting tale expertly if overly slickly told, but I never really bought it.

The Hills Have Eyes," Okay remake. Given the choice, see the original for real fright.
","This remake of the Wes Craven classic is nowhere near as good. Certainly it has some great moments and visual images and the idea of a 'modern' family having to fight off a family of savages is a frightening one, but some where along the way it lost its teeth. Certainly the fact that the studio asked that some of the more subversive touches of the original (baby for dinner anyone?) be trimmed doesn't help. It also doesn't help that this film has inspired countless remakes an homages over the last 30 years. Worse, I don't know how many retreads I saw in the last year. Why remake a film if you're going to de-claw it and then take the same path as every other film maker. Its pointless. Worse its about 20 minutes longer than the original film and as a result this film tends to stagger about for a good while before it seems to get its focus. Its not bad, but the remake is better and more out there. Given the choice, see the original.",5,7,11,2 April 2006

I didn't.This is the sad tale of two people who barely know each other torn apart by war and who wait expectantly for the moment they come back together.The war scenes are spectacular and the film is wonderful to look at but, but for me this movie is so over wrought that I can't accept it as anything but a bad Gone with the Wind wannabe.

North by Northwest," Good but not quite one of the greatest films of all time
","Considered one of the best of Hitchcock's films I find that I'm not that big a fan of the film. Its not that it's a bad movie, rather I think that the film has been ripped off and re-staged so many times that any power the film might have had is rather dissipated. Its kind of like watching Citizen Kane or some other film that is said to have changed the way movies are done and finding that they don't play all that well. The reason is, like North by Northwest that they changed the rules and have been so copied it hard to see what was so revolutionary about them. As it stands now the story of Cary Grant being mistaken for someone else and having to flee from both the police and the bad guys is exciting, especially in its set pieces, but the rest of it isn't anything special and has the feel of been there and done that especially when compared with Hitchcock's other films.

","(This film is difficult to write about with out going into details, and this is the best I could do) Dark film from Alex Proyas about what happens when a time capsule is opened and its found that a sheet of numbers contained inside it seems to correspond to great disasters. As the story unfolds there are three sets of numbers left in the series which begins to worry single dad Nick Cage, an astrophysicist who seems to think that all of life is random and that 'stuff happens'.( I'm not going to really say more since the less you know about the film the better I think its going to play)Much reviled (critics) and much loved (movie going public) film is an eerie debate about whether all life is a random occurrence or whether there is a dark order in the machine. I loved the first three quarters of this film which is structured as a dark decent into something potentially horrible. The film doesn't tell you a great deal, indeed we only know as much as Nick Cage does so our minds, like that of out hero, is allowed to wander and draw our own conclusions (indeed even when the film ends we still down know a great deal so the film is going to end up endlessly debated). I think the film works , even with the occasional over acting by cage because the notions of the film that there may be something to the numbers is so well handled that you can't help but feel the tension ,it also helps that the two central set pieces of a plane crash and subway accident are profoundly disturbing in their execution. (Trust me they may look one way in the commercials, but seeing them in the context of the film is truly frightening.)I don't love the movie as a whole, but there is a point about 90 minutes in when the film hits a bump as it has to angle towards the ending and has to clear up, at least some (but far from all) of the mysteries. Its not that I mind the ending or what happens, its just that there is this sudden turn in direction- a direction that sends us to the end when the dues ex machine is fired up and brought into play and the film is fired through it. What was a well oiled and well plotted film is suddenly rushed and hurried. I was watching things with a 'What is all of this about'? or 'Where did this come from' attitude.It knocks the film down from a great film to a merely very good one in my eyes.I like the movie a great deal. I like that the film doesn't supply all of the answers, or even most of the answers. I want to say more, but I completely understand why Roger Ebert reviewed the film and then went back and discussed the film in two further posts where he went into details.My advice is give the film a shot.",7,2,5,31 March 2009
The Orphanage," Scary and creepy story over comes a couple lapses of internal logic to be a winning film
","Guillermo del Torro presents The Orphanage. he had nothing really to do with the film, but its appropriate considering that many have tagged this as a sibling to his Pan's Labyrinth (which I think for plot points rather than it being an updated fairy tale- I don't see Peter Pan as a fairy tale) The story has Laura, her son and husband returning to the orphanage where she grew up in order to turn it into a home for special needs kids. Her son has two invisible friends, a number that increases once they move in. It rapidly unfolds that they are not alone in the house and that strange things are going on.There is much more to the story, which pretty much everyone has been closed mouth about so I will do the same as well. Actually I won't do it out of deference to the lack of discussion, rather because this is a film that is best discovered on its own. The plot turns, which often resemble other films, do propel the film in its own way.(Its like comparing cars they all have similar things but that doesn't mean they are the same car). At times the film is rather deliberately constructed, hitting certain plot points as if on a check list (at least for Spanish or Euro-horror), however there are other times when the film bends what you think is going to happen into something else (the medium's walk through the house is chilling). Actually the film gets better as it goes on with a moment about half way into the film when you suddenly realize that the film has really cranked you up.I really liked the film a great deal. Its so nice to have many people tell me I need to see a movie and then have it turn around and have them be right. Friends and reviewers were right to say that this is a solid little horror film. Its nice to have a film hold you and keep you interested from start to finish. Its even nicer to have a horror film crank up the tension is such away that you never saw it coming, and then keep it tight until the very end.If there are any real problems with the film its that there are a couple of times when the film struggles to have you believe its own internal logic. A couple of things happened that made me wonder why no one noticed them before, or if people (husband) behaved a certain way to keep the plot moving. The film wins out in the end but its the difference between a mostly satisfying film and a completely satisfying film.Highly recommended. about 8 out of 10.",8,3,6,18 October 2008
"I, Robot"," And I screamed at the screen in frustration....
","...and continued to scream in this review....This is a good movie that should have been better. This is actually a great film that was tinkered with to the point of becoming middling.This film, inspired rather than based on Asimov's book, is a film of ideas that is corrupted by the need to be a big Hollywood movie. Time and time again this film lingers on the spectacle when it hits every small moment.What were they thinking?No, this is not vintage Will Smith, and yes the female lead is pretty bad, but the film still works. Despite a completely unreal world this film still works. Despite the fact that the film was wounded by Smith battling Proyas for the shape of the film, it still works whenever the small personal moment, or the moments of ideas, for example Smith's first meeting with James Cromwell floored me in its simplicity and perfection... and left me to wonder what this film might have been.See this on TV where I'm certain the small moments will play better than on the big screen. Then again it will leave you sobbing for what might have been.6 out of 10",6,0,2,28 July 2004
The Alamo," This Just Misses
","Infuriating best describes this new version of the story of the Alamo. Everything is there except for a script to hold it all together.The story of the Alamo has been told several times on screen and for the most part they have all been pretty good little trips into our nations mythology. In the current incarnation the story is concerned with much more than the battle itself, it stretches from a year before the battle through to the end of the Texan War for Independence.  For one of the few times we get what the battle meant in context of the fight for freedom. The problem is that in trying to cover so much the movie plays like a History Channel special come to life, there are too many characters and too many events to fill a two hour movie. You want to care more than you do, but you can't since most of the characters remain largely cyphers. Only Billy Bob Thornton becomes his character, and does so in a performance worthy of Oscar consideration.As good as some pieces of this is I have to give it a 6 out of ten simply because it doesn't connect the way it should.",6,1,5,18 April 2004
Wanted," lack of a script , a believable world and characters makes this a series of emotionally empty great looking cgi filled action scenes with nothing to connect them
","(THIS COMMENT HAS SPOILERS) Timur Bekmambetov, who scored with the Night Watch films comes to America (again-the first time he was working for Roger Corman) and makes a visually arresting but other wise incredibly stupid action film. The plot of the film has Wesley Gibson (James Mc Avoy), an account manager who is as put upon as they come, recruited by a band of assassins in order to be trained to kill the man who killed his father,, one of the men who had leading the assassins. There are some twists and turns but mostly its an excuse for some really good looking set pieces, that are worth the effort to see them on TV when this finally hits cable. As for the twists and turns, there are maybe two' and they are so late in the game as to be purely an excuse to keep the movie going until its reached the two hour mark.This is a a seventy minute film stretched to two hours for no good reason. The simplistic retelling of the plot is how simple the film is. It actually removes any clich√©d notions of films with similar plots by excising any notions of exposition. It does this because the script doesn't really provide any sort of story or real characters. Part of the problem is that the film has a series of set pieces that take away from any notion of character development, there is no time when you have to get to the next fight or training scene. So no one,not even McAvoy arc, they just are. Sure McAvoy's character changes but its as if someone flipped a switch not grows overtime. Whats worse is the fact that the world the characters live in isn't real, not even remotely. Only the characters can do super things and they do so in away that isn't believable, we really don't know why or how other than 'training'. It makes no sense.(actually they cut out that this is based on super villains vs superhero story)Actually nothing makes sense even its own twisted film world. In the Night Watch films there are similar stunts and action, but a world is created where all of the weirdness could happen. Here there is nothing, these people exist (and haven't been found out despite doing fantastical things, and we have to take it on faith) and we have to accept that and everything else the film tells us. You see its not just in the action scenes, whole concepts in the film just ring as false because there is no reason for it. The Loom for example. Worst of all is the healing bath. Shades of Ra's Al Ghul's Lazarus bath, which is used so that McAvoy can get the stuffing kicked out of him over and over again. Its a cheat of the worst sort. The film makers have asked us to believe way too much. I can suspend disbelief up to a point but you can't give me 12 things to believe and not give me any means of support.To be certain the action scenes are great. To be honest they are pure CGI but they still are incredible pieces of visual ballet. The problem is that because the story is lacking I can only admire the visuals I can't love them because there is no reason to take them as anything other then as set pieces unconnected to anything.On some level the motion and pretty pictures entertained me, but at the same time I felt I wasted a couple hours of my life. Honestly I haven't felt this bad in a long time, even with all the trash grade z movies I watch.This was two hours I will never get back. What makes it really painful is the action works, the acting is there, but the script was clearly stuck in the word processor.Wait for cable.",3,64,117,28 June 2008
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," So good I completely forgot I saw it
",Note to self: Please try to remember when you saw Madagascar 2 since you actually did laugh at it and find the humor in it quite good even if the plot kind of falls flat.The plot has the group getting off Madagascar thanks to a plane rigged up by the penguins. Unfortunately they run out of fuel over Africa where they crash some where on the veldt near where Ben Stiller was born. From there the plot cranks out in unremarkable ways while providing some really good laughs thanks to well crafted jokes.Honestly I can't say more than that because I've apparently erased the film from my memory. It was only thanks to seeing a poster for an IMAX screening that brought it back. Clearly its going on my list of most memorable films of all time.,5,1,6,6 January 2009
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," The music is great, the rest less so
","Spoof of every music biography you can think of with John C Reilly in the lead a Dewey Cox, a Johnny Cash style singer. Amusing, but only to a point, this is movie that sets up a joke and unleashes it then sets up another joke and unleashes it and then another and another one at a time in succession as it hits every movie music bio clich√© there is. As game as the cast is I could find no reason to keep watching this film, except that the songs are excellent. Frankly if it wasn't for the songs I'd say pass on this film until cable since the jokes are too few and often too obvious to bother with besides buying the cd of music would be cheaper and jump you right to the good stuff. 3 out of 10",3,12,26,2 January 2008
Duck Soup," Laugh out loud funny
","Groucho Marx is made President of a small nation and gives the country the leadership anyone foolish enough to put a Marx Brother in the Presidential Palace deserves A funny funny film about the insanity of politics, war and the people we are stupid enough to let govern us. I'm sure not all of the satire was intentional, but I know the laughs certainly were. This movie is a gem containing some of the funniest pieces in movie history, including Harpo's ever increasing war with a peanut vendor, the mirror sequence, the war sequence and the rapid fire one liners that everyone seems to be tossing about. This is 75 minutes of lunacy that will make you smile and realize that life really is worth living after all.",10,2,4,7 August 2005
Disturbia," Very good
","Really good version of Rear Window where a kid on house arrest realizes that his neighbor is a serial killer.While not scary as such (you can pretty much guess where this is going to go because it is by the numbers) this is a nice thrill ride that will keep you watching to the end. You like the kid and his friends and can sympathize with his plight. If there is a flaw its that the film could almost be a well made TV movie, there really is no reason this needed to be seen on the big screen (other than the attention a genuinely good thriller would attract). Still this is worth seeing though I'd wait for a bargain matin√©e or a rental on a rainy Saturday night once it comes out on DVD.",8,8,13,8 January 2008
Van Helsing," Its not a vampire its a turkey
","This movie is painful to watch. Why didn't some one stop director Stephen Sommers and his directorial excess is beyond me. I like The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, I even like Deep Rising, which this resembles in its desire to top itself at every turn.Van Helsing, a thousands year old man who works with the Vatican is sent off to fight Dracula, his brides, werewolves and the Frankenstein monster. Its everything to excess as the filmmakers rub your nose in everything that they've stolen by referring to every damned film they've ever seen.
Its awful.The opening sequence in black and white is meant to be a throw back to the Universal horror films of the 1930's and 40's, it comes off as if a bad jokey TV commercial. The next sequence of Van Helsing in Paris with Mr Hyde is clever and works, except that its a rip off of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen in the design of Hyde. At this point, with Van Helsing returning to the Vatican the film falls into an abyss of rip off mania, the worst being the Q like monk. You know Q from James Bond?From here its off to Dracula and its over blown over done sequence after sequence as more and more and more crap is thrown into the mix.Sommers has said that this is a film that he would have made when he was nine. Well did he have to regress himself and allow that nine year old to actually do so? Then again I can't see any nine year old actually liking this...Don't get me wrong, except for Igor's make up (which would have been bad twenty years ago) the effects and the technical film making and some of the script (not all) are okay, granted the effects can  shift from good to laughable but mostly they are okay. The problem is that the film doesn't have any sense holding it together. There is no sense of anything other than more is less.More is less is also true of the acting. With the sole exception of Hugh Jackman everyone over plays it.I spent most of this movie physically pained, batter by the over done nature of it and the fact that all I could help but think was 'this should have been better' over and over again.You don't need to give your money to the producers on this one. Only doing so will think we want a sequel and that would be a very bad thing. Stay home and begin a stamp collection, its a much more rewarding way to spend two hours.",3,1,3,8 May 2004
Monsters vs. Aliens," Its not that good
","Clever, but not funny animated film from Dreamworks is a unfunny comedy about monsters taking on a alien who wants the energy that is contained in one of the teams members.Lacking any real plot, think of it a sketch on the back of a wet paper napkin, this film has a tin of ideas and goes nowhere with them. There are some really good characters but they just seem to be there. There are essentially two action set pieces and a couple other sequences that attempt humor but nothing comes (actually all of the jokes are in the trailers and commercials).Its a shame because in Ginormica and her fellow monsters they have a winning band of creations, that almost nothing is done. Sadly it seems that a great deal of effort was spent in creating a world with depth for the 3D. I saw this in 2D and was impressed at how good it looked. Actually too good since everything seemed to be designed for maximum effect at the expense of the story (and the human characters who looked plastic).The only thing I really liked beyond the under used characters was the clever throw away bits and references to past scifi films I liked the references to Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, ET, Close Encounters,Kronos, Eath Vs The Flying Saucers, It Came From Beneath the Sea, Star Trek, etc.(though what is the Axel F theme doing in this movie?) I felt ripped off even at the bargain matin√©e price.I'd take a pass unless you have kids...",3,5,10,5 April 2009
Dreamgirls," Over-hyped
","One time front runner for many Oscars disappointed me. Sure the music is great as are most of the performances, but in making the Broadway show into something for the screen something was lost. Its clear how the show would play on stage and you understand how 'I'm Telling You I'm Not Going' brings down the house and makes those who sing it a star, but the mix of song and reality is an odd mix the movie never fully over comes. Is it a show or real? The movie never fully blurs the line so it never worked for me like in Chicago, or in the misfire adaptation of Rent. The performances are good, but limited by the source material. I also have to be a nay sayer to Jennifer Hudson's role as Effie. She do have pipes and she sells the songs, but there is an intensity thats missing. On a stage she could sell it but on the big screen its clear that she's play acting. I think she should not have gotten an Oscar, nor do I think the movie should as well....Its good, but not great",6,0,0,3 September 2007
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Good but overly silly
","This is the fictionalized story of a reporter who got on the trail of America's Psi warriors. These were, and are, a group of men trying to find ways of waging war via decidedly unconventional means such as psychic mind control and remote viewing. The film follows Ewan McGregor, as a reporter, who decides to go to Kuwait during the Gulf War and then on into Iraq , only to find he can't find away to go to where the action is. Instead he meets George Clooney and ends up on a wild ride into Iraq and into the world of the psychic soldiers.The film takes a straight forward book and pumps up the humor factor for its own purposes. The result is that much of material comes off as a decidedly silly send up of government running amok in the wrong direction. I'm not sure that the material really needed the puffing since what actually happened in some cases was actually funny enough on its own terms. The titled event, the story of a man staring at a goat in an effort to kill it with his mind, resulted in the man staring at the animal for something like 36 hours until it keeled over. I heard the book's author Jon Ronson on the radio and he is pretty sure that the goat just fell over from exhaustion rather than anything that was done to it by the person staring at it. The film turns it into something else entirely. What the soldiers go through is every 'new age' joke, when apparently the real soldiers played it much more seriously. As someone who's read about the military's attempts at using these unconventional means I was kind of disappointed that they played it so silly. Did all of these guys really need to be so crazy? I enjoyed it but at the same time I didn't love it like I thought I should have, I some how felt that it was too condescending. Very well acted its clear that everyone making the film was having a good time and that the film was a labor of love. The fact that everyone in the cast was really having a good time helps to sell the material more than it deserves.Ultimately it's a good but not great film and worth a look.",7,1,4,21 December 2009
Jarhead," Good war film about the wait to go to war and what happens when you get there
","The story of an enlisted Marine as he goes from signing up to the deserts of Saudi Arabia to wait for war, and then into battle during the first Gulf War.Reviews from friends have been mixed, nobody didn't like it, but some people were floored by it while others were less than impressed. Going in I didn't know what to expect.My reaction to the film is one of disappointed enjoyment. The problem for me is that the film becomes a series of loosely connected sequences that didn't hold together once we head for the desert. No doubt that this is the result of compressing the source down because you really can't show several hundred days of people doing nothing. All of the bits were excellent unto themselves but at the same time they didn't connect well to each other and so I became distracted with each jump in time.This isn't to say this isn't a good film, it is. Its a very good film that clearly shows the boredom of modern warfare. Hurry up and wait. In its way its a very good anti war film since it clearly shows that the military is not all fun and games. One guy I was talking to on a train the other day, loved the film. He also said that while he wanted to serve his country, he was going to look for other options since after seeing this film the excitement to boredom level seemed to be very low.Definitely worth seeing. Try to see it on the big screen where the empty vistas of sand will seem even more engulfing.7.5 out of 10",7,2,3,13 November 2005
Shrek Forever After," moments are great but the story is too well known for it to fully work
","Its a another remake of Its a Wonderful Life but with ogres and fairy tale characters.I'm really split about this film. They got so much right, the love between Shrek and Fiona for example, that you wonder why they bothered to remake a classic film. I mean the emotion and the bits work but the central plot is too worn and Rumpelstiltskin is too big a jerk Frankly had they managed to do something new, change the story around some how so it wasn't a direct steal this probably would be better, possibly the best of the films. But something doesn't work and despite getting so much dead on right there is a sense that they didn't care enough to completely make a full fledged film.Worth seeing, more so than the last two, but I'd wait for DVD...something I should have done.",6,1,2,13 June 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," One of the Best Fantasies on Film
","I was not crazy about the first film, and while the second film was better it still wasn't the be all and end all. This film is damn near close to being the be all and end all.Granted the acting is at times off by the two male leads,and Malfoy is too much of a wimp but for the most part this is everything that the first two films should have been but weren't. I have to credit the fact that this film was not directed by Chris Columbus, who is too light weight a director and was too faithful to the material. That is not the case here...Here the hero is director Alfonso Cuar√≥n, who made great dark fantasy by handling the material the way that it should have been handled. He made changes in the source, but kept everything focused on characters and plot. Best of all he made a movie that seems real, no matter how fantastic it gets, something that never happened in the first two films.I want to recommend this film to everyone, but I'm pretty certain you'll be best off if you watch one of the first two films to bring you up speed. It's worth it, trust me.",10,5,8,5 June 2004
Ratatouille," Good but not that good comedy doesn't hit its stride until the last half hour
","The story of Remy a rat with a unique sense of taste and smell who wants nothing more than to cook. Ending up in Paris at the restaurant run by his idol Remy links up with a garbage boy named Linguini in the quest for culinary greatness.Sue me I'm not in love with this film. Certainly the voice cast is great with a wonderful turn by Peter O'Toole and another by Ian Holm, and the animation pushes American animation farther than its gone before but the story was too unfocused and too much of been there done that.I'm a heathen I know but while I was watching this all I could think of was where I had seen this before from Looney Tunes to Pinky and The Brain to Peter Greenaway to Fantasia 2000 to Iron Giant to I don't know how many other films that seem to have been cribbed from. I don't mind borrowing but please don't give me the time to notice all of the riffs as I'm watching the movie. Clearly I've seen way too many movies for my own good since so much of this film seems borrowed.Its doesn't help that to me the film is unfocused for much of its running time. Once the film gets set in motion and Remy is introduced the film sort of staggers about trying to find its footing. There is no real conflict of consequence until the final half hour. Certainly there is the question of whether Remy and Linguini will make a team, but its not much of a threat since you know how it will have to play out, and the same can be said for Ian Holm's Skinner who is such a non threat that they have to add in a couple of out of left field plot twists just to keep things going (The letter from Linguini's mother and all that follows). Its not until Peter O'Toole's food critic resurfaces in the final reels that the film really begins to fire on all cylinders.This isn't to say its a bad film, it not, its just not the spectacular one that everyone sees in its animated frames. There are some great set pieces, the escape from the farm is wonderful for example, that are wonderfully animated pieces of art. And with out a doubt the final sequences as Remmy and Linguini have to come up with a plan to over come the 'evil' O'Toole are some of Brad Birds best work, but it comes at the end of a long meandering journey, which both lifts whats gone before and diminishes whats there.I like the film, probably more than I realize (hence the 7 out of 10 rating) but I'm not in love with it.",7,4,10,30 June 2007
Saw III," Looks great but makes no sense
","If you're a fan of the first two movies, this is more of the same and you don't need to read this, just go see the movie. If you didn't like the first two films this is more of the same and you don't need to see the film.More of the same from Jigsaw, a serial killer who wants people to experience 'life'.Say what you will the filmmakers know how to make a great looking grotesque film. The images from this film absolutely are stunning, as are their designs for the weapons of small scale destruction. I love the look of the film.What I don't like is the films mindless cruelty. People are abused in the nastiest way possible. There is no reasoning behind it, just cruelty like when the condemned were fed to the wild animals in the Roman arena. While I will admit its well done, I hate that there is nothing behind it. The murders have become like the films that made up the spate of slasher films from the late 1970's and early 1980's which degenerated into clever ways to die with nothing to hold them together.Worse is the films lack of logic. Never mind that Jigsaw has expired any number of times, how do this very elaborate death traps get made and built and attached to unsuspecting people in such short notice. It makes no sense? I know its not suppose to, but there should be an internal logic to it all and any hope of that ended with the first film.This won't matter to any fans who are looking for the cool ways to die. I leave the film to the fans I'm going to go read a good book, Marquis de Sade anyone?",3,4,9,2 November 2006
Spirited Away," See this in English
","This is the rare bird thats better in English. I had picked up an import copy of this film prior to the English Disney release and was stunned at how much I didn't like it. Thinking I was mad after all the hype I watched the film seven times in the next seven days and was underwhelmed each time. When the John Lasseter supervised dub was finally released to theaters I went more to show support than out of desire to see the film again. Seeing the film in English was a revelation. Even for some one who has watched thousands of anime in Japanese I had to admit that the tiny little touches that were added made the film better and more understandable on an emotional level. This is a great film for everyone, but if English is your first language see it in English its so much better.",9,3,8,26 February 2004
Tropic Thunder," Not my cup of blood
","I hate Ben Stiller. Actually I really dislike him. Some times he's okay some times he's not. I find his sense of humor often obvious and stupid. So with that in mind is it any wonder that I had problems with Tropic Thunder? The plot of the film has a director of a mega-action epic unable to control his stars and in desperation drops them in the jungle with some notes telling them to make it up as they go along. The problem is things instantly turn real, though the dunderheads don't realize it at first.Scattershot film satire on Hollywood is often too much of a not so good thing. Beginning with one of the bloodiest sequences in any war film (its so over the top that its played for laughs even as it disgusts) the film drives head long at deflating everything Hollywood and superstar. No one and nothing is left unscathed. The problem is that the humor runs from dead on to brain dead stupid. Much of it seems to be funny if you're on the inside of Hollywood, which I'm not so the performances fall flat. Tom Cruise's much heralded portrait of a studio exec left me scratching my head yea he's like a lot of management people I know but whom ever he was referencing was lost on me.(How funny one finds the film seems to run in relation to how much knows about Hollywood. The more my friends know the funnier they find it, the less they know the more they dislike it) Other bits like the now infamous 'retard' discussion are really well done on an intellectual level, but at they don't work as performed. Stiller is much to knowing in his direction and you never believe he's not aware that the camera is right there with him.The easiest way to know if you're going to like this is know if you find Ben Stiller and his films like Zoolander and Cable Guy funny. If you do you have a shot.I liked it in pieces and in theory but not as a whole.And yes Robert Downey is excellent as a white guy pretending to be black.",3,11,20,28 August 2008
Enchanted," Lots of fun-more so if you know all the Disney fairy tale cartoons
","Disney pokes fun at itself and makes a glossy fairytale in the process. Animated princess is banished to the real world by a wicked queen, where its hoped she will stay forever. However the not too bright price follows suit as does a wicked henchmen. As the characters try to find each other and their way back romance blooms and the wicked queen fumes. I liked this movie. It helps that I've seen most if not all of the Disney fairy tales that are being sent up so the jokes played a little funnier. For example I loved the princess calling for help from her furry friends to clean the apartment and having rats, cockroaches and pigeons show up. The cast is mostly good, with only Idina Menzel, Tony winner for Wicked, being not really up to the material. She plays Patrick Dempsey's fianc√© and seems off (as she often does on film and TV). Definitely worth a look, especially if you've seen all the Disney fairy tales, mores o if you've seen them more than once.",8,1,3,5 January 2008
Resident Evil," After a classic first half hour this is done in by crappy monsters
","This story of the walking dead in a secret government base is very disappointing. In all honesty I expected to despise this film and then was shocked when the first half hour leading up to the zombies, was a tight, scary horror film of the highest order.And then the zombies show up and it all falls into the toilet. The problem with this movie is that the monsters are so badly acted and so awful looking it takes away from any tension because you are laughing at them. Such is the problem with most post-Dawn of the Dead films, the people playing zombies over act and destroy the mood. Chalk it up to awful direction, or non direction of the crowds of zombies.If you can get past the laughter this is a good film. Many people I've told about the laughable monsters, liked the film when they saw it themselves, I on the other hand can't be as forgiving because I loved the opening that much.Try it, but expect to laugh more than you scream.5 out of 10 (purely because of the zombie, the rest is pretty good)",5,0,1,12 September 2004

","Picking up where Casino Royale left off Bond is on the trail of the organization behind Le Chiffre (villain in Casino) as well as seeking to get revenge for the death of Vesper Lynde. The main bad guy is Dominic Greene of the Green Corporation with ties to something larger. Greene is buying up land all over the world for some unknown reason. Everyone thinks oil but there is something else afoot.Extremely well made, with stunning set pieces this is a movie that starts and goes from almost the instant the film begins. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. Good, in that it keeps you watching to see what is going to happen next. Bad in that it conceals plot that is decidedly less then detailed (as are some of the characters). There is no sense of a bigger picture, its just Bond charging on. Its not bad, but its not great either. The film, in its way feels like a side story or middle part to something larger since the main plot only serves to let us know that some large menace is in the wings.I do like the film, but I'm really torn between loving the action (even if it feels Bourne-ish) and feeling blah about the plot. Still reservations aside its worth a popcorn and a soda, so if you get the chance do see it.somewhere around 7 out of 10.",7,6,13,17 November 2008
Gone with the Wind," Warning: laughing at this movie could get you slapped
","I should know I've sunk several relationships simply by saying I found this movie to be funny. I've gotten assaulted by women who've insisted that if I watched this movie with them I wouldn't find it funny.This is a great achievement in all areas of film making, except one, that one is the acting. Never in my life have I witnessed so many good actors and actresses going so far into parody that I'm convulsed with laughter every time I watch their work. If you think I'm joking about how bad the acting is, please tell me one other movie that when spoofed or joked about simply requires the lines from the film to be rendered as in the film to be fall down funny? None.Only Clark Gable gives anything approaching a real performance. If you don't believe me then try behaving as people do in this film and see if you're not viewed as if you've gotten a second head.Of course this film is a classic and I'm in the minority so you probably shouldn't take my word on it.",1,39,101,28 June 2004
Alien vs. Predator," One of the Best of the Year
","First off, you MUST get away from the fan boy mentality. Forget the fact its not rated R, that it tinkers with a bit of alien lore, and accept that the visual effects are just okay at times- The fight on the ice in particular. If you take this for what it is, and on its own terms then you will find that this is quite simply one of the best action films in ages, and a worthy addition to both franchises.The plot has a pyramid discovered under the ice on an island near Antarctica. A scientific team is dispatched and very quickly they realize that something isn't right. Proceeding under the ice they find that the pyramid links to many ancient cultures. They also find out what its real purpose is to provide a safe place to hunt for the Predators, unfortunately by that time, its way too late for team. I loved this movie. Seeming to pull chunks of story from any number of the Alien and Predator comics and novels the film makers have fashioned one hell of a ride. I do not know the last time the audience applauded the events on the screen, that they screamed and yelled and talked out loud in nervously. This movie exceeded my expectations and then some.See this movie. Its a flawed guilty pleasure of the highest order.10 out of 10.",10,3,8,14 August 2004
No Country for Old Men," I like it, but I think its been over praised and over hyped
","I'm going to have to think about this film a while. I watched the new Cohen Brothers film because of all the best picture nods its gotten in the last couple of days. Clearly my thoughts on the film have been colored by the high esteem the film has.I like it I don't don't love it. Deeply Philosophical and existential western chase film seems to have been put on the screen to win awards. The film seems more allegory than real with a few twists (the late night move by Josh Brolin that makes everything come together is clearly deus ex machina- actually it makes it Greek tragedy since that one act is the weakness that brings down the wrath of the god(s).) and its drive to be about something deeper helped keep the film at arms length for me. Actually the real problem was I never liked Josh Brolin's character. He is marginally better than his pursuer and I never really felt I knew him enough to care. Brolin's Moss' every man in conflict with force of nature/hand of malevolent God Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh isn't someone I could identify with except as a literary notion of a flawed Gary Cooperesque character. These are archetypes not real people. Its so arch and over the top-at least to me- that I wanted to laugh at the silliness of the machismo (though Anton Chigurh is probably one of the five most malevolent characters ever to walk across the screen). I'm curious what the film would be if the Greek chorus bits with Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson were removed since I think its these often oblique passages, while genuinely thought provoking, are the reason that everyone feels the film is something more than a good western tale. (What if we had a Greek chorus commenting on the events in the James Brolin film Night of the Juggler, would that have made it more than a chase film?) I really DO like the film, I just can't believe that the film has been so invested with such deep meaning (Things thought of while watching the movie: The end of Greed; the failed Cohen brother's attempt at filming James Dickey's To the White Sea; any number of 1930's or 40's westerns;Zane Grey and Louis L Amour Westerns; Mindwalk;Frankensteins pursuit of his creation into the wastes; ...and a few other things-several other bleak chase films- that have started to fade with the lateness of the hour) Oh yea and as for the off screen events that people have complained about...I think they're crazy. I think we see what we need to.7.5 out of 10",7,3,6,5 January 2008
The Love Guru," Amusing, but not really funny. The problem is Meyers goes to the well one time too many
","Mike Meyers makes an amusing (to some degree) but not really funny comedy that is far from the worst film of the year.The plot has Meyers as Guru Picka who is second to Deepak Chopra. In a bid to be come number one (and get a shot at Oprah) he must get a hockey player back with his wife and his team to win the Stanley Cup.Most of this movie doesn't have any laughs. Its not for trying, oh how they try, the problem is that most if not all of the humor is a retread of many other Mike Meyers films. There are songs (clever for a few seconds each), breaking the fourth wall, guest stars and other things which for the most part you've seen it all (especially when Meyers references himself). Its amusing and its clever at times but most of the jokes fall flat. It doesn't help that more than a good many of them consist of jokes involving bodily function, sex or the lowest common denominator, all of which are fine, so long as the punchline isn't painfully obvious which they are here (like most of the puns which we've seen before).This isn't to say there are no laughs, Stephen Colbert is wickedly funny as a hockey announcer and much of the abuse Verne Troyer humor produce a chuckle or two at the very least. There are also a couple of genuine attempts at humor in the final moments that work, but mostly this is a misfire of a comedy.Is it the worst film of the year? No. Frankly I think this will revive on cable and DVD when people realize that its not as bad as people have made it out to be. (Its certainly better than its lousy reputation). Actually I think once it hits cable where people don't have to pay for it will be the point it takes off. I was amused and I stayed to the end which says volumes especially at a post 10pm showing.Just over 5 out of 10.A word of warning- this should have been rated R. The jokes really push hard in the R-rated direction with elephants probably really making this too much for little ones.",5,7,18,5 July 2008
District 9," Heady mix of ideas and action is a welcome blast of fresh air in the scifi world
","Very Very Good.I'm still processing the film. It will need much thought and a second viewing. Not because it was bad, rather because even being told what the film is and how it behaves (it bounces between documentary style and narrative film style) the film is not what I expected. It doesn't help that the trailers and commercials only gave us a taste of the film, there is so much more to it.The plot is that the aliens came to earth 30 years before. They are stranded here and have been placed into District 9 which devolves into a ghetto. The humans living around them don't want them there any more so they are forcibly moved...and thats when things go sideways as the man in charge of the move ends up sprayed with something and begins to change. Part documentary part action film this is a unique film that does and moves in its own way.(The basic plot is not new, but what it does with it is) A couple of months ago Moon was being tossed about as the next big thing. I thought not. This is certain to get a similar buzz and I think this is a better candidate. At the same time this is bound to be over hyped but as some one who was ready to knock the film down for being over loved by critics and scifi fans, the over hype is heartfelt and not that far from the truth. Its a very good film, is it great I don't know but it certainly doesn't suck.Yes you want to see this if you like scifi or action films.",9,12,20,16 August 2009
Mamma Mia!," I prefer the show but this was very good
","How was the movie? Good but not the show.As many of you know the story is of twenty year old Sophie sending letters to her three possible fathers who show up the day before her wedding and cause her mom and herself to melt down.Instead of a theatrical world of basically one ever changing set this is set in a 'real place' or as near to one as you're likely to find in a movie musical. Its directed by someone who only occasionally manages to pull it all together to the magical level of the Broadway/West End show.(she never directed a film before) When it soars (Dancing Queen/ Slipping Through my Fingers/ Super Trooper) it is pure bottled joy. The Dancing Queen sequence is one of the best I've ever run across for expressing happiness. Most of the time the music is okay and gets the job done in a purely workman like way. At the same time I really wish Phyllida Lloyd had been more imaginative. There are flashes in almost every sequence but very few that truly soar as high as they should.Most of the cast is good vocally though Amanda Seyfried is excellent and then some but who in the hell let Brosnan sing undubbed. Its horrible. You do not get used to it, its horrible.If I was to zero in on the biggest problem it would be the script. At times its a great improvement over the book of the show with dialog that actually could be real world but in compressing a two and a half hour show to hundred five minutes they removed several songs (adding one new one for Brosnan-eeeek) and removing a great deal of character (and some plot) development. Is it any wonder that they cast stars in the male leads? They mostly have nothing to do and stand out because of personality. The Rosie/Bill romance is an after thought, as is the flirtation between Tanya and the bartender.(and as for Harry being gay---could you please make up your mind) Honestly they chopped it up in places its understandable why people hate the film.I like it. I love pieces of it. I still prefer the show (which I will go see it several more times before it closes-even at Broadway prices)...but this is still pretty good with many smile inducing moments a a couple of eyes tear up from joy ones as well.7 out of 10. Its light and frothy and empty and fun.For the record- depending upon how you count it about 7 songs were removed from the show for the film-though some show up as music cues and end credits songs",7,3,4,11 November 2008
Twilight," Odds are you've seen this all before better
","Good looking teen vampire story, that looks good and is about teen vampires. Clearly I'm the wrong person for this YA teen angst vampire tale because I found it the sort of thing thats been done before I don't know how many times (underworld,Lost Boys...). Not a bad film, its just the sort of thing that is aimed at its one audience and really no one else. Certainly the story feels YA, much like City of Ember, even if they try to make it more adult. Frankly this is a movie for fans of the book only (then again I know many fans of the book who hate the film). Yes the cast is good, but the plot just doesn't cut it.(Your choice out of 10. The rating is dependent upon how you feel about the source material and how many times you've seen similar stories)",5,3,7,9 December 2008
The Pianist," Over-rated story of survival
","I don't know what to say about this move other than it really didn't movie me. Sure Adrian Brody is excellent as the Pianist of the title who hides out in Warsaw as the city is destroyed around him, but I never really connected to the story. I never really cared. I'm not sure if its poor film making or simply the fact that for me this seemed as been there and done that. Many of the things that I dislike in the well financed movies concerning the Holocaust came into play, in particular the fact that everything looks so nice as to be unreal. I also have the sense that the film is insisting that I like and respect it simply because of the subject matter. Its not that simple you have to give me characters and a good story before I care. Unfortunately while Brody is an excellent actor however I never connected to him. I never had a reason to care other than what happened was truly remarkable, which means this movie meant nothing to me. This film is a major disappointment",4,5,17,7 August 2005
The Transporter," Great Popcorn action film, is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time.
","I love this movie.I've seen it I don't know how many times since its release and I never seem to get tired of it.The plot is simple. Frank is man who will transport anything anywhere so long as you follow his rules. For Frank the rules are what keeps him safe and out of trouble. Of course Frank breaks one of the rules and he suddenly find himself on the run with a girl in tow with police and the bad guys on his tail.This film has great characters who say very funny things, the exchanges between Frank and the police officer name Taconi is wonderfully funny and knowing. It has incredible action the likes of which you've probably never seen, the opening chase is one of the best ever put on film, and o course the battle in the oil.Its a wonderful film that completely falls apart dramatically in the second half. Once Frank and the girl come face to face with the two bad guys, the film ceases to make logical sense. Whats going on (apparently a plot to smuggle Chinese into France, though its not really clear) is less important than getting Frank to the next action scene. Whats so troubling is that even after 30 or 40 viewings it feels like the film makers never had a clear direction past a certain point in the story. Its not fatal, but it is annoying.Plot collapse or no, this is a great film that really should be seen. Its just two hours of good fun, and great times.(Besides it sets you up for the sequel, which in many ways is better than this, even though it too has plot problems)",9,1,4,3 September 2005
Seabiscuit," too much like a PBS docudrama
","Its a well made film that reminds me of a PBS special in both good ways and bad ways.I know several people who are raving about it and how wonderful it is. Personally I've seen better.There are a couple of problems with the movie, the first is that you know how its going to end. You know this for two reasons, first they don't make big feel good dramas about losers, and second the movie is so manipulative you know where its going.all you have to do is listen to the music.The movie is too long by at least twenty minutes, probably more, my interest only took hold about 45 minutes in.To say the women in this movie are give the short shrift is being kind, they do nothing, look good, and little else. Then again this is a movie of few words by numerous longing looks. Everyone looks but very few say anything or do anything. Frankly without the narration (PBS anyone?) the film would sink under its own weight.There is either too much back story, the first half hour, or not enough. I kept feeling that this is a longer film waiting to break out.Technically three and a half stars, story and emotionally two and a half. Its not as good as it thinks it is.Should you go? What was your opinion of the trailer? Mine was what I thought of the film.And thankfully Bridges quickly tires of replaying Tucker.",5,2,4,19 January 2008
Revolutionary Road," Mannered dress up tale of a crumbling marriage didn't work for me
","Sam Mendes is back in crumbling family territory with this adaptation of a Richard Yates novel about the implosion of a family in early 1960's American suburbia. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet play the Wheelers. We see how they meet at a party and then we flash forward to Kate performing in a not very good local theater production which leads into a heated argument on the way home. From there we watch as the pair try to navigate their life together and in the suburban wasteland around them.I'm not going to lie I found this a tough slog. I never really clicked with the material for a variety of reasons and so found myself squirming in my seat. The main problem for me is that the film seemed more like a dress up affair rather then real people. Everything is spotless in the way that suburbia is always pictured to be, but never really was except when some people were having guests. Everything in the entire film is picture perfect and artificial. It could be argued that this is the way the characters see the world, but when it extended to Leo's office where there was nary a sign of any work on anyones desk I had to throw up my hands. Mendes maybe making a point but at the same time I found it all terribly obvious.The performances are good with the exception of Kathy Bates who is so loud and obnoxious as to unbalance the rest of the film. I know that in some way she is a form of Greek Chorus but at the same time one had wished that she was a little less noisy. (Though it makes the final image more understandable from both the context of the scene it self and the film as a whole.) Give it a shot if you like the stars or like dress up tragedy.",5,8,17,28 December 2008
28 Days Later...," Original first half is followed by a good, but by the numbers second
","The story of a plague that has turned most of the population in to crazed 'zombies' is for the most part a great new twist on the now well worn tale. Danny Boyle has created a wonderful horror classic that takes you into new territory just when you've begun to think you've seen it all before.The first half of this film is some of the best horror film making of the last twenty years or so. Simply put a man wakes up from a coma to find the world in ruins and most of the world now blood thirsty monsters. Staggering around England he ends up with a group of people who try to get out of the city to a safe place in the country. Filled with great set pieces this part of the film raises your expectations for a bang up second half and the genre itself.Unfortunately the military arrive and things shift gears as the movie becomes something else. Its not a totally bad change, what happens is quite good, but after a first half t which effectively rewrites the rules of the genre we get a tale that seems like we've been there and done that. The flight to the countryside becomes literally housebound and it stagnates in ideas that are good but which we've already seen.That said, see this movie. Its a great kick in the pants, even if the second half isn't on the classic level of the first.",7,7,12,16 April 2005
Cars," Worst Pixar feature is a slow dull retread of movies you've seen before
","I've seen Cars twice now I didn't like it either time.For me this tale of a jerk who makes good is a technical tour de force as the Pixar animators push the envelope as far as one can in rendering a realistic world in an animated film. I'm not sure if thats a good thing since the cartoonish nature of the cars grates against the realistic world. I found it jarring and unpleasant to look at. It also creeped me out since the eyes of the cars looked dead and unresponsive. Sure the lids lifted and they moved back and forth, but they never changed they always remained static and equidistant.A HUGE problem for me is that the Pixar guys have made a world of cars that looks exactly like our world, but which is is only filled with cars, there are no people. This would be fine except for the fact that if you think about it it doesn't make sense, how could cars have made everything we see? You can't argue people since we see cars in places they should be in houses and in the race stands. Yes I know its a cartoon, but at the same time it destroys the one thing a cartoon must have to work on any level and that is internal consistency and logic. This film doesn't have it at all.I hated that I felt that I'd seen this movie before a thousand other times in a thousand other movies. It was so bad that I was pretty much guessing what the next line of dialog was going to be. Worse this film felt like an eternity during its time on the screen. If you're going to give me left overs the least you could do is give them to me faster so I don't have time to notice they're stale.Major disappointment from Pixar. (I saw it the second time because I couldn't believe it was that bad) Wait for video.",4,3,15,18 June 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Haven't I seen this before?
","While this is far from a bad movie, it is certainly one of the most over rated films of the last ten or fifteen years. I don't hate this movie, I just can't understand why this film was noticed when China and the rest of the Orient are turning out films equal to, if not better than this one.The story of pairs of lovers is interesting but its nothing that hasn't been told before and gave the film a strong sense of deja vu. I was marking off how many plot points in my head I got right while I watched the film and found I was pretty much right down the line.(A side note, this is based on, I think, the fourth book in a series so there are numerous references to events that happened earlier between characters. While this gives a sense of the characters being grounded it also is frustrating since there seems to be many times events in this film are echoing events in the past) If you've been watching Hong Kong films (or even Hollywood films over the past few years for that matter) you've seen the wire work that wowed many people when this film first came out. For many people the technical brilliance of something they have never been exposed to is the selling point. For me it was just been there done that.In the end I was left wondering if that was all there, and apparently it was.Despite my disappointment I suggest you try it. Just don't expect the bells and whistles.",7,2,4,14 March 2004
Insidious," it has moments but mostly its a waste and only scary because of a sudden loud noise
","I saw a sneak preview of Insidious at Lincoln Center last night. There was much ballyhoo with the director, writer and stars in attendance. The film was talked up as being the next big thing in horror and as one of the scariest movies in years. Sadly the film didn't live up to it's hype.The story of the film has family moving into a new house where weird things begin to happen. When one son falls into a coma and the weirdness begins to increase the family decides to change houses yet again. Unfortunately the problem was never the house, and the weirdness moves with them. I could tell you more but should you want to see the film yourself I think you should have some pretense of being surprised (which is hard since the story is so worn out you'll know way before everyone else what is going on) The film is being marketed as being a film with no false scares, and that is true to some degree. There are no false jumps anywhere in the film. Unfortunately there aren't that many real scares anywhere in the film at all. There are jumps and starts, but few real scares. It's not that they aren't there it's simply that Director James Wan under cuts everyone of them by adding an exclamation point of VERY LOUD music with almost each one. The two creepiest moments, the first a figure behind a crib works because the noise doesn't come until after we've seen the figure for our selves. The other is a small figure in the background as Rose Byrne walks past it is scary in a 'did I just see this' sort of way. The rest of the scares are undercut, as if Wan doesn't trust the audience. It's terrible and tiring.If that wasn't bad enough the script, or at least the film that was cut together by Wan (he edited it) is derivative and unimaginative. The plot is basically a combination of Poltergeist, The Entity, Psychic Killer and any number of really cheap films from the 70's and 80's. Watching the film I was struck by how so many elements seemed to have been taken from other better and worse films. I kept thinking that if this was like movie X then Y would happen and sure enough it would. Almost nothing in this film seems original (even one of the creatures seems a copy of Darth Maul in Star Wars). Even worse, where most other horror films have occasional moves by the characters that are clearly stupid, illogical or the sort of thing that any rational person wouldn't do, this film is full of them. The plot hinges on repeated and frequent trips to the well of character stupidity, including a move at the end which assures a sequel.(I won't talk about the how unintentionally funny it is)How can anyone feel this is the next big thing? Yes I applaud the lack of gore and false scares but outside of that what is there to keep your interest? Watching the film I was mostly bored. I wanted to walk out, but I waited to the end hoping that the film would pull itself together. It never happened and I walked before the director Q&A. I didn't care and anything I would have said to them would have been very impolite.That said, the film does have moments. There are a few moments when the film creates tension and some truly frightening images, but they are wrapped up and hidden in a film that looks like it was made by a someone who was making his first film, not someone who's made one classic horror film (Saw) and few near misses.If you must wait for TV.",3,15,50,4 March 2011
Bolt," So much better than I thought it would be, but having seen it I don't need to see it ever again
","Solid and good film about a dog who doesn't know he's not a super hero who escapes from his pampered existence when he thinks his human has been kidnapped by the man with green eyes. Enjoyable and breezy the film is completely unremarkable other than the occasional one liner or throw away gag. I enjoyed. It was fun but I never need to see it again.Why isn't this a great film? There are any number of reasons.-A good number of the gags are in the trailers -once you know the set up it kind of just follows the course it set out -it looks like every other computer generated animated movie -Its as manufactured as the show Bolt stars in. -The music is unremarkable-to the point I noticed it wasn't all that hotWhat would have been great would have been had the film been made in 2-D animation like the end credits. Had they done that it might have been something to see.As it stands now its a good film, but utterly disposable.

","Scientists discover that in 2012 the world was going to end with a massive global shift. When the year comes John Cusack attempts to save his family from the impending doom.There is no honest way to review this film. As a drama the film is laughably bad. Its simply awful and one of the worst in the truly awful pantheon of disaster films. If you've seen films like When Time Ran Out or some of the Japanese doomsday movies from the 1970's you'll have a good idea how bad this all is. Then again I can't see anyone wanting to see this for the sterling dialog.As a showcase for special effects and destruction this film is amazing. If you've ever wanted to see California slide into the ocean here's your chance. Let me be honest the destruction in the film is incredible and way cool and is the reason to see this film. Its just about as far as you can go in showing the world being destroyed and still feel good at the end. Its amazing.If you like cool special effects give this film a shot, but wait for home video where you can crank up your home theater and crack the walls.

The Number 23," Despite a good turn by Jim Carrey, this film doesn't really work
","Jim Carrey turns in a good performance in Joel Schumacher's confused and confusing thriller. The plot has Carrey stumbling upon a book that mirrors his own life and suggests that the world is governed by the number 23. Murder and madness follow in a not very clear (its one of those movies that get so confusing that at a certain point you're told whats happening), and not very good thriller. Made on the cheap for a a budget equal to Carrey's regular salary this isn't all that great, its not bad, but its not very good. The only reason to see it is Carrey who turns in a performance that is nothing like the wacko ones he does in his comedies. I'd wait for cable",4,1,4,3 September 2007
Ghost Rider," Once Ghost rider shows up this is a great deal of fun
","Clunky comic adaptation is some where toward the middle of the pack of big screen comic stories. After the set up of young Johnnie Blaze selling his soul to save his dad, the story jumps ahead to Johnnie as supreme motorcycle daredevil. He reunites with his childhood sweetheart (left because of guilt over what happened to his dad) just as Mephistopheles returns to have Johnnie fulfill his end of the bargain. Blaze must stop Blackheart from getting a contract for 1000 souls which will result in hell on earth. Mephistopheles sweetens the pot by promising Johnnie his freedom if he completes the task. And with that Ghost Rider is reborn.After a slow set up the movie kicks into high gear with the first appearance of Ghost Rider. Here we have the comic come to life and its fun on a purely comic level. This is not the deep musing of Spiderman, the solid novel like quality of Batman Begins, nor the the misdirected but interesting occult Constantine, this is the sort of thing that regularly graced the 22 pages of the comic book in four colors, its pure mindless cheese that hooks you on the 'oh thats so cool' level of the visuals and ideas, even though it makes no logical sense. It hasn't been pumped up for real movie life, rather its the comic come to life, with its lack of complexity intact. Sue me I liked the film-or at least I did once Ghost Rider shows up. Its just those neat panels I used to read up there on the big screen. Classic? I think not. Mindless popcorn flick? most definitely. If you take it on its terms I think you'll enjoy it, especially once it gets going. Hell, it even has Sam Elliot, what more could you want?

The Lives of Others," Excellent and truly Oscar worthy
","Yes it is better than Pan's Labyrinth True (?) story about an East German Stasi agent who is so good at interrogation and observation that he's brought in to observe a well known writer and director, who is in theory above suspicion. As he begins to listen to the daily life of the writer and his girlfriend he finds that his life isn't what he thought it was.At times cold and clinical this is movie is at once the type of movie that draws you in and keeps you at a distance. You're drawn in because you want to see whats going on, you're kept at a distance because our central figure is, at first very icy. All that changes as things go on as we, and he gets to know not only the people he's watching, but also because we, and he learns that the reasons for his watching the couple are something less than political. This is a movie that sucks you up and takes you along for the ride. If there is a flaw, its that the film, even when it warms up, still remains oddly detached.I honestly can't argue with the win for best Foreign Language film at this years Oscars.A potential word of warning- this is a talky film at times. The result is that the subtitling can be a bit of a battle as too many words go by too fast. It happens three or four times in the film, as part of wordy exchanges. Its nothing damaging but you may want to wait for DVD where you an back it up and play the line again.",9,1,2,3 September 2007
Hellboy," They Got Everything Right But the Pacing
","Having been a Hellboy fan for years I've been looking forward to the movie since it was announced. Now that I've seen it I'm of mixed minds. First off its one of the most faithful adaptations of a comic ever put on the screen where everything looks and feels right. The trouble is that the term leadenly paced doesn't do it justice, despite action sequence after action sequence this movie fails to move at all. Yes, all of the inter-personal relationships are scenes are fine, but anything that has to do with action or the villains is motionless. After an hour I was fighting a desperate battle to remain awake and the person I saw this with had to keep being nudged because they were snoring. What a slow slow movie. Wait for video and then keep the remote handy.",7,2,3,5 April 2004
Schindler's List," Split Personality
","To me this story of Schindler is a split personality of a film. On one hand its stark black and white photography and realistic view of life in the ghetto and the camp is a kick in the heart. The problem is what should have been a stark gripping in your face take on the Nazi destruction of those it hated is undercut by a classic MGM 1940's style photography in every other scene. I kept thinking one of the great directors of the period was making this and not Spielberg. To me it has always felt that Spielberg waffled on the subject because he feared what the reaction would be.
Its not a bad film, its just not the great one it wants to be.",6,2,9,6 March 2004
Across the Universe," Flawed masterpiece musical love story.
",Boy from Liverpool meets a young girl and falls in love while the events of the late 1960's transpire around them. Its all set to the music of the Beatles.Julie Taymor has fashioned a musical that tries to do too much (cover the social upheavals of second half of the decade) while skimping on plot (the love story kind of is never fully developed-it just is taken for granted). thankfully her choice to use the Beatles classics drives the film forward when all else fails. The music brings the emotions the story is lacking. Lets face it there are times I was reduced to tears- the first time was the stunning Let It Be. Most of the musical segments are 'Wow' inducing treats that get an added kick by the flimsy plot line.This is one of those movies you'll want to share with people because it is an amazing (though flawed) experience. I can't wait to dive back in. 8 out of 10.(A special treat-Joe Cocker),8,0,1,30 March 2008
The Incredibles," Good, not great
","This is Pixar's tale of a superhero family in hiding, trying to cope with everyday life, only to have to step back into action when a villain seeks to destroy them and take over the world.I like this film, I don't love it. I find that I really like all of the pieces but how they are put together and the pace at which they story unfolds kind of makes this a chore to get through. Trust me I am a huge superhero fan (I've had to get a storage locker for my comic collection) so it has nothing to do with the superhero s part of the story. Its just that this story just seems to ramble on and on in very good sequences which seem to me to be more about being clever than anything else. Actually I'm rambling here and the real point of this is I have no idea why this film is two hours long. Its really good, but someone need to tell Brad Bird the pace just doesn't work.Still its a good film, though it should have been great.",Null,1,2,27 October 2009
The Mist," As disturbing as they come. Its not whats out there thats scary its whats in here with us
","After a horrific storm that came out of no where a mist rolls into a strip mall where residents are stocking up on goods to tide them over until the power comes on. Unfortunately there is something (actually things) in the mist and they are hungry.One of the most profoundly disturbing horror films I've ever seen. I'm shaking all over. This is a masterpiece of visceral horror. Its black as night with almost no hope. As the film progresses people turn on each other, egged on by Marsha Gay Harden as a religious zealot. Its a frightening thing.The fear and terror comes not so much what we are seeing (frankly I really wish that there had been less CGI since its a little too clear at times its not real) rather from the oppressive mood thats created. There is a minimal use of music so its just the sounds of the people and the mist and nothing to block it out. The scary scenes are not the way cool monsters its the lack of monsters, its when nothing is happening or when people are fighting or simply discussing. Who needs to see the things that go bump in the night? Not perfect, the film still shakes you up. It left me profoundly disturbed and uneasy.See this film if you want to be shaken at your core.And yes the ending has been changed from the story. The ending is a black as any American film I've ever seen. Even if you can guess the end it will still leave you shaken.",10,5,11,24 December 2007
Stardust," I like it not love it-I'm just pecked to death by little flaws...which I'll tell you about...(SPOILERS)
","(Contains lots of spoilers) Too long ago I read the source novel by Neil Gaiman, or rather half, stopping not because the story was bad but rather because I disliked the way the story is told. I'm of a similar mind concerning the film adaptation.First and foremost I have to say I like the film. Its an okay time killer. Its not the be all and end all that some people have claimed-most recently a person in my office who basically accosted me with her 'best film' talk. Its an okay film thats wounded by some deep flaws. Keep in mind I do like the film (even as I break it into pieces) Do I need to tell the plot or can we just assume that most people reading this already know the story is that a young man promises to get a falling star for his lady love never imagining that the star would be a young woman.As a fantasy film it looks pretty good, though to be perfectly honest in the bootleg copy I've looked at actually looks better since its less 'flashy Hollywood dress up'. The effects mostly work and I don't think I can really fault the film on a technical level.The problems for the most part are two fold,namely some of the casting and the script or perhaps the work of Matthew Vaughn (and sometimes both at the same time).Sienna Miller is wasted and her part so badly written that there is no sense why Charlie Cox has any interest in her- other than she looks beautiful. She is bland. The same can be said for Claire Danes who looks good but is so incredibly dull. She radiates nothing as the love interest at all. Robert DeNiro looks good but his fay reading of Shakespeare is often amusing but more often than not really belongs in another movie. Its a choice, which like several other 'knowing' choices that make me want to slap director Matthew Vaughn around.Let me get into the script and Vaughn's choices. First off the knowing nods that pervade the film wobble it. If the film had been a knowing homage like the Princess Bride (damn I didn't want to mention that) where most of it is tongue in cheek things would be fine, but Vaughn wants to have to it both ways, he wants a serious fantasy with a hero and villains but he also wants to be silly and send it up.Examples? The way Michelle Pfeiffer looks in the mirror seems much too out of date. We have Captain Shakespeare being overly swishy, which doesn't quite work, we have some of Ricky Gervais' schtick being anachronistic and we have the ghosts of the dead which serve no purpose except to act as redundant Greek chorus and to take an edge off the blood letting. They made me think that they had some left overs make up designs from Pirates of the Caribbean and since Vaughn was such a fan of the Frighteners he decided to use them. Is the movie silly or serious, I don't think the film knows and it cuts down the suspense since neither the witches nor the princes (especially the princes) are ever truly frightening.The other thing that really bothers me is that it makes no sense internally. Never mind that its top heavy with foreshadowed contrivances (oh please I knew how it was going to go from the start) and cheats (candle), this movie makes no real sense whats so ever.Want examples? How long was the trip on the sky boat? There's a long sequence of Shakespeare teaching Tristan and yet the time that passes for the witch and the princess seems so much less. Even if its not how fast did Tristan learn? The unicorn would never have brought Danes to the inn. Why? because if it would know about the other dangers it would know that the whole place was bad.How can the magic (candle) work in Wall when there is some inference that once you cross the wall the magic is gone.The climax in the witches castle doesn't play right from the cutting of the strap onward.There are more instances but those are the ones immediately stand out (The Unicorn one got me shhhhhed when I said that the unicorn would never have taken her to the inn out loud.) I could go on and I could dismantle the film (pieces that serve no purpose, The out of place music, the over done riding shots, the goats-which sound good on paper but make no practical sense) but I don't see the point. Its the type of film you're either going to love for what it is flaws and all or you're going to find annoying because it pecks you to death with little details. Personally I've been pecked.A good but not great movie. Certainly not something I need to see again, but which is worth seeing with a bag of popcorn and soda in the right sort of mind-frame.Strangely I'm very disappointed. I know some thought I would hate the film and dismiss it out of hand, but I don't, and I'm not. Actually its good enough that I'm really angry that its not better. I'm annoyed because what I think are glaring errors could have and should have been fixed. This is one of those movies than almost works and falls in the cracks. I mean this is taking the line about reaching for the stars and having what we want exceed our grasp a bit too literally.",6,3,8,5 January 2008
I Am Legend," dull
","It should be called I Am Boring.Will Smith is the last man 'alive' in a world where everyone has been turned into vampires by a cancer cure (or eaten by said vampires). Alone with his dog he is working valiantly for a cure....Well made, great looking (except the vampires which are clich√© bargain basement) and with a nice sense of dread, this is a really dull movie. Owing to the fact that we've been here before at least twice using the same source novel, not to mention George Romero's work and any other survivor scifi/horror film, odds are you've seen it all before at least nine or ten times. Jettisoning said source novel and relying more on the Charlton Heston version, Omega Man they've once again bowdlerized one of the classics of the horror genre. The title I Am Legend is a chilling end to the book, but here its been morphed into something else. Its not a bad movie, but it will induce sleep. I'm planning on buying a copy to put on for those nights I have insomnia.Wait for cable- I don't care how great and empty the city vistas look on the big screen you won't be awake to the end to see all of them",4,10,21,25 December 2007
Kick-Ass," Disappointing wish fulfillment fantasy
","Nerdy kid, for no real reason buys a wet suit and becomes a 'superhero'. Along the way he clashes with the mob, their mole hero Red Mist and a little girl and her father who are also 'superheroes'.I'm under whelmed by this tale of teen angst turned toward acceptable violence. Sure its grand wish fulfillment for anyone who wanted to be Spiderman and Batman, but at the same time it seems like it was constructed by the same people looking for said fulfillment. Its the story of a geeky kid who get to beat people up, gets the girl and live happily ever after. The problem it has a story that not only has plot holes you could drive a truck through, but it shifts tones almost moment by moment. Is it serious? is it a joke? What exactly am I suppose to feel? I don't know. I know some people have called it morally bankrupt and I can kind of see where thats coming from, with the tone being uncertain you don't know where the film stands.I'm not going to say much more other than to say I was extremely disappointed. Neither bad nor good, its kind of half baked.I'd wait for cable.",3,87,161,9 May 2010
Gran Torino," Good but I think the Oscar talk is a bit much
","Walt Kowalski's next door neighbor tries to steal his prize Gran Torino as an initiation for a gang. Walt Catches him and as pay back ends up taking the kid under his wing and teaching him things. However the gangs are still around and won't leave them alone.Clint Eastwood's second film in 2008 is a good little film about a life, getting older and how the people we 'hate' may not be as bad as we thought. I like it, though to be honest I don't quite understand the exceptional raves the film is getting. Well acted I'm not certain that Eastwood really is the right choice for the role of Kowalski, though I'm guessing that with out his starring role the film may not have been made. This is not to say its a bad film, its not, not even remotely, its just that the Oscar talk surrounding it seems to be out of place and due more to the director and star.The scenes between Walt and his young neighbor are quite good and they more than make up for the scenes between Walt and the young priest which seem to be there to bludgeon deeper meaning into the proceedings. As it its a deceptively simple film, the film becomes something much more complex in its ending which raises some interesting questions about what might have happened earlier (I can not explain that with out revealing the end of the film). I don't think the film needed the priest scenes to be as 'clear' since I think the film was complex enough as it is. (Its one of those films where I got to the end and said, Ah yes that was what he was getting at.Its a good film. its worth a look, just stay off my lawn.",7,4,9,6 January 2009
Hero," Masterpiece of Cinema
","Say what you will, this film is impressive on just about every level. The only minor flaw, and one thats just annoying me right now so I'm at 9 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10, is the pacing is just a tiny bit slow. But it will pass as I come to realize what a mistake that was.The plot is simple, a man named Nameless presents to the Emperor the weapons of his three greatest foes, he then recounts how he obtained them.
The visual style of this film puts most epics to shame, regardless of their origin. Since most of the film consists of stories the wire work and flashy action and vivid style only enhance what were are seeing and simply are the way things are.How do you describe this film?You don't you simply hold it out to people and tell them to see it- more so if they like Crouching Tiger since this does what that does but in new ways.Simply one of the greatest films ever made...even if I'm rating it right now as nine out of ten.SEE THIS.Though lets hope that Miramax doesn't completely ruin it now that they are calling it Jet Li's Hero and have trimmed three minutes from it.",9,0,1,3 May 2004
Shrek the Third," More clever than funny, this movie is almost devoid of laughs despite some game tries by the cast
","Shrek's father in-law dies and Shrek and Fiona are next in line.. Shrek, having been standing in for the king knows this is not the life for him so he goes off to find Artie, a kid also in line for the throne.If you've seen anything on this you've probably seen most of what passes for the jokes. This is not a funny movie, It is well plotted, but seemingly devoid of any laugh out loud humor. I sat there for the entire running time straight faced. I can admire the animation, I can admire the cleverness of 'the jokes' and I can admire the too many 'in' references, but I can't find it funny. (well thats not true, the Shrek baby stuff at the end is funny) If you want what I think is the perfect example of whats wrong with the film take the funeral for the king. The king has died and we hear Paul McCartney's live and Let Die (you know the James Bond theme song). Why? I have no clue...actually after what seems like an eternity fumbling around for a punch line we see a choir of frogs singing the song, Two minutes of screen time for a throw away joke about a short film that Paul McCartney produced that almost no one has seen in the US-Rupert and the Frog Song.The film is full of set ups to jokes that are so obscure that not even Jude would get them.(see what I'm getting at Thomas?) The humor is either obvious slapstick or these obscure duds. Clearly this what happens when you get too many animators and lock them in a room with a predetermined release date.Whats worse this seems like a (better) version of the dreadful Happily N'ever After so that those of us who suffered through that piece of horse hockey, get to watch a chunk of the plot reused (to better effect) here. Shrek three can't win for losing.Wait for Cable",4,1,2,27 May 2007
The Hurt Locker," Pieces of a film and a spoon fed point make this less then the sum of its parts
","Story of the last 38 days of a bomb disposal unit in Iraq before they are rotated back to the United States. The story follows the group as a new disposal expert joins the squad and upsets things with an almost devil may care attitude that upsets the two men who are suppose to watch over him while he defuses the bombs. The film is essentially a series of six or seven missions and some related activity that takes them closer and closer to the time they are suppose to go home and shows the changing dynamic between the men.Probable front runner for the Oscar has been consistently on the best of year lists of almost every film critic. Knowing this going into my seeing the film last evening I knew I was going in with a rather large chip on my shoulder concerning the film. I was expecting a major achievement. What I got was a good, solid film from Kathryn Bigelow, probably her best films, but not really one of the best films of the year.Forgive me I'm kind of at a loss as to what to say since the film didn't really strike me as anything that is all that special. It is essentially a series of set pieces over the course of just over a month. As small little pieces the film works very well since one is never really sure how things will play out. However after the second or so mission I suddenly realized that the film was rather formulaic in its construction with the same thing happening (with two variations) over and over again. The result for me was a film that held me for the pieces but never really amounted to much over all. (An aside, one thing that really bothered me about the film, and made it seem like nothing but pieces, is that there is no sense of any place beyond the immediate. We are at the bomb site or this one street, or this stretch of desert or this room. There is no sense of the world outside of that one spot for that one sequence. Military base? no its a room? There are no places only sets, like the film which is not a whole film but set pieces) Ultimately I don't get the film. I got a good way in and I realized that I had kind of stopped caring. It seems that the whole point of the film is as the film says at the beginning, that war is a drug and that some people need to have that to feel alive. But at the same time we're told that at the beginning and then basically we watch as that plays out with little variation to the end when the final coda reinforces that point of view. Perhaps if Bigelow had put the statement at the end of the film instead of the beginning I would have felt less spoon fed. In all honesty what strikes me about the film thematically is that film feels like it should be about something more than the one thing, but I'll be damned if I can figure out what it is.The cast is good, though any one going in with the intention of seeing the so called big stars, Guy Pearce, Evangeline Lilly, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, should be warned that most are little more than extended cameos and that its was wrong to list them over the title. The real star is Jeremy Renner at Sgt James, the bomb disposal expert.He's very good at being the hot shot loose canon who is extremely capable at what he does, even to the point of scaring his men.(And I think the anger at his tactics by some in the military is well founded since I think some of his moves would get him killed faster then one can say Jack Robinson) I'm trying to figure out how it fits into the rapidly growing Iraq/ Afghan war sub-genre. Certainly its one of the least clich√©d, we don't have the convoy ambushed in a narrow street scene anywhere in it, then again its scenes of barracks life could have been swapped out to any number of other films. Since it actually deals with soldiers in the field its one of a small number of films that actually stay in the field the entire time (most films tend to deal largely with the home front). I would say that it one of the better films (and its far away from the worst which is probably Brian DePalma's Redacted).Ultimately its a good, but not great film. Its more the sort of film that you'll like but walk away from scratching your head about.",6,5,10,31 December 2009
No Man's Land," Not quite Oscar worthy, but still very good.
","The story of the Bosnian conflict reduced to a small scale won the Oscar a few years back. I'm not sure that was because it was the best choice or because the film touch the current nerve in Hollywood.Basically its the story of three men fighting, literally in the trenches of Bosnia. Its a very funny and touching tale, that unfortunately is also clich√©d. Its not so much clich√©d in whats done, although there is some of that, rather its in the fact that the tried and true 'war is bad' cards are used to lessen the effect. Sending up even the media and the peacekeepers no one is spared in this obvious attack on a very wrong situation that has left too many people dead in the cross fire. Yes, the film is worth seeing, its a very good story, however had it not won the Oscar no one would have been talking about it three weeks after the ceremony.7 out of 10.

K-19: The Widowmaker," A confused mess
","The real story of what happened on a nuclear sub is as heartbreaking and glorious a tale that can be told. The tragedy of what happened is off set just a little by the ability of men to rise to save their friends and to honor those who led them. So it is sad that I have to report that the story of a Russian sub that has a nuclear reactor accident while at sea and has to deal with the danger inside the ship and th politics back home has been made into such a mess of a movie. Harrison Ford is seriously wrong in the role of the Captain of the ship. This is probably his worst screen performance. He is aided by a cast that allow their accents to drift like a rudderless ship on the ocean.
The real problem is the film making which makes the events so confused that I had to watch a program from the History Channel to get it all right in my head again. Things are so badly portrayed that there is almost no tension.The high point of the film is near the end of the film where the crew comes together years after the fact  to honor their fallen ship mates. Here is the kick in heart moment that you were waiting for for the previous two hours. Except for this moment and the promise of what might have been this movie really has no reason to exist.",3,4,9,6 March 2004
Slap Shot," Really funny
","Foul mouthed (this was one of the first films ever rated R for the language alone) comedy that has held up beautifully over the years. The story concerns The Charlestown Chiefs a minor league hockey team thats on the way out. The coach, played by Paul Newman doesn't want it to happen and so he takes matters into his own hands in order to assure that the team's attendance goes up and they have a shot of playing on. There's much more going, I've forgotten to mention the infamous Hansen brothers, three guys who a few short of a dozen but can fight and play hockey like nobody's business. A hysterical adult comedy, this is also one of the great sport films of all time. The film works, and has held up over the past 30 years, because the film is ultimately not so much about the jokes or the hockey, but about the characters and for the most part you'll like everyone of them. This is a wonderful movie. Just keep it away from the kids if you don't want them to pick up some very colorful language.",9,5,6,29 September 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Much better than the first film, this film suffers by being way way too long
","What ever I say won't make a difference- You're either in love with this whole Twilight nonsense or you're not.I'm not and after disliking the first film was shocked to be dragged kicking and screaming to the second film. In a weird way I kind of liked it.The plot has Edward leaving Bela who is than watched over by Jacob who's (possible spoiler here) a werewolf.First off you kind of need the first film to set up Bela and Edward's relationship (maybe not since I never understood what she saw in Edward.) Here there is no build up just the two kids with crazy lust for each other with no explanation. It just is.Next you have to understand that this is very over long soap opera that kind of looks like a soft core film where everyone keeps their clothes on (except the guys with six pack abs). Its pure teen angst drawn out to a silly degree. I was giggling through a chunk of this...its so silly... except if you're in its target audience in which case its note perfect.Personally I think if there was shorter this would be better. The real problem here is not a heck of a lot happens. Its lots of angst and maybe romance with a couple of plot bits thrown in for later use. There's enough plot for half a film but twice the require running time. I may have liked it but I kept checking my watch and reaching for the remote (which wasn't there because I was in the movies).I need to add a couple of things, first off some of the performances are wither wooden or so over the top as to be ridiculous. Michael Sheen should be ashamed. Secondly I need to ask why is Edward and the other male vampires considered sexy? I could understand it if they didn't have the make up on but they mostly looked under fed, pasty faced and silly.That said this is better than the first one, I just wish I had seen this on TV where I could have zipped through the silly parts.",6,0,7,28 November 2009
The Illusionist," A curl up by the fire 'I'm going to tell you a really good story' sort of a movie
","Nothing is what it seems.Mostly.Clearly one of the most special movies of the year, here is a movie that proves Edward Norton and Paul Giammatti are not as over rated as some poor recent choices made it seem (What a joy it is to see them spar).This is the story of Eisenheim the magician who comes to Vienna to do magic and falls in love with a woman above his station. Thats the party line and here I'm willing to tow it since to do otherwise would involve lengthy explanations that would tell you too much before hand.Absolutely one of the best looking, best acted, best made movies of the year. Its a wonderful movie that will thrill your sense of wonder. Its like curling up with a good book on a dark night before a roaring fire. Its a wonderful drama with romance and laughter and danger and magic, both of the how do they do that sort and the type that tickles your heart.This is one to see. Absolutely.",8,2,3,5 September 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Better than the first film this is still a disappointment
","While Sue and Reed prepare for their wedding, strange phenomena begin to happen all around the world. The strange happenings are the work of 'the Silver Surfer', herald of Galactus who is coming to devour our planet. Its up to the Fantastic Four to stop the Surfer and Galactus before the earth is destroyed.I actually liked this film. It has more of the banter that made the comic fun to read, the action set pieces are cool and there is charm to it that manages to lift it all out of recent rash of dour comic films. I don't love the film as a whole but I do like the pieces very much.The problems for me come from two places. First the film is too short. The story cries out for a more epic telling with a better sense of place, but that isn't here. Sure the plot takes the characters around the world but there is very little sense of them ever being out of a back lot. Other than the London and New York scenes the film could have been filmed anywhere and so feels cheap or like a bumped up TV movie.The other problem is that I don't know how non comic fans are going to react. There seems to be an odd short hand which assumes that you know the comic. This is particularly true with the character development for the Surfer. His character is in many ways very close to the comic book one, except that you wouldn't know that unless you read the comic. He says almost nothing and is more or less just a silent sentinel. While this was fine for those who know the comic, my Dad and others seeing this with me were left a bit perplexed as to why the character went on to comic super stardom.Its not worth getting into the changes from the comic, Galactus in particular, since the movie seems intent on carving out its own niche.Worth seeing, though I would be hard pressed to say its worth 10 bucks a head (bargain matin√©e or DVD anyone?).",6,5,11,17 June 2007
Transformers," Trash- you probably won't believe me but this is pretty pictures and nothing else
","What can I say? Okay me me rephrase that, what can I say nice? The actors aren't bad. The CGI looks okay...in the trailer.Soulless unfunny big screen live action disaster based on the cartoon series. Michael Bay rapes the American public once again.This is awful.How bad? My dad fell asleep and I kept moaning this is awful this is awful.I think one reviewer claimed something about this being a sign of the Apocalypse. I believe him. This is proof that most people want form over content and bread and circus' over anything meaningful.The plot is something like the Decepticons trying to find a cosmic cube or spark or something so they can rule the world. The Autobots- who mostly don't show up until an hour in are also trying to find it but to protect man kind. I don't know, I don't care.Don't get me wrong this is well made trash. It looks good, even if the CGI is never fully integrated into the film. Yet again we have these cool looking effects that seem unconnected with the people. Why are effects getting worse and worse? 200 million dollars and you can tell that the transformers are not with the people.The problems mostly lie in the script. First off the movie is wildly silly, even the parts that are not suppose to be 'funny'. What can I say its so over the top as to be laughable. The comedy is dumb in a TV sitcom sort of way.Then again this is coming from a TV cartoon so it makes perfect sense. Worse a good many of the actors mug and play their roles for laughs for much of the early parts of the film so that when it comes time to be serious you don't believe them. There is no tension because you don't believe there is any real danger...or anything that is connected to reality. I never once believed this was real-or possible. No one acted nor did the plot spin out in anything other than the sort of reality found on second rate TV shows or movies.I think the choices to play to the fans and keep things close to the TV show-using some of the voices hurt the believability of much of the film. Sure the scorpion thing looks cool and a few others seem plausible, but Optimus Prime just looks really stupid when placed in the real world.and yet its well made. On some technical level this is a 'good' movie. Not good enough to recommend it...but good on some scale of proficiency.I'm at a loss for words-really.What a waste this is. Its just an incredibly stupid movie.",3,11,24,26 August 2007
Children of Men," Not one of the best films
","An explanation of why I don't think this is a great a film as some have said: Unremarkable film for people who don't have much imagination. Its well made and well acted but the script is not very good, either they explain too much or not enough and almost everything is geared to driving the plot. I felt like I was being force fed the story, which didn't seem to spin out organically.Characters exist purely to serve the plot with the sole exception of Michael Caine who is the only one with a real character. There is a sense of place, but also the sense that somewhere just off the screen there is something else , the film crew (in Bladerunner we got a sense of a bigger world- the space stations of the replicants exists- here I'd be hard pressed to wonder if anything other than England does). Indeed much of the film's world makes no sense, scene after scene I felt was staged in the backgrounds and not real. You have scenes where everything is chaos and others where there is some form of order, but it sees to be two separate films. Also in a world of declining population there seems to be way way too many cops.The best 'new world' film exist and don't have to explain things to you.In the best you learn stuff 'accidentally' on the way.In say Reign of Fire the world's rules are given to you in ways that are natural, as part of conversations, glimpses at headlines. In the worst they either explain too much or so little that nothing makes sense. Here we get endless droning from the TV and on on the signs. But ts almost too much information that only rehashes what we already know. There are these statements from the terrorists when Julianne Moore kidnaps Clive Owen that are meaningless dramatically since Owen would know it already, but which are fed in to inform us. We shouldn't be told in essentially declarative statements about things. Look at Bladerunner, we're dropped in this world and we don't get an explanation of anything, the world is. Owens story is potentially a prequel to Dekers so its odd that the world here is not as complete.And the plot goes on and on and on with out any real character development. There are few if any real characters, mostly its just odd people wandering in and out with no real sense of who these people are.It would be okay if there was something for them to do, but there isn't, they just move the plot along. What is it between Julianne Moore and Owen? Who are these other people? I don't know. there are huge streams of back story that are hinted at but never touched, which can be gotten away with if you have characters and not cut outs. It would also help if you had a writer who wasn't interested in just moving the plot, who could with a line say volumes, thats not the case. The words are constructed to move things along not build character and situations.I know part of the problem is changes from the book (which I haven't read) Julianne Moore's character is actually two characters combined, and there are other changes that probably didn't help.Again its not bad, its just not one of the best films of the year, technically maybe, and certainly Michael Caine should be up for an Oscar, but the story as told on screen doesn't amount to much.",5,34,59,16 September 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A true story of not so long ago retold as a warning for today
","The story (partial) of Edward R Murrow's attack on Joseph McCarthy.A great film on pretty much every level this film is a good retelling of of the story of how a few people armed with facts brought down a Senator. The acting, the music, the look of the film are all top notch. This is a story that many people don't know any more and its a shame.If the film missteps its in failing to give a historical context for the story being told. While I did not live through the time covered I was taught the history surrounding it, and knowing it gave the story a greater resonance for me. The story is also much greater and less straight forward than what we see on screen. I am also very aware that the purpose of this film is not entirely historic. This is a film with an agenda, and while I do agree with the agenda, I found myself distracted by it.Still this is a great film. 7.5 out of 10",7,1,2,5 February 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Frustrating- Well made movie with nothing in the center
","Picking up at the end of the first movie this film tops whats gone before, but at it heart is a decidedly empty center.The plot begins with the evil corporation going back into the Hive complex that was the setting of the first film. They are unprepared for what they find and are almost instantly over run by the walking dead. The dead spill out into the city above and it becomes a fight for survival.This film moves better than the first film. Certainly the handling of the dead and the mutants is infinitely better. The action scenes are first rate, the performances are very good, in fact this film has everything to be considered 'Dawn of the Dead 2' except a real plot.Thats the rub, for the first half hour there is no real plot only introductions of characters. The second half hour the plot finally kicks in, but by that time I was a bit too distanced from it to care. Essentially the plot has to do with this band of people trying to get out of the city by rescuing the daughter of one of the scientists responsible for the whole mess. The corporation behind it all has their own plans and it becomes a three way battle, good guys, corporation and monsters. If only there had been more to the script, then we'd be talking classic here.I don't know. I gave the film a 6 out of 10, but its probably better than that, I'm just awash in serious disappointment because whats good is so good, that I wanted more behind it.Try it and decide for yourself.",6,6,14,12 September 2004
Grave of the Fireflies," Depressing, but a must see
","One of the great animated films of all time Grave of Fireflies tells the story of a couple of kids as the try to survive in war time Japan. What happens to them should be seen by anyone thinking of starting a war since it tells very graphically what happens to those often forgotten, the children.Like its companion piece, Barefoot Gen, which tells the story of survivors of atomic bombing and the horrors that were experienced by those unlucky enough not to have been killed out right, this film proves that war is hell for everyone, especially the children.Its very hard to send anyone out to see this unhappy little film (The previously mentioned Barefoot Gen spawned sequels, this has not) but at the same time you owe it to yourself to experience, however distantly what sort of monster we unleash upon the world every time we go to war. It helps that however depressing this is, its also a damn good and incredibly compelling story.9 out of 10",9,165,193,6 July 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Starts slow, ends big
","As I watched the start of this film I was pained because I thought I was going to be doomed to sit through two and a half hours of painful exploitation rip offs done in a 'gee whiz look at me' style. Then some where about 45 minutes in this movie started to spark to life and it became a thrill ride to the blood soaked ending.Far from a great film, this film is certainly a very guilty pleasure. Quentin Tarantino knows his schlock fodder enough to copy it down to its awful technical nature. This film gets so many of the grade Z movie styles right I became certain that Tarantino never went to school in his life, we must have been separated at birth.If you like action, if you like exploitation, if you like movies, see this movie, its kick ass and lots of fun.8 out of 10",8,0,3,12 August 2004
Saw II," Jigsaw is back and so is the nastiness in a not very good sequel
","Jigsaw, the crazed killer from the first Saw is back. Here he's locked up a group of people and told them they have two hours to get out of the house before the nerve gas he's pumping in will kill them. Meanwhile a cop has captured the killer and learns that one of the people trapped in the house is his son.As illogical and mean the first film was it had a certain something that made you want to watch to the end. You had real characters and real twists that kept you glued to your seat. Unfortunately here only the meanness and illogic remains.I need more than just the prospect of nasty things happening to make a movie. Saw 2's horror does not arise from anything other than waiting to see what the next gory event is going to be. Its a step up and over from the slasher films of the early 1980's where you were more interested in how people died than who the characters were. Here the interest is how are the elaborate traps going to kill the next victim. Yes it creates tension, but on some level it becomes nothing more than catalog of mans cruelty to man.Saw 2 also has other problems that I can not get past (Spoilers a head) how does Jigsaw have the time to build these huge death traps? This is especially curious owing to his condition. I had the same question about the first film but the plot moved along at such a clip I didn't have time to think. Here there is time and it made me crazy. How does Jigsaw know so much? He knows so much about everyone and he has access to files and info that he would have no reasonable way of getting. Again how does he have the time and strength to gather all of this material? I won't go into the behavior of the cops, the means of his rounding up all of the victims. Obviously you can't think about these things or the film will collapse.I can't really recommend this film, since while it is well made, its little more than a collection of nasty deaths and cruel acts with the pretense of being something else.",3,3,6,12 November 2005
Ip Man," Great action bio from Donnie Yen and company
","Donnie Yen stars as the Ip Man. A well off man who spent his life studying martial arts and perfecting his technique to the point he was unbeatable. Often sparring with the heads of the local dojos behind closed doors he tried to learn as much as he could. Covering a brief period before the Japanese invasion of China in the first third of the film, the majority of the film deals with what happened after the invasion and how the man who 'can't do anything' found he could.I have no idea how much of this is gospel truth, but whats on screen is very good. The film has great performance by Yen as the Ip Man, who conveys a great deal of our hero's humanity and sense of honor in the non-action scenes and really letting loose in the action sequences. Yen's quiet demeanor nicely covers his unstoppable ability. Even having seen Yen in numerous other films, I still found his battles utterly amazing (Thank you Sammo Hung). If you love action you really need to see this.I really liked this film. If there is a problem with the film I found some of the Japanese sequences a tad clich√© (Bad Japanese monsters). Its not bad, but in a film that seems to strive to be more than a typical martial arts film, I found it kind of disappointing.Then again when the end came I was moved, so I guess it doesn't matter.If you want to see a really good action bio, see this film.7.5 out of 10.(I may change the rating down the road when I find a DVD that translates the on screen text (there's a good deal of it) which passed before my eyes only in Chinese.)",8,4,6,15 January 2009
Paranormal Activity," Creepy, will probably be more so in a dark house. Its a good film but not 'the scariest film ever made' as some have dubbed it
","There are spoilers below) Video Footage shot by a couple who are being bothered by a spirit or entity of some sort.The wife has had experiences going back to the time she was 8. the husband thinks its kind of a lark, but decides to film their lives in the hopes of turning up some clue to what is going on. Even in desperation they bring in one expert who says that the entity is beyond his ability and recommends that they call some one he knows. The husband doesn't think they need to...which in this case is best filed under famous last words.This is another in the growing number of films that are supposed to be found footage of an event.Some of the films work and some don't depending upon the ability of filmmakers to mirror real home video footage.The film is simply what the camera sees so a great deal happens off screen so what you end up is a film that is basically all suggestion. Some filmmakers can do it and many can't. Here I think they have it down pretty good with the result its being billed as one of the scariest movies ever made, I don't think thats the case. I do think this is going to have a long life once it hits home video where teens will sit around in their houses and watch and freak themselves out. To me it's better than Blair Witch, but probably not as good as the best parts of Cloverfield. Certainly it hangs together better than either of those two films. The film will make you feel uneasy. It may make you jump. I don't know if it will scare you in the way the 'scariest film ever made ' should.Its a good film and if you want to leave it there and see the film, stop reading now. If you want to know why I don't think its a great film keep reading.(Spoilers ahead) For me the film is good instead of great for a couple of reasons. First and foremost the film goes on way too long. Several sequences, while building character, go on way too long. There was more than once when I was bored. Sue me I have a limited ability to stand home movies, even my own, and this is sometimes really dull. I also have problems with several things that happen. Just once I'd like once someone not to do the one thing they are told not to do. The husband didn't have to pull out the Ouiji board. Is it me or doesn't it seem odd that when the couple is woken up by events, they never turn on the light? The grab the camera, but they don't turn on the house lights. I also am not too happy with the rapid progression toward the end.The man who comes to help is in and out so fast its not scary but silly, why didn't they all go outside and talk?. Lastly has to do with the camera's ability to record...there has to be a limit to how much it can record.(I can't say more than that). The visual effects are an uneven mix of good and bad. I'm not sure why the real special effects, the shadows, the door, the being pulled out of bed are all really well done, but things like the Ouiji board bursting into flames or the exorcism on line are laughably bad.Its jarring and breaks the spell.(Spoilers End) Its a good enough film to recommend. I'm pretty sure its going to give you some sort of rise, though how big will probably be determined by how and where you see this- if you do watch this at home make sure to leave the lights on.",7,4,7,24 October 2009
World Trade Center," From hate - Hope
","'911 showed us what human beings were capable of, certainly the evil, but also the good....' paraphrase of Nicholas Cage toward the end of World Trade Center Oliver Stone puts you into Manhattan on the day the towers fell and shows you the story of a couple of Port Authority Policemen who were trapped in the rubble and what happened to them and their families.Some people love it some people hate it. I really like it.Stone manages to convey what it was like in New York and what it was like for the cops and firemen down at ground zero. These are not macho men but regular guys simply doing what had to be done.Every act of heroism is tinged with 'I don't want to be here' which makes it even more touching.The film is essentially split in two, the people at ground zero and the people back home waiting for word. Its an odd split and its the films biggest weakness. I understand that by showing the families Stone makes the story bigger than just some guys trapped, but at the same time the split makes the film remain a Hollywood film instead of something greater. Its not bad, its just that the story down in the rubble does not come across as clich√© tinged.Technically this film is amazing. It looks and sounds good. The shots of Manhattan and around ground zero are frighteningly perfect. Yes I know a portion of the film was shot in NYC but much was shot elsewhere. Having wandered around the streets down there I can guess which shot is which street and the sense of it all being real comes not from having seen photos but rather from seeing the real places.The best part of this film is that its about hope and the goodness of people. The world is shaken and people attempt to fix it. As Cage says at the end its showed us what people are capable of...this film is a celebration of the good.",8,2,7,20 August 2006
Black Hawk Down," As a look at men in modern battle this is very good. As a depiction of the actual event its fair
","Prompted by listening to the book on CD going to and from work I finally sat down and watched Ridley Scott's film of the day everything went wrong in Mogadishu Somalia.The plan was to go in, secure a building where some of a wanted warlord's men were meeting and then get out. From the minute the soldiers started to lad things went wrong when one soldier falls from a helicopter. Complicating matters even more is the fact that the Somali's know how to take out the helicopters and soon one of the Blackhawks goes down. This is followed by a second helicopter. With men and machines scattered all over the city it becomes a desperate race to get the soldiers out before they are cut to ribbons by what seems like every person in the city.I'm of mixed emotions about the film. Certainly as a representation of urban guerrilla war this is a kick in the pants. You are there in the thick of chaos as choppers go down and everyman is fighting desperately for cover. As a war film the film is amazing and its frightening since where do you hide when everyone it seems is out to get you? The problem for me is that the film is often not very clear. The battle is not in context of history. Granted that this is not always needed or desired, and I understand the 'why' of it all isn't the point of the film, but without it the battle just seems to be a bunch of guys going in to a place they don't belong and getting in over their head. While that is certainly part of the story its also not entirely true. I think the problem is that the opening bits of the film which gives the film its place and time while explaining what things are like in Somalia promises more background then we get and perhaps it would have been a better film if we had just skipped all of that and just went into battle.We also get lost as to who is who. Even with the modification of names on helmets I found it tough to tell who was who and which story thread I was following. Yes the casting of Eric Bana (who is excellent and actually gives a real performance), Josh Harnett, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor and a few others help to make things easier to follow but for the most part much of the film was people in uniform shooting at people out of uniform.Okay yes, I had just heard the book which neatly lays everything out, but at the same time knowing what I know, I was still confused (and not because what I knew conflicted by what I saw).To be honest once I divorced the film from any sort of depiction of actual events and took it to be just a story of men under fire I quite enjoyed it. Is it the be all and end all? No. its a good story told in an action packed manner.Worth a shot Personally I'd like to see another version of the story which manages to tell the larger story as well since there are too many stories that weren't covered or left hanging..",6,0,1,25 July 2008
Into the Wild," Beautiful marriage of image and music is greatly lessened by central character who is impossible to admire (SPOILERS)
","(SPOILER ALERT:I will discuss the end of the film so if you don't want to know, don't read on.) Yesterday I watched Sean Penn's film of INTO THE WILD. This is the story of a college grad named Chris McCandless, who turned his back on civilization and wandered off into the wilds of Alaska. Its based on a book by Jonathan Krakauer who wrote Into Thin Air about a climb up Everest that went all wrong.I waited a while before posting this because I had to think about it. There is a great deal to love and a central character who was very hard to.This is a beautiful movie. The marriage of image with the exceptional score is truly amazing.I loved watching the sound and image dance across my TV screen. The problem for me is that once the characters began to talk I couldn't careless. For what ever reason I couldn't connect to McCandless at all. He sounded like a spoiled brat. I don't know if its because McCandless was a twit or because Sean Penn has chosen to portray him as an epic hero for individualism. For me there was nothing he did or said that deserved a two and a half hour movie other than living a life that we could project a sense of longing and lost utopia on to. Clearly it connects with some part of ourselves that connect to Thoreau's Walden the great tale of self reliance (and which apparently is a lie since Thoreau went home every night for a good meal and a warm bed). It was clear to me that he was heading for trouble, and even if I hadn't known how it all came out I probably could have guessed.Technically I think this is probably one of the best films of last year, but emotionally I don't. I know a good number of people are in love with the film and it's just outside the IMDb top 100, but I'm lost as to why. For me its a beautifully told film that is in its way close to death porn, where the death of the hero somehow makes everything transcendent- or rather is changed into something transcendent so that someone's life has meaning, instead of being a cold lonely painful death all alone somewhere in the wild. For me there was no transcendence only sadness at a life lost.",4,5,14,30 March 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," I can't be objective
","I'm at a loss here to be objective about this movie set in a persons mind simply because as good as it is, I can't get past reality. It begins on a railway platform with commuters waiting to go to work on Valentines Day 2004, which would be nice, except it was a Saturday. While due to circumstances of the plot this could be okay, the problem is that the rest of the film was set in 'real' places that I know, none of which seemed like the real place. I kept jumping out of the film despite excellent performances, to quibble about the reality of the film. That aside it wasn't a bad movie but more three stars rather than the four that most people are giving it.",6,0,2,5 April 2004
Taken," Liam Neeson becomes an action hero
","Luc Besson produces a slam bang action thriller starring Liam Neeson.Neeson is a divorced dad who adores his daughter, but can't provide for her like her new step dad since his security gig doesn't pay all that well. When his daughter goes to France things take a turn for the worst as she ends up kidnapped. This is bad news for the guys who took her since Neeson was once an agent over seas and he doesn't play nice.Pure popcorn movie is a bit slow to start but once Neeson's daughter goes missing the film begins firing on all cylinders and its becomes really clear that Neeson has a future playing bad ass action heroes. Its a violent take no prisoners ride as Neeson single mindedly goes after his daughter and no one who gets in his way is safe. No one. This means its mean and nasty with a torture scene that well, I didn't know Liam had it in him. I really liked this film a great deal. It just winds it self up and goes like a rocket. If the film has any flaws its that the movie sometimes moves on to the next thing a little too abruptly. Not that I truly mind, but its the difference between being a seven out of ten and an eight.If you like action movies see this film.",7,3,7,10 August 2008
This Is Spinal Tap," What once was fresh is now clich√©
","I remember seeing this on its original release and was very amused by it all. Here was a very funny low budget comedy that was actually funnier the more you knew. Unfortunately time has not been kind to Spinal Tap. While its importance in the history of film and culture can not be under estimated, the past 20 odd years have made it a clich√©. Everyone has ripped it off or referenced it including all of those involved in it. Thats fine, however it makes sitting through it rather difficult since you've seen most of the jokes before, even if you haven't seen the movie before. I suppose there is some consolation that this was the seed from which a thousand mockumentaries and two million jokes sprung, but when you want to see a funny movie it kind of takes the laughter out of the evening.",5,9,27,11 February 2005
Avatar," Good, but far from the next step in entertainment since it borrows so much from what has gone before
","Lord I miss the Last Air bender....James Cameron's half a BILLION dollar film (figure in the promotion its around that figure) is a huge animated film masquerading as a live action feature film. Its, like most of Cameron's super productions, a self serving over hyped monstrosity that is neither as good as he thinks it is or as bad as we hoped it would be.Billed as the next step in entertainment I'm left wondering what makes the film different then anything thats gone before other than the motion capture characters. The Next step? only if you go to the movie on rare occasions and never read fantasy or Science Fiction. Ursula Le Guin, Piers Anthony, EE Doc Smith and everyone else working in genre has been there before. Is it really worth the effort to count down the long list of films this borrows from Quigley Down Under to A Man Called Horse to the Matrix to Aliens to Dances with Wolves to anything I've read people have compared it to. Its a plot as well worn as they come. Even the music is lifted from tribal chants to Star Trek The Motion Picture to anything with soaring choral music. Its's also clear Wayne Barlowe designed the look of the creatures since they seem similar to numerous creatures he's painted over the years.(Had they wanted to be radical they would have had Barlowe go off the board) Okay I could go on ripping the film to shreds but lets try and take it on its own terms.Lets say it, the film is neither original nor ground breaking. Its an over hyped film that is much too in love itself. It is painfully overlong at seventeen...er almost three hours.The plot has a cripple ex-marine taking his twin brothers place as an avatar pilot on a distant world. He is assigned to infiltrate the locals and find out as much as he can. he does so and in the process falls in love with the people and one girl in particular. He then has to fight with his new people to save them and their way of life.On the most basic of levels the plot is fine but on a detailed level there are lots of plot holes and plot questions. Thankfully Cameron in his wonderful junior high school way has set up outs for many things that don't make sense like how will the good guys win when they have bows and arrows and the humans have explosives and bullets.( Cameron is not a stupid man as anyone who has heard him talk or seen his documentaries can attest, however his story construction has always been stunted and simplistic at best) How the simplicity will survive in two planned sequels is beyond me.There are lots of long 'look isn't this great' sequences which are meant to show off. On the plus side they look good in 2D on the down side the film slows way down as a result.The performances are fine but out side of the main two characters everyone is cardboard. Its fine because they aren't given much to really do but at the same time they all blur together.The action scenes are good but not great with many of the oh cool sequences in the TV commercials. Also some sequences seem stretched out for no good reason with lots of slow motion to make everything look 'Cool'.In all honesty had this film lost an hour it would have been a much better film, but at two hours forty something minutes this film is a soul killer. My Dad and I just looked at each other at about the half way point an wondered how much longer this had to go and we both groaned when we realized it was almost it was eighty something minutes.Its not a bad film. Its worth seeing, but I don't know that I needed to see it on a big screen, and while I didn't see it in 3D I don't think I really would have liked it more if I had. Personally I think you can wait for DVD or cable.(A friend of a a friend who didn't like the film said that he now understands how people who don't get Star Wars feel. Frankly there is a difference. Love of Star Wars comes from a real place, a place that wasn't mass media created. All of the hype to Avatar is PR created hype put together to sell tickets. Star Wars is a film that is about characters moving in a simplistic story where things just are, the worlds of Luke Skywalker were not pushed in our faces until the marketing machines took over with Return of the Jedi and by that time the characters and the story had taken hold because they were good. Avatar is a simple story pumped up to sell tickets and sell toys.Its had the marketing machine from the first moment.. Star Wars has been out for almost 33 years, spawned 6 films, numerous novels, comics and TV shows. Avatar has been out a week and has spawned little more than some mixed box office and a budget debt bigger than many countries GNP. I'll wait 33 Years before I assess how successful Avatar is.) 6 out of 10",6,32,63,26 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Once the curse is cast and the race to break it happens this is a great little film
","Bank loan officer is cursed by an old woman she turns down for a loan and must find away to break the curse before she is dragged to hell.Good horror film is a solid little B movie. Scary and creepy, but not too scary and creepy this is a throw back to the horror films of the 1950's and 60's with a huge nod to the classic Curse of the Demon. Many people I know went absolutely crazy for this film when it came out in theaters and were shocked when it didn't make a ton of money. I delayed seeing it for a long time because I didn't want their opinion to color my feelings for the film. I like the film once it gets going. Once our heroine is cursed I think the film really works (though I think something towards the end is a bit of a cop out). The trouble for me was getting through the first third or so of the film. For me it was a long tough slog made difficult by several unlikeable characters. (I'm also not a fan of the old woman who places the curse since its clear from frame one she, and her family are just totally evil),]. However once its all moving I laughed I cried I jumped out of my seat.One of the better recent horror films, certainly one one of the best by a major director, this is worth a look.

Grindhouse," A trip to the grind house of old with great trailers, a fun splatter flick are ruined by painfully dull 'car chase' movie thats mostly talk
","Two movies in the style of the old grind house double features, complete with trailers.The trailers are great, but are too short to spoil with discussion. They are simply a great deal of fun.The first film is Planet Terror. This is the story of a zombie like take over of the the world due to a chemical weapon. Every zombie clich√É¬© you've ever seen here is played out with a bigger budget and higher body count. Its a bloody film thats a great deal of fun. If there is any problem with the film its that its intentionally nonsensical. To be certain films of this type often left logic and reason to blow in the wind, but even so you had a sense that things would have made sense if they had the money, or a better script, or something. Here the film jumps around and I got the feeling that they were doing it simply to replicate the feel of the old films and not out of necessity. On a scale of one to ten the film is a seven- get a bucket of popcorn, a root beer and enjoy.The second film is Death Proof. Easily one of the worst films of this year, and then some. This is a talky bore. The first half of the film has a bunch of girls and guys hanging out in a bar drinking and shooting the breeze. Nothing happens much other than the girls run into Stuntman Mike played by Kurt Russell. When they leave some 50 minutes into the film Stuntman Mike does what he does, which is kill the women. The film then shifts gears and we meet a new group of girls who talk for a while before Mike shows up. However these girls aren't like the first and they decide to battle the madman. Painful Absolutely painful. As good as the stunts and crashes are, the dialog is bad. The normally sharp Quentin Tarantio pacing is non existent. Who made this really? This is an exploitation film of the worst sort- it rips you off. This is also the sort of movie that grind house audiences might have demanded to be removed simply because there simply isn't enough action. I hate this film. On a scale of one to ten, a one, for some great stunts. (I can not believe that there is a longer cut of this film. Clearly we know what movie is going to be played eternally in hell when we die)Leave when Death Proof starts and you'll have a great time at the movies.",4,18,34,8 April 2007
The Artist," good but wildly over praised
","Sue me I'm not in love with the film.Yes it's funny. yes it has some charming moments, but I can not for the life of me understand how this is the front runner for this years Oscars.The plot of the film has a silent movie star meeting an extra at a premiere. Meeting again the next day on a set they are both smitten, but he's married. As her star rises, his begins to fall since he won't move from silents to sound films. However their lives remain intertwined....I laughed, a had a tear or two but I wasn't blown away. For me the film isn't all the critics have said. It's not so much a loving homage to American silent films, its more a homage to some one's idea of silent films if they really haven't seen them. The pastiche's mostly fall flat feeling more like recreations of recreations (The only silent film that feels like a real silent film is the material they stole from Fairbank's version of Zorro). There are other problems with the historical things in the film, but they are not important since this is after all just a comedy.To be honest the real problem is the film's short changes too much. Characters, such as our hero's wife are more cardboard than real. There is also the casting of people like Ed Lauter and Malcolm McDowell in roles that give them billing, but in reality are glorified walk ons (was stuff cut?) The plot also leaps through time not building to anything simply moving from moment to moment hoping that we in the audience will fill in all that isn't said.Don't get me wrong I don't hate the film, I just don't think it's the nearly the best of anything of the year.Worth a look but don't feel the need to fight the crowds.",4,98,162,7 December 2011
Up," Some thoughts on why I think this is a near perfect film but one I like but didn't love
","The newest Pixar movie is infuriatingly near perfect. Don't get me wrong, its a good movie, but its one of those movies where if you can work out the perfect way the story should go- thats what you'll see. The opening montage of the life of Ed Asner's character with his wife is as damn near a perfect arc of a life as you'll likely to see...and the tears come exactly on cue. through much of the film when you see certain visual images or verbal references, you realize that you'll see them later on. Its a perfectly constructed film, possibly the most perfectly constructed film that Pixar's made, but at the same time it's the most artificial. Pete Docter has fashioned the most perfect of animated, nay, of any films from all of the best stuff in the world and he forgot one key thing, heart and emotion, real heart and deep emotion. Yes I was moved and yes I was carried along, but at the same time I didn't feel completely part of it. I didn't really feel the real emotion. I didn't feel the emotional connection of Wall-e and Eva, I didn't feel the joy of Peter O'Toole's food critic at the end of Ratatouille. the 'Claw is our Master' in Toy Story is still better then 'look a squirrel'. I know I've complained about almost every Pixar feature, but even in the bitching there was real emotion and not manipulated emotion.I'm annoyed, I wanted to cry at the end, I didn't.It is one of the best of the Pixar movies, but I liked it I didn't love it.(And yes while the casting of Christopher Plummer is choice, they shouldn't have made him look like Kirk Douglas unless they were going to use Douglas. I know Douglas has medical problems but, damn it would have been nice to hear him leaping into action.) (and perhaps the one real flaw...too many dogs)",7,4,12,6 June 2009
Stalingrad," The other side
","Despite being a bit too clean and Hollywood-esque this is a brutal film that kicks you in the head and the heart. From the first confused attack to the final fade out in the snow this is a film that works wonderfully as a companion piece to Enemy at the Gate, seeing Stalingrad from the other side.",8,2,3,6 February 2004
National Treasure," Good Popcorn Movie
","Completely unbelievable but fun romp around the world looking for treasure...it won't win any awards but its a good two hours at the movies.The plot to trying to find a lost treasure a clue to which is on the back of the Declaration of Independence is so beyond belief that its best to simply begin by throwing up your hands and accepting it for what it is. Certainly the cast has thrown reality to the wind and appears to be having a grand time.My only complaint, and its what keeps me from saying you you should see this in a theater instead of renting it, is that the pacing is off. It needs a zipper pace to get us from A to B. Certainly it moves well, but there were times when I just wanted to to move a bit faster. Its a minor fault, but one that prevented me from really loving this.7 out of 10. Definitely worth seeing, preferably for less than what they charge for a full price movie admission these days.",7,80,132,21 November 2004
How to Train Your Dragon," Good but just missed for me
","Boy wants to go off and fight dragons but he generally causes more harm then good with his inventions. He randomly fires off one and the next day finds he's downed a dragon. While his dad and the other vikings head off to kill the dragons the boy and the dragon he caught bond opening the way for human dragon friendship.Why don't I like this better? Its got great characters, great writing, great sequences, wonderful animation....and yet it just missed for me.Was it the fact that the plot is too waiver thin that you can mostly fill in the blanks? Maybe partly, but then again it constantly surprises you.Was it the wildly uneven character design that runs from realistic to Looney Tunes? Maybe. I knew the silly faces were coming from the trailers but when you finally see them its kind of a let down.Mostly I think its the pacing which is a bit lax, thanks in part to too many beautiful flying sequences. The flying stuff is great, but there is almost too much of it. And several other sequences seem to go on too long. The sequences, say the training sequences, are great but they go on and on.Its a solid movie, but where the whole thing should have been great to match the bits, the whole is just good.I will give the film points for being ballsy enough to have the finale cost our characters something.",6,4,12,5 June 2010
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick loses his way
","Stanley Kubrick's final film plays slightly better this second full time through, but at the same time its too frigging long.The plot of the movie that never ends (made in a shoot that never ended) is about a rich doctor who is haunted by a story his wife tells him of infidelity. This leads him on an odd odyssey that shakes up his world even further.When I saw this in the theaters on the night it opened I was so bored by it I left after the much over rated sex scenes at the masked ball. I made one later attempt at seeing it when it came out on home video and got all the way through it. Other visits with the film have come on cable where I criss crossed through the films recesses in odd clips. Recently I had a long discussion with a friend who loves the film and figured I'd try it again. To be certain his remarks, probably the most intelligent I've ever heard concerning the film, made me hopeful that I had missed something. I don't think so.The film concerns obsession and what a perceived infidelity will and can do to a man or woman. Cruise's dark journey all hinges on the fact that he can't get what his wife tells him out of his mind. Seeing it again for the first time in almost ten years I see little things that I probably missed the first time out. There is real power in the early scenes of Cruise and Kidman together and even apart as Kidman's unhappiness leads to flirtations and lustful thoughts that upset Cruise's sense of the world. I don't think that the whole masked cabal thing works, even on an allegorical level since the giant set piece of people having sex and performing rites seems to have been pulled in from a Hammer horror film. Whats even more deadly to the film is its over length and snail like pace. this is a two and a half hour film that feels twice that.Personally I wish Kubrick had lived a little longer since I'd have love to hear what his take on all of this was. At times the film seems like it wants to be a black comedy, at other times a porn film. Its a thriller at other times, though it really doesn't have a pay off, or if it does certainly not one that is worth fighting sleep for the better part of three hours. Seeing it again, I'm of the opinion that with the exception of one person I think most people who love this film are doing so because its Kubrick and they think he must have known what he was doing. I would argue that he didn't",4,3,8,8 January 2008
Departures," Deeply moving
","Oscar Winner for Best Foreign Language Film this year shocked many people because unless you were in the academy or in Japan you didn't see it. Having seen it I can completely understand why it won. It may not be the best Foreign Language film of the year, but it certainly one of the most touching and moving. The plot is simple, a cellist for a large orchestra suddenly finds himself with out a gig. Moving home with his wife he applies for a job that has short hours and big pay unaware that its for a firm that prepares the dead for 'departure'. Needing the money and liking the people he meets he takes the job, but doesn't tell his wife. The film is what happens as he tries to find his place in this new world. Stunning, charming, moving, magical, if you're like me you will be reduced to tears. I absolutely loved this film a great deal. I loved everyone. I loved how you felt the pain and joy of everyone. I loved the small details, the holes in the floor of the couples home that were put there by the young cellist, or asking for some lipstick for the deceased. Small details that make it all real. One of the most heartfelt films I've seen.",9,1,2,15 June 2009
The Descent," Good movie thriller ruined by a need to throw in a clich√© twist every ten minutes
","I'm not sure how to write about this movie without talking about spoilers, so I'm just going to plow ahead and mention that THIS REVIEW IS FULL OF SPOILERS, so if you don't want to to know, don't read any further.This movie is the story of a group of friends who decide to go exploring caves. One of their number has suffered a terrible tragedy in the form of a car crash that killed her husband and daughter. (The accident is simply one of the most jarring moments in movie history and is as big a punch in the face as anything that happens in the rest of the movie). Once the group gets to the cave everything begins to go wrong. Worse still is that it isn't long before they find out that there is something terrible in the cave with them.I have to say at the outset this is a well made and well acted film. Any problems I have with the film, and I have many, are do to the story line. This is one of those movies that should have been better.HEAVY SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT I dislike the plot twists in this movie a great deal, its not that they are in and of themselves bad, rather they are of the sort that are so incredibly clich√©d or designed to keep the plot moving. First they don't go to the cave they were suppose to because their leader considers it a tourist trap, worse they never told anyone where they went; They never take the guide book on the caves of the area; they seem to lose what ever it is they need moments before they need it. Most amazing of all is the one that shows up about an hour into the movie. Even though its alluded to earlier, the creators of this little thriller have added a race of blind goblins to the mix, in away that seems completely out of left field. Here's a taut movie about a bunch of friends trapped underground upon which they've added some creatures from the road company of The Lord of The Rings. At that point I just threw up my hands and gave up. Its not bad, its just not in line with everything else.I don't know what to say. This is one of those movies where things would move along on a logical path, except the writer keeps throwing twists at the characters for no good reason other than it movies the plot in the direction he wants it to go. I wouldn't care, but its always when the twist would do the most damage. I also wouldn't care if it wasn't every ten or fifteen minutes, once I could buy, maybe twice, but three or four or five times? It ruins the genuine suspense and feeling that movie naturally creates.Try this on video or cable. Just don't be rushing out to see it since you may end up disappointed, like I was, at having to watch a good little thriller hobbled by dumb plot twists.",5,6,11,26 August 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," What I say doesn't matter
","I'm not a fan of the books. The ones I read seem like Roald Dahl wannabes. To me the books were young adult fiction that seems like young adult fiction.This the, film version of the first book is actually pretty good, but suffers painfully from the fact that it attempts to get everything in the book on the screen. I am certain that the film would have been a classic had someone had the balls to reshape the novel into a movie instead of trying to make the movie into the novel. If you want to see a good, but not great movie, and to get a faithful feeling for one of the most successful series of books ever made without having to days reading the books then by all means watch this, just expect frequent draggy spots.",6,1,5,10 April 2004
The Happening," Even though the scary moments are wasted thanks to poorly drawn central characters this is the best the director has done in quite a while
","M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece of a misfire about the end of the world.The plot of the film has a sudden rash of suicides on a colossal scale spiraling outward from New York's Central Park. People freeze for a moment and then when they begin to move again do themselves in. In Philadelphia a school teacher and his wife decide to flee into the country with friends, but the danger is following them.What can I say I'm both floored and angered by this film. The premise and the scenes of (self) destruction are some of the most terrifying and unnerving scenes put on film. Shyamalan wins back a great deal of the points I held against him with some of the best horror scenes of the year. Its creepy. Even the neatness with which some people kill themselves is unpleasant. Many of the scenes are some of the best of the year.However before you run out to see this let me add a huge BUT the central characters, aided and abetted by Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel who play them, sink this film. Actually pretty much most of the 'character' and non event scenes are really weak, its as if they were cut in from another movie completely. Some have complained its the performances that sink the film, I would argue that the writing does more damage then the poor performances. Its just that this is not a film for the sort of characters shown to us to inhabit its space. This is a film that should have had no stars and should have been almost documentary like in the telling. The conventions of typical character driven cinema don't work with a story like this. If we had somehow been allowed to remain thrust into things with out an attempt at making people we can follow in a nuclear family sort of way this would have worked so much better. Do we really need to know about what may or may not have happened at Deschanel and Wahlberg's wedding? not really. This could have been a nice companion piece to last years The Mist, but its not. The reason we need a non-conventional means of telling the story is that once we know whats happening, nothing is really done with it.(If nothing else you need a non-conventional story telling because the thing-the monster- is invisible or nothing) There's this run up to the end of the world but by putting a conventional couple into it you realize that its only clever to a point and that it really doesn't go anywhere once its all set up. Its like having someone telling you the start of a great adventure story-that hooks you with a great set up only to the storyteller wander off with out taking it any farther- leaving you to go what happens next? Better than the last couple of films made by M. Night Shyamalan, but not one I would say to run out to see in theaters. Worth a look on DVD or cable.Best way I can describe it- when it works its a nice companion piece to Shyamalan's Signs (or the parts that worked before the illogic took over) 5 ish out of 10 for the creepy parts",6,6,13,15 June 2008
The Fountain," Intensely personal story may be tough going if you can't click into its vibe
","Intensely personal about love and loss by Darren Aronofsky.Three 'stories' that are actually inter related. A conquistador looks for the fountain of youth, a researcher deals with the impending death of his wife, and years later the researcher travels in space with the tree of life.Visually stunning this movie will either enthrall you or bore you. Its either going to strike you as twaddle or a grand explanation of loving someone so much that they are your life. Its as personal as a film can get and you either travel to that place or you'll think the director is mad. I will not presume to know how anyone will relate to it.Late at night, half asleep was the wrong time for me to see this. I am in awe at how personal the film is and I can admire how much of a masterpiece it is, but at the same time it didn't fully click with me. I liked it but I didn't love it. Its like a painting where you can admire the greatness of it, but you wouldn't hang it in your home. I see what it is and I can discuss it dispassionately, but at the same time I don't know if I need it in my collection.Then again I need to see this again simply because I don't know if I was as receptive as I should have been (besides its great to look at) Worth a look if you understand what you're getting into...actually more than worth a look, anyone wanting to be challenged by a film, especially an American film, should give it a shot.",8,4,8,31 January 2007
Zombieland," Funny horror comedy is one of the best mixing of genres in years. Its only real flaw is it kind of runs out of steam at the end
","College nerd living alone manages to survive the zombie plague by having no friends or close family. Heading out on the road to get to his parents in Columbus Ohio , Columbus hooks up with Tallahassee and begins looking for survivors, and Twinkies. They then hook up with two young women and travel West¬Ö Funny horror comedy is funnier the better you know the zombie films its sending up. This isn't to say that the film isn't funny otherwise, it is, but as Columbus rattles off his rules, some of which are illustrated and some of which aren't, knowing the films adds a certain amount of weight. The cast is mostly dead on with Woody Harrelson giving a hysterical turn as Tallahassee , a man who has finally found that the one thing he is best at is killing zombies.I don't think the film is perfect. I found the much heralded cameo by a certain actor not quite as funny as advertised. I also found that the final set piece doesn't work as well as the rest of the film, coming off more as weak excuse at ending the film in a spectacular manner rather than as something that makes sense.Still I really liked the film and think if you like bloody horror comedies you should give the film a shot.",7,0,1,21 October 2009
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Some really clever bits are done in by an annoying Jack Black and limited vocabulary
","The story of how Tenacious D came together.This is a movie I can admire more than I can like. I like the fact its got whole passages that are sung, I like the weird trips it takes, I like the craft of the film. In its way its a bastard sibling of Idlewild and its go for broke atmosphere. Unfortunately what its trying to do and what it does in spurts doesn't amount to add up to much. Jack Black plays Jack Black in his real annoying mode and while this does count for something some times, mostly I wanted to slap him and say grow up. The use of oral sex related terms is easily to be counted as way too obsessive. The words are not the sort of things that bleed into the background, and while I'm no prude, I wonder how a movie that is often as visually stunning and as clever as this one is can have such a limited vocabulary when it comes to dialog. The effect is to lessen everything else.That said its not a bad movie but its not as good as it should have been, nor is it one thats going to bear repeat viewings.",4,0,5,3 September 2007
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better than the First
","Able to do away with with character introductions the second Harry Potter film can move straight on with action.Although the film still suffers from being a bit too long the film has nowhere near as many draggy parts as the first one. If anything its the rabbit to the first one's turtle.Set pieces involving Ron's magic flying car are wonderful, and the spiders in this film would give the spider in Return of the King a run for their money. If you liked the first film, or even if you didn't, give this film a try since its a large step in the right direction of fantasy films.(Although a large cash reward for the remains of that annoying house elf will be paid if it can be promised that I will never have to set eyes on him again.)",8,0,1,10 April 2004
The Departed," Good, but very familiar story of cops and robbers
","Remake of Infernal Affairs is not the second coming of the gangster film that some proclaimed it. It is a very good, if decidedly over long tale of cops battling robbers with moles on each side trying to remain hidden.The plot is simple, a cop is sent undercover in the mob at the same time a crook works his way into the police force. Complicating matters is the fact that the bosses on both sides quickly realize that a rat is among and they begin the search to ferret out the mole.The original Infernal Affairs is one of the better Hong Kong Films of the last ten years. Its a well told tale with some nice stylish twists. If the original has any flaws its that the film falls in love with itself in the second half and becomes a bit too showoffy. Thats not the case here, here the story has been refashioned and rethought into a gritty tale of Irish cops and robbers in Boston. Its different enough to discourage comparisons, which is a good thing in these days of shot for shot remakes.Martin Scorsese has fashioned a really good film. The cast is mostly excellent, with only Jack Nicholson ruining things with an occasional lapse into stereotypical 'Jackisms'. Leonardo DiCaprio has at last arrived as an actor and turns in an excellent performance as the cop gone deep undercover. His performance is sure to garner an Oscar nomination.I really liked this film but I didn't love it. The film carries a sense of having been down this road before, not because its a remake, as I said it different enough to rebuke comparison, rather its because it takes the gangster films of the past thirty years and compresses them together and has a very familiar feel. It reminded me of several other films about the Irish mobs, State of Grace in particular, so it didn't strike me as ground breaking the way The Godfather or Goodfellas did upon first seeing them.My one real complaint with the film is that it takes too log to get where its going. Yes its tense and it keeps you on the edge of your seat but when it was over I felt as though I had been watching it for twice its length. A good movie should fly by and make you lose track of time. I was checking my watch through out much of the second half of this movie.Definitely worth seeing, but I'm not sure you're going to love it, so much as you're going to like it.7 out of 10.",7,9,12,2 November 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Its all visuals since the poor excuse for the plot and alleged performances by the actors make this tough haul
","One of the most spectacular films ever put out, it has some truly amazing sights that boggle the mind, more so since they are so clear and sharp in exactly the way real life never is. This is eye candy of the highest order and it will blow your mind.The question is will you have any mind left after watching a film that is so badly written and so poorly acted (with the exception of John Turturro) that its best if turn off your higher functions and just watch the pretty destruction? I don't know. Clearly we haven't moved beyond the concept of bread and circuses when it comes to entertainment, otherwise how else would you explain the huge take at the box office. This is one of the worst written films I've ever seen, and if you've read any number of the reviews I've posted then you know I've seen some real dogs.The plot has something to do with the Desepticons wanting to get their hands on a power source that will allow them to take over the universe and Shia LaBeouf has the key. Lots of destruction happens as a result and everyone ends up in Egypt (but not before we get lots of slow mo cheese cake shots of Megan Fox). I would try to mention the holes in the plot but that would assume that there really was one and not something scribbled on the back of a napkin. I also will not get into the lack of internal consistency and internal illogic since that would be like hitting one's head against a wall for a week. (And I won't get into the steals from other films and TV shows)Then again plot isn't why this movie exists its the robots and Megan Fox. Those two things are the reason this movie is making a mint since its the two things that most 12 year old boys are most interested in.I will say it is infinitely better than the first film, the writing is worse but the action is better. See it with a great picture and you'll be wowed. I vote waiting for DVD where the remote will help you get past the exposition scenes that make the film two and a half hours film like two and a half weeks.",4,35,89,28 June 2009
War of the Worlds," Visually arresting but emotionally empty alien invasion tale
","How do I say this? Directly perhaps? I didn't like it.Its cold and distant and wildly illogical. Cruise is too cocky and too stony. It never really welcomed me in since it was so carefully calculated to ever embrace me with a real hug. I suppose that if you go in and forgive the logic holes you'll have a good time.(SPOILERS AHAEAD) Logic holes is too small a term, chasms is better all electronics are down in some areas, yet one man has a working camcorder, Cruise hijacks the ONE working car in his neighborhood, They've been here for centuries but we never noticed the buried tripods and a few more that boggle the mind including the ending. What ever you do not think about this movie. (END SPOILERS) The tripods are great and the images of them in action are amazing, its what I always hoped the tripods would look like, but to me they are operating in a vacuum, or were lifted from another better movie. They are never really connected to the human story.Yes, it follows the book plot-wise, but its missing the one thing the book and the Gene Barry version had in spades, which was a heart. (Barry cameos in the film) There is no heart just people and machines going through the motions pretending to be under attack. You never connect, or I least didn't.As to whether you should see it on the big screen, its a toss up. The visuals are a gas, but the people aren't. Your choice, but I'd say wait.

30 Days of Night," I wanted to love this instead of like it
","As the 30 days of night sets in the town finds itself under siege by a group of vampires. Filled with haunting images this film was mixed bag for me. To be certain the build up to the siege is very good. There is something about the way the story is told that keeps you watching even though its not the most logical of story lines. The problem for me is that once things really get set in motion there are lapses in logic that distract from often fun proceedings. Granted I was watching this very late at night so there is a chance that I missed something, but I never quite understood why the vampires-if they were so clever to get to Barrow because of the night would have waded into the population with such a blood lust that would have left them with no one to eat two days after they started. There are a few other WTF moments that keep the film from being great, but over all its worth a shot on cable on a Saturday night if nothing else.",6,1,2,5 January 2008
There Will Be Blood," Final section of the film damages what is other wise a great film
","Story of Daniel Plainview a silver miner who switches to oil. The film charts the course of Plainview's life over 30 years as his fortunes rise and he descends into madness.Going into the film I was carrying a great deal of baggage. The promise of a truly great film is tough thing to have to live up to. Hailed by many as a classic film on par with many of the cinema's greatest offerings I'm left to wonder if its all hyperbole since the film has barely been on view to the public for roughly a months time and true classics are created in the long term not the short. It will be for time to tell us if the film that has been fashioned here is the masterpiece or an also ran.For me the film is very good, but I found it considerably less than the 'one of the greatest films' that the film has been handed by some critics. To be certain the film is excellent on almost every level technically. It is sterling achievement of the film maker's art. The problem for me is that the film falls apart in the final stretch and collapses into simplicity in the final scene. Its rather hard to discuss this with out going into detail, something that may or may not ruin things if you haven't seen the film. Since I don't want to spoil anything I'm going to choose not to discuss things other then to say the denouncement did not work for me and in a way renders most of what happens prior less than it seemed.I do think that the film is worth seeing. I just think it's not the be all and end all or recent American cinema.8.5 to 1927, considerably less after that. 6.5 over all",6,6,14,28 January 2008
Man on Fire," Why is this Two and a Half Hours?
","Long ago I saw a nice small little thriller called Man on Fire with Scott Glenn. It wasn't the best movie, it wasn't the worst, it was a good little thriller.  Now some years later Tony Scott returns to the source material of that shorter and perhaps better thriller and makes an overlong revenge thriller.The plot is basically follows the down on his luck intelligence man begins work with a family. The daughter and he bond. When she is kidnapped and the ransom drop goes wrong he begins a long bloody trail to get revenge.And there are twists and turns and...why is this so long?More importantly why has Tony Scott been allowed to create one of the most annoying visual styles on record? The subtitles that seem to randomly appear make me wonder at Scott's sanity since they distract from the film not add to it.There are nice bits in this. The acting is top notch. But its way way too long and seems to go on for no real reason.Despite being too much its not bad (5 out of 10) but if you ask me, wait for cable.",5,2,5,19 June 2004
The Last King of Scotland," Good but unremarkable portrait of Amin fails to stand out from pretty much any other portrait of the dictator
","Idealist young man becomes a doctor and instead of following in his dads footsteps goes to Uganda to do some good. His arrival coincides with the coup that placed Idi Amin in power. At first enthralled by the new President he slowly begins to realize that all is not well as he journeys from country doctor to physician to the man himself.Well made and well acted story is a bit unremarkable dramatically especially if you've seen any of the exploitation films on Amin or even Barbet Schroeder's Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait.Forrest Whitaker is excellent as Amin. I'm not sure his performance is really Oscar worthy since the only real difference between his performance and some of the other people who've played Amin-say Joseph Olita in Amin: The Rise and Fall, is that he has a better script to work with. Since its such a show offy role that its easy to take an excellent and rightfully praised performance, and make it seem like its 'the best' of the year when its one of the best. Its a good but not great film. Add it to the long list of films that are Oscar winners for reasons that will escape you two years hence.",6,1,2,3 September 2007
August Rush," I HATE this film
","You will either buy into this contrived tale of orphan who hears music then runs off New York to find his parents or you won't.I didn't.Cloyingly cute I had no patience for it and squirmed from the opening bits of the kid conducting the wind, through the flash back meeting of young rock star dad and rich girl cellist torn apart by her disapproving dad, on to the really annoying Robin 'Please put my head in a duck press to make me stop screaming' Williams and then to the oh gee ending. I hated almost every moment other than the music. Whats worse was I didn't bail when I had the chance (what would it take stand up and walk out) and stayed to the hand holding ending in the hope that it would all turn around and I'd get weepy. No such luck.

The Reader," Good but not great
","Good film about the relationship of a young man who meets an older woman with whom he has an affair, little suspecting her past or how it would effect the rest of his life. Multi-Oscar nominated film is a good little drama, but one that has left me scratching my head as to it's best picture nomination.(Equally bizarre is Kate Winslett's Golden Globe win as a supporting actress when she's on screen a large chunk of the film) While I do like the film, I don't love it. I found it often as distant as the lead male character becomes. For me the problem that David Hare's script often reduces the inner conflict of the hero by having him speak not from the heart but the head. Basically, the dialog is much too clunky and it under cuts much of the rest of the emotion. Its not one of David Hare's better works (I'm a huge Hare fan and rarely has his dialog ever just sort of laid there like a dry text book). Its a good film and I do recommend it, but as as best picture contender I would discount it as not quite in the league of the other four nominees. (I'd give Winslet the edge on best actress)",7,7,11,22 February 2009
Hancock," Major misfire with too much going on. Only comes alive in sporadic moments
","Major misfire from Will Smith concerning a superhero with a drinking problem who decides to redo his image of destruction.Based on what many have considered a great script 'Tonight He Comes' (which I haven't read but which I've read about) this is a movie with some really good ideas, which after bobbling them for an hour drops them as they add another 15 to the mix.The idea is that its lonely being a superhero and that one would eventually begin to drink because one was all alone. Drink causes problems as does anger problems- usually resulting in millions of dollars in insurance claims. The idea is rather clever and its one thats been used before in better films like Superguy: Behind the Cape a pseudo-documentary about the problems of being a superhero. Its a good idea as I said and there are moments here where they pull it off but its only in the odd moment and every now and again.(even if there are tons of unanswered logic problems) Which is fine for the first hour where the jokes and the effort to put something together comes across as an okay time filler (which I hated to spend money on-at its best this is a cable flick). The trouble is that about an hour into the movie it begins to add in plot points that come out of left field. First there is a twist that plays out badly over the next half hour then a major plot development occurs that drives the film to its conclusion. In that last half hour enough plot for at least another 90 minutes is set up and the rushed through.Of course the twists are so WTF that with in the context of the film that as it stands now that the film completely falls on its face. I kept wanting to reach for the remote to jump to the end (curse the movie theater experience).There is a good story in there somewhere but someone-probably several someones- botched the film.(I read there were lots of rewrites and passes through the editing suites) A perfect example of how not to make a movie by committee (and will probably be on my worst of the year list for that reason).a final 3 out of 10 (despite some early moments and great lines) This kind of skirts the PG13 and R border. I thought it was R until I saw other wise. Frankly its probably more R then PG13 thanks to language and violence",3,7,16,5 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Better than the last two but not as good as it should have been
","George Lucas has finished this latest Star Wars trilogy with what should have been the best of any of them but poor acting, laughable plot twists due in what is actually an okay movie.The problem in part is that Lucas has to get things to where we know they should be so he's been forced to twist events to get there. The sequence where Anakin relents and goes over to the dark side is illogically plotted and I never believed it. The film is littered with moments that made me wonder what Lucas thinking.But sequences like the battle on the lava planet make the film worth seeing. I can't say thats it worth owning, but it was worth seeing once.I just wish that Lucas had made the choice to let someone else write and direct this final film. He's at last given us a story thats worth hearing, unfortunately he's not very good at telling it to us.FYI- I've rated the film as a one out of ten, its really a six or so. I've done it to counter balance all of the rave reviews since its no where near as good as some feel it is.",1,19,39,22 May 2005
Inception," Good but over long and not that clever
","Its all flash and little substance in Christopher Nolan's over long story of people able to go into the dreams of others.I'm not going to go into the plot, partly to play fair with those of you who haven't see the film, but Nolan has constructed a film so needlessly messy that its damn near impossible to summarize simply.Yes the visuals are spectacular, though most of them are obviously CGI creations. There are also fewer than you would think since the dream weavers of the story have to keep thing real in order to achieve their ends.For me the story isn't much of anything,certainly not enough to support a two and a half hour tale. The deepness of Nolan's 'philosophy' is also over done, and ultimately meaningless since Nolan is on record as saying it's all been made up and exists purely to drive his plot.I like the story I just wish it didn't take so long to get where it was going.I also hate that Nolan changes the rules about half way in as a means of making things more exciting. Its not fair and I was so annoyed I walked out of the theater the first time I saw the film.Good not great, its worth a look see down the road.",7,18,30,18 September 2010
Defiance," Good but haven't we been here before?
","Tale of Three Jewish brother who flee into the forest when the Nazi's invade.Along the way they end up picking up people who swell their ranks. The film covers their first two years in hiding and as acting as partisans fighting against the Nazi's. Good film is utterly unremarkable in everything except its two lead performances. If you've seen any number of recent world war two films you've seen something similar (I'm convinced that director Zwick stole bits of how he filmed this from the great Russian film Come and See).Indeed it seemed to me that any characters other than those played by Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber were from the Second world War Stack Character Bureau. This isn't a bad film its just a very much run of the mill, I've been here before sort of one. (I have to say that I'm kind of boggled by the way that Zwick's films have been heralded as great. To be sure he's pulling to be the Stanley Kramer of our time by taking on 'issues' in his films but at the same time I'm left to ponder if its the issues people are loving rather than the film. I personally think that he's better film maker when he just tells a story like in Legends of the Fall rather than in films like Courage Under Fire, Glory, Blood Diamond and The Siege)",6,5,11,19 January 2009
Lord of War," Very good story of an arms dealer hurt by occasional preaching
","Nick Cage is an arms dealer who tells us about his life and how the world, and his conscious has changed over time.This is a wonderfully made film. Its witty, well acted and contains some technically brilliant shots and sequences. This is a film thats a kick in the head and forces you to think about what people like Cage's character are doing to the world. Cage gives a wonderful performance as a man who begins doing something no one else is and manages to make enough money he can get everything he ever wanted,However he never expected it to weigh so heavily on his soul. The film does a great job of showing the truly bizarre world that Cage inhabits. Its all food for thought.Unfortunately the film often undermines itself by being overly preachy with too many passages that are about the statistics of what the weapons are doing to our world. There are too many times where in the name of expediency people talk about what all of the weapons are doing, as if the story itself isn't enough proof.I liked this movie a great deal, the problem is that I wanted to like it more. Its one of those films thats really good but which has something keeping it from being great.Definitely worth trying at some point.",7,1,6,10 October 2005
Sherlock Holmes," I can't wait for the sequels
","Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson have survived for the better part of 150 years thanks to to the characters ability to shift and change with the times. Despite all the shifts and changes the characters have always remained the same stalwart heroes at the center.Such it is with Guy Ritchie's reinvention of Holmes as an action hero. Sure he is moving about in a more frenetic style, but at the same time he is at his center the same Sherlock Holmes we've always known and loved.Here the case involves a certain Lord Blackwood who appears to have come back from the dead in a bid to take over the British Empire. Add to the mix the imminent departure of Watson for wedded bliss and the reappearance of Irene Adler and its clear Holmes has more on his plate then is usual.What can I say but this is a perfectly adequate Holmes for our day, or any day for that matter. Downey's wonderful twist on the great detective is its clear he is neither infallible nor a machine. Homes missteps and he is very much a feeling sort of person, bother for what he perceives as his abandonment by Watson and his lust for the lovely Miss Adler. Downey makes Homes much more human than almost anyone I've ever seen other than perhaps Christopher Plummer in Murder by Decree. Actually I should note that the relationship between Holmes and Watson in this film and in Murder by Decree are the only two times where I find it clear why the two are friends. (Yes its clear in the Jeremy Brett series but there is more joy here and in Decree) I should also say that Jude Law's Watson is a wonderful man of action that runs roughshod over a century of ineffective Watsons.I loved this film a great deal. And if there is anything that kept this film from making my best of the year list it's that the film's frantic pace becomes too much at the end and the film kind of loses its focus at the end ad events become BIGGER for no real reason other then spectacle.A must see for anyone wanting to see a ripping yarn.",9,1,3,3 January 2010
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Damning indictment of the cost of war
","When North Korea invades the South, two brothers are forcibly drafted into the army. The older of the two, hoping to win a medal and ticket home for his younger brother, begins going on every suicide mission offered. This, however, puts a strain on his relationship with his brother and those in the platoon. Worse the course of the war has several nasty turns waiting for them...I'm of two minds about this film. Despite the fact this is a graphic example of both the physical and psychic effects of war, the narrative is more than a bit disjointed. The film is loosely connected snapshots of the course of the war, beginning right before the invasion, then several weeks later before jumping about a month at a time to certain key events. I'm sure that had I better grasp of the history of the war I would have understood the events better. I felt lost and wished there had been more explanation. The lack of a narrative that follows all the way from start to finish hurts the film since we're moved a bit too much from place to place and situation to situationBut the course of the war is not the purpose of the film, rather its the relationship between two brothers. How war changes them and everything in and around them except the love they have for each other. Its a bit hokey but its dead on, just ask anyone who's ever loved their sibling unquestioningly. You understand how one brother would spend 50 years trying to find the other.And then there are the battle scenes which are wonderful and frightening and seem to be the total chaos that war really is. People die horribly and the experience is far from fun.Is the movie worth seeing?Yes. Its not perfect but its a kick in the pants.8 out of 10.",8,56,73,4 December 2004
WALL¬∑E," Good but not great, despite some wonderful pieces
","This is the story of Wall-E a robot who is alone working on earth cleaning up the polluted planet. One day he finds a plant and takes it home. When one day a space ship lands Wall-E meets EVE who has been left on the planet for some reason. The reason is to find signs that plants are returning, so when Wall-E shows EVE the planet she sends a signal for pick up and is whisked back to a space ship where all of mankind has been living-with Wall-E in pursuit.This is a mostly wordless feature film not only about robots who fall in love but also what it means to be human and what it means to be alive. Its also a satire, of sorts, about the fat lazy people that we in the West have become.Technically this is one of the most beautifully animated films that Pixar has done. Its wonderful to look at. The places and spaces and the characters are all beautifully rendered. The film creates more than good number of real characters, both robots and people and its the characters that make the film worth seeing.The problem is that the story is a bit of a mess. On the one hand you have the central story of the romance of Wall-E and EVE, but you also have this glaring social commentary looming over everything. From the polluted Earth of the first half to the fat people in space during the second. Which is more important? To me its the romance and its there that the film shines. Frankly I got teary during any number of sequences dealing with the romance. Unfortunately the 'get the plant so we can go home story' kind of goes nowhere smoothly as situation keeps being inserted again and again to keep it going. On top of that we have the not so hidden messages about how lazy we all are and how happiness is 'not following the path'. The story goes from well told story about Wall-e and Eve to the Captain (who is wonderful and under utilized-I wanted more of him) to the two human 'lovers' John and Mary who begin to see life out side of their hoover-chairs.There is this really good robot romance stuck in here thats gotten lost somewhere along the way. I was sobbing during the four minute trailer that was floating around a few months ago that focused beautifully on the romance. I went from not being sure if it would work to being sure they hit it out of the park. There's this wonderful simple story locked in there with all this not as wonderful stuff around it. (A word of warning- the trailers give a good number of gags away) Yes I've complain about every Pixar Movie. (Toy Story 2 isn't as good as the first one, Bugs Life is too slow, Monsters Inc was not quite Toys Story, Nemo didn't completely thrill me, Incredibles is too long, Cars is too simple and their eyes wig me out, Ratatouille, while very good, isn't the the great second coming many claimed) Say What you will I own all but A Bugs Life. Other than Cars I think all have improved with time (thanks to the critical claim that this Pixar is the next big thing no loner being considered) And while I do think Ratatouille has too much story and needs to be trimmed down, I don't think that any of them have as many problems story wise as this (certainly none has as many character needing exploration and fleshing out).What is this film about-really I don't know. I adore the romance and wish I had someone to take to see it since its so charming, but at the same time...I don't know it all doesn't come together for me.Perhaps I could see some of the story line too clearly. I could tell what the next shot was or the next motion would be. Perhaps I saw too many jokes in the trailers and commercials. Maybe it was the god awful Hello Dolly clip playing over and over and over. Maybe it was the one movie too many that played Le Vie En Rose. I don't know. there is something about the film that doesn't allow it to hang together for me. I admire its construction but I don't love the result.I still like it. I'd give it between 6.5 to 7 out of 10, but at the same time the parts are better then the whole.Go see it and make up your own mind-if nothing else there are some really neat things in it.",7,17,34,4 July 2008
The Good Shepherd," One of the best of 2006
","The history of the CIA by way of one man who 'was there'. This is the story of Edward Wilson (based upon James Jesus Angelton) who joined the intelligence services prior to the second World War and was there at the start of the CIA. This story goes from Wilson's time in college until the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs. This is a long involved story and its easily one of the best films of 2006.I won't try to sum up the film which begins at the Bay of Pigs and then flashes back through Wilson's life. I will say that enjoyment of the film will depend upon how one reacts to Matt Damon as Wilson. Damon is excellent in what is a tough role. Its a tough because Wilson is essentially a cypher, he barely says a word and when it does its usually to give orders or for some piece of business.Indeed when Wilson does open up or show emotion it usually costs him dearly. Wilson's cold icy demeanor is what makes him the perfect spy. Actually just being in the business costs him too much as we witness over the cost of the film.I liked it, with the film drawing me in and wanting to see what happens next. Nit picker that I am the only real problem with the film is the lack of aging of Matt Damon which makes it difficult sometimes to know when we are in Wilson's life since he always looks the same.Definitely worth a look, though I won't guarantee you'll be as rapturous as I am because of the cypher at the center of the film.",10,1,2,31 January 2007
The Terminal," Not Quite but Almost
","This is the story of one man stranded in an airline terminal when his country goes through political upheaval while he was in transit.
I'm told its based on a true story, but any connection between this movie and reality is a mistake.Steven Spielberg is a good filmmaker. For years he's cranked out film classics. The problem is that many of them exist with in their own reality which isn't even remotely real. This is film suffers from this problem in spades.I never once felt that this film was even remotely real on any level what so ever.SPOILERS AHEAD You'll forgive me but I couldn't ever really accept anything in this film. For example, and in order, Why is Hanks the only one with this problem? Why does person after person talk to Hanks but no one gets a interpreter? Why is Hanks simply turned loose into the terminal when he can barely speak English? How does Hanks pick up English so fast? I could go on for almost every plot twist but I won't. END SPOILERSThis is a well made but completely unreal film. Since the situations were unreal I couldn't care what happen to anyone in the film since they seemed so unreal, Hanks first and foremost. His whole character was simply a bad Russian like accent.Its not bad, its just not anything you care about.Four out of Ten.",4,2,8,20 June 2004
The Blind Side," A very good film that only suffers from everything being so perfectly wonderful (and an ending that you know going in)
","Story of Michael Oher a kid from the wrong side of the tracks, who's father dies and mother is an addict. He's given a chance to go to an expensive prep school because of his size, but academically can barely keep up. Brought home one day by the parents, the Touhys, of one of his friends Big Mike when they find out he has no where else to go he finds himself adopted and his whole life transformed.Probably the biggest feel good film of the year looks to be heading towards Oscar nominations if not actual wins. Its a well made, well acted film that looks and feels like a real winner.Why then am I so unhappy? Mostly I'm unhappy since the film is so by the numbers that there is little chance to feel anything but inspiration and a sense that this is 'so great'. Its so wonderfully cheery that I got a sugar rush. There seems to have been very little in the way of obstacles, its just nice people doing the right thing and helping a good kid. Granted it doesn't help that the ultimate ending has been touted in all of the press for the film (Oher was recruited by the NFL) but at the same time it leaves little in the way of discovery for the audience except those who want to be lead by the nose to a conclusion they know going in.Don't get me wrong, its not a bad movie, its actually quite good, its just emotionally suspect with any feeling coming from the buttons it clearly is pushing.(I know old Hollywood used to do the same thing but they could at least trick you into not seeing the buttons) Much better than the 6 out of 10 I've rated it, I simply can't rate it higher because its too manipulative.",6,2,3,29 November 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," Over Rated
","There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story. Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film. On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.
This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one.",7,69,156,24 April 2004

","High school kid ends up being trained by a martial arts master to fight a kid who is bullying his friends.Considering the number of movies that are being turned out the last few years with this same basic plot I'm happy to report that this is better than you might think film should be. It's filled with good performances which helps get over the spots that you've seen a thousand times before. The only problem is the script which is 'better than average clich√©' which means it hits pretty much every point you can think of typical for a movie like this.Worth seeing, but not as good as it should have been-The cast and the director deserved a better script.",5,0,0,28 June 2009
Prometheus," Looks great but the plot is a mess
","Visually stunning but completely ludicrous tale of scientists going to look for god or at least man's creator on a far off planet.Shades of Wizard of Mars and Star Trek 5. Of course there are monsters, but mostly there are some really stupid people doing some really stupid things in order to drive the plot.No one behaves like a normal person anywhere in this film with the result being that the film is driven forward simply because people refuse to do the rational thing.I saw this at a sneak preview at Lincoln Center and at no point did anyone jump. The only reaction were applause at references to Ridley Scott's Alien and laughter in the final half hour as things got more and more silly.That the film works at all is thanks to a some odd set pieces that seem to be operating in a vacuum and to an incredible visual style that keeps the audience interested even when any rational person would have walked out.A huge miss by Scott.",5,11,22,4 June 2012
The Queen," More like watching events really unfold rather than watching a movie
","Excellent story about Tony Blair and the Queen in the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana. Its a wonderful look at how the royals are disconnected from the world and how some people try to keep them connected. Its very much like watching the events unfold before you. As good as it is there is a but, the but comes at the end, which for me isn't so much a conclusion as a stoppage. The film ends but, for me there is no conclusion, there is no point other than this is what happened over these days. On that level its great, but I don't know why I'm being told it. I enjoyed it but I was left wanting at the end. Absolutely worth seeing...",7,4,7,16 September 2007
1408," Great Hollywood horror, a rare find these days
","Don't watch this just before you go to bed. The movie hung with me and I rally didn't sleep, not because I was scared rather I didn't want my head to end up in a 1408 existence.The plot has John Cusack as a writer of horror guide books (10 haunted lighthouses) who goes to a hotel in new York and stays in room 1408 where people either die or go insane or both. Cusack is certain there is nothing to the stories, of course he finds out otherwise.Creepy horror story thats one of the better Hollywood horror movies in years. It helps not to be a remake or a complete retread like most of the recent crap we've been subjected to recently. A genuine horror movie as opposed to one of the thrillers (Disturbia, Vacancy, etc) where things do bump in the night and ghosts do seem to walk. I liked this movie a great deal. Its not the be all and end all of horror movies but it is a nice creepy little distractions.If there are any real flaws to the film they are minor. There is perhaps a bit too many effects, the scariest moments are the ones with out them. Also the casting of John Cusack, while very good on the face of it, distracts from the sense that this is a real hotel and events happening to a real person. It doesn't diminish the scares, except perhaps that you know on some level there will be a suitable ending. (I could almost argue that Samuel l Jackson, in what amounts to a cameo, is too Hollywood as well except that his presence and delivery, especially of the 'Its an evil f#%$ing room' line that adds a great deal of weight to what follows. I don't know if the movie would have been as frightening with out his dire warnings)",7,1,2,26 August 2007
Mary and Max," Moving story of two misfits is one of the best films of 2009
","Its been 24 hours since I've seen Mary and Max and find I've been deeply affected by the film. Its the story of a little girl who needs to know somethings so she writes a letter to a random person in America only to connect with an sweet man with some decided peculiar ways. What happens after that is a series of ups and downs that happen over the course of 20 years. A unique film its possibly the best animated film from 2009, and its one of the best films of the year. Rarely has a film left me so emotionally moved, certainly there are even fewer that have made me feel this way many hours after the fact. I feel as though I'm carrying the characters and emotions around inside me. And in a way I'm at a loss for words. A beautifully animated film with dialog that is witty and wise and wonderful, this is a marvelously made film. However its the characters where it shines. All of the characters, even if they are somewhat clich√©, are painfully real. We know someone like everyone of them. Your heart goes out to them and is carried by them because they are so real. Its the characters we remember and we return to and who carry the film even as the second half gets messy. A masterpiece.",10,9,17,14 November 2009
Iron Man," I think they got it right and made a fine action film as a result
","I loved it...do you need more than that? Okay the comic geek who red a huge chunk of every appearance of the character was pleased in spirit if not in action. Like the first time we saw and heard Wolverine's claws come out in the first X-Men movie, the moment that kind of sold me was when the camera pulls back to reveal Tony's mansion-and it was Tony's mansion (Later the comic book team Avengers' west coast headquarters). At that point I knew it was all okay, at that moment the geek went away and said they got it right and calmed down.yea its an origin story and yea you know how its going to come out- but the neat thing is there is a sense of danger, that everything may not be okay-hey Tony is injured in the opening minutes so you know he can and will be hurt. I love that its an origin story that hasn't been done to death-thank god Ironman was never Spiderman so his origin was never the stiff of endless spoofs and rip offs. Best of all I love the characters. All of the characters are there and they are real. Sure there is slight modification for the real world but they are there and you care about them- so much so that the action almost seems like an intrusion into the rest of the film. I especially liked Jeff Bridges as Obediah Stane. At last he gives a real performance and not one of his lispy toss off appearances of late. Here we have a wonderful evil man.I don't want to spoil it by saying too much...If I have any complaints- and there are two- its first that the film is almost too breezy. Its moves like the wind from start to finish with Robert Downey giving one hell of a central performance (He holds it all together). However the problem is that the meat seems to be missing-or at least invisible. Yes I know its not needed but I would have loved to have seen more of the back stories and subplots hinted at and that bleed off the screen. I love that the world and the people all exist outside the film-however I wished we could have seen more(though I know that would have slowed or killed the flow of the film). My second complaint is that the effects are at times too CGI. Its not so much the look- but the weight-when we see the later suits in action they don't have a real world weight. Its a nit pick, but it bothered me that such a wonderfully fun film missed something so tiny.Still I loved it- 9 out of 10 on the pure fun scale. No it ain't high art but it is a great thrill ride-and as for the post credits bit- Oh yea I'm there.",9,1,3,4 May 2008
Casino Royale," Destined to be a classic
","Bond is back and he's kicking butt.The best Bond in years, this is a no nonsense approach thats more or less realistic, certainly the most realistic of all Bond films yet produced (except for maybe the first hour of Die Another Day and a good chunk of For Your Eyes Only). This is the Bond of the books, mean and nasty and doing what ever it takes.The plot has the recently appointed 007 going after a terrorist organization. Bond follows the money and he soon finds himself in the middle of a high stakes poker game where the terrorist money man is trying desperately to win back the money he's lost gambling. Along the way there is a great deal of brutal in your face action as Bond kills or destroys anything that gets in his way. Its more amazing than the action in most of the last five or six films because the film is so close to real so you actually feel more danger, this could happen while an invisible car probably won't Its edge of your seat material, with Daniel Craig turning in a dynamite performance as Bond.If the film has any real flaw its that its too long. Running almost two and a half hours the film stalls after the poker game and Bond's capture. There is a dead spot, more a false ending, before the finale in Venice, which while exciting and one of the great movie action scenes, seems some how anti climatic. Its not a fatal flaw, but if you're like me you'll reach this one point and then be ready for the exit. I looked at my watch and found that there was still 25 minutes to go.If you're an action fan or Bond fan see this movie. Its destined to be a classic.",8,3,7,19 November 2006
Toy Story 3," This didn't work for me until the very end
","Dark story of Andy going to college and the toys in danger of being thrown out or given away.I won't go into the details of the plot because odds are you already know it. Basically all thats left is for me to take a stand on the small side of people who don't like the film. Beautifully animated with several nice set pieces, the film emotionally and character wise didn't work for me. The film, for what ever reason just seems terribly wrong. Its not the dark tone of the film that bothers me, except perhaps that the people at Pixar seem intent on making this black and bittersweet. I know part of th problem is that several of the characters, especially Woody, seem to have been shipped in from another film. How did Woody end up so psycho? I don't know.I don't see the point of ripping the film apart since odds are you're going to love this. Personally I think this is probably Pixars biggest mistake, but then again thats just my opinion.",3,12,67,4 July 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Better story, less laughs and seeming borrowed animation make this merely an okay film
","No I did not see this in 3D. Frankly other than depth I didn't see the reason why they bothered other than to get some extra shekels. the plot has Ray Romano and Queen Latifah expecting a baby mammoth, Denis Leary going through a midlife crisis after losing a step in the hunt and John Leguizamo wanting to belong somewhere and feeling left out. Leguizamo happens upon 3 eggs which hatch into baby T-Rex's which he tries to raise until the mother comes and the quartet , babies and Leguizamo end up going back to a lost world of dinosaurs. Latifah , Romano and Leary give chase and end up hooking up with a crazed Simon Pegg. More sound plot wise the film is less funny than the earlier entries and in a world of diminishing returns I liked it even less than the earlier films which I really didn't like. Its a good looking film but at the same time the jungle seems strangely low rent and not up to the background design of the earlier films. I also was disappointed in that several characters design and animation seem to have been lifted from films like Open Season, The Wild and Madagascar to the point I'm wondering if animation department has raided other studios on a large level (worse the 'borrowed animation' seems to be not as good as the rest of the film, which is why I noticed it) can you tell I have problems? Not my cup of tea. Since it does have moments I think it might be worth a shot if you wait for DVD or cable so lots of people can see it for a small amount of money.",5,1,3,19 July 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," I couldn't stay to the end-its too many story lines that go nowhere-even if you know the history
","I can't really comment on the film. I abandoned it some 45 minutes in. As good as it looks and as good as the performing is I simply could not get into the film. The problem for me is entirely in the writing which seems to keep its various story lines separate even when they are converging. The trouble with Spain, Mary Queen of Scots, Walter Raleigh and her playing off of suitors never blended for me. I know they were one story but here its seems as though a three plus hour mini-series was cut apart for theatrical release. All the ingredients are there in their bowls but they are still waiting to be mixed. I'll try it again down the line, but for now I simply don't have the patience.",4,3,4,5 January 2008
Identity," Let no one tell you anything about this movie-just go see it
",Watched this lovely little film with Ray Liotta and John Cusack to night. Think Ten Little Indians and then let the story wander.This is a wonderful little thriller that is better the less you know about it. The plot of a group of people being stranded at a motel during a rain storm is the starting point of a tale that should end about two minutes before it does.(The last two minutes are stupid fill in the blanks stuff its not needed and could be considered almost a cop out) I would love to tell you whats going on but I think the less you know the better it is. Although I am looking forward to seeing it again because its a good thriller even if I told you everything.Forgive me this is a really good movie that I want to discuss with someone who's seen it simply because there is so much to love and its so well made despite the bumps in the road. I will have to corner people in my office and chat the movie up....If you like thrillers see this movie.Three and a half stars how good is it? I stopped sorting photos to watch this baby....,8,1,3,19 January 2008
Beowulf," See it in big screen 3D or not at all
","Wildly uneven on every level retelling of the 'classic' poem.I saw this first in 2D and the following week in 3D. I really hated it in 2D I liked it more in 3D If you must see this see it in 3D. The action set pieces, 3 battles with Grendel, the sea monsters and the dragon castle attack are spectacular (though the Grendel attacks are kind of dull). The 3D viewing will explain why you have a constant moving of the camera-endless tracking shots that serve no real purpose except make you go 'ooo and ah' in 3D. It will also explain why you have these really bad perspective shots like a sentry's lance in your face. The 50's and 80's 3D craze had some odd shots but nothing as awkward (in 2D) as those in this film.The script is uneven. There are lots of moments of hysterical satire and hysterically bad lines of dialog (this is a movie you can laugh at and with). When the film isn't in motion the film often stalls in long long winded scenes of dialog that are just plain awful.(And yes it is possible to know what Neil Gaiman wrote, especially if you've read his paycheck comics and watched his earlier film adventures). Clearly the script was suppose to be a joke, but Zemekis didn't seem to notice and filmed it straight removing much of the humor along the way.And thats the problem. Zemekis insistence on doing this as motion capture because 'it would cost too much as a live action film' is what ruins the subtleties the script might have had (and is pure horse hockey since all monster and action stuff would have been CGI anyway). First off the most of the character animation sucks. The characters are pasty faced non-emotive automatons that go threw the motions. I felt I was watching the road company of the background characters from Shrek 3. The technique pretty much prevents any sort of real performance with the exception of Ray Winstone and Anthony Hopkins.(John Malkovich gives a performance but its so bizarre as to classified as a knowing joke). Robin Wright Penn's character-vital to the story- is so stiff (in every sense of the word) that it looks embalmed. The animation is often worse than any big budget computer game, and worse than whats coming out of Japan or out of many film studios effect houses.Another major problem (especially in 2D where the visuals don't distract you from the many flaws) is the damned choral score which is repetitive to the point of making you want to commit suicide. Its ten times worse than any video game ear worm you've ever heard and been scared by.There are some great sequences as I said. the action scenes are spectacular with Beowulf's sea battle and dragon battle being the very very bloody highlights. They are the reasons the film might have a life on DVD and cable, since flat or 3D they are way cool.Two other points I think I should mention.First clearly there is something wrong when this film is PG13 and Tekkonkinkreet is R. Grendel is far more bloody and sexually (both straight and gay) in your face that the animated film from Japan.If you want to see the effect of a big studio on the ratings board this is it. Honestly many 'bloody' horror films don't have this much blood. The fights in this film are bloody and disgusting and make you wonder about the ratings board.(This is a really really bloody movie) Secondly anyone else but me feel that Grendel is throw back to the old days where mentally or physically handicapped people were to be locked up in the attic and feared because they were different? Come on strip away the monstrous size and fact that by the time we meet him, Grendel has gone insane from being locked in a cave, he is a 'special needs' child gone bad. Its sad.When I saw this is 3D I was less critical because of the visual effects but it still didn't make it really a batter film, just one where the flash hides the flaws. So as a 3D film the effects will make the action scenes enough of a thrill ride to get past the deadly slow talky bits-so it 6 out 10 as 3D As a 2D film where nothing is in your face and it all looks odd 3 to 4 out of 10, with a couple of great action scenes that are great regardless of flat or multi dimensional. Unfortunately the talky bits make it very tough going with out the gee whiz of the 3D.Lastly, this and the 3D process are being hailed by some as the future of movies; If this is the future of movies we all deserve to go blind.",3,2,4,5 January 2008
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Good film seems more Wes Anderson and less Roald Dahl
","Wes Anderson takes a Rolad Dahl film and makes it his own. There is no getting around it this is an Anderson film except animated. If you don't like Anderson's style then just stay away. If you do, then give it a shot. The plot has George Clooney's Fox settling down with Meyrl Streep when she is pregnant. Years later he's a columnist for a newspaper and is feeling middle aged. He moves his family into a new house and despite promising his wife never to steal chickens again, he begins to go back to his old ways which precipitates a war with the three biggest farmers in the country. An amusing film filled with angst and humor and Anderson's skewed view of life. If Anderson sold this as a kids film he has proved once again how dense the people in Hollywood really are since the vast majority of this film would go over most kid's heads. I like the film but I don't see it as the be all and end all, certainly I wouldn't put as the front runner for this years animated Oscar. My problems with the film stem from the films rambling nature which took up much of the first half. Once the war starts the film seems to settle down, though to me the ending, which was cribbed from Dahl's notes seems an after thought. I do like that Clooney's lead is very fallible, but at the same time he is kind of a jerk and more than once I wanted to shout at the screen questions about why everyone was still around him. Reservations aside this is very much worth seeing if you like Anderson's style.",6,0,1,28 December 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," Poor plot almost does in some great action set pieces
","(Spoiler alert-This comment has numerous spoilers) If this were titled like the last one I'd say this was 'Die Hard without a Plot'Disappointing go round for John McClane has good performances, spectacular action and a plot that makes no real sense.The plot has someone hacking into the US government computers. The feds suspect something is up and they try to bring in known hackers who could do this. At the same time some is killing off the same hackers. McClane is sent to pick up a hacker (He's a NYC cop who's in NJ looking for his daughter-just don't ask) and bring him Washington. Of course he gets there as the killers do so we have the first of many action sequences.McClane is tracked by the bad guys-please don't ask- and delivers the kid to the FBI. The kid is then sent off for questioning- but he recognizes the voice of the woman who hired him to write a code breaking program on the radio and we get another set piece.What follows is McClane and hacker trying to stay alive and stop a bunch of 'terrorists' who want to shut down everything in a 'fire sale' so named because everything must go-everything run by computer is to be shut down. Of course we think its terrorists, but no its for revenge---well maybe not maybe its for the money.(Don't ask).The scale of whats going on is frightening except we don't really see that much of it, total chaos is reduced to some crowds and a few parked cars. Worse what the bad guys are doing makes no sense especially since its clear from some statements that they really didn't have to shut the whole country down. Even worse is the fact that for the most part all of the villains- Maggie Q excepted- are cartoon cut outs-they seem to be as McClane jokes, from 1-800 henchmen. Even the boss of bosses just sorts of wanders around a control room doing---nothing. He has no stature like Jeremy Irons or Alan Rickman or William Sadler. A challenge for McClane? Oh please. Only in the last 20 minutes or so does he really begin to measure up- but then again he's pretty much put in his place by McClane's daughter (he was beaten by a girl?).This should have been a classic movie. Hell the action is there. The set pieces are spectacular with several scenes not in the trailers that make you go 'WOW'. This is a movie that ups the action ante for all films to come. I just wish it had a solid plot instead of a piece of embalmed vermicelli to hang all of these excellent explosions on.If you are an action fan you will want to see this movie, though maybe not at 10 bucks a head in the movies.",6,1,6,3 July 2007
The Ringer," Way better then you think it is
","Johnnie Knoxville tries to fix the Special Olympics by pretending to be handicapped. The idea is that he'll pretend to be mentally handicapped so money can be won to help a friend with no insurance and his dad who's in debt to the mob.Clever offbeat the film just sort of misses despite being funny and touching. What can I say Johnny Knoxville has made a film that would seem to be his typical offensive material however it's so much better than you think it is. To be certain this won't win awards but it will pass the time and make you laugh, and what more could you ask for? 6 out of 10",6,2,2,28 December 2008
Am√©lie," Style Over Substance
","The story of Amelie will either grab you or it won't. Certainly this is one of the greatest looking films, with a witty frantic style that is a pleasure to look at simply because there is so much to look at. Those wanting to study how to make a film from a visual stand point should put this on the list of films to study.The story is a mixed bag. I know many people who have watched this film and fell in love with its quirky romance and view of life. I on the other hand was pained from the get go, finding its attempts at humor severely lacking in everything even in the ability to even make me crack a smile. To me it wants to be applauded for being off center instead of being good.Try it, you may like it, or you maybe like me and wonder what all the shouting is about.",5,7,13,24 April 2004
Munich," Okay but not great retelling of the aftermath of the Munich Olympic tragedy
","This is a movie that looks and feels unlike any other Steven Spielberg film. Its a well made and mostly well acted story about the Israeli hit squad sent out to kill the plotters of the terrorist attack at the 1972 Olympics. The problem for me was that I was never emotionally engaged except when we see the recreation of the attack. I never really felt any connection to any of the Israeli agents taking revenge. A large part of the problem is that Eric Bana seems completely out of place in the film. He's much taller and much too good looking not to stand out in a crowd, which struck me as odd since he was chosen to lead the team in part because he didn't look Jewish. Bana also seemed to have only one expression through most of the movie and I wondered whether he was actually Buster Keaton in disguise. This isn't to say the film is a bad movie, its not, Its just not a particularly engaging one. For my money I would rather see the 1986 version of the same story The Sword of Gideon, or better yet the excellent documentary One Day in September again since at least I would actually feel some connection to the events rather than just an admiration for the film making skill.",6,11,21,3 January 2006
Get Him to the Greek," The uneven nature of the film makes this disappointing
","Nerdy fan boy is assigned to get his idol to the Greek Theater in LA in 72 hours for a comeback concert. Much soul searching and mirth, make it so a maudlin times ensue.Wildly uneven film wants to be both serious and twistedly funny with the results being an odd mix of funny, touching and uncomfortable (I didn't need the threesome). Mostly the various tones grate on each other to such a degree that the film doesn't amount to very much. Russell Brand is alternately on target and empty as the rock star, which I think is positive because normally annoys me and that he can actually act (in fits and starts) surprised me. I like bits but over all its a near miss.",6,2,6,27 July 2010
300," Great visuals almost hide a a lack of story and connection to reality
","Wildly historically inaccurate story of the battle of Thermopylae, I'll let other people pick on it for its tenuous connection to reality.How is it as a movie? Its tough to say accurately. Bear with me this is hard to explain.The film is for the most part hysterically funny with its over the top, over cooked dialog. Its a real scream, with every sentence a pronouncement, or seeming pronouncement of some grand sort or another. The performances are pretty much on par with the over done dialog, some of which is lifted from Frank Miller's graphic novel (which ultimately is just as laughable as this movie). The way things unfold are so...well actually at a certain point things stop unfolding and it just becomes a battle, an hour long battle with a rhino and some elephants and a monster out of a B-horror movie and a hunchback. None of it is connected to reality, but it looks good.Yes this movie is pure eye candy. Almost every shot is visually stunning. There are shots which will be on posters for decades to come. Its certain to get technical Oscar noms-and probably wins- for photography and art direction. The visuals are the reason to see this film. Then again after about fifteen minutes of this eye candy overload you realize that there isn't much,if anything beyond it. Lets face it they've gutted the story and reduced it down to Spartans vs the Persians (with no real context as to the events) and made most characters likable cardboard cutouts, leaving you nothing to do but watch the pretty pictures. Its enjoyable, but pretty empty, like a a ride on the best looking amusement park ride you've ever seen- only its a minute long ride after a three hour wait, or finding out your date for the evening has the IQ of a gnat and is incapable of any sort of intelligent speech . Over and over, especially towards the end I had to keep asking, is that all there is? It is watchable. Its just not very satisfying (especially if you know the real story, which is oh so much more harrowing and heartbreaking).I saw it, great, can I see something else now?",5,12,19,3 September 2007
Fantastic Four," Too much talk in this less than fantastic movie (some non specific thoughts)
","I've seen the new Fantastic Four movie and all I can say is that there are things that are right and things that are not. It doesn't suck, but it is rather dull... at times. It could have been sooooo much better.Its the origin plus a battle with a Victor von Doom, who goes into space with them and who may or may not have been effected by the same storm (There's a line late in the movie saying that Doom used a machine built by Reed to get his powers.) Its the story of how they deal with their powers and how Doom tries to kill them so he can begin to take over the world. Its a reasonable rewrite of the origin story with the addition of, and complete rethink of the Doom character. (I don't think Doom really works) Mostly the movie is okay, just. The film suffers the fate of most first super hero movies, its too damn talky and not enough action. In first films the plot has to go from explaining where their characters came from into an adventure, unfortunately the adventure is either given too little time by being squashed at the end, or it just gets lost. Here its a bit of both.Actually here the plot is a re-tread of the first Spiderman film, with only one action sequence actually fitting logically into the plot, thats the bridge rescue. This is the FF in action from the comics and a nice piece of film making. (Never mind that there would be all sorts of real world problems as the result of it...or actually any of the other battles. This is the first film in a while where the destruction would most likely bring fear and lawsuits, not toy deals. New Yorkers would be suing their butts off, this is not Spidey saving a trainload of people) If you think about it its the only time in the film where the action actually makes sense. The long final battle with Doom makes almost no sense plot-wise since the twists to get there seem forced.The action sequences are spectacular and well done. The film gets that right. The problem is that there are very few real exciting pieces. Mostly we have talk, lots of talk and that kills the film. The talk is not as awful as I thought it would be, but its still not all that great. The problem is that there is too much. In the comic you've always had a nice mix of action and talk. Here its mostly talk. Space sequence(which really isn't action as such), bridge sequence, final sequence and I think one other, not including the bits of in fighting) Its doesn't suck but its not what it should have/could have been. Yea the action is nice on the big screen but you'll not be able to zap through the dull parts. I'd wait for DVD.",5,0,2,17 July 2005
Sin City," Laughably Bad, but Perfect Comic Adaptation
","This is a perfect adaptation of several of Frank Miller's Sin City stories. Filmed to look exactly precisely like the panels of the comic book where everything is BLACK or WHITE except for the occasional red, blue, or yellow, exactly like in the comic. The dialog is lifted word for word from the comic and sold in noir-ish tones we associate with the genre.After five minutes you quickly realize that its all visual form over substance, and that there is little behind the trick of exact duplication. The narration, like much of the narration in the pulp novels its paying homage to, is purple and laughable when spoken out loud. The dialog is equally ludicrous. None of it even remotely real. I was in fits of uncontrolled laughter as the 'serious' lines of prose were spewed out over mostly unremarkable images.I know there is a tinge of humor to the source but on screen it comes off as something to laugh AT not with. Yes, it all matches the comic exactly, but to what end? What is the purpose of this exactitude? Wouldn't it have been better to simply film the panels and have the actors speak the lines? Its all little more than a live action Clutch Cargo since there is no life on screen in what is little more than posed actors recreating the static shots of the comic. This is a ground breaking visual style? Many people in discussing the film have mentioned the violence and how 'if it had been in color' it would have been unbearable. I think it would have looked equally silly. Actually most of this movie would have looked very silly and dumb in color.The performances, especially Mickey Rourke as Marv (Oscar nom?)are excellent, but they are saddled with such unreal material that their earnestness comes off making it all look even more ridiculous.This is simply one of the most over-hyped films in many years. Its a live action comic book for people who've forgotten how to read.",1,250,443,10 April 2005
The Ugly Truth," Vulgar misfire almost succeeds in being a look at what men and women really want
","Producer of a local news program is forced to take on a piggish cable TV host when her ratings fall. He's supposedly an expert in what men and women really want and his inflammatory style is ratings grabber. She's both horrified and charmed. Can romance be too far away? Low brow comedy that is trying to be more than it is. Give the film points for trying to deal with men and women's baser instincts but take a few away for not always leaving the sewer. In all honesty my attitude has changed since I saw the film three or four days ago. Initially I thought this was an occasionally funny but terribly foul mouthed film was a complete failure. Since then, in the process of talking and thinking about the film I find that the film has grown a bit on me. I don't think the film is the total disaster I first thought. Now I find it to be more an foul mouthed misfire that doesn't quite work. Personally I find it interesting that any Hollywood film is dealing with the battle between high brow and low brow, especially when the whole industry is rapidly dumbing itself down. Lets face it the industry is moving more and more toward the brainless and enforcing the baser stereotypes of men and women. Here is a film about that battle. Thinking about the film after the fact I still think the humor only occasionally works, but I don't think its as mindless as I first thought. Clearly there is, or was something to the material that drew its stars to it other than the vulgarity, and I think if one looks at the finished film I think some of that is still there. Is that a thumbs up recommendation, no, but its not a total pan. I don't think you should pay 12 bucks to see it (I'm still stinging from that bad move) but I do think that if you see this on cable with a beverage of your choice you might enjoy it in a Neanderthal sort of way.",4,3,8,10 August 2009
Coach Carter," Above average feel good movie
","The story of a coach who benches his team for bad grades could have been a disaster in the making. However thanks to a fine performance by Samuel Jackson this is a movie that is really alive with people and not clich√©d.The coach wants his team to be more than just players. Basketball is a privilege which he feels that have to earn, by dressing right, behaving right and by getting good grades. To him basketball is more than the only thing in life. This of course causes a good many problems.This was much better than I expected and I made it all the way through it although walking in I thought I might walk out. Its gripped me more than many recent films which is saying a good deal. If I had a complaint is that it is just a bit long, but thats a minor complaint.See this movie.",7,0,2,13 February 2005
Moon," A good solid pulp science fiction film but I don't think its the next great all time classic
","Directed by Duncan Jones, who is the son of David Bowie, this film has been hailed as the next coming of the great SCIFI God. Its been compared and any number of classic films. Much as been made of the fact that the film feels awfully familiar, it borrowing bits of other films looks for its look. I think its familiar because it a place I've been before.The plot has astronaut Sam Rockwell coming to the end of his three year term as the only man on an automated mining base on the far side of the moon. His only companion is Gerty, the computer, voiced by Kevin Spacey.. He dreams of his wife and just wants to get home so that he can see his young daughter. However the isolation is getting to to him and when he wakes up after an accident things have become different.I could tell you more but thats as far as most people writing on the film have taken it, so I will bow to their line in the sand and leave it there (though many who insist that the less you know is better reveal 'too much' by comparing it to a certain now classic film from the early 1980's). They seem to think that what happens after that point is some huge revelation. I don't think so I think what happens, while perfectly in keeping with the story isn't as important as what that sets in motion.I really like this film. Its a good solid pulp science fiction film about a man alone in space. I do not think this is the next 'great' science fiction film. I don't think its revelations are mind blowing. I think its a well thought out film with a great deal to say about man and mankind. I really wish that people would stop placing this film on a pedestal, because it doesn't belong there for the reasons that they are claiming. The film may, some day earn a place on a high but for right now, its the idle chatter of people who really haven't seen too many science fiction films, or if not they aren't versed in the golden age of pulp scifi stories that bled over into the golden days of radio and the early days of television. I kept waiting for the film to hit me with some grand revelation, but it never came. In all honesty it wasn't until the accident and the film got down to doing what it does that I stopped waiting for something the film wasn't and took it for what it is.Don't get me wrong. This is a really good little film, its just not the next big thing.There is much to like about the film. Sam Rockwell is very good in a role that is nicely restrained and not out in left field. Its one several recent performances that have me warming to him and his style. The look of the film, borrowed from films like 2001, Space 1999, Solaris, Outland and others has a nice lived in feel. I love Kevin Spacey's Gerty. I'm going to kind of give a spoiler here and say I like his performance as a sort of anti-Hal 9000. There are moments where he will move you. The plot, when stripped of the hype is actually quite good and it raises all sorts of interesting questions (Which I won't get into since they might reveal late in the game plot points). And while the film does have a couple of plot bumps, nothing is major and the film hangs nicely together.Recommended for anyone wanting a good science fiction yarn. Let the hype go and just go and enjoy it. (Frankly comparing it to things like 2001, Solaris and other great head films is a major mistake since it shrinks your audience who won't go thinking its one thing-as I did- when in fact its something else.)",7,5,10,1 August 2009
Happy Feet," Great first half is spoiled by a contrived second
","What an odd movie.Actually this is two movies, one great and the other just okay.The first half of this film is the story of Mumbles a penguin who can't sing but can dance. This is the source of most of the promos and its what the studio is pushing as what the film is about.Can the penguin find his heart song if he can't sing? Well thats the first half of the movie. The second half of the movie is an odd left turn thats foreshadowed, but doesn't really belong, and thats Mumbles attempts to find the 'aliens' and make them stop taking the fish. Its a weird detour that puts mumbles in a zoo.I really liked the first half of the film. Its an infectious story about finding your place in the world. Sure its been done to death but the characters and the music push this film from run of the mill into something special. Its a great one hour movie.The second half of this film is another story. Its not the second half of the film its a second film tacked on to make up the running time.The problem is that once Mumbles ends up in the zoo everything is contrived. What happens is done just to get to the ending. It doesn't work. I went from loving the movie to liking it. Yes I know I'm being vague but to really explain why it doesn't work would require explaining the ending and thats not fair. Lets just say that they should have stopped at an hour.Story aside this is probably the best animated computer film (technically) I've seen all year. Its amazing. Its simply beautiful to look at and its clear that the animators took great pains to make a visually arresting film. The performances are top notch, with Robin Williams pure joy in two roles. And of course the music is wonderful, with some really nice rearrangements that are so clever it takes you a few minutes to realize what the song is.I highly recommend the first half of this movie. Its magical. The second part has moments, but mostly its contrived nonsense you'll want to push out of your head (though not the ten thousand penguins dancing to Stevie Wonder).Worth a trip to the multiplex if you can ignore the second half.First half is 9 out of 10. The second is 5 out of 10. Split the difference of 7 for IMDb purposes",7,6,10,25 November 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," I liked it I didn't love it
","Probable Oscar nominee didn't float my boat. Its a good film but I don't know whether too many people have told me how great it is or is it not that great and people are simply reacting to the exotic nature of the film, either way it didn't blow my skirt up.This is the story of Jamal who is on the verge of winning 20 million rupees in India's Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Certain this lower class kid must be cheating he's in the police station where some extreme methods are being employed to find out how he's cheating. Insisting that he is not cheating Jamal recounts his life's story with appropriate pauses to explain how he knows the answers.Far from what I expected, I didn't expect the level of violence, this is a good little film. Its the sort of thing where luck, or is it fate, allows you enough information to get ahead. Its the sort of thing designed to make you feel good.As I said I'm not in love with the film. I like it but I'm not in love with it. Perhaps its a little too cute at times (The kid in the poop) and it didn't help that the romance vital to much of the later part of the film didn't feel right to me.As an exercise in film-making its a masterful achievement blending a variety of styles into something uniquely its own. Danny Boyle is quite simply one of the best filmmakers working today one need only look at the last four films he's directed to see the range he has. Its a dizzying, great looking, great sounding film that makes even the squalor of India seem magical. I wish more directors had Boyle's abilities.That said the film didn't click with me. I respect the people who've fallen in love with the film enough to give the film a second go down the line., but for now Its a good film that I don't think is one of the best of the year.(For those, like me who didn't realize this was as violent as it it be warned- There are shootings, clubbings, torture, people set on fire, and nastiness to children. Its not a film for kids, though reviews I've seen made it seem so)",6,19,27,6 January 2009
Donnie Darko," Whats all the shouting about?
","I doubt this is going to help anyone make up their mind about this film. To be honest this isn't really a review but more a commentary on a film that several friends have insisted is one of the great movies of all time. I've tried to come up with something to say about the film, other than its not very good, but have had trouble since I saw it in doing so. To that end I've decided to write about that, about not being able to find the words and why.I finally sat down to watch this film after several years of people grabbing me and insisting I see this film. Some wanted to share the dark 'wondrous' experience others wanted me to take a crack at explaining the film to them. Some where along the way I picked up the directors cut and put it away until recently when I popped it and gave it ago.Its been a week or so since I've seen this film and I'm still wondering what it was I saw. To be certain its a unique vision of strangeness concerning the odd visions of a young man who is haunted by person in a twisted bunny suit urging him to do things in order to save the world. But outside of the strangeness I don't see this as the be all and end all or even the very good movie that some people seem to think the film is. For me this is way way way too long film thats weird for the sake of weird. For me its an angsty young kid trying to deal with change by creating a 'fantasy world' of doom and gloom. What so different about that from real life? Forgive me I just don't care for the film. Its not that I don't get it, but the two plus hour march to the downbeat conclusion was almost too much for me to take. I kept wanting to scream at the film 'get on with it' until I'd realize that I had the DVD controller next to me and I'd scan to the next scene.What is it about this film that draws people in? I can't say. Perhaps I'm the wrong audience for this film, having been raised on the films of David Lynch, Jodorowsky and Bunuel where strange is a way of life not a means of getting your film noticed. Even the ending, which has echoes of other films didn't strike me as anything special.Perhaps if I had stumbled upon this unaware I might have liked it, but mostly I'm left wondering if thats all there is.",3,34,65,11 September 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," By the numbers feel good movie is a bit too by the numbers
","Well made, well intentioned movie about a man who gets custody of his son as his life implodes and he takes an unpaid internship in the hope that it leads to something greater.So sweet it hurts. So manipulative you get whip lash. So obvious you wonder why you're watching. Its a good movie but I felt manipulated. This is the uplifting tale of a man who pulled himself up by his bootstraps to become a success, and it hits all the numbers in a way that seems more like a self empowerment seminar rather than a real movie. Whether this has to do with the fact that the real life counterpart of Will Smith's character does just that I don't know, but it doesn't make for completely gripping viewing since odds are you know how its going to come out.I don't hate the movie, its not bad, but jeeze give me a chance to connect on my own with out flipping the clich√© switches (how many clich√©s can a real life story have?.)",5,0,2,16 September 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Great Action but See the First One First
","Not having seen the first film with Matt Damon I felt more than a bit lost, but its got great action.The chase at the end in the tunnel beats I Robot's hands down.No, its not great, but for your bang for your buck level is very high. This is one of the best films this summer.Honestly this film could be longer, there are holes in the plot, granted you don't see them until after the fact.See this film if you want slightly intelligent mindless fun.8 out of 10.",7,2,6,29 July 2004
The Proposal," As formula as a movie can get and still be enjoyable
","Bitch on wheels boss needs her assistant to marry her so she can stay in the United States. He agrees and takes her home to meet his parents and to get married and then they somehow begin to fall in love. Good romantic comedy is the sort of film that follows the well worn path of all its predecessors to the point that there is no surprises. Its a well made formula, a tried and true instant recipe and it tastes pretty good, even if its got the aftertaste of being a bit too packaged. Honestly you're going to know if you like this going in or not. Its self selecting. The only downside is whether Sandra Bullock's character as the bitchy boss grates against your sensibilities. I wasn't completely thrilled with her and I think it lessened my enjoyment. Worth a shot, definitely a date movie.",7,1,6,19 July 2009
Shark Tale," Great cast done in by rotten script and direction
","This movie is almost so bad it hurts. You hurt because your body goes stiff from holding a confused look on your face for way too long your muscles freeze up.This 'Its okay to be who you are' tale is one of the most uneven films in memory. A sterling cast is let down by script that is obvious, soon to date, and not funny, as well as direction that hammers home every single point. Things that should put you on the floor with laughter have you shaking your head at how unfunny they are. Only the bits with Marty Scorsese have any real punch and are funny from start to finish (And all of his scenes with De Niro are classic).Yes, the animation is fantastic. The work on De Niro's Don Lino is simply some of the best character animation ever put on screen and will be a yard stick for years to come. And yes, there are some funny bits, but they operate in a vacuum and so fail to provoke any real laughter.If you must see this wait for video, or better cable. This is a car wreck.3 out of 10.",3,3,9,3 October 2004
Cinderella Man," Painfully slow first hour weakens a very good Depression era drama
","This is the story of Jim Braddock a 'washed up' fighter and one time championship contender who manages to turn a fluke chance into something more. Its a rousing story about a man who although appears to have hit bottom manages to pull himself up again for the sake of his family.Word has this as an early contender for numerous Oscars, unfortunately audiences have yet to find this film, which as of this writing is disappearing from theaters. Having seen the film I can understand why people are staying away from this screenings, its badly paced and at two and a half hours it seems twice that.(This will play better on cable and DVD) This isn't to say that its a bad film, its not, its just that the film takes about an hour before it shows any real signs of life. Its not the fault of the actors, who are pretty much excellent across the board. You can't really blame the director, Ron Howard, either since this is a beautifully made film. The fight scenes are simply some of the best ever put on the screen. The fault is squarely on the script which takes forever to get where its going. Its a solid hour of how bad life is in the Depression and how hard it is for Braddock to support his family. It just seems to go on and on and on. Later in the film the seems to repeat the same notes again and again as if to show how far Braddock has risen. I got the point early and didn't need to be reminded over and over. I 'm of the opinion that you could probably remove thirty minutes out of this with out losing anything.I must say that this is a very good film once it gets moving and absolutely worth seeing, though its probably going to play better sitting on your couch where you can stretch out during the opening slow bits.Seven out of ten.(really seven and a half)",7,0,2,21 June 2005
Valkyrie," If only I could have forgotten how it was going to end I would have thought this one of the best of the year
","Bryan Singers film about the plot to kill Hitler is a very good one. (SPOILERS AHEAD)Wonderfully acted, especially when it gets going, it has one of the best ensemble casts I've seen. This is beautiful to look at with a real sense of being in the Nazi world. And it is at times a taut film about a plot to kill the Fuhrer (I know you can all here the 'but' coming, so I won't disappoint you) BUT the film has one large problem, we know how it turns out.Forgive me for saying that unless you really don't know your history you know the plan fails and everyone dies. Short of them rewriting history there is one and only one way this can go, and its not really a happy one. This doesn't mean there is no tension, there is, it just means there are no surprises except in the details. For me the films inability to transcend the fact we know it ends badly keeps it from being a being a great film and instead making it only a good one. Its is possible to make a great film about a failed event, one need only look at Khartoum or the Alamo to see two films that hold you in such away that you forget the ending. Don't get me wrong its a good film, I just wish they had made me forget the ending at the start.(Counter point recent films where I knew the ending and didn't care or forgot it in the flow: Milk, Che, Frost/Nixon)",7,13,18,6 January 2009
The Soloist," Stunning performances are done in by directorial touches that under cut the magic
","After a spill on a bicycle a recuperating Steve Lopez heres music playing on the street and makes the acquaintance of Nathaniel Ayers, a homeless man and musical genius, who is playing music on a two string violin. In the course of writing about Ayers for his LA paper Lopez a friendship forms between the two men that changes both of them.Uneven based on a true story tale about how friendship can alter the way we behave and see the world. The problem is that there have been so many stories like this that some of it comes off as clich√©d. What isn't clich√© is the performances and the very real bond between Robert Downey as Lopez and and Jamie Fox as Ayers.Say what you will when the pair are on screen together there is a good chance that the film will transcend any other problems it maybe having.Let me try to explain where the problems in the film come from. There is this moment where Lopez brings Ayers a cello, his original instrument of choice. Lopez wants his friend to go to a shelter to play the instrument but he refuses. They argue and Lopez allows Ayers to play the cello one time before taking to the shelter. Ayers begins to play... and magic happens.As the music happens the camera focuses on the faces of the two men and from the facial expressions alone we know the magic of music. No words, no images are needed beyond that. Unfortunately director Joe Wright doesn't trust the images and he goes for the stereotypical birds flying to illustrate what we are seeing in the faces of the two men. In another seen we see music as color. Why? Why go for the easy way out when everything he needed to do was just show the faces. For me the film's spell gets broken each time and just as I started to well up I groaned in annoyance. There are several instances where this happens, where Wright goes for the the 'clich√©'.(The flashback scenes of Ayers early life seems to be all clich√©.) This isn't to say the film is bad. Its not. Its one of those annoying 'solidly good films that really should be a great one'. I kept watching because the film repeatedly soars, unfortunately it also usually makes a bone headed choice that drops it down a point or two. Personally I think the film is worth a look especially if you are a fan of the two leads or just like great acting.Somewhere over 6 out of 10 over all, with moments that are way above it.",6,2,4,26 April 2009
Dodgeball," Funny comedy with a few bumps
","I delayed for a long time in watching Dodgeball because I despise Ben Stiller with an unnatural passion. While I think he's fine as a regular actor I find any and all of his attempts at comedic acting unbearable. I have to say that this was a major loss on my part because this is a funny funny movie.This is the typical outcasts against bullies stories but with gyms and dodgeballs. Its great fun and the cast is mostly fine, and Rip Torn standing out as the old salt dodgeball expert.What more can I say, you know the drill. rent the DVD and have a good time.",7,0,0,24 October 2004
Law Abiding Citizen," If you except this operates in its own little world you'll have a good time
","Gerard Butler stars as a man who's wife and daughter are killed by home invaders. He survives the attack, but when its time to go to trial, the self centered prosecutor, Jamie Foxx, decides that a trial isn't in the best interest of the case and pleas it out with the result that the real monster of the invaders essentially walks. Butler then conspires to get revenge not only on the invaders but everyone in the system that allowed justice not to be served.Taking it on its own terms, this is a film that operates in its own twisted little world, this is a very good revenge thriller. What sets the film apart from every other Death Wish style thriller is Butler is under arrest at the time the really big fireworks take place. The fact that he is alone in his cell is what frustrates everyone in the film and makes for exciting viewing for the audience.Lets be real, this isn't a great film. It is a very good one. The problem with the film is its operating in its own world where things happen because they are dramatically exciting rather then they make sense dramatically or even make the film remotely real world like. The more you think about the film the more problems you will find. (I also find the ending seems to have come in from another movie, but by the time it happens I had given up any hope of logic and reason.) I like the film. Its a good mindless popcorn film. Unlikely to win any awards I do think this will end up in semi heavy rotation on cable, at least for a while.",7,2,5,25 October 2009
Up in the Air," Good but profoundly sad story of a man who just travels
","(SPOILERS- I talk in a roundabout way about the ending) The co-front runner (with Hurt Locker) for the Best Picture Oscar this year concerns a man who flies around the country and fires people for a living. He meets and begins a relationship with a woman who also flies the country. Meanwhile his job maybe changing as a young hot shot has come up with a way to fire people via video conferencing.I found this to be a good but not really great film. I know it wasn't quite what I expected going in. Certainly I didn't expect to find the film so incredibly sad. George Clooney's character is a very sad person. He's incredibly happy that he lives out of suitcases and simply travels from place to place., or so he thinks. And its kind of heart warming to see how he comes around but that makes the ending so much more sad. As the film ended I kind of wanted to step into traffic.I'm kind of at a loss to to figure out why the film ends as it does, what is the point? What is the film trying to say? That we shouldn't try to move out of out cocoons? That perhaps we are all better off just traveling? Maybe that we should go with our first instincts and never know if there is anything better out there? I'm not sure. Sure Clooney is a bit of a jerk at the start but its also a defense. As the film goes on and Clooney's defenses are stripped away he finds himself not really better off, but more empty and much more aware of what he is missing. Its like the world showed him everything he could have and then took it all away. It depressed me. Sure life is cruel but even karmicly Clooney doesn't deserve what he gets.I know the fine line between comedy and tragedy.As I said I'm at a loss to explain it and I think director Jason Reitman is too.Its a good film, its just not a great one.",6,5,10,10 January 2010
Atonement," An okay film that clearly has been designed to win Oscars
","Tragic story of a lie told and the pain and heartbreak it causes as Briony, a 13 year old girl, who sets things in motion when jealousy causes her to frame her sister's lover for a terrible act.Well made and well acted story is exactly the sort of film that Oscar loves. Every thing in the film is pretty much picture perfect in ways that only movies can be. I was so aware of the art and artifice that I was never really engaged (even if there were a reason for it its too perfect). The early sequences among the idle rich kept me distant. I did connect to Robbie, played by James McAvoy, but he's the working class stiff in love with the bosses daughter. Keira Knightley is ravishing as Cecilia, Briony's older sister and I could feel her passion for her lover, however I began to lose patience with her performance since it often consisted of the bold acting choice of smoking a cigarette. While not as bad as Natalie Portman in Closer, I should remember the person and not the cigarette.Not a bad film, I just don't think it scales the heights that place it among the best of the year on any level other than a technical. Honestly I should have been crying at the end instead of going being ready to move on to the next thing.6 out of 10 for IMDb purposes 5.5 in actuality)",6,4,9,12 January 2008
The Island," Uninteresting retread marks Michael Bay's total creative collapse
","Michael Bay's films have been on a decline pretty much since he's started making films. After Bad Boys they've all decreased in quality. Sure Armegeddon is a guilty pleasure but its a dumb movie. Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys 2 exist for the action sequences. The Island however has no reason to exist since even the action is unexciting.The plot starts out as on odd mix of Logan's Run and Soylent Green before turning into just another twisty chase movie. The problem is that there is nothing we haven't seen before. And while there are a few interesting bumps, they are the exception to a very dull movie.I blame this on Michael Bay, a director who it seems has a limited palate. His use of filters and quick cuts and very precise action sequences has been done to death by Hollywood and especially by Bay himself. Once our two stars escape and end up in the city I began to feel I had seen it all before. I could sense what the next set up would be and which way the plot would twist. Worse the normally exciting action sequence that Bay puts together fall flat. THere is no sense of rhythm, and the normally quick paced Bay somehow slows everything down to a very dull point, or he seems to. Cars are crashing before me and I want to hit the fast forward. Even here in the action sequences Bay repeats himself. Its awful. Actually its just dull.This is a lavishly produced film thats just no fun to watch. I can't recommend it. Maybe it will be better on TV or cable but in the theater this was an endurance test I never want to take again.",3,6,19,3 August 2005
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Funny NASCAR comedy is probably Wil Ferrell's best film
","Funny NASCAR comedy charts the course of Ricky Bobby, a man who only knows how to drive fast.I do not, as a rule, like Will Ferrell, and I dislike NASCAR but I found this movie very funny. The best of Ferrell's starring vehicles this movie manages to make fun of everyone and everything. On the laugh meter its probably closer to an 8 than the six I've given it, and if thats what you're looking this is your movie. However I have some reservations about the film that kept me from enjoying it completely. I dislike that pretty much every character is as stupid as a stick. There is no characters rather caricatures which would be fine except it becomes jarring when the characters meet real people. This also has to be the film with the greatest amount of product placement in history. Granted the nature of racing is to have little ads everywhere but this film drags it into the peoples 'real lives' its distracting.That said this is a very funny movie and perfect for those wanting to laugh away a rained out race day.",6,1,5,23 September 2006
