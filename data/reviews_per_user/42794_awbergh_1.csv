Scarface," Absurd parody
","Tell someone to imitate an absurdly criminal Latino, and he might turn up like Al Pacino in this terrible parody of a splatter movie. But this goes on for hours in drug trafficking Florida, a business since shown to us with so much more elegance and light-handedness in TV's Miami Vice. Probably the worst caper since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Could be a promotional video paid by the local drug lords to get poor immigrant foot soldiers into the trade. Leave the barrio son, come to Miami and have just as much fun as the hookers on Hollywood Avenue in 'Pretty woman'. Pick a bikini girl of your dreams. All of them Nordic blondes. The beachfront is full of them, just looking for the worst looking creeps the Cuban prison system might produce. To share the life with in his lush home, a one just slightly smaller than the Versailles. All you have to do is killing as many as you can. No small wonder the video version of this film was an absolute hit among the third world young in Sweden's thriving immigrant ghettos! Who said hate can't get you to the top!?",1,25,53,4 May 2008
