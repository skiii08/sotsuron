Captain Phillips," A face is given to the seldom news figures of Somali pirates, and the film leaves you wondering who is the real victim.
","This is another one of those films I skipped while it was in theaters since, honestly, I wasn't really looking for a film which would have had a one dimensional African, specifically Somalian, villain the same way the Russians and Chinese have been villains in action movies for decades. But, with Tom Hanks in the film and there being praise for co- star Barkhad Abdi, I gave into temptation. And honestly, while Hanks may have been the main draw, I left a bigger fan of Abdi's.Characters & StoryThe focus of the movie is Richard Phillips (played by Tom Hanks) who is an America ship captain, who is working around the horn of Africa, and meets a young Abduwali Muse (played by Barkhad Abdi) who meet in less than cordial circumstances due to Muse being a pirate trying to take over Phillips' ship. However, despite him coming off as a bad guy, Muse seemingly is a victim of circumstance. Where he lives there isn't any such thing as social mobility and the effects of globalization has taken a toll on any type of life he could have. Fishing can't really be done for the larger, and financially more powerful, nations have basically wiped that option, and being that his area is dominated, and controlled, by an unseen organization that harasses Muse's village, the only option is to be a pirate to make money and keep his people fed and safe. But, when these two meet, though Muse tries to be as nice as possible. He even giving Phillips the nickname 'Irish.' However, being that Phillips knows procedure and considers himself, and his crew, smarter than Muse and his crew, you see Phillips try to play a game with them in which, quite a few times, his ego leads to him getting assaulted, among other things. But, despite Phillips actions, Muse tries his best to keep him alive so he can get the ransom money and go home, but with Phillips complicating matters, Muse ends up damn near in a life or death situation quite a few times.PraiseAs you may note by the story summary, and intro, I liked Abdi's depiction of the character Muse, and the reason for that is that when you watch the trailer for the film, you foresee some sad depiction of Somali pirates which you think are going to be as shallow as other foreign nation villains going against an American. But, being that this is based on a true story, of which seemingly Phillips wasn't the only one kept in mind, Muse is allowed to be a human who may seem greedy, a pirate, and etc., but as you get to know him enough to understand that he sees his options as limited and he, to Phillips' face, reminds you that his country isn't America. You are reminded there is no, pull yourself up by the bootstraps or any of those things Americans, if not the western world as a whole, take for granted. For people like him, you either fight until someone dies or do as you are told. Making it so, despite Phillips technically being the victim, I found Muse to more so be the one who I felt bad for. Even without him not necessarily shedding any tears.CriticismWhen it comes to criticism, like most films based on true stories, there is an issue with time length. Part of the reason I had an issue with the time is because after a while you can assesses Muse and his friends and you can see, while desperate, they aren't really trying to do more than get their money and go. Thus bringing the amount of threat to Phillips, as well as his crew, to a nil and making it where all there are, for the most part, are bullets shot in the air. Then, to add onto that, Hanks just doesn't command your attention in the film despite being the protagonist, and makes it so you just stop caring about him and his character.Overall: TV ViewingQuite honestly, though I like Abdi's performance in the film, and hope more comes his way in terms of roles, the movie as a whole was boring. Once you realize that the pirates are amateurs, Phillips has more control over the situation than them, and then they aren't willing to fully assert themselves, the film seems like a Looney Tunes film with Hanks playing a smarter version of Elmer Fudd and everyone else being Daffy Duck. Thus making this a TV viewing type film.",7,0,0,14 January 2014
The Equalizer," A man who has retired from working for the government finds his work family threatened, as well as this young woman who he tries to give a little faith to.
","Trigger Warning(s): Depictions of torture and up close murdersIt can be argued that when it comes to Black actors who are well established, like Denzel Washington, Will Smith, Samuel L. Jackson, and Forest Whitaker, that they all have found a certain comfort zone in their acting choices. However, while on paper it may make seeing them in similar roles over and over bland, while viewing the movie you often are reminded why they are allowed this amount of comfort in the first place. For while many will compare this film to Man on Fire, which honestly it only has similarities to since it is Denzel going on a rampage to save a white girl, that is where the comparisons begin and end.Characters & StoryRobert (Denzel Washington) works at Home Depot and has found himself to be the father figure around the place. The young dudes idolize him, and want to know what he did before working there, the women find him attractive, and he treats them all with respect, a bit of charm and, whether asked or not, he will help them anyway possible. Like with Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis), he helps him go from working the floor to being Home Depot security, and then with Teri, real name Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz), he helps her believe in herself, as well as give her a second chance. Something which isn't easy to do for with Teri being young, beautiful, and worth a lot of money, her pimp Slavi (David Meunier) doesn't want to let her go. So, Robert tries to help her. Thing is, as Robert tries to help her he gets involved with the whole business which got Teri to America in the first place. Meaning he has to climb the chain in order to regain any sense of peace in his life.Leading to the main story of the film which deals with Robert taking on the Russian mafia, headed by Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Julich), a well-connected gangster, and his enforcer/ fixer Teddy (Marton Csokas). But, as well trained and talented as Robert is, he does show signs of aging. Leading you to wonder, in his quest to free one girl from human trafficking, how will he ultimately find peace? With a bullet in the head, but her free? With the snake's head cut off and him going back to being just an unknown face? Or will he find himself without peace for as he tries to climb the ladder, those he loved and wanted to protect end up falling off the roof?PraiseIn this film, Washington reminds you why his career spans over 30 years and why he is considered a legend in the film business. For while the story, as a whole, doesn't do anything drastically new or different from films with a similar premise, Washington puts his mark on it in such a way that he leaves you feeling the genre has found a new standard to live up to. For Robert is a man who you can see is conflicted about what he does, wants to create the sort of normalcy he sacrificed for most of his life, but at the same time he can't stop being the man who takes care of people when in need. Be it this kid at work who wants to be something more than he is, or this little girl who has lived a hard life but dreams that she can escape it and become better.Now, as for the action elements of the movie, truly if you are squeamish you may want to be careful with this one for this is a violent movie. For with Robert having this Sherlock Holmes, Robert Downey Jr.'s, version, of slowing down time to analyze things, and then really going all out, including using a wine opener to kill someone and us seeing the wine opener in the mouth of someone Robert just stabbed in the jaw, truly the film does get graphic.And while Washington deserves much praise, I feel you must also praise Csokas too for being a credible villain. If just because his performance, and the build of his character, is so good you honestly think when him and Washington go one on one, there is a more likely chance of them both dying than Washington being alive after their battle. Something which is hard to do since Washington is at the point in his career where it almost feels like there won't be any surprises when it comes to his character. He is either going to live until the end or somehow come up on top. However, Csokas makes you question Washington's celebrity having an effect on whether Robert will live or die.CriticismFirst and foremost, I'm rather tired of Russian villains with the names Vladimir, Dmitri, and just Russian bad guys period. It's overdone, and at this point feels kind of lazy. Though the film in itself is very basic and only elevated due to strong performances. However, if anyone else was casted as Robert or Teddy, this film would probably be a straight to VoD release. Mostly because, as lovable as Robert is, you don't get any sort of concrete details about him. You learn he worked for the government, had a wife, but pretty much that is where things end. Robert, for the most part, is as unknown to us in the end as he was in the beginning.Overall: Worth SeeingBetween Washington and Csokas, I feel future action crime thrillers need to take note. For as previously noted, this film takes all the basic elements very familiar to movie lovers and pushes the bar up. Leading to a 'Worth Seeing' label from me.",8,2,8,28 September 2014
War Dogs," When you're in your 20s and the reality of adulthood hits hard, easy money is tempting. So why not get into arms dealing with a friend?
","Trigger Warning(s): IslamophobiaCharacters Worth Noting David (Miles Teller) | Efraim (Jonah Hill) | Iz (Ana de Armas)Main Storyline22-year-old David is living with a cute girlfriend, who he recently got pregnant, is a college dropout, failed entrepreneur, and his sole steady paycheck is rubbing the bodies of older men. Men who like to tease him a little bit. As you can imagine, he is frustrated with how his life has turned out. That is, until Efraim, his friend from when he was a kid, pops up at a mutual acquaintance's funeral and they hang out. Efraim shows off this grandeur lifestyle and of course, David wants in. He has a kid on the way, wants to do right by his girlfriend Iz, and doesn't want to struggle. No, he'd rather trade in his morals in order to obtain the mighty dollar. Hell, even to benefit Iz and his child, he'd lie to her if he had to, and he does.Thing is, when you have two young men with a huge amount of ambition, willing to fib or outright lie to get ahead, it has to catch up with them eventually right?HighlightsHill has mastered crafting someone you love to hate. Efraim, no matter what aspect of his personality or business side, is someone you can't inherently stand. He is a professional con artist with a polarizing laugh which will either crack you up or annoy the hell out of you. On top of that, he is a pro at being selfish. He will adapt to the minimum required to get what he wants out of you, and then play you for a fool. Reminding you that despite some really odd and questionable films in Hill's filmography, he has been in the game for over a decade and certainly has learned a thing or two.Low PointsPerhaps the main problem of this film is that on top of the trailer giving away most of the best parts of the movie, the trailer sells you an action comedy. Making it so when Teller is left to present, mostly on his own, the film's dramatic elements, he almost seems like a liability. For with Hill, being his usual comical self, like a borderline caricature of what supposedly is a real person, it makes David's issues that Teller is trying to portray feel unwelcomed.David is trying to make money for his family and Efraim is trying to get his full hour with a prostitute. David is trying to be a good father and boyfriend, and Efraim is flipping out because someone corrects him in a meeting about IBM just being a random set of letters. I mean, the straight man and the fool works in a lot of movies, but it doesn't here. For on top of Teller trying to bring you the drama, and not doing so well at that, you are left wondering why this story, in particular, was important to tell? What makes two kids, barely old enough to drink, worth making a movie about? That question is never really answered.Going back to the topic of Teller in this film, as I wrote this review, I was questioning that with how much Hill gets to eclipse Teller in this film, could it be Teller has lost his luster? Maybe that charm and possible IT factor wasn't all him? Could it be that with his co-star in Whiplash being a supporting role challenging him or his past love interest focused complimenting his character, could that have been it? Could it be that when someone isn't cast to support or compliment his character, but rather just make their character the one remembered after the credits roll, is Teller no longer the type of lead I, admittedly, took him for?Either way, be it the movie selling one thing and you buying another, Hill and Teller's having unbalanced chemistry, or simply Teller bearing all the weight of bringing a dramatic element to this film, even if this film is 'Based on a True Story,' you never get why this one, in particular, was an important one to tell.",6,2,6,20 August 2016
It," Though marketed as a horror movie, Stephen King's IT (2017) is really a coming of age dramedy. One in which Pennywise sometimes becomes an afterthought.
","SummaryAfter the death of his little brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott), Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) remains the only one who has faith that he is just missing. He isn't dead. Something his friends try to humor but it gets difficult after a while. Especially after they all have their introductions to Pennywise (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd).With meeting IT, Bill's friends find themselves joining him in the hunt for this monster. Making a group which came together either for protection or to battle loneliness, into much more than the losers everyone thinks they are. For between facing their fears and sometimes ridding themselves of them violently, the would be losers prove they are perhaps the bravest people in Derry, Maine.HighlightsThis Adaptation Takes Advantage of Being on The Big Screen (And R) Perhaps the first thing that becomes abundantly clear is that this group of kids, they are not some PG 'Gosh Darn' saying kind of group. Between talking about having sex with each other's moms, dick sizes, and cursing galore, we are given real deal teenagers. Of which, Richie (Finn Wolfhard) and Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer) will be the main ones whose language will tickle you throughout the movie. Richie through him being a bit of a comedian (naturally), and his commentary causing constant giggles. As for Eddie, with his germophobia, among other things, he'll constantly make you roll your eyes, in a good way.With A Little More FeelingAnother thing quite notable with this adaptation is that the child actors they got, they know how to do more than crack jokes or seem like awkward teens. Each one's backstory is given some real oomph so that the source of their fears actually has weight. Take Mike (Chosen Jacobs) for example. His parents in the movie died in a fire and while, at first, them being dead leads to some real eye roll inducing teen angst, when he speaks of it with the Losers you can see the pain that caused. Especially as he expresses what sounds like guilt over it.The same can be said when it comes to Henry (Nicholas Hamilton) and Beverly (Sophia Lillis). Their issues with their dads are something which you can strangely connect with, even if you have a good relationship with your own. For Henry, as much as he abuses everyone, even cuts into Ben's (Jeremy Ray Taylor) stomach with a knife, seeing him with his dad, sniveling, kind of made you feel bad for him. Then with Beverly, wellÂ… it isn't explicitly said or shown what he may do or has done, to her, but between anger and your skin crawling, the point comes across.CriticismSometimes, Everyone Tries Too HardSome kids are better at conveying their emotions than others. Bill usually holds it down, but every now and then he gets a corny line which makes you roll your eyes. SkarsgÃ¥rd does his best to seem scary, but even for those like me who shy away from horror movies, films in the thriller genre as well, some scenes you can tell should have been scary, just don't pop. On The FencePennywiseBetween SkarsgÃ¥rd's voice damn near sounding, at times, he is auditioning to do the voice for the next live action Scooby Doo movie, to him being more creepy than scary, he just didn't really do it for me. Yet, even though his jump scares were weak, I got startled about 4 times, I will say he did make Pennywise his own. He stripped away Tim Curry's comedic take on it and tried to bring about the more sinister side. Though, unfortunately, Pennywise was also allowed to look more pathetic as well. Especially as the kids started to not become afraid of him. So while he was presented as more creepy, unfortunately, the longer you see him, the more used to his antics you get. Sort of like the kids.The Romantic SubplotThere is a love triangle in the movie between Bill, Beverly, and Ben. In it, Ben is really pulling out all the moves between his poem, being the one to awaken Beverly from whatever spell Pennywise puts her under and more. Yet, he is constantly curved. Something which is a bit heartbreaking to watch but does help setup what may happen in the sequel.But what has this topic on the fence is because it ultimately doesn't do much for the movie. It is sweet, authentic, and the setup is needed for the sequel, but ultimately everything that happens seems more for the sequel than this movie. Which sucks since the love triangle is kind of compelling to the point you do wanna see it get fully resolved.Overall: Mixed (Home Viewing)I adore what the young actors did with their characters. They vastly improved them in comparison to what was done in the mini-series and truly left a mark. The kind I expect for Lieberher, Lillis, Wolfhard, Taylor, and Grazer, will certainly lead to bigger and better things. However, SkarsgÃ¥rd, as expected, falls into the trap of most modern villains. That is, the fear you are supposed to have of him being far too forced and while he gets point for his creepiness, after a certain point, be it because we see him too much or his tricks get old fast, you build up a tolerance.Hence the Mixed label. Mainly because the young actors overshadow the star attraction despite Pennywise being the selling point. For between him overstaying his welcome, to the kids just having such rich backstories and comedic scenes, you almost forget this is a horror movie with one of the genre's iconic monsters. For you serious, at times, get the vibe this is just a drama which features the kids all dealing with their trauma in their own unique way.",7,2,4,17 September 2017
If I Stay," While the film contains most of the narrative issues the book had, some fans of the book, and those who only saw the trailer, may like the film.
","With reading the book this is based off of, as well as the book's sequel, my expectations were heightened since I knew everything that was supposed to happen. Though, as I learned from past book to movie adaptations, getting your hopes high for a movie adaptation is a foolish thing to do. For even if you like the cast, there is always the issue of what was kept, or changed, for the book's transition to the big screen. Leading to us talking about If I Stay.Characters & StoryTwo people living in different parts of the music world, one rock and one classical, one day happen come together. It begins with Adam (Jamie Blackley) hearing Mia (Chloe Moretz) play her cello, and watching her passionately go at it. From there he asks her out and their relationship begins. We watch the socially awkward Mia fall in love with this guy who is on the way to becoming a rock god, while her retired Rock & Roll parents, Kat (Mireille Enos) and Denny (Joshua Leonard), watch in delight.However, no story dealing with romance can be without conflict. Which, for If I Stay, mostly deals with the fact Mia is younger than Adam and at a different place in her music career. But that is just her issues within their relationship, seen in flashbacks. As for the real conflict which may drive them apart, it is a car accident in which Mia's family seemingly are dead, and she is wondering if, without them, should she stay?PraiseAs Moretz grows as an actress, and a bit more consistently brings depth to her roles, you can see from movie to movie that she is really honing her craft. For, as seen in Kick Ass 2 and Carrie, as much as she can play a smart mouthed young lady, she can also draw you in with her character being vulnerable, having a sense of uncertainty, and Moretz seeming just as much ready to fight and seem bad ass, as she could breakdown into tears.As for Blackley as Adam, while I admit I don't see him as a good fit for the roll, since he seems more geared to swoon the audience than be my perception of Adam, it is hard to deny Blackley and Moretz play don't well off each other. They help create the visuals for a love story in which while he helps Mia bloom, she doesn't fully lose herself and while she may fall in love, her insecurities don't just abate because of how powerful the love Adam presents is.Leaving one last thing to note: In the film there are great classical pieces used, and Adam's band is given songs to perform of which more than half were actually good.CriticismUnfortunately, between the transition from book to screen, a lot of the issues I had with the book's narrative of going back and forth on a fairly constant basis were not changed. Which sucked to me since those jumps in time make it hard to not only stay connected with the story, but also emotionally connected to the characters.Though the real problems with the film deal with changes made due to artistic license, omission, or necessity. Such as Adam's band not being called 'Shooting Star'; a lot of Adam trying to get into the ICU to see Mia being cut; the film trying to instill a bit more hope in Mia's family surviving the car crash than there is in the book, as well as more drama in Adam and Mia's relationship; and then there are general cuts you recognize had to be done. Things like us seeing how Mia and Kim became friends; seeing Kim's mom; the lead up to Mia's grandpa taking her to her Julliard audition; and a lot of the back stories including Willow's and her grandparents.All of which sort of take away the impact of dramatic moments to me. For with grandpa and Willow's roles rewritten to the point they are, their appearance feels like it means less. Like with grandpa, all the build to him taking Mia to the audition is wiped, and all that was saved is him talking about him not supporting Denny and Denny's decision to leave the band for Mia. Then, when it comes to Willow, honestly it felt like they should have wiped her character. For with her not being a force to reckon with when it comes to Adam seeing Mia, nor Teddy being at another hospital, making it where her appearance could truly be devastating, the film loses most of its drama to bad screenplay decisions.Leading back to my issue with Blackley. He, to me, doesn't look like Adam, and also has the same issue Gus, in The Fault in Our Stars, had where it seemed he was more so there to make girls squeal than woo Mia. Leaving us to talk about Moretz: in the film, I felt she over acted. For, whether I just saw Mia acting differently in the book, or her performance just not being to my taste, I felt she was a bit too over dramatic, even considering the circumstances.Overall: TV ViewingAs someone who read the book, I honestly want to say to skip this. A lot was changed, or omitted, which doesn't make this something worth seeing. However, seeing this from the point of view of someone who didn't read the book, I think there are enough laughs and cute moments throughout the film to justify seeing this. Leading to me labeling this as 'TV Viewing' since it will likely disappoint the book readers, but seems like it may be OK for those who never touched the source material.",7,0,1,6 September 2014
Gravity," A movie which relies more so on special effects than substance.
","Trigger Warning(s): Jump Scare depicting body frozen to deathI saw this film out of curiosity since it made over half a billion dollars, and since I don't think I have seen a film about someone drifting, or stuck, in space since Moon came out about 4 years ago. Then, to add onto the interest of seeing the film, Sandra Bullock is in it and Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted about it, albeit its inaccuracies, but still he said he enjoyed it overall. So with an actress who rarely fails, in modern times, and an astrophysicist I quite admire, I thought why not? Characters & StoryGravity is similar to I Am Legend, in a way, for most of the film features one sole actor, in this case actress, who we focus on. Said character is Dr. Ryan Stone (played by Sondra Bullock) who we learn very little about, besides she lost her child when she was 4 and now is working in space. Alongside her, for maybe 20 minutes to a half hour, is Matt Kowalski (played by George Clooney) who is Clooney's usual go to charming character but, again, someone we don't learn much about.As for the story, all 90 minutes of it deal with Dr. Stone trying to get home after a Russian satellite is destroyed and creates space debris which makes getting to earth nearly seem impossible. Add Matt sacrificing himself for Dr. Stone and then you have this inexperienced Dr. who you are left with, and a movie focused on us wondering if she may end up another causality or may return home?PraiseWhen it comes to praise, the almost sole thing worth praising are the visuals. One thing Dr. Tyson noted is that the film truly, visually, is stunning and can inspire someone to want to learn more about space. I'd even say that if a TV company wanted to advertise their latest 4K or 3D screen, this would be the go to movie for it.CriticismBut, to me, outside of the visuals in the film, the rest was boring. From the dialog to the characters, I just felt there was no real attempt to have the audience connect with the characters. Dr. Stone has no real personality and while we are given that one tidbit about her daughter, outside of that she has nothing to draw you to her. And in comparison to other films which rely heavily off one sole actor, like I Am Legend, even her trials and tribulations don't really get you interested in her. If anything, it just makes you want to praise the special effects members and the cinematographers, but certainly not Bullock.Overall: TV ViewingI have no regrets not seeing this in theaters. If I want to see a high definition look of space, there are museums and other places to go which specialize in this topic and can explain things to me. As for Gravity, though I'm sure I am in the minority, I think all it has is its visual appeal and everything else is lacking. Hence why I say it is for TV viewing, especially if you have one of the newer TV sets. Otherwise, I would dare even say to skip it.",6,1,3,23 December 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One is more so an exploitation of your nostalgia, and the franchise's movie re-awakening, than keeping the momentum of Episode 7 going.
","Review (with Spoilers)Noted Actor(s)Jyn (Felicity Jones) | Darth Vader (James Earl Jones)StorylineLike the majority of Star Wars films, it all begins with a child losing their parents. In this case, it is Jyn (Felicity Jones) losing her mother, and hiding as her father goes to help make what shall become the Death Star. Leading her to believe, growing up, this was her father's choice. He wanted to be part of the evil empire. However, it is revealed this isn't true. He joined them, helped them, to input a flaw. Leading to a journey to not only know the truth but spread it to the world.HighlightsJames Earl Jones Returns To Voice Darth VaderHonestly, for me anyway, the praise is in short supply but I must admit on top of it being nice to see Darth Vader in the suit again, it was especially cool that James Earl Jones returned to voice the character.CriticismForgettable and Expendable CharactersAs I'm sure many of you know, after Disney had hits with The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, and more, they released a bunch of straight to VHS releases to try to capitalize on the success of the first film. To me, Rogue One is similar to those movies. The only difference is this was given a far larger budget than past unnecessary editions so that it could have the usual special effects and decent fight scenes.But while any Star Wars picture is certainly worth noting for its special effects, at the end of the day it is the story and characters which should matter. Problem is, for this film, they don't. We are, with the exception of Vader, introduced to characters not in the original films. Making it so they all have a chance to try to make this film their own. Perhaps present this film as more than a simple cash grab using that tired Star Wars formula of the orphaned child turned hero. Yet, they don't.From our lead to the men who fight with her, it is like they utterly lack personality. I mean, this is like a generic action movie within the Star Wars universe. Not as bad as episode 1 - 3, but at least with those prequels there was some attempt at trying to give the characters admirable traits or at least plant something so that their lives mattered to you. With this film, however, it relies too heavily on the basic principle that this person is the hero so you should root for them. This person is the bad guy so you should hate them and it adds 0 complexity to it. And I know, 'What about Jyn's dad?' Well, he is barely in the movie and honestly by the time the ending is revealed, it is a relief that we shouldn't have to worry about any of these characters' story continuing.Overall: Negative (Skip It)I have never been so tempted to fall asleep during a movie and I watch movies which are purely Oscar bait. But what makes me not say this is just another 'Home Viewing' movie is because this is a blemish on the brand. This film leads you to believe Disney is trying to recoup how much they paid for this brand as quickly as possible. So even if they just make some rinky dink story, connect it to the main series at the end, and you are left with nothing to praise but the special effects, they are fine with that. After all, they aren't invested in the characters so why should you? Making it so, overall, this movie seems solely about keeping the Star Wars franchise in your thoughts and perhaps making Star Wars a perennial money maker for the house of mouse.",6,3,10,18 December 2016
World War Z," Your usual Zombie film done on a grander scale
","To be perfectly honest, the only reason I saw this film was because of Ruth Negga. But, for the rest of you, I assume Brad Pitt could be the reason for seeing this movie. Though many could be drawn by the source material or just because you got an itch to see some zombies? Either way, let's get to it!The amount of developed characters in this film are nil, but you at the very least are given a name and title to identify them by. Naturally, Brad Pitt has the lead role and he plays Gerry who seemingly is a former Special Forces soldier trying to more so protect his family than save the world. However, in order to do so, he has to aide Thierry (played by Fana Mokoena), the UN deputy secretary general, in his quest to find patient zero or a cure. Outside of those two, the only other character worth noting is Daniella Kertesz's Segen for she helps Gerry on his quest. I mean there is also Gerry's wife Karin (played by Mireille Enos) and the lovely Ruth Negga who plays a WHO (World Health Organization) Doctor, but she is not given a name.Story wise, at the end of the movie I got a sort of I Am Legend vibe from it. I don't know why though, for it resembles 28 Days Later much more. So, with that said, as you can imagine Brad plays this former soldier who is in the process of trying to live a normal, low-key life, but then something happens which forces him to show why people high up in government know who he is. In most cases the reason for the call would be a terrorist, but in this case it is a Resident Evil style outbreak which seemingly has no exact origin. So, after Brad makes sure his family is safe, he goes off to S. Korea, Israel and, ultimately, Wales to find something to save the world. All the while, he manages to get by hundreds of thousands of zombies and only ends up swallowing a little of their blood. So, basically it has the same workings of 90% of all action movies.Now, one thing I did like was the role of Segen played in this movie. The reason I point her out is because often in action movies, the women are either the hot chick the guy has to end up saving by the end, or the woman who seemingly is modeled to void any sense of femininity type of femininity as if the character can't be strong and still have feminine qualities. In this film though, I felt with Kertesz's Sergen, we were given a female character in an action movie who didn't necessarily need to be saved, doesn't play someone who is a liability, but truly plays someone who gives you the complete human experience. I say this because, unlike Brad, she doesn't come off invincible. She makes mistakes, pays for it, but still keeps fighting. For me, she was more interesting hero than Brad Pitt was throughout the movie.Which is kind of the main issue. Brad Pitt, like many other stars, doesn't have the type of acting ability where you forget it is them on screen. Add onto that, I will never understand Brad Pitt's appeal as a leading man. He acts so stiffly to me, and I find myself not being able to really get into his character at all. Yeah, we are given background, see his family and all that, but he doesn't really have the acting skills to really make you care. In comparison, Will Smith can be damn near alone a whole movie, barely talk about himself, and only have a dog for a co-star and put on a better performance.Overall: TV ViewingTo be quite honest, every single monster out there from zombies to vampires has been done to the point where seeing them in a movie sets the bar really low for none of them really try to take you to new places or liven up a monster that has been around for, perhaps, centuries. World War Z is really no different. To me, the only difference between World War Z and other films like it is that this has a bigger budget and the benefits that come from that are seen through the look of the zombies and the locals. As for the story and acting, outside of the character of Segen, no one really stands out. Everyone really feels interchangeable and even Brad. I mean, Bruce Willis could play his role and I wouldn't see a major difference. Hell, damn near anyone with a decent amount of talent, and looks, could have played Brad's role and it wouldn't make a major difference. Overall though, there is really no need to rush to see this movie. I would probably best recommend it for background noise for when you want to take a nap.",7,0,0,30 September 2013
About Time," Despite being advertised as a romantic movie, the real focus is on the relationship between brother and sister, as well as son and dad.
","For me, the main draw was seeing 'From the creator of Love Actually' on the poster, as well as seeing Bill Nighy and Rachel McAdams' name attached. Add on that this seemed like a cute sci-fi love story and I was even more entranced. However, upon seeing the film I must say I do feel a bit tricked.Cast and StoryThe film focuses on a young man named Tim (played by Domhnall Gleeson) who comes off as a sort of loser when we meet him. However, upon his father, played by Bill Nighy, revealing that the men in their family can time travel, things look like they could pick up. However, upon moving to London, things don't seem to be going well for him as he lives with his father's friend Harry (played by Tom Hollander) who is a brilliant writer but also a butt hole, and sadly his little sister Kit Kat (played by Lydia Wilson) isn't doing so well either. But, what Tim does have going for him is a job as a lawyer, but it is at a firm which doesn't respect him or partner Rory (played by Joshua McGuire), who is such a sweetheart, all that much. However, thanks to his old friend Jay (played by Will Merrick – known for generation 3 of Skins, to me anyway), he meets the love of his life: Mary (played by Rachel McAdams). Which leads to a rather sped up relationship which quickly establishes them as a couple as the movie moves on to the true focus: Tim's family; specifically Nighy as the eccentric dad, and little sis Kit Kat who is the equally eccentric daughter. For most of the movie, Mary is more so there to support Tim as he deals with the troubles of a sister who isn't really prepared for adulthood, and a father whose mortality is becoming more apparent thus leading to a movie which may not be romantic, but can be a tearjerker.PraiseWhich, to me, saved this movie. The family ties are written so well that you can forgive being duped. Kit Kat, is lovable, zany, and truly hard to not root for during her struggles. Then, with Nighy's character, he makes you think of your relationship with your own father and you almost feel like Tim, reminiscing over the good times, trying to avoid the bad, and trying to relive those moments which soon will only exist in your own memories. Also, I felt the use of Tim, and Nighy's character, use of their time travel ability was used just right. Often times it was used to fix an awkward or unsatisfying moment which was usually built into a joke. However, there were also times when the reason wasn't selfish in the sense where they are trying to make the situation perfect. Tim uses the gift to help Harry's play be perfect and Nighy's character, who is simply known as dad, uses it to make the perfect toast for his son's wedding. Then there is one time, specifically, is which there isn't a minor sacrifice, but something which would lead to major changed in Tim's life by changing the past, and I have to say I appreciated that, at least once, they really showed that this power had the ability to flip his life and they made Tim make a hard decision about using said power.CriticismWhich leads to my sole criticism, which is the romantic movie sold in the trailer is weak. For one, the romance is rushed and afterwards, it is easy not to care. For one, once he gets the information he needs to be with Mary, there is no challenge anymore. Basically, he screws up a few times to establish the relationship, and once it is done, it is done. There is no real build, trials or tribulations, or anything which makes you fall in love with them. In a way, it feels so fated that it is like they were an established couple from the beginning. But, this isn't to say they aren't cute together and that Rachel McAdams loses that sort of Meg Ryan in the 90s appeal i.e. she seems like she can be anyone's love interest and make it work. If anything, the problem is that you are forced to adapt to a story you weren't sold on watching for 2 hours.Overall: Worth SeeingThough I felt a bit like I was sold on one thing and given something else, I didn't feel jipped. For, while I didn't get a cute romantic movie featuring Rachel McAdams, I did get to see a beautifully done movie about family ties. One which truly made me cry; laugh a dozen, or so, times; and made me think that they could have easily advertised the movie for what it is and still have gotten my money. This is why I think it is worth watching. You may not get a strong romance between man and woman, but you still do see a cute and fun setup to it, and the relationship isn't bad, just not the focal point you expect it to be. However, to compensate, the film does a good job at showing the interdependency of family, from wanting to be the dad your own dad wasn't; loving a family member no matter how odd, or off, they are; and being there for someone when they are drowning and are seemingly at the point where perhaps fighting for air doesn't seem worth the effort anymore. This film gives you a true look at the importance of family and how that importance, and love, extends to extended family.",8,4,8,3 November 2013
Don Jon," Though marketed as a comedy, it does better when it puts the comedy aside and tries to really analyze things.
","If you are one of the few who haven't been force fed a Don Jon commercial, advertisement or trailer in recent months, I'm pretty sure the NSA probably doesn't know where you are. With that said though, it is hard to not be interested with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson and even Tony Danza, who hasn't really been in much as of late, in the movie. Also, considering this is Gordon-Levitt's first go at writing and directing a feature film, there is also that added bit of intrigue.Now, something you'll notice about Don Jon is that most characters feel like a slight stereotype, especially those in Jon's family. Jon (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has the makings of a stereotypical Jersey Italian who easily could have been part of the Jersey Shore show. He is aggressive, likes keeping things prim and proper, sees himself as a ladies man, and yet seems like the life he lives isn't the most satisfying. I mean, perhaps it is his porn addiction doing him in or maybe the fact he hasn't found the right one, supposedly? So, enter Barbara (played by Scarlett Johansson), who unfortunately is sporting a ridiculous Italian-like accent as Gordon-Levitt. With her, we begin to really see past what the trailer has us focus on in terms of Jon being into his pad, his body, his ride, his church, his family, his girls, and his porn. With her entering in the film, we begin to realize that the porn probably is the most important thing to him to the point where it has basically shaped his view of women. He isn't alone though, Barbara also has an issue, but rather than it be porn, it is with romance movies. So, while Jon has a unrealistic, and as Esther (played by Julianne Moore) says, a one sided view of sex and relationships, Barbara has the same issue. But, what got her is the way romance films, and probably Disney films when she was a kid, have affected how she views sex and relationships. The film as a whole though doesn't really try to analyze male culture in terms of how pornography has a psychological affect on men's mind, nor how romance movies create an unrealistic expectation of women's minds, if anything it is just a comedy which sort of evolves. The beginning of the movie is very comical, though not in a way where the jokes are setup to hit you hard like The Heat or This Is The End. The film instead has the type of comedy which won't get the whole theater roaring with laughter, but will make a handful laugh. Which isn't a big problem for the story stays pretty consistent, in terms of entertaining you and though Gordon-Levitt hasn't always had the best track record when playing a lead character, you can see he is really starting to gain a confidence and charm which could easily put him in the position of being a go-to for film directors.I have to say though, the transition in this film from it being a light comedy to it beginning to analyze Jon as a character was a little rough at first, if just because Esther was the catalyst for this and she didn't smoothly come in, but sort of barged her way in. Once you get used to her though, she is alright, even though she had something really dramatic happen to her which doesn't necessarily make you feel sorry for her, but some sort of awkward. Also, I wasn't fond of how many times the movie decided to do these flashing scenes, not of bodies, where it would literally blind you for a good few seconds and I'm sure staring at the screen could give some people a seizure. And lastly, I must note, I am not sure why they gave Brie Larson such a small and strange role in this film. She for nearly the entire film is on her phone, delivers one line which presents the whole idea that Barbara has the whole princess in a fairy tale issue, and that is it. I mean, perhaps her being on the phone all the time was supposed to be a running gag, but it wasn't that funny.Overall: Worth SeeingI would not say to run out and see the film immediately. Truth be told, I only counted about 13 laughs through the movie, and none of them were the type I couldn't hold back. They were just little chuckles. But, set aside the expectation for a comedy and you really have an interesting film. Though it presents itself like every other romantic comedy in terms of the guy meeting the girl, falling in love, breakup at climax and reconciliation, it diverts from this and even pokes fun at it a bit. And what I like the most is it approaches the idea of trying to understand how and why a person goes monogamous, without looking at it from the 'It is time for me to settle down' route. Instead, it focuses on how porn and romance movies shape our expectations and how those expectations have influence on what we seek out. Jon is looking for a girl who wants to have sex like a porn star and Barbara is looking for the guy marketed to girls in romance movies. Both are sort of in lala land and Esther helps save Jon from keeping up his routine by helping him understand the difference from the difference between how they have sex in porn to what it is to make love to a woman. It all is fascinating stuff and that is why I think the film is worth seeing.",7,5,8,7 October 2013
Moana," With the return of John Musker and Ron Clements, who made some Disney's classics, we are reminded why the House of Mouse has long been the pinnacle of animated storytelling.
","Generally, I shy away from musicals for only a handful of songs I like and the rest I suffer through. However, there is always an exception made for Disney. For even though the magic and replay value of their 90s songs has long been gone (I still do not understand the love for 'Let It Go'), they still can pull tears out of your ducts and remind you why, even if you are way past their targeted market, the reason you fell in love with the company as a kid.Noted Actor(s)Moana (Auli'I Cravalho) | Maui (Dwayne Johnson) | Gramma Tala (Rachel House) | Chief Tui (Temuera Morrison) | Hei Hei (Alan Tudyk)StorylineFor a generation, Chief Tui has forbidden his people to explore the world beyond their island's reef. Something his mother Tala understands the reason for but doesn't agree with at all. Especially as the island begins to no longer be the resource-rich home it once was. Enter Moana. She, like her father when he was young, has a sense of adventure in her, something no matter how many times she is warned, her dad can't force out of her. So, as she sees her home dying, and her dad preps her to become the chief, she takes her people's fate beyond the reef and seeks out Maui. A demigod who, according to legend, thanks to him taking the heart of Tahiti, released a darkness onto the world which is why Moana's people are facing the peril they are.HighlightsIt Will Make You CryDeath and rejection are a huge part in modern animated stories, and not just within anime. Disney, as long as I can remember, would always have a dead parent or a misfit somewhere in its movie. This one is no different but, arguably, it isn't like before. Just take Maui for example. His backstory of how he became a demi-god is heartbreaking in a way. That on top of the reason why Tui doesn't want his people venturing past the reef, and what Cravalho through her voice, and the various animators and writers, bring to Moana's story. For while there is this little small part of me which wishes to compare this to Musker and Clements past work, which in some ways they nod to, this film reminds me of something. It reminds me of why people like Floyd Norman love working at Disney and why we, from pampers through our adult years, laugh, cry, and create more and more fond memories of their products.It Will Make You Laugh*Okay, if you are a kid, or can appreciate humor made for children, between Maui and Hei Hei you'll find quite a few chuckles here and there. The ocean also plays a role in the laughter as we see it interact with Maui, Hei Hei, and especially its interactions with Moana.On The FenceIt's FormulaicIn fact, Maui even jokes about it. A young princess, though technically chief's daughter, with her animal, Hei Hei, going on an adventure. But while the story seems familiar, and at times may remind you of The Little Mermaid in terms of Moana's relationship with her dad, Maui's tattoo companion reminding you of some of the animation in Hercules, Moana kind of looking like a slightly older Lilo, and I could go on, the familiarity ultimately helps you connect with the film. For as you pick up on what perhaps is Clements and Musker tipping their hat to their past work, it reminds you of what those movies made you feel and it makes you connection to this new movie of theirs even stronger. Sort of like how, for some, the new J.K. Rowling movie I'm sure brings up old emotions from reading, or watching Harry Potter.Overall: Positive (Worth Seeing)While it is formulaic, and also the songs may not be instant classics, it is funny, it has depth, it has a sense of culture, and honestly as Disney tries to diversify and stray away from its classic princesses, it continues to be a step forward. Reminding you the house of mouse need not depend on Pixar for it remains the juggernaut of the industry it damn near built. A title, and role, even with the occasional hiccup, it seems it may never lose even with its founder long passed.",8,5,25,22 November 2016
The Book Thief," With a holocaust backdrop, The Book Thief explores a young girl's world filled with tragedy, but with people who inspire both love, hope and perseverance.
","After seeing three films featuring the horrors of slavery, it is only right to throw a holocaust film in there. However, it should be noted that The Book Thief isn't a rated R picture, so it may give you an idea of what is going on, but never gets so gritty you feel that a young person couldn't go see for it would leave them with nightmares. With that said though, don't think this film doesn't have the potential to bring tears to your eyes.Characters & StoryThe lead of this film is a young girl named Liesel (played by Sophie Nelisse) who, seemingly, was abandoned by her mother and now is under the care of an old couple. Said couple, Hans (played by Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (played by Emily Watson) are complete opposites. Hans is the usual silly dad you would find in a sitcom, though not on the level of Phil on Modern Family, and Rosa is the more serious of the two. Maybe even so serious she could fit a possible stereotype of eastern European people. Outside of Liesel's new family is the boy who has a crush on her Rudy (played by Nico Liersch), and he seemingly has the type of love for her which could be a movie on its own, maybe a 1940s German version of Bridge to Terabithia. Then there is Max (played by Ben Schentzer) who is a Jew Liesel bonds with as he hides in their home, and lastly there is death (voiced by Roger Allam) who is, naturally, an ominous figure.Together, they make a film in which we watch Liesel become familiar with a street where all these characters meet, and the street is named Heaven, or Heavenly. Liesel starts off aloof, but Rudy breaks down those walls, and Hans is the first one to help her truly blossom. Then comes Max who inspires Liesel to write, and amongst this all is a woman named Ilsa Hermann (played by Barbara Auer) who provides the resources for Liesel's vocabulary to grow. But, as Liesel's mind advances, so does Germany's war and with Death being a character in the movie, you are always on pins and needles.PraiseFirst and foremost, perhaps there hasn't been as interesting of a young female lead in a movie since Ivana Baquero in Pan's Labyrinth or Lina Leandersson in the original Let The Right One In. But, considering Nelisse speaks English, likely she maybe able to follow after Saoirse Ronan, Jennifer Lawrence or even Chloe Moretz and find herself a nice career. It must be noted though, part of the beauty of her performance comes from playing off her wonderful supporting cast. Rush's character, and Watson's too to a point, make wonderful parents who present both the fun loving side of humanity, and the side of humanity which worries about everything and because of that, they become critical of those who find freedom in just living.Also, a part of me liked how, despite the holocaust background, the focus wasn't strongly on Max. If anything, him coming in and the beginning of the holocaust showed that, even as allegiances had to be made, not everyone was in support of the regime, at least in private. Perhaps though, most of all, it was just nice to watch Nelisse get comfortable in the role. She started off aloof, as said, and awkward to the point where you want to question her talent, but as he character becomes familiar with her surroundings, we see her abilities shine and that is why I think she could have a great career with this being her western world launch pad.CriticismOf course though, as with any movie, there are issues. For one, though I love Rudy's character, sometimes Liersch had that same awkwardness Nelisse had, but for him it never ended. Even in the middle, to end, of the movie, he still seemed like he wasn't comfortable yet and while it didn't badly hamper things, he did stick out. Other than that, the only other issue was the ending. The ending leaves you with some unanswered questions and a lack of clarity. Not in such a major way where it ruins the movie, but it will likely lead to you asking someone, like I will on IMDb, what their take was.Overall: Worth SeeingI'll admit, I didn't get as emotional as I thought I would/ should during many scenes, but after Scandal, Monogatari and The Best Man Holiday, maybe I'm just all cried out this weekend. Still, the performances are largely brilliant, the story is compelling and there are moments which bring tears and laughter. Not to forget, this could possibly be the movie which may lead to Ms. Nelisse's career taking off, and who doesn't want to say they remember seeing a quality actress when they first started (she has other work, but this seems to be her first western-world role).",8,3,8,17 November 2013
Suicide Squad," In an effort to create a viable DC franchise, Warner Brothers rushes what could of been an awesome movie.
","Trigger Warning(s): Violence Against Women (Without Discretion)Main StorylineThe story begins with a very good question: What would the world, though as always specifically America, do if a being like Superman came down and didn't side with man, but decided instead to annihilate it? Well, this is what Amanda Waller asks. This is the reason why she believes she should be allowed to use a host of different villains, all of which primarily have no real powers so they remain semi-useless, but they are bad guys. If they die, it's a win. If they live and somehow handle the task given, it's a win. All you gotta do is implant a bomb in them and send them off. After all, as much as they all are villains, seemingly fearless, everyone has a weakness and for them, it is one of the few loved ones they have which, despite knowing how cruel and evil they can be, love them despite of.HighlightsThere are really only three characters worth noting, in a positive manner. The first being Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. I highlight her performance because it is rare for a Black woman to be in a role like this. On top of her being the boss, she is a bad ass, a hard ass, and doesn't at all try to be likable. Her main objective is to be good, no, excel at her job by any means necessary. All of which Davis plays in such a good way. Granted, there isn't a movie or show in which she doesn't seem drained from dealing with people's BS and likely wanting to shoot people as Waller does, but getting to see her actually do it was something.Next up is Jared Leto's Joker. Now, unfortunately, we don't get Joker in full effect. He isn't the primary villain of the film so outside of his romance with Harley, if you want to call it that, he comes and goes rather frequently. With that said, in an ideal world, before this movie we might have seen him go against Ben Affleck's Batman. For while he does seem like a hipster Joker, and surely isn't as comical or interesting as Heath Ledger's take, he isn't as bad as many thought he would be.Leaving everyone's favorite: Harley Quinn. This character has deserved to be in a live action production for years. After all, when you think of female villains, in the DC or even Marvel universe, there aren't a whole lot with the profile Harley has. So with the way Robbie plays her, again you get a similar vibe like you get with Leto. You honestly wonder why this character wasn't allowed to be properly introduced? Why is she starting in a group movie where, yeah, director/ writer David Ayer knew to feature her, but couldn't just have her dominate, as perhaps she should have. I mean, I won't pretend that her one liners and being the group weirdo didn't get old, but with the flashbacks dealing with how she fell in love with Joker, alongside some of the scenes she had with the squad, it is hard to argue that Robbie may be one of the few who may full on benefit from this movie.Low PointsStorywise, and when it comes to The Enchantress, that is the downfall of the film. The story tries to give you just enough to know who every villain is, but it really isn't enough. For the actors who have charisma, or know how to play their characters, like Smith and Robbie, you are left wanting more. As for everyone else, you are left wondering: 1. Who are they, 2. Who is the hero to their villain, and 3. Can't they die to give Deadshot and Harley more screen time?To dive a bit deeper, Deadshot and Harley are given backstories. We are told how they fought and lost against the Batman, we get to learn why they are cool, and we are given enough to the point you honestly feel that you are watching snippets of a movie Warner Brothers didn't fully finance. With that though comes those two trying to keep you engaged while The Enchantress, played by Cara Delevingne, is supposed to be your villain.Now, I have nothing against Delevingne, but the model turned actress reminds me a lot of Jessica Alba. Yes, she is pretty and likely fun to work with, probably knows all her lines when someone yells 'Action!' but she is kind of dead on the screen. Granted, she is playing against Will Smith and Margot Robbie, but come on! The one thing DC has over Marvel is at least their villains, well the Batman ones anyway, are formidable, interesting, and well known. Why use this one? Much less, why have Delevingne play her?Though perhaps the real issue is that the whole argument for the Suicide Squad is that one day there might be a being, like The Enchantress, who decides to not side with man like Superman did but try to destroy the world. That is what the Enchantress tries to do and who do they send? People who know how to use weapons, with Deadshot having deadly accuracy, and one guy, Diablo, who is actually a meta-human and can do something. Everyone else is pretty much impractical in situations like this. Making it so when The Enchantress is defeated by them, especially considering how she is defeated, you begin to realize why so many critics, so fiercely, trashed this movie.",7,1,4,6 August 2016
American Hustle," A con is played featuring politicians, mobsters, the FBI and two people with a complicated relationship.
","After Silver Linings Playbook, it is hard to not be curious about David O. Russell's new production featuring the stars of his last movie. Mind you, Jennifer Lawrence is in a smaller role, and Robert De Niro has been reduced to being in one sole scene, but with Christian Bale picking up the slack and Amy Adams replacing Lawrence as female lead, you are given quite the combination which may not be as comical or crazy as fellow con-man focused movie The Wolf of Wall Street, but while Wolf relied on debauchery, style, and outright sensationalism, Hustle has sustenance and takes it times, scatters jokes throughout and is more about the story than having you watch one crazy thing happen after the next.Characters & StoryThe main character of the film is Irving (played by Christian Bale), this creepy looking con man, who mostly specializes in fraudulent loans and art. Alongside side him is business partner/ mistress, Sydney (played by Amy Adams) who seemingly is all he ever needed in a wife. She is smart, cunning, and flexible; but unfortunately for Irving his wife is Rosalyn (played by Jennifer Lawrence) a woman who seemingly has arrested development. But, though Irving would love to divorce her, between her threatening to take away her son, which he adopted, and dangling threats of snitching, he is trapped.Leading to the main focus of the story which is when FBI agent Richard, though commonly called Richie (played by Bradley Cooper), catches Sydney and Irving trying to con him. Leading to a series of cons which get more and more complex to the point that you aren't sure who is on whose side. You see, Sydney pretend to be this English woman named Edith in order to con just about everyone but Irving who helped craft the character, and then with Richie using them both so that he can make a name for himself, this leads these three to going from something small like taking down Camden mayor Carmine Polito (played by Jeremy Renner), to Richie trying to take down the mob leader Victor Tellegio (played by Robert De Niro). This is despite his boss Stoddard (played by Louis C.K.) trying to reign him in whenever possible, but with Richie having a very similar mentality to Rosalyn and trying to make a name for himself, he ends up digging his grave more and more to the point where between Richie's ambitions and Rosalyn's big mouth, everything seemingly falls apart.PraiseWhat sets American Hustle apart from its closest competitor is that all the weight of the movie doesn't rest on one or two people's shoulders. Also, as noted in the beginning, there isn't a reliance on sex, drugs and excess in order to fuel your interest. Hustle focuses on, albeit through caricatures, telling a true story, with some embellishments and serving it up nicely. Perhaps though what really deserves praise are the portrayals, for though they aren't award worthy, they can still be considered competition.The reason I say this is because, the cast embodies these characters to a point where, despite being caricatures, you can actually see them as real people. Take Amy Adams' Sydney. Perhaps in the film's best performance, you get a sense of empathy for this character to the point as the film goes on, you begin to believe that perhaps, as much as the men in the film are, maybe you are being conned too? But, don't take Sydney to just be some floozy, for though both Irving and Richie are cheating on a significant other with Sydney, even outside the relationship drama you are given quite a bit. We are provided with enough details that, especially with Sydney, you can almost create a character analysis in your head and really understand them to the point of even guessing their character's story trajectory and understanding why they did what they did in the movie.Leading to the last thing worth noting: the comedic moments. To me, all the leads are guaranteed to make you laugh due to their character's personality. Lawrence as Rosalyn, for example, seems like she is just the most annoying bits of Lawrence's public persona amped up and then made funny. Then you have the interaction and lives between Irving and Richie of which the majority of the laughs are given either due to Bale's ridiculous toupee; Richie's ego, especially when you combine Stoddard; and other memorable scenes, which keep you engaged.CriticismReally, when it comes to critique, perhaps my main issue is that the con as a whole does feel dragged out as the movie goes on to the point where when it gets more complex, it seems like the writers were trying to reinvigorate the movie. But, again, considering this is a true story, perhaps it is unfair to fault the writers with a con which, in itself, was a bubble waiting to burst. Outside of that, one issue I had is with Robert De Niro's character. In the film he plays this menacing mobster and due to the complexity of the con, I must admit I was left unsure if he was part of it, or if he was a real mobster who almost got screwed over, but didn't, and decided to just stay out of the FBI's way.Overall: See in TheatersThough I like American Hustle, it doesn't compare to Silver Linings Playbook nor is as entertaining as Wolf of Wall Street. However, I do feel the method of presenting a story featuring caricatures of the actual people the story is based on, rather than try to present something true to life worked well, but while the story is good, the overall movie doesn't feel like something you should rush to see and I'm sort of on the edge of saying to wait for the DVD release.",8,2,8,31 December 2013
Divergent," And so rises a new trilogy, but with this one we get a more fleshed out hero to root on.
","Trigger Warning(s): Violence against women & short scene showing attempted rapeLet me first state I did not read the books and what first drew me to this film was Zoe Kravitz being in it, but after seeing The Spectacular Now, having the reunited Shailene Woodley and Miles Teller in the film was quite the bonus. Add on Maggie Q, Mekhi Phifer, and Kate Winslet, you pretty much have one of the best casted YA book adaptations, which follow the a female lead.Characters & StoryIn an Oligarchy system, featuring limited social mobility, people are split between five factions, at least in the hub of Chicago. You are either a Erudite, the highly intelligent; Amity, the farmers; the Canter, the white collar justice system; the Dauntless, the soldiers and police; the Abnegation, the social workers and government; or you are the faction less. In their world there is no in-between. Faction over blood, so if you decide to change factions from your family, there is a likely chance you may never see them again, and with the system as it is, leaving your family is almost portrayed as dishonor and disloyalty. However, there are those who want to break this system.Enter Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) who is our heroine. She is what is known as a Divergent, someone capable of fluidity between the characteristics of all the major factions, which is a problem for Ms. Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet). You see, Ms. Matthews, being the head of the Erudite clan, seemingly wants to seize power for just being part of the technological movement isn't enough. She believes the Erudite should run the government, so she decides to do two things: 1. Discredit the Abnegation faction by going after their leader and mounting support, and 2. Using the Dauntless, with their leader Max's (Mekhi Phifer) help, to commit genocide.All this leads Tris, Beatrice's new name after joining the Dauntless, on a journey which has her be tested in physical confrontation, mental abilities, and being left with very few things to fight for, but for what is left she seems willing to give her life for.PraiseNow, I don't mean to put down other YA adaption headed by women, but to me Tris was the first one which seemed human and real. Catniss seems so devoid and drained of emotion that it is like she is a robot whose AI hasn't been updated to emulate human emotions; and though I loved Beautiful Creatures, the heroine for that film seemed more so like she was made to fit some type of standard for the respectable woman. With Divergent though, Tris to me was a human character. She was written with flaws, fears, strengths and just enough of an awkwardness so that she doesn't become something worth rolling your eyes at. And I think the credit must go to Woodley. Though The Secret Life of the American Teenager made me write off any talent she could have had, her film choices have really allowed her to blossom. She has the capability of playing someone who is vulnerable, and seemingly meek on the outside, yet can have this fierce passion which even if she gets her ass whooped, there is still a fire which makes you want to root for her. Also, I must note that for a movie a little over two hours, I never felt like I was bored. Woodley's co-stars, and the Divergent universe is so interesting to the point the missing details bother you enough to want to pick up the book. And perhaps that is the biggest praise you can ever give in this day and age.CriticismHowever, and mind you some of this criticism is due to not reading the book, I do wonder why despite all the technological advances, even with the apocalypse, there are no telephones? I ask this because each faction is somewhat secluded, and I could not understand how these people cut themselves off from their families? I mean, young adult rebellion from what you grew up in makes sense, but to seemingly do it forever? I don't get it.But, perhaps my biggest issue is that it Divergent follows a lot of the usual standards for Young Adult adaptation to screen. And I won't spoil too much of it, but as you watch nothing really does feel like you can't guess the next move. I mean, as Tris goes through her trials you do wonder where her journey could go, but after a certain point you can see things are set in stone. However, perhaps my biggest issue is the fact they pair Tris with a love interest, and though said love interest doesn't have someone to compete with, at the same time I would love for a movie like this with a Hayao Miyazaki type way of showing friendship between the sexes, instead of always having it go toward a relationship being endgame.Overall: Worth SeeingTo me, this is better than The Hunger Games and so much easier to get into. Woodley seems very in her element, and between the action, the friendships, and the threat of domination, it is very satisfying. And though I doubt I will read the books, I will likely spoil everything for myself by checking the Wikipedia entry. So, with that said, go see it!",8,7,31,21 March 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Though AIDS for most is a death sentence, it also can be that jolt which changes people's lives.
","Trigger Warning(s): Vocal BigotryI've been meaning to see this film for a few weeks and the first time I tried to it was sold out. Something that hasn't happened to me in years. So of course that heightened my interest, as well as the Oscar buzz for both Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. So after purchasing a ticket online, which is always a smarter decision, I finally got to see this.Characters & StoryThe focus of the film is on an electrician/ bull-rider named Ron Woodroof. When we first meet him, he is the embodiment of your stereotypical redneck. He is sexist, racist, homophobic as hell, and then he finds out he got AIDS. Now, mind you, when Woodroof gets AIDS it is the 1980s so the disease is assumed to be solely something homosexual and drug addicts get, and while Woodroof may like coke he almost beats the crap out of anyone who dares hints he is gay. But, once he reveals his diagnosis to a friend, that is all they see him as, and with his health failing and him in denial of the disease, he finds himself in a position where either he can live to the 30 days Dr. Sevard (played by Denis O'Hare) prescribed, or fight.Thus leading to what the majority of the movie is about. Woodroof's fight to live begins with him doing research while we, as an audience, slowly see how the health care industry, if not many of the world, decided to handle those with AIDS. Whether it be showing them as guinea pigs for the pharmaceutical industry, with FDA approval; or as social pariahs, especially those of the gay community, that is the world Woodroof finds himself in, with disdain for being associated with what the movie makes out to be an almost sole gay issue, outside of one sole woman.Well, perhaps really two. Now, though Dr. Eve Saks (played by Jennifer Garner) maybe one of Woodroof's love interests, and the one who helps him with AIDS and through other issues, truly the woman who deserves the most credit for helping Woodroof evolve as a person is Rayon (played by Jared Leto). Rayon is a trans-gendered, pre-op, woman who helps Woodroof go from this bigoted man into one who seemingly does have a heart. The two form a bond in which while Woodroof travels the world in order to find drugs which deal with the symptoms of AIDS, as part of him running the Dallas Buyers Club, Rayon handles the fort and is almost the Virginia to Woodroof Bill Masters (from Masters of Sex).PraiseOne thing I love about this movie, amongst the other movies out recently featuring some butt hole as the lead, is Woodroof actually evolves in the movie, rather than pretty much stays the same person throughout. Also, like most movies, there is a good bit of comedy to get you through the movie, but perhaps what really needs to be praised is Jared Leto as Rayon. Many times in movies, a supporting actor being good can be considered when they outdo those who are considered the lead. However, Leto instead plays the part of supporting actor in such a way where while he may not outdo McConaughey, he almost seems like the crutch, or walker, which keeps the film moving and I think without Rayon this film wouldn't be half as good as it is.As for McConaughey, unlike his likely competitors for various awards, what you must note is that Woodroof is the sole one which has heart. For though he is a bit of a bastard, with him actually evolving past that there is the slight desire to move past the person who we were introduced to. Also, the way McConaughey, and Leto as well, physically seem to falter due to their characters having AIDS seems more than simply makeup and them being skinny, but something which can actually, perhaps, make you forget that the real people who this is based on are dead.CriticismWhen it comes to issues though, I really couldn't find many for while I wasn't fond of the hate speech, most of those who participated got proper comeuppance. Also, I found it weird how only Woodroof and one woman were the sole, seemingly, heterosexuals with AIDS. Outside of that though, nothing really pops into my head. Though, after reading a bit about the film, I must admit it would have been interesting to see Woodroof's daughter in the film.Overall: Worth SeeingTo me, many of the bigger release which are getting Oscar buzz have a bit too much focus in trying to be funny than telling a story, and while Dallas Buyers Club surely has its moments in which the actors are trying to make you laugh, it feels like they are truly trying to use someone's real life story to do more than entertain you for 2 hours. Hence why I say this is worth seeing for, amongst the tales of con men and others, this to me stands out based off the films I've seen this season.",8,3,5,1 January 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," With beautiful special effects, and a good enough story to spend a little more than 2 hours with, while it may lack emotional punch, it is undeniably entertaining.
","My love for the X-Men was not born due to the comics, or even the cartoons, it was the video games. So, off the bat, let me say while I may know characters faces, and a bit about their background, largely I am quite oblivious to the various universes and stories. So walking in I didn't know much besides fairly recent news stories dealing with Rogue's part being cut, to Kitty seemingly being the one who was supposed to go to the past. Outside of that though, I was a clean slate. Making the movie quite the experience, even if sometimes confusing and surely with details lacking.Characters & StorySometime in the future, the sentinels have almost completed a genocide of not only living mutants, but those who would be the mothers/ fathers, or even grandparents of them. Not only that, mutant allies are killed. But, there remains hope. Said hope is entrusted in Logan/ Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who, through Kitty Pride (Ellen Page), is sent 50 years back in time to try to make the reconciliation of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy/ Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender/ Ian McKellen) happen far before both are senior citizens.Along this journey though, there is a need to address Mystique's (Jennifer Lawrence) position in all that happens, as she seems integral in either the destruction, or salvation, of mutant kind. All because of her interactions with one man: Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). The precursor to William Stryker (Josh Helman), who may not hate mutants, but surely is aware that with their rise comes mankind becoming obsolete, or downsized in the grand scheme of things. So, live or die, that is Mystque's decision, and with Logan having a limited time to change the past, catching and changing the mind of a highly illusive woman, with Xavier's help of course, is quite the task.PraiseWith this being a Marvel movie, especially X-Men, the biggest bit of praise first has to go to the special effects team. Between the fights against the sentinels, the transformations of Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and Mystque, as well as watching all mutants involved exhibiting their powers to varying degrees, it left me in awe enough to forget to take down notes at times. Also, as most Marvel movies have, there is a good use of humor, though it unfortunately isn't seen throughout but only in certain sections. Quicksilver (Evan Peters), for example, probably left the biggest impression on me because his interactions with Logan, Magneto and Xavier were hilarious, and definitely a highlight of the film. Peters way of delivering lines almost seemed Deadpool like.But, if you were to focus just on the story, and set aside the special effects and jokes, I'm slightly sad to say that the veterans do a far better job at bringing some sense of emotion to the story than the newcomers. Naturally, the genuine friendship between Sir Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart makes the Magneto/ Professor X saga more than some re-imagined Malcolm X vs. Martin Luther King Jr. Their complicated history is masterfully crafted by McKellan and Stewart to the point they eclipse the other actors for their performances have various degrees of emotion, while everyone else seemingly only exhibit fear or self- loathing.CriticismAnd with that said, being someone who increasingly has watched Marvel films, I have to say I found it odd that the film with the largest amount of misfits, and those that have suffered, didn't lead to stronger performances. Which isn't to say they weren't good, though more so adequate, but perhaps with McKellen and Stewart there, using their veteran experience on how you could get a point, or feeling, across without overdoing it, in comparison it just makes the other actors look just good enough. Take for example the two major relationships in the movie: Young Xavier and Magneto, and Young Xavier and Mystique. Considering all that happens in the past is what is supposed to build toward the future, be it lost chemistry, or perhaps too many special effects to take into consideration, I found it hard to get lost in characters interacting and sensing a serious connection between them. Making it where the film leaped from past to present, it was like dealing with a bright enough light bulb to one which was luminous.Which to me was weird since in First Class there was good chemistry. But in this film there lacks consistency. Like a flickering light bulb you know you just put in, you know what should happen, and that it worked in the past, but don't understand why things aren't working now. And while I must note time constraints make it so long heart to hearts aren't possible in the film, I do feel like this was perhaps one of the few Marvel films, for me, which probably focused more the action and effects than it did characters and the story.Overall: Worth SeeingThough I must admit I felt a bit disappointed that the movie lacked a sense of heart, the drama of impending doom, watching Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart interact, as well as seeing all my favorite mutants, push this toward being a 'Worth Seeing.'. For really, what comic book movie is really trying to aim for Oscar nominations? They are purely aimed at entertaining and keeping the franchise's name out there. And while I feel this film may not inspire someone to develop further knowledge of the X-Men universe to spoil the sequel, it is certainly good enough to keep you loyal.",8,24,36,24 May 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," What surely maybe this decade's 'The Notebook.'
","I read The Fault in Our Stars years ago without any idea of it becoming as big as it would. It was simply a recommended book on Amazon and I needed something to read to keep myself from going insane due to school work. So I read chapter after chapter, finding myself so in love, and envious, of the relationship Augustus and Hazel had; hoping despite all odds there would be a happy ending amongst the infinities.Characters & StorySomewhere in the world there was a girl named Hazel (Shailene Woodley) who spent her time reading a book, people watching, and drowning her days in television. Then her world is shaken by this pest named Augustus (Ansel Elgort). Like her cancer he came uninvited and infected her being, finding his way in first through her eyes and mind before eventually working himself into her heart. She tries to reject his pursuit, knowing that ultimately things wouldn't end well, but after the denial that someone could find her beautiful, the short term anger which came from thinking he smokes cigarettes, came the bargaining. She would let herself be happy, and let him try his best to do so.This lasts for quite some time and then depression kicks in. For as happy as they are, it doesn't take away from the fact both are cancer stricken. But there is an acceptance that they both will eventually die, but with a finite amount of time to do an infinite amount of things, why waste any moment thinking about that which is out of their control when the opportunity of love has entered their lives? Something once thought of to maybe not be an option.PraiseOne of the most difficult things when it comes to book adaptations is getting the characters right. Woodley as Hazel I admit didn't seem to fit at first, but with me seeing more and more of Woodley's work since The Secret life of the American Teenager, it is easy to see why she is quickly becoming the go to girl for films like these. As I said in Divergent, the abilities of Woodley to portray a simple character and make her into something with a heartbeat is astounding. For while arguably none of her characters seem that complex on paper, or when introduced, she pushes past that and helps us see the hope and genuine desire in each character to live a fulfilling life, making her casting as Hazel impeccable. Woodley is able to express Hazel's downtrodden nature without the shedding of tears and as jaded as Hazel is, you can see her vulnerable to the idea of being happy when Gus enters her life, and the hope he brings you can see it in every hug, kiss, and tear being like a shot of happiness she thought no make a wish foundation could ever fulfill.And thankfully, while like any adaptation some things are cut or reduced, the story keeps the big moments when it comes to Gus' and Hazel's relationship which will surely put a smile on your face. For while they are a bit overly cutesy, it does remind you of the time when the concept of love wasn't tainted by past relationships or heartbreak, and it seemed like all there could be is possibilities.CriticismHowever, as I watched the film I must say that sharing the experience in a room filled with squealing young ladies really does ruin the experience. Though I could also say that it might have to do with the casting as Elgort as well. As with any film adaptation, there is the issue of what you envisioned characters to be versus what you will get with the film. And, for me, Elgort as Gus was much more arrogant and douche-like than I pictured Gus. Also, he does not have the same ability Woodley has to take a character and bring them to life. Arguably, I felt he was more so trying to charm the girls in the audience than Hazel in an effort to make himself, Elgort that is, into a heartthrob.Which isn't to say as you got used to Elgort you can't be seduced by his charm, but I still had such a difficult time seeing this young man as Gus. Which leads to perhaps the biggest issue, which maybe because of me not agreeing with the casting of Elgort, and that is that despite how sad certain moments in the movie are, I didn't find myself crying surprisingly. I got teary eyed when Woodley did her thing, but for everyone else it just was this weird recognition that, yes, I am witnessing a sad moment, but the majority of the actors never fully got me to that place where I couldn't hold back my emotions. Overall: Worth SeeingWhile I have small qualms over things like casting which surely kept me from fully being immersed, though knowing what was to happen surely didn't help, this isn't to say this isn't a good movie. To me, The Fault in Our Stars has all the makings of a genuine classic for this decade, and perhaps generation. You have your usual male lead willing to do and say anything to make his love interest smile, and said love interest is a witty, smart, and sweet young woman who needs to hear, feel, and experience all the guy has to offer. Making for a film which inspires you, could make you a bit envious, and furthers your thoughts on the ideal life partner and relationship. For while Hazel and Gus' time is finite, seeing all they are willing to do for each other in these finite moments, it can potentially leave you speechless and balling in tears.",8,0,6,5 June 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A story, within a story, within a story, of a young man's eccentric father figure who taught him everything he knows.
","Let it be noted I have only seen Darjeeling Limited and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou when it comes to Wes Anderson's movies and each one contains this weird sort of oddness which you so badly want to associate with someone, but can't fully. Like, for me, I want to say some of the comedy feels Marx Brothers inspired, sans Harpo, but then that isn't really right. And at the same time I want to say the quirkiness feels like a something Woody Allen would produce, but the characters are too interesting to be part of a Woody Allen movie, so this film can truly only be described as a Wes Anderson original which is very hard to exactly compare.Characters & StoryAt the heart of the story, we learn about the life of Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) during his younger years when he was simply known as Zero (Tony Revolori), a lobby boy for The Grand Budapest Hotel during the time when M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) was concierge. His tale is laced with romance, filled with drama, and a bit of heartbreak too.The romance deals with his love for Agatha (Saoirse Ronan), and Gustave's love for old women; the drama deals with when one of Gustave's admirers Madame D (Tilda Swinton). dies and bestows something to him which angers her children, but none more than Dmitri (Adrien Brody) who with the help of his man for hire Jopling (Willem Dafoe), seems to do everything possible so that not only would Dmitri and his sisters would gain the entire fortune, but erase anyone who could stop them. As for the heartbreak, I'll leave that for you to witness.PraiseI don't think it would be too far fetch to say that Wes Anderson, thus far, hasn't made a lot of movies which could be considered mainstream. However, I think this film could have a bit of universal appeal, and not just because the actors Anderson uses have increasingly been more and more famous since he has last worked with them. Part of the reason I think this has mainstream appeal is because it is very comical. Gustave is a highly likable character who Fiennes plays so wonderfully that I'd hope he at least get a Golden Globe nomination next year. Alongside that, the story, after you get past it being a story, within a story, within a story, is quite entertaining. Be it Gustave's hijinks as he steals a painting and escapes prison; Gustave and Zero's relationship which is noted to be a brotherhood, but more so comes off like a father and son type relationship; or the dozens of characters which each have distinct personalities which make it so none of them fully leave your memory when all is said and done. To me, though the tried and true fans may say his other works maybe better, this one is the best to me, so far.CriticismWhen it comes to criticism though, thinking about the movie as a whole, I can't really say there is any glaring issue. If anything, my issue was the fact I had to travel far to see this, but that is more a personal issue than anything dealing with the film. Overall: Worth SeeingThough not overtly funny, it is because it isn't trying to make up for a weak story by having over the top comedy. This film has moments which will at the very least make most smile, and for some make them laugh out loud. Combine that with a touching relationship between lobby boy and concierge, and the movie feeling strangely short, you will be left with fond memories and may even want to see this again for the dialog was very quotable and well written. Hence why I say this is worth seeing.",9,1,6,25 May 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," When it comes to Marvel, rarely is anything over-hyped and with Guardians of the Galaxy they present a new franchise for movie fans to commit to.
","Truly, the testament of what makes Marvel films good is that they combine summer blockbuster action, the type of comedy you would expect to come from professional comedians, and the type of moving performances that usually are held until winter's Oscar season. And with Guardians of the Galaxy, things are no different. For it truly shows why DC comic book adaptations, despite having the big names of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, have always found themselves following behind Marvel's lead. To learn why this film continues to keep Marvel on a high pedestal: read below.Characters & StoryPeter Quill (Chris Pratt) on the day his mother dies is kidnapped by a group known as 'The Ravagers' led by a man named Yondu (Michael Rooker) who somehow went from abductor to father figure. Which led Peter to become a smuggler like his surrogate father until he came across Kree representative Korath (Djimon Hounsou) who crosses paths with Peter when trying to obtain this spirit stone. Something which is of great power so when he evades Korath, the Kree send Gamora (Zoe Saldana) after Peter and the orb which contains the spirit stone. Though she isn't the only one looking for Peter. Due to Peter deciding to screw over Yondu, two mutants: Groot (Vin Diesel), a mutant tree, and Rocket (Bradley Cooper), a raccoon who seems to have been some sicko's science project, are after him because Yondu put a bounty on Peter.And together, upon first meeting, they all fight, quarrel, and then all land in prison. That is where they meet Drax (Dave Bautista) who, like the rest of the guardians, has lost a lot in his life. But with the threat of Ronan (Lee Pace) and Gamora's sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), as well as Thanos (Josh Brolin), this group finds themselves bonding together in order to seek revenge, redemption, and save the planet of Xandar from its doom. That is, unless Ronan and Thanos overwhelm them.PraiseIt is very weird for me to cry, laugh, and be on the edge of my seat while watching a film. Yet, between Peter, Drax, and Rocket, I found myself crying multiple times as we learn their back story. Then, with the same group, including Groot, a few scenes later I would be laughing either because of most of the guardians not getting Peter's jokes or symbols, the antics of Rocket, or just the sweet, simple nature of Groot which made him perhaps the most lovable out of all of them. Though when it comes to the action, I must admit it wasn't as good as the other aspects of the film, but between the hand to hand combat, space battles, and the futuristic technology wielded by both heroes and villains, it meets the standard you expect out of a Marvel film.Though, as a whole, the story is what really deserves praise, as well as the actors whose performances make it so good! For while I didn't know a damn thing about the Guardians of the Galaxy, I felt like it had the right balance for a novice, and would likely appease those of the fan base. For almost every character you get to know on an intimate level to the point where you aren't just laughing because they are funny, or sad because of them going into their back story, but you also sometimes tear up just because you think they may actually die or because you can see how much of a family they become to each other. One which may not replace the ones they lost, but are more than capable of taking up the time those who passed on would have occupied.CriticismAs someone who doesn't watch a huge amount of action movies, I must admit I didn't like how over the top, if not stiff some of the stunts were. Especially with Gamora who not only is given the short end of the stick when it comes to character development, but also her action scenes are subpart when compared to the guys. Then, on top of that, most of the fights aren't the type where you get a Game of Thrones type vibe where you think anyone can die. Which is only an issue for me because it makes every fight scene feel like you are watching an extreme WWE match.Though, refocusing on Gamora, and Saldana in extension, I must say in comparison to Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow there is a clear lack of investment in this character. For, out of everyone, she doesn't hardly get any jokes, kick ass fights, and if it wasn't for the fact she got a lukewarm back story and fought with the rest of the guardians, she would damn near be your usual action movie love interest who fell for the guy she found herself changing/ giving something to fight for. Overall: Worth SeeingLike most Marvel movies before it, you are presented with top quality action and effects, more laughs than you average comedy, and more reasons to cry than your Oscar winning drama. I mean, this film is so good it makes you want to do more than follow the series, but look into who wrote it so that you can see more of their style in the future. That to me is how good this film is, and why it is Worth Seeing. For while the action may not have been in my taste, and Gamora's development and fight scenes were sub-par compared to the guys, my issues with the film I'd say are solely about preference more than anything else.",8,2,5,3 August 2014
Logan," Overall: Positive (Worth Seeing)
","While the villains were as dull and expendable as any Marvel film, this one had more emotional depth and development than probably any you could name. Well, outside of Spiderman. Hopefully signaling that there might be a change to the Marvel formula. If not, at the very least, how FOX will handle the X-Men franchise going forward.",8,1,6,2 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age of Ultron maybe one of the first of Marvel's films to show why making each film part of one long arcing story may not be the best ideas.
","Once again the Avengers assembly and, at first, it is against Hydra, Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor- Johnson). However, with time, and Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) trying to create some sort of retirement plan, comes the birth of Ultron (James Spader). A being made to stop wars before they begin, and the only way it sees to do so is to end the human race. Something The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and Captain America (Chris Evans), alongside Iron Man, and the various sidekicks, plan to stop. That is if they can.PraiseLike with any Marvel film, there are comedic moments, the type of sci-fi which helps show what a 200 million dollar budget looks like, and of course, we have iconic characters brought to life in glorious fashion. Though perhaps the best parts deal with the idea of the team splitting apart. For while everyone has always been united against a foreign evil, with this film comes the idea that, past certain personality conflicts, there are true, irreconcilable, differences between everyone. Leading to the idea that, especially in MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) movies to come, that perhaps nothing will remain as one-sided for the perception of good and bad will be severely blurred.CriticismBeing that everything within the MCU is pre-planned, and the source material is accessible to the public, it makes films like these seem more so like stepping stones than grandeur monuments within a series. For example, one of the next major films to be released as part of the MCU, after Ant-Man, is Captain America: Civil War in which we'll find Tony and Captain America on opposing ends of an issue, and it seems a good bit of the film is dedicated more to setting up their eventually battle than trying to craft Ultron into any sort of interesting, or truly credible, villain. Especially considering Thanos continues to lurk in the background, making damn near every villain, outside of Loki, to just seem to be a placeholder. Making it so I almost was left wondering if it wasn't for the expectations built by knowing what is to come, would this film even be interesting? Of which the answer ultimately was: no. For while Marvel always puts out quality entertainment, at times it does feel like it has found a comfort zone, which you've grown accustomed to, that makes it so you eventually need and expect more. After all, it has been 7 years since the first Iron Man and Marvel began this one universe strategy and, while both critically and financially successful, at this point there is a need for a serious jolt. No more, I feel, can Marvel rely on interchangeable villains, and slightly different love interest/ comic relief characters amongst their films. The formula has to be changed. Otherwise, even with the large amount of source material, and both famous, and cult favorites, amongst their archives, eventually the empire will fall. Overall: TV ViewingGranted, this is a good film, and achieves all you would expect from a Marvel film, but after a certain point, and after seeing the movies, the S.H.I.E.L.D TV show, and maybe also the animated series or movies, you have to wonder if perhaps we have seen the best Marvel can offer? For with Age of Ultron, we seem to have hit a plateau. We know of the great effects the production teams can muster; we know the screenplay writers can craft jokes and help flesh out characters which don't ultimately seem like shallow demi-gods; and with the knowledge of there always being a future, one which can pursue the idea of our heroes becoming villains, there is always something which can be done to revive the MCU. However, with a movie like Age of Ultron, the question remains: Should everything, until Thanos become the central villain, perhaps only be seen as filler or just a stepping stone; Will, even as new characters are introduced, should we pretty much just expect the same formula to be used repeatedly ad nausea; or will, one day, Marvel will find itself breaking ground once more, with its storytelling, and not just box office records? Only time will tell.",7,0,2,5 October 2016
La La Land," A light-hearted drama which maybe selling point is a reminder of why musicals used to be a staple in Hollywood's golden age.
","Review (with Spoilers)Noted Actor(s)Mia (Emma Stone) & Sebastian (Ryan Gosling)StorylineA struggling actress and a struggling jazz pianist. One too many chance encounters lead them to actual pursue each other's company and make a vested interest in each other. But, like with any film dealing with romance, as things change, dreams are realized or die, can the relationship still survive?HighlightsEmma StoneWith no shade to Ryan Gosling, this movie was really about Stone. Her charm was on high, those big doe eyes of hers were in full effect, and she had the same comic appeals which made her a star in Easy A. Though what really made this a highlight is Stone wasn't tasked with trying to break the mold on what we know her for and as. What I mean by that is, she isn't suddenly trying to pull a Tilda Swinton or Meryl Streep out of her back pocket. She pushes the boundary of what we may expect from her, but not so much that it would look like she is trying to prove something. Like, this film doesn't seem like she is out here trying to prove she is a serious actress who shouldn't be pigeonholed. She knows what she is good at and expands on what we are used to seeing by adding song and dance numbers. Alongside giving a bit more depth to her character than we are used to. Allowing you more so to ease into the idea that she may not always choose to be a goof ball, romantic interest, or the supporting role to a stronger character.The Dance and Music NumbersTo be honest, I wasn't walking into this movie thinking or knowing it was a musical. I knew Stone would be singing music and Gosling would play a piano, but I wasn't expecting at least 5 or 6 verbal songs and a lot of jazz music. On top of that, I wasn't expecting tap dance numbers and things of that nature. But, let me tell you, they were such a welcomed surprise. For while Gosling you expect to be adept at it since he grew up in the house of mouse, Stone does seem like the type with two left feet and who sings off pitch for fun. Plus, you'd kind of expect her to be tone deaf.Truth is, Stone gives as good as Gosling when it comes to the dance numbers and watching them move together reminds you why, for decades, one of the main exports out of Hollywood were grandeur musicals. For the songs, oh the songs. Whether Gosling's jazz music, of which a song or two feature John Legend, or listening to Stone sing, you could go from something that makes you want to groove, to perhaps cry, and maybe even want a nap. It's such a whirlwind that you do get to understand why so many nominations are being announced for this movie and why it is being awarded accolades.CriticismOne Key Question About Them Goes UnansweredConflict is necessary in any movie and with romantic movies, the conflict is usually somewhere out of left field and is usually the low point. This movie, despite everything else, is no different. The problem is, why we are made aware of what may have caused the major rift, but there is no exact detail. Did they grow apart, did their careers just consume so much of their time they broke up and decided to become friends? Friends which kept aware of what the other was doing but didn't have much communication (think friends you had in high school or college you are connected with on social media but never speak to). This isn't answered. We are just teased with a possible way the movie could end which for some maybe unrealistic.Overall: Positive (Worth Seeing) - RecommendedIf I was to be perfectly honest, if Stone wins an award for this it is because of her doing a golden age of Hollywood-style musical and because of her charm. Acting wise, while this character has more depth and consistent growth than her past roles, she isn't at that point yet where she really grabs you. She is still is one of the most entertaining actresses of this generation, but this is but a taste of what is to come more so than perhaps the best she may ever put out there. As for Gosling, he kind of is forgettable. The movie does its best to keep him from being a second fiddle with bringing in a sister for him, an old friend in John Legend's character and giving him a life outside Mia, but ultimate Stone eclipses him in almost all aspects outside of the song and dance numbers. In those moments, they are equals and they make this movie more than just another romantic film. They remind you of the actors of yore who could sing, dance, act, and tell a quality joke. Something sorely missed and why I fully expect to probably watch this more than once in my lifetime.",9,2,7,7 December 2016
12 Years a Slave," With this film, slavery is truly defined, seen, and felt. It sets a precedent you hope no film ever tries to match.
","To be honest, I am not sure why as a Black male I subject myself to watching films focused on slavery. You learn about it in school, hear about it from parents and grandparents, and the internet is filled with pictures which make you internally grateful you are born in this day and age. Yet still, something draws you in like the advertisement of horror movies. You know you'll be frightened, but not by some crazed, sometimes mystical, being, but by something that you only missed out on by 2-4 generations.In the movie, to me there is only a handful who really stand out worth noting. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup naturally stands out, for he is the lead who we watch live 12 years with swaying hope, a consistent sense of pride, and a tongue which constantly makes you think he has a death wish. Joining him is Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps, who pretty much is despicable that you hope you get to see him die violently, brutally, and to the point he can't be recognized. Alongside Edwin is his wife Mary Epps, played by Sarah Paulson, of American Horror Story fame, who, at best, is like a mad dog barking, but rarely having the guts to bite. Then, in my opinion, the only person left worth mentioning is Lupita Nyong'o's Patsey, a young girl who works hard and who finally represents the often ignored plight of a Black woman enslaved on a plantation.As for the story, we cover Solomon's journey from a freeman to a slave. During this journey we see a man who had an education, skills, and a sense of being dignified, be dehumanized to the point where you realize that, even now, no matter what type of paper you hold, be it one saying you are a freeman, equal citizen, or what have you, it doesn't change the color of your skin and the way others perceive, and will treat you, because of it. Luckily for us though, 12 years fly by and though brutality is in every other scene, the pain is shared and Solomon does have some moments when he gets even the most minuscule of victories.Now, I am well aware of the many praises of the film there are, and while some of it is definitely granted, in other areas I feel iffy. But, to start off, I believe there is so much praise that should be bestowed on Lupita Nyong'o. Though this is Solomon's narrative, her character at times steals any feelings you'd think you should have, or do have, for Solomon. She makes your body shake, your face tense, and may make tears fall from your eyes. As for Chiwetel Ejiofor, I must admit I didn't think much of his performance for most of the movie, but as the movie comes to an end you realize why. To me, it was because of a sense of empathy to the point of being sometimes like stigmata. Solomon has to numb himself so much to keep hope that you end up numbing your emotions as well. However, when there is a rope around his neck, you do feel your collar tighten; when he is beaten and healing from his wounds, you start to become uncomfortable in your chair like sitting against something, no matter how soft, is just masochism; and though you are given many reasons to cry, you suck it up for you know it won't do much for you to shed tears. But, during the final scene, when the self-induced Novocain wears off, you shed tears like he does and let go of all that you've held in throughout the movie and even find your body, as you leave, numb and shaky from trying to keep your composure, as Solomon had to for most of the movie. Which leads to me going into what didn't work with the film, of which there isn't a lot. The first thing I must note is that it seems the film tries to pull a Django at times by having Solomon fight back or talk slick, giving him a moment where he outwits his slavers and gives you some relief from him being continuously forced to be subservient. Such, at least I felt, seemed a bit unreal and it, to a small point, diminished the would-be villains, like Fassbender's Edwin Epps, a bit. Though I must not Edwin quickly reasserts himself. Outside of that though, the only issue I could have is that for most of the movie you may find it hard to connect to Solomon, or realize you are doing it. Because of that, you more easily attach yourself to other slaves' stories, especially the women like Lupita Nyong'o's and Adepero Oduye's characters. Oduye plays a slave named Eliza in the film. Because of this be it Eliza, Patsey, or even Alfre Woodard's character Mistress Shaw, Solomon's story becomes less of an interest and you end up wanting to learn about these women much more. Perhaps though that is more a praise to the women than a criticism though.Overall: Worth SeeingTo me, this is a film you see once and never again. It is brutal, graphic, and I personally found it triggering my freedom and Civil Rights were given only a few years ago. And it really does touch you that deeply too, and whether you are a man and end up feeling Solomon's pain or take on the pain of the Eliza or Patsey, you don't leave the film without being the least bit scathed. Which is why I say it is worth seeing. Nyong'o surely gives an award worthy performance which thinking about makes my breaths shallow and eyes begin to water. Ejiofor holds his own as well, but he is definitely put in Nyong'o's shadow. This isn't to say though he surely doesn't deserve accolades.",9,7,14,18 October 2013
Sausage Party," This is the story of how food learned the truth of their fate and when they fought back.
","It was all just a dream. One day, in the great beyond, the place outside the supermarket doors, Frank would finally be between Brenda. Oh, he has dreamed of it so long, being between her buns, and she has dreamed of having him inside her. But then Honey Mustard (Danny McBride) ruins everything. He plants the idea in Frank's head that the great beyond is a lie and as he attempts to commit suicide Frank saves him and Brenda tries to save Frank from falling. Alas, Honey Mustard falls to his death and alongside Frank and Brenda, many other food items meet end up on the floor and fear that now they may never meet the great beyond.But alas, there is hope! All Frank and Brenda need to do is stuff themselves in another package. Nevermind they have to trek the floor and will likely be dirty because they must meet the great beyond by any means necessary. But Honey Mustard's last words live on. In fact, they haunt Frank so much that he seeks out Firewater (Bill Hader) to learn the truth. Something he, nor his fellow food items, are ready for.Commentary43 times. I laughed 43 times during this movie. I laughed to the point is hurt a little bit. Yet, at times I felt bad about laughing for while the food puns, like the one Douche (Nick Kroll), did were hilarious, most of the jokes were at the expense of food with various ethnicities. Jewish and Arabian jokes were in full force, alongside stereotypical Black jokes, Native American jokes, and there is even German food which has a Hitler-esque leader.To say the least, while Rogen and company have always been vulgar, it does seem this movie kind of was digging at the bottom of the barrel. Especially since, while there was some attempt at social commentary with the war between Jewish and Arabian food, for the most part, this movie is just about making you laugh at stupid things. Which there is nothing wrong with, but is a bit disappointing since films starring Seth Rogen usually seem to attempt to be about more than just that.Things To NotePrepare to have your jaw drop as you watch a food orgy.Low PointsOne of the main things I've always liked about Seth Rogen films is that alongside a guarantee of laughter, there is usually some heart. You feel for the characters, see them grow, and it makes it so a sensitive soul may even get a little teary-eyed. With this film, though, the main objective is to make a funny, R-rated animated comedy. Yes, the food is being eaten and they look at it as murder. Yes, there is some attempts with the food to try to speak on racial and ethnic tension and how we should all work well together. However, you can't even say working in those topics and ideas was a secondary objective. If anything, it is like the thought came up, there may have been some discussion on how to pursue the complexities of all these different cultures, but at a certain point there was a deadline and they just decided it isn't worth exploring. After all, why ruin a politically incorrect movie with a bunch of kumbaya nonsense? My point is, the film meets its expectations of being funny, but I felt slightly disappointed by the lukewarm attempt to make this film about more than jokes. Something I feel is part of Rogen's signature style when it comes to films he stars in.On The FenceAs offensive as this can come off, one can argue that this goes by the Seth McFarlane style of comedy in which everyone is going to be aimed at and laughed at. Be it Mexicans and Hispanics, Black people, Jews, people of central Eurasian descent, Asians, gay people, and probably more, everyone is an equal opportunity target. Which doesn't necessarily takeaway from the tired stereotypes used in this movie, but who watches a comedy nowadays expecting them to be clean and inoffensive? Such a thing requires more effort and talent than most modern comedians have.",7,17,36,13 August 2016
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Wolf of Wall Street, undoubtedly is one of Leo's best performances, and makes it seem that Oscar may finally be in his grasp.
","When Martin Scorsese puts his name on a film, you know that quality is to be expected. Then, with his most recent muse Leonardo DiCaprio being in the lead role, it is almost impossible to imagine them working together leading to something horrible. After all, they are like a more refined, and dependable, version of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.Characters & StoryAs for the film, the story focuses on one Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who is this highly charismatic man whose ability to inspire is comparable to that of the great villains of history or literature. However, like many villains, things didn't start off with him going down the wrong path. When we first meet Jordan, he may not be a saint, but his conscious is clean. He has a wife Teresa (played by Cristin Milioti), and simply wants to live a life where monetary worries are something which are foreign and something simply seen on the news. So, with his first entry level job he meets a man named Mark Hanna (played by Matthew McConaughey) who not only mentors him, but is the figure which begins to change Jordan from the man Teresa fell in love with, to a character who you can't take your eyes off of.Unfortunately for Jordan though, after finally passing his series 7 exam, to be an official stockbroker, Black Monday happens. With this event, Jordan is out of a job and Mark is out of his life. However, with Mark introducing him to the taste of the life he always wanted, and Jordan having that old school American, pull yourself up by the bootstraps, mentality, he decides to not let this setback kill his vision of the new American dream: getting rich. So, he first starts out doing penny stocks and then begins building an empire with his workers being the downtrodden of the world, making him rise to a level where he almost seems like Hitler without an army or anti-Semitic views. Alongside him is a man who helps see his dreams come true, and push them to ruin: Donnie Azoff (played by Jonah Hill). Making for an overall adventure in which we see the usual dramatic rise and disastrous fall of a figure who may have gotten beaten, but seemingly gets the last laugh and lives to fight another day. PraiseFirst and foremost, there is an obligatory need to praise Leonardo DiCaprio for he will keep you entertained for the full three hours of the film. Through breaking the 4th wall, and all different types of debauchery which usually is only seen on HBO or Showtime shows, we are given a 3D character. One who has all the charm needed to trick people out of money, but at the same time seems like the life he lives and the person he is at heart are continually conflicting with each other. I say that since, despite the yacht, massive ego, and the ability to make a million in a day, there is still this sort of vulnerability, if only slightly. Take note of whenever he is looking at a woman as more than a vagina to stick his dick in, he becomes insecure in almost an inexperienced teen way, making it seem like testosterone is able to create a façade for when it is time to show off, but during intimate moments, the mask comes off and all that is left is a man with money and ambitions, but someone who also desires someone stable to share all of his profit with too.But it isn't just DiCaprio who gives you an excellent performance. Hill, based off his filmography, seems almost destined to play Azoff, and though he may not go head to head with DiCaprio in terms of prominence, it is hard to deny that as a supporting member, he doesn't do a hell of a job. Also, I quite admired the use of soul/ blues music throughout the film signaling the shift of Belfort's rise, and perhaps the best thing about the film is that while it isn't rolling on the floor funny, it does keep you smiling and entertained all throughout.CriticismLeading to perhaps the sole criticism I have for this movie: The Ending. Our journey with Belfort creates the type of movie you can foresee watching more than once, just because of all the madness that goes on; however, the ending just feels so anti-climactic after everything that is done. You watch the man throw midgets, money launder, have sex with tons of woman, take as much drugs as possible without having an overdose, and though I realize Belfort, the actual Jordan Belfort, is alive so a definitive ending isn't possible, I just felt like after skyrocketing and maintaining that altitude, the ending feels like a plane nose-diving and just barely making it onto the runway safe.Overall: Must SeeI personally am not a huge Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but it is undeniable that his work with Martin Scorsese took him from Jack in Titanic to a mega star. Whatever it is, Scorsese brings out the best out of DiCaprio the same way he did with Robert De Niro for decades. And with that said, this movie is something not only worth seeing in theaters, but eventually getting on DVD. For while it is 3 hours long, like Blue is the Warmest Color, it uses said 3 hours to give you a compelling story which rarely, if ever, falters. I would even dare say, even amongst Idris Elba, Michael B. Jordan and Chiwetel Ejiofor, Leornardo DiCaprio may finally get an Oscar.",9,2,15,25 December 2013
Straight Outta Compton," Straight Outta Compton presents what happens when Hip-Hop artist get the budget they want for their biopics, and end up with too much control over how their stories are told.
","While the film is certainly too grandeur to seem like something VH1 would produce as an original movie, all the flashiness, nudity, and jokes, don't necessarily elevate this film into something which should be taken as a serious film. For with so much nudity that this damn near seems like the soft core porn HBO and Cinemax have late at night, with a better story; and it seeming that none of the NWA members are ever taken to task for their less than scrupulous past, to truly call this a biopic would be a bit of a joke.With that said though, it is a very entertaining movie and does remain consistently engaging over its two hour length. Something which cannot be said for too many films. However, being that the film tries to rewrite history by making it seem NWA was just a bunch of young men whose lives were about getting out of the hood, getting laid, making money, making music, and dealing with police harassment, it becomes far too difficult to say this is Worth Seeing. Hence the TV Viewing label for the movie does hold far too much back, likely for the sake of Dr. Dre and Ice Cube's current images, and being that the emotional scenes don't hit you hard in the gut, Straight Outta Compton just ultimately seems like a TV movie which had the type of budget hardly any network would ever approve for the subject matter.",8,12,46,15 August 2015
Saving Mr. Banks," Saving Mr. Banks is a tear jerker dealing with one man's promise to his daughters and one woman's grief over her father.
","Being someone who has liked Emma Thompson since seeing Wit and Love Actually, I found it hard to not look forward to the film. And then when you add Tom Hanks and the story of the making of Mary Poppins, it is hard not to get excited. But, the best part though is, unlike last year's Hitchcock, as much as you get a story about the creator, there is a proper focus on the making of the film. Well, rather the writing part of it.Characters & Story The story focuses on Pamela Travers (played by Emma Thompson), the writer of Mary Poppins, the book. She has the personality of an English school teacher whose students would call her a spinster and fellow teachers a hard ass. But, while presented as a highly sarcastic woman, we also see in her younger self (played by Annie Rose Buckley) a child who saw the downfall of her family, including her father. But, from that terrible time in Pamela's life came the inspiration for Mary Poppins, a tale about a woman who may not have saved her from what was going on, but did so much for her life that now she is almost like what a stuffed animal would be for a child. However, with the book published to the world, now one Walt Disney (played by Tom Hanks) wishes to take that story, put it to film, add music and even a touch of animation, most of which is loathsome to Pamela. However, with money low and Travers growing tired of Disney's 20 year pursuit, she does everything she can to convince him to break his promise to his girls, and as she goes through the motions she reflects on what inspired Mary Poppins. Be it her father (played by Colin Farrell) or her aunt Ellie (played by Rachel Griffiths), we see what trauma and difficulties that led to the iconic character.Praise When it comes to praise, the first thing I must note is that the story mixes the pre-production part of making the movie Mary Poppins well with establishing what inspired the book. This is thanks to a combination of Buckley and Farrell setting up the type of foundation which allows you to eventually emotionally connect to Thompson as the adult version of Pamela Travers. You see, the flashbacks to Pamela's childhood often are used to explain different parts of the movie, so when it comes to certain aspects, like Mr. Banks being a banker like her dad, this triggers something in her which leads her to reminisce to scenes which often begin to make you feel empathy for the often polarizing Pamela.Also, I feel there is a need to praise the fact almost every main character is written with their own life, even if they aren't a recognizable name. For example, we know who Walt Disney is, as well as Pamela Travers because they are the two title characters, but even someone like Paul Giamatti's character Ralph is given a back-story by being the father to a girl in a wheelchair. And with that, you feel that you are getting a somewhat true slice of what was going on during the times. Which, by the way, during the credits they show pictures of Walt and Pamela, as well as feature a recording session when Pamela was meeting with the writers about the script.Criticism Now, when it comes to critiquing the film, perhaps the only thing worth critiquing is that sometimes I did feel like I wanted to learn more about Walt Disney than Pamela Travers. The reason I say this is mostly because Tom Hanks does seem to, at times, steal a scene or two to the point it does make you imagine what a Walt Disney biopic would look like. Then, to add onto that, though probably fitting for the times, you do get the slightest hint of sexism every now and then. Not strong enough to cause an uproar, but enough, even from Walt Disney, to make you raise an eyebrow.Overall: Worth Seeing It is rare for me to see a film and want to read the source material after. However, after seeing Saving Mr. Banks I do feel the desire to read the original book, and watch the Julie Andrews movie in order to fully understand how many of her complaints made sense. Outside of that, I do feel this is a movie worth seeing because every bit of the movie plays up the actors strengths, and backs it up with good writing. Thompson plays Pamela Travers, as a misunderstood woman who hasn't much but her literary classic, so well that, with Annie Rose Buckley's help, she pulls off a wonderful performance; Tom Hanks, as always, is a likable fellow who plays a good supporting role in the film; and it is hard to say that one character wasn't treated like they were a human being, even if we didn't get a full story on their life. Hence why I am saying it is worth watching. There is nothing really bad about it, and if anything it develops hope to see more about those who took in Disney films, as well as seeing, eventually, a Walt Disney biopic.",8,1,3,14 December 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Thor is very much an action/ comedy but, like most Marvel films, it has a sense of interdependency in which the hero is nothing without their allies.
","Let me start off right the bat saying I wasn't originally going to see this movie. This is despite me loving Marvel franchises like X-Men and Spiderman, but for whatever reason those who comprise the Avengers just never screamed, 'see me opening weekend!' for reasons I don't understand. Still, for the sake of getting out the house I saw this and was sort of surprised by the end result.Characters & StoryAs many know, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) is the god of thunder and the hero of the film. Alongside him is his love interest Jane (played by Natalie Portman) who is an astrophysicist who, like most love interest, act as much as a liability as an asset; then we have the scene commanding Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) who often is the most interesting character in the film since he has good action scenes, comedic moments, and brings many questions to the story; then there is the last big character of the film, to me anyway, the villain Malakith (played by Christopher Exxleston) who is sort of your generic villain hell-bent on destroying the world, without any unique traits to make him stand out amongst the many villains of the Marvel universe. Outside of those mentioned, there is Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) who is Thor's father and king of Asgard; Heimdall (played by Idris Elba) who seems to be the watcher of the various realms Asgard rules over; and then there is Darcy (played by Kat Dennings) who I only mention since she and Loki brings the majority of the laughs in the film.Now, in terms of story, they first establish, especially for people like me, the power and might of Thor as he tries to unite all the realms. Then, and this is not in exact order, we watch Jane try to move on from Thor, and do research, which leads her to discovering something called 'The Aether' a magic mist which has the power to return the world to darkness, the way it was assumingly before the big bang. Her discovery of this magic awakens Malekith and leads Thor to bringing her to Asgard to be protected but, being that this movie has to fill nearly two hours, naturally they beat the hell out of Thor and Asgard, and then bring in Loki to help get revenge. From there, things are taken to Earth and then the final battle goes back and forth between Earth and The Dark World.PraiseSomething you'll find in 90% of all Marvel films, and most comic book adaptations nowadays, is there is a mix of comedy, drama and some comedic moments. For Thor: The Dark World, they do a tightrope balance of all three and do so with the type of skill which seems almost unnatural. The reason I say that is I haven't seen the first, but watching this made me feel like I was watching an action/ comedy which easily could slip into dramedy, and then back. The comedy itself though was a real highlight for Loki and Darcy made it so those maybe not into the action of Thor story got a few laughs, and then the action had mutilations, epic scenery and sometimes I felt I was watching a Dragon Ball Z crossover. Perhaps though the best thing was the writing when it came to Loki. Needless to say, as much as this film made Hemsworth the star amongst his brothers, Hiddleston is the true breakout star in my opinion, and the movie takes full advantage of his talents. Be it his comedic moments, dramatic moments, or the air of mystery they put in what happens to him, you are left with questions which perhaps can only be answered in another sequel.CriticismWhich leads to the handful of criticism that can be given to this movie, of which there is very few. Perhaps the one big criticism is the villain has no personality and though he does something which involves killing a major character, at the same time you can understand why other franchises like X-Men and Spiderman came before Thor since based off this villain alone, it makes it seem like you have this great hero, but no formidable opponents to really challenge him. Then, I must admit that while I liked the action scenes, I did feel the comedy took away a bit from the some of the scenes. For, even in the final fight, they take a comedic break and then the action goes on once more. It makes it so, for me, it seems like they were trying to make the film so universally likable, they took away from what perhaps is the main selling point.Overall: Worth SeeingI'll admit, after seeing this I do wanna see the first, even if just for Loki. For, this film may not be on the iconic status like The Dark Knight, but it sets out to entertain you and does just that. Then, as an added bonus, it has some diversity. There are villains and heroes which are a good mix of people of color and different genders, and the mere view of the worlds they live in is awe-inspiring. Lastly, I must mention there are two post credit scenes. One which is worth waiting for, and the very last one, at the end of all the cast and crew, which isn't a big deal.",8,3,7,10 November 2013
Lucy," A young woman is forced to become a drug mule, but when the drugs leak she is given the capability of using 100% of her brain function.
","When it comes to actresses, Scarlett Johansson is probably one the most consistent. For whether she is in the Marvel blockbusters, films like Her, or even films like Don Jon, she not only finds herself in good movies, but also movies where the female lead isn't regulated to solely being a generic love interest. Her roles usually transcend expectations by presenting social commentary; presenting new angles to the love interest archetype; or being a woman who not only kicks ass, but also has a personality. Focusing on Lucy, the best way to think of Johansson in this film is to look at how Angelina Jolie was when she did a lot of action movies.Characters & StoryFrom what we can tell, Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is on vacation in Taiwan and has found herself a boyfriend in Richard (Pilou Asbaek) who is a bit shady. So shady that after dating Lucy for a week he asks of her to deliver something to a man named Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi), of which he won't reveal what she is delivering. And being that she maybe blonde but not stupid, she says she isn't for delivering something she doesn't know the contents of. But, with Richard handcuffing her to the briefcase with the stuff, and only Mr. Jang having the code to unlock the case and give her freedom, she is forced to see the mysterious mobster leading to her becoming a drug mule who accidentally ends up feeling the full effect of the product she was supposed to smuggle. Thus allowing for her to develop X-Men type powers of which she needs Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) to help her understand for as much as her brain function becomes an asset, it also poses as a liability.PraiseAs Angelina Jolie exits being the queen of the action genre, it seems Johansson is more than capable of taking her throne. But while Jolie relied on her fierce capabilities, as much as her sexuality, Johansson as Lucy is more so focused on doing what is needed to survive, as well as understand her increasing capabilities. Of which leads to use seeing her powers which are so extraordinary that you have to give it to the stunt team and visual effects artist for between dismantling guns with her mind, going back through time, and then the fight scenes. Johansson may not be as agile in the film as she is within the Marvel universe, but what she lacks in acrobatic maneuvers she makes up in by coming off as an utter bad ass.Lastly, I must say the film did contain a bit of humor which had a Marvel vibe to it. You know, the type of humor which sort of feels out of place and just shakes things up so you don't feel as if it is just Lucy traveling, shooting people, using her powers, and repeat.CriticismAs for the story, it tests your ignorance on the brain's capabilities a bit and tries to create this idea where if you used 20% more brain power you would start to become like Professor X, or another mental power focused mutant. Which, again, leads to cool visual effect tricks, but by the end of the film the story does begin to just seem like it is losing its ability to be compelling and is just about ready to veer off a cliff.Though perhaps the main issue I had was with us seeing the full capabilities of Lucy's powers. If just because some of them just don't seem believable. For example, she somehow is capable of hacking a TV, radio, and Professor Norman's cell phone from Taiwan while he is in Paris; she can touch someone, sometimes not even touching their skin, to read their minds; and yet is so destructive. Which I found to be a sort of plot hole because it made it seem she was selective to use the powers which would make sense. Like, she has high reflexes right, can life things with her mind, and has hacking abilities, so explain to me why she is causing multiple car accidents when she could just switch traffic lights to be in her favor, life cars, and keep it moving? Also, why does she kill people when she has the power to change people minds, much less she could just break their limbs? Then, there is the question of why she let Mr. Jang chase her all over the world and not wipe his memories? And it is just little stuff like that, which you think about after the movie is over, which sort of ruins the experience a little bit.Overall: TV ViewingWhat makes this a TV Viewing film is because it does show itself as something different by not having Johansson simply be some sexy action star, but with that comes her going from this innocent girl to being a cold calculated robot which kills a lot of her charisma. Then, on top of that, the story itself, even if you aren't that heavy into biology, feels like it pushes the idea of what the human brain is capable of past what it likely can do. Add on that her powers aren't utilized in such a way which makes sense and you are left with a film which is good enough to watch, but isn't worth putting on your to watch list. For while the visual effects are cool, and there are nice comedic moments filtered throughout, by the end it the movie loses a lot of its luster and thankfully ends before it fully wears out its welcome. Hence the TV viewing label.",8,3,14,28 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," If you watched episodes IV, V, and VI, Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens may seem almost like a reboot, or re-imagining, of the original trilogy.
","-Highlights- *When it comes to Rey, I feel like she represents a modern female action hero. She isn't dainty, but isn't mannish; not focused on falling in love, yet desires close relationships and loyalty; but perhaps what I loved the most about this girl is she was a bad ass. I mean, between chasing people down, fighting with her rod, or being a co-pilot to Han Solo (Harrison Ford) or Chewy (Peter Mayhew), I honestly feel the franchise is in safe hands as she learns the ways of the force.*While Kylo Ren, or Ben, is no Darth Vader, I do like how he sort of represents the ideal transition from the end of episode 3, when Anakin becomes Vader, to before Vader becomes the menace of the galaxy. For with him trying to prove himself, impress his father figure, and discard his old life, it is like getting a taste of Vader's early years as an apprentice with potential.*For those who missed comedic moments in the franchise, between Han Solo and Rey, you are going to get what you asked for. That, alongside Storm Troopers reacting to the madness which is working around someone with anger issues like Kylo Ren.*As anyone familiar with Star Wars may know, the movies are all long as hell. However, between the nostalgia, the action, and to the point dialogue, there isn't any length of time in which you end up wanting to check your watch to see if it is over yet.*As noted with The Expanse, there is something about diversity when it comes to sci- fi that is so necessary and welcomed. For, between Rey, who is a bad ass heroine; Finn, who is a decent side kick, and possible love interest for Rey by the end of the trilogy; and then how diverse the resistance is, as well as The First Order having a female captain in Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), it is hard to not smile at the fact that while Star Wars has kept a lot of what made it originally popular, it has adapted to the times a bit.-Low Points- *In most movies, murder isn't something really noted. Yet in this film it is by Finn, and is one of the main reasons he decides to leave The First Order. But, despite seeing a fellow Storm Trooper die, and then be a bit haunted by seeing villagers massacred, he participates in killing people and there is nothing said when people die around him after that moment. In fact, I find it weird how easily Rey does the same since it seemed like she may have been more than willing to defend herself, but wouldn't take someone out in the process.*Being that Rey was abandoned at an early age, and there is no mention of how she made it to adulthood, I was left with a lot of questions. First being, how did she survive? Much less, being that she didn't seem to be in an affluent area, did she simply learn alien languages to survive, or did she learn before she was abandoned?*I'm still trying to understand how someone can bleed after being shot with a laser. An issue I only bring up for the way Finn is originally identified as a unique storm trooper is by blood wiped onto his helmet after a laser gun fight.*I still remain a bit unsure as to why the Star Wars franchise is so stingy on subtitles for all these aliens and droids. Unless it is because there is a general belief it would take you out of the movie.-On The Fence- *Fully recognizing this is a consistent issue with me, I must say that for a lot of characters I was so unsure what exactly their names were until I looked them up on IMDb. I got Finn and Rey, but many of the other new characters introduced I struggled to grasp their names. Also, when it comes to the lesser characters, like Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), as I felt I was re-watching Star Wars Episode IV, it became so easy to forget who they were since they seemed to no matter in the long run.*Which perhaps leads to the one thing sort of bugging me, why is this so much like episodes IV to VI? I mean, between Kylo Ren, Darth Vader's grandson, idolizing him, and basically walking in his footsteps, to Rey pretty much having the type of start her father Luke had, everything seems like a rehash. Hell, even after failing, what? Three times? Once again a Death Star is made and one central locations leads to the whole thing being destroyed.-Final Thought(s): Worth SeeingIt has been many years since I've watched episodes 1 – 3, and just this past weekend I watched episodes IV – VI in marathon form and, after all that, I can say I fully understand the hype, and this movie makes the best of it. And while, yes, at times the movie does seem predictable, as you realize it is just reinventing familiar stories, at the very least it finds a balance between what made the originals great, comedy, dialog, and action wise, and combines that with the technological advances which made episodes 1 – 3 pretty to look at. Thus creating a film which, to me, helps push the idea that Disney, who owns Star Wars, and Marvel, pretty much have a lock on the best sci-fi movies out there, and aren't just looking to milk these properties, but maintain their status and reaffirm to fans that this isn't exploitation, but a continuation.",9,3,28,18 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The Hunger Games continue and while the supporting characters aren't as interesting as in the first film, Jennifer Lawrence maintains her ability to lead.
","First, let me put it out there I have not read the books but have seen the first movie. With that said, perhaps the sole driving force in seeing this movie was truly Jennifer Lawrence. Though I am familiar with Josh Hutcherson due to his roles in Little Manhattan & Bridge to Terabithia, he just never fully clicked with me once he took on more adult roles. As for other recognizable names: Woody Harrelson returns, as does Elizabeth Banks & Lenny Kravitz, and the familiar faces of Phillip S. Hoffman and Jeffrey Wright join the series. However, though there are many recognizable names, only Jennifer Lawrence stands out.Characters & StoryThose unfamiliar with the series, or even the first film, pretty much get caught up within the first half hour or so. Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) is a young girl who substitutes for her little sister for the Hunger Games, a yearly fight to the death in which 12 segregated districts are forced to have one male and one female be put up as tribute with only one person having a chance to survive. However, upon Katniss coming into the competition, she causes the 74th Hunger Games to be different than the rest. Rather than it be more entertainment for those who live in the capital, where seemingly all the rich live, she becomes a beacon of hope for the 12 districts, all of which are working class.That is where the movie picks up. Katniss has returned home to district 12, a mining district, and is having post-traumatic stress disorder. Between watching a young girl get killed, partially due to her, and killing people herself, she has visions and flashbacks. Luckily, between Gale (played by Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (played by Josh Hutcherson) they try to bring some sense of normalcy to her, and try to protect her. However, due to the ending of the 1st film, Katniss is now seen as a threat to President Snow (played by Donald Sutherland), as after 75 years of the government squashing the last rebellion, a new one is on the rise, and Katniss seems prime to be the leader. So, due to this, he orchestrates a plan to try to have her killed, but naturally the story doesn't make killing the hero easy.PraiseSomething weird about this movie is that somehow, within the first 20 minutes, it had me crying. Likely it was because they showed Rue, and actually gave her district a face. Rue's district, the Black majority one, you can see the hurt and pain in, something you don't get a lot of as they rush through the other districts, and the first 20 minutes set a somber tone. Which, as President Snow starts threatening people and using his peace keepers, begins to turn your somber feelings into anger to the point where you are itching for Katniss to do something about him. And really, Jennifer Lawrence deserves so much praise, not just because she is showing versatility in her varying roles, but because even when she plays a character who mostly looks lifeless in the face, speaks in monotone and, when lively, speaks with the driest of sarcasm, she still can command your attention.The last thing worth praising perhaps are the costume designs, especially the dresses Lenny Kravitz's character Cinna makes, and the handful of fight scenes. Though they aren't as vicious as the first movie, at least to my memory, they still help liven things up as the story begins to slow down.CriticismWhich leads what must be criticized. Be it because I didn't read the book, or because I'm not a big fan of a lot of the actors in this film, I felt most of the supporting cast members didn't have the type of characters that made you feel invested. The reason I say that is, despite so many people's lives being on the line, the only one I felt something for, Rue, was already dead and no one gained that same sort of attachment. Albeit, to a point the character Mags (played by Lynn Cohen) seemed kind of sweet, but you knew her days were numbered. Thus making it so the character Johanna Mason (played by Jena Malone) probably was the only one who really got your attention and kept it. As for the rest of the participants, be they ally or enemy, they seemed very forgettable.And this becomes a glaring issue once the actual Hunger Games begin, for when there aren't battles happening, you are stuck with Peeta, Katniss and these little known people. It makes it so when danger happens, you don't really care about their lives. Which, I'll admit, sounds heartless, but considering all the interesting combatants in the last movie, it just seemed weird that these are the winners and they can't even compete with the nobodies.Overall: Rent on DVDThis series is entertaining, and being that I spoiled the rest of the films by reading the Wikipedia entries, it seems like a lot of interesting things are on the horizon. As for this film though, it is a transition film to me. It sets up for the big finish and throws a few things here and there to keep your attention, but it doesn't improve on the original in my opinion. That is why I think it is more so a rental. Though box office numbers say otherwise, I just felt like I was always waiting for something big and all I got was just enough to say what I paid for wasn't a complete waste. So, just wait until it comes on DVD, the next movie isn't due for another year and there is no real rush.",7,1,15,30 November 2013
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Wick is back and while the movie isn't as lean as the first, with a bit more comedic moments and fights that will make you wince, you learn to deal with the extra fat.
","Trigger Warning(s): Movie Contains Person Slashing Their WristsCharacters & StorylineJust when John thinks he had peace after handling the whole Viggo situation and getting his car back, so enters Santino D'Antonio – The man who provided a way for John to retire in the first place. He calls in a favor which calls for the death of a member of the high council [1], his sister to be specific. John refuses, at first, which leads to Santino destroying John's house. But with this favor being one sealed in blood, the movie isn't simply about John getting revenge on Santino. That is a large part of it, but that can't be done until John kills who Santino asks. Which leads to John becoming more than just recognized internationally, but wanted for dead internationally.Things To Note | Question(s) Left Unanswered[1]. From the way it is explained, while there maybe kingdoms throughout a city, state, and what have you, the high council are the true big dogs. Whether they are the head of the Russian mob, Italian, and etc. However, until a kingdom is taken over it seems they don't necessarily answer to the high council. Well, at least those who control a city's Continental don't seem to have to answer to members of the High Council.[2]. Expect a sequel.HighlightsThey Up The Ante With The Fight & Shooting ScenesWith me just watching the first movie today, then going into the 2nd, you'd think I would get that same jaded feeling you get when you do a Netflix marathon. Well, not in this case. John is as violent as ever and with the inclusion of more knife play, and John killing a few people with a pencil, you will be pleasantly appalled by the violence in this movie.Stronger Characters, Stronger Story, And The Addition Of ComedyWithin the first movie, Keanu Reeves was arguably the only notable actor and John Wick the only notable character. In this movie, however, the King of the New York Continental, Winston, plays a larger role and becomes notable. Also, our villain, Santino, while not the greatest, by any extent, he suffices in becoming someone to hate. However, what really matters here is Ruby Rose as Ares, taking part in one of the few times you'll see a man and woman go toe to toe in an action movie, Common as Cassian, who has these long a drawn out fights with John, and then, to a certain point, there is Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King aka King of the Homeless. Each one leaves the kind of mark where you can tell those involved wanted to go bigger and grander for John Wick's second outing.CriticismJohn Is Given Too Much Slack and His Adversaries are IdiotsThroughout the movie, it seems John is constantly given time to reload and get into a safe position. Plus, despite him getting a slew of injuries thanks to being stabbed, bullet wounds, and getting into some real drawn out fights, after he gets patched up, like some video game character, he bounces back like almost nothing happened.In General, There Is Too Much FatWhile I appreciate the more seasoned actors being brought in, a stronger focus on presenting a story, and how stylized the fight scenes are, at a certain point it just seems like this movie was never going to end. For with John Wick going international and being the 'Boogeyman,' now we have to listen to people talk, see John prepare and go to this place for a bulletproof suit, go to this place for guns, and this other place to get information, and then he finally gets to the location where the action begins. Thus making this movie, similar to the first, feel like a video game. One which, sort of like Mafia III, there isn't much in regards to cutting the fat and taking you straight to the action. No, we have to listen to long ass scenes from people you know are going to die. So you wonder why John is torturing you and himself by letting them go on and on.Overall: Mixed (Home Viewing)While John Wick: Chapter 2 ups the ante when it comes to the action scenes and character development, unfortunately, what seemed like a franchise more about characters putting up or being shut up, loses its most appealing feature – being lean. For with Santino and his sister Gianna allowed to talk more in their scenes combined than anyone probably did in the first movie, alongside Fishburne thinking he is performing on a stage and not in an action movie, their characters act as the fat of the movie. The kind which may add flavor but lessens the look and appeal of the actual meat. Hence the Mixed label. For while the action stays top notch, unfortunately, John Wick: Chapter 2 employs the action genre's worse kind of villains and characters – the ones who don't know how or when to shut the hell up and get to the point.",7,2,21,9 February 2017
Her," A look into the world's future in which computers are more than a programmed assistants to humans, but capable companions, lovers, and friends.
","I have to admit I was originally on the fence when it came to the movie since the concept, while not done too often, just seems odd. A man falling in love with his operating system which isn't some physical form, but nothing but voice and thoughts. However, with me being a sucker for romantic films, I thought it was worth giving it a chance.Characters & StoryFor most of the 2 hours of the film, our focus is on Theodore Twombly (played by Joaquin Phoenix) who is a writer who works for a company which produced hand written notes for people. Theodore's specialty seems to be cards which express love and he has been with some families for years and has produced anniversary cards, amongst other things. But, while Theodore comes off as quite the romantic in his writing, his actual love life is in shambles. His childhood sweetheart Catherine (played by Rooney Mara) he is going through a divorce with, and though he goes on a date with a woman (played by Olivia Wilde), it seems the emotional impact of his divorce is making it hard for him to connect with another woman.Enter Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) who starts off as just an operating system, and evolves into a friend, girlfriend and then things get complicated. Theodore seeks out his friend Amy's (played by Amy Adams) opinion, but while she tries to be supportive, she is working on her own issues as she is in the beginning stages of her own divorce. Thus making it so the overall story feels like an analysis of the need for a connection, and a story which shows the difficulty of falling in love with a person and learning to continue to love the person as you, them, or both of you, evolve with time.PraiseIt is very rare for a two hour movie to not bore me, and yet Her somehow keeps you interested throughout. Be it the fact you just want to know what will happen between Theodore and Samantha, or just want to see more of Spike Jonze's futuristic world, there is just so many questions that you want the answer to, and so much you wish to see and get to vicariously explore. But, what I found strange though is the whole concept of a human and an AI in love. Though you can imagine this becoming a thing in the future, trying to adapt into a mindset where this isn't seen as weird, but sort of acceptable, makes you sort of open your mind a bit as you begin to like Samantha and Theodore as a couple.And what makes this work is the fact that there doesn't seem to be a lot of fat in the cast. Everyone has their place and with that, they all are able to help push the story forward. Adams' character is the best friend who helps give him a safe place to speak on the bewilderment of falling in love with an operating system without judgment; Mara and Wilde's character present the idea, that I'm sure some would have, that perhaps his issue is that he wants control and doesn't wish to really deal with a woman whose emotions aren't programmed to his liking; but yet, at the same time, the way Jonze writes Johansson's character makes it so that while you are likely to have your own prejudices walking in, he makes Samantha complex enough to make you feel conflicted about Theodore and her's relationship.CriticismAnd really, that prejudice is the only thing which really could keep you from getting into the movie. Being that most romance films feature two humans, you expect to see a range of emotions from more than just a person's voice. But, Johannsson does find a way to give a quality performance despite lacking a physical appearance. I will say though, a part of me is left wondering how much of this was merely for the sake of entertainment and how much was it social commentary? After all, the idea of a person falling in love with their computer doesn't sound too foreign, but I do wonder if it is supposed to be a critique of those socially inadequate?Lastly, I must admit the ending was sort of off for me. A part of me fathoms that perhaps Jonze didn't want to adhere too much to the usual trajectory romance films have. But, at the same time, though the ending wasn't ideal, it didn't ruin everything which happened before it.Overall: Worth SeeingI'm not sure how many movies I have seen over my lifetime, but I do feel like this is one of the few movies I may not mind seeing again. Perhaps it is because it tries to stand out as a film which draws me to think it is worth repeated viewing, or because the concept itself makes you think about more than what the film simply presents. Either way, I found it quite enjoyable and definitely think it is worth seeing, at least once. Spike Jonze's script explores an avenue not often taken and rather than it being written to mock, or even have a hint of prejudice, it is sympathetic and tries to understand the foundation of love and how despite how strong a foundation you can build with someone, or even something, things can still collapse.",8,1,2,26 January 2014
