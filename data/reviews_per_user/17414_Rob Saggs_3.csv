The Blair Witch Project," Disappointing!
","Well what can I say? What a disappointment after all that publicity what do you get? A child's scare story and an hour and a quarter of home movie! Unscary, predictable, boring. I would say a waste of time but the amount of money it pulled in at the cinema it can't have been, well it's amazing what hype can do for a bad film!",1,1,3,2 November 2000
X-Men," Excellent
","I've been a fan of the X-Men for a long time now and I was dreading this film as being a terrible film trying to cash in on the 'X-Men' name! However I found this to be possibly the best comic movie cross over so far, Although the story line was not consistent with the comics the characters were captured down to a 'T' from the things they said to the expressions on their faces! I was amazed at how Hugh Jackman captured the compassion and aggression of wolverine and I thoroughly enjoyed this film from start to finish, Brilliant!!!!!",10,0,0,2 November 2000
Gladiator," WOW!
",It may not have the most original story line you'll ever see but lets face it what does these days?  But with great performances from the entire cast and a few unexpected twists this film will keep you glued till the end! Great special effects that blend in so well you can believe that they're really there. Russel Crowe is amazing and gives the performance of a lifetime as Maximus and Ridley Scott's direction just adds to the perfection. A modern day classic and a film I'd recommend to anyone.,Null,0,0,3 November 2000
