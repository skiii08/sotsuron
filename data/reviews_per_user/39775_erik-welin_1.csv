Frost_Nixon," Intelligent film featuring great acting and a fascinating portrayal of one of the most controversial political figures of our time
","Being far too young to have experienced this apparently historic interview live on television, or to know much about the Nixon-years in general, one might conclude that my knowledge of the event itself as well as the character of the notorious Richard Nixon was close to zero before seeing the film. But even though the real Richard Nixon remains outside my grasp, I have much to say about Langella's Nixon, who without any doubt is the center and primary attraction of this remarkable film. The first thing that struck me was how incredibly likable Nixon the person is portrayed in the opening of the film, with his garrulousness and irresistible down-to-earth charms. The same reaction seems to be drawn from Sheen's character when the two first meet at the former president's home early in the film. As the film progresses, however, it becomes fairly clear that Nixon is really running game on Mr Frost as well as the audience, and that his affable demeanor - to a very large extent - is really a performance. So as for the interview, what explicitly starts out as a friendly chit-chat between two new found pals, eventuates in what it implicitly always was: a fierce no holds barred battle for survival between two former public stars. So, once the interview is commenced, the intelligence, fierceness and persuasiveness of Nixon is divulged - something that before had remained hidden behind his tongue-in-cheek charms. Frost and his collaborators are forced to realize that they have underestimated the capacity of the former President and an intense behind-the-scenes battle begins. The psychological game between the two camps, together with the stunning performance from Langella, are indeed the feast of this film. A small glimpse of the Nixon behind the political game-runner is, nonetheless, offered the audience. When an inebriated Nixon calls Mr Frost in the middle of the night, he reveals a resentful and ambitious careerist who is willing to to anything to get back in the political limelight. Still, even at this moment, Langella manages not to demonize Nixon, but succeeds in maintaining the former President's likability - with his charms and capacity to show genuine empathy for his adversary remaining intact. All in all, the film is one of the best features I have seen this year, with its original and intelligent script, and overall superb acting (Rockwell and Platt being the two other stars here). This film is a must see!",8,1,2,12 April 2009
