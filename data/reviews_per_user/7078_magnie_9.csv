The Blair Witch Project," You'll love it or hate it
","There are certain films that, because of their extremes, the viewer will either love or hate.  Like The Exorcist, The Big Lebowski and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Blair Witch falls into this category. I loved it, but I heard a lot of people in the cinema mumbling things like 'that was shit' when it finished.  It was probably over hyped as 'the scariest film ever' which it is not.  In any case, though, no one can deny that you can't help thinking about it constantly the rest of the night after watching it.  What IS making Mike stand up against the wall at the end?",8,0,1,19 March 2000
Snatch," Another Brit gangster movie, but a GOOD ONE this time
","Personally I was getting a bit bored of British gangster movies after the amount of rubbish that followed Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (with the exception of Gangster No 1).  Snatch, though, reminded me why I liked Guy Ritchie's first film so much.  It's all very well having a complex, twisty plot, but Snatch also has killer dialogue and is extremely funny.  It owes as much to a good episode of Minder (classic British TV series) as it does to Goodfellas.  Brilliant cast too. 8/10",8,0,0,23 February 2001
Fargo," A real love-it-or-hate-it film
","Apart from maybe the Blair Witch project, there's no other film that I know of that divides the audience into the camps of love-it or hate-it to such an extreme. Most of the people I know hate this film, but I think it's amazing. It's such an original idea to put have the kidnapping and then put the two scummy bad guys in a quaint, old fashioned small town community.  I love the way the Coen Brothers screw around with genres like that, but not a lot of people seem to get it.  That's their loss though, 9 out of 10.",10,0,0,18 November 2000
American Beauty," Annette Bening's best performance
","This movie could have been made to be really stagey and stifled but instead it's very cinematic, especially during the fantasy scenes involving Mena Suvari and the rose petals.  All the actors are excellent, in particular Annette Bening.  She is often wasted in weak films like The Siege but this is the best performance she's given.",10,0,0,19 March 2000
Being John Malkovich," Excellent but too weird for many people's tastes
","This movie is excellent, there are so many original ideas crammed into it. One review I read compared in to the Coen brothers, I can see their point but there really isn't anything remotely like it.  Unfortunately, like other original films such as Eraserhead or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, it will be too much to handle for anyone who is put off by a lot of weirdness in movies.  That's their loss though, and Being John Malkovich completely deserves its Oscar nominations (why were Malkovich and Cameron Diaz not nominated, though?)",9,0,0,19 March 2000
Mulholland Drive," Oh my god
","Either David Lynch is deliberately messing with everyone's heads or his mind is operating on a completely different level to everyone else's.  Hopefully it's the latter.  This film is totally amazing and is just too much to take in.  You could go completely insane trying to work out what it's about.  I will definitely watch it again, but right now I need to lie down....!",9,5,9,20 September 2002
The Godfather: Part III," Weakest Godfather film (which isn't saying much)
","After the first two, classic instalments of the Godfather saga, and over sixteen years later, there was no way that this would be able to live up to the hype, in the same way as we've seen recently with The Phantom Menace. Sure enough it's not as good and it drags a bit in places but there are still some amazing moments, such as the break-in in Andy Garcia's apartment and the powerful finale. The acting is great particularly from Garcia and Pacino, and Sofia Coppola isn't as bad in this as she's been made out to be. The weakest Godfather film but the best Coppola film since Apocalypse Now.",7,1,2,21 April 2000
A Beautiful Mind," I wanted to like it but...
","Contains SPOILERS
I wanted to like this film, I though Crowe gave a good performance, but I just thought the whole 'is it real or is it all in his mind' thing was a bit patronising and very manipulative, especially because it was based on a true story.  I suppose it could have been worse, but it just left a bad taste, also, it's all been done before in Fight Club (and Vanilla Sky, Mulholland Drive, etc etc)",6,1,2,21 October 2002
Carrie," Greatest movie shock scene ever
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSWho cares if De Palma was stealing Hitchcock's style if he came up with something as powerful as Carrie.  The final scene is probably the greatest shock scene (or if you must 'jumpy bit') in movie history, even the tiger scene in Apocalypse Now.  Anyone who didn't jump out of their seat while watching that scene was either drunk, dead or lying.  It's been imitated countless times, but Carrie cannot be bettered.",10,0,0,21 April 2000
