10 Cloverfield Lane," Conned into watching a horror movie with an extreme feminist bent vs sci-fi thriller
","Was it suspenseful? Yes. Was John Goodman's performance convincing? Absolutely. Was it the alien/monster thriller I was expecting? No. I should have known better from a movie produced by JJ Abrams, but I went and saw the movie anyway, hoping for an entertaining post apocalyptic thriller. Instead I got bamboozled into watching an extremely feminist movie portraying all males as abusers of women, with one exception, Emmet, who was a milk toast man-child. The female protagonist had an abusive boyfriend she flees from, a history with an abusive father, and in the course of the movie, relates a story about an abusive father that roughly treats and hits his little daughter in Home Depot. Her captor, male of course, is a homicidal maniac. Even Santa Claus, when they are playing a board game, is portrayed as a scary male figurehead 'always watching' and 'knows what you are up to.' Why do movies like these with a strong female lead have to show men in such an unflattering light and disenfranchise half their audience? Her co-captor Emmett can't stand up to Howard, played by John Goodman, even though he is a fat old man. The female protagonist on the other hand is portrayed as a superhero, with an throwing arm so accurate and powerful it belongs in the major leagues. 95% of the movie takes place in the basement, with much more of a horror film feel than a sci-fi thriller. Unlike other critics, I thoroughly enjoyed the last few minutes of the film where the protagonist finally escapes the bunker and her tormentor, only to do battle with alien forces. The sci-fi finally kicks in, I just wish most of the movie was dealing with that antagonist vs John Goodman's character.",1,6,15,25 March 2016
