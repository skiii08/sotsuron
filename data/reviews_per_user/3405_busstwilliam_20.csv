Mission: Impossible III," underrated
",Phillip seymour hoffman is the best villain in this series too.,7,2,2,17 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's ok
","Was definitely a lot better when I was younger but I've always appreciated that Lucas was trying to do something different or something we didn't expect. The film is boring at times during the senate meetings but ewan mcgregor is likeable as obi wan and he is all throughout the prequels , Darth Maul is cool , i like the podrace. The film is ok there is some entertaining scenes especially towards the end.",6,0,5,20 April 2020
Skyfall," Hmm
","Gonna be honest , i didn't like this one when i first saw it (i think i had a majot hangover after the abysmal quantum of solace) and i've come to like this film even more since it came out tbh.
It's unique.
Silva is a great villain too.
Great film...",7,0,3,21 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Decent
","Love this film apart from boba fett's death ( i think they underestimated how popular boba fett was) overall though i absolutely love this film and the trilogy.
The ending is so great so great.",9,0,2,21 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," rise of disney!
","All i'm gonna say is thanks disney , you ruined my childhood.",1,21,35,21 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Interesting...
","The fact that the dialogue (especially the romantic stuff) is cringeworthy and awkward kinda makes sense for Anakin's character actually because he had never been in a relationship before so I can kind of understand why he's like this. I actually find this film more entertaining than the phantom menace because there is less senate meetings and more action and jedi aren't just sitting around in rooms this time because thousands of jedi go to help anakin and obi wan on geonosis. The most disappointing thing for me in this film is that there isn't really a story , someone is trying to asassinate padme and we eventually find out who but i feel like episode 2 should've just been the clone wars really and getting to know their characters more because they're a lot different to the stormtroopers eventhough they look similiar. Not gonna lie though to this day i do find some of the film entertaining.
The sub plot about sifo dyas wasn't explored at all really until the clone wars show which was interesting. Oh and christopher lee is great , i like him in anything he's in really , kinda like liam neeson..",6,0,2,20 April 2020
The Bourne Ultimatum," Flawless
","One of the best trilogies out there , this is the best of the three but they're all amazing.",10,0,2,21 April 2020
The Bourne Identity," Decent spy thriller
","Matt damon is really good in this film
The pacing is great , the characters(even the smaller ones) are great!",9,0,2,21 April 2020
Quantum of Solace," Embarassing sequel to the best bond film in my opinion
","Terrible action
God awful editing
Terrible villains
Awful plot (if there even is one)
Nothing to like here apart from Daniel Craig who is still good in this film..",3,2,4,21 April 2020
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," good
",Villain is probably the weakest one of the series but everything else is good,8,0,0,28 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," 0 stars
","This film made me feel betrayed , when i left the cinema when it first came out i was in shock and disbelief at what i had seen. I've made so many rants about this film already so i'm not going to bother wasting my time ranting again but all i'm gonna say is why?
Would rather watch Attack of the clones and the phantom menace because those films while disappointing , actually have some decent scenes and don't offend me like this film does.",1,16,22,21 April 2020
Taken," Excellent film.
","Liam Neeson had been in action before this but wow he is intimadatingly good here , he rocks!",8,0,3,21 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Wow
",I just wrote out a really long review and then i lost it so i'll just leave my rating here.,9,1,4,20 April 2020
Taken 2," Mediocre

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Flawless
","Absolutely flawless , there is nothing i don't like about this film. Nothing more to say.",10,0,2,21 April 2020
Spectre," Disappointing but not bad
","This was gonna be the finale to the craig era and apparently blofeld is behind all this...
Didn't believe it for a second.
I mean he never talks seriously , he's always joking in every scene. This should've been the film that quantum of solace should have been, a conclusion to vespers story and yes there is parts where bond finds stuff about vesper but he never talks about it.
And can i just say i have never seen such a boring car chase in any film ever that i've seen..",6,0,5,21 April 2020
The Bourne Supremacy," Nice
",Surprisingly enjoy this one more than the first eventhough i love the first.,8,0,1,21 April 2020
