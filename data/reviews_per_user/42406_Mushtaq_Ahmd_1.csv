Vertigo," Bad
",This was my first Alfred Hitchcock movie. And not a good experience. Whirlpool of terror???? I have to redefine my definition of whirlpool and/or terror. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I had a hard time completing this movie. I am shocked to see this movie in the same list of top 250 where movies like Godfather. See it to believe me.,Null,1,6,3 November 2002
