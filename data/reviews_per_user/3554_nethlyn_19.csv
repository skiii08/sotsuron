Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Longer and less violent than Vol 1, makes good bookend.
","That's right- a QT movie with less violence in it than the last one. Some sections of the UK media have attacked the morality in the film, but that a/morality becomes much more complex when Uma Thurman's character finally meets Bill again (the name of the film is Kill Bill, that wasn't a spoiler)- that's when the sole motivation of bloody revenge suddenly gets much, much more complicated.I was shocked to see brief scenes of TENDERNESS in a Tarantino film as well as full exposition and fleshing out of the characters. It's great that he's matured but then yanks us back to his usual territory which his fans demand- fast visceral and violent action, with dialogue to match in not just English. He might love all those old classic martial arts films but isn't afraid to add a dash of subtle parody to the proceedings - all the while never losing sight of Yuen Wo-Ping's talented fight arrangements and team.
I'm posting this on the night of the release in the UK, which means I can't spoil anything- that makes it hard to talk about. Let's just say I cleared my schedule, crashed early, got up early, took the day off and went to the first showing at my childhood home town's local- 'cause it was the new TARANTINO movie, just like I'd want to see the newest Spielberg or Cameron flick. Just watch it and make up your own mind- and  stay to the end of the credits for a preview of the first DVD Extra you'll see in six months.",Null,0,1,23 April 2004
Iron Man 3," This is 'Lethal Iron' With Tony Stark As Riggs and Rhodey as Murtagh
","Shane Black wrote the script - the dialogue is excellent. The budget was something north of $150-200million - it's on the screen, and 90% of the 3D works well with subtlety and not just in your face negative parallax.So what's the problem? It's not about Iron Man anymore and Disney thought we wanted to watch two hours of 'ah heck my suit's not working again' and turn these characters into a standard wisecracking action duo, or if they actually get to wear a suit of armour then they're R2-D2 and that suit will get smashed to bits because this is a hilarious running joke from the Avengers onwards. It got old after two hours in the Avengers but nope, here it is all over again.The treatment of the villain might have been smart but more time should have been given over to Guy Pearce's excellent performance than just a simple flashback and cut to the present day. Then it would've been more believable than having his plans nearly succeed all over one single Christmas period, he's criminally underused and so are his non-super-powered henchmen.The ending is also complete BS, trying to give some kind of patriotic flag wave about counter-terrorism and to some extent takes another leaf from Nolan's Batman films with regard to Stark.All that Man of Steel has to do is to be about Superman without the relationship sub-plots getting in the way of the action and that will be the better film this summer out of the two. Anyone that disliked Iron Man 2, go back and watch that again because this is worse.",7,3,6,26 April 2013
Dawn of the Dead," Zombies are once again your metaphor for whatever, and in this case, it's more like Aliens than Romero's original - in a good way.
","*****SLIGHT SPOILERS***** Watched both the cinema cut and now have the Director's version on DVD, this film probably has 1000 comments after 18 months but having watched it three times since buying the DVD one thing struck me...for all its homages to the original Dawn of the Dead with the cameos etc, this movie actually owes much more to Aliens (1986) in its speed, execution, and the fact there's a bigger group of people, not to mention of course the running Zombies of 28 Days Later (2003), itself a heavy 'borrowing' of Day of The Dead (1985), but whose $45million US gross allowed this remake to exist.It's not a question of thinking the original or the remake is the superior version...Romero's Dawn of the Dead 1978 is the 'Alien' of the two films, slower, more intelligent, more thought-provoking and with an attempt to actually show you a six-month stretch locked in a shopping mall with a 40-minute second act which modern filmmakers just don't do anymore. Snyder's Dawn of The Dead 2004 is Aliens, (or Platoon in a shopping mall) an action film with Zombies in it but the Zombies are a metaphor for whatever you want and not what Romero told you as with the 70s film.The 'rules' have been set up, but in comes a director who focuses on action and gives a bigger group of people better aim and the hope of a better chance (though that also means a larger group of people to bite the dust). In spite of the mall scenes dominating the second Act as with the original, you get a greater sense of scale with the new film although no mention of the internet except in one of the DVD Extras. One of the rules of the original is also dropped. I prefer the Dawn of the Dead novel to the older film, which only takes me 2 hours to read.As for the director's cut...some scenes I plain couldn't remember but on having them pointed out, I was glad they were gone when I watched the film in the cinema - I don't care how they got into the mall, the film language did that for me with just two good shots cut together, rather than the 'where's the door' nonsense. Likewise with the 'littlest Zombie' scene (fans know which one I'm talking about) - again, in the cinema, we saw as much as we needed to know and the faster cutaway was a lot better to end it.***SPOILER***I don't know if it's classed as a blooper when one character at a crucial moment, cannot open a door but then when it's time for him to check out, the zombies have absolutely no trouble - that's the one fault I could find with the film and I have had to watch it four times to find that, so I will put that down to nitpicking. Besides, Universal have my money now! The ending? Speculative and the whole (surviving) cast were signed to the sequel, as their careers don't seem to have been damaged in the same way as the 1970s cast, there wouldn't be anything wrong with the sequel to this remake coming around again - even if ***SPOILER AGAIN*** the end had shades of Deep Rising to it, mixed with The Blair Witch Project in the use of DV. It's clever that you're seeing a different side of a character just through clips - or maybe just reconfirming his reputation. One of the DVD Extras continues the use of the DV Camera technique and it works extremely well.As a means of passing time while waiting for Land of The Dead which doesn't hit UK screens until the 23rd September, the Dawn Of The Dead remake is a great action movie with zombies in it, and made by a fan for open-minded fans of Romero's films and a new generation which doesn't put Romero's trilogy on a pedestal and wants a faster film. You could watch either version according to your mood. It's certainly not the disaster some of the posters here have made out to be, the only problem is, can you rent the cinema cut where you are? I've only found the director's one in the shops. Wait for the second UK edition and you'll probably be able to buy both.",9,2,3,9 September 2005
Shaun of the Dead," 3.5 stars rather than XLent- still see it
","The BBC has shown the original Night and Dawn of The Dead over the weeks since Dawn's remake was released at the end of March 04, so any fans can compare all four films if they've seen them (and in my case, read the 1978 Dawn of The Dead novel). In that context, coming at the end of three 'serious' Zombie flicks in a fortnight, 'Shaun' is just what I needed but the producers obviously aimed for a release date around that of Dawn's remake. The characters are developed far enough for you to miss them if they bite the dust and even if they conflict with Shaun & co, which didn't happen with Romero's series as he preferred the 'people not knowing each other thrown together' angle with 'Night' and 'Day' of the Dead (In 'Night' nobody would have had a publicly acknowledged black friend in late 60s Deep Southern US), and in original 'Dawn' it's two pairs of characters who know each other through work.I don't do spoilers but I will say that the running theme from Romero's flicks of what happens when the people close to you become victims, is also explored in this film with much more immediate honesty and doesn't let the viewer laugh off a pessimistic moment. In fact once they reach somewhere they think they're safe, the laughs are put on hold for the proper horror to really get a grip. It's an excellent mix of horror and comedy and certainly the most unique way I've seen of making romcom fodder interesting to a male audience (as in 99% of the usual mush, they always end up together with a lot less work). Zombie fans need to listen out for the music at the start and on the credits, but also the dialogue and check out the name of Shaun's workplace.I enjoyed it but will probably buy the DVD rather than watch it again on the big screen. We'll have to see if going for the laughs allows it to beat 28 Days' $45million gross in America. Horror fans have had to put up with much worse enforced attempts at comedy with gore (witness the Freddy series). It's not laugh out loud funny all the way through but that wasn't the intention. It's well worth watching in my opinion.The only criticism I couldn't refute was the ripping-off of Sam Raimi's chained-together camera zoom effects. However people not into films won't care about that. See it.",Null,0,1,13 April 2004
Spider-Man 2," Swings past Shrek 2 as best family summer film of 2004.
","Two years ago, Sam Raimi got the original Spider-Man mostly right by not boring longstanding fans with the setting up and updating of the hero for the 21st century. Its World Trade Centre trailer also placed it in cinema history for a different reason. This year, the same cast is back in a film which is more a straightforward continuation than a sequel although a character makes reference to time gone by, and Peter Parker's at University instead of school, the director takes care to keep his movie-New York look similar to the original. The villain this time is Doctor Octopus, who gets his own setup and by choosing Alfred Molina, Raimi goes a cut above the usual Brit making the American movie star look good. It also differs from the first film in that we see the scientist as a normal if slightly misguided person, before he goes mad. Once he's mad though, the action gloves come off and CGI Spider-Man's more refined and moves like a human being when 100% digitised, more so than in the first.
While the action's top notch, the human drama of Parker's relationships form the other hour of the film and there's a point of no return where it feels like everything's lost, and of course it takes the rest of the flick for them to reach a resolution. Those fractured relationships elevate the film to another almost better-than-the-original superhero sequel, Superman II, and keeps you interested. The ending does everything it needs to including the setup for the next film. It's the only Hollywood film released this year which I want to see twice. In fact I'm going back to do just that, tomorrow. See it. Only AVP2 might be a rival for the older summer audience, as this is a PG, take the whole family to watch it, don't wait for rental.",Null,0,0,15 July 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Mid-90s throwback, great action (but you'll have watched that in the trailers) and after that a set of slightly 2D human reactions and messages regarding the environment- Great effects, only a so-so film
","Watched this on UK Preview today, a decent half of it's in the trailer but luckily there's some stuff left to watch afterwards. The money's on the screen along with what little script the actors have to work with.A disaster movie takes us back to the mid-90s though, it's better than Daylight, Deep Impact, Armageddon (easily), though its characters can be accused of lacking dimension like those in Twister. Volcano doesn't even register on the radar, but Dante's Peak had better acting and just the one disaster in a localized area to deal with.Pretty much the best shot in the movie is when the very first proper US disaster scenes finish. The film's very sanitized, there's little death on camera (no time to show it, never mind the certificate) and there's no easy way out for America as shown by the other characters Dennis Quaid is in contact with. There's a minimum of sentiment throughout the film, any other messages are more subtle (like the cute blasted dog has to live). It also seems movies involving NY getting wiped out are now permissible again post-September 11. Showing so few deaths on camera restricted the sentimentality to the lead adult characters and even then, it was muted. As so many characters were UNselfish though, you could have accused the film of being slightly unrealistic but the human reactions to a disaster are understandably random.What you'll either find either more suspenseful or just boring is the human struggle after the great CGI destruction, and then you get some gallows humour and irony and the rest of it's about one quest. Again, the money's on the screen. That's about it though. It was good enough for an empty blockbuster, not as dead-brained as Van Helsing but not as funny either, and a different style of action to Troy. In short, The Day After Tomorrow's a bit of a throwback and a DVD Chapter-stop/Widescreen TV show-off flick. It does have an excellent, simple soundtrack score though.Whilst I enjoyed it, if you have a widescreen TV you could rent it and enjoy it just as much if you've been unfortunate enough to see the trailer(s) where you were stupidly shown far too many of the money shots. It's not crap- just overexposed by its distributor.",Null,0,0,27 May 2004
Resident Evil: Extinction," I should've waited for DVD - and Romero needs a good lawyer to sue for royalties
","Extinction was leaving British cinemas from this weekend so I thought, catch at least one of the Resident Evil films on the big screen for once. Wrong choice, I only watched Apocalypse on DVD the day before I caught this film and the small screen's the best place for them.On the big screen my problem with RE Extinction was the fact that despite being based on a novel where some scenes could have been brought to life, standard scary movie clichés abound - Oded Fehr's recurring character is an ex-SWAT type, but after battling these creatures twice before these idiots *still* split up to search empty buildings instead of covering each other? If they've been driving through the desert, wouldn't they have needed to weather-proof the vehicles as best they can for a quick getaway, if they've 'lost people before'? Guess what happens next... then there are other scenes where people die for no good reason because it's a horror film and common sense has to be discarded to move the film on and hit the 95-minute mark (eg the Day of the Dead 'Bub training' scene).The script is a travelogue, moving Alice on her own and this Land of the Dead-style convoy from A to B to C and actually, moves from ripping off early Romero like the first two films did, to Dawn of the Dead 2004, Day of the Dead and 28 Days/Weeks Later. There are visual steals from Planet of The Apes and Hitchcock's The Birds, the former being a cruelly wasted visual homage rather than amping up the scale of the action like it could have done - though it's stylishly done, it's hard to care about some characters that die if you were only introduced to them just under an hour earlier. Parts of Extinction deliberately take you back to the very first film, but once the slam-bang finale is over with, it sets you up for a big finish in part 4.One problem that carries on from Apocalypse to Extinction is that the characters fight like they're in a video game which just doesn't work on film. Once again, Oded Fehr's character should know best but no, everybody stands around waiting for their ammo to run out before they start retreating, when they're up against the '28 Days Later' Zombies including trying to shoot them anywhere else but in the head without using big knives instead. That leads to the other millennial gender politics of film occurring since the convoy is decimated by the time they get to the life-saving transport - but in another magic edit, we don't get to see the zombies flood the outer compound. (It would have been more believable that they couldn't break down the fences had they been electrified as in Land of the Dead, probably a budgetary issue).Ultimately the natural home for these flicks, while Paul Anderson's writing the script anyway, is on DVD. Direction is as well executed as you'd expect from the director of Highlander but he's only got the script he's been given. Hopefully no.4, if it's the last one, will be allowed maybe 10-15 minutes more if we're talking about a Terminator-styled bringing it back to the start in order to finish the film franchise. It's divided critics and fans alike but I will give it another viewing on DVD next year where I'll probably enjoy it a lot more.",6,1,2,4 November 2007
The Matrix Revolutions," Love or hate Reloaded, this completes the sequel and the series- so see it
","Thank Christ I was too busy to look at anything about the film before I was sat there watching it, given reports of negative reviews (I never listen to critics anymore, I can make up my own mind and everyone's a critic with the Internet now!) It does come across as the other half from Reloaded, the fight scenes invoking elements and memories of all three parts of the trilogy while adding their own strand at the same time.Suffice to say that there are only two really ugly cliched moments that stand out and took me out of the film and luckily they were followed by action scenes to quickly get me back. Unlike LXG and Star Wars Clones, the fight scene that looks like a computer game in Revolutions is still enjoyable to watch, and CGI does not cheat you out of seeing great close-up action and death. If they got this scene right as a videogame then it would be the best sci-fi co-op first person action title since Serious Sam 1 and 2. Sadly you'll have to watch the film to get my meaning, no spoilers as promised!Mary Alice, replacing the late Gloria Foster as The Oracle was spookily accurate with the voice- unless it was the original actress dubbed onto hers. Good touch and good acting however they did it.This is the 'Return Of The Jedi' kind of sequel- but with sentimentality taking the place of the Ewoks. Then again if your world was in danger of ending, lots of trite human emotions are probably what you'd come out with. It's mostly tighter, not strolling around in love with its own intellectual self-satisfaction as much as Reloaded.The final fight has shades of Kill Bill in its styling, which I'm sure is accidental, or a result of QT's devotion to Hong Kong/Asian action cinema.- or just Yuen Wo Ping's general genius. Nice move anyway. And requiring the audience to use their imagination at the end...(or just remember one scene from Reloaded which may explain it)- great way to just leave people hanging.Look you've seen the other two, this is the biggest thing out before Return Of The King. Just see it, IMO it defies commonsense not to round off the series. I think it's great, and will probably catch it a couple more times on my UGC Subscription Card because that would make it free to me after the second viewing (in the UK). Even if you hate it, these are big-screen movies, so see them where you'll enjoy them best. It was also great to be watching a heavily promoted Hollywood film at the same time as America for a change. Hopefully this trend will continue as well!",Null,0,0,5 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Diet Terminator 2
","...that's the only fault with the movie. There is a stack of rewatchable action but far too much of Arnie from the future knowing everything and so speaking the plot, and cue stupefied reactions from Danes and Stahl. Done last film, to excess, and so despite the top-notch action, this movie feels thin and Avid-edited to the bare bones.This is The Machines Strike Back and does the workmanlike setup job well- and the ending's very ballsy for a summer film. Then again none of the Terminator movies ended particularly happily.Please C2/Intermedia, get T4 going within the next five years and stop cheating the audience- give us the future war (and not just in dreams or flashbacks/flashforwards) which will round off the series nicely- even split it into two. Whatever happens, we can't be waiting another decade for it when the technology for the effects is here now. T4 cannot be yet another retread of T2, please.",Null,0,0,1 August 2003
Van Helsing," Cut and paste action flick -rent
","Saw this on UK preview today, and in a more forgiving mood you could call this a brain-off action flick.Even so that was no excuse for copying and pasting from: The Mummy (hey look the slave henchman's been typecast!), Aliens, a one-scene homage to Predator, Sleepy Hollow, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (along with its rubbish CGI from one of 8 different effects houses), Underworld, Blade, the Bond films, Evil Dead III, Raiders of The Lost Ark and Gremlins 2.If you're in a bad mood, it's just terrible. Mind you I didn't like LXG either, so if you also hated that, rent this- the effects won't look so naff on a television.Why? Scene-chewing exposition and a lame script that's travelog not dialogue, though the actors do their best and the chief villain of course has the best lines and provides the most fun. The whole project seems to have overwhelmed Stephen Sommers and more so, his editor. It's only partly redeemed by an ending which doesn't cop out Hollywood style and terrific, ironically OTT soundtrack from Alan Silvestri.So, the first 2004 summer season flick, and unlike five years ago, it's not an unexpected surprise hit. It's not fair to keep knocking Sommers over the head with the Mummy movies, but even Deep Rising was better.",Null,0,1,6 May 2004
Alien vs. Predator," I wanted to like it...I lost!
","Firstly what's PG-13 to America is 15 here in the UK- and considering almost every other Alien/Predator related flick has been an 18, the rot set in right there. Considering there's plenty of yellow and green blood flying around all over the place, it's a mystery why the fights have been 'MTV'd' to death since there's no human blood going on - hardly a spoiler when you look at the certificate.If Anderson had been honest and told us the great historical setup he hyped on the official site was going to be 30 seconds in the finished product, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. Setting this in Antartica brings back fleeting shades of John Carpenter's The Thing and reminds you that there's no attempt to bother scaring anyone, once the characters have been moved to where the action will start. The script is just travelog and smacks of Jurassic Park as Colin Salmon and Lance Henriksen do the Jurassic Park fairy Godfather routine, bribing the cast to go on the voyage. Sanaa Lathan and Lance Henriksen make more of the dire script through their acting ability, but Ewen Bremner's the comic relief and everyone else, forgettable. I would say rent it and wait for director's cut(s) on DVD, then at least you can see a complete mess for adults in the comfort of your own home, rather than this edited one for kids and teens. Disappointment. Anderson is no David Fincher but the same thing has happened with him v the studios, and he lost. When we see what was intended on the small screen, that's when we can blame Anderson rather than the producers who were giving orders to the editors.If there's a sequel, just closely adapt the comics, that's why they're classics. It's getting to desperate times in Hollywood when the PC game from five years ago gave better entertainment, was a bigger hit and cost a hell of a lot less to make than the film you just went out to watch.",Null,0,0,21 October 2004
2012," Too little film for too great a cost - but it will be the 2nd best Blu Ray test disc to date after Avatar...
","In fact I'm wondering if the Blu Ray will end up gold-plated for the amount of money thrown at the screen. I gave it half-marks because you can at least see where that cash went just by watching it.The main spoiler, is that there is no plot to spoil. The upside is you get 40 minutes of general setup but only for 4-6 characters, then it's a destruction-fuelled roller-coaster ride to the end. The problem is, we've had September 11th for real, the telephoning and saying goodbye to loved ones and total lack of hope happened for real eight years back so it's overtly cynical to manipulate the audience that way - 2012's emotional blackmail makes Spielberg's trademark sentimentality look ice cold.Also I can see the general subtext here, the most featured deaths along the way happen to people who've had affairs or let down their family in some way without any attempt to fix it, though there is the standard Hollywood 'Redemption by Act III' for one unpleasant character in the party of survivors. The pace of the destruction lets you forget that you're getting variations on the same death scenes, but the whole end feels tacked on and boring.So if you have Blu-Ray player and a flat TV of 37inches and above...you could probably pass on 2012 bar maybe a rental.",5,0,1,6 December 2009
Shrek the Third," One of three below-par summer sequels in 2007
","It's a bad start when I went out to see Shrek The Third partly because I knew it would be short. Despite this, there were still a couple of moments where I was bored, but they had been left in to make 90+ minutes. STT is more of a proper kids' film in the style it wants to parody (ie, Disney) but that means that it loses the anarchic touches of the first two films. Compared to Spider Man 3 and Pirates 3 though, it drops the least amount of quality for being the third. It parodies and rips shots from Rosemary's Baby, Jurassic Park, The first Lord of the Rings Movie and, depending on how you like your trees, The Evil Dead OR the second Lord of The Rings film. This time, the homages couldn't save it, and had I not been waiting to watch Live Free or Die Hard, I wouldn't have killed time to watch it.There's going to be the Solo Puss movie eventually and maybe that spin-off will help because this was just a cash-in.",4,0,1,1 November 2007
Shrek 2," See it - if only because pt.3 could be one too far
","Watched it on UK release day, first performance and my first film after recovering from illness so it had to be good.The original Shrek was the saviour of a really dismal summer (2001) with only Swordfish giving better entertainment and that was adults only. The sequel treads the careful line of jokes pitched above the heads of the moppets and sight gags for the kiddies and so we have a film which everyone can enjoy in spite of being a sequel.Let's face it, these are fairy tales getting a modern spin, so I just suspended my disbelief and enjoyed it. It wasn't Citizen Kane nor should you expect that, just a great animated comedy chasing that new Oscar.The movies referenced this time round are the Spider-Man kiss, Ghostbusters and one song quite knowingly reminds you of Beauty and The Beast- then again we are in fairytale country. It's pleasantly familiar and keeps you chuckling rather than the shockingly original laugh-out-loud first film. In the end though it manages a message that's actually very Disney - without banging you over the head with it and a lot less sentimentality.The voice actors perform the script well,there's less of an acting performance to judge since it's animated, but the scriptwriters weren't afraid to have pauses while you admire the camera-work as if it were a live-action film in places. The animators are keen to remind you of the progression in technology with some improved slo-mo. If you hated the first film? I doubt there's much to make you change your mind here but for the open minded or those who loved the first, Shrek 2's Generally a laugh and well worth watching and at 90 minutes easy on your concentration - I liked it, but like Austin Powers, will part 3 endanger the franchise? Back in two years to find out according to IMDb.",Null,0,0,2 July 2004
The Dark Knight Rises," A brilliant end to Nolan's trilogy - if not better than The Dark Knight, tarnished by the shooting
","My spoiler is, just don't search online for Batman #500 from the old print run which is where Dark Knight Rises takes a big chunk of its story, together with Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns graphic novel for the rest of the general look and action from the film. The rest rolls right along from The Dark Knight movie albeit with the time jump.It doesn't beat The Dark Knight and how could it, Tom Hardy's Bane is as good a performance as you could expect from behind a mask that was never taken off, which wasn't an issue with the other main villains from previous films. For 2hr 45mins it didn't drag and get boring - on the first viewing anyway. The money and locations are on the screen, the action builds up to a series of skirmishes if not a completely epic battle since the best of the fireworks are saved until last. The aftermath is Nolan's customary nod to the audience.I watched it at a normal screen but anyone viewing on IMAX wouldn't be disappointed, there are definitely more shots that you can see could be framed for the ultra-massive screens than the handful that were inserted into The Dark Knight.I'd give it one more viewing for the fact it's the last one, but after that, for a film that's nearly three hours I'd await the Blu-Ray. Also cannot believe that someone went to a cinema to kill people watching a movie, which will also be (unfairly) reflected onto the film. RIP those who died, condolences to those affected.",8,1,5,20 July 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," Fox takes an older hero and gives it that 24 spin, result - a sequel up there with Bourne
","I watched the UK preview of Live Free or Die Hard/Die Hard 4.0 on 4 July to get ahead of the crowds and I really enjoyed its old-school, slam-bang action. Unlike any of the other long-in-tooth sequels this summer (Shrek/Spider-Man/Pirates), Die Hard 4's editing was good enough that I wasn't bored and the movie didn't drag in spite of its length. It's the best translation of 24's atmosphere to film since MI-III last year but with a lead character you can care about and root for - Willis manages to sympathise with his/the character's age and burnout and the need for the sidekick to be computer-literate for him to stand a chance. It's a less claustrophobic and contained action film than the first two DH movies which, by definition, couldn't go anywhere but the one location. Also, the A-plot could happen, further linking in with 24 from the same firm. I liked how they injected a kind of embittered, older,even meaner Jack Bauer into John McClane's character, the whole chaos-causing plot reminded me of 24 before it snapped back into Die Hard with the set-piece action that basically ramps up from five minutes in and doesn't stop until the end. Unlike Die Hard with a Vengeance it's not a completely abrupt full stop that implies almost going bust on the budget. The two female characters aren't window dressing and the first of the two chase scenes involving differently matched vehicles is the best stunt work I've seen since Tomorrow Never Dies (but it will have been spoilt by any trailer).12 years between the third and fourth movies have only resulted in quality. It's fast, funny with a good cameo, the snappy one-liners you expect which hit more often than they miss and I will see it again. It was the best action I'd watched in summer 2007 before The Bourne Ultimatum arrived in the UK five weeks later. Can't wait to buy this on DVD.My Sole criticism? Critics may whine because it's unashamedly aimed at men in spite of those two strong female roles. After 12 years and three other films you know whether you like Die Hard or not, but if you preferred 24, then still give Live Free or Die Hard a try, whether it's the cinematic or rumoured unrated cut.",8,0,1,1 November 2007
X2: X-Men United," A stack of action, with an end to leave 'em talking
","The first X-Men had to do the setting up for people who hadn't read the comics, so while (the cinema cut) was good, I still got slightly bored. Freed from that necessity in the sequel, they just got on with the action. Really enjoyed it, and the repetition of showing more mutants eg Colossus, who'll hopefully get a proper look-in in the next film as Iceman has, was a good touch. I don't know how they pick them exactly, given the number of X-Men there must have been in the comics in 30 years!It felt transitional, more than one character was developed further and the best touch was, super powers didn't solve everything, and one way the ending *could* have happened, and therefore the world would have been saved in Superman style, didn't. (No spoilers means you'll just have to watch it to see what I mean). Again, good. When X3 arrives, hopefully there'll be a few more mutant villains as the human mutant haters have been done twice now. There's plenty of Star-Trek style musing on teen sex, racism, sexuality, if you choose to read that into it, otherwise you can leave issues at home and enjoy the first summer blockbuster of 2003- and at least it's good.",Null,0,0,2 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," After all is said and done
","Some people overlook flaws if they're too passionate, and other killjoys just want to slag off anything that's remotely popular and which a large number of people can enjoy. Both groups have siezed upon Return Of The King in equal numbers.Personally I watched the film twice and although the running time didn't stop it flying by, you do get to spot some of the shakier effects even without consciously looking for them, so I'm glad I never made it back a third time, choosing to buy The Two Towers on DVD instead. It doesn't detract from the overall spectacle and the great music throughout. If you are going to buy the UK DVD at the start of May 04, you'll see what you were missing. It's tempting to not buy ROTK until I have a much bigger widescreen TV, and keep my memories of the cinema showings.The Ensemble cast were well established by 2002 when they started filming, though it's perfectly fair that the film didn't win any individual acting awards- it got enough in the other categories. Howard Shore deserved his Oscar this time, though- Gandalf's Death is the only piece of the score I remember from either of the other two films, but Return of the King achieves that rare 20th century achievement of helping to tell the story with the music and so the score is as good as the film, so its soundtrack wasn't 'swept up' and given a freebie as sometimes happens.Just like I wrote about Matrix Revolutions, ROTK rounds off the series so just catch it. If you didn't watch it at the cinema, your loss and better seats for everyone else. If the great reviews, the five-month cinema run, the big gross and the Oscars haven't convinced you to watch it, nothing will. If you've no axe to grind with making comparisons to the books, then see this modern classic as soon as possible if you haven't already.",Null,0,1,14 April 2004
V for Vendetta," Never read the graphic novels and loved this film
","I watched this after seeing The Hills Have Eyes Remake, but V delivered a very different type of blow to the brain! I have never read the original graphic novel so I was watching it purely to see how well the Wachowskis could move on after The Matrix. The answer? Considering the Matrix was seven years ago this was great. I don't know why fans of the graphic novel are so hacked off, if a lot more people like me will now go and buy the book. IF it's true that V takes off his mask in the comic, I'm glad they made that change in the film so that we never see him. It boosts Hugo Weaving's performance as does the lesser amount of action in this film vs The Matrix movies - then again this is set in a fictionalised version of a real place, where even in spite of the bombings and shooting of 2005, it would've been an unrealistic distraction to have as much action as an American-set film.So good movie and a highly likely DVD Buy as well as the graphic novel itself. It's nice to know films designed to make you think don't stop getting released once the Oscars are finished. Predictably the messengers are getting shot in real life but who cares, the debate's not going to stop in modern times.",9,2,4,27 March 2006
