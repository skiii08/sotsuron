Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great - for the most part
",I loved the movie.  I hated Jar Jar. I loved Darth Maul.  I hated his small role. I loved the pod races.  I hated the announcers. I loved seeing it on the first day.  I hated the lines.The loves far outweigh the hates.  It's a fine movie and I can't wait to see it again.,9,0,0,21 May 1999
