Raiders of the Lost Ark," Excellent
","This film really is excellent. Definitely the best adventure film out there. It is heart warming, classic hero vs villain action, where morals don't get mixed up. Because that's the beauty of this film. Don't get me wrong, I love a good thought provoking complex plot, but the simplicity of this film is just magical. You make good and bad decisions in life. Those who choose to act for good keep their lives and the baddies get served their justice. Personally, among his many incredible and touching films, this truly does shine as Steven Spielberg's greatest movie. It will stay in my heart and many other's forever more as a highlight of cinema experiences in our childhoods. Who could help but cheer as a young child when Indie runs along the submarine's top!",9,1,2,26 March 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Let me get one thing straight
","I have read many reviews of this film, and in fact don't think it needs another, but for the purpose of persuading other readers of these reviews to watch this great film, I want to say this: Many reviews I have read of Inglourious Basterds say that this film lacked morals and meaning and that it portrayed Jews as Nazis. Well guess what. This film is full of morals. The Basterds take on the immoral choice to retaliate against the Tyranny Of The Third Reich, by reacting in the same ways the Nazis tortured and systematically killed Jews. People say that what the film shows is people actually being worse than Nazis. Well they're wrong. We all ways read about brave survivors of Concentration Camps, and how their experiences haven't shaken their belief, nor made them vengeful. But we never read about the darker survivors. Well this film shows them. The people that wanted to get back at the Nazis at any cost. That is what this film is about. A lot of stupid, brutish Americans going to France to just roam around on a killing spree, killing absolutely every German whether it's logical or morally right to. It's about stone cold vengeance. And it's fantastic.",Null,1,5,20 July 2011
Taxi Driver," Masterpiece
","Martin Scorsese IS an artist. Anyone who says otherwise has no right to call themselves a fan of cinema. And Taxi Driver, is certainly one of his best ever movies, if not the best. Personally, my favourite Scorsese film is raging bull. However, you would be standing on very firm ground to argue that Taxi Driver was the better film.First of all, De Niro probably gives his career performance. It is certainly his most iconic. He plays Travis, a troubled ex-marine who is suffering from insomnia and decides to take a job as a late night taxi driver. From the moment we see him, it is instantly clear that although he is present, there is a sinister atmosphere that shows that Travis is simply not there. He clearly is somehow mentally unstable. He isn't your average guy. He becomes easily obsessed, and becomes very troubled by very small things. So when he becomes completely infatuated with Betsy, who works for a presidential candidate. He also acquires the strange habit of going to view porn films in the cinema. He doesn't enjoy them, but he is rather fascinated by them.So, as you can see, this is one psycho weirdo that would even send Jack Nicholson running for the hills. It required an exceptional actor to rise to the challenge of playing such a complex and emotional character. Que. young Robert De Niro. Who would have ever thought that one of cinemas greatest ever talents was so finely suited to the screen from such a young age. Like I said, his best ever performance. It is still baffling to me as to how he didn't win the academy award. They clearly have no idea what they are talking about. Actually, the film also deserved the academy award.The rest of the cast do an excellent job. Jodie Foster too stands out as a young talent. She is one of my personal favourite actresses, and she shone from a very young age. Harvey Keitel also stands out as a good young talent. It's like seeing all our favourite modern stars before they were mega stars. Keitel plays the absolute scum of the earth. He is completely sick, arrogant, sleazy, vile little s***. He deserved the academy award for best supporting actor.So all in all, this is arguably the best film of the seventies (which automatically makes it arguably the best ever film since the godfather one and two are from the seventies.) It amazes me that Scorsese made this into one of the best of the 70's, He made raging bull which is hands down the best film of the 80's and goodfellas which again is arguably the best film of the 90's. AND he made the departed, probably the best film of the 21st century so far.But I still can't figure out why it's called Taxi Driver (Just Kidding) ;)",10,0,0,25 March 2011
American Psycho," An American Gem
","Wow. What a film! All I can say is that this is one of my all time favourite films. It just keeps you entertained. Christian Bale is absolute genius. He goes from being a crazy and deluded killer, to a panicky nerd, to a corny music-buff know-it-all, to a self obsessed business man. And just as Bale's performance does, the story also jumps around. It start out as a Sex In The City style narrated romantic comedy, to an extremely sick and black comedy, to a grisly horror. The scenes where Bateman is explaining his albums are hilarious, as is the scene where he says, 'I experienced a moment of sheer panic when I noticed that his apartment looks out over the park, and was clearly more expensive than mine.' as is the business card scene. And the chainsaw scene is very intense. I have to say though, for it's reputation as a very violent film, although graphic, most violence is offscreen. My only criticism is the mass murder scene where the car blows up. It if is a hallucination, then it works fine, but if you are in the same belief group as me, (That it all really happened) then you may fell that it is completely implausible and a plot gap. Having said that, this film is my first EVER 10/10.",10,0,0,20 March 2011
Raging Bull," In My Top 3
","Like I said, this film is in my top 3 films ever made, along with The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction. I think that it is debatably De Niro's best performance ever (but is he better in taxi driver?), and it was first line up of De Niro, Pesci and Scorsese, one of the best cinematic trios ever. So, enough has been said for me to make even the most cynical people out there believe me that the acting in this is absolutely top quality. The directing is incredible. The stylish black and white makes this stand out among other movies and really gives some strong ground as to when this story was set. The fight scenes are among the best scenes in cinematic history, and the most brutal. Just be warned, this film is not for children. The violence in emotionally intense and the language is foul (yet appropriate and accurate.). Having said that, anyone from fourteen to fifteen should be okay with this. So if you don't believe me that this is one of the best films ever, at least acknowledge that it is easily the best film of the eighties, which is some achievement.",10,2,2,20 March 2011
X-Men: First Class," The Best X-Men movie yet!
","I have always been a massive fan of marvel. Ever since I was a kid, I've loved the entire world I was able to escape to. I was never a massive fan of the spider-man movies as a kid (except spider-man 2), because they felt untrue to the comics. However, X-men has always had exactly the same feel as the comic books did. The order the films were made in was the order of my favourites (1,2, last stand, wolverine.) But my favourite part of the entire X-men universe was Magneto and Professor X's rivalry. So naturally I was very excited but slightly anxious, hoping it wouldn't fallow the deterioration of the rest of the franchise. Well, luckily it didn't.First of all, Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are absolutely brilliant. Their scenes together were almost as exciting as Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in HEAT. I've always loved the idea that arch-enemies can be trying to destroy each other, and then the next minute be sat civilised over a dinner. Like political leaders.I loved Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen performances, but who's was better. That is debatable. The rest of the cast give a fairly good to very good range of performances, but the film does really centre around Charles and Erik, so that doesn't effect it too much.The opening plays out like an Oscar winning film. There is so much Drama, emotion, and contrast. I'm not sure if Kevin Baker played the younger Shaw at the beginning, but if he did, he was excellent. It would also be the highlight of the movie for him if he did. It reminded me a lot of Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds. His performance did get slightly weaker as the film progressed though.The script is amazing. Very funny, witty and not afraid to laugh at itself. There are lots of 'Tips of the hat' to the earlier films, referencing characters and specific situations. It reminded me slightly of how Red Dragon 'tipped it's hat' to Silence Of The Lambs at the end.My only picky moans are that every so often, you hear the slightest hint of Fassbender's Irish accent, which does sometimes draw away from the realism of the film. Also, I really did have to say 'Yeah, okay.' about Kevin Baker's character coming back and secretly being a mutant all along. But, all in all very good. 7.5 (imdb wouldn't let me put that half.)Favourite scene: Hugh Jackman's cameo.",7,0,2,5 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The End, Of The End
","Harry Potter is kind of a special series in the sense that as me and many others have grown up watching this series, this series has also grown up, like Andy in Toy Story. The movies have progressively got more mature and darker, showing the complications of life as we get older. So this was pretty big.Well, it did not disappoint. This is definitely my favourite HP film. The entire tone just shifted YET AGAIN to a darker one, with many, many characters which we have grown up with dying. There is one especially grim scene where we see an entire courtyard of dead corpses. So I would say that although it originally set out as kids movies, this is no longer the case. In the UK this is a hard 12 rated film, and should be considered. However, brave ten year olds HAVE to see it!The acting has improved with the series, and watching them back, the acting was already very impressive. There's no question that the actors and actresses have become there characters.With a twist and many touching goodbye to the series scenes, this was indeed a moving movie that shall be no doubt, in time, be regarded as a classic of our age of cinema.Have to say though, the very last scene made me laugh for all the wrong reasons. But they meant well and were true to the book. Anyway, still a freaking awesome film!",Null,0,0,19 July 2011
Casino," Buries other films alive
","Casino is definitely one of the best films of the nineties. And when you take the time to think about it, that is quite an accusation, when it is competing with films such as:GoodFellas The Shawshank Redemption Forrest Gump Pulp Fiction American BeautyIt is brilliantly told and brilliantly acted. Although Stone and Pesci are impressive, De Niro once again steals the show for me. The scene when he drags Ginger out of the house is one of his best scenes to date. Pesci once again takes the roll as De Niro's best friend Psycho/Ladies man killer. He is excellent, although his performance in GoodFellas was his finest hour. Stone gives her best performance to date. You really hate the character, as Martin Scorsese intended. I do believe, that although it is similar to GoodFellas, it is different in its own way, as GoodFellas makes grit look glamorous, and Casino makes glamour look gritty. And so, I leave you with this. I think that Casino's story is actually better than GoodFellas. I'm not saying that it is a better film, but in my opinion, Casino has a better and more thought out story.",Null,2,3,20 March 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Last decent Jones film
","This is the last good Jones film before the emotional roller coaster that is Shia Labeouf ruined it. It is also the second best Indie movie, behind Raiders Of The Lost Arc, and is arguably better. The casting of Shaun Connery was genius. It is also a sign of respect, as I believe that his portrayal as 007 James Bond was an inspiration for 'Junior'. It is certainly the funniest Indie film. It was the perfect ending to a very personal and favourite trilogy, and I will try to ignore George Lucas' greedy fourth money making film. Because that is all it was, a quick money making scheme that upset and betrayed many, many fans. But like I said, I wont dwell on that and I will discard it as part of the trilogy. Check out the 'How It Should Have Ended' for Indiana Jones 4, I think you lovers of the first trilogy will laugh :)",9,2,3,20 March 2011
