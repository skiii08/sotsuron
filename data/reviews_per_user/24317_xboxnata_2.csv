Hereditary," Below Average
","I'm giving Hereditary a 3/10 reason why it escapes being anything lower for me is because I found certain elements of the movie interesting and I laughed a lot in the end.
Overall weird story telling and terrible pacing makes this a movie I will soon want to forget!",3,0,6,9 July 2019
1917," Masterpiece
","I have soo many thoughts on 1917 but I'll keep this short.
1917 is by far one of the greatest films I've had the pleasure in viewing and experiencing. The most immersive film I've experienced in my life. Not only was this a great war film but just a great film in general. Right up there with other great war films like Saving Private Ryan, We Were Soldiers, and Hacksaw Ridge. A beautiful artistic, character driven film, a journey I won't soon be forgetting. A must see in any premium format you can manage to view it in.
