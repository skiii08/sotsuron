Howl's Moving Castle," Belongs In the Toilet with many other crappy movies!
","ICK! This movie was so stupid! The only good thing about it is the animation, sort of. The story was so bizarre. Is this seriously what Japanese kids enjoy for entertainment? Here is the story line: Sophie (who is always looking for attention/sympathy by saying she is ugly) makes friends with a fairy wizard named Howl and he really does act gay. She then is attacked by the Witch of the waste who is very fat and becomes old. Then Sophie climbs aboard Howl's Moving Castle and becomes his cleaning lady, helps him with his (insert shocking music here) bad hair days, and becomes a little boy's (who has a beard) mother figure, la la la , everything is happy, the world is good, and I can't wait for this movie to end!Please don't see this. It is dumb.",1,14,67,2 April 2006
