The Blair Witch Project," truly sickening
","if you are a person that is considering seeing this movie you should be prepared to be motion sick for the rest of the night. the movie itself was pretty good except for the whole script being the 'F' word. the movie was very believable. the three who made this movie were very smart. i do commend them on that, but as i whole i would not encourage anyone to go pay $6.00 to see this movie.",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
