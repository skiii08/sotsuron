It," A collection of Crap that floats too
","This movie was a collection of scenes thrown together with no cohesiveness or logic what so ever. There will be spoilers in this review so if you did not see it yet, by pass this review. The kids are not just kids, there dumb kids with no intelligence or wit whatsoever. I looked at this movie, as if I knew nothing about the original. So if you know nothing about the original like many people who were born in the early or mid 90's and up, this movie will not explain anything to you. Here is a quick breakdown of this dumb movie for you. You have a group of kids, dumb kids I might add, who see's apparitions in there town where they live in various places. These apparitions are caused by some evil entity that is a 'Clown', or at least that is his disguise. No one else see's this clown or his many disguises that he uses. Wanna know why? Me too. Only kids can see him. Wanna know why? Me too. Movie doesn't explain it. The clown killed a couple kids in this movie, and had the chance to kill some of the kids in the 'main' group, but didn't. Wanna know why? Me too. The kids were scared petrified, but in the movie they said they weren't afraid, but their running around town screaming bloody murder. People usually do that when their scared. Not in the movie 'IT'. I guess they were just getting exercise.The lead girl Beverly was being molested by her Father which was despicable. Towards the end of the movie she cracked him in the head with the top of the toilet bowl, leaving him unconscious on the bathroom floor bleeding from the back of the head, not moving. I'm assuming he's dead. At the end, she moves away to live with her Aunt in Portland. And her Dad? Who knows. As far as I know he's still laying there as I type this. She never called the Cops, her aunt never called the Cops, no Police report, no questioning, for murdering her FATHER! She just gets to move away. Oh, and one of the kids whose name is 'Michael', killed a kid that was bullying him by knocking him down a well. No one's looking for that kid I guess. And I can guess like Beverly, their will be no Cops, no Police report, no juvenile detention, life just goes on.If I did not have movie pass, and paid some outrageous price for this ticket, I would have been livid. The Clown does many different things to scare the kids and they all work, the kids go running and screaming and hiding. All he does is scare them, never kill them, like he did others. Wanna know why? Me too. But at the end, the very end, they are no longer scared of the Clown. Maybe that's because he never kills any of them, just plays a bunch of scary practical jokes. The Clown in 'IT' is just that, a Clown.The End. There will be a sequel, as it said the End of Chapter one when the movie went off. Chapter one is enough for me. You can keep Chapters 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 through infinity. If you want to watch a evil Clown do 2-hours of scare tactics, then this is the flick for you. If you want something with substance and a compelling and interesting story line, You wont' get that here. You'll float too. Your thoughts that is when your watching this. Most people call it daydreaming.",2,2,7,5 October 2017
Fight Club," Movie with many layers, but the intelligent and analytical will be able to peel them
","Hi fellow film lovers. As far as movie goes, it's a classic. This is really for the people who tore it down, or more specifically the people who tore other people down for liking it. If you didn't get get it, it's because most likely your like Edward Norton's boss in the movie, or your like most people. This movie wasn't made for MOST people, this movie was targeted at an audience that knows there is something disturbingly wrong with our world, society, and our culture today.If you did not see that, it's because you Can't See it. So bashing this movie or people who like this movie, (More specifically those who like it, everyone's entitled to their own opinions)just proves not only do not see the decay and regress our cultural society, but that you are also apart of engine that drives it.",10,5,10,29 July 2010
42," Emotional, Inspirational, and Inspiring!!
","42 was nothing short of superb. The acting was some of the best acting I've EVER seen. Chadwick Boseman who plays Jackie Robinson did a Phenomenal job playing Jackie. Harrison Fords role of Branch Rickey was equally superb. The movie was so original and free from the clich√©'s that many movies suffer from now and days. The most pivotal statement in that movie takes place between Harrison Ford's character Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson played by Boseman. Harrison says 'I'm not looking for someone who has the guts to fight back, I'm looking for someone who has the guts not to fight back'. This statement alone, sums of the excellent acting, scripting, and emotional delivery of the film. This movie was supported by a talented cast who played their characters to a T, and really help bring this movie to the cusp of greatness. The emotions exhibited by Boseman's character was felt sorely by the viewer, especially if you are African American. I don't want to give away many scenes of this incredible film, but it is one the best films I've seen in the movies, and that I have seen period. I admired the character of Harrison's character Branch, the strength and support of Robinson's wife played by Nicole Beharie, and the resolve of Lucas Black playing Pee Wee Reese. But most critical character who delivered a heroic performance was Boseman. Excellent film, excellent acting, excellent script, superb directing.",10,6,8,26 April 2013
Control," Very personal, Introspective insight on one mans life and struggles
","I am usually a reader of IMDb. I can count on 2 hands how many reviews I've left concerning films I've seen. Sometimes because the movie had been summed up do beautifully by others writings that I felt there was nothing more I could add, but also, I have to move to do such a thing for a film. I am not very verse in Punk music, but in my growing time on this earth, which has been short, I've come to realize that all music is good. What I mean when I say that is that in all in genre's of music, you have good music(artist), and not so good ones. Johnny Cash, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Ian Curtis.I was not familiar with him or his music, much as I was not familiar with Johnny Cash before I watched a biography on him. I like Johnny Cash, and now, also, I like Ian Curtis. Aside from the music that he created, we saw an up close and personal account, events, emotional strife and moral conflict in the soul of one person. The conflict(s) of doing whats right and expected, versus doing what's right and fulfilling. It's ironic this movie is in Black and White, because this movie is far from black and white, there's many shades to this person's life.Lead Actor Sam Riley who played Ian Curtis did a phenomenal job and really conveyed the emotions and moral conflict of the character and is constant struggle to hold on to what's fulfilling and what is expected of him. At the same time, he is dealing with a health issue, that at that time, there was not really a whole lot that could be done for him. Ian died at a very young age, but did a lot in that very young age. He was married and a father, had a mistress, and was in famous band. Very young to have these kind of decisions and moral dilemma's to answer to.We can see that the character was different, saw things different. It's this difference that allowed him to write the way he did and express the way he did. I am not sure where his depression came from, I know the side-effects just enhance these feelings and fears, but I do not know where they actually began for Ian.Debbie, played by Samantha Morton, was also amazing. She said in the film that too her Ian isn't famous, he's just Ian, 'I still wash his undershorts'. Where as his extra marital affair Annik knows him only as 'Ian Curtis' joy division. Both Debbie and Annik know him in 2 different ways.The acting in the film was nothing short of superb. Strongest performances turned in by Sam Riley and Samantha Morton. I felt every emotion exhibited by the characters, individually and co-joined. And felt as if it was happen to me or right in front of me at times. But Sam Riley put on a extraordinary performance not 1 whisper shy of greatness. He took this script and this character and made him his own.Now you see why I wrote this review. There should be not doubt in your mind if you read this far. If doesn't move me, I don't write. This movie clearly did...",10,1,1,23 July 2010
Gran Torino," This movie is a 10!
","This movie is a 10! A 10! Just read the comments and ratings of everyone else. I have nothing to add to this remarkable film that has not already been said. Clint Eastwood was simply, PHENOMENAL in this film. Brilliantly written, brilliantly directed. Clint Eastwood is brilliant! This is one of the best movies that I have seen in a while. Clint Eastwood deserves to win something for this film. Whether for directing it, or for the character that he portrays in Gran Torino. A lot of people have described his character Walt as being 'Racist', but I would have to disagree with that. In watching the Movie he let's a lot of racial slurs fly. His Character is very complex. What comes out of his mouth doesn't always line up to his actions. I would say he is more like a 'Archie Bunker' type from all in the Family. But a lot more complex. I don't wanna give a way the movie or the character, but I think Clint Eastwood broke ground with this character. Because Walt in a 'Non Traditional' racist. Whatever that means, lol. Clint Eastwood's character development of Walt, was phenomenal. The relationship between he and others are a site to see as well. This Movie was great, you will not be disappointed.",10,2,6,21 December 2008
Midsommar," Utter Trash...........
","Utter Trash. I love Florence Pugh. Pretty and convincing. Everyone else in the film, and I do mean everyone, SUCKED!!!!!!Utter Trash. One of the worse movies I've ever viewed. Good thing I didn't pay to see it. I would not spend one nickel on it.The High marks are from people who are high. Just like the characters throughout 90% of the movie. Like Rick James said: 'Cocaine is a hell of a drug'. So is 'shrooms' and everyone who gave this movie a 10 is on them right now.",1,22,38,26 September 2019
12 Years a Slave," Astounding movie with enormous emotion.
","Saw this movie today, and it stirred up a string of emotions in me. I have seen movies dealing with slavery before, but it has never impacted me as this movie did. Number one, the acting was impeccable from all sides by all actors. Chiwetel Ejiofor is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. He turned in a powerful performance, drawing in the emotions of the character Solomon Northup, a MAN, who was kidnapped and stripped away from his family and sold into Slavery. I could feel the emotion from the Character, but could not fathom being in that predicament. I will not make this review very long, simply because I could write an essay on all the good points of the film. The dialogue between Solomon (Pratt) and Patsey, played by Lupita Nyong'o was astounding, heart-breaking, and explicitly honest. The communication between the 2 characters capture the despair, misery, and hopelessness felt by my ancestors during that time of National injustice, moral decadence, and Godlessness in the Laws, behaviors, and attitudes by Slaver owners, and Slave smugglers. Acting was superb! I could not have picked a better cast. By the end of the film, I was just about in tears at the resolution and the emotion that ensued. A man's most prized possession is his freedom. Rob any man of that unjustly, and soon his hope, spirit, and soul will follow. But Solomon, was a man who did not, and would not give let his soul, and his spirit fall into despair and hopelessness. When I look back and think about all the evil, maniacal, heinous, hideous, and despicable things we did, I can't help but shake my head. It is not a man in a red suit with horns we need to be afraid of, it is us. We are the worse of the worse. Who is the judge of what's morally right and what's immoral? Us? You gotta be kidding!! We KNOW that things we do are immorally wrong, but use the 'Law' as a safety net to continue in evil doings. As Brad Pitts Character said in the movie, 'there is State law, federal law, and then there is 'Universal Law'. The y may pass a law tomorrow saying it is lawful for a man to lay with a 10 yr old girl and marry. But because it's 'lawful' does that mean I would partake?? Regardless of what that law says, that act is incomprehensible!! Christ Law super-cedes man's law every time. One reviewer wrote he believes Solomon and the 2 men who sold him into slavery were trying to pull some 'scam' to make money and Solomon got the short end of the stick. That's what I mean, freedom, the freedom to say something as idiotic as that.",10,1,4,29 January 2014
1408," Masterpiece
","This is was absolutely one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. Yes, it's more of a psychological thriller then a horror movie, but none the less is an amazing movie. One of the best horror/psychological films to come out in a longggggggggggggg time. We are bombarded today by hack and slash films with no depth or even good writing. If you like saw, and movies of the like and consider those to be good horror movies, 1408 is NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU. I repeat, IS NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU. People do not get chopped up in this movie, and there is not an abundance of blood or people screaming in agony from being tortured. I personally do not like those kinds of horror movies. They lack serious quality and depth. I don't find someone being chopped up or chainsawed up scary. I can see that anytime I want by turning on the news. Horror films today a lot of times mirror what's happening in our society, so it's hard to be scarred by it. John Cusak was sensational in his role. Absolutely amazing. His range of emotional display in the movie was very impressive and believable. His character sucks you right into the movie. Samuel L. Jacksons role though small but poignant, created a masterpiece of dialog between him and Cusaks character. I could write more but from my rating you can see where I'm going with this. If you like The Shining, and movies along those lines, then you'll love this movie. If psychological thrillers are not your thing and you prefer Saw, Jason, or anyone with a chainsaw or a huge ax, you may want to skip it. As for me, it was a masterpiece.",10,0,1,9 December 2007
Mother!," Sacrilegious and Blasphemous
","Oh Mother.... Where do I begin.I'll start with the good. Jennifer Lawrence is beautiful. A lot of film time is spent on her face and the different emotions she exhibits throughout the film. So if you don't like her face, don't see this movie. If you like her face, you'll get to see a lot of it. Her acting is always great in my opinion, even in films that I don't particularly care for. Her performance always deliver. Now the bad, and there's a whole lot of that. This film is sacrilegious to the highest degree. If you hold faith (Christianity) strong to your heart, this piece of junk film will offend you. I was offended when this film went off. I was offended Spiritually and morally. The movie was NOTHING like what the trailer portrayed. Had I known before hand, I would of never contributed to this garbage. You are not getting a 'Thriller' here. No 'Psychological Thriller', Suspense Thriller, as portrayed, what you will get is a Sacrilegious pile of crap thrown together to hopefully land on someones face who will say 'it's art!'. Save your money and time. If you must, watch when it hits cable. If you are a Christian, skip all together. If you love good movies and your a Christian, skip all together. If your are not a Christian and love good movies, skip all together. There's a scene at the end that is just 'sick'. Smh. when the credits rolled, everyone in the Theater exited silently. No applause, no cheers, just silence. I was not the only one appalled by what took place at the end.",1,12,20,25 September 2017
