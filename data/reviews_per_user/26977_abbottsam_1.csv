Iron Man 3," Read this before you rate/write a review for Iron Man 3
","Visually amazing, but slightly insulting to the audience.Iron Man 3, which is seemingly only set a short time after The Avengers and Tony Stark is up to Mark 47 armor! Yet Tony only has Mark I to Mark VII on display in his garage and uses the new Mark 47 as his new 'daily drive'. Mark VIII to Mark 46 are apparently stored in a secure sub- basement level below Stark's garage. All prototypes; Stark's intentions for use of these 39 armors are never revealed, although there are some hints. Poor hints, but hints.Never-the-less, 40 armors in the space of about a year = what the hell? He did quite well with Mark III to Mark VII for four years, 2008-2012. To go from seven (in total) armors in four years to building 41 (in total) in one year seems unrealistic and stupid.The reasons given is that Stark is paranoid since the events of The Avengers. Gods and Aliens and threat of wars from powers unknown to human kind plague Stark's mind. He is losing sleep and spends all of his time building suits to suit different purposes depending on the kinds of threats the earth might face in the future.But this makes no sense, as it appears since The Avengers that Iron Man has basically been retired by the Iron Patriot (War Machine/Rhodes), which also makes no sense!Where was Rhodes during the events of The Avengers? No reference for this was given. Why did the government feel the need to put such faith in the Iron Patriot program when it was Iron Man who led the defence against the invasion in The Avengers?The Iron Patriot armor was obviously new (as the semi-restored Mark II armor was now back in the Stark Garage) and obviously Stark tech. Why did Stark build a specific set of armor for the government? Throughout Iron Man (2008) Stark said he was done building weapons for the government. Throughout Iron Man 2 Stark said he was never going to let anyone else get hands on his technology and the government specifically 'can't have it'. Now all of a sudden we are meant to believe he just up and decides to build a new set of armor for government use? I don't get it, sorry.Where was SHIELD and The Avengers? Surely they would have been on hand regarding these major acts of terrorism and presidential threats? Or at least on hand or around to assist Tony in his various moments of crisis'?... Particularly Captain America; he's already a Government sanctioned super hero. Where was he? Was painting the Iron Patriot in Captain America's colors a slap in the face to Capt Rogers, especially considering again, he was instrumental in the defence against the alien invasion. Again, where was Rhodes and why the focus on Iron Patriot?Extremis was OTT.The Mandarin twist was stupid.Why didn't they tie The Mandarin into the foundation they laid with 10 Rings from the first Iron Man film?Mark 47 was an extremely unreliable unit for a piece of Stark tech. Why didn't he use one of the Mark VIII to Mark 46 suits as his 'daily drive' while the Mark 47 was still in beta testing? What was with the power issues hinted throughout the film? Are these suits not powered by their own individual arc reactors? Is that not self-sustaining energy? This makes the whole Mark 47 storyline (damage and repair etc.) really quite stupid, un-understandable and weird. Bottom line could Tony have not used energy from his personal arc reactor in an emergency type situation? So what was with the hooking up of Mark 47 to freaking car battery to 'charge it up'? Am I the only one asking this stuff?!If Tony had 39 other suits just hanging around in lock up, why did he use The Avengers damaged Mark VII to meet up with Rhodes for a meal?Why did he use a suit at all to just meet up with Rhodes? Doesn't he usually drive most places as Tony Stark?Why was Mark VII just parked there out the front, open? Couldn't anyone just hop in there and take off? Or at least throw it on a trailer and nick it?I don't understand why someone with Tony Stark's resources couldn't get all of those suits out of the ocean sooner Like, straight away.Ben Kingsley is the best actor in the world.I'm all for humor, but the chance for a darker, more epic end to the trilogy was missed – we won't get that chance back.If Tony was so paranoid about further invasions and threats to Earth, hence building 41 suits in total in a year, why then destroy them all on a whim because Pepper has a whinge about Tony not spending enough time with her?! Priorities Pepper, jeez! And Tony, letting a woman tell him what to do?!If it was so easy to take the shrapnel out of Tony's heart, why wasn't that done as soon as he was rescued in 2008? Why go through all of the trouble of creating a better arc half way through the first film, then palladium poisoning and a new element and core in the second film? Especially considering from Iron Man 2 onward all suits had their own independent reactors and didn't run off of Tony's anyway. So in theory he could have done away with a personal arc a long time ago it seems Sorry, it all just seems like a gigantic waste of time and has destroyed the credibility of everything that came before it in the first two films?I feel like writing and alternative Iron Man 3 just to highlight what they could and should have done.This movie was weak and nonsensical (and deep down, you know it)!",4,30,60,28 April 2013
