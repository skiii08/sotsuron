Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," An analysis of the negative reviews
","I agree with everything the positive reviewers say, so there's not much point in rehashing there.However, I think it's pretty interesting, taken as a whole, to see what the negative reviewers here have to say (or, more accurately, the sorts of things that they are hung up on). Their words, ironically, only strengthen Baron Cohen's whole 'point.' Looking through the bad reviews, many people are hung up on the scene with the naked fat man and Borat. Fair enough. That was to be expected. But read through them and see just how many people seemed fit to mention a tiny, insignificant moment in the movie where a static picture of a penis is barely shown.The movie overflows with examples of racism, sexism, and tons of other nasty things that other reviewers will have described to you. But the one thing that comes up over and over again in the negative reviews is the basically non-sexual, very brief, static portrayal of a man's genitals. The sexism and racism barely get a mention.I'll let you draw your own conclusions.",9,1,6,28 December 2006
G.I. Jane," An excellent movie except for the last 25 minutes.
","I finally got around to seeing GI Jane. Quite a good movie - the brutality of the training bits really puts into context what women might face in combat and the 'real', not theoretical brutality they face.Unfortunately, an otherwise excellent movie loses out due to a tacked-on and militarily nonsensical battle scene which occupies the last 25 minutes. The movie should have ended after Demi gave the Senator an ultimatum and she is seen, in the distance, rejoining her unit in training. By that point, all of the major hurdles and challenges will have been overcome, and we would know that the future would be there as she was to make it. It would have been a fitting ending. The dumb battle scene in the end was just awful on many levels.",7,1,3,6 September 2013
Kung Fu Panda," Good Fight Scnes can't save inept script, miscast voices, and wrong messages.
","There's just so much money involved in the creation of the current breed of animated/cg movies that they rarely strike out. Indeed, I found even mediocrely-reviewed fare such as 'monsters vs aliens' to actually be quite good and appreciable on an adult level with lots of intelligent jokes and the occasional innuendo.But not 'Kung Fu Panda.' Kung Fu Panda is awful.Here's the plot: fat, lazy, wisecracking panda boy is surprisingly chosen to be 'the one' to defend against big bad guy, much to the chagrin of five sidekick kung-fu master animals who have spent their lifetimes in training and work. initially, they reject him since he's a fat lazy panda. will he find the solution, a combination of 'believing in himself' and taking advantage of his 'alternate but just as good talents' (he's fat, so he can be motivated by food) to defeat the bad guy and save the day? alas, yes. the plot is just that stupid, sending all the wrong messages. in kung fu panda's America, you don't have to do the math or practice for more than a few token montage scenes. you just 'believe in yourself.' this line of nonsense used to what they used to console kids on the slow bus with, but is now what passes for 'inclusive education' or some-such. and mind you, I'm an extreme political liberal (though a well educated one) writing this.but, even such inanity could be salvageable if the jokes and acting along the way were any good. they're not. the A-list quality supporting voice talent in addition to B-list quality lead Jack Black are utterly miscast. Angelina Jolie is wasted and unnecessary, though I'm sure she was glad for the check for her afternoon of work. did anybody here go see the movie because Angelina Jolie or Dustin Hoffman were cast? then why did they bother? one suspects a massive kickback scheme is in place - how else to explain why major stars land well paying voice animated rolls that probably do nothing to drawing audiences? the only good to be gotten out of this absolutely miserable movie are the fight scenes. i'm not usually one for fight scenes (and this movie didn't change this), but at times they were clever enough. there was no groundbreaking animation in this movie; I just mean to say that if you happen to like kung fu fight scenes, then you'll probably enjoy the ones here. i personally found those in 'crouching tiger hidden dragon' far more satisfying, but I can't say that those here were in any way bad for what they were. the 'dumpling scene' was particularly well done.the only thing that this movie had that in any way broke the usual stereotypes was the depiction of the prison that held the 'long caged' bad guy in the beginning. his jailers, for once, were not total dupes.i, however, felt like a total dupe after watching this very poor movie - doubly so since it was recommended to me as being particularly well written.conclusion: worst animated/cgi film i've seen in at least the last decade.",3,2,7,16 April 2010
Midnight in Paris," Endearing and memorable, if imperfectly written and acted.
","This is a compact movie with a simple conceit that initially looks to be hokey but ends up driving home its payoff quite memorably. Were the writing and acting better, it could have been a classic, but alas it falls well short of that mark. Owen Wilson was an acting high point, but even then his performance was just OK - nobody else was in the least bit identifiable as an actual human rather than an actor playing to a script. True, some of the the 'historical' figures were supposed to be caricatures, but even beyond this, the 'deeper' characters had no depth or chemistry. Worst of all, for a movie supposedly set around Paris, all I saw was a really poor American take on Paris; very little reminded me of that city which I know quite well. Heck, the 'French' characters' 'Frenglish' accents were barely identifiable as such.A real pity, since, as I said, the payoff and the idea were very decent for a compact movie like this. I did not dislike it, but thought the acting and writing let the whole thing down quite a bit. A 90 minute good date movie for an undergraduate trying to impress a girl who fancies herself an intellectual but has never been to Paris.",6,0,0,29 March 2015
The Way Back," This movie should be about Ukrainians, not Poles.
","Finally - finally a major motion picture that paints a sobering picture of the brutality of Stalin's gulags. Even though roughly equal numbers of innocents died under Stalin as did under Hitler, this brings the current score in terms of major motion picture to something like: Holocaust/Hitler: 84,245, Stalin: 1 or maybe 2. Anyway, it's a start.The movie follows a small group of a prisoners on their long walk / escape out of Siberia to freedom. Amazingly, a significant percentage of the group are Poles. One other is a Latvian, and another an American. To say that this mix would be unusual in a Gulag in 1939-1940 might be the understatement of the year. Why, by comparison, are Ukrainians, who would make up a noticeable segment (if not an outright majority or close to it) of political prisoners in an actual Gulags strangely absent? The story would be historically plausible were the actors Ukrainian nationalists taken from western Ukraine. The Soviets would not have bothered to send a polish military man (as the lead character was) all the way to Siberia--certainly one accused of sabotage and spying, as ours here was, would have likely been shot outright. However, I guess it's hard enough to get audiences, even 'enlightened' ones as might go watch this film to warm up to the story at all, so the director had to anchor the main characters as Poles, something that western audiences might be able to latch onto easily. It's a pity nevertheless.While the gulag scenes were obviously not filmed in Siberia (and nor, I'm guessing, was any of the film) they were more or less well done. However, the film as a whole lacked authenticity and believability. Even if you believe the story to be a metaphor for the whole soviet experience or something, it still should be told well, and I can't say that it was. The characters are remarkably well fed. It is difficult to get a sense of space. And, crucially, it doesn't feel like a walk.I've done some long walks in tough conditions. The most obvious thing is that when you are tired, you walk in a file, not abreast, as walking in a single line saves brain energy as you just look at the feet in front of you. the characters here must have found that to be not photogenic.so, 10/10 for the idea and concept, but, alas, 3/10 for execution. it just didn't resonate. i don't think it was a good parable of the struggles under communism, and, by its focus on poles, i don't think it's particularly good history, either. finally, despite what some critics say, i don't really think the characters flesh out that well.5/10 stars.",5,3,7,12 October 2011
Gone with the Wind," One of the most overrated films of all time.
","Easily perhaps the most over-rated film of all time, 'Gone with the Wind' would be a better movie if it ended with the war. The first half of the movie is a solid 7 out of ten nostalgic/historical piece - the script (of the first half) could be tighter and the characters a bit more realistic, but it's 'good enough' and the large budget produced some great scenes to push it up a few notches. However, the second half of the movie is an unmittigatable disaster with more schlock and worse acting than anything that ever pushed detergent on afternoon TV. End result? A disjointed, overlong, overly sappy train wreck of a movie. While I am sure that this movie appeals to people who like the 'fairy tale' aspect to the story and the romantic idea of Southern Belles and gentlemen like Rex Butler, for me, GWTW borders on unwatchable.",4,8,22,15 December 2005
Batman Begins," Much better than previous Batmen, but still a dumb action movie
","I must apologize at first - I don't particularly like 'escapist' action movies. Fighting, explosions, that kind of nonsense doesn't particularly appeal to me (unless they are in a realistic, perhaps philosophical, and otherwise dramatic movie, in which case I love em - the Thin Red line is one of my favorites). 'Batman Begins' was probably one of the best 'escapist' action movies that I have ever seen, but my review (and ranking) are doubtlessly slanted by the fact that I think the genre in general is, well, kinda dumb. And, make no mistake about it, this was an escapist action movie, despite any pretenses to anything deeper.I was fortunate enough to have tickets to the premiere in London last night, and, since it was a Sunday night and I had nothing better to do, I went. The acting is solid - few problems there. The casting was quite good, though Katie Holmes, Batman, and the Scarecrow were all miscast. Katie and (especially) the Scarecrow are just too young for the roles that they are supposed to be - while this is standard for Hollywood, here it was pushing it beyond even what would normally be acceptable. Batman himself was fine, but very generic and anonymous looking. I was quietly people watching and getting plastered at the after party at the Royal Courts of Justice and it took me some time to recognize that one of the people I was idly watching was in fact the same guy I had just spent a couple hours watching on the big screen. The guy who played Bruce Wayne's (murdered) father I think is the same guy who played the bad guy in the Ocean's eleven movies. He did a decent job, but I couldn't see his face on screen without instantly wondering 'what's terry Benedict doing here?' Maybe that's just me.The plot had aspirations to greatness and was, for the most part, competently written, save for a few glaring holes (possible spoiler alerts below). As has doubtlessly been pointed out elsewhere, the screenwriters carefully tried to fit as much of the standard batman lore artifacts into the movie as they could. most worked, some didn't. For example, the whole 'Bruce Wayne as playboy by day' shtick was left out of the previous movies (as far as my vague recollection of them goes) with good reason, it seems - it seems tacked on and adds-little while diminishing credibility.The bad guy suffers from classic 'idiot genius' flaws, but I guess since this is a comic book movie by definition that has to be ignored. well, sort of .. you can either accept that 'idiot genius' is required for this kind of movie OR you can try to pretend that this is an adult, 'intellectual' movie. You can't have both, I think, though lord know this movie tried. if the bad guy's plot was smarter, my review would have been up at least a point.Speaking of pretenses to being an adult movie, there's a whole lot of what at first pass might appear to be an exploration of the nature of fear. If it actually explored such themes competently (which I'm sure many vapid fan boys will incorrectly insist that it did), then my enthusiasm for this film would be much greater. As it is, while this movie seemed to be about analyzing the nature of fear, it never really gets beyond a few somewhat predictable throw-away lines. I want to stress that the movie was quite good for its genre. However, since gushing is doubtlessly well taken care of in other posts, I'll just make some random plot observations:I didn't like the bat car. It added nothing but excuses for stupid explosions, a lot of noise, and plot problems (how exactly is Bruce Wayne going to help stop crime in Gotham by destroying half of its police cars and potentially killing many of its cops, again?). i suspect the director had to include this, but, well, this is not for me. *Spoiler*. Maybe i missed it, but it was not clear to me what batman actually did at the end of the movie to stop the bad guy. so you have this doomsday train with the bad guy on it heading towards the center of town, where the bad guy will blow it up (well, not exactly, but I'm simplifying for explanation here). so batman gives the bat mobile to his policeman friend who drives to just before the building, and basically shoots out the tracks, causing the train to crash and the happy village is saved. meanwhile, batman boards the train and fights the bad guy and manages to jump out of the train just before it crashes. you might say 'well, batman slowed down the bad guy, allowing the policeman friend time to get into position.' Not really. the train is going at top speed anyway, and plus we saw plenty of time wasted by the policeman trying to get to grips with driving the car. in other words, batman didn't actually contribute in any meaningful way to the ultimate demise of the bad guy other than giving his friend the car keys.in a rare moment of bad or unclear acting in this film, it was never really apparent from Katie Holmes actions / expressions / whatever that she had been poisoned.the sets were spectacular and the cinematography itself brilliant for this kind of fare. the pacing of the movie was superb. special effects were great, if you care for that kind of thing. nice surprise ending to the 'personal' story at the end and a very nice lead in to potential future movies.best batman ever. maybe best escapist action movie ever. competent acting. a few plot holes. a dumb genre. imagine the results if such brilliance would be used for something other than burger king merchandising fuel!7/10",7,2,10,13 June 2005
The Pianist," A decent, but unspectacular Holocaust movie
","The Pianist is a by the numbers movie about the life and times of a pianist trying to live through the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. A beautiful musical score predictably results. The pianist himself is an altogether unsympathetic character - we want him to live because we don't want to be cruel, but otherwise we wouldn't have any particular attraction to this man. The movie itself is strictly, for the most part, paint by numbers. Nazis are bad, Jews are innocent yet determined survivors. Well, more to the point, Nazis are bad, though deep down inside they appreciate fine culture and some of them have good hearts. The Soviets, on the other hand, are uniformly bad and stupid, it seems.The lessons of the Holocaust must never be forgotten. However, the pivotal lessons of the Holocaust are not 'Nazis are bad Jews are innocent yet determined survivors.' Those sort of lessons are historical details along the lines of 'The Magna Carta was signed in 1066.' The real lessons of the Holocaust center around what happens when we stop looking at each other as human beings and start looking at each other as cartoons or stereotypes. This is a by the numbers movie specifically because it does what most movies do - it starts with existing cartoon/stereotype views and builds characters around them to tell a story. A better movie would have begun in that place, but then used the power and magic of film to challenge our preconceptions and our stereotypes to truly convey and reinforce a message of hope for humanity.Your life will not be any poorer if you never see this movie, but you won't feel that you wasted your time, either, if you do. Certainly doesn't belong in the IMDb Top 250.",4,4,9,25 August 2006
Lincoln," One of the 50 greatest films of the last 100 years.
","Subtle. Thoughtful. Articulate. Historically Accurate. Brilliantly Acted.Ultimately, this movie is a greater tribute to one of the greatest US presidents than any 'straight' biography would have been. We don't need to see a young Abe splitting rails -- we can see his strength and independence clearly enough through day lewis's brilliant portrayal. we don't need to see the bullet entering his body at fords theater (as some juvenile commenters here have insisted); we understand the event better by watching the effects it had on the others, such as molly Todd Lincoln.we get great insight into politics -- both of the era and in general - especially through the eyes of Tommy lee Jones' perfect portrayal of Thad Stevens.but most of all, we see that truly great things like the emancipation proclamation and the 13th amendment were ultimately real things made by real people and not those by some to-be-over-idealized demi-gods.ignore the juveniles (who demand more 'action' or a more 'paint by numbers' biography) and the ideologues (who are offended by one aspect or another of the essentially accurately portrayed history) and see this film, start to finish, with no distractions. You just might find yourself watching it three times in a row, as I did.I give this film what I very very seldom give on IMDb: an unhesitating 10/10.",10,1,2,9 October 2013
Some Like It Hot," Funny, yes. But 'funniest'? No way.
","One other reviewer wrote: 'Lemmon's Daphne is one of the most incredible and masterful acting jobs in the history of cinema.' Such hyperbole pretty much says it all about this film. It's a wacky zany comedy. It's well written, so a good percentage of the jokes hit. Furthermore, the reviewers who noted that the film stands the test of time pretty well have got that right. It's still funny today.However, so are the Three Stooges.At the end of the day, this is a very good comedy. But, those who give it some sort of special or iconic status are doubtlessly seeing things through some Marilyn or other golden age colored glasses. The acting is not that much better than many other period films nor is the subject matter particularly differentiating (despite numerous claims otherwise in various other reviews, the guys-dressing-as-girls-and-getting-laughs idea was pretty well worn even by the late 50s.) Rather, good writing carries the day and makes it a great movie for a rainy Saturday afternoon.And nothing more.",1,16,60,2 January 2007
Ben-Hur," Classy Entertainment for Italian Grandmothers in Atlantic City
","A lot of people complained when Russell Crowe's 'Gladiator' won best picture. Not that Gladiator was bad, mind you, but rather that its simple storyline and characters seemed too, well, proletarian, for Oscar. 'Oscar', those people would say, 'used to be for innovative, good movies.' The example of Ben Hur should prove to such people that Oscar has always had tendencies towards being the NASCAR championship of film awards. Again, it's not a bad movie. However, it relies almost entirely on three tricks to convince the Harrah's Atlantic City Bus-riding set that this is high art.First, there was a giant budget to persuade that the film was somehow technically innovative. Throw enough money at anything and some innovation will occur, but Ben Hur was hardly groundbreaking in any significant way.Second, you need to have plenty of throw-away lines of pseudo-philosophy. Ben Hur simply crawls with them.Finally, to guarantee that the film would warrant being purchased in the Classy Velour-bound Boxed Set edition, it needs to have a religious element. Cameo by Jesus? Perfect! Who loves ya, baby? It's a fun film to watch because it's probably a part of the collective backgrounds of a lot of IMDb readers. And, truth be told, it is a better film than either Cleopatra or The Odyssey. However, it pales in comparison in virtually every way to Kubrick's Spartacus.",5,13,33,25 August 2006
Midway," A just ok comic book.
","If you know anything about airplanes, WW2, ships, midway, history, the US navy, the 1940s, Japanese culture, CGI, etc etc this movie will be a letdown.If you have the mentality of an 8-year old looking at a 1950s war comic then this movie will be just great.I'd be willing to bet almost anything that 'subcmdr', the first review that you are likely to see when you looked up midway is a paid shill. He comes up with bogus and who cares faults like 'a few collar devices that weren't pinned on' and ignores the major ones. Moreover, he should know that if he supposedly studied the battle at annapolis '26 years ago', then this was before the release of the parshall and tully book, and therefore wrong. for one, if he claims that midway was 'the pivotal moment changing the course of the pacific war', then he has at best an amateur's view of the battle.all the pilots in the movie behave like college bros born after the turn of the millenium. the japanese are childish caricature.s the CGI is godawful. god awful. videogames have a better akagi than this 'big budget' movie. so much is so very very very, very, very very very wrong with this movie if you care about history or authenticity.but, as a comic book, it's a hoot.",3,2,5,21 January 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A nice movie, if you like this sort of thing. I don't.
","I was nearly beaten to death by my fanboy film-watching mates as I semi-consciously sighed in desperation after what must have been the fourtieth tear jerking 'ending' proved yet again to be a false one and it became evident that I had to endure yet a few more minutes of some imaginary leprechauns babble on about something or other.  Because the cliche store had not been completely emptied by the end of this movie (evil guy:  'no man can kill me!'. (evil guy killed).  killer:  'I am no man!  I am a woman!') during one of the endings a group of smurfs actually literally _sailed off into the sunset_.As others will no doubt have noticed, it was a neat visual fantasyworld that was cooked up.  The battle scenes were neat (although overlong).  However, continuity and 'innumeracy' problems abound that the fanboys are certainly overlooking, but made the film quite annoying for me.  For one, one of the generals carps about having only 6,000 troops.  Then, when he goes to attack, his force must have been at least ten times that, at least according to my amateur crowd-control estimates.  The size of the on-again off-again brilliant/stupid enemy force also seems to change for dramatic needs. Throughout the movie there are obvious dramatic 'shortcuts:'  at least two times, the fat irishman climbs a 100m+ cliff or tower in about one second (or rather, in 1 second worth of screen transition).  During the climactic battle scene, the enemy encircles the vastly outnumbered 'good' force and then waits for no particular reason for what seems like an eternity. There's a lot of this kind of stuff that just doesn't add up.The characters have little depth--for the most part, they are 'good' or 'evil.'  With the exception of one minor character, EVERY good character gets what he or she wants by the end of the movie.  I mean, every stinkin one.This is a fun movie.  It's a good movie.  But not by any stretch of the imagination is it an IMDB '9.0+' movie.  IMDB really has to do something about 'grade inflation' for new movies, especially ones that have inherent appeal to internet-type fanboys.7.0/10 (where '8.0' is about an all-time top-250 movie)",Null,0,0,21 December 2003
Dodgeball," Poor, even by its own low standards
","Dodgeball is not supposed to be high art. Its supposed to be dumb, but funny. Alas, it's mostly just dumb. While there are a few funny moments, I couldn't help thinking throughout the whole thing just how bad the characterizations were. Stiller, arguably the funniest, does a character that is basically a nastier version of his Derek Zoolander character, but far, far less funny. Vince Vaughn basically mopes throughout the whole movie, and for the life of me I can't understand why I should even know his name. The supporting characters should have arguably been the highlight of the movie - funny, memorable, lovable, etc. Instead, they are all barely memorable and scarecely believable hangers on, each actor hoping to coat tails of one of the others' successful characters. Even the pirate is just not funny, and for the life of me, I don't understand how they could have missed with a character like that, but they did. Badly.",3,3,8,5 May 2006
