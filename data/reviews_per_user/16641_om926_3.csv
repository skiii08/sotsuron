Casablanca," Excellent
","I first tried to watch this film a few years ago and shut it off because I thought it was extremely boring and slow. When I saw it in full this time around I must say I regret that it took me this long to finally watch it. Even though its kind of a 'cheesy love story chick flick' I thought it was a great movie. It was fairly simple and easy to understand, whatever action sequences no matter how small were good, the filming was great, there was a good balance of light and dark and finally the characters and acting was phenomenal. Everyone was so good although I do think Humphrey was the best. I was surprised at the end of the movie when Rick didn't get the girl and that he didn't act selfish for once and let her go I really thought they were going to end up together but oh well what can you do maybe that's why some people love this movie so much. 8 stars a must see.",8,1,2,17 November 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Not Bad...
","Prior to seeing this film I heard a lot of hype from people of all ages and I must say I was a little disappointed. I don't know what it was about the film or what it was that I possibly didn't get but I just didn't think it was an amazing movie. However, there were some things that I did particularly enjoy. First of all, I loved the intro scene, the refueling of the plane sequence was awesome. Next, the acting in the film was very good; I mean sitting there watching that scene in the beginning when the guys are all on the plane and some are playing cards, some are looking at playboy, it just seemed so realistic and a great depiction of what soldiers really do. The camera work of the movie was also really good I loved how they used a variety of different shots instead of the same old boring one every time. I also really enjoyed the sound of the film but specifically in the shootout scene towards the end. The comedy wasn't too bad either. Perhaps if I was around in the time it was originally released it would of had a different affect on me.",6,0,3,9 December 2009
Psycho," Eerie
","Right off the bat the viewer is immediately mesmerized and engulfed in the film as it begins with classic, intense Hitchcock music which I really loved. Psycho has great camera-work, fitting music and perfect sound. I specifically like the car scene in the beginning when the camera seemed to be fixed on the hood of the car it just looked awesome. The music always fits the scenes throughout the film however, my favorite was probably the shower scene. There were pretty good effects in the movie as well like the rain scenes for example. I thought Janet Leigh was amazing; everything from her body gestures (for example the movement of her hands when she was originally driving and being followed by a car showing her nervousness) and just her overall sense of panic (when she's at the car dealership and is being watched by the cop). I really enjoyed the sound as well, especially in Marion's car ride after she changes cars and you can hear the voices of people the cop is questioning, etc. The film is incredibly suspenseful especially in the car ride when it starts to rain and she can't see anymore; you're on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen. The shower scene is an absolute classic. It's so real yet at the same time so fake, you never even see her getting stabbed and the lack of blood was a little unrealistic. I felt like the only other two scenes that lacked some realism was the staircase scene, and the fact that there was conveniently a swamp right across the motel for Norman to dispose of cars and bodies. The lighting in the film was also really good with a balance of light and dark scenes. Overall, the movie is pretty good and it has its twists and is a little creepy and scary at times. However, in the end, I honestly don't feel like this movie deserves #22 on the top 250. I think The Shining, even though it was 20 years later, tops this movie in the 'horror scale' but that's just me. Regardless, this is definitely a classic and a great movie.",7,1,2,13 December 2009
