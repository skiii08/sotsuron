Who Framed Roger Rabbit," What can I say?
","by Dane YoussefGee... What can I say?What can be said that hasn't been said a zillion times about this movie before? By film critics, film buffs, the other user posters on IMDb and every other person who saw this one? But you know what? I'm not here to really promote this movie, or analyze it... I'm here to write my love letter for it. We're all here to share our movie-going experiences, aren't we? Well, f*ck it, here's mine.I still remember being a little prepubescent boy sitting in the theater watching this movie, totally amazed and astounded by what I saw. Seeing this wacky cartoons going through a routine Tom-and-Jerry-type episode... and then... it was amazing how these movie actually tricked you, convinced you to believe that human and cartoons can exist in the same universe and dimension of reality. There are many a great pleasures and moments in this movie, one of them is the duet at a 'toon' night club called 'The Ink & Paint Club' where Eddie goes to get information about Roger's wife, and the opening act is a dueling duet on the piano featuring two great legends, Daffy Duck and Donald Duck (I doubt there's any biological relation there) together at last. Why did it take so long for these two to get together? Well, they are rival entertainers for rival studios, so... But of course, the dueling duet ends in an all-out war. Come on, we both know the hatchet wasn't going to stay buried very long.The whole movie is worth renting just to see the two great legends, Daffy and Donald, put their differences aside for one memorable dueling piano duet ALONE. 'Roger Rabbit' pioneered not only animation and film-making style, but acting, writing, directing and a meshing together of different genres. Imagination, luck, brilliance, skill... it's all been blended so perfectly here... just like the animation and live-action.Funny, sharp, satirical, smart, thrilling, skillful, bright, bold, hard-boiled, colorful... at even at times, a little scary.It one three Oscars, not to mention an Honorary Award for it's Technical Advancements. Hell, it deserved every single Oscar it got! And a few it didn't. It should've won every single Oscar that year. Maybe some from others...God, you know, I still remember finding my little Rescue Ranger toy in my pocket and running in back-and-forth through my fingers... I remember being very careful not to loose it as I watched this. And it was hard, damn it, all of what was going up there on the screen.There's the best of the everything here. Everyone should see it, pure and simple. It's a movie... for pretty much everybody. A masterpiece in more ways than one.So help me God, I cannot think of a better actor for the role of the classic, hard-boiled, rock-bottom, not-too-smooth P.I. than Bob Hoskins. I don't think he's ever played a better role in his whole life. He seems to be a strange collision of Sam Spade and W.C. Fields, in some strange way.Christopher Lloyd proves yet again (as he does in all his roles) that he's one of the most underrated actors in the business. He's known for playing the bizarre, the crazy, the wired. But his ability to play villains, particularly more sedate and low-key ones, is overlooked so much, it's grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.Kathleen Turner is damn perfect as Roger's Mrs; especially considering that all she does here is a voice.Roger Rabbit' pioneered not only animation and film-making style, but acting, writing, directing and a meshing together of different genres. Literature purists and scholars (yes, I mean geeks) will note that this movie is adapted from a novel by Gary K. Wolf, who specializes in science-fiction. For those of you who are enamored with this movie and just learning this, are actively considering dropping this review right this instant and running to your nearest library and bookstore to pick up a copy to read as an addition to the movie or just out of curiosity, I should warn you that the movie is completely unfaithful to the novel. Oh, both are clever and well-written spoofs of the whole 'hard-boiled private-detective mystery noir genre,' but the two are so completely different, in writing-style, character dialouge, plot, theme, even ending, you wonder why they even bothered to get Wolf's permission and pay him a royalty. Gee, usually these Hollywood types are a little more snaky and know how to exploit all these loopholes.You've no doubt heard the old saying, 'You can't please everyone, so don't even bother.' Because when you try, you wind up ultimately pleasing no one. Least of all, yourself. It's strange, this movie seems like an exception to that one little rule. I mean, I know there's an exception to every rule, but this is one you're sure is completely iron-clad. This is a movie for everyone. This is a movie that will please everyone. And you know what else? It never got the credit for that. Think about what a big train-wreck this movie could have been. How many things could have gone wrong. How many years Disney and Warner have been at war, all this time, money for a experiment that could have gone worse than than the killer bees and the atomic bomb. And yet, glory be, it didn't. We all live for days like this, filmmakers, film critics... and film lovers. The best part? After it was all over... Roger and Baby Herman went on to star in several of their own cartoon shorts before the movie for real ('Dick Tracy' and 'Honey, I Shrunk The Kids'). Good for them.--In Honor of Roger And His Pals, Dane Youssef",10,5,6,3 March 2004
The Doors," 'a far out trip with the lizard king, but...'
","by Dane Youssef'Ray Manzarek turned down Stone's many requests to help in the movie. Manzarek has since said that the movie is a horrible account of the history of the band.' --FROM IMDb triviaGee, I wish he had participated.Stone's 'The Doors' is a film that loves 'the lizard king's' stage presence. And the poetic and haunting music he left behind.Stone weaves magnificent unworldly music with mind-blowing visuals, joining the sound and look of two worlds together. We see what the inside of Morrison must've really been like.But seems to have little to no interest in who the rest of 'The Doors' really were.There is a moment in this film where Morrison is mugging into the camera, making sexy, seductive smiles, cute little pouts and angry-tiger faces for a photographer. Morrison is a Greek sex god as well as a rock god.The photographer tells him: 'You don't need those guys. YOU'RE the talent. You're the one they want. YOU ARE the doors.'She's not the only one who thinks so. A manager who sees them performing at a club says the same thing, offering Morrison a gig if he drops those 'others.' HE'S THE TALENT, he tells Morrison.Many agree with this, apparently and especially Oliver Stone himself, who focuses ENTIRELY about Morrison at his best (and worst) and makes every sequence is this movie a drugged-out trip into the lizard-king's idol status and pin-up persona.The problem--that's ALL this movie seems to be about.Stone may have misnamed this film 'The Doors.' Perhaps he should have named it 'This Is The End: Life & Fast-Times of Jim Morrison.' Morrison was dead by 27, thanks to all the hard work, talent and success to get him there.Morrison truly is the entire focus of Stone's film, perhaps because he was the true mastermind behind it all. Perhaps Morrison truly was 'The Doors.'The rest of the band's stories--from THEIR point of view. What were they about? The movie seems to be made by someone who loved the music and hated the man. Despised him. By the time Morrison moves on to harder drugs, he has gone from a sensitive soulful poet to a raving and destructive monster.The drugs'll do that, you know.Morrison was actually a sweet, deep, thoughtful and sensitive man. Not to mention very shy and humble. But his art wasn't really much until he started using drugs to fuel his creative fires. Like Hendrix, Cobin, Joplin, the narcotics gave him musical genius and inspiration.Himself, especially. He hurts his girlfriend every way he can, he infuriates the other members of the band, he misses rehearsals and performances (well, actually, sometimes he shows up late). If you've ever seen a backstage band biopic, you know how everything will play out. Passionate, talented kids meet, unique, fresh and with big ideas, the group comes together, they make it big, the seduction of the fame, the money, the power, the sex... and they undo themselves until they're sitting in a pool of their own filth and sick in a state of depression and anger.Well actually, once again, in this case, that's just Morrison. Most of the band just backs him up and just gets angrier and angrier by his steady stream of destruction. He inhales every drug and woman he can and starts to harm everyone who crosses his path, including himself, so he can 'break on through to the other side.' Effective, but I wish Stone had taken the focus off this for just a little while.I would have liked some digging into the rest of the band--the history, the bonding, the feelings there. Who they all were. He doesn't even scratch the surface there.The best of this, I suppose, is when Morrison takes his girlfriend and the band on a peyote-fulled trip out to the desert. They bond over fantasies and nightmares, planning the future---and unraveling. What's going to happen to them?Val Kilmer gives perhaps the best performance of his life. He looks like Morrison, as well as sings just like him (rumor had it the real-life band could not tell the difference between Morrison and Kilmer's vocals). He also prances around the stage with as much perverse, energy, fire and gusto as Morrison ever did. He's larger and bigger than life. He captures all the little things about Morrison, as well as the big ones. He has his soul. He does not impersonate Morrison, he possesses him. Perfectly.But a little of Jim goes a long, long, long way. Stone doesn't seem perturbed and keeps laying it on. I got the wild image of Morrison early on and I would've liked to know more about this poet's soul.'They want my dick, not my words,' he remarks sadly.Other performances are strong, with Kyle MacLachlan as Morrison's truest believer and band-keyboardist ('Twin Peaks' and 'Showgirls'), Frank Whaley as guitarist Robby Krieger ('Swimming with Sharks,' 'Jimmy Show' and 'Homage'), Meg Ryan, Billy Idol and Kevin Dillion. They don't really shine, but then they're all never really allowed to. It's all Kilmer's show as Morrison---like the real 'Doors'?Apparently, the movie seems to think so. By the end of the film, of course, Morrison has died--of course. It plays out not so much like a tragedy as really the best thing for everybody (especially Morrison himself--he's finally achieved his dream).Kilmer's performance, the Door's music and Stone's crazy LSD-eyed view make this movie really worth seeing... it's all like a crazy three-month long trip while The Doors are blasting all the time---Morrison at the center of it all. Still blowing everyone away with this fire...Still, I recommend the film. But be forewarned--this is the life of Jim Morrison... 'Pretty pretentious, Stone.'by Dane Youssef",6,1,4,18 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Does this movie even have a pulse?
","by Dane YoussefUm.... did ANYONE like this movie? Anyone, anywhere... ever? This one seems to be ranking right up there with his 'Howard the Duck.' But at least people had some kind of strong passion for that one. Any extreme movie (exterme in any way) is a likely candidate for the 'cult following.' But this one is just boring.I wanted to kick it as hard as I could, not out of anger, but just to see if it's even alive.If it is, it's flat-lining.I remember when George Lucas announce that he was going to release the last three 'Star Wars' movies (which ironically were the first three), the whole wide world jumped up. When 'Episode I' was finally released, it was met with lukewarm reviews (from critics and fans alike). From the fair-weather to the hard-core, industrial strength fans. And everyone in between.Many people ride Lucas and get on his case about his inability to write dialog (myself included).Hey, let's face it. The man couldn't write dialog for a mime. Which is why he always hires a script doctor whenever he makes a film from his own screenplay. Hey, this is just called just plain common sense.Many filmmakers try to re-make the kinds of movies that they first fell in love with when they were young. That not only applies to Lucas, he is the very definition of that. With futuristic Orwell tales ('THX 1138'), period action-adventure summer matinées ('Indianda Jones'), sci-fi space operas ('Star Wars,' of course) and medieval sword-and-sorcery flicks ('Willow'). His abilities are in composing a movie lie in production values and state-of-the-art, groundbreaking, revolutionary special effects. Bringing everything about a genre together in one film and playing it to the hilt.So Lucas brought on Johnathan Hales ('The Scropian King' and TV's 'Young Indiana Jones Chronicles') as script doctor. Lucas' wise decision helped them take home the 2002 Razzie Award for Worst Screenplay. Hey, f--- the Oscars.This was apparently the very first major-motion picture not to be shot on film, but on a special digital video movie camera that SONY designed specifically for Lucas himself.I saw the movie on DVD, so being shot on digital video and being run on digital video disk, the movie was so sharp and so exact and so precise and so full of detail, I was amazed. When I saw 'Episode I' in theaters, it didn't stand out this beautifully.However, that momentary feeling eventually disintegrated and I was left with a feeling of indifference, then some boredom, then finally contempt.The first released chapter in the 'Star Wars' saga (Episode IV: A New Hope) showed a lot of the movie's themes came from old westerns and samurai pictures. In 'Episode II,' I got the feeling the movie got a lot of it's inspiration from war movies. You know, 'Gettysburg' and the like.The could make for one hell of a little movie, except for the fact that this one is completely on Valium.Breaktaking visual scenery and first-rate FX (the entire movie was filmed in front of a blue screen) can't compensate for performances by actors who understandably seem have to have almost no love for a script that could have been written by a coma patient and a director who's far too assured that 'it'll all be fixed and filled out in editing and special effects later.' I know damned well Hayden Christensen is capable of acting. I've seen it. He seems to be channeling his role from 'Life As A House' (no doubt that's why Lucas chose Christensen in the first place.But the script and lack of direction seem to suck all the potential out of him. He never seems to be truly there at all.Nor does scholar and sometimes-actress Natalie Portman. I feel kinda guilty saying this and all, but I never truly believed her as a action movie heroine in 'Episode I.' She just lacks that spunk and fire. You know, the kind that Carrie Fisher really had for almost every second she was on screen, especially when she shared scenes with Ford.Portman simply can't do a Bidget Fonda or Pam Grier or Karen Allen. She's too sweet and vulnerable. Well, at least she seems more at home here. Although as sweet and beautiful as she is, there is no passion. Not in what she says or anything they do together.They never seem to be in love so much as just sitting back practicing Shakesphere-style acting and mood for a theater performance.It's nice to know good IL' Bobby Simone, yes--Jimmy Smits (Of TV's 'L.A. Law' and NYPD Blue' fame) is still out there and plugging away as an actor. He gets a bit in here as a Jedi Master on the council.The only action sequences of any interest throughout take place when a Sith and Jedi masters have a powerful duel which leads to further hate and anger.The dark side is claiming more and more Jedi by the second. And all this could've great for another great 'Star Wars' classics. But the movie is has no life or energy. It seems almost indifferent. Like Lucas didn't have his heart (or anything else in this one).He basically just wanted to get this one out of the way. The only thing he had in this movie is his wallet.This whole damn movie feels like something he had to just something mandatory he had to get out of the way so he could bridge episodes I and III and continue with the rest of the series.With the others, you know the filmmakers are giving it everything they had. Here... no one cares. Not even Lucas.--For Force And Empire, Dane Youssef",2,18,33,25 August 2005
Rocky IV," Popular, successful... but just doesn't stand the test of time
","by Dane YoussefOf all of Sylvester Stallone's chapters of the 300+ volumes of the 'Rocky' saga, 'Rocky IV' is often referred to as the silliest, most soul-bereft... and altogether WORST of the saga. Whearas, I have actually read posts from many (most on this site here) who renown this four-time Razzie-'winning' champion of 1985 as a defecation of everything that made the 1976 original the classic it was, is and will continue to be as long as mankind roams on this rock third from the sun.But yes, while 'Rocky IV' is a film that is often cited as the worst of the whole 'Rocky' franchise. Is it? Many people despise 'Rocky V' more. Dolph Lundgren is in real life a genius and a first-degree black-belt. Not a mention a wooden actor. More so than Stallone. The two have great chemistry and an arguably incredible (and ludicrous) showdown. But is this film too little too late.You be the judge. Let's take a good look at the + and the - at this movie.PRO: Stallone throws together a boxing-training montage that is without a doubt, the best Iv'e ever seen. Rocky shows heart and soul and Drago is more machine than man. After it's over, you're ready to train to the big fight yourself! The fight sequences are nothing short of riveting, between both boxers. It's grueling. There's tension pumping in all directions. You'd need a Ginsu to cut it. More action-packed than really dramatic. CONS: Um... just about everything else. Especially the final shot--the freeze-frame of the Itallion Stallion being draped proudly with the American flag.But then again, let's not nitpick. A movie is supposed to be simply enjoyed, not estimated. 'Rocky IV' is not a bad film, it's just not necessary. It's not really worth the effort. None of these films are truly awful. Maybe Stallone should've just hung up the Championship belt after clubbing Clubber Lang (Mr. T). But then again, who could blame him? Stallone put so much into 'Rocky' that people simply won't accept Stallone as anything else. He is not the most versatile record and he has the movies (and Razzies to prove it) to prove it. Stallone himself said no role fit him better. He designed the script so no one could play it as well as he could. It was his big break. People loved the Itallion Stallon, so Stallone kept cranking them out.But whereas the first two 'Rocky' movies were heartfelt dramas about people and their dreams, desires and abilities, over time the saga turned into over-inflated summer testosterone-driven action-movies.Maybe because that's what Stallone himself was venturing into. The man was built for action. In other genres like drama, he's made undeniable marks with 'Rocky' and 'Cop Land' (though nothing else). And his contributions to comedy are laughable. Wait, that came out wrong... The strange birthday party for Paulie had me looking in disbelief. Apparently he's spent so much time drinking and mooching off his brother in law, he's made no friends and Rocky and his family buy Paulie an actual robot. The robot serves as a servant, even a friend... and perhaps a lover? Hee-hee-hee-hee. Yeeesh. I got the creeps... actually, that's being charitable. I felt unclean. As if I had just been 'violated,' I guess, is as good a word as any.The exhibition where Apollo Creed prepares to break out of retirement to battle the 6'4' Ivan Drago from Russia has an opening act of James Brown and an endless stream of Vegas musicians, showgirls all performing a loud, tacky and ugly rendition of 'Living In America.' The whole James Brown opening number is so ludicrously hideous, that you have to wonder if the whole inspiration came from the opening musical number to 'Springtime For Hitler' from 'The Producers.' Was Stallone attempting to show how shameless America takes itself (even back then)?Hey, if he was... nice piece of satire, Sly.God help us all... and him if he wasn't.Of course, even as shameless as all this... is the big end where he wraps himself in the American flag.While Stallone does not have a great range as an actor, he has tailor-made roles that have allowed him to do what he does best and put asses in seats and gross big ('Rocky,' 'Cliffhanger' and 'Rambo'), probably because he knows his range better than anyone. My relief is that 'Rocky' is over now and Stallone is currently working on another script which he has written for himself (as well as direct) and since he knows his abilities, it'll truly be something to watch.I'll buy a ticket. Won't you?",3,1,4,25 October 2004
Detroit Rock City," Full of timeless nostalgia. Precious adolescent memories.
","by Dane YoussefNow here is a film that is designed to preach to the choir. Well, not so much preach as praise. 'Detroit Rock City' is a movie that plays out like a throwback to those wonderful days when... you and your friends lived on a steady diet of junk food, teenage smarmy... and great music. You and your buds had your own band (in the garage, the basement or the backyard) and you had a dream that someday, you'd be up there rocking and rolling for a living.. just like the very bands you worshiped religiously. Some of you made it come true. Made it to that side. Got to live out your dream and was paid the same worship you gave your elders. Most of the others just grew up, and... well...That's a lot of what 'Detroit Rock City' is about. Thankfully, it's really not one of those 'topical' movies that just showcase a flavor-of-the-month band in a starring role like 'Spice World,' 'Cool As Ice' or 'Crossroads.' Films like those feel so passé' and ancient in a week or so. When people go to those movies, afterwords, they just ask themselves, 'What was I thinking? God, so dorky! So lame! So embarrassing! Eyecch!' He's just like me... they're just like my buds. They sound and think just like us... Jeez... some things are timeless.The cast is first-rate. The look and sound is so flawless, it's... And the music is all there. Director Adam Rifkin gives this an MTV-music video style of cinematography. And Carl V. Dupre' writes like he's about the age of the boys himself. It's almost like one of our heroes wrote it. Well, in a way, maybe they did.'Write what you know. Tell your own personal story.' --- Old Writing rule The screenplay is the very definition of originality: entirely composed of stolen elements from countless other movies--'American Graffitti,' 'I Want To Hold Your Hand,' 'That '70's Show,' 'Clerks,' 'The Full Monty,' 'Footloose,' 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand,' 'Dazed and Confused' and probably a lot of others. And the character of Trip is obviously lifted from the Kevin Smith movies. Of course, let's face it---there's nothing new under the sun and most filmmakers (at least 9 out of 10, anyway) are making movies just like the ones they grew up with. The movies that made them not only want to be filmmakers, but even before that---made them film lovers.The scene-stealer's in the film are Sam Huntington as the sweet-natured, weak-willed, yet most lovable of the whole bunch, Jereimiah 'Jam' Bruce and Linda Shaye as his God-fearing, bible-thumping, holier-than-Jesus mother. The usually reliable Edward Furlong isn't nearly as good, and his role is much more on-par with that of the forgettable 'Pecker,' rather than the stand-out performance 'T2.' James DeBello is a lot of fun as Trip, but not quite Jay from the Kevin Smith films (which kinda feels like that's what they were going for). And newcomer Giuseppe Andrews unfortunately gives the weakest performance as the pessimistic worry wort Lex. Porno legend Ron Jeremy himself appears here is an amusing cameo as the disco club MC. And Former Playboy Playmate Shannon Tweed has a thin and underdone role as the older woman 'Mrs. Robinson' who picks Hawk up at a bar. The type of role she plays in the movie is nothing new for her (and certainly not very interesting), but the original scene (which was cut for length) had a lot more to it, and it really shouldn't have been trimmed out. The boys (and the cast) feels realistic and genuine. Like the cast of 'That '70's Show,' they're not just wearing the vintage clothes and hairstyles. They genuinely seem to embody the era. The actors, the clothes, the cars, the music, the lingo, the spirit... this is a movie than genuinely feels authentic. Although, it's not quite flawless, as precious few movies are (People aren't perfect, life isn't perfect. So why would movies be?) The direction is a bit too much a lot of the time. A little goes a long way, and it seems like Rifkin is indulging himself with fancy camera tricks. And it borderlines on motion-sickness and migraine-inducing at times. And Dupre's screenplay has a lot of trite', warmed-over and and pedestrian comic material, and kind-of-a cobbled together plot that never feels like it's coming from it's source. The characters are great, and so are most of their lines, as well as some of their moments... There's a great bit where Trip conjures up a hair-brained (at best) scheme to snake a KISS ticket and gets himself in the worst possible scenario. It's fun watching him try to dig his way out. This album deserves to go quadruple-platinum and sell more copies than anything Michael Jackson or the Beatles ever did. It's a must-have for anyone who remembers the era fondly or just loves the music. It's retro-cool. The only real problem, as I see it, which kept 'DRC' from being a classic in the tradition of 'Animal House' or 'Rock 'N' Roll High School' is that... well, it's never really sends up the decade or that age very much. Nor does it to that for any of it's targets (cruel teachers/parents, disco-fans, over-zealous, Bible-thumping Christians, and any other authority figure). It really could have used some of that period-lacerating satire that 'The Simpsons' or 'That '70's Show' does so well. But it's more of a love letter to a time of innocence and wonder. Which isn't all bad, but some more name dropping (and name calling towards that long lost decade) would have made all the difference for the better in the world.Isn't that always the way? Well, as it should be.--For Rock 'N' Roll (meaning KISS) Forever, Dane Youssef",7,1,3,21 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Just when we've all dismissed Lucas as a sell-out and a business-man... he reminds us what he stands for in the movie business.
","by Dane YoussefIt's all over. The saga is complete. Lucas has come full-circle and so has the universe and it's inhabitants. After episodes I and II, Lucas had been accused to selling out on his creation and one of the greatest serial-movies of all time. He had lost the way. Lost his voice. He'd become the worst thing an artist can be... a businessman. With all the technology and control in the world... he had become lazy. At times, the movie feels unnatural and at times, I would call this one of the best thing Lucas has ever done. But this is truly a movie not to be missed. Ever since I was a little boy, when I first saw Darth Vader, I asked myself, 'Is he supposed to be a robot? An alien? Why does he wear that strange suit? Probably just to make him look scary.' For those who've all wondered the same, Episode III answers that and a lot of others. And you will never look at 'Star Wars' the same way again. 'Sith' is more of an opera than a fairy tale. There is a sad aura of inevitable doom and gloom in nearly every scene. Even in what would be the most upbeat and cheerful scenes, there's a reason for sorrow rather than celebration. 'Episode III' contains a dark interior lining in every silver cloud. George Lucas seems to be trying to make amends for his later and lesser films, and I for one, think he succeeds wholly here.Lucas runs the gamut totally here and shows the world (just like he did in 'THX 1138' and 'American Graffiti') that he is a force to reckoned with, even feared. The force is not merely with him, he is controlling it here.Of course, throughout his whole career and even now, poor Georgie boy has never been able to write so much as a line of realistic dialouge.I don't like to give things away in movies, but really, what's to give away? EVERYONE who has seen 'Star Wars' and anyone who's seen any of the first three released chapters knows EVERYTHING COMING. We know that Anikan will convert to the dark side and become Darth Vader. We know that the traitor in the midst is Chancellor Palpatine, who will become the Emperor. Padme will bore Luke and Leia. Even in Episode IV, Darth Vader tells us how a showdown between him and Obi-Wan turns out.But to see how it all came to be is just plain shocking and even a little disturbing. There is such cruelty and sadness in this chapter. Haven't we all grown up laughing and smiling and looking to 'Star Wars' for fun and upbeat cheer? 'Star Wars' has always stood for escapist fantasy. His movies are about visual worlds and dreams, not sparkling conversation. Lucas pretty much does it all here, so he exposes all his talents and faults clearly. But he is truly a dreamer. Perhaps Lucas wanted to do it all so he could see (and the whole world could as well) just how good he truly is and what good he's at.I truly believe that if Lucas wasn't a filmmaker, Lucas would be that older guy sitting around the campfire telling stories. Old, long forgotten legends of ancient lore and spinning some new ones. Lucas is an homage-payer in his movies. The battles are so amazing, we can forgive everything Lucas has done wrong so far. He creates beautiful galaxies and worlds, especially the planet Mustafar. Another moment comes in a showdown between one of the great Jedi masters and the great Sith masters. Perhaps one of the problems was Lucas has all but done away completely with sets. All of his movies since 1999 are filmed in front of green-screens (or are they called 'green-rooms'? I forget). You can finally see why Lucas has abandoned real sets, Muppet's and locations in favor on green-screens. Finally, after all this time... you've never seen a movie like this! The first-class FX are all seamless. I know that this is all a movie... all actors, sets and props... but Lucas made me forget. Christensen and Portman feel more natural here than they did in 'Clones.' Probably because their flat, clunky lines (courtesy of Lucas himself) doesn't go on nearly as long. When Padme' tells Anikan she is pregnant from what they've been doing together (see 'Episode II.' Or rather DON'T), Anikan seems like this'll get in the way of his becoming a true Jedi knight. Lucas has problems directing dramatic scenes and even more writing them. As for his love scenes, Good Lord.... But a moment where Padme' expresses her pain at where Anikan is headed and we see his....The ending is so sad, so heartbreaking. We have to remember that this is only Episode III of VI. The average American household (or any other country in the world) has Episodes IV-VI waiting for them at home. After Episode III, IV would be good to wash away this downbeat feeling. 'Star Wars' has always been a hallmark of childhood fantasy, but in this entry, everyone does a lot of growing-up. You'd think all this reality and contemporary sadness would ruin the memory.But no. It doesn't ruin 'Star Wars.' As a matter of fact, it deepens it. This is a movie that needs to be seen by every 'Star Wars' fan. This is a movie that needs to be seen by every movie fan. This is a movie that needs to be seen by everyone.See it now.--May 'Star Wars' Never End, Dane Youssef",9,4,7,3 September 2005
