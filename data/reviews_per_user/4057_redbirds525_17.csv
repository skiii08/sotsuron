Catch Me If You Can," One of Spielberg and Hanks' best!!
","First off, I must preface by saying I am not a fan of Leonardo DeCaprio. I had to suffer through him in TITANIC (a movie which I enjoyed), GANGS OF NEW YORK (which I hated) and now CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.I first saw CATCH ME IF YOU CAN in the theatre last Christmas and thought it was an okay movie. Nothing spectacular. I rented the DVD when it first came out and watched it three times within the week that I had the DVD for. This has since become one of my favorite films in recent memory. I have been turned off recently by some bad Speilberg films, in my opinion (AI, MINORITY REPORT.) But the combination of Speilberg, Tom Hanks and even Leonardo made this a very entertaining movie to watch.This movie actually reminded me of THE FUGITIVE, with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. It always seemed the crook was one step ahead of the authority figure. Tom Hanks is great as Carl Handratty, the FBI agent hot on the trail of Frank Abagnale (DeCaprio.) The always wonderful Christopher Walken plays Frank's dad and gives a brilliant performance well worthy of the Oscar nomination. This is really a great movie to see. One of my favorite parts was at the end where they are playing the classic Nat King Cole 'The Christmas Song' during one of the climaxes. I would recommend CATCH ME IF YOU CAN to everyone, even those who are not Leonardo DeCaprio fans.Rating: 9 out of 10",9,0,1,17 June 2003
The Ring," THE BEST COMEDY OF 2002!
","One of the greatest comedies of 2002! A must see! If you want to have a comedy night at your home, rent this and SIGNS. You will never laugh so hard in your life. If you were scared by this movie (or Signs for that matter), you should really seek help and not watch REAL horror movies, like THE EXORCIST. But seriously folks, this is a bad movie. I've only walked out of one movie in my life: FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS. I was ready to walk out of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, but it mercifully ended. I was ready to walk out of THE RING as well, but it also mercifully ended. Don't waste your time on this. It is a waste of time and money, unless you want to laugh very hard.",1,1,4,16 June 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great piece of filmmaking!!!!
","I first saw this movie when I was seven years old. I went to a friends birthday party and we all went to see it. As a seven year old kid, this movie scared the hell out of me!! Especially the snakes and spiders and the Nazis melting away. I had a glutton for punishment, especially since I begged my dad in 1979 to take me to see ALIEN because I thought it would be like STAR WARS. I was wrong and wound up sleeping in my parents bed for about four weeks. This was a good filler movie to keep me occupied for the three LONG years between THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI. I remember my dad got this movie for us on Beta and we would watch it all the time. This movie brings back a lot of childhood memories for me, as does the STAR WARS trilogy. Looking back now, some 22 years later, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK remains one of my top 10 favorite films, just as Harrison Ford remains one of my favorite actors. This movie is brilliantly casted, with great writing and action and adventure all along the way. I am very excited to hear the box set is coming out on DVD(right before my birthday no less!)Now if only George Lucas would follow suit and release the original STAR WARS trilogy!!!",9,0,1,16 June 2003
Training Day," A brilliant piece of work!
","This is one of the most incredible films I've seen in a long time. Denzel Washington made this movie as great as it was. There is not another actor you could have cast in the role of Alonzo. He really stole the show with this film.The thing that is so great about this movie is that you've never seen Denzel Washington play a bad guy. And he does it so damn well!! Ethan Hawke is just as good as the rookie cop Jake Hoyt. But I've unfortunately seen too many bad Ethan Hawke movies (BEFORE SUNRISE, GATTICA)to turn me sour. Cliff Curtis is great in this as well as a gang leader with a heart. IF you want to see another great Cliff Curtis performance, check out BRINGING OUT THE DEAD. The supporting cast is great in this as well. Eva Mendez from 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS is Denzel's wife (hottie), Dr. Dre and the guy that played Redfoot in THE USUAL SUSPECTS are members of Alonzo's unit. Denzel Washington's performance is top-notch. And I don't even think this was his greatest performance. Denzel was superb in REMEMBER THE TITANS and in the Oscar-snubbed THE HURRICANE. I feel the Academy gave the Oscar to Denzel because they know they screwed him twice for REMEMBER THE TITANS (where he was robbed of the best actor award) and THE HURRICANE. Nonetheless, this is still a great crime drama and it's not to be missed.Rating: 9 out of 10.",9,0,11,16 June 2003
Alien: Resurrection," Why bother??
",The trailer for 'ALIEN 3' says 'on Earth..everyone can hear you scream.' Wasn't that supposed to be the premise for 'ALIEN 4?'This is just a bad movie; poorly written. The ALIEN saga should have been put to bed after Ripley dies in the third movie. Winona Rider did nothing for me in this movie. Not worth it. Save your money and rent 'THE THING.' ONE STAR out of four.,2,0,1,15 May 2003
Alien," RIDLEY SCOTT AT HIS BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","In 1979, I was four years old. I had just seen STAR WARS for the first time and was amazed. I remember my neighbor had a sleepover birthday party for my friend Chris in the fall of 1980 and we were all fascinated by space movies (BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, BUCK RODGERS) ESPECIALLY after just seeing THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. This kid's mother was not the brightest bulb in the bunch. She rented some space sci-fi movies for us, one of them was ALIEN.
We all know what happened at the dinner table scene with Kane. When that part happened, the crying began and the Beta tape was taken out of the tape player by the mom.I actually finished watching ALIEN around 1988 or so. Even as a 14-year old kid who was starting to love horror movies, ALIEN still freaked me out. Ironically enough, I was still hanging out with my friend Chris at the time and we watched ALIEN and HALLOWEEN for the first time.ALIEN is a classic Sci-Fi/Horror film with an outstanding cast. Tom Skerrit is Dallas, the ship commander. Yapphet Kotto redeems himself from playing a TERRIBLE villian in the Bond film LIVE AND LET DIE, as the tough guy Parker. Ian 'Bilbo Baggins' Holm is Ash, the science offer with ulterior motives. Rounding out the cast is John Hurt, Veronica Cartwright and of course, Sigourney Weaver.The movie begins when the commercial towing vessel, the NOSTROMO, is ordered by The Company to explore a transmission of unknown origin on a deserted planet. Without giving anything away, an alien gets on board the ship and wreaks havoc on the crew.Like BLADE RUNNER, this is literally a dark movie. Most of it takes place on a dark spaceship and you don't know what is lurking around the corner. This adds to the scariness of the film. I have watched this so many times that I'm immune to it freaking me out now. Unfortunately, the sequels were not as good, in my opinion (I know everyone argues that ALIENS was superior.)This movie is Ridley Scott's best work and BLADE RUNNER follows a very close second.",9,1,3,5 August 2003
Radio," Superb!
","There is a drive-in by my house that I frequent a lot. Tonight I had the great pleasure of seeing two outstanding films that will probably not be nominated for Best Picture. The first film was RADIO, the second was KILL BILL.I was shocked at how much negative press this film got. Cuba Gooding Jr. was outstanding! This man has had some great roles in his career from BOYZ IN THE HOOD to JERRY MAGUIRE and now RADIO. If there was any justice, Cuba would be nominated for Best Actor for this film. They gave it to Denzel a few years ago for TRAINING DAY to make up screwing him out of THE HURRICANE and REMEMBER THE TITANS. They can nominate Cuba.This was a very touching and warm-hearted movie. For the first time in a long while, I cried on several occasions. A very powerful film with a great performance by Ed Harris as well as the high school football coach. Alfre Woodward was equally great as the principal. You get to see how Radio goes from a shy outsider to a beloved figure at the school. This is truly an outstanding film and hopefully should receive a Best Picture nomination.",Null,0,0,15 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," 2003 - the year of GOOD 'Third' Movies!
","2003 has been a strange movie year. Usually, you don't see a good third movie. Of course there are exceptions..ie RETURN OF THE JEDI, AUSTIN POWERS 3 and one of my favorites SUPERMAN III. But then you get your bombs as well..GODFATHER III (I refuse to acknowledge this movie exists), JAWS 3D, HALLOWEEN 3, etc. In 2003, there were several very good third movies -- AMERICAN PIE 3, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, TERMINATOR 3 and in December, LORD OF THE RINGS 3.When I first heard TERMINATOR 3 was being made, I was skeptical. No Jim Cameron, no Linda Hamilton, an unknown actor playing John Connor. TERMINATOR 3 was a pleasant surprise and I would rank it as one of the top films of 2003. Granted Arnie isn't the Arnie of 10-15 years ago, but he still proves to be a top-notch action star. Nick Stahl is superb taking over for Eddie Furlong as John Connor. There are some pretty decent action sequences in here (truck chase, cemetary shootout, etc) but the humor is severely lacking from T2.
The ending is a shock. You will never see it coming in a million years. But it does leave the door wide open for a TERMINATOR 4. Let's hope...but let's bring Cameron back for that one!",Null,0,0,15 November 2003
The Shining," ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES EVER MADE!!!
","I first became intrigued with Stephen King around 1989. The first book I read was PET SEMATARY, which was a great book, but a horrible movie. Then I read THE SHINING and I was scared out of my wits. As most SK fans know, his books translate into horrid movies for the most part (can anyone say DREAMCATCHER?) The problem is they become so twisted they stray away from the original plot. THE SHINING, the book and THE SHINING, the movie are two totally different things. Two entirely different endings. THE SHINING is the only SK book and movie that I enjoyed together, even though they are totally different. THE SHINING is a horror film that will frighten you out of your wits. Jack Nicholson shines (no pun intended) in his role of Jack Torrance, the caretaker of the beautiful Overlook Hotel. This is not a bloody movie, there are only a selected few scenes of gore. This movie screws with your mind as you watch Jack slowly go insane.For horror fans, this is a movie that cannot be missed. If you want to be scared, watch this movie and THE EXORCIST. Forget this rubbish BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and the truly awful THE RING. These movies are classic horror movies and should not be missed.",10,0,1,17 June 2003
Aliens," I liked it, but I still like ALIEN better
","I may be in the minority, but I thought ALIEN was a better movie.ALIEN was much more scary in my opinion, but ALIENS has much more action. James Cameron was the perfect man to direct this film. This is probably the 2nd best Cameron film (I liked T2 more.) I know a lot of people loved this film better than the first ALIEN movie. This is definitely a very entertaining film to watch. The special effects are outstanding and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. Plus Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton are in it, added bonuses.Unfortunately, this was the last good ALIEN film and it should have ended there. Alien 3 was okay, but ALien Resurrection was horrid.",Null,0,0,15 November 2003
Pearl Harbor," ARE WE SURE THIS ISN'T A MICHAEL MANN FILM?
","Michael Mann's 'Heat' (1996) and 'Ali' (2001) were both 3 hour movies that could have been told in an hour and a half. They were also both filled with useless subplots that I could care less about.James Cameron's masterpiece 'Titanic' (1997) was a 3 hour movie that was absolutely wonderful, from the story all the way to the special effects.Like 'Titanic', we knew what the outcome of 'Pearl Harbor' was before the film began. Like 'Titanic', 'Pearl Harbor' was about a love story in a time of tragedy. Like 'Titanic', 'Pearl Harbor' gives us a good 90 minutes of great special effects that are breathtaking. UNLIKE 'Titanic', 'Pearl Harbor' is a three hour movie that could have been started 90 minutes into the film and you wouldn't miss a thing. UNLIKE 'Titanic', the romantic story in 'Pearl Harbor' is HORRIBLY WRITTEN!! My goodness!! Talk about cheesy!!Like 'Star Wars: Episode II' (2002), 'Pearl Harbor' drags endlessly for an hour and a half until you hit the final battle. In 'Star Wars: Episode II', the final battle makes up for the rest of the film being so bland. NOT 'Pearl Harbor', though. There were three good things about 'Pearl Harbor':1. Kate Beckinsale - HORRID fake American accent, but she's nice eye candy.2. Cuba Gooding Jr - another stellar performance!3. Jon Voight - WOW!!! This guy is an incredible actor, this time potraying President Franklin D. Roosevelt.All the goods don't make up for all the bads. Skip this one and watch a GOOD war film, 'Saving Private Ryan.'",Null,0,1,7 August 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," QT redeems himself after the horrid JACKIE BROWN
","After witnessing a brutal third film by Quentin Tarantino (JACKIE BROWN), I went into KILL BILL with little expectations. Due to the fact that QT made two brilliant films to start his career, I was so psyched up for JACKIE BROWN. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. Even great actors like Samuel L. Jackson and Robert DeNiro couldn't save it. I also questioned why Miramax would spilt KILL BILL into two parts instead of making one film. Well folks, my father always said money talks and bulls**t walks.QT is back in full force, directing a film that is right up there with RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION. The film opens with a quote from STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN that says `Revenge is a dish that is best served cold.' Revenge is the main theme in this movie, just as honor is one of the central themes in RESERVOIR DOGS and redemption is the main theme of PULP FICTION. Basic synopsis (MINOR SPOLIERS) --- the Bride (Uma Thurman looking hotter than ever) is left for dead on her wedding day. We don't see the full attack take place, just bits and pieces. She awakes from a four year coma and vows revenge on her attackers. Just to warn everyone, this is one of the most goriest movies I have ever seen in a long time. If you can't stand the sight of blood squirting and dismemberment, this may not be the movie for you. Limbs and heads are disappearing faster than food on a plate of a person that hasn't eaten for days.  Multiple deaths in this one, compared to very few in PULP FICTION. The scene where Uma fights all of Lucy Liu's army is one of the best action sequences I've seen since Keanau Reeves fought the Smith clones in THE MATRIX RELOADED. With KILL BILL, Quentin Tarantino again proves what a skilled and gifted writer he is. It leaves with a startling revelation at the end, making us wait until February 2004 to see what goes down. I noticed quite a lot of PULP FICTION references in this one. When Uma draws the square in the air, I laughed. Unfortunately, my girlfriend has never seen PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS. She did enjoy this movie though, just as I did. Welcome back, Quentin. You just made one hell of a film, right up to the level with the two masterpieces you started your directoral career with. * * * * stars (out of 4)",Null,0,1,15 November 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," HEY MR. LUCAS--THIS IS HOW TO WRITE A LOVE STORY IN AN ACTION MOVIE..
","Mr. Lucas,Please take some time away from writing what is probably going to be the bad STAR WARS EPISODE III, plop down nine bucks and treat yourself to an incredible film, 'THE MATRIX RELOADED.'Don't get me wrong--I am (bordering on 'was') a HUGE Star Wars fan. But you've given us such crap the last four years. Bring in two relatively UNKNOWN filmmakers (Larry and Andy Wachowski) and they have put together two of the greatest Sci-Fi films I've ever seen.Take a look at the writing of the love story between Neo and Trinity in this movie--it was great! No cheesy dialouge like in STAR WARS 'Start your DVD Player at the 1 hr 49 min mark and that's where the movie starts' EPISODE II.Thank you for your time.Mike T. Chicago, ILPeople..THE MATRIX RELOADED is one of the best Sci-Fi films I've ever seen. I'm not a huge fan of the MATRIX movies; I've only seen the first one a few times. I know I'm going back to the theatre to see RELOADED again and again. This is one of the best movies of the summer and should rival Terminator 3 for biggest grossing movie of the summer.

Bruce Almighty," A surprisingly funny movie!
","When I first saw the trailer for 'Bruce Almighty,' I thought it was going to fall into the category of 'Corky Romano' or 'A Night At The Roxbury.' You know, those movies where the trailers reveal the only funny parts in the movie. I was pleasantly surprised with 'Bruce Almighty.' I don't think I've laughed so hard in a long time.Jim Carrey is teriffic as Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck Buffalo lighter side of the news reporter trying desperately to get an anchor's job. I also enjoyed the performance of Jennifer Aniston in this film as Bruce's girlfriend, Grace. Aniston has proven with this, last year's 'The Good Girl' and the funny 'Office Space' that she has nicely evolved from TV to the big screen.  Morgan Freeman is PERFECT in this movie as God. I don't think they could have found anyone else to play that role to a T like Freeman did.
This movie is a lot more than just a series of gags. There is a well written story behind the gags and it keeps you interested. But the gags in this movie are EXTREMELY FUNNY, especially for a PG-13 movie. The part with the monkey almost had me falling out of my seat in laughter.I would highly recommend 'Bruce Almighty.' They even threw an 'Ace Ventura' joke in there that, surprisingly, only a few people in the theater I was in caught. This is a fun comedy to see if you're in need of a good laugh. Carrey's best work since 'Me Myself and Irene.' I give 'Bruce Almighty' * * * 1/2 stars.",8,0,1,24 May 2003
Signs," BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD..oh, did I mention bad?
","Absolutely one of the worst movies of 2002. You should burn in hell before dropping three bucks to rent crap like this.SPOILER...Okay, the aliens land in the rain forest and water is supposed to hurt them??? What the hell are they doing in the damned rain forest then???Horribly written, horribly acted..and when the hell are catholic priests supposed to have wives???I can't believe people thought this was scary????!! Are you kidding me????!?!??!M. Night is slipping. Sixth Sense-awesome. Unbreakable-not as awesome, but good. Signs-BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD and BAD!!If you want to have a comedy night at your home, rent SIGNS and the equally bad THE RING. You'll never laugh so hard, guaranteed! I acutally saw someone in line at Best Buy buying this and The Ring and I turned to my wife and said, 'this guy's gonna have a comedy night at his house.'",1,1,2,9 March 2003
Casino," SCORCESE AT HIS FINEST HOUR!
","I have never been a Martin Scorcese fan. I did not like TAXI DRIVER. Even as much as I love mob films, I didn't care all that much for GOODFELLAS. Back in 1995, I wrote movie reviews for my college paper. One of the movies I had to see was CASINO. My first thought was, 'oh damn, I have to sit through a 3-hour Scorcese movie.' It is strange because I didn't like GOODFELLAS, but I love DeNiro and Pesci. In CASINO, DeNiro and Pesci made the movie as great as it was.Robert DeNiro is Ace Rothstein, who is an expert gambler. He is asked by the Midwest Mob to take control of the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. He immediately cleans up the casino of crooks (in one scene, a man who is caught cheating has his hand beat with a hammer) and brings in a lot of money for the bosses. During this time, Ace meets Ginger (Sharon Stone), who is one of the most notorious hustlers in Vegas. He falls in love with her and they marry, even though she is still faithful to her ex-pimp Lester Diamond (James Woods.) Nicky Santoro (Pesci) is called in by the Mob to protect Ace and make sure no one messes with the casino. All is well for a while until Nicky begins causing trouble and that's when all hell breaks loose.This movie is almost three hours long, but the time flies right by. The supporting cast is top notch. If you are a fan of mob films, you can't miss CASINO.Rating: 9 out of 10",9,2,3,17 June 2003
True Romance," I haven't killed anybody...since 1984
","This is one of the best Quentin Tarantino film that he did not direct. It has the charisma and violence of RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION. Even if you're not a Christian Slater fan (I'm not), you will still like this movie. This is a very well written piece of work by Quentin Tarantino. The chemistry between Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater is top notch. Gary Oldman is brilliant as usual in his role as a pimp. Brad Pitt is equally brilliant in one of his first roles as a stoner dude. And the #1 reason to see this film. Christopher Walken plays a mob boss. He is on screen for about 10 minutes. He has one of the best dialouges with Dennis Hopper that I have ever seen in film history. This movie is worth seeing just for the 10 minutes Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper are on screen together.If you like the other QT movies (PULP FICTION and RESERVOIR DOGS), you will absolutely love this film. Tony Scott (DAYS OF THUNDER, TOP GUN, THE FAN) pulls all the shots out behind the camera. I would recommend the Special Edition DVD, which has the very bizarre alternate ending.Rating: 8 out of 10",8,0,1,16 June 2003
