Requiem for a Dream," Darren's got juice
","In the corner of the cozy living room, a seventeen-year-old boy buries his face in his jacket rather than look at the screen. 'Oh my God,' a sixteen-year-old girl whimpers. Another stares at the screen, paralyzed, unable even to blink. And a fifteen-year-old girl weeps openly, but only some of it is the horror she feels right now. She's just had an epiphany. 'I want to be a filmmaker,' she thinks.This is what happened when a group of friends and I watched Darren Aronofsky's film 'Requiem for a Dream' - fifteen minutes after the film had ended.I've seen a lot of movies, ranging from incredible to despicable. I've laughed, I've cried, and I've raised my eyebrows. I've come very close to tossing my cookies, mostly at blood-and-guts fests like 'The Passion of the Christ.' This was the first time I ever came out of a movie just wishing I was dead, and, at the same time, thanking my lucky stars that I was alive. There has never been and I don't think there ever will be a movie as shocking, terrifying, and inspiring as this one.Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a lonely old widow who desperately wants and needs something or someone to care about. Her son, Harry (Jared Leto) is a lost, confused kid - a bit of a sleazebag, but he seems to have a good heart. His girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connolly) is a bright, ambitious young woman who is experiencing real love for the first time. And their best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans - speaking of shocks) is a street-wise tough guy who misses his mother and wants to be loved. In spite of this, they are all happy - or rather, they think they are. Sara's just gotten a call informing her that she's going to be on television, and in a desperate effort to lose weight for the event she begins taking powerful prescription pills. And she's not lying to you - this is the best she has felt in years. Harry, Marion, and Tyrone are running a successful heroin-and-cocaine traffic, and in between all of the sex, shoots, and buying Harry's mom a new TV set, life is pretty darn good. You and I could live happily in a world like that if we were made to.Except that, of course, it can't stay like that. The chills begin to travel with greater and greater frequency down the spine as the lives of each of these four individuals are shattered. Each of them is reduced to a mindless void of addiction. That's what this film is about - addiction. Addiction does terrible, terrible things to good people, and Darren Aronofsky and Hubert Selby Jr. know it.The film is a must-see for any actor. The performances of Leto, Connolly, and (in a pleasant surprise) Wayans dovetail perfectly with each other, and viewers will be drawn to the humanity and honesty that each of them throws into their character. But - it's already been sung, and it can't be said enough - Ellen Burstyn stole the show and has no plans to return it any time soon. The sight of Sara running wildly down the street, emaciated and babbling, will tear your heart from her chest. Combine that with her wrenching depictions of what it is like to be old and alone, and the dream sequences in which she is a lovable aging beauty queen, and you will be building your Ellen Burstyn shrine tomorrow.One fellow whose performance is not given nearly the mention it deserves is Christopher McDonald, who plays Tappy Tibbons, America's favorite television personality. We've all seen Tappy. We can all name dozens of different Tappys. And McDonald's perfect mix of dazzling smiles, charisma, and an undercurrent of evil ('Juice by Tappy! Juice by Tappy!') is more haunting than any supernatural thriller.Darren Aronofsky is a brilliant director. There aren't words to describe the way this film was put together. He dealt with a low budget and over 2,000 cuts, and a brilliant novel/script by Hubert Selby Jr. to produce a truly original piece of film-making. Where was the Academy when this film came out? Possibly the most heartbreaking thing about the plot of this movie is that it's not quite as bleak as we feel like it should be. Yes, you heard me right. We expect that every character will be reduced to a lame creature devoid of hope and dreams. It might even be a comfort to us if they were. And yet, in the final sequence, we see a glimpse of what is left of Sara Goldfarb's dream. 'Requiem' has its title for a reason - she knows that her dream of being on television with her beautiful little boy for the whole world to see is dead, and that's why tears leak from her eyes in the final sequence. They don't damage her glorious smile, but they leave a lasting impression on our hearts. After seeing this disturbing, intense, depressing, horrifying film, we want to ease our own pain, by telling her and the world that it's no good. But we can't bring ourselves to do it.And of course, we have nothing to say.",10,0,1,8 March 2005
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Visually enchanting, musically entertaining, and way, WAY too memorable...
","Anyone who is remotely acquainted with me has probably heard me whine that some movie I saw - and I see a lot of them - just wasn't memorable enough, that I'd forget it in a few years. I saw 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' for the first time at the age of three. Nearly twelve years later, I began dating a young man who was obsessed with it, and I saw it again. Between these two time periods, I remembered the movie far more clearly than I would have liked. A movie isn't worth seeing if you aren't going to remember it, but this one was so bizarre, it stuck out in my memory a bit TOO much.Jack Skellington (Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon) is a...thing...that is eight or perhaps ten feet tall and yet appears to weigh about the same as the average school textbook. He's also the 'Pumpkin King' of a place called Halloweentown, where the distinguishing feature of the residents is that they all look like they recently walked through the mosh pit at Lollapalooza. It is not uncommon to see heads flying around without their bodies or Frankenstein-like creations running around loose or anything out of your childhood nightmares. No wonder Jack is kind of depressed. So when he quite by accident stumbles upon a place called Christmastown, and decides that he would like to bring some Christmas spirit to his homeland, things get a little messy. For one thing, his idea of Christmas cheer is to have Santa Claus kidnapped by another...thing...called Oogie Boogie (Ken Page) and pose as (a rather anorexic) Saint Nick himself. Are you scratching your head yet? You're not alone. There are...things...in Halloweentown which literally scratch their brains.Other main...things (characters)...include Sally (Catherine O'Hara), a Rocky Horror-or-Frankenstein-style creation of a mad scientist who is the object of Jack's romantic affections (and vice-versa); Lock, Shock, and Barrel (Pee-wee Herman, Catherine O'Hara, and Danny Elfman) (Jerry Thorpe fans are picketing outside), three evil little sidekicks who do a good deal of eyebrow-raising, and the Evil Scientist (original, huh? I needed that) who created Sally in the first place. And Santa Claus. But that poor man's been tortured enough.The music is catchy and well-written, the animation is stellar, and the cast dovetails perfectly with the roles. Tim Burton has proved time and time again that he's quite an original director. But some stories are just too weird to get out of the campfire circle, and this might be one of them. Most people I know over the age of thirty-five will curl up like boiled shrimp at the mere mention of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas.' Therefore, while I myself thought it was an entertaining piece of film, I'm not sure it's fit for the public at large. There are some things the world just isn't ready for. Mr. Burton, I commend you. You are way before your time.Grade: B",7,1,1,14 February 2005
Saw," Extreme? Don't make me laugh
","I'll get right to the real reason I hate this film, which is not necessarily because of the concept, the acting, the directing, or a lack of genuine scares. I hate it because it convinced a bunch of idiot kids that they had seen the gut-wrenching of the gut-wrenching when it came to horror films, when they have in fact seen only this, the whitewashed version.I have heard a lot about how 'original' the movie concept was. It's not. There were dozens of movies with 'everyone plays everyone else' themes made before this, many of better conceived. I've also heard a lot about how intriguing the villain was. Persosnally, I can't believe they have now made five full-length films centered around this fellow. He's nothing special; Michael Myers and Norman Bates are more frightening, Regan MacNeil and Damien are more shocking, and Annie Wilkes, Jack Torrance, Lord Summersisle and Hannibal Lecter are all more psychologically mind-numbing.But more than anything, it bothers me that people have the gall to refer to this as 'extreme cinema.' It tries very hard to be, but it fails; the director and writers are too afraid of what the censors might do to them, and it shows. Saw would be fine and marketable as a good watch on Halloween, but this effort I've seen to paint it as some kind of horrific moral treatise is downright insulting.Cannibal Holocaust is extreme cinema. Salo is extreme cinema. Mondo Cane is extreme cinema. Irreversible is extreme cinema. In the Realm of the Senses is extreme cinema. Requiem for a Dream is extreme cinema. This is run-of-the-mill horror. Stop trying to make it into what it's not, and then we can assess it appropriately.",3,4,6,9 November 2008
Dodgeball," Dodgeball: A Truly Nauseating Story
","Most films, even the most worthless ones, have something about them which is meritorious. O Brother, Where Art Thou? had a decent soundtrack. Walking Tall had a good moral. Elf had some cute moments. No viewer should see any of these movies immediately before or after eating. Dodgeball, however, is one of those thankful rarities which should not be seen if the viewer is ever planning to eat again.The plot deals with an apathetic local fitness center owner (Vince Vaughn) who is trying to save his cute little neighborhood gym from a major corporate takeover masterminded by an evil fitness guru (Ben Stiller) with an inflated ego and some other inflated things as well, if you get my drift. In order to raise the money he needs to pay off his debts and save his gym, Vaughn's character Peter LaFleur puts together a ragtag dodgeball team and enters it in a Las Vegas competition. Only problem is, Stiller & Co. have also entered a team. The Average Joe team includes a group of characters that I believe I was supposed to like: a sweet-faced lawyer who turns out to be an Amazon (Christine Taylor), a disillusioned male cheerleader (Justin Long), a man who thinks he is a pirate (Alan Tudyk), a pansy with bottled-up anger (Stephen Root), the Napoleon Dynamite style team manager (Joel David Moore), and another guy (Chris Williams) whom I don't remember anything about, even though I just saw the movie.Of course, no movie is devoid of the occasional shining moment. Rip Torn's former-dodgeball-champion-turned-coach was a likable fellow. I smiled a few times, and even had one or two weak chuckles. The presence of Lance Armstrong and Chuck Norris made me raise my eyebrows, but I had no issue with it. Any of this, however, was canceled out by the horror that was in store in the last ten minutes of the movie.A good ending can save an otherwise mediocre movie (a la Unbreakable or Queen of the Damned). A bad ending sticks in the viewer's memory like a butcher knife. ***SPOILER ALERT*** This was a bad ending. It began when Christine Taylor's character is revealed, for no reason whatsoever, to be a bisexual. It ended with our ten-second view of Ben Stiller's now-washed-up White Goodman, who now weighs about 925 pounds and has lost everything. I nearly threw up everything I had eaten that day when this image came on the screen. It reeked of pure antihumor - it was something one has to see to believe, and I hope for your sake that you never see it.In past movies I have been very impressed with performances by Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughan - they are talented actors. I suppose there was only so much they could do with this miserable screenplay, and frankly I'm shocked they accepted the roles. As for Armstrong and Norris, I usually expect better from them. I can only wonder what they saw in it that possessed them to agree to appear in this disgusting excuse for entertainment. Grade: F.",1,4,11,23 January 2005
