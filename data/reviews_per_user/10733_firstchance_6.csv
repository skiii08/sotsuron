Casablanca," Casablanca
",Casablanca is a tangled love story to me in many ways. I went into the movie completely confident that rick and Ilsa would run away together. I was in fact wrong and didn't even realize it until rick makes her leave with her husband. It's sad in a way that they both fell in love with each other and tired so hard to be together and that it ended in nothing. Rick had a lot of built up anger with Ilsa for leaving him at the pairs train station. Little did he know that she was marriedÂ… I liked the twist in the end with the plot and at last if felt like they had found some peace of mind in knowing that they loved each other. I enjoyed most of the movie and I like the characters. I especially found the pit-pocket character funny in his demeanor and way of speaking. The film was lively and I liked how it exposed the wrong doings of others. Over all I enjoyed the movie and would defiantly watch it again!,Null,0,2,19 October 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes of Wrath
","I appreciate the movie for what it is about, but I really did not enjoy it. I found myself wanting more, maybe some action. I was bored most of the time and it seemed to lull. It could be because the issues they were dealing with don't relate with my life. It put their hardships into reality and I greatly respect the characters and what they had to go through. I don't think I would survive such an event in my life. I just couldn't get past the film. In some of the scenes the sounds were echo like and this bothered me. I did find some of the scenes interesting in retrospect. I like the scene where the children thought they broke the toilet and ran from the owner. I also like the concept of what tom said to his mother. That he was part of one big soul verses just his own. I thought it was a good concept and the actors did a nice job, but the movie just wasn't my cup of tea.",Null,0,1,12 October 2011
The Exorcist," The Exorcist
","I am not a particular fan the exorcist. I find films like this to be slightly disturbing and not to mention freaky. I thought that this film was dark and some of the scenes were discombobulating. I thought that the darker lighting used in some of the scenes was nice and it defiantly helped create the tone. I also found the language used to be interesting because it used profanity. I thought a really cool scene was when the girl was screaming in her room and every imaginable object was flying around the room. I also thought that the actors did a nice creating a sense of despair and uncertainty. I can't say I enjoyed watching this movie because I'm not a fan of these types of movies or content. It really does freak me out, but I am glad that I watched this movie, and I know that I will remember it and never have to watch it again!",Null,0,0,16 December 2011
The Graduate," The Graduate
","The graduate was an interesting film in one sense or another. I thought the content was an interesting pick, but I am glad that I watched this movie. I think some aspects of the content pertain to many people. Not everyone will have an affair that is not what I'm saying. I think that most people can relate to going to college, graduating and then trying to figure out what to do with their lives. I think many people struggle with these issues everyday. Although I'm not from this time era, it was easy to relate to some of the issues. We live in a materialistic world, so it was interesting to see this movie that focused more on difference and finding someone that fit you. I think it was a good film and I even liked some of the sound track, which I found to be funny",Null,0,0,16 December 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Singing in the Rain
","I typically like musicals to some extent, but I can't say they are always my favorite thing to watch. I usually don't wake up in the morning and say 'I'm going to watch a musical today'. However in the film Singing in the Rain I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Growing up with sound I tend to like hearing people's voices. So that I can decipher the tone of voice used and etc. I found this film to pleasantly humorous and yes there were some scenes that I thought could have been shorter, but over all I thought the film was executed nicely. I liked the interactions with the characters and the plot line. I almost fell over after hearing Lina talk! The story line to me was well developed and easy to follow along. I thought the singing in the rain scene was outstanding and I also enjoyed the scene where Cosmo sings and dances! It was a phenomenal long shot and the scene itself was lively. One other scene that I found very impressive was the scene where a woman is dressed in white. She has a very long piece of fabric attached to her garment. I don't know why I found this seen so interesting, considering all she did was walk and move around, but the fabric was suspended in the air for the entire scene. It was simplistic, but beautiful and I can only imagine having to be the woman in that scene. The film kept me entertained and I didn't mind that it was a musical.",Null,0,1,9 November 2011
Psycho," psycho
","Psycho is a movie I have seen more than once in my life. It was usually for different reasons each time, but I have always been a fan of Alfred Hitchcock. I like how the movie is twisted and the characters are very interesting to me. I also like the fact that it's in black and white and I think that the music makes all the difference in the movie. I loved the camera work in this movie as well. The perspective views and then some of the close up were almost abstract in my opinion, but I defiantly enjoyed this film. I think that this film created a lot of suspense in the plot line. The music was also a benefactor in creating drama or suspense as well. I never lost interest in what was happening in the film.",8,0,0,16 December 2011
