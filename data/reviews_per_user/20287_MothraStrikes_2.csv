Casablanca," A movie that can never be topped
","Casablanca has crisp dialogue, great characters, and an awesome setting. Countless films, from the recent 'Quiet American' to the Usual Suspects owe fealty to Casablanca.This movie should be ranked much higher on the tops list than 6. It is vastly superior to Lord of the Rings, Shawshank Redemption, and both Godfather Parts I and II.",10,2,2,29 July 2003
Tombstone," The last great Western
","(Minor Spoilers)Tombstone is flawless.Cosmatos brought performances out of Russell, Biehn, and Elliot that you wouldn't think possible. And Kilmer, man, Kilmer deserved an Academy Award for his portrayal of Doc Holliday. His accent was dead-on, he was the perfect TB-stricken gambler, and his character had as many memorable lines as the entire Godfather Saga.The scenery is perfect, the OK Corral gunfight is choreographed immaculately. The script could dance circles around the slop of 'Wyatt Earp,' and Cosmatos keeps his camerawork tight, never using unnecessary zooms and keeping everyone on screen.The fictional story of the outlaw gang The Cowboys helps to flesh out the movie and to expose the vengeful side of Earp and explain the reasons for his near-mythical status.If Hollywood never makes another Western, it can safely rest on its laurels for its two fitting farewells, Unforgiven and Tombstone.Just go rent it.",Null,1,1,16 April 2003
