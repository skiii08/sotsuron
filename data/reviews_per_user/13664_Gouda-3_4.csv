Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Quite good; not perfect, but good
","With all the voices and opinions and critical ravings about The Phantom Menace, I am sure that one more voice weighing in ain't gonna make that much of a ripple.  But I am a committed fan (in the sense of being devoted, not insane), and I feel the need at least to declare publicly my admiration for Lucas' latest work, and also a few of my concerns.Overall, Episode One ranks above Episode Six, about par with Episode Four, but certainly nowhere near the grandeur and wit of Episode Five. Phantom Menace reminds me of something someone said of Citizen Kane: A hollow masterpiece. PM is technically brilliant, yet it is so technically brilliant that it lacks a certain 'human' warmth.  To me, the best moments were those intimate, interpersonal moments--Padme giving Anakin a blanket, Qui-Gon placing his hands on Anakin's shoulders in the Jedi temple, and ESPECIALLY all those moments with Shmi Skywalker, Anakin's mother.In an interview in Premiere Magazine, Liam Neeson gave a telling anecdote that illustrates my point. First, he noted that Lucas was reticent to give the actors any motivation for lines, expressions, or anything.  In other words, Lucas simply expected the actors to say lines devoid of emotional content, as if the post-production could somehow invest emotional motivation. Neeson revealed that it took him a long time to convince Lucas to allow Qui-Gon to place a hand on Shmi's shoulder after he convinces her to allow him to take Anakin away to Coruscant. That hand on the shoulder was probably the BEST moment in that film, a sign of human connection in a swirling clash of galactic politics gone awry.Traces of post-production fiddling is evidenced most forcefully with Jake Lloyd's Anakin. Watch carefully his scenes at the dinner table, sitting with Qui-Gon at night, and saying goodbye to his mother. Those scenes were clearly doctored in post-production; I believe Lucas took different takes of Lloyd saying lines and splicing those with Pernilla August's. Pay special attention to Anakin after Shmi says, 'He can help you, he was meant to help you.' Anakin's face is clearly digitally manipulated to turn sideways. The first time I noticed it (it was the fourth time I've seen the film) I was taken aback. It was so blatant I began to wonder what other bits were modified that way.On the plus side: Lucas can weave a wonderfully rich narrative tapestry. I love that all this begins with a trade dispute. A trade dispute! Complete with procedural wranglings in a galactic senate rife with corruption and bureaucracy (watch for the cameo appearance of Spielberg's ETs) and a sinister Darth Sidious pulling the political strings. It's the perfect smokescreen to disguise the rise of an evil empire. Every step of the plot has the look of careful craftsmanship; every twist and turn of the plot had relevance.The costumes are outstanding, especially Queen Amidala's Asian-influenced wardrobe.  John Williams has certainly outdone himself with the soundtrack, particularly 'Duel of the Fates,' which introduces choral voices into the Star Wars musical repertoire, ominous voices that sometimes hiss and sometimes howl the forboding Sanskrit text. The production design and cinematography (both real and CGI) create vistas of unparalleled beauty and richness: from the Italianate arches and domes on Naboo, to the art nouveau-inspired underwater air-globes of the Gungans, to the dramatic cityscapes of Coruscant. I can see Academy Awards next year for all these achievements . . .Despite its many drawbacks, I am drawn continually to rewatch The Phantom Menace: for its artistry, for its lines ('There's always a bigger fish'), for those rare human moments, and to soak in this latest addition to the Star Wars text. Yes, the wrapper might be a tad bit flashier than the present inside, but its a gift given with a lot of heart and the best of intentions.",Null,9,12,9 June 1999
Moulin Rouge!," A stunning, visual feast
","At the risk of sounding overly bombastic, 'Moulin Rouge' is the best film I've seen all year, perhaps the best one I've seen in over a year.  It is operatic in the best sense of the word, being at once massively outlandish and deeply personal.  It is clear that a lot of people took career risks in choosing this film, and although 'Moulin Rouge' may not rack up a huge box office, I think this film will become a classic alongside his other two films 'Strictly Ballroom' and 'Romeo + Juliet.'In the showing of 'Moulin Rouge' I saw last week, at least 5 people walked out.  At the same time I heard audience members audibly gasping at the films visuals and talking back to the screen.  The source of these strong reactions?  Baz Luhrmann's confidence in his garish cinematic vision and the commitment his actors have in him.  The cast fills their roles with relish, even when the entire scene totters on the edge of overkill--but oddly enough, it is the focus that sets 'Moulin Rouge' apart from other films these days.  Whereas some actors sleepwalk through their roles as they collect their paychecks, everything about 'Moulin Rouge' is done in earnest.This movie is the anti-'Pearl Harbor,' because instead of being a hodgepodge of market-tested ideas, 'Moulin Rouge' presents a bold vision and dares the audience to accept or reject it.  I, for one, accepted it with delight.  A telling comparison: Luhrmann has Nicole Kidman and Ewen MacGregor sing the film's love song.  Very daring.  For 'Pearl Harbor' Michael Bay chose Faith Hill.  Very safe.  Too safe.  Can you imagine Ben Afleck belting out 'There You'll Be'?'Moulin Rouge' glitters with such bold decisions.  It is a sumptuous feast for ear and eye featuring gorgeous costumes, intricate sets (Nicole Kidman's boudoir in a gigantic elephant is a case in point), and outlandishly choreographed dance numbers are paraded with frenetic relish.  And the music, the MUSIC!  As you probably know by now, Luhrmann has thrown into his period piece a collage of musical snippets from, among many bits, 'The Sound of Music,' Madonna, The Police, and Elton John.  In most cases, no one song gets performed without intersplicing.  Witness Luhrmann's audacity: the opening number includes a melding of Labelle's 'Lady Marmalade' with Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit.'  And here's the spooky part: it works.The entire movie plays this way, and for the most part it works.  Most surpising is that 'Moulin Rouge' has a solid, deeply sincere emotional core. Although the film professes to be about love, I'd add that it is equally about loss.  The Moulin Rouge is a playground where adults pretend they are children with the added spice of sensuality.All the performances are excellent, but the hidden gem is Jim Broadbent as Zidler.  Broadbent for years has been doing majestically understated supporting work, from 'Brazil' to 'Enchanted April' to 'Topsy-Turvy.'  In 'Moulin Rouge' he manages to be both repulsive and endearing.  His spirited rendition of 'Like a Virgin' is classic.  Too bad it's not on the soundtrack.Expect to be overwhelmed by 'Moulin Rouge' in the most unexpected, delightful ways.  It will make you wonder why other films can't or won't dare to be that bold.",Null,312,416,12 June 2001
The Iron Giant," A delightful surprise
","'The Iron Giant' is the kind of animated film you wish there was more of. It respects the audience's intelligence, it has genuine emotion without resorting to schmaltz, and best of all it balances fantasy (well, science fiction) with believability.  I think Warner Brothers animation has out-Disneyed Disney by adding thoughtful writing to clean, understated animation.  What a concept!The story is deceptively simple: Iron Giant falls from the sky at the dawn of the Space Race and befriends a young boy.  But within that framework we get a double story, one for the grown ups and one for the kids, but the message is essentially the same one: paranoia and violence begets violence. I appreciate very much, as others who have commented, that no one burst into incongruous song and that there were no cutesy animal sidekicks.  I should add that there were no clever yet implausible plot twists, nor were there any stock characters.  The bad guy gets a little overheated, true, but he is never the embodiment of all things evil.  The townspeople are your average small town Americans, not bumpkins.  Mom is, well, mom-ish, caring but neither shrewish nor prone to whimpering outbursts.  And our hero is plucky but not annoyingly precocious.A BIG plus for this film is how well it weds the computer animation to the hand-drawn animation, a feat that the Big Mouse hasn't mastered yet.  Even as recently as 'Tarzan' it is glaringly apparent what parts are computer graphics and which aren't, and the contrast is very distracting. 'The Iron Giant' makes a virtue of streamlined animation that draws your eye to the beauty of its color and motion.It was a very VERY distinct and unusual pleasure to be treated to a film such as this.  Give us more . . . please!",Null,147,162,11 August 1999
The Matrix," Productions values great, but Keanu is still wooden
","This is one of the few movies out there where the entire film actually matches the intensity and 'cool factor' of the trailer. From the vast CGI landscapes down to the shell casings of bullets falling in slo-mo, The Matrix presents everything you want in a techno-thriller. The costumes are especially appealing, a bleak Armani vision tempered with flashes of Gaultier. All shades of blacks, greens, and washed out whites permeate.Two drawbacks, and I would argue that they are serious drawbacks (with a possible third looming in the background), make The Matrix a less than ideal actioner. First, nothing--I repeat NOTHING--can excuse Keanu Reeve's dour performance. His career path is inexplicable: how does this guy get work on what some people call 'acting'? The audience I saw this with laughed at his vain attempts to say serious dramatic lines, and even his dry attempts at humor ('I know kung fu' he utters in disbelief) drew laughs at him, not with. Fortunately, Lawrence Fishburne and company make up for him. Second: a lame plot twist near the end of the film completely wrecks the nicely wound storyline. Granted, one must give this film a lot of leeway; but what it asked me to swallow in the end I could not do. I was willing to forgive the long, monologue-ish exposition parts that linked the really groovy special effects sequences, but that bit in the end (you'll know it when you see it) was unpardonable.  Third: the ending leaves no doubt that, barring a minor box office meltdown, there is a sequel in the offing. . .So the film looks GREAT, sounds great, and for the most part unravels a complex plotline (with the one exception) with surprising finesse; I don't usually expect this craftsmanship in a special effects movie. As long as you can ignore Keanu, and the nearly 2.5 hour running time that drags once in a while, this movie is worth a matinee.",Null,1,1,1 April 1999
