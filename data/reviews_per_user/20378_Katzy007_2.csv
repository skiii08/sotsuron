The Blair Witch Project," Very Disappointed
","When one of my friends told me about The Blair Witch Project about a month ago, I was freaked out.  I had to see it.  But when I saw it today, I was very disappointed.  It's not scary.  It's not freaky.  It's just a bad movie.  Period.  The most over-hyped movie of the year.",2,0,2,31 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Unwatchable
","Lets be honest and call this movie what it really is. An unwatchable, boring piece of junk. It's the kind of movie a college student would make who has too much of daddy's money to spend. Next time I want to punish myself for doing a 'bad thing', I will force myself to watch this movie.",1,2,5,25 July 1999
