Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Boring movie, with some mermaids.
","I don't believe I went to this movie expecting it to be as good as the first part - Dead man's chest. And yes I was surprised. What a ridiculous plot!Dead man's chest is one my all time favorite. But for some reason the sequels are all missing the right touch of make up on the characters, and the spice in the dialogs. Of course I missed Orlando and Keira in this movie.I was disappointed with the overall plot of the movie. However, there are parts of the movie that makes you connect to it, and want to sit through this rather long movie.The mermaids - All thanks to the mermaids, the movie kept going.Oh, and don't take your kids to this movie - they will probably start hating all the fairy tales about mermaids.Fun movie, but just wait and watch it on DVD.",6,1,2,31 May 2011
The Hangover Part II," Laugh your heart out
","Zach Galifianakis is the cute, unpredictable, and mischief-maker. The movie starts off with Stu planning his wedding and recollecting memories from Hangover Part 1. Just when you think Phil, Stu, and Alan have learnt a good lesson already, they are back to fun times where they wake up in a room with a Monkey, a finger soaked in blood and dipped in ice, and a notorious drug dealer.To add to the fun, there is a monk, a studious Stanford Scholar, and a smart little monkey who share the ride with you.We all laughed out so loud and went ouch!, and yew! and it was a fun filled 102 min of a movie.Watch and Enjoy!",8,1,4,31 May 2011

Thor," Thrilling and romantic
","Your money is worth every penny of Chris Hemsworth!Chris Hemsworth is amazing, cute, and carries him so well in his role as Thor. Watch the movie to see how he adapts as Thor in both the worlds!Just when you thought that this year has a Natalie Portman overdose, she plays an awesome role as an attractive scientist.This movie has romance, but you can enjoy them with kids. This movie has clashes between evil powers and the heroes - worth the watch! This movie talks is about the dilemma between being a friend and being loyal to the king.This movie makes you want one of those Thor's hammers.I am looking forward to the sequel!",9,0,2,31 May 2011
