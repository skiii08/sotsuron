The Sound of Music," Great Classic Musical ! ! Must watch for all.
","This musical movie is simply great.I watched it as a kid first and have loved it ever since.The movie has a playful theme to it all along.There are some really nice songs like 'Do re me', 'raindrops on roses', 'the hills are alive', etc. The movie begins with beautiful Austrian hills.there are scenic mountains all around where Julie Andrews comes as a happy young girl who happens to be a nun and stays in a convent. She is rather mischievous and playful. The sisters at the convent get tired of her childish behavior and send her as a governess to the children of an ex-naval officer. The children are very naughty and they keep on playing pranks on everyone. Their father is a very strict person and likes the children to be disciplined. He is does not like light and playful behavior with the children. So the children become adamant and rebellious. Maria interacts with children as their friend. she plays with them , teaches them new things like music and dancing. she helps them with their problems and even covers up their mistakes from their father. She then brings them close to him for which he is grateful to her. This results in a bond between them. and during the war they flee together.",10,1,7,15 June 2006
