Iron Man 3," Damp Squib villain
","The movie lacks a strong Foe for our hero. Even though the plot to mask the real villain was good, the fact that the actual villain had so little screen presence as against the fake one (the Mandarin) killed the excitement of the final clash and movie built up. It seems like the writers and directors also felt the actual villain was inadequate and gave him dragon like ability to breathe fire as an afterthought 'Why just give him the power to throw fire and not his henchmen!!'. The fact that Iron man makes hundreds of robots and they face off with army of villains at the climax takes the charm off the usual 'Hero fighting and defeating all enemy himself' feeling. Also, giving pepper potts the iron man suit and then regeneration power of the villain in the end makes me feel that they wanted greater involvement from leading lady ,making the entire portrayal feel forced just to get a ending with her in frame. In all the Movie failed to keep me glued to the seat and I felt the previous parts were better in terms of balance, action, acting and finish.",7,0,1,21 June 2013
Man of Steel," Not as good as the ratings suggests
","Surprised to find the movie rated so highly, despite the fact that the story development seemed weak. The characters felt hollow. The depth of story ,emotions were sacrificed for the cheap thrill of the looooooong climax fight scene. The final 30 minutes were similar to many other movies from last few years with two major themes 1. Destruction of the NY city. (and it lacks any awesomeness of any kind in this movie) 2. Creation of a equal and opposite force same as the hero. And again another looooong unenjoyable tussle between them.The movie felt like a mis-mash of multiple other movies like Gi-Joe,Avengers, Spiderman.. with few scenes and pattern lifted straight out of the aforementioned movies. The lack of effort from director and writers to make this something different and something really great is surprising. Having said that, movie is a superhero movie and can be a good one time watch if you go in with no expectations.",6,3,7,19 June 2013
