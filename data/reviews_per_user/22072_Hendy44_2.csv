Casablanca," Casablanca review
",I enjoyed this film somewhat. it was about a man who was living in Casablanca as a bar owner who was from New York City and was moved to Casablanca from France. he met a woman while in France and they fell in love. However the woman that the man thought loved him turned out to be a fake and was talking to a war prisoner behind Rick's (bar owner) back. the story continues to unfold after a long time of being apart they finally meet again only this time it was under very different circumstances. as the war moves on nobody knows what is going to happen next. all people in Casablanca aren't able to leave without a certain VISA which is very hard to come by unless you have money. The movie ends in a very unexpected way as rick decides to stay in Casablanca and the love of his life takes the plane away to America.,Null,0,1,2 March 2016

",I am not a big fan of musicals but the colors and the music in this movie really made it for me i enjoyed the fact that the music fitted exactly with what was going on throughout the movie however i do not think ill ever be watching this film again because like in said i just do not like musicals. however besides that you can only appreciate the film for what its worth there was much emotion in this film and that what i liked and could really take away from it. All that being said it's good family-type entertainment and they couldn't make a musical like this today. Multi-talented performers like these are gone forever and i feel like that is something that needs to change very soon .,Null,0,0,25 April 2016
