Who Framed Roger Rabbit," One Whaky Toon Movie
","Special effects are excellent in this movie. Mel Blanc did a bunch of the original cartoon voices he once did. Why didn't he do Yosemite Sam? Interacting the toons with real people made the movie that much more enjoyable. Christopher Lloyd was perfect as Judge Doom. Lloyd has proved that he can be a serious actor as well as a comical one. Bob Hoskins is great as Eddie Valiant, and did an excellent job with that straight accent. (This was before I knew he was British). I couldn't tell. A well thought out story.",8,1,1,25 August 2002
Face_Off," An edge of your seat thriller!
","This movie ranks up there with the best. Travolta and Cage must take on each others identity, and they really pull it off. Cage, as Castor Troy is a totally fanatical killer. He shows this in the beginning of the movie when Travolta catches up to him, and they have guns on each other. Travolta hates the idea of taking on Cages' identity to find out where he has hidden a bomb. The idea of 'transplanting' faces is not too far-fetched in this day and age. Travolta gives a great performance as Archer. He must deal with the murder of his son, and face the man who did it. It is great to see how these characters face off against each other. Troy's character really surfaces when he goes to the prison to visit Archer and says, 'You'll be here for the next hundred years.' Archers' love for his wife is unquestioned, and it is the love that ultimately gets him through.",9,1,3,25 August 2002
The Dirty Dozen," Good war movie!
","Robert Aldrich really outdoes himself with this movie. He put together an all star cast that gave a great performance! Lee Marvin is tasked to mold a bunch of army prisoners into a crack team. Their mission is to infiltrate a chateau in France where high ranking German officers take leave. These army prisoners are the worst of the worst. Telly Savalas is the craziest of the bunch as Arthur Maggot (fitting name). Lee Marvin must convince these prisoners that it would be in their best interest to listen to what he has to say. He makes it known that if they are successful with the mission, they wlll be givin pardons, but if they mess up, they go back to prison to await the execution of their sentences. Charles Bronson gives probably one of his best performances in this movie. Donald Sutherland also fit in as a rather odd character. He plays an even better one in 'Kelly's Heroes' (Oddball). As it turns out, the group is succesful in its mission, and there is only one survivor from the original dozen, (Bronson). A Very good movie that I would reccommend to anyone.",8,0,1,19 October 2002
Rudy," One of the best football movies!
","This is without a doubt, one of the best football movies I have ever seen. Sean Austin does such a superb job at Rudy Rutigger, a young steel mill worker from Joliett, Illinois who aspires to attend Notre Dame, and play football. He is very undersized (5ft 7in) and 170 pounds. He makes it known that he intends to make the team. First of all, Rudy had to fight really hard just to get into Notre Dame. Rudy hires himself a tutor, and constantly applies for admission. Just when everything looks bleak, he is finally accepted. Coach Ara Parshigan sees that Rudy has a lot of heart, and wishes all his players were the same. Rudy makes the team, and is assigned to the practice squad. At first he puts up with a lot of flack from the other players who think that Rudy is making them look bad. They finally come to realize that he really wants to make the team. When Rudy fails to find his name among those that are being allowed to suit up, he is disgusted, and quits the team. He has a conversation with one of the janitors at the field, who is Rudy's good friend, and is told that he must not quit. Rudy finds out that this person was also on Notre Dame's football team, but never got to play, and quit. He points out to Rudy that 'not a week has gone by that I didn't regret my decision.' Rudy returns to practice, and is welcomed by his teammates. He goes to Coach Parshigan, and asks to be allowed to suit up for one game the next season. The coach agrees, but later on resigns. The new coach, Dan Devine, does not see Rudy the way Parshigan did. When the last home game of the season against Georgia Tech comes, the players all want to give up thier starting spots to allow Rudy to play. Rudy fulfulls the dream of a lifetime when he gets to lead the team out of the tunnel. As it turns out, Notre Dame completely dominated Georgia Tech, and the players realize that Rudy might not get to play, despite their begging Coach Devine to let him play. The offense scores one final touchdown, with time running out, and Rudy comes on the field as a special teamer. He is then told by the assistant coach to stay on the field, and on the next play, Rudy sacks the quarterback just as time runs out. This is a very moving movie, and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. I just added this movie to my collection, and the DVD version is the best. The real Rudy Ruttiger does a short commentary, which eveyone should see.",10,1,1,6 December 2002
Hoosiers," Great Movie!
","This is an excellent movie for anyone who is a basketball fan. Gene Hackman did a outstanding job as coach Norman Dale. He is faced with bringing a small Indiana town's high school basketball team together. The coach has a questionable past,but really wants to work with this team. The  town holds a referundum as to whether or not to fire the coach, and one of the players informs the town that 'IF he stays, I play, but if he goes, I go'. It was great to see how these players rallyed around the coach. He was assisted by Dennis Hopper, who's a drnkard and his son plays on the team. At first his son doesn't like the fact that his dad is coaching, but later comes around. It was great to see how this coach molded the players into a team, and take them to the state finals. I want to add this movie to my collection. It is worthy of any collection.",Null,1,1,6 September 2002
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Best Movie Of It's Time
","This probably the best movie that Jack Nicholson ever did. His performance outranks anything he has ever done. As Randle P. MacMurphy, he is a convict that just doesn't get along. It is decided to have him checked out at a mental hospital, which to him is a big joyride. He meets some patients there, and soon has them doing things for themselves. He is especially fond of the Chief, played by Will Sampson. The chief has the staff at the hospital beleiving that he is deaf and dumb, and he is neither. MacMurphy is the only one that knows this. He also develops a true hatred for Nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher). MacMurphy shows his dislike for her by constantly breaking the rules. He takes the patients on a bus ride, and then on a fishing trip. He also brings in some women and booze to have a party on the ward. He was already givin shock treatments for interfering in a fight on the ward, and after Nurse Ratched causes Billy to commit suicide, MacMurphy really loses it, and tries to choke Nurse Ratched. It is decided that MacMurphy is dangerous, and he is givin a lobotomy. The Chief, after seeing his friend a vegetable, decides that he does not want the other patients to see him in that condition, and smothers MacMurphy. After this, the Chief escapes from the hospital using the water cooler to break the window. This is in homage to MacMurphy, and is very moving. Again, I say this is the best movie of it's time.",10,1,3,10 October 2002
The Green Mile," One Unique Movie
","This is one of those rare movies that really touch you. Tom Hanks does a great job as Paul Edgecomb. It's a little different from other roles he has had, but good nonetheless. Michael Clark Duncan really steals the show as the huge, softspoken, and kindly John Coffey. He was nominated for best supporting actor, and should have received it. Doug Hutchison has one of the most difficult parts as Percy Whetmore. He does a magnificent job with the role. John Coffey arrives on death row at Cold Mountain Prison in 1935, accused of killing two young girls. As it turns out, he is completely innocent, but prefers to go to his death anyway. Paul is suffering with a painful infection that John eventually cures him of.Del (Michael Jeter) is another prisoner slated to die in the electric chair who befriends a mouse named 'Mr. Jingles'. Percy deliberately kills the mouse, and John brings it back to life, giving witness to his great healing powers. Percy is a spoiled brat, with connections to the governor. He uses this to more or less throw his weight around with the other guards, but gets his in the end. He should have taken that job at the mental institution. This is one movie that grabbed my attention at the beginning, and held it until the end.",10,1,2,26 August 2002
