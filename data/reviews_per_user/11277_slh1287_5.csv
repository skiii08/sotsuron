Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Yes!!
","Well, I had very low expectations for this film, but bought it from a $1 bin to watch with my mother because her and I both love vampire movies and/or television shows and series. So, obviously, it surprised me when it ended up being a good movie. Lots of action, creepy-looking vampires, and Abe's signature axe. I loved it. Very few dull moments, if any. But, if a strong, in-depth story line with a big twist of a plot is what you're after, steer clear of this one. Vampire- slaying Abe is not for you. This is strictly entertainment here. And it was a lot of fun to watch, and gave me quite a bit more than I was expecting from it. Go Abe!!",8,0,1,19 April 2014
Argo," Excellent
","Very good. The end was so full of suspense, I found that I was actually holding my breath through it! Awesome cast, all of whom did a great job with each of their characters and the parts they played. The only reason for a slightly less than perfect score is due to one or two slow scenes throughout the film. But they don't affect the actual quality of this magnificent movie. All in all, this one is definitely worth a purchase, or at the very least, to rent- either way, just watch it. As I've already said 50 times in this review, Argo is an excellent film, and if you still haven't seen it, when you do, you'll be very happy you did. I was!!",9,0,2,22 April 2014
127 Hours," Not as good as expected
","Overall pretty good movie. Was slow at times, almost boring, but always bounced back. I realize that films made with 99% of the shots on one person have to be a little hard to keep interesting. Based on that, it was done well. Gave some intense scenes, and made me think about what choice I might make if put into his situation! James Franco did an excellent job, though. Before this movie, I had only seen him in comedies, but he does very well in dramatic roles, too. As of now, I've seen him play numerous different characters, but 127 Hours is the first film to make me take him seriously as an actor. So, again, great acting, just a little slow.",7,0,0,18 April 2014
50_50," Must not have been for me...
","This film scored a 7.8 on IMDb. Awesome. I'm glad others liked it, because it had good actors who did their jobs very well. But in my opinion, 50/50 was only somewhat funny- well, it had funny parts to it. A so/so movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt is one of my favorite actors, and he did a great job here, but, to me, that still couldn't make 50/50 a great film. Seth Rogen played his usual humorous part, and I do like that the writers/director incorporated that humor into what would have been a horribly sad movie otherwise. Luckily, I and those close to me have never been diagnosed with a terminal illness, so I could never question the authenticity of that portrayal. But his slow decline in health seemed very realistic. So, for this film, others' reviews may be more helpful, because my lack of love for this movie seems to be an opinion i stand alone by!",6,1,2,19 April 2014
300," Awesome!!
","So, I may be a little biased with this review, because I absolutely LOVE movies, television series, books, etc based on these older time periods. Even so, this was an excellent movie, with a great cast, about a group of heroic men fighting for their Spartan freedom. I just think the way these people lived and the things they had to do are so interesting. This film shows an incredible act of bravery and gives new meaning to the quote 'if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything.' My only reason for not giving 300 a perfect score is that I hoped it would be a little longer. The actual film, in my eyes, was perfect, I just wanted more of it.",9,1,2,18 April 2014
