Sucker Punch," Great Visuals + Anime-styled action
","The plot lacks of some development, as well as some of the characters, however, it is very entertaining to see the action scenes in their surrealism, yet it is very anime-styled action,*** SPOILER ***Basically our main hero is a small girl which creates a surreal world to survive a place where girls are orphans sexually exploited, in her surreal world she fight's against giant monsters, robots, soldiers and such in a small skirt while getting objects needed to escape from the place.***************I would recommend to see this movie on a free night one might have, i think it wouldn't be a waste to pay cinema price for the visuals in this movie but it would be OK to watch it on a DVD as well, i've found this movie enjoyable.",Null,2,3,8 September 2011
