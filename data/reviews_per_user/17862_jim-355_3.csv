Casablanca," What about the Music in Casablanca?
","Yes! Yes! I agree! Casablanca is an excellent movie. Action, adventure, romance, patriotism--'Play La Marseillaise. Play it', Nazi villains, idealism, and yes comedy--'I'm shocked, shocked to find gambling going on in this place. Your winnings sir.' It is indeed one of the most quotable films ever. It seems everyone has a line worth repeating, however Bogey has the best ones. But what about the music? It was Max Steiner at his best!PS Besides 'As Time Goes By' and 'La Marseillaise' name at least one other song either played or sung during the movie. No fair going to the video.",10,2,2,19 April 2000
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Romantic Screwball Comedy???
","So, what do I know? This movie started off very serious with Steve Carell jumping out of a car because his wife just made love to another man. Depressing start that turned into a romantic movie. Delightfully so, it also turned into a 'screwball comedy' with the introduction of the Marisa Tomei character and I mean character. Carol Lombard I hope you are watching! In the end it all turns out to be a very good romantic comedy. Oh, yes! The backyard scene was superb, all of the actors and I mean all just pulled it off. Go see it! A very good movie. By the way, even though the cast is star laden it is Steve Carell's movie. And it was not his 'Office' character, but a blend of Cary Grant, James Stewart, a little John Travolta and William Powell. Yes, the screwball comedy elite actors.",Null,0,1,8 August 2011
The Artist," It's the Dog!
","You have heard it before! This movie draws comparisons to 'A Star is Born', 'Singin' in the Rain', 'City Lights' and in my opinion every 'Thin Man' movie that Asta was in. And speaking of 'Singin' in the Rain' did anyone notice the eerie resemblance to Jean Hagen in this movie? Well, back to the dog! My wife is an animal lover and hates to see movies where animals get hurt. Refueses to ever see 'The Wizard of Oz' and any 'Lassie' movie. No need to worry about this movie. Uggie the dog steals every scene he is in and plays an integral part in the outcome of the movie. (Spoiler!) The 'Bang' scene with the dog is quite moving.Any awards given to this movie are much deserved. You will be entertained and leave with a smile on your face. Oh, there are few spoken words and just for you trivia people, Marcel Marceau does not appear in the movie.",10,2,3,30 December 2011
