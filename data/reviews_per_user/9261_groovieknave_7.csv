Blade Runner 2049," Horrible...
","I don't know why people are giving this movie a 10/10, or why there are even 10 star ratings... holy moly. It's like fake Amazon reviews, were these people given some kind of compensation for 10/10 reviews? This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's so boring I wanted to sleep the whole time I was forcing myself to watch it. I wished I hadn't paid for it, I regret it so much. The only good thing about it is the acting. Nothing happens in this movie, at all... it's like watching cut scenes in a video game that you can't play and all the action or significant moments were during gameplay. I truly believe IMDB reviews are fraudulent.",2,3,11,13 September 2018
Hereditary," Not the worst, but not the best...
","This movie is very creepy, it's a slow burn though so be prepared. The acting is absolutely amazing! Toni Collette is something else, she's just impressive and that's worth watching alone even if you don't like horror. The performances are insanely good by most everyone with screen time.The biggest problem with horror is the irrational behavior that occurs during the films. I just don't see how it's possible for certain actions in this film to have taken place and that's why it will never be scary enough. If only they could just leave out the out of this world behavior. For example, there's a scene where a child is having an allergic reaction and she sticks her head out of a moving vehicle. I'm sorry, I just can't get into a movie with something that stupid! Just let them have an accident... why does it have to be so moronic?This movie could have been so much more scary without the nonsense. If you see it you will know what I mean. I would have been much more scared out of my mind if the incidents that lead the plot would have been much more realistic. A satanic cult with a subtle supernatural hint, and crazy nightmares would have freaked me the hell out! The atmosphere and acting were stellar, and it was well put together. It's only fault is being silly with what happens, just stick with some reality, just some, when it comes to horror! Whenever you writers and directors feel like making irrational behavior, put it all into the crazy characters... not the victims! Sigh.",6,4,8,23 August 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Decent, but lacks suspense
","I didn't really expect much because of Force Awakens, I just wanted to see some lightsabers. Didn't even get much of that... It's the same story as A New Hope... seriously. I was rolling my eyes, it's almost identical in plot. I wouldn't have minded that if they actually tried to make any characters, instead they just had bodies on the screen repeating the script. The acting was good and the production value is high, but I just didn't care about anyone. The robot had more character than the living beings. Not sure why they hate developing characters in movies now, probably because the mindless masses like their special fx and things blowing up. I don't even remember most of the movie because I was so bored and dying to check my cellphone for messages. There's no suspense involved, and the clich√© ending probably has people falling all over themselves to get a Darth Vader doll for Christmas. I liked the FX, I liked the sets, but I don't even know any of the characters names. Don't care either, next star wars movie I'm waiting for Netflix.",6,8,16,16 December 2016
Suicide Squad," Boring, stupid, lame, nonsense
","1 Star for the costumes... the rest is utter garbage. Terrible dialogue, half arsed story, very, very bad directing, extremely lame plot. I can not even tell what happened during the action scenes. The Joker is a joke, I couldn't have cared less about any of these characters. No suspense, no interesting anything... huge missed opportunity for whoever made this garbage. I'm getting sick of these movies that don't put any effort into character development or suspense whatsoever. I don't know how people can enjoy the movies without at least any character development at all. Showing them isn't enough. The humor was eye-rolling and gutwrenching. I'm not a fan of the jokers look either, I don't even understand what they were trying to pull off with this story. Waste of a movie if you ask me...",1,9,15,8 August 2016
Man of Steel," Terrible
","It starts out like Avatar and ends with stupid, and in the middle there's a glimmer of hope. All I got from this movie is that Superman is a jerk. His parents save him by the most insanely Avatarish world to die in a dying world while he goes to Earth to be a jerk. You would think his parents raised him properly, but no they didn't. In fact his Earth Dad watches him get beat up by kids and doesn't shout at them to stop he just waits until they torture him. Then his Dad is like, well, you know. Just don't be a jerk when you have every right to be, okay?Then some good movie goes on for awhile until this tornado rolls in and then it gets stupid. Like, really stupid. I would repeat the word 'really' a lot but I just want you to know there is emphasis on that. The dog is in the car, so instead of Superman going around a corner and saving the dog at super speed his dumb Dad is like, no don't do anything. I'm going into the tornado to kill me and the dog, alright? You guys just sit here and watch. Instead of holding his dad back at least... and you know, Martha is like, go for it go kill you and the dog! She doesn't stop him either, they're like no it's okay, this is what we do. We let our senile family kill themselves in tornados while we watch. I mean, come on, who wrote this nonsense? Just let them have a sad moment where they're like aw crap the dog died in the tornado, and his dad stresses out and has a heart attack over the excitement while they hold him back and he dies anyway so it's a really horrible time?? Who writes this crap? People rated this movie over 7, I just don't get it! I didn't know we rated movies by special FX these days. Anyway, then some fairly decent movie goes on until they all start fighting in the city. Superman is a jerk the whole time. He stops the world destroyer like many miles away from the city where all the people are instead of stopping the one in the city that's killing everyone. What a jerk, just terrible decision making on a superheros part. Then he comes back to the city instead of just staying there the whole time, to put more lives in danger. Him and Zod toss each other around for like however long I was looking at my watch and sighing. Then they not only dumb the movie down and cause me to stand up out of my seat, not only did they dumb the movie down further into pits of stupidity like religion kills innocent people, they force superman to kill. Goes beyond the code of superman we've come to know, though he was a violent and destructive fellow, he's no murderer. Maybe an accident at worst, or doesn't do much to help an SOB when he kills himself, but this?? Let me set the scene here for you... Zod is on his knees, and Superman is holding his head like he can't stop it from turning a couple inches. I'm rolling my eyes, cause there's these idiots just standing there as if they can't duck and run or move. But I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say they are paralyzed by weird heat vision coming at them. Deer in headlights phenomenon or something right? I'm not really much of a stickler for realism in movies, all I ask in staying consistent within the world created in the movie. You know? Just keep me immersed and believing it no matter how far fetched it may be. Don't do anything completely out of the ordinary of the story itself, right? No, I should have known they couldn't do this right opening up with Avatar and killing a Dad over a dog in a tornado that he could have saved. He can't stop a heart attack, that's fair but he can save a dog and a dad from a tornado. That's Superman. They already proved he could in the story. He also just demolished a world destroying mechanical machine probably weighs ridiculous amounts more than Zod's head. He withstood so much damage and just before this they were knocking each other all over the city. But suddenly he can't stop heat vision? He can't put his hands over his eyes like 'guess what Zod? It's over, nice try though funny guy!' He can't stop his head by forcing it to turn? So to stop him... he turns his head really hard! I'd repeat the word 'really...' you get the idea. He turns his head so hard he kills Zod, ruins supermans code, and completely destroying all hopes that movies are any good these days. They have no idea what they are doing. Who does this nonsense? Who lets these ideas go on? I mean, we all have our off days but this movie took a lot more than days to write. Then they went and made it even though it was written stupidly, like a disaster! That's even more insulting. I can't believe we can't get a refund, I never wanted a refund more in my life. Holy hell!This is just the typical movie writing coming out of these blockbusters. No need to make sense or be consistent. Just toss things together and make it look good will you? People will rate it high, spend their money, it's no loss, it's profit!It truly is too, I will never visit the theater again, either it comes to netflix streaming or no deal. This has gone on long enough.",1,3,8,11 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It's good, just not amazing like everyone hoped
","This is probably my new favorite Star Wars movie, it used to be Return of the Jedi. Why? Well, I'm not sure. Probably because after the prequels anything is better than those. I couldn't even stay awake for the Phantom Menace and didn't bother to go to the theater for the other two. This movie has very little character development, and a very fast pace. Great if you're willing to accept that you don't care much for any of the characters. Due to the pacing of the movie there are all too convenient things happening to push the pace. Like, someone runs off and fights in the woods but somehow their friend shows up right in front of them to move them to the next scene. It's also extremely ridiculous, Luke had to go through training and failure to come back powerful in a whole different movie, which made it epic. But this one everybody can just do enough to be proud of themselves and feel good. But since there was no character development I'm sure they felt they had to do that. The movie is quite entertaining from start to finish, but in an action mood. There's not much drama really, thankfully, I'm not really into whining and angst like Luke had... especially with his high pitched voice. The story is very similar to New Hope... if it ain't broke... I guess. They added some random scenes and nostalgia, I can tell they banked hard on the nostalgia of the original characters. It worked really well as I'm sure this movie will go over a billion dollars.I could think of a million stories to follow Return of the Jedi, but I'm sure this is the one that makes a billion bucks. I can't complain too much because somehow I enjoyed the movie myself. The lack of character development and I guess suspense is what is missing from it that made me hack of several stars. With the little character development that they had I was able to I guess, imagine, how the characters might feel. But if I wanted to do that I would read a book. I was hoping to feel for them like I felt for Luke when his family died, or when his hand got chopped off, I mean how embarrassing and humiliating it was for him. I remember it clearly, and this movie, well... I remember when the original characters were on screen. The new ones... well they didn't give me much to remember. So if you're willing to go through a similar story with some feel good moments and some laughs and nostalgia then you'll enjoy the movie. But if you're looking for something to top the Star Wars movies franchise you're out of luck. The originals are still the best and always will be... unless somehow pop culture changes and the billionaires get some guts to tell a story. Right now, they bank on rehashing things... and so that's what we got.",7,1,10,25 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Garbage the masses love to eat up
","Bald morons spraying their mouth with... something, for some reason. Stuff blows up and people scream, and IMDb community comes running with about 60,000 10/10 reviews. What has the world come to? The entire cast may have said about 20 words combined, and none of them can speak clearly. They all mumble in really loud cars, pretty sure they couldn't hear each other at all cause I couldn't understand much. But doesn't matter anyway... all you need to know is BOOM!em that nobody makes that stuff anymore? Pretty sure these guys couldn't have survived at all... especially the main guy who apparently has some weird illness that might have made sense if they tried to you know, tell a story. Instead they're just like, he needs some weird creepy stuff to make him bad!As soon as I saw Tom Hardy eat a lizard I bowed my head in shame and immediately regretted setting foot into the theater. I find it hard to believe that the original director had anything to do with this garbage, unless he has gone completely stupid or needed a lot of money or something. I don't know, but I'm sure he had hardly anything to do with this. If he is of sound mind, he should be ashamed and happy with all the money he's getting from this sell out. Here's a list of all the problems in this movie: No character development, couldn't care about anybody No story, no back story, no side story, no explanation of anything. No suspense, no drama, no acting, bodies move No plot twist (unless you count going back to the place they were getting away from, which is really dumb) No memorable scenes, no memorable dialog No relatable characters, or anything to relate to at all Filmed in a boring desert (they couldn't find a city in ruins? for people running out of water, they sure chose a really retarded place to camp) This was poorly named... it's not a Mad Max movie, it's a Charlize Theron movie. Here's a list of things to like: Sound/music, explosions, prop designs on a grand scale for post apocalypse. Very cool in that regard. So that earns it... 3 stars. Here's a list of things they didn't explain: Who is Mad Max? I mean we're talking 30 years later Who is Theron? I don't even remember her name Who is the bad guy? I don't even remember his name, I don't remember anyones name Who are the women, and why are they breeding? Can't they just breed with anyone? Why are they dumping water on a bunch of people from a giant rock? Why would they build that in a desert, and where is the water coming from? Why are all these people here in this guys dump with him? I mean what does he do that's so special that got everybody praising him and worshiping him? How in the hell did Theron get these special breeders out of their amazing fortress in a giant rock?? That's a lot of bodies to fit in a small compartment in a semi too... man, they must have some kind of stealth! Why is everyone a complete dumb ass except Theron? Why is Theron the main character in a movie titled Mad Max? Why... when they went all that way to the place Theron wanted to go to, did Max tell them there's no point in going on, they need to go back? He's the one who ran away from these dudes in the first place!! He didn't even know about Therons place, but now he's like... I gotta go back to the place they captured me?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!!?!?!?!?! I could list a bunch more stuff, like how are people on stilts surviving in the middle of nowhere? But I just don't want to waste any more time on this movie. I've got the feeling that they spend a few million on paying people to review the movie with 10 stars on IMDb. Ugh. I can't believe the mindlessness of people these days. There is barely anything interesting in this movie, it was 1hour 40 minutes too long... extremely boring. I wanted to walk out, but paying 15$ for this I kind of had to stay didn't I? Garbage like this is a dime a dozen lately, if you like this garbage you will probably like the Avengers, Hobbit, Hunger Games... I don't know how you can enjoy that nonsense. But the masses rule our entertainment apparently. Money is everything.",3,11,28,18 May 2015
