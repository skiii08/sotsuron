It," 'IT' Doesn't Deserve Even One Star
","If I could give this flick less than one star, I would. I grew up watching the Universal horror classics, Hammer films, etc., so I know -- and enjoy -- a good horror flick. This one was just awful. The viewer never gets to learn anything about Pennywise (e.g., the source of his supernatural power) or why he does what he does. The film's only redeeming feature is the fine acting by several of the young cast members, especially Jeremy Ray Taylor and Sophia Lillis.Contrary to what other posters have claimed, this is not the best Stephen King adaptation. In my opinion 'Salem's Lot (1979)' was the best and, interestingly, was done when Americans could see first- class entertainment for free through made-for-TV network movies.I paid over $17 in Manhattan to see this extremely dull, silly flick and if I can prevent someone from wasting his/her time and money my suffering was not in vain.",Null,2,5,8 October 2017
La Vie En Rose," Marion Cotillard's Piaf is Extraordinary
","Cotillard's depiction of Piaf is the role which will define her acting career. Her flawless performance puts her on par with not only the other great talents of her generation (e.g., Cate Blanchett), but earns her a place in film history. The role is a challenging one because Cotillard (who is 31) had to persuade viewers she was the adolescent Piaf as well as the 47 year-old invalided by drugs, arthritis, and cancer. Cotillard is a chameleon, and every gesture, look, movement, and word is credible and deeply moving. She also gives Piaf dignity, because though the icon is a physical ruin, Cotillard (and the director) did not let her become bitter. The film itself is 'merely' an excellent biopic; Cotillard has arrived.",Null,1,4,9 June 2007
