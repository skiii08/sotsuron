Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awesome!
","this is wat started my love for movies. I remember when this came out i was so excited and it didn't disappoint. The only problem is that wen ur a little kid, you cant sit long enough to watch this movie. But the action scenes were great. The only reason why i didn't give this movie a 10 out of 10 is because they kill off Darth Maul! He was awesome! He had the double bladed light saber that kicked ass! I had the darth maul action figure when i was a little kid. Good times.If u have never seen this movie you deserved to be covered in spaghetti cuz this movie kicked ass (besides the fact that darth maul dies).GREAT MOVIE",9,6,9,25 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The best star wars movie.....EVER
","This one deserves 11 out of 10! Best movie in the WHOLE star wars trilogy. If I'm ever flicking throw the channels and i see this movie, i automatically watch it.Constant action through the whole movie (i don't think there is one part which is boring). The fight with Boba Fett at the sand pit was a memory I will never forget. As well as the final battle between Luke and Darthe Vader and Darth Vader's change of heart at the end.This one just rapes all of the other star wars movies and will go down in history as the end of the star wars trilogy.So thats the end of my comments on star wars flicks. Go ahead and check out my other ones if you want :)",10,0,2,25 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Even better!
","If you read my comment on episode one, you'll know how psyched i was when phantom menace came out. But this one was more action packed than the first!Once again, if u have never seen this movie, you deserve to be covered in spaghetti cuz this one had awesome special effects and twice as much action.I didn't give it a 10 out of 10 because it was missing some of its original flavour from the 1st, 4th, 5th and 6th (which is my favorite) GO SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU ALREADY Haven't!!!PS:im doin one for all the star wars trilogy so check those out too :)",9,2,2,25 May 2008
The Mist," .........wow.......I cant even describe it........wow.......deserves a 0.1 out of ten
","I did not feel the magic in this movie. I my opinion.....it was terrible. I wouldn't even classify this as a horror movie. Just a bunch of blood and gore. Not at one point in the movie was i scared. I think it was a waste of time. I watched this with a couple of my friends and we all hated it. The ending was just terrible! When the movie was done, me and my friends just stared at the credits rolling with our mouths open. We could not believe it. Some of you might think that I'm being a little too harsh (and maybe i am) because there was some good parts to the movie but just not enough to make it a good movie. This movie is more or less a terrible version of AVP Requiem (actually AVPR was more gorier). I would give this movie a 0.1 out of 10 if i could. If you feel like being absolutely disturbed, the be my guest and watch the movie. But if you like REAL horror movies (like the mothman prophecies) who don't rely on blood and gore to make a horror movie and actually make it scary, then take my advice and don't watch the Mist.",1,5,26,25 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," nice dice
","Other than the 6th star wars movie, this one is my favorite. Great storyline on how Anakin goes to the dark side which was necessary to show. This episode finally fills in the gaps of the storyline and has intense action and special effects Definitely a MUST-SEE! (even though I'm pretty sure everyone saw this movie :P) This movie shows the fall of the Jedi by the betrayals of the clones and of Anakin Skywalker. The final scene with Obi-Wan and Anakin was intense and will definitely go down in movie history.Great movie, go see it if you haven't, and if you have, watch it again cuz this one is INTENSE!",10,1,5,25 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," This movie goes down in history!
","When you watch this movie today, you may think that it is lame. All i have to say is THIS IS THE MOVIE THAT STARTED IT ALL!!! I know i wasn't born when this came into theaters, but I do know that the special effects were AMAZING for that time. And the people that think this movie is lame are too new age. They think that modern special effects make a good movie.The only reason that I gave this a 9 out of 10 is because if this is the first star wars movie you see, you may be confused. Holes in the plot (that are later filled) are frequent but in the long run, who really cares? Great movie, it started the star wars movie trilogy and this movie can hands-down be considered a classic and a MUST-SEE",9,0,0,25 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," 'Luke, I am your father'
","Thats right. The legendary movie dialog is in this film.'Luke, I am your father!' I have to admit though, i didn't see everything in this movie. Only a few parts i missed and i think i got the just of it. The introduction of yoda (in the original trilogy) was awesome.Good movie. Not my favorite of the trilogy, but a must-see none the less. It definitely deserves some credit and MUCH better special effects than A new hope.My favorite part was when Luke was training to be a jedi with the help of yoda :). Good movie, good special effects, go see it and im sure you wont be disappointed",8,0,1,25 May 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Great......but missed a couple of things.....
","I really enjoyed this movie. Its worth the time to watch it. There were a couple of things i noticed that could have been better though.For instance, if your a simpsons fan you'll notice one thing about the movie. NO SIDESHOW BOB. Thats right. there is no sideshow bob in this movie. They definitely should've added him in there. Another thing is that (like family guy) they should've done their move in the middle of their many seasons. Maybe if they would've done this, it wouldve been much more funnier (because the new simpson episodes are starting to get weird) PS: When i said it wouldve been funnier i was not saying that it was not funny (because i found it hilarious) PSS: If any of you are watching the new simpson episodes you'll know that homer's mother dies :'( WTF!!!",Null,0,0,25 May 2008
