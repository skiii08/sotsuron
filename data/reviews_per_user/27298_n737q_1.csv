United 93," I was so taken back to that day, I the felt same feelings.
","The average movie-goer probably does not appreciate the amount of research and attention to detail that went into the making of this film. As a flight attendant myself I was so quickly taken in by the routine conversations of the flight crew as the preflight inspections take place as they do every day and on every trip. I soon forgot that I was in a movie theater and felt as part of the crew. That is quite impressive in it's own right. All the sights, sounds and even the United flight crew uniforms were so authentic. As the movie progressed, I felt the same panic and anger I felt on that day. And asked the same unanswered question of Why? I think this film even though it was questioned by some to be made too soon, is a very fitting tribute to those who lost their lives. I have always wondered what it would have been like to be on board that flight, what would I have done. I found myself yelling out to the passengers to grab things like fire extinguishers and seat cushions. Then I looked around and remembered I was in a movie theater. I find my self no longer trying to get over and forget about that September day. Now I am mad again, but mad and vigilant. Vigilant to not let this happen again. Not on my airplane.",10,4,8,4 May 2006
