Raiders of the Lost Ark," This movie never lets up
","The opening scene is better than the climax for most action/adventure films out there.  You don't have time to think, but you don't have to.  You can just sit back for the ride.  The best rollercoaster of a film I've seen.",10,0,0,14 August 1998
Fight Club," Brilliant statement of American Culture
","Aside from the what has already been said regarding Fight Club, there are some exceptionally brilliant moments in this movie.  The first 40 minutes are the most intriguing for me.  I especially liked Edward Norton's character and his narration concerning the support groups, insomnia, material posessions, his condo, and his work.  I particularly enjoyed his negotiating with Marla on how to split up the support groups.  When he and Tyler have their first fight there is a pause, and he says, 'Let me tell you something about Tyler Durden.'  Then he goes into this whole thing about the part time jobs which Tyler holds.  That little digression is perhaps one the most brilliant five minutes in film I have seen.  Although this movie really is a 'Dark Comedy' of sorts, there are many socially true statements made. For instance, Tyler saying, 'The things you own end up owning you.' Exactly!  The imagry throughout the film is fantastic.  Apart from the fight sequences, which are well crafted, we have the cave sequences with the power animal...great stuff! And of course that old abandoned house.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt have some of the best on-screen chemistry I have seen.  They blend perfectly.  This is the best chemistry Norton has had with another actor since his work with Matt Damon in Rounders.  Overall, Fight Club approaches a rare perfection.  The dialog and narration are its greatest strengths.  Easily one of the top 5 movies of 1999.",10,0,1,24 June 2000
As Good as It Gets," Nicholson steals the show
","Yes, the story is contrived, not even slightly realistic, nor is it beleivable that Carol the waitress would be in the least bit attracted to Melvin.  However Nicholson turns in one of his most unforgettable performances in years.  His neurotic, self-serving, obsessive compulsive behavior is amazing to watch. His crass comments and facial expressions are brilliantly acted.  I suppose Helen Hunt did the best she could with what she had to work with for her character, but nobody flip-flops that much in one movie.  One minute she hates him, the next she loves him... Yeah, sure the guy is sick and he needs help.  But he's a total jerk!  It must have been a really weak year for female leads for her to have won.  Greg Kinnear deserved to win best supporting actor more than Helen Hunt deserved her best actress award. I also enjoyed the too few scenes with Cuba Gooding, one of the most charismatic young actors going.  Nicholson however carries this thing on his back.  Another well deserved Oscar for Jack!",Null,2,8,6 August 1998
American Beauty," Great Soundtrack by Thomas Newman
","Here, we have a typical case of the music dominating the actual story line. Thomas Newman is a wonderful composer. Anyone who has seen Shawshank Redemption will recognize the haunting and beautiful sounds interwoven throughout the fabric of American Beauty. At times Newman's music is really the only thing holding this film together.  Musically another strong moment is Lester running out of his house while The Who's 'The Seeker' blares.  I love The Who, and any movie containing a rarely played Who powerhouse tune has to get some kudos.  Other than that the movie is mediocre.  It's okay as a comedy of sorts, but there's not a whole lot going on here.  The big message is be thankful for every moment of your life.  Okay, thanks, got it. Best film of the year?  I don't think so.  Best Actor? Sorry Kevin. Actually I think the kid from Sixth Sense should have won best actor.  He really did have a leading role, but they never nominate a kid lead for best actor.  Remember Christian Bale in Empire of the Sun? Didn't get nominated for a thing, and he was absolutely brilliant.  But I digress.  American Beauty will not go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever. I doubt it will be remembered as anything special five years from now.  In short, mediocre.  Good music, though.",5,0,0,30 June 2000
The Usual Suspects," You have to see it several times to really get it
","It's a film that will keep you thinking for months after you've seen it even 2 or 3 times, and then you have to go back and watch it again just to make sure you understand what was real and what wasn't. Amazing.",Null,1,2,14 August 1998
Good Will Hunting," Matt Damon proves how versatile an actor he is
","Damon carries this thing all the way, which is good because after all he plays the title character.  I watched 'The Rainmaker' just before watching 'Good Will Hunting' and I was blown away by the contrast of Damon's characters and the versatility of his acting.  First of all his southern drawl and Boston accent are wonderfully authentic.  This is important to the viewer who has to believe in the character.  Robin Williams would have been more believable if he'd have stuck with his own accent rather than attempting to muddle through one of the worst 'Baastan' accents I've heard. It's distracting listening to him go in and out of it.  This is the only downer in an otherwise brilliant performance; his best serious role since 'Awakenings,' which was a far better performance. Far too little attention has been paid to Stellan Skarsgard's performance.  He is wonderful in his role as the domineering math professor attempting to take Will under his wing.  Skarsgard's dialogue with both Williams and Damon creates some of the more memorable scenes in the movie. Other great performances include Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Casey Affleck. I'd like to include Cole Hauser as Bill in this list, but he barely has three lines in the whole movie.  Over all this film is entertaining, funny, and original. It's refreshing.",Null,0,1,13 September 1998
Schindler's List," Almost the movie Spielberg was destined to make...
","Don't get me wrong, this was a magnificent film, which portrays an accurate picture of the horror and inhumanity of Hitler's Germany.  However, Spielberg still does not make the film he should have made.  Granted Schindler was a hero and a legend for his humanity, although his motives at first were those of profit. Eventually he found his own humanity and redemption.  As a Jewish director Spielberg felt obligated to make a Holocaust film.  Why he didn't make a film focusing on one or more Jewish families struggling to survive is beyond me.  As the son of Holocaust survivors I have heard first-hand accounts of the unique struggles and tortures endured, and every story I've heard is touching, horrifying and wrenching.  One day a powerful Hollywood director is going to make a real Holocaust film.  It may not be Spielberg, but someone will.  It is also possible that Schindler's List is the closest thing Hollywood will permit to portraying the graphic horror of the Holocaust.  I still remain hopeful. Steven Spielberg is one of the most amazing directors ever and deserves a great deal of credit.",Null,9,13,16 August 1998
Meet Joe Black," Great concept, a tad long.
","I liked the idea, but I think they could have cut certain scenes down considerably, saved time, and still have made this film impactful.  For instance didn't the scene in the study when Bill first sees Joe kind of drag on just a little too long?  Maybe I'm a little impatient, but I kept thinking, 'Okay okay, we get it! Let's move it along!'  In fact this holds true for many scenes, including that first family dinner scene with Joe. They could have wrapped up this movie in a nice, tidy 2 hours without losing any of the emotional qualities.  As far as the ending, didn't Brad Pitt seem like he was having a few problems believing his own lines.  I thought I saw him struggling to maintain a straight face while saying something to the effect of, 'Well, I don't really know what happened after the coffee shop, but hey!  Looks like you got a nifty little party going on...'  Me?  I guess I'd be just a tad more disoriented and just a smidgen more incredulous as to how one minute I'm in a coffee shop with the woman of my dreams, and then suddenly I'm standing with her at a groovy soiree dressed in a tux.  But hey, that's me. I guess I'm funny that way.  Brad just seems to go with the flow on that one.  And how about Susan.  She seems to accept the death thing pretty well.  I mean her father disappears over a hill with some guy she falls in love with who just happens to be death, right?  Then the guy comes back alone, and all she can say is, 'I wish you could have known my father. C'mon, lets party.' And off they go hand in hand.  I really did like this film, however.  There is an undeniable emotional quality, especially during the scene with Bill and Susan near the end.  A little long, however. Ridiculous in certain parts.",Null,0,0,18 May 1999
Donnie Brasco," An amazing true story
","Until Joe Pistone went undercover and penetrated deeply into the mafia, there was no such thing as long-term undercover assignments in the FBI.  He and his supervisors had to make it up as they went.  Depp proves how talented and versatile he is in the title role, but the real star of this one is Al Pacino playing Lefty Ruggiero, an aging mafia soldier who is worn an bitter from being passed over time and time again for advancement within the family.  Michael Madsen as Sonny Black is the best bad guy in film today.  He has that John Wayne quality going for him in this one.  Who could forget his equally stunning performance in Resevoire Dogs.  After watching Donnie Brasco for the fourth time I got the book.  As in most cases the movie fails to surpass the book, but it does better than most.",Null,0,0,16 September 1998
Groundhog Day," Simply delightful
","Bill Murray was born to play Phil.  I have never seen him more at ease and natural than in Groundhog Day.  The great thing about this one is it's not just another redemption film where the main character changes his ways based upon one single event. For instance in Good Will Hunting we are led to believe that Will is a whole new person based upon a few counseling sessions. We don't know for sure, but it might have taken Phil years of reliving the same day to get it right.  It's so much fun watching Bill Murray's character change and evolve, and the scene in which he quotes Chekhov is touching and memorable.  Ironically Bill Murray plays the main character in Scrooged, another tale of redemption that couldn't come close to Groundhog Day in terms of originality, script, and imagination. Groundhog day, however, is Bill Murray's best performance to date.",10,1,2,22 September 1998
Pulp Fiction," Quentin Tarantino creates a masterpiece.
","Pulp Fiction.  The opening of this film consists of a literary definition of the title.  This alone should tell you what you are about to see cannot be compared to anything real.  But have you listened to the news or read the papers lately.  There's stuff going on the world that makes Pulp Fiction look like a day care center complete with cute bunnies.  Tarantino specializes in introducing us to characters, allowing us to get use to them, and he even getting us to like them.  Then all of a sudden he introduces an element that is so bizarre we barely have time to process it.  He doesn't give us time for it to sink in, but we still have to deal with this new direction while more stuff keeps happening.  The language, drug use, and violence are all incidental.  They are not 'Glorified' by this movie.  If you make a movie about modern day gangsters in L.A. or any city, drugs and violence go hand in hand with it for it to be realistic in that respect.  I get the feeling Tarantino wants us to believe in the characters, dialogue, and overall initial premise.  Then he throws a monkey wrench into the works. How we react tells us a lot about ourselves. This is not my favorite movie ever, but it's definitely in my top 10.  I love the fact that there are as many people who love this movie as those who hate it.  That alone is a difficult achievement.",Null,1,2,28 September 1998
Inception," Flawed But Pretty Nifty
","I actually liked this film a lot; I like Christopher Nolan's stuff. 'Memento' was stellar. And although there are many plot holes, contradictions, and other bits of carelessness in the filmmaking process, it's still a visually stunning experience -- one that led me to watch it several times. Also, it helps to turn on the DVD's subtitles in order to discern what the heck Saito is saying during several key scenes.I didn't get too hung up on trivial inconsistencies because the movie moves along at a lively pace. To paraphrase Ariadne, it's more about the feel.OK, so if you're in the middle of a dream, and 'an extremely powerful sedative' is being used, you end up in limbo if you get killed. However, because Yusuf tailored the sedative to leave inner ear function unimpaired, the falling-to-your-death sensation will still wake you up even if you're many layers deep. So why didn't they just drop Saito if they were worried about losing him to limbo? Oh, and if you've never been in limbo before, you automatically end up in the infinite depths of the subconscious world of one of your co-dreamers who might've been there before. In other words, let's just make stuff up and call it good.Nevertheless, 'Inception' is still a nifty flick with plenty of cool visuals to keep you interested. It's a fun ride.",8,2,12,8 February 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," The closest thing to poetic perfection Hollywood has ever produced
","This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean, nor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be.",10,42,62,2 August 1998
