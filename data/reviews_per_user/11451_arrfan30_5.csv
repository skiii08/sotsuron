Captain Phillips," A Stunning Movie
","The film is about the hijack of a ship named 'Maersk Alabama' headed by Captain Richard Phillips. The film starts at a slow pace.The role of Captain Phillips portrayed by Tom Hanks who's one of the best actors in Hollywood, is depicted very well. The fear of the Somalian Pirates travels around the crew members in a gradual manner but one can see the tension steadily rising with the Captain Phillips who orders a security drill just in case. Two skiffs of pirates start out towards the ship but one heads back believing the false alarm raised by the Captain. The other skiff with 4 pirates advances.Once the pirates come on board after a little struggle, Captain does everything to keep the crew members out of sight leaving out himself and couple of other guys to the pirates.The fragile bond between the Pirate Lead 'Muse' and Hanks starts there which would go long way in the film. This is where the film increases its pace and moves on.Tom Hanks would nail any character and that's well known to everyone but the role of Pirate Lead played by Barkhad Abdi is so intriguing and natural. The role fits him very well and also made him get nominated for the Oscars,BAFTA,Golden Globe under the category of 'Best Supporting Actor'. Hanks has done a great job in bringing out the fear and tension that surrounds him in each and every situation of confrontation. The aftermath of the hostage situation is where Hanks gets to prove his real talent of acting. The screenplay could have been better and there were situations that needed sharp rise. The climax might have been a bit short but nonetheless, it maintained the grip. The reaction of the ship's crew once the Captain is taken off could have been enhanced. The bridge between the first half and second half should have been better cause one tends to forget the fact that the Pirates came for the ship and took the Captain as an accident implying the fact that it focuses more on the hostage situations in the 'Life Boat' involving Hanks and the pirates.Overall verdict : Captain Phillips is DEFINITELY worth a watch.",8,2,4,17 January 2014
Southpaw," Southpaw - Life and Soul of Billy 'The Great' Hope !
","Not often we get to see the 'Rise-Fall-Rise' story in any genre. Southpaw gives us just that. This is a film filled with emotions,love and the fierce 'Southpaw' of Jake Gyllenhaal. The versatility that Gyllenhaal gives us with each film is truly amazing. 'Nightcrawler' - Gyllenhaal's previous outing was filled with surprises in the note of the film and the character portrayed by Gyllenhaal. He has put his life and soul into this film and his transformation for Billy 'The Great' Hope. This film deals with a boxer who is high on his career and watches the world crumble around him when he loses his wife played by Rachel McAdams who has done what she was intended to do, no more; no less. The initial scenes in the film makes the viewer understand the fact that Jake is a loose cannon, so when he loses his wife; he does exactly what a loose cannon would do. Fire in all directions !! And then when he realizes that he's losing his daughter, the real fight begins. The fight which would define the climax of the film which could've been a bit more dramatic is the one thing where 'Southpaw' comes in. Frankly speaking, this film has all the ingredients of a good movie to watch but it does not reach 'No man's land' thereby saying that the we cannot find anything new in this film but still it gives us its best and it does what it was intended to. 'Entertain !!'. I have become a great fan of Jake Gyllenhaal,thanks to 'Prisoners' which paved the way for my likeness towards Jake and 'Southpaw' has made it official. No one can see this film and turn away from Gyllenhaal's mind blowing portrayal of Billy Hope. I would definitely give this film a 7/10 and 6 would be credited to Jake Gyllenhaal. Hats off the one of the great actor of our time.",7,0,0,11 September 2015
Everest," Less appealing,Very Slippery but definitely watchable..
","When someone takes a story like this which is based upon true events, there has to be a lot of emotions to justify the characters in it and to make people believe that its a true story. The film started off well explaining the characters a bit slowly but as time moved on and as more characters dropped in, the grip of the film started losing a bit and it ultimately failed to lose it till the end. I,for one strongly felt that the director has strongly failed in making use of the enormous cast given to him. The roles of Jake,Emily and Robin were such a waste which could've been given to any other small time actors because they ultimately failed to create any impact in the film. I felt the same even about Keira, these characters could've been given more importance or could've been attributed to more scenes. Simon Beaufoy has done a great job in screenplay like his previous outings. The cinematography in the film definitely has to be given the top rank with its breathtaking shots and numerous close ups without making it look weird. On the musical front, there has been some justification but one cant find any grand music in the scenes involving Everest Summit which can be a disappointment to some people. Jason has done a good job with acting and has given exactly what was expected of him. The final verdict from someone who watches a lot of films in various genres would definitely be 'Slippery but decent'. Boasting with such a cast, one would definitely be forced to expect more but not of all our expectations will be fulfilled. The film had emotional scenes running through out the film but it was just displayed in the screen and it did not reach me even though I was sitting very close to the screen. I sincerely hope that this film will not be taken to Oscars. My personal rating to this film would be 6/10.",6,1,3,18 September 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Aversive ! Juiceless ! Stony !
","I have been waiting for this film since the announcement and I was so eagerly waiting for this film for so long but I was highly disappointed to see the film. I am an avid fan of Superman and I have to hand it over to Snyder to have increased the class for Superman in Man of Steel and that film was really good,I would not dare to use the word 'Great' but it had its share of fun and super-heroness !! Bryan couldn't visualize Superman like Snyder and 'Superman Returns' was good but not really good. Zack gave a good look and feel to Superman in Man of Steel and it kinda paid off and earned him the director seat for this legendary film and I would say that he did a good job in directing but the screenplay was kinda off and that counts a lot for a film of this magnitude. Majority of the people were highly influenced by the darker and more sleekier Nolan's version of Batman. He RE-DEFINED Batman using his most innovative and creative ideas and that paid off BIG time and that could have been evident why people started hating Affleck when he was cast as Batman in this film. Nolan gave us a trilogy no director could dream about and audiences were stuck to Bale as Batman so Snyder should have felt the responsibility to break the view as far he could cause he cant re- write history but he could try making one and he failed AGAIN.. I personally felt that the there was not enough steam and the build-up around Batman, he was not able to establish the new Batman firmly on our mind and when we come to our senses about understanding this new Batman brought in front of us, Eisenberg jumps right in trying to act all psychotic and I am not even sure whether I found it appealing, it was kinda difficult to judge. Cavill doesn't do much as usual and sticks to what he's good at,he flies, speaks less words and stands tall with his amazing fit body. Affleck had so much at stake in this film and on its success but he was let down by Snyder. Basically, the film did not have time to establish a strong character for Batman but Superman had a good or decent prequel as Man of Steel so we knew what to expect of him but we had no idea about Affleck and his portrayal of Batman and I believe that was a serious mistake in the film which DID NOT help the viewers to justify the whole point of action. The viewer could hardly feel the presence of Wonder Woman but if that's how it was meant to be then its a great success. I heartily wish that Snyder chooses a more appropriate character for the role of an antagonist in the forth coming Justice League series. The movie does not fail much in the sense of entertainment but I believe that people expected more than entertainment, they wanted their dreams to come true when two of the most well-known super heroes face each other but their dreams were shattered at the least because this is not the story of some amateur superhero like Kick-Ass where you are meant only to entertain !!There's a way to enjoy this film, all you have to do is Forget Nolan-Bale, I am damn well sure that nobody remembers Singer-Routh. DO NOT EXPECT A GREAT MOVIE ! EXPECT TO BE ENTERTAINED BY A GREAT Hollywood MOVIE WITH ALL THE WORLD-CLASS ACTION YOU COULD GET !!",7,0,3,26 March 2016
The Martian," The Martian - 500 Days of Mars !!
","'The Martian' - a film about a man who gets stranded in Mars waiting for rescue from Earth. Matt Damon depicts the role of Mark Watney, a Botanist cum Astronaut. Filled with humour, Matt has done a great job in acting as always. He justifies his role as a lonely guy in a planet, but the scenes where he is shown in Mars did not give us a complete depth that he was alone,implying that Scott has done it necessarily thereby reducing the sensitive part of loneliness or at least I presume so. A great attempt at that,which can truly be appreciated. The pace of the film was always good, there are some scenes in the second half which will test your patience but none the less, they will be forgotten along the film. On the note of acting, I personally couldn't find any of the character's acting extraordinary. Each and every character did what they intended to but they also stick to our mind at the end of the film so none of the characters can necessarily be said as wasted.Matt can be given the thumbs up for acting because it didn't look like he was pushing himself to give the best performance, it was with ease with which he gives us the role. Scott, one of the most renowned directors before certain years definitely deserves this film as to be his comeback. I have seen a lot of Scott's film, he's a master in giving us a commercial flick but at the same time filled with all the vital elements that should reside in a GREAT film. 'The Martian' can definitely be considered as one of the good films that got released this year. Bottomline, this is a good film which gives a average movie-goer all he wants but this cannot be considered as a GREAT film as this has only shades of it. A Good one by Scott after a long time !!",7,2,5,16 October 2015
