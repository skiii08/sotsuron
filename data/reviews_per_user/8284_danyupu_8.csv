The Avengers," Masterpiece
","what was that ? i went to this movie last night with high hopes and great expectations ... and i was right , in fact this movie exceeds all expectations , i will not spoil anything here , and i really don't know where to start , Marvel in its best suite ever , finally they did it , they gathered them in one freaking movie , THE AVENGERS , i used to watch each one of them alone ( or perhaps some of them together in the animated movies ) , but to watch this movie with this cast :-) am still impressed . never thought they would make this movie like that way , they made it for the ages i guess , the cast was perfect and everyone knew what he will do and knew his rule ... there were some funny moments in the movie which everyone in the theater was laughing loudly at . action scenes were perfectly made , top notch in fact , every single shot in the movie counts , every single shot was perfectly made . i really loved the assembly of the cast together , Robert Downy JR. STILL HAS IT , the whole cast is perfect ... WATCH THIS MOVIE , YOU WILL BE SATISFIED ... I gave it 9 out of 10 WATCH AND FEEL FREE TO WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN , YOU WILL LOVE IT",9,2,6,6 May 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," very good ... but .... !!!
","this movie has something in it .. something good , yet still mysterious ... let's see , first of all as you should know , this is not an accurate history movie , it is a mix of true historical events and mythical events ... the only thing that i take on the writer is trying to convince us that this is true events all the time ( which appears in making Abraham GROW OLDER through out the movie after being the vampire hunter they claim ) , now to the movie , it is a well made movie , sound effects and graphics are well done , the music is very very good , the action scenes and fights are super , i really enjoyed them , some fright moments and horror scenes that are well combined to achieve the goal , this is a very good horror movie ,,, the actin yet stands good , not bad not excellent , simply good , and ( Benjamin Walker ) reminds me of the great ( Liam Neeson )in all aspects , overall i recommend this movie to you , go watch it and take some pop corn with you , you will like it :-) 7 out of 10 , cause the writer did a simple good job .",7,5,10,23 June 2012
World War Z," mean while in zombie land
","new zombie movie ? nothing new ... it reminds me of an old movie where a monkey spread-ed a virus and the hero was trying to find the cure . this is not a bad movie if you ask me , it has something new , something unusual , and while Brad Pitt on board , you have to say it is a good movie , still in a good shape and an action movie star as usual . the plot was weak and the pace was fast and this is what made it bearable . there are some good things in the movie that made me say it is not a bad movie , in brief , Brad Pitt , Good sound Effects , good zombie action scenes , perhaps this is why i gave it 7 out of 10 . if you are looking for something new , you should give this movie a try , or perhaps if you want to spend some time doing something new :-)",7,0,8,26 June 2013
Man of Steel," best of the best
","just watched this movie for the second time ... the first words out of my mouth after watching it is ( is it me or Hollywood is getting more and more better ? ) .forget the old Superman Movies , this movie is a must see , everything in its right place , the acting , the cast , the sound effects , all have done a wonderful combination to bring this movie into the light . whole new story with a whole new action scenes , with a brilliant cast combined together . 8 out of 10 , and watch it if you got the chance :-) put it up , suite up and have some popcorn , 2 hours and 20 minutes of joyful thrill in your way , buckle up and enjoy the ride ... don't miss it in 3D :-)",8,2,6,26 June 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," 2 to go and 3 to come
","i think that every thing i will say will not make a difference , you know the director , the cast and the story . but what am gonna say is that , am impressed , i missed the first part and didn't have the chance to see it on theater , but i saw it on blu-ray , and when i went to the theaters to watch the second part i had high hopes and i was RIGHT , Peter Jackson made it again , but with more thrilling adventure and with a way better cast. Orland Bloom returns in his best , Evangeline Lilly with her really stunning smile , and of course the great Ian McKellen . they made up an excellent combination , and the fight scenes are beyond expectations . don't miss the chance to see it on 3D, you will have a very very good time , and am sure you will enjoy it . 8 out of 10 cause there were some moment where i thought they were just filling the time , overall the movie is superb .",8,0,1,23 December 2013
Thor," loved it so much
","first of all , am a big big fan of the character (Thor) , i had to watch the movie in theaters and download it from the internet ... in fact i have seen the movie about (10) times since it was first released .OK , let's settle down for a minute ... Visual Effects are great and a top notch as you may say ... the characters are well played with a great cast , the only thing that disappointed me is that the movie is not long enough for me ... they should make it at least 2.30 hours .and i really wished there could be more villains for (Thor) to fight . but the good news is ... it's coming again in ( the avengers ) ... :-)8 out of 10 , not because there is something wrong in the movie , but they should have made it 3 hours if they needed 10 out of 10",8,1,2,28 November 2011
Dark Shadows," shocked :-((
","i saw this movie three days ago and i had high expectations for the names of (Johnny Depp & Tim Burton ) have a ringing name in my ears , and i was disappointed .. the movie was too naive , the story was hollow and the acting was poor , Johnny Depp was the only one who knew how to play their rule , all other were missed up and was wondering out through the movie without a clue :-( , i really expected much of this movie ... Tim Burton Returns in a very very bad movie , i thought it would be better with Johnny Depp on board . am still mad at them both for doing such a bad movie , the only good thing in this movie ( which could be boring to others ) is the music and songs for the early 70th , i really enjoyed it and this with the acting of Johnny Depp Is the only reason i rate this movie 6 out of 10 , without them (music & Depp) I could of rated this movies with a solid 4 or 3 maximum ... wait till it is on DVD or go to theater if you feel bored and want to do anything but sitting home .",6,0,0,19 May 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," awesome :-)
","watched this movie yesterday , i've seen both two earlier parts and i loved them , the idea of friendship and the journey they take with each others to achieve their dreams ... but this part , this part is different , it is amazing and well made movie . the 3D effects are awesome and the colors are really splendid . the only thing that is not there is time , i wish they could of made this movie a little big longer maybe 2 or 2.30 hours . still in love with the part of ( king Julien ) , though they forgot to make him dance :-) ,the whole cast was amazing too ... this movie has a really wonderful moments , the very first moment i came out of the theater , i turned to my brother and said , well we must watch it again ... if you have the chance to go to the theaters and watch this movie , DO NOT miss it , go and watch and you will not be disappointed ... take your children with you , they WILL love it too :-)",8,1,2,20 June 2012
