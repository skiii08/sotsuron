Hereditary," This should be called...Crapatary
","If you want to sleep at night, then you should watch this movie. Soooo boring, i almost half of the movie fall asleep watching this. Its like theres nothing that scary to me, i only appraise the special effect, acting and direction, but the script and storyline i should give zero ratings and throw it away to the trash bin.",2,7,13,15 May 2019
Aquaman," Overall High Quality Except The SFX
","I dont like the special effect use in this films.why??? Because its sooo ecessive until you cannot differ between the 'live-action' and 'animated', it is indeed tooo muchh muchh sfx. God, i feel every scene in the movie too bright it hurts my eyes. Nevertheless, the storyline, chemistry between actor/actress are should be praised of because it was directed by james wan. Please for sequel, can you reduce the usage of sfx?",8,2,4,5 June 2019
Interstellar," Not One, But The Best Science Fiction Ever
","Brilliant, riveting, genius all that together blended and boom produce this movie. A balance between science with a little bit of emotional drama, telling the story of how can we save humanity by against all impossible or beyond obstacles like the family love, the time, the wormhole, the space to find a resource from another universe. Abrilliant performance from matthew and all other casts, making this movie more entertaint and awing us more. Thanks a lot to christopher nolan for making this masterpiece.",10,2,3,17 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Something Kinda Off
","Giving 7 stars only means the storyline looks off, or not incredible enough. I get the feeling this is gonna last, but some closure are not clear enough for instance a relationship between Rey and Finn, and looks like were never gonna find about 'what is it you gonna say?', hmmm never get that answers anymore. After all, you cant deny their performance but well it seems this last movie does not attract me enough, im feeling decent, maybe because theres no avengers anymore???",7,1,9,8 January 2020
Midsommar," If You Like 'EDEN LAKE' and 'WICKER MAN' WATCH THIS
","I warned all of you, if you DONT want to see bad guy wins at the end, PLEASE do not watch this. As it make you feel wanted to vomit, as you feel there's no justice at all, not fair, but that's feeling what makes this film success, it capture my heart, to symphatises with our main character, where there are becoming sacrifice of some old gory tradition. Its just like, THE WICKER MAN and EDEN LAKE. at the peak of the plotline, I already know that these movies has a similarities. So, people with weak heart do not watch this. I warned you.",7,0,2,17 October 2019
Life," Could be better
","But no. I hope the story could get better, no do not get your hope because you will not like the ending. Why most movie always make a hanging ending. Could it get sequel? No i dont think so. An ending that left with many question? Did calvin survive? Will people on earth kill calvin? I dont like this movie ending at all. Unless they make a sequel. Other than that...meh not for me to remember it, watch once then im done.",5,1,1,11 June 2019
