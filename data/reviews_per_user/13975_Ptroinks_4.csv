Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not good, not good at all...
","I'm a Star Wars fan, just so that we have that fact established. I have loved the Star Wars movies since the first time I saw them, and they're great. Except for 'The Phantom Menace'. This is a movie that hardly makes it as a part of the Star Wars saga. Lucas appears to have made this film in a hurry. There weren't many parts of this film which could not have been better. As an overview, I could say that most of the story, parts of the acting, and too many of the visual effect shots could, and should, have been better.Basically, everything goes wrong from the start. You are never properly introduced to Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, so you never really feel attached to them.George Lucas should have considered dropping some of the Gungan and Jar-Jar Binks-scenes in advantage for letting us get to know the characters better. The Gungans worked poorly as 'Ewok-wannabe's'.What's up with the technology? On a little planet in the outer rim, around 50 years before the events of 'A New Hope', they have really shiny, aerodynamic spaceships with displays far more advanced than any of the starfighters of the battle of Yavin. They have Destroyer-droids with shield-generators (even the Galactic Empire had no droids with shield-generators), and most annoying of all: Darth Maul's spaceship has a cloaking device (not revealed in the film, but still...). When the Millenium Falcon disappears from the scopes of the Star Destroyer Avenger, 50 years after Episode I, captain Needa clearly says that 'no ship that small(!) has a cloaking device). The Millenium Falcon is at least twice as big as the Sith Infiltrator, and still, someone managed to fit a cloaking device into the Infiltrator. Weird!!!George, please drop the Anakin Skywalker-- Jesus Christ comparison... -----------------------From all the bad to some of the good (but it's not much): Jake Lloyd does a great job as Anakin Skywalker. So does Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson (but they've always been great in their work). The effects were stunning, and the duel between Obi-Wan\Qui-Gon and Darth Maul was incredible. And of course, John Williams' score is, as always, magnificent.Well, I think I've said enough for now. There was a lot of bad things in this film, but I have to admit that it was an entertaining movie to see. But as a Star Wars-fan... well, just start from the top.",2,0,1,28 August 1999
Spider-Man," Real actors and sets vs. CGI...
","I had kind of high expectations of this movie, and after I saw it, I couldn't stop being puzzled by the poor way computer graphics were used in the film. Yes, a lot of the scenes in the film required some kind of special effects-use (and some actually required the entire shot to be CGI), but to this degree? I don't think so. Just about ALL of the scenes including Spider-Man (as Spider-Man, not Peter Parker) were CGI. And that's OK, I guess, but ONLY if it looks real! By using some sort of mix between using the actor on a blue-screen and CGI, in stead of ONLY using CGI, I think the results would have been much better.If I had brought a pen and some paper with me, I'm pretty sure I could have spotted at least 80-90% of the scenes\shots where computer graphics were used. In particular, I'd like to mention the scene (SMALL SPOILER AHEAD!!!) just after Peter Parker discovers his new 'gift'. He's running and jumping from roof to roof, and in that entire sequence, there's no Tobey Maguire on screen. It's all CGI, and it's all too visible. The point of CGI (in my opinion) is to help make a scene more interesting and dramatic to tell the story better, but in order to do so, the CGI-usage must be believable. There were a few times, as I watched the movie, where I thought that this should be in a computer game, not in a film. Altogether, the bad CGI in this movie ruined the experience for me. In a computer game, you can get away with it. But not on the big-screen.",4,0,0,2 July 2002
Contact," One of the most absorbing and good movies I have ever seen.
","This film is one of the few I can see again and again without getting tired of it. When I saw it for the first time in a cinema, I didn't leave until the credits had finished because I was so stunned by it. I've seen it quite a few times after that, and I think it's just as good as the first time I saw it. Of course, after seeing a movie a number of times, you know what's coming next when you see it, but still...",8,3,7,3 May 1999
The Island," Michael Bay does 'it' again!
","I didn't know much about this movie before I saw it (I only saw a short teaser once), not even the cast, but I did know that it was a science fiction movie, and being a sci-fi fan, I really looked forward to it. As I sat in my seat at the local cinema, the smile on my mouth was soon turned into a frown when I noticed the text 'A Michael Bay film' (or something like that) in the opening credits. That was a big 'uh-oh' for me because it seems he has a bad habit of trading story for action. Sure, I enjoy a good action movie, but not when the story goes out the window because the director thinks good pyrotechnics and digital effects can satisfy moviegoers just as well as a good story can. I'm not going to spoil anything at all here, so all I'm going to say to those who are considering seeing this film is: This script had the potential for greatness, but a lot of disappointing scenes in 'The Island' makes me give it a 4 out of 10. Yes, this is a sci-fi movie, and I guess a lot of what I consider to be mistakes can be excused just because of that. But I think a really good sci-fi movie manages to 'teach' the audience the movie's definition of reality, and that allows us to get more caught-up in the story. 'The Island' has quite a couple of scenes in it (I won't spoil anything, relax!) where I just shook my head in disbelief. It was just as if watching these scenes abruptly pulled me away from the tension in them and got me stuck in a 'reality mode'. And for a sci-fi fan, the 'reality mode' is not very much fun... For those of you who are thinking 'OK, I'm not going to see this film', not seeing it is probably just as good if you get as disappointed as me when you see a good script getting wasted. But I think a part of me still wants to recommend this film, because despite all its drawbacks, it's still a kind of story you don't see every day, and at times, it can be surprising and really exciting! What you've just read is just my personal opinion (if anyone was wondering). There are as many movie tastes around as there are people, so for all I know, I might be the only one who got a kind of bad feeling walking out of the cinema as the end credits rolled by.",4,2,4,17 August 2005
