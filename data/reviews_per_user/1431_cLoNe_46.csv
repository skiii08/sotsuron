The Devil's Advocate," Shockingly good!
",This movie took me by surprise. I was at a friend's house and this movie was rented so I watched it because I had nothing better to do.Wham! The movie sucked me in into the plot right away and I loved every spooky moment of it. After 'Dolores Claiborne' and this movie Taylor Hackford became one of my favorite directors.The next paragraph is almost a *SPOILER* so read it at your own decision:The only bad thing in this movie is the cheesy horror movie twist ending at the very last second. You'll see what I mean.,9,2,2,26 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Boriiing!
","I was horrified when I watched this movie. Horrified that such a boring, stale movie could be so popular. The idea of not showing the horror and letting the audience imagine it was not done well. There was just not enough to work up my imagination. What I did see was unbelievable and silly.    I sticked around with the horrible 'artistic' shots, hoping that the climax will be better, but there's no climax. The movie just ends... At least it ends...",1,10,18,14 January 2001
Alien 3," Why? No! EEK!
","I hated this movie. It was ok as A movie, but not as a part of the series. It just seemed wrong. I won't spoil it to anyone, but it really ruined the previous movie 'Aliens'.We are back to one Alien, which is quite annoying after we were 'Spoiled' with hundreds of aliens in 'Aliens'... The movie just feels cold and wrong... I dunno. It does have some nice moment though.",7,4,5,13 August 1999
Gremlins," One of my favorite movies of all times!
","Well, it's my favorite because I saw it as a little kid over and over again and loved every second! As an adult I still love it and it's a great example of mixing a thriller with comedy without having one taking from the other. Gizmo is one of the cutest fictional creatures ever and the Gremlins are just hilarious. The movie is also touching at some points, unlike the silly sequel. What I'm trying to say is, that this is a great movie and if you didn't see it yet GO AND BUY IT!",Null,0,1,23 July 1999
Antz," Incredible animation. Good story.
","The animation in this movie is simply amazing and The all-star voice cast is doing a great job with the witty and clever script. The characters are not 'cute' like the Disney/Pixar stuff, but that's not necessarily a plus.The biggest competition to this movie is 'Bug's life'. I prefer 'Bug's life' because it's a little lighter, but both films are simply great for kids and adults.",9,0,1,14 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A classic reborn.
","Wow. I loved that movie! The special effects are much better than the ones in the first trilogy (duh- 20 more years for them to develop) and it's absolutely wonderful. Colorful scenes that range from an underwater city, races in the desert to amazing kingdoms. The story is also great and the prequel in-jokes and plot points are perfect. Can't wait to see Episode 2 and 3! I had a small problem with the all-star cast, but it wasn't that bad. I'm sure the movie would be just as successful with new faces. But what the heck?",10,0,1,4 August 1999
Mulan," Another great Disney movie!
","The thing I like about the Disney movies is that they all feel the same and totally different at the same time.Mulan feels very authentic, as much as I could tell, and the story was fun. The songs weren't as good as the Alan Menken and Howard Ashman songs(Little Mermaid, Aladdin and more), but they were pretty nice.The story was interesting and the action scenes were fun, even though in some bits they were a little over the top.",9,2,2,6 August 1999
Unbreakable," A bit slow, but has quite a few good moments.
","When talking about this movie, it's hard to avoid a comparison to the Sixth Sense, because of the same team of director/writer-lead actor.But the fact is, it's a pretty different movie with a whole different theme. I thought the movie was slightly too slow paced, but there were quite a few moments in the movie that I liked. Some were funny, some were dramatic and some were thrilling.It's yet another good movie with a cool twist from Mr. Shyamalan who excels in creating touching and moving moments in unusual situations.",8,0,0,11 February 2001
Alien: Resurrection," Back on track!
","The action element is back to the Alien series! This movie is packed with action, thrills, scares and awesome special effects.The story is also cool, especially the ending with the new... Err... Nope, I'm not gonna spoil it to you, but believe me, it's so cool..!Weaver is brilliant in her role as the clone of Ripley and her character's inner conflict adds a lot to the suspense and mayhem around. I hope this movie will be followed up by an equally well done sequel.",8,0,0,13 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Hilarious and very smart!
","This movie is actually pretty smart, but the fart jokes attracted all kinds of people... I had some burping Americans sitting behind me so I had to move... To sit behind drunk dutchs... Fun.The movie had lots of sharp wisdom between the farts and cursing. A really clever parody!Of course the silly bitch sitting behind me had to shriek and repeat unimportant lines and was really upset when I informed her she's a bitch. Oh well. That's what happens when you go to see South Park at the cinema. I think watching it at home with friends will be much more fun. A great movie indeed! If you like the TV series you'll no doubt like the movie as well. It really is bigger, longer and uncut... Really!",Null,0,0,29 August 1999
The Mummy," What a great adventure!
","I'm a big fan of horror, so I was a little disappointed to find out it wasn't really a horror movie. It's a lot more like an Indiana Jones movie.The special effects are wonderful and the fast paced action is pure fun. Thrills follow thrills up to an exciting climax with CGI galore!But that's about it: A collection of thrills as the actual characters don't really develop much and the plot is quite simple, but I just didn't care. It supplied more than enough summer entertainment for me!",10,2,2,8 August 1999
X-Men," A great adaptation for the comic book.
","As a comic fan I don't really like the X-Men books. I used to like the classic stories, but not the current stuff. From that point of view I LOVED THE MOVIE. Though it featured some of the modern characters, it was loyal to the classic theme. The new costumes looked good and the cast was superb. Nice action scenes, decent plot. A great popcorn movie.",10,0,0,13 January 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Jedi is back!!! YAY!
","The trilogy is going out with a bang. Lots of special effects, cool characters, soapy drama, dramatic revelations and a titanic climax makes this movie the best one in the classic trilogy. It's the kind of movie that make you gonna go: 'Oh no, it's over!', but have no fear: Episode 1 is here! Buy the entire special edition trilogy and count the minutes for the day we could buy the second trilogy on video as well and have crazy Star Wars 1-6 marathons! Amen.",9,1,2,4 August 1999
Alien," A great thriller!
","Like many other movies that are a first in a series, this movie strongest point is the suspense around the 'mysterious villain'. (like in 'Child's Play' and 'Nightmare On Elm Street') So it doesn't work as well if you see it after watching other Alien movies.But other then a long built up, there is still plenty of action and gore to keep the average horror fan happy. Especially the first infamous chest bursting scene... Absolutely classic!The Alien monster design is just classic and there's no wonder there are so many sequels and a comic book... You just can't have enough of that spooky smooth creature!",9,0,1,13 August 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Funny, witty and enjoyable.
","Once more we get the typical teen summer movie... Don't let the name confuse you, there's not THAT much hate in this movie. Though it's not too original in concept, it does bring some nice original scenes to the well known formula of teen flicks.An all star talented cast make this movie fun to watch, even though you can almost guess what's going to happen next - most of the time. For some strange reason it didn't bother me at all, I just enjoyed the movie..!",8,0,0,12 August 1999
American Pie," Hilarious! BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
","This movie is lots of fun. It has some offensive jokes in it... VERY OFFENSIVE, but it makes up for it with some romantic scenes as well.The movie is wild and over top with lots of original moments. The best thing about this movie that it's repecting the characters and lets them develop to good and decent people.A very nice feel-good movie. Better watch it with friends.",9,12,15,1 November 1999
Pitch Black," A good monster movie
","I'll start with a complaint: the flickering in the opening scene were unbearable and a friend of mine ACTUALLY WALKED OUT! It was indeed annoying and painful to the eye. The actual movie is a fun monster movie where a group of people attempts to escape nasty creatures who want them dead. Sounds familiar? Yep: Aliens, Tremors,Critters, Mimic, Deep Blue Sea... We've seen it before. But it's still fun. The movie features interesting characters with interesting conflicts that add some depth to the movie, but it is still just a monster movie. A good one!",10,0,0,14 January 2001
Aliens," Much more action than in the first one. Bigger body count too. Cool.
","We already know the alien, so there's no need for a big build up. But while it was one puny alien in the first movie, this time we have hundreds!This movie has a big 'action movie' element in it and it mixes well with the suspense and horror. A great exciting ride that has many more thrills than the first movie, especially the cool climax. My favorite movie in the series so far.",10,1,2,13 August 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," The worst in the series, but still a fun movie.
","The Lost World has some really great suspenseful scenes in it and fantastic dinosaurs effects. That alone makes it worth seeing. It also has tons of flaws. Mostly annoying flaws.   The violence and horror are even more toned down from the first movie to an unrealistic level and the movie is flooded with plot devices, especially the forced and clumsy attempt to set up a scene where *spoilers* -------- a T-Rex goes on a rampage in a city.   It is definitely worth viewing for the plenty of great thrills in this movie, but a great movie it is not.",8,0,0,22 July 2001
The Little Mermaid," An incredibly romantic movie!
","Yeah, yeah... It's the little mermaid, the same cute barbie-like character little girls love so much... But the movie is great. If you just free yourself from the sissy pink image of the movie you're in for a treat.The songs are great, by the same team who gave us Little Shop Of Horrors: Alan Menken and Howard Ashman who teamed up in Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin as well. Aladdin was their last project together with Ashman's untimely death from AIDS in 1991.The story is funny and romantic, so who cares if it's not following the original tale? A perfect movie for everyone, not just little girls.",10,68,81,6 August 1999
The Game," A game? I prefer Monopoly...
","All through the movie we have the 'edge of the seat' suspense of 'is this for real or part of the game?'. The movie gets more and more wild and less and less believable that it made me lose interest and just wait for it to over. The climax was even worse and made me roll my eyes over and over again 'till I got dizzy.A game? Ok, a boring stupid game.",1,33,66,5 August 1999
The Evil Dead," Not as good as EVIL DEAD 2, but a MUST for horror fans!
","No CGI effects in this movie, but you don't really need them. The clay animators and make up artists did a great job! The movie is spooky, funny and very well written. The sequel is all that and much more, but this movie is still a lot fun.",9,0,1,24 July 1999
A Bug's Life," Pixar does it again!
","Pixar delivers more great computer animation! This movie is funny and colorful. There's an all-star cast, just like in the rest of the latest animated movies and they are all doing a great job. Beautiful animation that really comes to life. The real gem in this movie is in the ending titles. Don't miss it!The biggest competition to this movie is 'Antz'. I prefer 'Bug's life' because it's a little lighter, but both films are simply great for kids and adults.",9,0,0,14 August 1999
Toy Story," Pixar kick ass!
","Yap. Those talented people at Pixar shows us that computer animation can be just as alive and creative as drawn animation. People think that the computer 'does all the hard work', but that's not true. 3D animation can be just as difficult, if not more.The voice talent people are great and the animated characters clicked well with the pre-recorded voices. Everything from the toys' facial expressions to body postures is done well, but the real success of the movie comes from a perfect script. As long as the same creative team sticks around, I wouldn't mind ENDLESS sequels to TOY STORY.",10,0,0,9 August 1999
The Mummy Returns," A worthy sequel
","More of the same. If you liked the first Mummy you'd enjoy the second one.
Most of the faces are the same, but the new plot takes them in a different direction. Nothing brilliant, but it serves as a good excuse for a variety of cool scenes in cool locations.  I think I liked the first movie better, but this movie has a few wonderful scenes that make it hard to decide which Mummy movie is better.
  They are both great popcorn movies, I suppose.  The only thing that really bothered me was Freddie Boath who plays the little cute/annoying kid. The problem was that he was more annoying than cute, as a well as an incredibly bad actor. I was not surprised to see that his mother is a producer in his IMDB profile. Oh well...--MB",9,0,0,21 June 2001
Toy Story 2," As great as the first movie was, the sequel is even better
","I went to see this movie at a late show in a cinema packed with adults. I don't remember when was the last time a I heard adults laughing, cheering and stomping their feet with such excitement. For an hour and a half we were all kids again.   The fast paced action adventures goes through a variety of locations and it's all done in the most energetic and exciting way. You could see that the makers of the movie put their heart into it.  And the animation? It just got better.  As long as Pixar can keep up this quality, they can make as many Toy Story sequels as they wish!",10,0,1,16 January 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Shock value galore.
","The movie is very shocking, but when you take away the shock value stuff, it's still good. But the thing is YOU DON'T take away the shock value and it's a very nice movie that will change your life forever (well, maybe not).Very stylish in it's own sick way, this movie will grip you from beginning to end.The movie also has a message, but it almost gets lost in all the mayhem, much like what happened to 'Natural Born Killers'. But who cares?..",8,0,0,6 August 1999
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Shockingly good! Really SHOCKING.
","It's not a horror movie by definition, but it will scare you to death.A bunch of young people are taken to a castle by four masters who torture them in every possible way. It's getting worse and worse to the nearly impossible to watch climax.But the story has a point. It's a clever stylish criticism on fascism and more.It's hard to watch this movie, but it's a very special experience.",10,5,12,5 August 1999
Total Recall," A great ride of violent Sci-Fi!
","A great colorful and original movie about a primitive version of virtual reality: the fake memories...The movie has lots of plot twists and amazing action. though some may find it a little bit too violent, I didn't. I loved it!The psychological aspect of what's real and what's not works here much better than it did in 'Matrix', mostly because it's not the main plot of the movie and it's just there in the background making you wonder...A wonderful movie, one of Schwarzenegger's finest.",10,0,1,11 August 1999
Army of Darkness," Mmm... Funny!
","After watching 'Evil Dead' and 'Evil Dead 2', I expected the third chapter to be something else. But I must say it was a nice surprise.The horror bit is reduced almost to being non-existing. The movie is less gorey and violent as well.BUT-- It's is funnier. The movie is fast paced and very funny. In a way, it's not for the same audience who liked the first two movies, but it's still great.",9,1,1,17 August 1999
Scream 2," It's turning out to be a classic trilogy!
","No, it's not as good as the original. It's differently good.I'm glad the movie has a new setup and a twist, instead of trying to recapture the first movie's setup, because a bad sequel is a sequel that rips off the original.Funny, witty and scary, this movie has some instant classic scenes that are going to be remembered and copied years from now. I can't wait for the third and final part!",10,0,0,24 July 1999
The Lion King," How cute! How funny! How touching!
","One of the best Disney features ever and a true classic. Great songs with scenes that make the screen explode with color. The story is also exciting and touching at some points with plenty of instant-classic characters.If you didn't see it, you MUST. Pure fun with loads of imagination. The sequel is not as good, but.. Heh.. Ok.Hakuna Matata!",10,1,2,5 August 1999
Scream," A classic is born!
","Don't let the premise fool you. It's smart, it's funny, but it's not a parody to the end. It's not a 'Naked Gun' kind of film, this baby is SCARY! The humor is realistic and adds spice to the plot. Horror fans will feel clever, understanding the genre's in-jokes, but most main stream fans will also enjoy this colorful witty horror thriller.",10,0,0,24 July 1999
Halloween," Well... It's not that good twenty years later...
","The movie is very original and it breaks lots of new ground, but still- today it's not scary. The acting is quite boring by a very dull supporting cast you don't really care about, so when they get killed you just don't care.It's a classic, no doubt, but many movies today delivered better stuff... Fans of modern horror may find it too slow and annoying at times, but I liked it. I'm not going to watch it again, though. Not in the near future, anyway. The first sequel is actually better.",8,0,0,10 August 1999
The Iron Giant," A giant classic!
",The Iron Giant is a fantastic animated classic.The story has a big heart with wonderful characters. The friendship between the kid and the robot is handled perfectly.  The clever combination of smooth 2D animation with 3D animation create an attractive world of fantasy. The attention to detail is impressive and is why this movie is so engrossing.The heart of the movie is covered with enough muscles: many genuinely hilarious moments and a climatic action packed finale.A fantastic must-see must-own movie. There's nothing out there like the Iron Giant.--MB,10,1,2,22 June 2001
The Sixth Sense," Don't read about it - just see it.
","The less you hear about it, the better. If you didn't see the movie yet just stop reading about it. Go and see it. One of the most surprising, sensitive and stylish movies of all times. A must see. 'Nuff said.",10,0,0,6 November 1999
Final Destination," Excellent horror thriller
","A really spooky movie. After we had some horror comedies like Scream and slashers like IKWYDLS and Urban Legends, this is a real horror movie. I like the other movies I mentioned, but not as much as Final Destination. Really thrilling and unexpected. The only thing that tainted my pleasure was the ending. Without spoiling it, I'm referring to the very final scene. You'll know what I mean when you'll see it. Turns out that scene was added to the original script and that shows.... After I saw the movie I told myself 'damn, this movie would've been much better without those extra 5 minutes'. Still, a great movie.",10,0,2,13 January 2001
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Original and spooky. Wait a second, make it VERY original.
","The killer who haunts your dreams. How brilliant and simple at the same time: You fall asleep - you're dead. Horror films suppose to make you have nightmares and I sure had some cool elm street nightmares in my life..! Though I was lucky enough to wake up from them. This is the movie that starts it all. When Freddy was mysterious and scary and not a funny lethal Bugs Bunny. A must see! The first trilogy and the 7th movie: 'WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE' are great, 4-6 are NOT.",Null,0,0,5 August 1999
The Matrix," Too much Bible-babble, too little action.
","I don't understand why so many people liked the movie. The worst thing about this movie is the plot. Oooh, the entire world is a VR simulation, how original! Did they come up with it all by themselves? I found the movie to be very boring. Most of the action bits were ok, but between them we got lots of idiotic dialogue that was suppose to be clever. The movie should have been more like T2, with much more action, because the drama and subplots were just sad. And I also must say that the action scenes didn't brake any new ground. We've seen it all before.I know I'm endangering my life here, but I think Godzilla is a better movie.And what with the Bible-babble? 'What is the answer?' - 'What is the question?'... Oooh, I'm impressed! Not.",5,2,5,24 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Indeed a classic!
","It's not a GREAT movie is you just watch it now, and it's even less impressive if you watch the pre-special edition version. The reason is simple: This movie was a milestone in Sci-Fi when it came out 22 years ago, but now there's lots of competition for that style and special effects.Still, it's a classic! You're watching lots of cliches in the making, before they were cliches. The characters are great, the storyline is original, light and fun and Darth Vader is sooo cool! Buy the special edition trilogy. That's the only way to watch it!",7,1,2,4 August 1999
Tarzan," The best animated movie ever!
",As an animation student and as a fan of animation I've seen many movies. Tarzan is probably the best one I've ever seen. Those Disney guys are just getting better and better leaving their 'trace-over-real-actors- competition at WB far behind. The 'acting' of the characters is much better and really touching.The combination of 3D and 2D is great and add a lot to the amazing action scenes.Even if you don't like animation in general GO SEE THIS MOVIE. It's that good and more.,10,1,1,24 July 1999
The Thin Red Line," Long boring movie.
","The adaption doesn't work, sorry. Not for me. I love war movies and poetry, but it just doesn't work for me. I just stared at the screen waiting for the movie to end, but it just stretched on and on making you feel like your sitting in a poetry evening in some pub with lots of fat women reading love songs written ages ago. And what's with the obligatory death scenes? Every second someone else get seriously hurt and he dies in his best friend hands. You don't really recognize the characters as well, they all look the same and act the same, so when they die you don't know what to think.Oh well, at least the movie was indeed over eventually.",Null,4,6,5 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Empire strikes a home run!
","Even better than the first one, this movie is fun! Better special effects and bigger adventures and to top it all: the mother of all soap opera plots!(And I bet EVERYONE knows what I'm talking about) Unlike the first movie, this one is not a stand-alone movie and it connects directly to the third (or should I say sixth?) and final part. You still get the feeling of a complete story and it's f-u-n. Lucas is a genius. Great characters, great worlds of wonder... Wow. Oh, and make sure you watch the special edition! Just buy the special edition trilogy.",8,0,0,4 August 1999
Gladiator," A spectacular epic with a not-so-spectacular script
","The action scenes are spectacular. Men wearing bizarre costumes and armed with inventive weapons try to slash and dice each other. Very entertaining and colorful.
   The plot on the other hand is not that exciting. Nothing new there. The same old characters and the same old conflicts. The script is decent enough to connect the action scenes.",6,0,0,15 January 2001
Jurassic Park," A great thrill ride.
","The groundbreaking computer generated dinosaurs are only one aspect that makes this movie so cool. An engrossing bizarre plot about men playing God and fantastic action-adventure scenes make this movie really exciting and enjoyable.   It is a mixture of many great ingredients: horror, action, comedy, thriller, suspense. And everything is directed with great efficiency by Spielberg.    I read the book before I saw the movie and I was disappointed to see the horror and the violence toned down so much, as well as missing some of the dinosaurs that didn't make it through the adaptation (though the 'missing' dinosaurs were finally introduced in JP3). But I wasn't THAT disappointed.   It's simply enjoyable. It's like one big roller coaster ride. It is a bit formulaic, but also inventive and very well done.",10,2,3,22 July 2001
Evil Dead II," Best sequel ever.
","The beginning is a little confusing. The first movie left our hero alone in the woods and this movie begins with our hero coming to the cabin with his girlfriend... Huh? Very simple: The first scene in the movie is a simple rewrite of the first movie, but instead of five young people it's only a couple. That's all. You'll see that at the end of the first scene it catches up to the ending of the first movie.This movie is the absolute definition of cool! A great combination of horror, humor and pure insanity. Another good thing about this movie is the structure: It's like a supermarket full with all kinds of thrills and scares. Non stop fun!",10,0,1,17 August 1999
