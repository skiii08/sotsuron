Skyfall," Really Bad
","This movie is the worse of 007! Not the common action, neither the emotion, neither nothing... just a creative-less film about a handsome guy that can fight without get a bad appearance... disgusting for the mind! And why in nominated for Oscar...? I think that the system is corrupted... and someone is not doing the real job!Sorry... Bud that is what I think, I think that I'm free to express myselfbecause maybe I can't be OK... or maybe I can be OK... or maybe I can be in between...but just, see the movie and comment me back. :)",1,16,32,8 December 2012
