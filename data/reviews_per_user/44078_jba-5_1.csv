The Ring," Disappointing
","I haven't seen the Japanese original 'Ringu', but I went into this film expecting a nice scare - all I got was great boredom.--- WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS AND WILL NOT MAKE MUCH SENSE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE; AND I THINK YOU SHOULDN'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THAT FILM ---If we don't buy fast enough into the notion taht this tap will kill people who watch it, we're lost. Because the female lead character certainly believes it very soon and without any doubt whatsoever. Too fast for me - I wasn't convinced she wouldn't consider other options.I also couldn't see any sense in the actions that followed: Instead of trying to find out who filmed this thing, she immediately senses that it's all in the (rather laughable) imagery of the video and researches that.The worst thing is, thouh: I never felt scared. Never. Not once.
