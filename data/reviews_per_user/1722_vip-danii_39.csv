The Blair Witch Project," Could Be Worse...
","It's not one of the worst movies I've seen, but it really doesn't live up to the hype. Definitely overrated. Mildly entertaining at times, but also kind of boring on the whole.Goes without saying that it's poorly-made, but that's to be expected from an independent film. Didn't really bother me anyway. 'Cloverfield' was MUCH worse in that respect.One good thing about it, was the fact that it's somewhat refreshing (if you compared it to your typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood slashers).It was more or less suspenseful, I thought. I didn't find it one bit scary, but the suspense WAS present. There wasn't any gore or violence, which I appreciate. No cheap/stereotypical scares, either.Another good thing, is what it wasn't predictable (unlike most Hollywood movies in this genre). You're not sure what's going to happen next and it keeps you watching. The movie kind of drags, but you're curious, which keeps you from falling asleep.The acting was half-decent, but the girl was TERRIBLY annoying. She doesn't shut up for one second, and her obnoxious voice rings in your ears several hours after the movie has ended. Also, she over-acts (kind of like Sandra Bullock -- very annoying).I think calling it a 'masterpiece', as some people have, is a huge overstatement. It's very far from being a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth watching. There are LOTS of high-budget movies that are not half as good as this one.",8,1,3,28 March 2013
Black Swan," Massively Overrated...
","Seeing that there's been so much hype around this movie, and it's got such a high rating on IMDb (currently 8.1), I finally decided to check it out.Well, I honestly fail to understand what all the fuss is about. Nothing remotely impressive about this movie. It's not an awful film, but there's absolutely nothing praiseworthy, either. It's what I call 'background entertainment' (the kind of movie that plays unnoticed in the background while you're doing something else).Some scenes were downright disgusting. Not sure what the point of all the sadism in the movie is; it adds nothing to it. I'm not seeing any of this 'sophistication' people speak of. It reeks of banality and is full of clich√©s. Quite predictable, too.The idea behind it is fascinating, but the delivery ruins it all. The movie is BORING! The only feeling I experienced watching this, was indifference.The characters were not only under-developed, but also rather unlikeable to boot -- all of them. Natalie Portman is generally a half-decent actress, but she wasn't very convincing this time.I'm giving it 1 star only to counter the ridiculously high rating it currently has, which it really doesn't deserve. Otherwise I'd give it 5 or 6 stars (out of 10); don't think it's worth any more.EXTREMELY overrated, but not at all impressive.",1,12,18,2 April 2013
The Hunger Games," No, It Wasn't *THAT* Good!
","So why is this movie so incredibly popular? Is it *that* good? No, actually. Not at all.First of all, this stuff is neither new, nor original. 'The Running Man' has a similar concept, but it's actually more believable. 'Battle Royale' is basically exactly the same movie, but it's also more realistic. This is some twisted interpretation of 'Big Brother'.No, it wasn't *awful*, but, for such an over-hyped movie, with such a huge budget, and such a high rating... I did expect more.Maybe you have to have read the book (which the movie is based on) to understand it properly, but, since I haven't, I didn't quite get the whole idea behind 'Hunger Games'. It is implied that the purpose of the show is to keep the slums (districts) intimidated, and to prevent rebellion. How does that work, exactly? If you think of it logically, having 'Hunger Games' INCREASES the chances of rebellion e.g. families prepare their kids from a young age for the possibility that they might be chosen to enter the game at some point, so a large % of the districts' inhabitants are supposed to be good warriors, with solid survival skills, well prepared to kill and hunt. Not to mention the hatred they all seem to feel towards the organizers of the game. Does this not INCREASE the chances of rebellion instead of decreasing them??And why couldn't these kids just refuse to 'play'? The spectators expect to see people kill each other, so what would happen if the kids just stuck together and didn't give those viewers what they wanted? They'd be forced to stop 'Hunger Games' altogether if, season after season, people refused to 'play'.And... erm, I didn't quite get the 'hunger' reference anyway. There was no evidence of the supposed scarcity of food, and the characters didn't really seem like they were starving. And what exactly is the connection between 'hunger' and children killing each other? The 'future' society looks like the 19th century, and they, most certainly, don't give out the impression of being capable to produce 'genetically engineered killer bees', or medicine that can heal a deep wound in less than 8 hours. It was totally unrealistic. The so-called future looked more like the past. It was extremely primitive, actually. Didn't make any sense.How is it possible to generate images of animals/trees on a computer screen and then instantly transfer them to a physical location as actual living objects (wild animals, burning trees). It would only be possible if the battleground was a simulated environment, which, as far as I'm aware, it wasn't in this case.Character development was really, really sub-par. We know NOTHING about the lead male. No background on him whatsoever. Same goes for the antagonist. Not to mention the rest of the 'players' -- we hardly see any of them, except for Rue (briefly), who, as a matter of fact, serves no purpose whatsoever, and adds nothing to the story. Elisabeth Banks is s***, as usual.I didn't see the point in Liam Hemsworth's character? What purpose did he serve? Why did the lead male side with the bad guys? Is isn't explained. And why did they actually accept him into their group -- knowing that he is romantically interested in the girl they're hunting down? And why DID the 'bad guys' form a group to begin with -- knowing that there can only be one survivor anyway? O.K., so there are 4 of them in this group, and they are hunting down the lead female. What happens after they kill her? They will still have to kill each other, so... what is the point forming a group to begin with? The MOST unrealistic scene in the movie, was the one where the lead female climbs a tree and the bad guys decide to camp beneath her. They could've EASILY shot an arrow at her or set the tree on fire, but they decide to wait for her to come down. O.K., but, in that case, since there are 4 of them, they should've taken turns to watch her, but, instead, they all go to sleep (and wake up) at the same time. How dumb can they be? And that love story between the lead characters was so incredibly lame... I do not want to see anymore of Twilight. That franchise is really getting on my last nerve, and it doesn't help that a lot of movies copy elements from it nowadays. Very disturbing!Anyway...The movie is watchable, but there are a few too many plot holes for my liking, which is really distracting and unsatisfying. I was waiting for some of the answer to be revealed throughout the movie, but... nothing.It's just an extremely poorly pieced together story that, at times, is more frustrating than entertaining.1 star to bring down the overall rating, which is currently much higher than the movie deserves. Otherwise would've rater 5-6.",1,7,10,20 April 2013
Batman Returns," One Of My Favourite Batman Movies!
","Having just seen 'The Dark Knight Rises', I have to say that 'Batman Returns' is superior in several ways: <ul><li>Anne Hathaway's catwoman (or whatever she was supposed to be in TDKR), simply cannot compare to Michelle Pfeiffer's. The former is just one-dimensional, lame and unconvincing.</li></ul><ul><li>'Batman Returns' manages to capture the essence of Gotham City -- the atmosphere is magnificently portrayed (dreary, dark, depressing), which is more than I can say for TDKR, which tries very hard, but fails.</li></ul><ul><li>I did kind of enjoy Bane in TDKR, but his character was severely under-developed and there was not much of a story behind the whole residing-in-the-sewers-for-years stuff. The Penguin in 'Batman Returns' is well explained, the story revolves around the sewers, and a lot of the action takes places there.</li></ul><ul><li>The costumes / the makeup alone are reason enough to see 'Batman Returns' -- amazingly good! In TDKR, there's ABSOLUTELY nothing -- everyone (including Batman) look like they're wearing cheaply-made, lame Halloween costumes from one of those 1$ stores.</li></ul><ul><li>The lead characters are well-developed and colourful -- even the supporting/minor characters. In TDKR, they are one-dimensional, bland, mostly unlikeable, and you just don't care for them much.</li></ul>I liked Christian Bale's Batman a bit better than Keaton's, though. The worst one, without a doubt, was Clooney's.",10,15,32,23 March 2013
The Others," Worth Seeing... If You Can Look Past The Pace.
","I thought it was a half-decent ghost story, but...The pace of the movie is indeed unbelievably slow. It drags... and drags... and drags... I mean, they could (and should!) have told the same story in half the time or less.Other than that, - it's not bad.Nicole Kidman is very talented. The rest of the cast were perfect as well.The 'twist' is pretty original... unless you've seen 'The Sixth Sense' or even 'Ghost Whisperer' (the TV series with Jennifer Love-Hewitt).Anyway... could be much worse. Definitely worth watching.",7,0,2,27 March 2013
Orphan," Better Than Expected!
","I was expecting a typical 'satan's child' movie, but this was not it! The movie starts out quite similar to 'The Omen: Awakening', but as you watch it, you realize that this isn't about anything supernatural...The twist at the end is just... genius! LOL. I would of never guessed!I was really impressed with the acting, too.The movie is griping and the pacing is just right.There was only one cringeworthy scene in the movie (the pond scene towards the end); the rest of the movie is surprisingly realistic.Some people have mentioned that the movie is 'disturbing'. I didn't find it disturbing, and there are hardly any horror scenes. It's a great thriller, though - well worth watching.",10,2,4,10 February 2014
Cloverfield," Are You Kidding Me?
","7.2 (it's current IMDb score)... what?! 7.2? Are you serious? This isn't a movie; it's a bloody mess! An extremely annoying one at that.The shaky camera thing... it's been done before (countless times), but never in such an annoying fashion. The camera is dropped/stepped on several times throughout the movie, but still functions perfectly well and never sustains any internal or external damage. Not to mention that it never runs out of battery life. Lame, but that's not the point. I could look past this kind of plot holes (what plot?) if there was something more to the movie, but there isn't. There's NOTHING entertaining, or suspenseful, or even remotely likable, about this piece of garbage. Nothing. It's an insult to human intelligence, not a movie.Basically, you're just following a bunch of completely unlikeable cardboard cut-outs (I wouldn't call them 'characters', since there was zero character development) running around and acting scared. Of what? It's not clear.I was hoping to see the monster (since it was the one I was rooting for), but... no monster. You never find out what was causing the terror. All you see is people running. I mean it; there's nothing else to this movie except people running.There was no plot. In the beginning you see some lamers at a party (it takes about 20 minutes, and you're already bored out of your mind), and then, for the rest of the movie, you see people running. That's all. Yes, really.I was glad when they all died. I couldn't even tell who was who in the group, because, like I said, there was no character development at all. Just a bunch of random people running around with a camera turned on -- you mostly see their feet anyway.It's laughably pathetic and a huge disappointment. When the movie ends, you just have this huge WTF expression on your face, and you think, 'erm... is that it?' You feel cheated that you sat through an hour and a half (I'm not sure how long it was) of this crap, expecting something to happen, but nothing did.Just dreadful.I am rarely THIS disappointed by a movie.",1,6,7,28 March 2013
Silent Hill," Well, I Did Like The Monsters...
","I'm not a fan of the game (tried to play it once, but didn't like it), so I saw this as a stand-alone movie. And as such, it's totally incoherent.It's full of HUGE and very obvious plot holes and 'WTF' moment. Although... what plot? It's a confusing mess that makes very little sense, not a story.And that whole cult business is so totally ridiculous and unrealistic, I can't even find the right word to describe how stupid it was. A bunch of deluded religious fanatics (incidentally, the same ones that killed that vengeful little girl) living in an abandoned city full of monsters, and believe that nothing else in the world exists -- when the nearest populated - and perfectly normal - town is 15 minutes away? The atmosphere was ridiculous. That constant fog/rain or whatever. Trying too hard. I was not convinced. It's just cheesy and unrealistic. It had a feel of a studio filled with man-generated special effect, not a remote/abandoned location.And why did the dead girl wait for the protagonist to get to the city, and only then she killed off its inhabitants (who, allegedly, tortured her to death)? She had nothing at all to do with this woman, except that her daughter (Sharon) was a look-alike of the dead girl. Maybe it's just me, but nothing in this whole movie makes any sense.Well, the pyramid-head monster looked kind of cool, I'll give them that.Anyway... I don't know what to say about this film, except that it's really not very good (to put it VERY mildly).Like I said, I did kind of like the monsters, but the rest was an utter failure, including the acting. The police woman was GODAWFUL, honestly. What an entirely talentless individual. The rest weren't much better, though.Maybe hardcore fans of the game thought it was good (because, perhaps, they could understand what was going on), but I thought it was a messy, incoherent, unrealistic, depressing (not scary), badly-acted piece of garbage.It is definitely not horror. It's an IMITATION of a psychological thriller. A bad one at that.Wouldn't recommend to anyone.",1,1,3,29 March 2013
The Devil Wears Prada," Watchable, But Not Impressive...
","First of all, this movie is tagged as 'comedy + drama + romance'. The only accurate tag is drama. Honestly, there's no comedy in this film, and also no romance. It's pure drama.Meryl Streep, of course, handles her role to the usual high standards. She is very convincing, and her acting is always brilliant.Anne Hathaway's acting is O.K. this time (she is usually not very good; this is one of her better performances), but the trouble with her character is that 'Andy' is unlikeable from the start, and only gets more and more so throughout the movie. She is snobbish, over-confident, annoyingly smug and arrogant, which makes her unattractive to the viewer.Also, they went way over-the-top with her initial I'm-clueless-about-fashion image. Not at all believable and looks thoroughly fake, as does her attitude. I usually enjoy a movie where makeover is involved, but this was just lame.Emily Blunt is very charismatic and pleasant to look at, but, unfortunately, she turns in a mediocre, annoying performance i.e. she overacts -- constantly.None of the male characters were properly developed. The gay dude was downright annoying (reminded me of that OBNOXIOUS a***hole from 'Sex and the City'). Andrea's boyfriend was unremarkable; he's just kind of there and doesn't fit in with the story. Neither does her second love interest. There zero chemistry between them.And, well, I just didn't get the message. What was the bottom line? Throughout the whole movie Andy busts her butt to impress the bitchy Miranda. So... she has got a makeover, survived the abuse, and finally receives a approval/validation/a reference from Miranda. And...?",6,1,2,30 March 2013
Knowing," Good Concept, Bad Execution
","I quite enjoyed the first half of the movie. The beginning was very promising. I very much enjoyed the 'time capsule' concept.The first half of the movie was intriguing, but then... was the second half written/directed by entirely different people?? I didn't think the acting was very good, either. Absolutely everyone in the movie was sub-par, especially the teacher in the beginning. Well, they were not *horrible*; just not very good.Nicolas Cage's character was quite one-dimensional and unlikeable. The way he neglects his son throughout the movie and treats him like s***. How do you expect people to root for such an uncharismatic, wooden, unremarkable character? The ending was just 'lazy' and thoroughly disappointing. They could've thought of something more original. Honestly. If you're going to have aliens in the movie, at least take some time to introduce them - and their purpose - properly.The second half of the film is just some cheesy religious propaganda. Total drivel. And that scene with the two kids on a supposedly new planet as Adam and Eve... oh, the horror! Words can't convey how cringe-worthy it was.The special effects were a bit lame and unrealistic.(1) Lots of WTF moments, too. For instance, he wasted several hours writing those numbers (from Lucinda's paper) *by hand* on a chalk board?? He could've just made a bloody photocopy! (2) And what about Lucinda? She's clearly disturbed and a major weirdo, yet nobody in school seems to do notice - or care about - her issues. That kind of behavior is impossible to ignore. There wasn't much background on Lucinda at all -- basically, we know nothing about her, even though the whole movie is based around her.(3) What the f*** was that plane crash all about? A plane has crashed (and exploded -- several times!), yet all the people seem to have got away with catching a little fire. Not even them, but their clothes. They seem to be in impeccable condition i.e. not injured in any way. That scene was incomprehensible.And plenty more where that came from.I'm giving it 7 stars just for the premise, which I thought *was* excellent. The execution seriously sucked, though.",7,1,3,18 April 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Still Not Good...
","I remember how excited I was to see T3 when it first came out. Being a huge Arnie and Terminator fan, I had been looking forward to it. But most of all, I remember - very clearly - how huge the disappointment I experienced was.For years, I'd pretend that T2 was the last terminator movie, because I didn't think this embarrassing mess was worthy of being part of the terminator franchise, and I was right -- I saw this movie again the other day, and... it's still s***! Utter s***, to be precise.This movie's nothing like T1 or T2.It's just lame. Especially the female terminator. This was such absurd. That woman, whoever she is, can't even act. Why did they have to bring her in? The story is ridiculous, messy, and totally boring. It was completely unnecessary. If you can't come up with a compelling story, then why make a sequel in the first place?? The characters are cheesy, dull, and unlikeable. You don't want to see more than 10 minutes of these idiots, let alone root for any of them.Oh, and... I thought this movie was made just to show off the special effects and impressive action sequences, which the movie was supposed to have (since there was no story or anything), but even that was s***! The special effect in T1 are better, for Pete's sake! And all the 'action' is just lame. Honestly, there's no suspense at all, and when the terminators fight -- it's just ridiculous (like the rest of the meaningless 'action' in this movie').T1 was good. T2 was perfect. T3... I'll just keep pretending it never existed.",1,0,2,23 April 2013
The Orphanage," A Decent Ghost Story, But It's *NOT* Horror!
","'The Others' was not a horror movie, and neither is this.There were hardly any scary moments. The only two that were MILDLY reminiscent of 'disturbing' were (1) the scene when the boy shuts the bathroom door and breaks the woman's fingers, (2) when the old lady gets killed by a truck.That's about it.I'm not sure why they keep insisting on classifying thrillers as horror. This ISN'T horror. It's just not.I enjoy a movie like this, though. I'm not a huge fan of violence/gore, so I was glad that there was almost none of it in this film. It wasn't exactly suspenseful, but it *was* very atmospheric and, at times, creepy. The acting was top-notch, too.A first-rate ghost story; definitely worth watching. You will not be disappointed if you're a fan of ghost movies/psychological thrillers, and if you liked 'The Others'.But you *will* be disappointed if you expect gore/violence or scary/disturbing moments (like in Japanese horror movies) -- there's none of that here.",3,1,4,6 April 2013
Rocky IV," My Favourite Rocky Movie!
","This movie came out before I was born, but I have been a great fan of Rocky's ever since I saw the first one, and this one is my favourite.Just watched it again tonight, and it's still as good as I remember! I did not particularly like the ending, though. It was a bit lame for my liking. And I was not very impressed with the insultingly inaccurate portrayal of The Soviet Union, but I can overlook that.This movie has a lot going for it. Such colourful characters, great dialogue, interesting plot, top quality acting... never a dull moment.It's a shame they don't make such good movies nowadays... I never get tired of watching this -- it's a classic.",10,3,4,18 March 2013
Dark City," Incoherent, Cheesy Borefest!
","I didn't really want to watch this movie as I could tell from the DVD cover that it was going to be crap, but the high rating got me curious.Very disappointed indeed.I really fail to understand what all the praise is about. Did all these people, who give it more than 5/10, even watch the same movie I did? If so, there must be something I'm missing, because, to me, this was utter crap.The so-called aliens were, quite possibly, the cheesiest I've EVER seen. What kind of amateurs created such unconvincing mess? It was just cringe-worthy.The movie is painfully slow and boring. I was hoping that it would get better eventually... never did. The 'twist' was predictable and unoriginal.Like I said, I do not understand all those people, who give this borefest a high rating. This movie is not even in the same zip code as 'mildly entertaining'.In fact, it's literally unwatchable.",1,11,24,6 April 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Unimpressed!
","What exactly was this? A remake? Or a prequel? Not clear.First of all, who the hell remakes a 5 year old movie!? It's acceptable to remake movies from the 70s, 80s, and even the 90s! But the original 'Spiderman' franchise is only FIVE bloody years old! Come on! If it ain't broke, why fix it? If it was meant as a prequel, then why are we seeing the same stuff we saw in the original, and why are all the characters so different? I honestly have no idea what possessed these people to produce such crap. The original 'Spiderman' was (and still is) 100 times better, and it's not REMOTELY old or outdated.By the way... this is NOT an action movie; it's a chick-flick! Literally.And what's with this annoying tendency to cast 30-year-olds to play teenagers? It's lame. Speaking of the actors, they couldn't have picked a worst set of amateurs. I don't even remember their names, and I hope they're going to retire from the movie industry sometime soon, because they have no business being in it.The direction was seriously bad. Like I said before, it's NOT an action movie, but the VERY LITTLE action there is, is happening in total darkness, so you don't actually see it! Stupid and annoying! This is NOT the real 'Spiderman'; it's a cheap imitation. Some pathetic 30-year-old wimp, pretending to be a teenager, is running around and getting beat up by regular folk? What an insult to 'Spiderman' fans! Oh, and why release this utter nonsense in 3D if 90% of the movie is in 2D? This weak, useless, uninspired chick-flick was made for one reason only: to capitalize on the name of the 'Spiderman' franchise and rip people (fans) off!Shame on you!",1,6,21,13 April 2013
Dirty Dancing," I *Still* Don't Get It...
","I saw this movie for the first time when I was still a pre-teen, because one of the girls I knew from school (an older teenager) was obsessed with it. I didn't get it back then. I saw this movie again in my late teens, and didn't get it then, either. Watched it again the other day, and I STILL don't get it! I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's unremarkable, boring, predictable, monotonous, and thoroughly mediocre. As if that wasn't enough, it also manages to be offensive to boot. The plot was disgustingly predictable and uninspiring; the dialogue - horrendous. There was ZERO chemistry between the lead actors. In fact, it was quite apparent that they can't stand each other. Speaking of characters, - they were all HIGHLY unlikeable. Johnny = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional a***hole.Baby = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional slag. And it's actually quite disgusting that Patrick Swayze, who seems to be in his mid-30s, is sleeping with a girl 15-20 years his junior. Granted, she was a slapper, but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers? Don't get me wrong, I did like 'Lolita' (where the same was happening, but it's expected, and actually quite tastefully done), but this... was just creepy and disturbing. It's just my opinion, but I think one must be slightly retarded to refer to this utter disgrace as a 'masterpiece'.",2,3,12,31 March 2013
District 9," A Bit Overrated, I'm Afraid...
","I was looking for an alien movie to watch, and picked this one because of the high rating (it's currently 8.0).I was left wondering what the fuss was about...This movie is obviously far more superior than the likes of 'Skyline' and other run-of-the-mill disposable Hollywood trash, but it's really not THAT good (people are calling it 'a masterpiece', for Pete's sake!).The idea behind it is nothing short of brilliant, but the execution is well below par, in my opinion.Personally, I did not enjoy the amount of violence. And why were the aliens so... passive? I felt the story was badly developed. I mean, why were those background comments needed if they didn't really explain anything properly? I did not understand what the aliens were about, and how they interacted with humans all these years. We know nothing about that Nigerian (?) gang that sells cat food / trades weapons with the aliens.In the plus column, though: the aliens were cool by design. Quite realistic. And yes, - it's a half-decent story; something FRESH and ORIGINAL at last.Bottom line: definitely worth watching. Once.",6,2,4,25 March 2013
28 Days Later...," Could Be Much Better... Potentially.
","My main problem with this movie was the extremely unlikeable lead characters. Namely, the female. The guy was not much better, but the woman was just TOO obnoxious. As soon as she is introduced, you can't wait for her to be killed off (except, you know that it's not likely to happen).Secondly, I hated the whole crazy British Army soldiers situation. Wanting to gang rape an underage girl (or ANY girl, for that matter)... this was really uncalled for, and, for me, spoiled the whole movie. So the main priority for these men is to reproduce, while the planet is being ravaged by zombies??? Right...They could've come up with something more logical (and less disturbing), which would've made the movie SO much better.The acting wasn't great in general. Except for the father, most characters were too one-dimensional, unconvincing, and quite unlikeable. You don't empathize with any of them, and have no desire to root for these people. The awful acting only makes things worse.Well, I have to say the setup was quite good, though. And the zombies were convincing enough (unlike in 'I am Legend'). The movie isn't monotonous or predictable, which is good.But anyway, I'd probably only watch this movie again if there was NOTHING else available.",6,1,3,17 March 2013
Gone Girl," Lame and unrealistic.
","Currently rated 8.0 on IMDb... are you kidding me? This film is not THE worst I've seen, but, in all honestly, 8.0 is far, far too high a rating for what I thought was one of the lamest movies I've seen in recent years.If you're going to make a movie that doesn't have a protagonist... if you just want to tell a story... at least make sure it's a good story and believable to some degree. The events in this movie are so unrealistic and played-up - things like that would NEVER happen in real life.There are lots and lots of really obvious plot-holes - not a good thing in a move that's already near-unwatchable.Some events in the movie are shockingly unrealistic. For example, all she does for disguise is dye her hair a slightly darker colour. Then she (with her new identity) sits with her new-found friends watching (and discussing) her own story on TV, and nobody seems to notice that the woman on TV is the same one sitting next to them, with slightly darker hair. Oh, puh-lease. If this isn't an insult to human intelligence, then I don't know what is.Basically, there are plenty of 'what-the-fcuk' moments; it makes you wonder whether the people involved in the project were intending this movie for the mentally handicapped. Indeed, one HAS to be a bit 'slow' in order to enjoy this poorly-written plot. If you're into analyzing movies, you will find this one downright insulting, I'm sure.This movie can be criticized for hours - there's too much that's wrong with it, but I think I've wasted enough time watching, and then reviewing, this train-wreck of a movie, so I'll be moving on now.",1,6,11,30 July 2015
2012," Nowehere Near As Good As Expected...
","My main problem with this movie was the fact that it was just so unbelievably unrealistic, full of clich√©s and seedy propaganda.I found the scenes when the disaster strikes to be an insult to human intelligence. I mean, do you expect anyone to believe that, while the earth is destabilizing ALL AROUND AT THE SAME TIME, and we see hundreds of people and cars go to waste, the protagonist and his family have this magical ability to dodge every bullet, and they're the only ones in the whole city unaffected by the disaster and manage to get away safely while building are collapsing and the ground in moving? Right! How lame and unrealistic is that? It's so predictable and cheesy... there's no suspense whatsoever, and you are not simply bored, but also disgusted and offended.I mean, the protagonist is a writer/limo driver, but he is portrayed as someone with almost superhuman powers. The ground is destabilizing under his feet, but he manages to save not only himself, but his whole family and the car + conveniently get to a plane and successfully board it while everyone else in the city dies.And everything else about this movie is equally bad. Never ending clich√©s, bad dialogue, and disgustingly predictable action scenes. Of course, the US president has to be black. Of course, there is a dysfunctional/estranged family that will be brought together by the disaster. Of course, religious propaganda is involved. Of course, there are wealthy Russians and Arabs. Of course, there's a dumb blonde. Of course, the bad guy turns good in the end. Of course, you know right away who's going to live and who's going to die -- you even know when and in what order (yes, it's THAT predictable).Honestly, it's just really boring a lot of the time. Like I said: zero suspense and zero originality.Unconvincing, boring, lame = the three words that summarize it perfectly.I thought that the President, as well as his adviser (the scientist) and his daughter were HORRIBLY miscast. None of these actors should've been in the movie. They're VERY unconvincing in their roles. Most actors in this movie are just really, really, really bad.I hated the soundtrack, too.I admire John Cusack; he's a splendid actor, but he couldn't save this disastrous mess. I think it's below his dignity to be associated with such a stupid excuse for a movie, so I have no idea why he agreed to star in it.To add insult to injury, they brought in a Paris Hilton look-a-like (who plays a rich Russian dude's lover), and she gets a lot of screen time -- without actually serving any purpose (just like actual Paris Hilton). The movie seems to put a large emphasis on how important it is to save Paris Hilton and her purse rat. I'm not sure I understand what this is about.I never really had high expectation for this film, but, turns out, it's worse than I thought. A huge disappointment.",4,0,1,25 March 2013
The Mist," A Really Good Movie, But Would've Been Better If...
","Yes, a great movie, as expected. I was quite impressed with the actors; they really did a fine job -- all of them.I usually try to avoid movies, where one of the lead actors has a kid. If there's a kid in a movie, you can expect this kid to (1) take up more movie time than necessary, (2) be disgustingly obnoxious most of the time, (3) be accompanied by a hysterical, over-protective, and equally annoying and obnoxious parent.I was pleasantly surprised that none of the above was present in this movie.It's a genuinely good piece of work, but here's what spoilt it for me:(1) The ending was a real stinker. I mean, do they think people want an ending like that? It was very, very disappointing, depressing and completely unnecessary. Extremely inconsiderate of them to let us (the viewers) down so bad.(2) They should have developed the story more. We never really get to learn *anything* about this mist or the nature of experiments that it was a consequence of. Surely, it would've been more interesting if the soldiers, trapped in the supermarket, knew something more about the whole thing -- other than 'military experiments must've opened a door to another dimension'.(3) The whole religious lady situation was a tad too unrealistic. It was good in the beginning, but when she demanded they 'sacrifice' the soldier, and then - the kid... it started getting ridiculous. I can understand if ONE already demented religious fanatic goes insane and stops making any sense, but the whole group serving this nut and fulfilling her whims?? Sure, they're a bunch of dumb hillbillies, but NO ONE is THAT retarded.(4) We never really get to see the monsters. We see a tentacle at one point, and some over-sized mosquitoes, but the 'main' monsters that are, supposedly, inside the mist, never make an appearance.(5) The dude - Brent Norton... he was supposed to be arrogant, not dumb as a rock. It was so annoying and unrealistic when he flat out refused to accept common sense. Even though people are offering him to SEE proof for himself, he refuses to listen to anyone. We already have a religious nut that behaves this same exact way, so there was no need to turn THIS guy into a village-idiot-in-denial as well.Other than that, the movie was very good. I'd definitely watch it again (but, naturally, skip the depressing ending).",9,1,5,20 March 2013
I Am Legend," Not The Worst Zombie Movie, But...
","This movie is definitely worth watching if you're a fan of zombie movies, but... there are two HUGE turn-offs.(1) The most obvious flaw, are the so-called monsters. They are so poorly-done and unrealistic, it's actually cringe-worthy. The supposedly scary infected humans (half-vampires or whatever they're supposed to be), look ridiculous and cartoonish. The scenes in which these computer-generated characters are present, are embarrassing to watch. I know nothing about movie-making, but even I cringed when these creatures (or rather cartoon characters) stepped into the picture.(2) I was offended by the religious propaganda that is, quite obviously, being promoted in this movie.--- Plus, a few more: - Will Smith is a decent actor, but he is, essentially, playing Will Smith in every movie. It doesn't help matters that there was hardly any character development in 'I Am Legend'. You don't see Will Smith's character, you see Will Smith.<ul><li>That kid (Ethan), was really quite annoying. I think the movie would've been better without him. The first annoying kid (Will Smith's daughter) would've been enough. More than enough.</li></ul><ul><li>There are quite a few very obvious plot holes. For example, how did Anna manage to drag a guy, who is twice her weight, out of an upside down car and shove him into hers, while there was a bunch of hungry monsters right there, and her own 10 year old kid to protect at the same time? - The scene where Sam (the dog) is bitten by a monster (cartoon) dog, is utterly ridiculous. Especially the situation with the ray of light.</li></ul>--- There are more things I found obnoxious and out of place, but the point is: this movie is O.K., but really could've been SO much better with a bit more effort/consideration.",8,1,2,17 March 2013
8 Mile," Not Perfect, But Better Than Other Musicians' Movies (Vanity Projects) I've Seen...
","I enjoy some of Eminem's music, and I think he is actually a fairly decent actor (well, compared to 50 Cent at least).'8 Mile' is watchable, but could've been better, I think. The film feels rushed and under-developed. I know it's essentially a vanity project (autobiography, perhaps), but they should've added more substance to it. Such an interesting/explorable personality as Eminem deserves better than this.There are quite a few cringe-worthy moments. The nicknames were ridiculous. 'Bunny Rabbit'? Are you kidding me? Can anyone take a guy seriously with a nickname THAT dumb? And I think I know why they named that other guy 'Cheddar Bob'. Because this character is CHEESY beyond all human comprehension. He is just kind of out of place there.The characters were mostly underdeveloped and quite one-dimensional. There is very little introduction to the leads, let alone the supporting cast. The black guys (the antagonists) all look the same and you can't really tell who's who. Also, you don't understand 'Future's' involvement with Jimmy and his relationship with the 'bad' guys. It should have been explained to at least some extent.Jimmy's ex-girlfriend appears in the movie for no apparent reason -- her screen time is precisely 5 seconds. We never get to find out anything about her, except that she's the crappy actress that starred alongside Britney Spears in the lame disaster that her movie 'Crossroads' was. Looks like this woman specializes in playing minor roles in musicians' vanity projects.Kim Basinger IS a good actress, but, in my opinion, she was miscast. Not only is she unconvincing as trailer trash, but she really doesn't fit in with the rest of the cast. She is far too talented to star alongside such amateurs.Brittany Murphy, on the other hand, does a fairly good job. While she is not super-talented, she is surprisingly good at playing a trailer trash junkie hooker. But are we supposed to feel any sympathy for Jimmy when his new 'girlfriend' (Brittany Murphy) makes fun of / cheats on him? For Pete's sake, she's the local prostitute, who has slept with most, if not all, of the guys Jimmy is feuding with, so what the f*** was he thinking asking out the neighborhood hooker? But, please, tell me who did her hair for this movie. That person needs to be named and shamed.The little girl is terrible. Her parents must be friends with Eminem or someone involved with the movie; I see no other reason why she'd get the part. There are many really talented child actors, who could have benefited from this role, but THIS is the one they picked...? Why?Anyway... I did like the movie back when it first came out, and, having watched it again the other day, still enjoyed it. I won't say it's one of THE BEST movies ever made (it's not), but it's entertaining enough for my taste.",8,0,0,30 March 2013
Paranormal Activity," True story: I have tried to see this movie 4 times!
","I started watching it in the morning one day... and fell asleep 15 minutes into the movie. Then I put it on in the afternoon and the same thing happened. Then - in the evening; didn't make it, either.I did eventually manage to sit through the whole thing (4th attempt), and now I'm wondering why I bothered. It was painfully boring and cheesy.I *really* fail to understand what all the fuss is about. I only saw this movie because there was so much hype around it, and now I'm totally gobsmacked -- I honestly don't understand what it is that people like about it.Someone had already told me that it was 'nothing special', so I didn't expect anything extraordinarily brilliant. But... it was a lot worse than 'nothing special'. It was UTTER CRAP! I can't get over the fact that this piece of s*** has become such a popculture phenomenon. I mean... 3 sequels!? Zero entertainment, zero suspense, and absolutely NOTHING to hold your interest/attention. There is nothing new or original or innovative, or even noteworthy, about this lousy excuse for a movie.I wouldn't watch this nonsense again if they paid me. I would, however, recommend it highly as a cure for insomnia. Worked wonderfully well for me.One word: boring. EXTREMELY boring.",1,3,4,26 March 2013
The Dark Knight," Probably The Best Batman Movie So Far, But...
","This is a very good movie in general, but here are a few things that did bother me about it: (1) The worst part of the movie was Batman's voice. It's just embarrassing, honestly.(2) Maggie is just not convincing as a lawyer. She's too immature and too flirty to be taken seriously. She isn't a very good actress, but probably a slightly better choice than Katie Holmes for this particular role, though still far from perfect.(3) There are a number of things that are just too unrealistic. The movie would've been better if you could actually relate to at least one of the characters, but that's not the case. For example...<ul><li>Batman seems to have almost superhuman powers, and everything he does is perfectly executed. He overcomes every obstacle effortlessly and never struggles with anything. Even the lame Spiderman (who is also based on a comic book character) is more convincing, because at least you can relate to him.</li></ul><ul><li>The Joker seems to run the city, and have a number of accomplices (it is implied that they're mentally ill criminals from the local asylum or something), but how did he accomplish all of that? He seems to plan everything perfectly, and his handymen are loyal and never fail him (while it is obvious that they're disposable assets that he kills off when he no longer needs them). The whole city seems to be working for/with the Joker, but the police can't locate any associates? </li></ul><ul><li>Why on earth would you evacuate the whole hospital, but somehow forget the city's district attorney, who is known to be targeted by the Joker?</li></ul><ul><li>Gotham is a small city, and it is fairly obvious that the only person, who could possibly afford the Batman gadgets, is Bruce Wayne, yet no one seems to suspect him.</li></ul><ul><li>How on earth did that guy in the courtroom manage to sneak in a gun!?</li></ul><ul><li>I could go on...</li></ul>(4) I saw this at the movies, and also on DVD, and the sound effects on both were VERY disturbing. You can barely hear the dialogue, but when the sound effects come on, it might give one a heart attack -- not because there's anything scary, but because they come on at the wrong time, are too sharp, and *extremely* loud (as well as the background music). It's very annoying and off-putting.(5) I thought the most ridiculous character was Gambol - the jumpy Afro-American guy. He's a typical dumb drug dealer or something (at best), so how on earth did he get to share space with those big mafia bosses? Anyway, despite the above, I thought this was better than 'Batman Begins'. Would definitely watch again. I do think the movie is slightly overrated, though. But The Joker really was *that* good. I did want to see more of the Scarecrow, too, but...",9,0,4,17 March 2013
Elysium," Forgettable.
","Elysium, as pointed out by the majority of previous reviewers, has pretty good CGI, but that's about the only thing going for it. A really stupid remake of Robin Hood, is what this movie really is.District-9 was innovative, and it didn't feel like a typical high-budget Hollywood blockbuster, which, I guess, was the reason it was so well-received. I still hated it, though.Elysium is clearly intended to feel like a high-budget Hollywood blockbuster, and it does. But all the CGI cannot distract one from the paper-thin plot, one-dimensional characters, and totally unrealistic story-line... and, of course, the abundance of plot holes.You'd think that, with such a star-studded cast, the movie couldn't go wrong. Well, the acting was really below average. Jodie Foster was awful. But not as bad as Alice Braga (I can't believe she still gets roles -- with *this* little talent?) Anyway, if I had to describe the movie in one word, that word would be 'forgettable'.I did not find it very impressive. Do I have to explain why? That would mean spending far more time than intended on this review, which is not something I'm interested in doing.The bottom line: I didn't like it. Will *you*? I have no idea. But one thing is clear: this movie does not have the potential to leave a lasting effect on people. It's just... well, like I said, *forgettable*.",4,1,3,5 September 2015
Saw," Urgh... Sick and Disgusting Movie!
","I have no idea why so many people like this movie. I thought it was disgusting. Seriously, you've got to be pretty sick and f***ed up in the head in order to actually enjoy something like this.'Seven' (Se7en) is similar in many ways, but it was way better.The acting was really atrocious. I haven't seen such bad acting in a long time. Not only the two leading actors were bad, but also the supporting cast.The movie tries very hard to be clever and serious, but it has noting to offer but gore and sadism. It relies solely on shock value. Not logical, not entertaining, not realistic. It would've possibly made a good thriller as the premise is intriguing enough, but the execution failed miserably.There were quite a few plot holes and inconsistencies. The serial killer's motives were unconvincing and ridiculous. And the 'twist'... don't even get me started on that. It was really an insult to human intelligence.The only thing that I liked about this movie, was the fact that it was very atmospheric and the special effects were good.It's quite a disturbing movie (in a bad way); definitely not for the faint hearted. I still don't understand how anyone... anyone at all... is able to enjoy / derive satisfaction from watching something of this kind.",1,2,4,27 May 2014
The Happening," Not Very Entertaining...
","It would've been O.K. as a made-for-TV movie, but nothing more than that. It's quite cheaply-made and generally unimpressive. The idea behind it is somewhat intriguing, but the execution is seriously poor. Full of plot holes, bad dialogue, and horrendous acting.Mark Wahlberg looks very uncomfortable throughout this movie, which renders him unconvincing. Quite clearly, he's not the guy for this role. Zoey Deschanel has never been a good actress, but her ridiculousness has reached a new low in this film. Those scenes where she deals with her phone stalker... I mean, can anyone in the entire film industry be THAT bad (at acting)? It was painful to watch. The supporting characters were, in fact, as bad as the leads.I was very disappointed by the ending. This is the kind of movie, where you can get away with killing off all the characters. It would've been so much better, and I would've rated the movie higher. But, instead, they chose the 'predictable to the point of disgust' route -- from the minute you start watching, you have no doubt whatsoever as to who exactly is going to die and how the whole thing is going to end.The script was a disaster. It's so badly-written and obviously fake, every second of the movie you are reminded that you're watching a movie, which makes it very hard to enjoy. Everything they say, sounds forced -- you don't hear this kind of dialogue in real-life. It's very lame and unconvincing.It isn't quite on the list of THE worst movies I've seen, but it's nevertheless not very good. I guess it's worth seeing -- once, but only as long as you don't have to pay for it.",5,2,4,30 March 2013
30 Days of Night," One Of The Best Vampire Movies!
","I thought the movie was very good. The storyline is compelling, the atmosphere - realistic, and, most importantly, the movie does a fairly good job staying away from cheese and clich√©s, which are present in most vampire movies.The things that, in my opinion, were not perfect: <ul><li>They could've developed the characters a bit more (including the vampires!).</li></ul><ul><li>The Stranger was a very interesting character, but we never get to learn much about it, or see any of the activity he engages in prior to the vampires' arrival (it is employed that it's him who prepared the city for the vampires by destroying cell phones, killing dogs, etc.). they could've found a more interesting use for him throughout the movie.</li></ul><ul><li>There was no need for THAT much gore.</li></ul><ul><li>The vampires were TOO aggressive for my liking. I guess they were supposed to be that way, but I found it slightly over-the-top.</li></ul><ul><li>The lead actors don't look realistic for their roles. Josh looks like he's just stepped down from a Calvin Klein underwear ad poster, but, unlike his female counterpart, he CAN act. The girl also looks like a catwalk model, and she is EXTREMELY unconvincing as a law enforcement officer. Just wrong for this particular role.</li></ul>Basically, the movie could've have been better had they placed more emphasis on the characters and the story, rather than just filling every frame with gore, running vampires and screaming humans. And it would've DEFINITELY be much better if they replaced the lead actors with some realistic-looking people -- these were too 'glamorous' to pull off such roles. That's about it. All in all, the movie is actually very good. Would definitely watch again, and recommend to those interested in this genre.",8,2,3,19 March 2013
Burlesque," Pleasantly Surprised...
","I saw this movie expecting the worst, but was pleasantly surprised. It has to be one of the... least annoying... musicals in recent years.Usually, when a pop-star is involved in a movie, you automatically assume that it's going to be a flop, and it usually is, but 'Burlesque' was an exception.Cher is actually very good. Christina Aguilera is not a great actress, but she was not half as bad as, for example, fellow pop stars Britney Spears in 'Crossroads', and Jessica Simpson in... pretty much anything she's associated with.While the plot is very clich√©d and predictable, it's still moderately entertaining. It's a very eye-catching and polished movie, with lots of gorgeous costumes and some great singing from Cher and Christina.I thought the antagonists should've been developed a bit better, which would have improved the movie significantly, but... oh, well. Actually, the same goes for Christina Aguilera's character. They didn't bother making her likable or at least less... one-dimensional; it's only her natural charisma that carries her through.Also, the supposedly-romantic scenes could've been better -- they were predictable, unexciting, and forced.Yes, this movie imitates elements of 'Chicago', 'Show Girls', 'Cabaret', 'Coyote Ugly', and probably some other movies, but it really didn't bother me much.Anyway, I think this movie is worth seeing -- even if you're not a fan of either Cher or Christina Aguilera. Unlike most movies starring pop singers, this one is actually watchable, so...",8,0,0,31 March 2013
Hancock," Why Did They Have To Ruin Such a Good Idea?
","A very original idea, but... the execution somewhat ruined it.The first part of the movie is actually very good, but it declines steadily as soon as 'the twist' is introduced. Towards the end, it gets so boring, unconvincing and lame -- it becomes genuinely intolerable and impossible to sit through.I did not like the 'twist'; it was cheesy at best. Really unnecessary; ruined the whole movie. Charlize Theron is SO not convincing as a superwoman. Laughably pathetic. She's normally a half-decent actress, but this time her performance is so awfully bad, it's embarrassing.It's kind of 'cute' (and actually convincing) that Hancock hates the terms 'a**hole', but when superwoman starts imitating this, you just cover your face and think: 'Oh, puh-lease!' It's just too annoying.The movie was also lacking a good antagonist. Was that bank robber supposed to make up for that? If so, it really didn't work.The character of that supposed PR *guru* (Ray) is not at all believable. Throughout the whole movie, he is portrayed more like an amateur -- busting his butt to make it in PR, but getting rejected over and over again... until Hancock comes along.Will Smith, as usual, plays the same character (himself). He does so in EVERY movie, so the public is somewhat used to it, I suppose. They should quit giving him character names, and just let him be Will Smith as Will Smith -- that'll be more convincing and less irritating. It is his charisma that carries him through, not his acting abilities anyway.If you compare will Smith to, say, Cate Blanchett, you will realize that Will Smith is NOT an actual actor. He is comfortable in front of the camera, and he has some charisma, but he can't portray anyone else but Will Smith.I would watch the movie again; it's kind of entertaining -- until Mary reveals her superhuman powers. That's when it becomes lame and unwatchable.It's a shame, though... they could've made the movie a whole lot better by not shoving all that LAME superwoman crap in it.",9,2,3,23 March 2013
Prometheus," A Major Disappointment...
","'Alien' was a classic. This is yet another hypey Hollywood blockbuster that was forgotten immediately after viewing. I saw it the week it came out, in 3D. Re-watched it again just now, and it's still crap.One word to describe the movie: 'disappointing'. Why? Because it felt rushed, severely under-developed, inconsistent, poorly put together, unrealistic, amateurish, and, at times, downright laughable.Lots of WTF moments. Scientists basing most of their rationalization and decisions on 'this is what I choose to believe?' It's a trillion dollar mission, yet no-one seems to know why they are there and what's expected of them? Taking your masks off on an unfamiliar planet, where air could be contaminated? What do you do when you make the most important discovery in the history of mankind -- get drunk, of course!? A guy who freaks out when he sees a dead alien body then decides to pet, and play with, an unfriendly-looking alien cobra? Running around with your abdomen sliced open and held together by a few metal staples? Giving birth to a squid less than 24 hours after intercourse with an infected individual -- and you don't tell anyone, and nobody notices, and having wanted it out of you so badly, you forget to kill it once it's out? Seeing that you're about to get squashed by an incoming alien space craft, instead of moving sideways, you continue to run *away* from it? Are you kidding me? Ridiculous. This half-arsed movie is unwatchable! It's an insult to human intelligence.And as soon as the team meet 'our creators' (for some reason, there's only one -- and he is a moody bald bodybuilder that has been abusing steroids?), the creators immediately rush to their ship to get to our planet and destroy it? Jeez, they had that option for, like, centuries; why now? Why are they hostile towards us in the first place? Not clear.I think most of the characters were totally unnecessary. Some of them served no purpose whatsoever. It's like they had a lot of spare money, and decided to spend it on employing more actors for no apparent reason. The people behind this movie should have used the spare money to pay a competent screen-writer to review the story-line and dialogue, both of which were a complete joke in my opinion.P***-poor acting by Charlize Theron. Jeez, she cannot pull off a role like this, sorry. The lead female was half-decent; the rest were not very good. Zero character development. The characters were unlikeable and not at all interesting. Plus, none of them could pass for an actual scientist; not in a million years. And speaking of characters: where did they all go? Some of them were killed, but what happened to the others -- it was never explained; they just vanished.You know, watching this reminded me of watching daytime soap, honestly. Boring, over-dramatized, completely unrealistic. No tension, no suspense... just a bunch of poorly-chosen random people getting paid to act out a ridiculous script.Some reviewers have described this movie as 'thought provoking'... Well, I assure you I'm not being sarcastic when I say that I've seen some episodes of Barney the Purple Dinosaur that were more though-provoking than this. The only thought it provokes, is this: why was this movie necessary, and who is the target audience (the mentally handicapped or pre-schoolers)? The only good thing I can say about this movie: good scenery (especially in 3D). But people go to see movies primarily for the story, so the visuals alone are not quite enough, sadly.",1,4,5,13 September 2015
1408," One Of The Best Psychological Thrillers Out There!
","I wouldn't class this movie as 'horror'; it's a psychological thriller / ghost story -- and as such, it's unsurpassed by my standards.A very original story. Mike Enslin's character is well-developed, but I would've liked to know more about the GM of the hotel, as well as the room itself (instead of seeing so much of that dead little girl; I wasn't interested in her at all, but I see why she was necessary).Instead of just shutting the room down, they should've conducted scientific research in it. In this day and age, people don't ignore things like that -- this was kind of unrealistic, but the rest of the movie was pretty believable and effective.John Cusack is a very talented actor, and '1408' has to be his best movie.I have seen it a number of times and never get tired of it.Highly recommended.",10,1,1,26 March 2013
The Sixth Sense," Deserves All The Praise!
","I enjoy ghost movies, and this one has to be one of the best.I knew that Bruce Willis's character was going to turn out to be dead -- from the moment the kid announces that he can see ghosts. I thought that his character a bit one-dimensional, though. I'm not sure whether the acting or character development is to blame.The movie is pretty good on the whole, but the amount of inexcusable gaping plot holes is ridiculous... such as: <ul><li>How did he go one whole year without speaking to anyone or being acknowledged by anyone (except the little boy), and not figure out that something is wrong? </li></ul><ul><li>He lives with his wife, and... for a whole year, they manage to co-exist in the same household -- without interacting? Not believable.</li></ul><ul><li>So Bruce Willis is a ghost, so why can't he see other ghosts? </li></ul><ul><li>The boy knows that his 'therapist' is a ghost, but he doesn't tell him, and he's not afraid of him the way he is of all the other ghosts.</li></ul><ul><li>How did he get assigned to treat that kid? Who'd hire a ghost? How did he collect his salary? How did he interact with the kid's Mom, and whom did he pass his assessments to? </li></ul><ul><li>How did a ghost manage to use audio tapes and a PC? We see that he writes and prints out reports. How is that possible for a ghost to do? </li></ul>Basically, there are MANY a plot hole here...But! It doesn't alter the fact that the movie is entertaining and enjoyable. The kid's acting was impeccable. I have never seen such outstanding performance by a child actor (or even a professional adult actor). I was very impressed.I think the movie deserves the high rating. Definitely far superior to the lousy 'Paranormal Activity' franchise. The latter is just a lame joke compared to this one.",8,1,1,5 April 2013
Easy A," Not Bad...
","I didn't really expect much, but the movie is actually quite enjoyable. I was pleasantly surprised.At least the story is somewhat original.But I couldn't help thinking that Emma Stone was not the one to play the lead. It would've been perfect for AMANDA BYNES! Emma Stone did a great job, though. Her acting was surprisingly good. But she was wrong for the role. She is pretty, charming, likable. So how on earth would someone like her be an outcast? Amanda Bynes, on the other hand, could have pulled it off easily. She is not as one-dimensional as Emma Stone; she can do both - geeky and preppy. I really think the movie would've been much better if Olive was portrayed by Amanda Bynes.But anyway... a decent chick-flick.",7,2,3,10 November 2014
A Walk to Remember," It's Been Done Before... Hundreads of Times.
","Just your stereotypical lame teen flick -- with major religious undertones, which, by the way, was quite annoying at times. It's all been done before, and much better than this.The 'bullies' were so one-dimensional and unconvincing. They failed to show any genuine interest in Jamie (the bullies in 'Carrie', for instance, were far more involved), so it made Jamie look almost like a paranoid drama queen.Landon's ex-girlfriend's character was horribly underdeveloped, not to mention the rest of the 'cool' clique -- they were just cardboard cut-outs with screen time of about 10 seconds. 95% of time time, the focus was on Jamie alone -- she was supposed to be likable, but so much emphasis on a single person renders you fed-up with - annoyed by - her.Mandy Moore was kind of miscast anyway. She doesn't pass for an outcast.The good thing is that this movie is not irritating or overly dumb (it's actually more or less watchable); the bad thing: very clich√©d, too predictable, and becomes boring very quickly.I'm giving it a rating this high, because Mandy Moore turned out to be surprisingly decent at acting. Far, far more than you'd ever expect from a not-very-successful pop singer.",6,0,0,31 March 2013
Slumdog Millionaire," Not Impressed! At All!
","I can't believe how ridiculously overrated this movie is! There is absolutely nothing of value here. The movie is an endless fest of violence, abuse, and aggression. Full of clich√©s, and totally over-the-top.I do not believe that this is an accurate portrayal of the less-fortunate in India.The plot holes were huge and plentiful. The whole movie feels pretentious.I did not think the acting was particularly good. And, for God's sake, why cast such unsuitable child actors? Is it possible that one can be so dark in their childhood, but when they grow up, their skin is at least 10 shades lighter? I don't think so.I did not feel any connection with any of the characters. They were so plastic and unnatural.I don't understand why this movie has received such tremendous praise. It's beyond me. I don't see anything remotely appealing about this boring atrocity.I don't think I've ever seen anything THIS lame and predictable. What is the point watching a movie, when you know exactly what and when is going to happen, and how it's going to end? The story is dull and not at all compelling. Total borefest.",1,2,4,12 April 2013
The Pursuit of Happyness," Great Acting!
","I gave this movie 10/10 based solely on the acting. I though all the actors were exceptional - especially little Jayden (whose talent, sadly, seems to have evaporated now that's he's a young adult). And Thandie Newton, whom I used to regard as a well-below-average actress, was absolutely marvellous in this (though her character was severely under-developed). Will Smith was semi-believable for one -- playing an actual character (as opposed to just being Will Smith, like in most of his movies).As for the movie itself... well, it's a somewhat touching story, and the lead character is likable and charismatic enough to make you want to root for him, but, lets face it, - the story is over-dramatized. It is highly unlikely that something like that would happen in real life.There were several things that weren't explained properly. For example, - why continue renting a two-story house if you're 3 months behind with the rent already? What's wrong with getting an apartment, or even a room in a house with shared facilities, for example? Thousands of families in the US live in conditions that are much worse than Chris's, and many of them are single parents -- some with several children.Why continue selling something that you can clearly see does not sell? What's wrong with getting a job -- any job? At a supermarket, warehouse, or even as a janitor or something; at this point, for Chris, any income would've been better than no income at all.How come someone as smart as Chris ended up in these circumstances to begin with? Plus, I did have a problem with the message of this movie, which clearly is: 'money equates happiness'. Chris's idealization of the wealthy (and his trying to get next to them by sucking up) was a bit disturbing, actually.Well, the message could also be interpreted differently, of course -- 'shoot for the stars, be the best you can be, don't settle for less, etc.', but I didn't really see it that way. Why couldn't he just get a regular job, or even try and start his own *legitimate* business? All that energy spent on trying to sell those useless devices... surely, with his smarts and charisma, he could get any other job or do well as a business-man.But stock broker? It is not exactly something I would call a profession, and it's certainly not something one would refer to as 'honest' or 'hard' work -- not sure what reason, other than the obvious one (i.e. money), one could possibly have to aspire to work in a boiler room, making money by ripping off others...Given these arguments, you start to question the integrity and likability of the protagonist. And also - the climax was somewhat disappointing.But anyway... it's definitely an entertaining movie, well-worth seeing. And, like I said, the acting is impeccable.",10,1,2,12 September 2015
Cinderella Man," An Inspirational, Moving Story...
","Obviously, if you want to see a movie about actual boxing, this is not the one for you. The story is about a struggling boxer and the great depression; boxing itself is not the focal point. But it DOES have more ring scenes than 'Rocky'...Movies like 'Cinderella Man' tend to have one major issue: they often feel too ritzy, which renders them unconvincing. This was one of the few movies that managed to portray the period of the great depression very believably. The movie is quite atmospheric and has a genuine feel of despair to it.The acting is impeccable. In the beginning, I was not sure about Renee Z.; they didn't seem to be a good match, but both actors are very good, so they pulled it off. The chemistry was probably fake, but it was present. The supporting actors, including the kids, were also very good.The movie was not exactly suspenseful, but there were practically no cheesy moments and it wasn't predictable, which is something I greatly appreciate in a film. There was some humour, too. All in all, the movie feels realistic, the story is compelling, and the lead characters are likable and charismatic.A heart-warming, inspirational movie. Definitely worth adding to your movie collection, even if you're not a huge fan of drama.",10,1,2,27 April 2013
