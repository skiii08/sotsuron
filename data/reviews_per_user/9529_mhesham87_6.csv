The Lobster," Why didn't I watch this movie before ?
","Very Amusing. At the end I did not want it to end. 
Smart ideas. Great Acting. This movie should have won gold.",9,1,2,23 January 2018
Blade Runner 2049," Why ??
","So I watched this one with high hopes as I like the director's previous work like incendes. But just as we enter the second half hour I ask myself : WHY ? 
First of all you have to see the first chapter which was released 35 years ago ?? 
And that's not just that, you have to see that blackout movie too. 
Now ok we are at the middle of the movie so no time to be dissapointed. Why is Leto in this movie at all ? How and why did K go to that old place to find old Ford there ? What happened to the army which is intended to start a revolution? 
What the hell is wrong with that scene at the sea ? 
Why a wanted cop like K walks to the place where the best memories creator is without any single guard at the door ?
The cinematography was great... That's it.",5,2,3,20 January 2018
Black Swan," One of the Greatest movies I ever watched.
","Darren Is my favorite director now. I saw mother and I saw the black swan poster and thought, lets see this one too. 
It is one of the best movies in my opinion.
It is about growing up. That is what the movie is all about. Yet the experience of this little sentence is very big at the movie.
Natalie was perfect. The ending scenes were just great.
I would like to watch a movie like this every now and then.",10,1,2,20 January 2018
Wind River," Very good performance by the cast... Yet I wanted more.
","A girl found dead in the middle of snow.. FBI agent comes to investigate with the aid of a local hunter. They found the girl's boyfriend dead in the snow also.. they suspect his colleagues and the final shocking scene is revealed. 
Very sad ending. Very good performance by all actors. I wanted more to come actually. More investigation more action between the characters.
Good movie.",7,0,1,3 January 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," It was an amazing movie... Very entertaining.
","It was great. I really did not intend to watch it. I was actually heading to the cinema just to see what is showing, then I saw the poster and decided yeah what the hell let's see it. After the break I found that I really liked the movie and did not want it to end.I am not a fan of the potter series but this movie is a stand alone world.Dan Fogler was great and the witch sister also ( I do not know what her name is ) was really great. Redmayne did not impress me much and actually he did not talk much. Yet the whole crew created a good combination. The ending was not that great for me. Did not get what Johnny is doing here and why. But overall, Amazing.",9,2,6,22 November 2016
The Shape of Water," Enjoyable...Predictable
","The movie is enjoyable. Michael Shannon was great. Yet we all know what will happen anyway through out the movie.
A LOT of nudity and sex scenes with no obvious need actually. Could have worked more on the relationship between the girl and the shape.
Cinematography is great.. Music was great.",5,3,6,13 January 2018
