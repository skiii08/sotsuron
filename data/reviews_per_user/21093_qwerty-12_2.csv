Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Another Star Wars Movie
","This is Star Wars.  For me, this movie is just like the old Star Wars movies.  It follows the same formula that the old ones did, by this I mean that it unfolds in the same way as the others.  Yes, special effects are the main focus, but was that any different, say, in A New Hope.  That movie is about rescuing a damsel in distress...not very original or creative.  But the effects and characters take your mind off that just like in this new installment.  Darth Maul is absolutely wonderful and I just can't wait to see what Palpatine will do next.  The Phantom Menace is filled with the same fun spirit of campy adventurism that was so prominent in the earlier movies. This is just another Star Wars Movie, and like the others...it's spectacular!",5,0,1,25 May 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The best film ever!
","In my opinion, Dr. Strangelove is the best film ever made. In no other movie is Peter Sellers acting extraordinary acting talent apparent as it is here.  Stanley Kubrick outdoes all his other brilliant films with this one.  George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and Sterling Hayden give excellent performances as well.  This movie is hillarious, yet scary and it is completed by the best ending in movie history.  The characters are memorable and the direction is great.  This is, without a doubt, the best movie ever!",10,1,1,14 May 1999
