Mission: Impossible III," Good movie, hate the shaky cam
","I really like the mi series and anyone who likes action should as well. It is everything that James Bond meant to me as a kid. My negatives of the movie is that It has the shaky camera effect as did Bourne supremacy - I think this technique is a real cop out, It may just be me but I cant see what is happening and with special effects so good these days it is unnecessary . Hoffman was amazing and should have had a bigger part. Anyway if you like action movies go and see it. Tom Cruise is a real professional when it comes to these types of movies and it shines through.",7,35,65,6 May 2006
