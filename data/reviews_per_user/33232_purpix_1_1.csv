The Blair Witch Project," A welcome return to 'old school' techniques.
","This film is a welcome return to the 'old school' techniques of making horror films. A 90's film with such suspense, Hitchcock would have been proud. The directors of this film went back to basics in a big way, and in so doing have scored one of the most innovative and smart films to come along in a very long, long time. The only thing that might hurt this film come Oscar nomination time, is the fact that it is a horror film. It deserves all of the accolades and recognition it no doubt will garner however. A true HORROR film in every sense of the word. There were moments during which you could have heard a pin drop in the theatre. The audience was totally captivated by this film. One of the most powerful films in terms of sheer emotional content, in at least a couple of decades. Maybe longer.Brilliant concept. Brilliant story. Brilliant acting. Will definitely make you think twice about ever going camping again. The last scene alone will probably haunt you for a good time to come. An instant 'Classic' that just may be the best horror film ever made. Imagination is a scary thing.",10,1,2,31 July 1999
