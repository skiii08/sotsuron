Captain Phillips," Well told story will keep you on the edge of your seat
","I'm from Vermont and I've lived in Boston for over twenty years so I know my New England accents and I'd actually like to ask Tom Hanks what he was doing with the accent he came up with for this movie. It was like someone from Maine imitating an old person from Boston, poorly. I thought his accent was going to annoy me all the way through the movie but it didn't. The movie is so well made and the basic story is so captivating that I forgot about his accent very quickly. The movie's plot line is quite focused. There are no odd little side dramas to take away from the main story. I found 'Captain Philips' to be quite refreshing in that it was an action thriller without the fake melodrama or over the top violence.",8,0,1,25 January 2014
Doctor Zhivago," Greatest Movie of all Time
","I love this movie. It could be used to teach a course in cinematography. Just the opening scene is stunning. The movie opens with a far shot of a funeral; snow covered mountains loom over the participants. You're reminded of ancient Japanese art where humans are shown to be a minor part of nature. That's a recurring theme here. One of the main characters is also introduced, Mother Russia. You can't forget for a minute that this story is about Russia.All the elements of a great movie are here and they all fall into place perfectly, the cinematography, the story, the acting and the music. This is what epic film making is all about.If you understand what the difference between a book a movie is, you will love this film.",10,1,2,25 January 2014
