Saturday Night Fever," Loneliness & elation rolled into a film reflecting its era.
","It's funny how people remember a film they are reminiscing about. An example would be 'Muriel's Wedding' - a film that is labeled as a comedy. And yet it is one of the saddest & most realistic films about family life that has been made. When you remember the film, its moments of humour are so clever, that they hide the dark undercurrents explored.The same goes for 'Saturday Night Fever' (SNF), a film that showcases disco in its most perfect form. And yet the true theme of the movie is about wanting more out of your life but just existing, until something affects you so much that you decide to start living.John Travolta's character is so well played against his friends who are, quite simply, cruel no hopers who disrespect the opposite sex & treat them as fifth best against the car they all share to have 'mobile' sex in.The female character that eventually shifts Travolta's character appears at a time when horrific events really force him to reassess where he is going Â– something that his friends will never be unable to ever do.It is easy to label a movie a certain way. There are films with similar themes such as 'Good Will Hunting', which is noted for its themes & dialogue rather than being a kitsch memory, and we should remember SNF for the same reasons.",Null,5,6,19 November 2004
Fight Club," Pulls punches & not just with the fist.
","The first time watching 'Fight Club', you may be confronted not necessarily by the violence, but by the freshness of language, imagery & sounds that smack your senses & reach your inner most thoughts.Having now seen it many times, I see it from a new perspective each time & this is thanks, in part, to both Edward Norton & Helena Bonham-Carter. This film reflects the career path they have both chosen to take; far from run of the mill & definitely brilliant.David Fincher is a director who has the ability to create visually stunning films and at the same time play on raw, human emotions. In a world where violence inflicted on others is promoted in the media as a way to increase audience ratings figures, 'Fight Club' is a refreshing change. Perhaps if we start feeling again & realize our own failings & accept ourselves as we are instead of trying to be Mr or Miss Perfect, then maybe we'll be more accepting of others as well.",Null,1,3,25 August 2004
