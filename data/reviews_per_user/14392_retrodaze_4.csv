The Sound of Music," An innocence that is lost in the present day world...
","The fact that there are actually very negative reviews of this movie shows that this world is really too far gone...'Classic' cannot even begin to describe something this magical. The simple fact that most people can remember it coming on television only once or twice a year throughout most of the 70's and 80's only served to make it that much more treasured. I'm sure like many others, it was a family event to sit down and watch this film on those occasions on a Sunday afternoon - those were the days... Guess I'm biased having loved the movie since early childhood, but how anyone can hate it is BEYOND me. You truly must have a heart of solid rock not to be effected by the gut-wrenching storyline, timeless music, and breathtaking cinematography. A real masterpiece.Yet for some strange reason, it has escaped most movie reviewers top ten lists - why? I guess some dont want to 'admit' to liking it because it's a musical...oh well. You could do far worse for a guilty pleasure. But No.55 on AFI's top 100 list? - What's up with that? Films like this should be required viewing for Generations X through Z, if you enjoyed it as others have, pass it on.",Null,0,5,20 April 2002
Moulin Rouge!," My daring ENCOUNTER with 'MOULIN ROUGE'
","It must be said that  a standing ovation, and world-wide recognition must be given to someone who had a great influence on the outcome of this film....And the award goes too...... (drumroll please).....The amazing, the fantastic, the incredible.....PLASTIC SURGEON who worked on Nicole's b@@bies! YAY! CHEERS! WHOO-HOO!! AND THE CROWD GOES WILD!!! A masterful job if there ever was oneThose two inspired me to continue to watch from beginning to end - through all the sappy-yet-sometimes-really-cool love songs, the ridiculous casting of Ewan McBoringCantSingSoTheyDubbedOverWithTheVoiceofA20YearOldSopranoWhoSoundsNothingLikeMeGregor, and the greased-lightning fast camera cuts through the opening 20 minutes. Yes, through it all, there they stood, proud, magnificent, defiant, and against the wind like a bulwark to a raging storm. Unfortunately, the film got better. And better. And better. Soon I found myself in a quandry.....torn between staring at the close-ups of Nicole, or ACTUALLY paying attention to the increasingly interesting film. Understanding there was no way I could preform both at the same time, alas, I eventually gave in and watched the movie, knowing full well that I would never overreach yonder mountains in this lifetime anyway. Undaunted, I proudly went back to the guys at the office, held my head up high and said..YES! I sat through an entire MUSICAL....and I LIKED it!
Suffice it to say that all in all, they,...um... I mean.. it, was indeed, a Spectacular Spectacular!! >:-)",Null,3,4,23 April 2002
Reservoir Dogs," What a Pathetic, Sad, State of Affairs...
","this world must be in, for this non-sensical pile of drivel to garner this much positive attention.It never fails in modern-day cinema, that whenever over-the-top gory, pointless violence is dressed up in hip clothing, and wrapped around so-called 'cool' fast dialogue, that every Mutton-headed, knuckle scraping Baboon with an internet connection, a keyboard, and a desire to be as 'hip' as the idiots they heap their praise on, will show up and make excuses for it. Inspiring?, as one reviewer mentioned? Puh-lease. If this garbage is where you look to for ANY kind of inspiration, you're even worse off than first believed. Dont see this movie, unless you believe true 'art' can be supplanted by the shallow surface of today's jaded gen-x-speak, a fast soundtrack, and neo camera work. A less painful alternative to seeing this? - try performing open heart surgery...on yourself!",Null,1,3,8 October 2002
