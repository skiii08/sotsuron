Hereditary," So creepy
","I am not a fan of most possession movies however this movie was creepy as hell! The whole movie was intense and crazy! I felt sadness, horror and shock while watching this movie. The ending was different than I expected but still loved it! The acting was excellent and if you are looking for a good scare I recommend this movie!",9,1,4,24 September 2018
