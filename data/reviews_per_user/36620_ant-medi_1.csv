Blade Runner 2049," Beautiful
","Blade Runner 2049 has given me something that I never knew I always wanted. I don't think this movie is for everyone of course but for me it was perfect. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. There were many very cool shots and this movie has a very different look and feel than the original 1982 Blade Runner, but it was Blade Runner none the less. The performances were really good, one way this movie was a lot like the original was the sound design. There were 2 scenes in the movie where I felt 'Oh I've seen something exactly like this in another movie' but they weren't that big of a problem. Compared to all the new reboots of older movies this was something very special that I did not see coming. Denis Villeneuve has officially made his way into history as one of the great directors of our time, I have to really say I was very surprised I didn't think it would be that great, since I am such a huge fan of the original Blade Runner, especially the Final Cut of it. After this being a disappointing year for movies except for a few great ones, Blade Runner 2049 gives me hope that there can be great films in our future. I hope that if you watch it you enjoy it.",10,7,18,8 October 2017
