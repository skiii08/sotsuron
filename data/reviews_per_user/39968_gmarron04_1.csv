Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," what a film top marks must see!!
",Excellent film a must see i could not stop laughing. Neither could the audience at the cinema.I will be definitely buying this film when it comes out. If u like comedy you will certainly love this full of humour and only miserable people would not like this film.Just so funny all the way though and the characters are really funny. Borat does a nice job here and it well funny. On how different people live and find it hard to adapt in different culture's and countries. I love the bit where Borat fighting with his friend on the bed i could not stop laughing. The cinema loved this and i'm sure who goes to see it will too.Gaz Bham,10,1,15,7 November 2006
