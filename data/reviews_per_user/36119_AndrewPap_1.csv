Requiem for a Dream," ~An Afflictive Cinematic Diamond~
","Νοτ a single thing about happiness in this gold masterpiece named Requiem For A Dream.With A very strong,emotional and inexorable directing from a genius and great director as Darren Aronofsky.There's so much pain,sadness and strong emotions with a very realistic way about the world we all leave in and a very hard social message about drugs and not only drugs but all the species of addictions such as T.V. and other stuff.The Performances are all great with top of all Ellen Burstin with her best performance of her life.She is shocking and heartbreaking.To sum up this movie is great a true masterpiece and in my opinion this movie must be seen by every person and especially teenagers about its social message.GREAT",10,2,3,25 September 2014
