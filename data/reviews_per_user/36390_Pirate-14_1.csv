The Blair Witch Project," Horror movie? Try horrible movie.
","That movie was so weak if it was a a true story they should have left the footage lost. First of all you don't go in to the wood looking for a witch without any kind of defense. The movie was just so horrible I almost got sick and walked out. My advice to anyone who hasn't seen it, don't waste an hour and thirty minutes of your life you should have better things to do.",Null,0,0,6 August 1999
