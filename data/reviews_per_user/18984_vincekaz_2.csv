Source Code," Fine and interesting
","This movie is a pleasant viewing experience that delivers a well developed plot that I found to be quite engaging, that is the good partÂ….I did find that the story lacked a bit of creativity in terms of thrills and suspense but Jake Gyllenhaal did a fantastic job at keeping me interested right till the end. Parallels have been drawn with 'inception' by some reviews before me but I think they are exaggerated 'Source code' is a good watch but doesn't possess the heart thumping edge of your seat suspense that we got from Nolan's masterpiece.You must watch this movie because I was particularly caught by surprise by one sad twist in the tale that I am sure will find interesting too.I'd say seven stars for great acting and some really fine dialogue.",7,1,3,11 April 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Nice but I've seen better
","What I liked about this movie was the ensemble of actors that provided what by any standards was a fine display of talent, Matt Damon (who never disappoints), Emily Blunt and Terence stamp were remarkable, they surprisingly held together a plot that would have been flat and dour but for their extraordinary skill.The premise is good but the delivery poor, I liked the idea of a bureau that controls world destiny, but the dudes I saw in the movie could have been more slick more bad ass, when I finally settled down to accepting what was on the plate I realized half way through that nothing big was going to happen the story is simply about the bureau trying to keep Blunt's and Damon's characters apart.So I settled down to enjoying the romance and chemistry while waiting for a unique twist at the end, well there was none and the anti climax was not block buster worthy.I'd say watch the movie but don't hold your breath.",5,2,4,6 April 2011
