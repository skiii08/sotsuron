The King's Speech," Royally rousing
","Tom 'The Damned United' Hooper's tub-thumping biopic concerns Prince Albert, a frustrated stammerer who would become King George VI on the eve of the Second World War, following his hedonistic brother Edward's (Guy Pearce) tipple-topple from the throne.The script may be as sharp as a Stanley knife, but in the end, for all its tears, both joyful and sad, this is a mostly simple and predictable movie with a softness and stageyness occasionally at odds with its own sense of grandeur and the grim era it depicts. Which isn't to dismiss it as fluffy or irrelevant.Some critics have complained that the film comes across as royalist. But this is a decidedly personal story; that the ramifications of the events have far-reaching consequences serves to enhance the universality of the condition and the cure. In short, putting a plot in a palace is a fast-track to an exaggerated reality. The tragedy is that Bertie is a shrunken man when the country wants BIG.Hooper has directed a reluctant leader before, in the form of John Adams. The sense of self-doubt harboured by the Second President may have been somewhat more subtly portrayed – but then Paul Giamatti did have 500 minutes to do it. So, given the breadth of the journey, Firth's performance is masterful: the physical, externalised flip-side to A Single Man's taut, internal anguish. Rush is solid as ever as the aphoristic Lionel Logue, while Helena Bonham-Carter has a hoot as the snappy Queen Mother.In possibly the film's best scene, while mending a model aeroplane, Bertie speaks of his younger brother, the epileptic Johnny. My mind was flung back to Stephen Poliakoff's The Lost Prince (also featuring a gruff if slightly more avuncular Michael Gambon), which was the better, more challenging film. But Hooper's film is an enjoyable, unapologetic crowd-pleaser nonetheless.",6,4,9,18 January 2011
Black Swan," Monstrous elegance
","In typical genre-jumbling style, Darren Aronofsky's fifth feature contains elements of sports drama, horror and operatic romance. The result is a fraught, frightening film about the pursuit of perfection; one that does not concern itself with the experience of watching ballet, but rather the various forms of violence that go into preparing for and performing it.Nina (Natalie Portman) is chosen by Thomas (Vincent Cassel) to be the Black and White Swans in his re-imagining of Swan Lake. She effortlessly embodies the elegance and fragility of the former role, but can she delve into her dark side, and nail the latter? The arrival of Lily (Mila Kunis), all sensuality and laissez-faire, not to mention a whole bunch of talent, triggers a vicious rivalry and sets Nina's inner runaway train down the tracks.A lesser film may have focused on the suggestion that the whole dreadful rivalry may be some twisted training device masterminded by the 'genius', Thomas. But Aronofsky wisely focuses on the most interesting characters - not Nina and Lily, but Nina and Nina. The fact that Nina is evidently unhinged from the first frame lends the film a slightly monotone quality. But it's far, far from predictable.That the pursuit presents a path to derangement will not come as a surprise to fans of the director's debut, Pi, while fans of Requiem for a Dream will find the escalating, claustrophobic chaos of the later scenes familiar. Aronofsky seems most at home when he's commanding an anarchic narrative through a warped aesthetic. This probably explains why his most grounded film, The Wrestler, which most closely resembles the real world - as opposed to the world as seen through his protagonist's eyes - feels the least his own.Black Swan is a deserved Oscar contender (if you believe in that sort of thing) and the work of a consistently impressive auteur.",7,1,3,26 January 2011
Captain Phillips," I'm just a cook...
","Cinema has come a long way since Under Siege. The titular hero of this story is no expert in hand-to-hand or weapons and tactics. He's definitely not a cook.Tom Hanks is Richard Phillips, captain of the Alabama cargo ship, en route to Mombasa via Somali no-man's water. Muse (impressive newcomer Barkhad Abdi) arrives with a handpicked crew of pirates, and they board the Alabama. Nail-biting tension and hostage-taking will follow. It's best that one goes into the film knowing no more.Paul Greengrass is the best director working today in the authentic documentary aesthetic. He knows that the drama is in the detail. Captain Phillips' most thrilling moments are when Greengrass is most exacting and pedantic about characters' relative positions within the environment. That sounds kind of formal, but then Greengrass's shaky-cam does veil an essential precision. He focuses on the immediate situation, leaving us the viewers to picture it in the wider political context.As with Kathryn Bigelow, Greengrass's anti-polemical style is occasionally a curse but mostly a blessing. The action may occur on the surface, but there's depth beneath the objectivity – perhaps best encapsulated in the image of three mighty US warships surrounding a tiny craft in international waters.The implicit themes are globalisation and imperialism. The opportunism of the pirates is met with a defence based on an escalating chain of command. It's chaos versus structure; improvisation versus meticulous contingency planning. Money is nothing without an entrenched system to contain it and protect it. Sorry, Africa – we'll throw food parcels in your direction but we won't help you build long-term infrastructure plans, and you sure as hell can't step on 'our' turf.When the pirates are first approaching the Alabama, Muse presents his gang as seaborne law enforcers, and I couldn't help thinking of the United States' assumed position as 'world police'...More than anything, Captain Phillips reminds us of the power of Hanks and Greengrass, two servants of cinema at the absolute top of their game, and that should be recommendation enough. It's worth paying to see – please don't pirate it!",7,33,60,24 October 2013
Skyfall," Question of Sport
","We can all pretend that Quantum of Solace never happened. But how does Skyfall compare with Casino Royale? Daniel Craig's Bond debut was an exquisitely made, neat and nasty exercise in sexual and violent tension which brought Bond bang up to date. But reboots are always at an advantage - the filmmakers have a pre-stocked toy box of tropes and expectations to play with. Skyfall, on the other hand, comes four years after a dud, with a director more suited to symbolism than stunts. Barbara Broccoli and MGM need Skyfall to be a success, lest the series is dragged back into the obscurity of the Dalton era or the preposterousness of latter Brosnan.After the stylised pyrotechnics of Road to Perdition, the war-inside war film Jarhead, and the masterful but talky Revolutionary Road, one might expect that director Sam Mendes would put the brakes on Bond. But the 143 minutes fly by. If anything, I found myself longing for more. More time constructing the icy relationships between Bond, M (Judi Dench) and Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), and more time sparring with Bond and Silva (Javier Bardem).Bardem's magnificent monster (part Hannibal Lecter, part Anton Chigurh, part Joker, making an entrance like Frank-N-Furter) appears at first to be an offensive, old-fashioned equation: campness = homosexuality = evil. But then great writing makes sense of the love triangle. Silva adores M (for Mother), but feels betrayed by her. Silva is expressing the repressed abandonment issues felt by Bond. And the relationship between M and Bond is precisely the mother-son bond (!) coveted by Silva.Even more interestingly, Silva seems to embody Bond's deepest fears. With a threatening caress, Silva directly challenges our hero's ferocious heterosexuality; and he's secretly deformed, while Bond possesses a paranoid obsession with physical perfection. Silva is the expression of the scared little boy hiding behind the 'cool' facade; the child who could never grow up, still playing with the toys that Mummy allows him, and still sulking when he's told off.The dynamic between Bond and Silva takes the film in the thematic direction of The Dark Knight. And why not? This new Bond is as conflicted and repressive as Batman; damaged goods doing good in a modern world that promises safety and intimacy but provides neither. But while the final act of Nolan's flawed opus went wildly awry, Bond 23 ends entirely appropriately for a 50-year celebration, by returning to its beginnings. The raw, stripped-down finale recalls Straw Dogs' final storm. With its dwindling characters cast black against its fiery backdrop, it's as primal and mythic as Bond himself.The only missteps are when it feels like the filmmakers seem to feel the need to actively remind us that we are watching James Bond and not The Dark Knight, such the casino fight scene that ends with a cheesy reptilian death. Typically Bond, maybe, yet it comes straight after an atypical, empathic exchange between Bond and Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) about her induction into child prostitution and the imprisoning nature of fear.Overall, it would be a hard task to name a more satisfying or sophisticated Bond film. Budding screenwriters should take a leaf out of the screenwriters' (Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan) book: the last line spoken by M in this movie is an absolute killer, bursting with meaning without spelling it out; a reminder that, in a world of pragmatists and assassins, love is expressed in actions, and the significance is in the subtext.",8,3,9,29 October 2012
Iron Man 3," Tin Man
","The first Iron Man was an unexpected delight. The second Iron Man was the perfunctory comic book movie we thought the first was going to be. And now here comes Iron Man 'Three' (I'm not sure why it's not numerical). Tony Stark (an increasingly bored- and bitter-looking Robert Downey Jr), traumatised by the events of Avengers Assemble, taunts a bonkers terrorist megastar named The Mandarin (an amusing Ben Kingsley, wholly self-mocking), who then proceeds to blow up the Stark empire. So, rather than the franchise going bigger and badder, and rather than a potentially intriguing P.R. head-to-head between the world's two greatest egomaniacs, we get a kind of origins tale. Again. I wanted to like Iron Man 'Three', mostly because it represents the final piece of the Shane Black resurrection puzzle (the puzzle being why he hasn't been consistently at the forefront of wisecracking blockbuster Hollywood ever since Lethal Weapon), but I could only let it pass harmlessly over me. It has stacks of great ideas and some whizzy dialogue, but it's also tonally erratic, narratively reckless and overlong. And I can't help feeling that the fanboy-angering twist in the middle might simply be there to make up for the lack of an interesting bad guy.This feels like a good place to leave the standalone Iron Man movies, although Stan Lee's money-making machine shows no sign of slowing, especially now that he's realised that the Chinese are lapping up his solid, gaudy entertainments like there's no tomorrow. Just because the returns this time aren't as diminished as part two, that doesn't mean we need a fourth. All good things come in threes. Except The Godfather.",5,8,19,28 April 2013
Spartacus," Undeniably Kubrick
","Spartacus has come to be regarded as something of an unknown entity in the Kubrick canon. He was an auteur who always claimed a writing credit; so on the surface this Kirk Douglas-produced Roman epic might appear to be a simple vanity project for its star after his failure to land the part of Ben-Hur.But Kubrick was clearly able to imprint his personality on the finished product: lengthy tracking shots and static long shots framed like classical paintings; meticulous lighting and chessboard floors. And not every director would pick up on screenwriter Dalton Trumbo's intelligent irony and subtext.Peter Ustinov has spoken of the lack of a Christ figure, and I would say this is to the movie's advantage. How easy it would have been to present Spartacus, self-proclaimed leader of the common man, as a figure to be deified, and the fawning poor as his disciples. But that would have cheapened the message, and patronised his followers to the extent that they become effectively imprisoned once more by blind allegiance. Indeed, religion is rarely mentioned at all; if it had been then the already murky politics would be muddied further and we would be watching a 5-hour cut.The cast is a colourful bunch. Douglas exudes a fierce and believable masculinity as the titular titan. Classical quality is provided by Laurence Olivier (Crassus), Charles Laughton (Gracchus) and the peerless Ustinov, whose Batiatus is the perfect rodent, snivelling somewhere between the stricken slave-world and the sinister senate. (A similar but arguably richer character than, say, Gladiator's Proximo.) The casting of Tony Curtis is less successful: his broad Bronx accent and dark heavy features aren't well suited to Antoninus' doe-eyed, silver-tongued minstrel.Speaking of heavy, Alex North's bombastic score is deafening; triumphant or obnoxious depending on your ear drums. (North would later commission an unused score for Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, before his work was replaced by memorable pieces from Strauss, Ligeti et al.) One could argue that Jean Simmons' Varinia is little more than a pretty plot device for much of the movie - a foil for Spartacus' rampant rage; proof that he is not merely D-Fens in a loincloth - but she comes alive in the final scenes, providing some much-needed hope in the devastating climactic meeting.Intelligent, broad of scope, cynical, horrifying and beautiful: this is truly a Kubrick war movie.",7,1,5,12 April 2010
Gravity," Empty space
","I just don't get it. I've watched Gravity twice now. I'm seeing the lovely long takes, the exquisite vertiginous photography, and the clever sound design. I'm receiving the magnificent special effects loud and clear. But I'm not getting anything else from the film. When the praise for an artwork is so unanimously glowing, you find yourself either wanting to love it or inclined to hate it. But with Gravity, for me, it's worse than that: I find it mediocre. It's a classy space-based smash-'em-up for those who couldn't bear to admit enjoying J.J. Abrams' Star Trek movies.The film is written by the director's son, Jonas Cuarón. The story concerns a rookie engineer, Ryan Stone (a solid, nappy-free Sandra Bullock), who we meet being guided through a Hubble mission by old-hand Matt Kowalski (a woefully miscast George Clooney, going full Buzz Lightyear). Soon the news comes over the radio that a cloud of debris is racing toward their position 'as fast as a high-speed bullet' (as opposed to a sluggish bullet?). 90 minutes of spinning, dancing chaos ensues.Alfonso Cuarón proved in 2006, with Children of Men, that he could push the boundaries of action cinema whilst also portraying interesting characters in a rich narrative. Gravity does the action stuff brilliantly, but the script is a B-movie stinker and the characters are... well, like film stars playing astronauts. Dotted throughout the film is beautiful imagery, but it's either irrelevant (Ryan curling into a floating foetal position) or accompanied by Clooney verbally informing us it's beautiful. These characters make the sight of the sunrise bland.Imagine the zero-gravity scenes from 2001: A Space Odyssey stretched to an entire film. (Albeit with more explosions and a lot more gasping.) Kubrick was attempting to depict the complacency of humankind; how technology had drained the awe from our species. I'm not sure what the Cuaróns are up to here, beyond giving us a very elaborate and expensive tech demo. Are they simply trying to make us experience a visceral thrill, or is there something deeper? Something about the way we humans are forever spinning away and towards each other? Alas, father and son are only here to elaborate on the physical realm, not the psychological, philosophical, or spiritual. For that reason, I can't see this 'pure cinema' experience being one that will improve on the small screen.",5,1,2,28 December 2013
Akira," The silver lining in the mushroom cloud
","There's a vast allegory here - a post-Hiroshima distrust of the wheels of industry - that runs through a lot of modern manga, from Doomed Megalopolis, through Patlabor 1 & 2, to Katsuhiro Otomo's own Steamboy. (More recently, with films like Ghost In the Shell 1 & 2, the dominant fear has been of a kind of hidden cyber-apocalypse.) But the urban apocalypse was most powerfully and poetically realised with Akira. Otomo's movie, based on his own manga comic, clocks in at over two hours; it is a dramatically arresting epic. It's also visually sumptuous. Remember this was 1988, before the CG revolution - the huge images contain herein would have been impossible to recreate 'live'.Some might resent the characters' lack of personality. Indeed, they're far less outwardly expressive than the more caricatured efforts found in, say, Wings of Honneamise or Metropolis. But Akira is not concerned with sentimentalising its characterisation. Key players are wantonly dispatched amongst Tokyo's toppling tower blocks - Tetsuo's (Nozomu Sasaki) girlfriend, the ghost-white Kaori (Yuriko Fuchizaki), for all her stubbornness and pleading, is a vessel of tragedy. The closest we get to an intimate relationship is between Tetsuo and Kaneda (Mitsuo Iwata), although ultimately even this comes down to some nuclear-fuelled fisticuffs. This is not to say that Akira's characterisation is lacking - far from it. In fact, the psychological plight of Colonel Shikishima (Taro Ishida) as he realises the folly of his lust for power, and then his subsequent forgiveness, is moving; likewise, the horrible ordeals of the ever-young 'Espers' gives their final sacrifice added poignancy.There are murmurs of a live action remake of Akira (at one point with Stephen 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' Norrington attached). Quite apart from the intrinsic pointlessness (unless your point is profit) behind remaking perfectly good films, what will become of the original's real trump card: namely its sheer unhindered scope? Here is a movie which not only dares to look the apocalypse in the eye, but even shows us what lies beyond. What will it sound like, for instance, as Kaneda's bike rolls across the empty road bridge towards the ruins of neo-Toyko, when Shia LaBeouf utters those simple yet profound words, 'I am Tetsuo'?",8,0,2,12 April 2010
The Maze Runner," A-maze-ingly tedious
","Remember Vincenzo Natali's 1997 film, Cube? Bold. Mysterious. Smartly written. Knowingly silly. Imperfect but unique. Well, The Maze Runner is nothing like that, except for the imperfections. Remember, also, M Night Shyamalan's last (almost) great movie, The Village? Something of that film's central conceit is at work here – albeit emptied of any intelligence or detectable allegory or any semblance of a distinctive style.Teen Wolf's Dylan O'Brien stars as Thomas, who wakes up just as he's being deposited in an enormous prison called the Glade. He can remember nothing of his former life. Nor can the other young male denizens of the Glade, who've been ritually plonked there on a monthly basis, and have been mapping the surrounding maze ever since. Problem is, the maze keeps shifting shape, and after dark it is occupied by menacing Grievers: arachnid guardians made of guts and steel. Thomas wants to find a way to freedom, but Gally (Will Poulter) reckons they should stay put, where it's safe. Shouting ensues, while the Gladers ask endless, unanswered questions about what the Glade is, what the maze is, what the Grievers are, when the film's going to end This is the worst kind of mystery setup. A Lost-esque cloak envelopes everyone and everything, giving all the power to the filmmakers and leaving none of the fun to us. In a TV show this would hold us to the next ad break. Here, it's meant to hold our attention into the next movie (already announced), despite the fact that the first instalment barely crawls to 113 minutes. The whole concept just doesn't hold water. At least The Hunger Games has a flamboyance of design to distract us from its barely credible dystopia. But The Maze Runner is way too serious for that. Spoiler alert (although is it a spoiler when it's this predictable?): We're told that the kids are being put through some sort of Darwinian test to establish their suitability in a post-apocalyptic world. The conspiratorial nature of this boring beast means we can't take this explanation at face-value. But then, I've nothing else to go on, and I'm certainly not compelled to read the books – so let's go with what we've got, which is eye-narrowingly contrived nonsense.The script is deathly dull. It starts with a cavalcade of exposition, setting up the rules etc, and descends into mindless arguing, without ever daring to explore, say, the sexual politics of having a girl thrown into this hyper-masculine teenage mix. The amnesia thing is the oldest cheat in the screen writing book, and causes a crippling lack of character. Our hero is running on some kind of instinct but he's still basically a Nice Young Man. No moral grey areas here. The dearth of character is consistent with the video game level of narrative: Choose your player based solely on appearance (also the casting process here, it seems).Another homogenous hero, then. And sub-par performances abound. The only player to really engage is Game of Thrones' Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt; the only character to imply any kind of internal conflict. I concede that Will Poulter puts in solid work, too. But generally the cast is directed with bland efficiency. The action scenes are all bluster and no invention and the CGI is as weightless as it comes. Who said Hollywood was a world of talented hacks? I'm not sure, but I'm saying it now. It's a pity because John Paesano's score evokes John Williams – he deserved Spielberg for his work.The film drills standard YA anxieties about identity, victimhood, and entitlement; about not being 'special' (or divergent or whatever) and slipping anonymously into the crowd. Worst of all, there's absolutely no chance of getting any phone signal in the Glade. The horror! Against the classy Orwellian operatics of The Hunger Games, here's a wannabe without substance, style, or, ironically, identity.",3,2,4,11 November 2014
Iron Man 2," Falling Stark
","Watching Iron Man 2 is kind of like observing a largely bloodless car crash while someone provides amusing narration. The plot is a wheeling mess, but the film is rescued by a lively, screwball script and some sharp improvisation from an ensemble of talented performers. Least amongst them is Mickey Rourke as the vengeful Ivan Vanko, in a performance that belongs to a far darker movie. Indeed, his scenes highlight the film's frequent lurches from breezy to black, which, combined with an apparent explosion at the on-set minor character-making factory, create an experience far less satisfying than its simple-minded predecessor â€“ which itself was an ideal response to the 'darkening' of comic book adaptations brought about by the Nolan brothers.This sequel is best when it focuses on verbal sparring. Because, while Favreau is a competent director, he has people scenes and CGI scenes; he hasn't the skill of Jackson, Cameron or Spielberg at blending the human and the virtual. This leads, after some mecha gunplay straight out of Halo, to a disappointingly perfunctory final confrontation.After it's all over, one is left scratching one's head. What was the purpose of Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), besides laying multiple beds for multiple sequels? Why did Rhodes (Don Cheadle) overreact so dramatically at Stark's (Robert Downey Jr) birthday party? Was their ensuing bromantic tussle the sole trigger for Rhodes' subsequent robo-larceny? It all amounts to an overlong, overcomplicated, occasionally enjoyable disaster.",4,5,10,5 May 2010
World War Z," Planet of the Dead
","The smell of blood was in the air, and the critics were baying. Production problems, re-writes (including a third act restructuring by premier go-to-guy Damon Lindelof), and a ballooning budget - it spelled a disaster that would have the critics crawling over each other to find the funniest words to describe its dreadfulness. As with John Carter before it, how disappointing it must have been to be presented with a half-decent movie. This is a brisk global thriller with some nifty set-pieces and a dogged determination to tell a straightforward story.I haven't read the source novel by Max 'Son of Mel' Brooks, but by all accounts I wouldn't recognise it as the story told in this film. Brad Pitt (also producing) plays Gerry, a former UN worker who's worked in dodgy hotspots like Liberia, who becomes the reluctant saviour of humankind when the planet becomes overrun by 'Zees'. The zombies are portrayed like ants, bacteria, a Final Reckoning... This is the undead apocalypse in long-shot, which kind of muzzles their menace.Many modern movies feel overlong, but this is one that could do with fleshing out. While Gerry is gallavanting across South Korea, Israel, and, err, Wales, his family is in on a ship in the Atlantic, crying out for more character development. And for Gerry himself, it seems like every time he steps off a plane there's a chase scene waiting for him. Add to this the spoiler-tastic trailer and it all adds up to a cripplingly lack of tension.Tellingly, the best scenes in the film occur at the end, in the enclosed space of a science complex. It's here that the film takes a breath, and it most resembles the simpler, mostly superior zombie runarounds of yesteryear.Saying that, World War Z is a worthwhile addition to the genre. Purists may despair at the lack of gore and the absence of threat (Romero's original Dead series would never have indulged such an impervious and saintly hero), and readers at the departures from the novel. But mostly it should be enjoyed for what it is: a solid, workmanlike action-adventure, moderately original in its style and scope, if not its predictable plot developments.",5,3,11,24 June 2013
Zootopia," Smart and inclusive animation with a social conscience
","Yes, it's a Disney movie about talking animals. And yes, it's deservedly kicking butt at the global box office.Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a rabbit from an idyllic rural community. Her risk-evasive parents just want her to be a farmer, but Hopps has bigger ideas. She's heading to Zootropolis to chase her dream of being a cop. While on traffic duty she meets Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a sly fox skilled in the ways of the hustle. When Hopps lucks into a missing person case, she teams up with Wilde to uncover the mystery. It's bigger than they thought. Turns out predators are regressing to their aggressive primal state, frothing and speechless; and there's a cover-up which goes right to the top. Fox and bunny must work together to solve the case.The 'Zootopia' of the (better) US title refers to Hopps' belief that the city is a place of infinite diversity and complete harmony. To quote the Hail, Caesar!: Would that it were so simple. Zootropolis is a place of tensions and prejudices between its animal citizens. One of those prejudices is carried by Hopps herself: she carries fox repellent spray wherever she goes. There's the first Big Theme of the movie: entrenched assumptions about the dangerous otherness of others.The city itself is split into clear sections – desert, ice, jungle etc – like a Super Mario Bros map. It makes for a nonsensical but utterly beautiful environment. It's populated by all manner of creatures great and small. The movie directly addresses Disney's historic fascination with anthropomorphising beasts. There's even a slightly awkward visual acknowledgement of cartoon animals' lack of genitalia.For a feature cartoon we get an unusually coherent plot, channelling some enjoyable buddy cop and detective thriller tropes. And the script delivers mercifully few ironic, immersion-breaking wisecracks.Caricatures abound, of course, but Hopps and Wilde are nicely sketched characters whose backstories of being bullied mirror each other's. They also mirror the broader social issues the film addresses.This is a timely film, what with Mr Trump sowing the seeds of fear and hatred and appealing to base rage as a release valve. Zootropolis's final manifesto is unapologetically liberal: one of finding common ground as a way of accommodating diversity. We are evolved, it says, so that we might seek an alternative to resolving difference through our most basic animal instincts. Existence precedes essence, not the other way around.Hopps gets a Big Speech at the end where she spells out the themes and moral messages of the film, just in case they went over the heads of younger viewers – or possibly adults who genuinely believe what they've seen is 'just for kids'.So, while a barrel of fun and full of jokes (many of them visual, rewarding repeated viewings), this is a surprisingly thoughtful and sober film. It has its fair share of slapstick, but isn't stuffed with interminable action sequences. We definitely don't get the Marvelisation that almost spoiled Big Hero 6 in the final act. The big and clever showdown here is resolved through the use of imagination; and imagination is the key to empathy; and empathy is the key to a tolerant society. Nice writing.Inside Out was about human consciousness. Zootropolis is all about social conscience. Maybe it doesn't hit the heights of Pixar's masterpiece, but it wouldn't look out of place in the filmography of that lauded studio. Zootropolis may be a struggle for very young ones, but it is consistently entertaining and valuable viewing for smart nippers and adults alike.",7,5,17,15 March 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Superior sophomore star-hopping
","J. J. Abrams' 2009 reboot was a blast of pure photon energy, replete with wicked flirty banter between Kirk (the rubber-faced Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), and some truly memorable action set-pieces. This time around, the snappy dialogue remains, the set-pieces are less memorable, and the plotting is heavier. Overall, it avoids the tricky second album syndrome - which, as Quantum of Solace showed us, can be most pronounced after a successful reboot. The plot this time around is suitably preposterous. After a galactic terrorist named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) attacks Starfleet, Kirk and crew are tasked with assassinating him at his hideout upon the Klingon home world. They end up capturing Harrison. A series of satisfying plot twists demand that Kirk and Harrison team up, even though Kirk knows he's aiding the enemy. Broadly the storyline is a means of humbling Kirk - as Commander Pike (Bruce Greenwood) observes, what Kirk really lacks is humility. I'll go straight to the film's main flaw, as I see it. Without wishing to risk spoilers, there seemed to be a point at which the film came to a definite conclusion. We know there will be a sequel (the plan is for a trilogy), so it would have been an interesting place to leave proceedings. But returning writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, along with Damon Lindelof (Prometheus... *shivers*) apparently felt the need to wrap everything in a perfect bow again. A missed opportunity for a bold conclusion. But otherwise, the film is a riot, possessing the same screwball energy as the first film, and once again appealing to the sci-fi hardcore and the mainstream moviegoer without pandering unduly to either. As before, the scenes involving the Kirk-Spock love story are the best, their dynamic bristling with outspoken frustration and unspoken need. Simon Pegg's Scotty has a stronger role this time out, proving himself to be more than comic relief. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is more of a damp rag, but thankfully there's powerful female support in the form of newcomer Carol (the anime-pretty Alice Eve). Star Trek Into Darkness is a worthy sequel to a film that somehow made Star Trek cool again overnight. In that regard, it may lack the same impact, but it has plenty of new ideas. If it's the filling of a three- part Abrams sandwich then it's very tasty indeed.",7,4,20,9 May 2013
Green Room," Mean green Nazi machine
","Anton Yelchin plays Pat, the soft-spoken guitarist for a punk band called The Ain't Rights. They're on a half-baked tour when they get a gig in a Portland bar run by fascists. They play a confrontational set, before discovering a dead body in the green room. They're detained, along with local girl Amber (Imogen Poots). When the owner (Patrick Stewart) comes to dispense with them, the band barricade themselves in the green room. Negotiations fail, the Rottweilers come out, and so begins the worst aftershow party ever.It's a twist on the backwoods redneck schtick we've seen a million times before, though the setting is undoubtedly bold. If Blue Ruin was Jeremy Saulnier's Coen Brothers calling card, here he's gone full Assault on Precinct 13-era John Carpenter. Or you could replace neo-Nazis with zombies and you've got Night of the Living Dead. It's beautifully directed and edited, and often heart-poundingly tense. The air of sombreness; the doom-laden dark ambient score; the saturated palette – it all combines to supposedly lend the narrative some kind of weight. But this is a B-movie in art-house clothing. There is humour but it's subtle, buried under the virtually impenetrable dialogue. Saulnier is sadly unwilling to run with the high concept, resulting in some convoluted and not-very-engaging dramatics among the skinheads.Poots is miscast as Amber (she never convinces), although I quite enjoyed Yelchin's high-anxiety performance in the lead. Predictably, however, it's Stewart who steals the show. His drawling Darcy is a man of quiet menace: a far more frightening and believable fascist than we usually see on screen. The Ain't Rights are an awkward bunch. I'm guessing Saulnier's intention was to portray protagonists who are gradually drained of their humanity as the film wears on. But they're quite unlikeable in the first place, so by the time the ironic final shot comes along, the punchline doesn't land. At a push there's the hint of some underlying theme about the plight of the modern liberal left, feeling beset on all sides by right-wing reactionary madness. But the troupe isn't developed enough as a set of characters to be certain. Then there is the violence: the threat of it and the unflinching depiction of it. There's some extreme body horror bloodiness early on – limbs and throats and guts – which appears to foreshadow a truly Grand Guignol finale; but soon the guns are out and the inventiveness flags and it never arrives.Green Room is a decent enough stab at a remix on the siege sub-genre. At around 90 minutes it's lean, mean, and ruthlessly efficient. Just don't expect LOLs or depth or a whole bunch of surprises.",6,1,8,29 April 2016
The Danish Girl," Sexuality and the City
","In his 2000 book, David Ebershoff never set out to write the definitive biography of Lili Elbe (born Einar Wegener) and likewise this film doesn't parade a 'True Story' claim at the start. What we get is a fictionalised account of one of the first individuals to receive gender reassignment surgery, in 1930.The story focuses on Einar's transition and its effects on his marriage to the portrait painter Gerda Gottlieb (Alicia Vikander). The woman Einar wants to be, named Lili, is the third person in the relationship, causing complex jealousy and resentment. Surgery seems like the only option to remove the ambiguity and confusion in their relationship – although Lili also risks losing her life.It might have awards-bait written all over it but it's not the 'issue' movie the trailer would have us believe. Or, at least the issue isn't political or sociological, it's psychological and philosophical. In its strongest moments The Danish Girl –explores identity in unusual depth and with unusual conviction. Fiction, here, liberates a greater truth.Redmayne's performance occasionally strays into the realm of mannered and affected but it also shows us a complex vulnerability which confidently elicits as much frustration as sympathy. It's another physical transformation, arguably more challenging than his Stephen Hawking. Redmayne is portraying a person who's man in body and woman in spirit. In The Theory of Everything the actor's challenge was to portray disability; here, the challenge is on the audience, to empathise with someone who believes their perfectly able body is wrong.For me, Vikander is the real star here. She's strong yet heartbreaking in the impossible role of Einar's wife. What will she ultimately become when Einar is replaced by Lili? I'm not sure she even knows. As with Ex Machina, Vikander has a rare poise: an ability to command the screen with silence and stillness. It's the opposite of Redmayne's restless turn.The script mostly lands. Some lines sound like they were written to be quoted rather than to be spoken – 'You made me possible' – but these spare words do get to the heart of things. And what heart this film has. Its triumph isn't only in putting a transgender person front-and-centre without pathologising their condition; it is in allowing us to see sensitivity and gentleness in men without assuming homosexuality.Alexandre Desplat's score is a bit soppy, its rolling river piano mimicking Michael Nyman in the blandest way, but it can't spoil the craft within the frame. Director Tom Hooper throws in some familiar elements: that hyper-real theatre set aesthetic we've seen in John Adams and Les Miserables, and those extreme close-ups which would be warts-and-all were we not looking at exquisite movie stars.As Lili moves closer to her actualisation, her world is bedecked in the light and colour of Paris, before moving into nature, into truth. In the end we get an outrageous Movie Moment but against the odds it works, and you're weeping. And you reflect and realise that you've just seen a quiet landmark of a movie.",7,0,3,6 January 2016
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," You'll want to rewind two hours
","I remember playing the original Prince of Persia on the Amiga 500. It was a race against time to rescue a princess from an evil vizier. And that was it. No time-bending; no art du déplacement. Just fencing and jumping and pits of spikes.The new tie-in from increasingly hack-like director Mike Newell is based on more recent incarnations, of course. But however complex modern videogames have become, it's not that interesting to watch someone else play a computer game, and that's basically what you get here. The Sands of Time element involves a dagger with a button which rewinds time by a few seconds. You can imagine a young Spielberg revelling in a craftily-written scene in which the smouldering heroes bicker and flirt, jostling events to out-do one another, subtly subverting our expectations whilst satisfying our need to be entertained. This script (the product of four minds, including original PoP creator, Jordan Mechner) gets the bickering and flirting bit, but there's none of the craft.In fact, the script is downright lame. Lots of plot, yes, but written so thuddingly, and with so much exposition, that none of the boring characters have a chance to do any acting. Least of all Sir Ben Kingsley, who seems to be having zero fun as the sinister patriarch. There's some wit in Alfred Molina's Sheik Amar, but ultimately his presence only serves to remind us that the aforementioned Mr Spielberg made a vastly superior action adventure 28 years ago.Indeed, Raiders of the Lost Ark spawned a phenomenal franchise. Disney and Bruckheimer may hope for similar affection, or at least the dollars of the Pirates machine - but I fear they'll receive neither.",3,28,60,27 May 2010
127 Hours," Feels more like 27 minutes...
","Danny Boyle is committing GBH on the frame more than ever these days. It works in 127 Hours initially – during the opening cross country scenes, with the ironic camera swooping across the landscape not to find some undiscovered wonder, but Aron Ralston (James Franco). As Ralston approaches the gorge that will become his living tomb, the editing ratchets further, and the tension mounts. Yet it never STOPS ratcheting. Even as Ralston's poignant premonitions begin, of the son he may never have, Boyle is intent on pummelling our senses with colour and sound, never allowing us to settle into the lonely mundanity; the grey, endless dread. We're left with a breezy comic book descent into an unconvincing hell.The decision to depict Ralston as smug and vacuous is admirable, although given that he now commands an eye-watering honorarium for motivational speeches in real life, it would seem that this is a character rainbow at whose end has not been found the Church of Humility.Perhaps there is an underlying commentary on these narcissistic times here: the notion that Ralston may have taken the final, gory step towards survival out of a semi-conscious desire for celebrity. Even his heartfelt message to his folks (probably the film's best scene) is performed as a brash American talk show. Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufoy, with their premonitory promises of a selfless paternal utopia, do their best to (ostensibly) scupper this suggestion; but the smell still lingers, not least because they've, well, made a film about the guy. There's a self-fulfilling irony here that's hard to comprehend.The film serves as companion piece to Slumdog Millionaire, insofar as Boyle bleeds a heart-warming story from the bleakest of backdrops, building the narrative from grizzly horror, through drippy sentimentality, to orgasmic frenzy. The tonal shifts in 127 Hours might be slightly less jarring than the former film, but the aftertaste is no less tooth-rotting.On the occasions the editing settles we glimpse a fine performance from Franco, although less varied and witty than Ryan Reynolds' in Rodrigo Cortes's Buried. Come to think of it, Cortes's film summons more excitement, humour and pathos from the confines of a single box than 127 Hours can muster with all its gimmicks.",4,18,41,6 January 2011
Dead Poets Society," Bright stars
","In the heart of more prolific days, Peter Weir directed this bold anti-establishment gem, starring a conspicuously reined-back Robin Williams as the unorthodox English teacher John Keating - a name that sounds like a poet's, to match the man's passion for the passion of individual will. Williams would do more nuanced, angrier work in Good Will Hunting eight years later, but this was the movie that showed the world he was more than Mork.The real star of the show is Robert Sean Leonard as the tragic trickster Puck (AKA Neil Perry), whose father can't afford for him to fail, but who cannot live without his thespian dream. With a luminescence reminiscent of Jim Carrey (who would take the titular lead in possibly Weir's finest, The Truman Show), Leonard beautifully portrays the joy and agony of personal expression's vital extremes.As usual, Weir's aesthetic is classic yet distinct, never bellowing for attention but occasionally coming alive to provide an indelible image: a bicycle sending a wave of birds into the sky; a shy student spinning in a poetic trance; a tiny lost figure stumbling onto a frozen harbour.Maurice Jarre's ugly synth score is slightly jarring (no pun intended), but Weir is on hand to furnish his soundtrack with a series of well-chosen classical pieces, most memorably two Beethoven excerpts, including the possibly divine 'Emperor' second movement, which helped burn Picnic at Hanging Rock into our brains.There's little subtlety in this Society, but there is a wealth of humanity and truth, and a boundless idealism, amounting to another fine fable in the canon of a modest auteur.",7,0,0,15 May 2011
My Neighbor Totoro," A treat for all to cherish
","In 1988, after the delightful Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984) and Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), Hayao Miyazaki turned his attention to an even younger audience for this sugar-sweet fairy tale charting the adventures of the two young girls, Satsuki (Noriko Hidaka) and Mei (Chika Sakamoto), who move to the countryside with their university professor father (Shigesato Itoi) to be near the hospital where their mother (Sumi Shimamoto) recovers from a nameless illness.It is narrower of scope than the aforementioned classics - deliberately so, because this is a essentially a small-scale drama about a family coping with a terminal illness. That sounds dreadfully morose for what is a work aimed at very young children, but it's all played out very cheerfully, as we gradually enter the kids' fantastical world. In this world they meet the sleepy troll called Totoro. Their passion gives him a reason to awaken, and he becomes the totem of strength and vitality the girls need to cope with the uncertainty surrounding their mother's condition.We often speak of Pixar's and Dreamworks' canniness with the subtle grown-up substance of their animations. But Miyazaki goes beyond winks and trivial references. Perhaps it is the simplicity of his refreshingly formless narrative, but his symbolism has never been stronger than here. At one point, Mei becomes disillusioned by the fact that her acorns will not grow. Then, one night, she and Satsuki meet Totoro and perform a strange rain dance. The acorns don't just grow - an oak tree explodes from the earth, growing a hundred feet high in seconds. It's just one of many beautiful, hopeful scenes, all of which are delivered with a delirious smile.There is more than one nod to Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland: Mei enter's Totoro's realm through a mazy, rabbit hole-style tunnel, while the hilarious 'Catbus' bears the perennial grin of the Cheshire Cat. But parents should not worry about any lurid drug references - this is a film that relishes the trappings of innocence better than any other I've seen.",7,0,1,12 April 2010
Zodiac," Machinations of a Mystery
","Zodiac tells the story - and every wild goose chase in-between - of the hopeless, hapless search for a blundering killer in 1970s San Francisco. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the obsessive newspaper artist Robert Grayson, an internet geek for a pre-internet age. Once you're locked into the rhythm of Zodiac's short, dense scenes, throbbing like a steady heartbeat, you're kind of mesmerised. But ultimately it's an experience as maddening, detailed, demanding and repetitive as the obsession it depicts. 160 minutes is a long time to be locked in a labyrinth from which there may be no escape. Zodiac really is devoted to its story. However, its determination not to stray from the evidence means that the domestic and inter-cop conflicts come across as mechanised. Chloe Sevigny plays the wife to Gyllenhaal's hair-tearing sleuth - but she plays it with flat indifference, so one is never convinced that she truly wants to drag Graysmith away from his books, least of all Mr Fincher. Ruffalo delivers the film's (and his personal) best performance. As professionalism gives way to disillusionment, and then morphs into frustration and finally ambivalence, his detective inspector is the struggle at the centre of the mystery, while colleagues drop out and cartoonists plunge yet deeper. The film's aesthetic is largely handsome and static, occasionally interrupted by virtuoso aerial pans and tracks, as if Fincher wants to position the story as lost in a city of stories (a point made rather more concisely in Psycho's opening shot). A late scene in a shadowy basement stands apart from all that preceded it as an incongruous slice of horror melodrama. After a movie as cold and methodical as Zodiac, perhaps it's no surprise that director David Fincher followed it up with something as saccharine and fuzzy as Benjamin Button.",4,0,0,8 September 2010
The Terminator," Terminator: Genesis
","Every bit as relentless and single-minded as the latest Mad Max instalment – and possessing a similar number of car chases – The Terminator was the 1984 calling card of both James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sure, the latter had a couple of lousy Conan films under his belt, but here was a role that would make him a star and give cinema an antihero every bit as iconic as Hannibal or Joker.The story is fantastically simple. In the future, machines take over, exterminating humanity from the post-nuclear wasteland. The human resistance is led by a man named John Connor. The machines send a 'Terminator' unit (Arnie himself) back through time to kill John's mother, Sarah (Linda Hamilton). Meanwhile, the humans send a protector, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn). The chase begins.Imagine knowing nothing about this world. Imagine the shock of seeing Arnie laid low with a shotgun, only to rise time and time again. For the first third of the movie, beyond a title card, precious little is explained. All we're seeing is a woman stalked by two moody men. The idea for The Terminator was apparently born of a fever-dream, and with its flashback-forward structure and descending darkness it is drenched in sweaty helplessness.It's also a masterclass in efficiency and visual storytelling. When it comes to filling in the backstory (here, a future-story), Cameron expertly brings convincing emotional weight to his exposition scenes. Reese is the emotive counterpoint to the dead-cold 101: his mission is driven by love. Not some cheesy, possessive love; Reece carries with him the hope of humanity. He loves John Connor (whom, intriguingly, we never see), so how can he not hold a near-biblical reverence for the mythic mother? Before Judgment Day gave us the powerful and handsome activist, the 1984 origin shows us the gentle, pretty Sarah. (Emilia Clarke has her eyes.) Yet her ascent to soldier is entirely believable given the unbelievable events swirling around her. Sarah is no damsel in distress; she's a warrior waiting for the right distress to unleash her potential.The poodle-perms and mecha-synth music will either be seen as dating the film, or delivering pleasing period delights, depending on your viewpoint. But what will never date is the film's brutal purity. As we gaze at the poster for Genisys, with Arnie and Sarah pressed together in unity, let's not forget how scary and thrilling it was to see her terrorised... and then turn around and terminate his metal ass.",8,1,2,24 June 2015
Moana," A link between worlds
","I confess to being predisposed toward Disney's latest animated feature thanks to my adoration for The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. Like that classic video game adventure, Moana is all about the epic wonder of the rolling ocean, and the primal and mystical forces that flow between its precious islands. There are also hints of Hayao Miyazaki – especially Nausicaa and Princess Mononoke – in its strong heroine and its concerns with humanity's impact on the environment.Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) is being groomed to become chief of her Polynesian paradise of Motunui. Yet Moana is drawn to the sea and what lies beyond the horizon. In an elegant prologue, we see an infant Moana protecting a turtle as it waddles toward the ocean. Suddenly the water itself comes alive like Aladdin's carpet (this film is also directed by Ron Clements and John Musker). So we know straight away that Moana has a special understanding with the ocean, as well as an innate empathy with nature.Less so, Maui (Dwayne Johnson). He's a demigod who stole the heart of Te Fiti, the goddess who created all life. Now a corruption is creeping through the islands. Moana's dad believes that she has a duty to stay and protect her people. But Moana's grandmother feels for her wanderlust, and encourages her to follow her instinct – an instinct which tells her to set sail and find Maui, bring him to Te Fiti, and return the goddess's heart. Obviously this is the choice Moana makes, and her adventure takes her far beyond the safe coral of her homeland.Moana begins as a leader (not a princess, she insists), with her parents pulling her away from her calling. It's the classic duty versus individuality conflict, mostly rendered without black and white moralising. 'Find happiness where you are' is the repeated mantra of the islanders – but the story's ultimate message is that such domestic happiness can only be maintained by respectfully communicating with foreign lands. (If only, humanity, if only.)Technically speaking, Moana gives us a new level of detail in CG animation. Not just in the texture rendering but in the nuance of the animation itself. The living sea – snaking like the probe in James Cameron's The Abyss – is full of wordless charisma. The general art style is nicely aligned with classic Disney 2D, except the extra dimension feels necessary to embellish the breadth of the setting.The pacing is near-perfect. By now, Disney Animation Studios probably have an algorithm for the ideal narrative structure. But heck – if they do, it's working. From the myth-building first act and the character interplay of the second; from the moment of self-doubt to the final (very touching) showdown: it's pleasingly predictable and entirely satisfying. That structural predictability allows for some fantastically bizarre setpieces along the way. Personal favourites are the attack of the Kakamora, where the movie suddenly turns into Fury Road for kids; and the Realm of Monsters, which movingly updates the weird 80s fantasy environments of films like The Legend of Sirius, and then throws in a giant glam-shelled Jermaine Clement to do a David Bowie impression.The interplay between Moana and Maui, which constitutes the drama and humour of the middle section, is smartly written and full of sparks. Being a demigod, Maui is a raging narcissist, so Moana quickly realises that persuading him to do the right thing requires an appeal to his ego – an ego which bellows godliness while whispering a fundamental vulnerability. Moana herself has the goofy appeal of the modern Disney heroine. Going deeper, her internal conflict isn't original but nor does it feel forced. Johnson and newcomer Cravalho deliver excellent voice work, some of which requires belting out lung-busting songs. Moana's theme may not be Disney's catchiest number but it sure is stirring. Joining the adventurers is a doolally rooster named Heihei. He's the slapstick cartoon element, narratively pointless but occasionally amusing. Perhaps he was inserted for younger children, because the rest of the humour is more subtle. I particularly enjoyed Maui's bromance with his living tattoo, acting as a kind of pectoral-based conscience beside his heart.Moana is up there with the best of this Golden Age of American Animation, which shows no sign of dwindling. It is extraordinarily well made and efficient, big-hearted, and achingly beautiful. Familiar elements abound, but they're remixed into an original setting with a rich mythology. Combined with thoughtful characterisation and a highly laudable (and, depressingly, an endlessly relevant) message, Moana will be seen and savoured for years to come.",8,4,16,28 November 2016
The Way Back," Shrunken
","Weir makes no claims to this story – about escapees from a Siberian gulag, and their 4,000-mile trek over the Himalayas – being true as he tells it. So it's fitting that the chameleonic craftsman has created something almost entirely unambiguous: none of Master and Commander's moral tug-of-war; none of the fable-like metaphor of The Truman Show; none of the ghostly near-surrealism of Picnic at Hanging Rock.The performances are very fine across the board. Farrell (as violent gang-leader Valka) and Harris (as the grizzled American Mr Smith) stand out particularly. Like Robert Duvall or Michael Caine, Harris has developed a face marked with history, etched by happiness and hardship. Like all the players, they enjoy a solid, unfussy script, and hurl themselves into native tongue with admirable vigour.My main issue with the film is probably lying on the cutting room floor. The work of Terrence Malick, John Hillcoat, Andrew Dominik et al shows that there are fine visionary, worldly, painterly directors out there producing work that is both crowd-pleasing and patient. The quality and relevance of the scenes in The Way Back are not in question – so why do so many of them feel truncated and thus hurried? For the escape itself to burst out of nothing makes sense as this could be argued to mirror the sudden confusion of the escapees and the guards. But too many sequences thereafter feel cursory, silencing their own reverberations. Too many shots of the vastness of this chilly hemisphere are all too brief, stealing away that vital sense of dismal isolation.Perhaps this was intentional. Perhaps Weir wanted to focus on the brutal close-up, rather than the romantic long shot. But if this is at the expense of the expanse, then I feel it does a disservice to the magnificence of the 4,000-mile task, and we're left with something that feels just a bit too small.",6,5,14,30 December 2010
Barry Lyndon," They are all equal now
","William Makepeace Thackeray's most famous novel, Vanity Fair, has been adapted into several films and TV series. The Luck of Barry Lyndon, later retitled The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq., hasn't been quite so regurgitated. Originally serialised in the 1840s before becoming a single volume in 1856 (although set in the previous century) it's a rambling text, described by a disinterested narrator, full of satirical swipes at the seventeenth century romantic ideal. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation – a bit of a flop in 1975 – dials down the satire. With Dr Strangelove, Kubrick had taken a cold and sober story (Red Alert) and turned it into a nightmare satirical comedy. With Lyndon he takes a rambunctious and ironic picaresque and turns it into a witty but ultimately sorrowful journey into the black heart of a world that can't accept the orphan foreigner.We begin in Ireland, where a young Redmond Barry (a blank slate Ryan O'Neal), in trying to win the heart of his cousin, challenges the smug Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) to a duel. The event triggers Redmond's exile, and he hits the road, not so much gallivanting around Europe as finding himself stumbling in and out of army units and from one bereft wife's bed to the next. Redmond has ambitions to wealth and status. So, when he comes into contact with Lady Lyndon (an even blanker slate Marisa Berenson), he decides to settle down and take advantage of her money and make himself a gentleman. Lyndon, however, is guarded by her fiercely protective son, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali), who will defend her honour until the violent end. Barry Lyndon employs a realist aesthetic, but it's a beautified and exaggerated realism, like a photo album telling half the story – the pretty bits – as if we were observing the fantasy of an ordered universe. The style is perfect for the self-aggrandising nature of Redmond, who would rather keep himself unknowable in detail, but would gleefully embellish his grander legend. Kubrick predominantly makes use of zooms, as opposed to tracking shots, evoking a sense of flatness similar to a painting. The compositions themselves are reminiscent of 17th and 18th century pieces – at one point Lord Bullingdon effectively walks through Hogarth's 'The Morning After'. When the camera does come off the tripod – for example, during an astonishing brawl at a concert performance – the effect is brilliantly jarring. For a film that keeps its title character in frame but at arm's length for virtually its entire 180-minute running time (save for a brief interlude of contented fatherhood), Barry Lyndon is Kubrick's most moving and heartfelt film. Kubrick used cinema for awe (2001: A Space Odyssey) and anarchy (A Clockwork Orange); but he knew also that cinema is sadness: twenty-four transient events slipping away every second. The sombre rhythm of Barry Lyndon, and the lifetime it covers, is such that we are vitally aware of the passing of time. It is an exercise in anti-tension, with minimal editing and zero revelation. Michael Hordern's ironic narrator frequently informs us of important events before they occur.Kubrick was a proponent of the Soviet Montage school of editing: creating meaning through the juxtaposition of images. And yet with Barry Lyndon the meaning is created more by the events within the frame: the stillness, smallness and slowness of people in vast, beautiful, indifferent spaces. Barry Lyndon may lack the broad humour of the more accessible Dr Strangelove, but Kubrick's acknowledgement of the absurd is still present. Marriage, monogamy, material consumption, and the endless pursuit of money: the sometimes conflicted aspects of the independence-seeking society that sprung from the one we're watching on screen. It's a reflection of our world, today. Yes, Barry Lyndon is a historical film, and it's about history, but it's also about who we are now. It is a film that questions our values and our social convictions. We may laugh or cry at the picaresque rogue and the rigid class divisions he crosses. We may sneer at the loveless marriage born of loneliness at the story's centre. We may despair at the movement from the expansive freedom of the rolling landscape to the closed world of the gated estate. But we may also consider that, unlike Redmond Barry, we have the awareness and the means and the mobility to resist such a fate. Yet so often we choose not to.",9,5,7,14 August 2016
Interstellar," The White Knight Rises
","Matthew McConaughey's renaissance breaks the stratosphere with his role as would-be-world-saver Cooper, a failing farmer eking out an existence on a future Earth that's turned hostile as a result of The Blight. It's a bad one, folks – bad enough to necessitate humankind's exodus. Ex-pilot Cooper is one of those chosen to take a shuttle through a wormhole in search of a habitable planet. Trouble is, his daughter, Murphy (The Conjuring's luminous Mackenzie Foy), is desperate for her dad to stay. It's no spoiler to reveal that Cooper does not heed her protests. Theory of Relativity fans will be aware of the temporal discrepancy that means a few hours for Cooper could mean decades on Earth.The film is broadly split into three sections: rural Earth; the interstellar journey; and finally what happens next. Suffice to say, the less you know the better. Plus it's fun playing a game of spot the famous face as new characters are introduced. The first section is pure Spielberg in the way it positions an idyllic family in the midst of an existential crisis. It's the best part of the film, full of smart dialogue and affecting relationships. The problems start when Cooper and Murph find their way to the scientists, led by Michael Caine's Professor Brand, who have their sights set on deep space. It's a breeding ground for exposition, of course, and thus a breeding ground for the Nolans' worst screen writing impulses. Some explanation is necessary, one might argue, for the mission at hand. But it follows Cooper into space, resulting in the ludicrous spectacle of characters revealing stuff that would surely have been covered back at base before liftoff.What could – should – have been an adventurous middle section of the movie, wherein Cooper and crew explore lost planets with mind-boggling physical anomalies, is fatally undermined by the decision to continually cut back to events on Earth, where those left behind grow old and argumentative. Nolan has often used the technique of showing multiple dramatic threads simultaneously. At its best this is effective, but it's only as gripping as its weakest thread – and parents bickering about coughing kids just isn't that exciting. Whatever sense of deep space isolation there might have been is virtually ruined by less immediate terrestrial concerns.It's a weird decision because what happens 'out there' is more than dramatically sufficient. The places the team visit are not just dramatic and imaginative but eerily plausible. This is sci-fi of the harder variety. A pity, then, that the editing goes out of its way to kill any sense of clarity about where characters actually are in relation to each other. It's ironic, given how over-plotted and over-explained so much of the mid-section is, that Nolan chooses to render relative space itself a mystery. There are times when I assumed characters occupied the same room, only to discover through some panicked exclamation that they were in entirely separate spacecraft.While it may be difficult to abide its structure, it's easy to admire Interstellar for its humanist message, not least because this represents a change of thematic direction for its director. This is no puzzle. It's more Signs than Inception. At times this does, however, leave one with the sense that Nolan is pulling himself in two directions. His Kubrickian technical precision, all hard lines and exact framing, is at war against that soft-hearted Spielbergian glow. Like Two-Face these impulses are never really reconciled.The film that Interstellar most resembles is Robert Zemeckis's sci-fi masterpiece Contact – another work of epic sci-fi in which the galactic journey is mirrored against a journey into the heart. Love as a force beyond the reach of modern science is hardly a new concept. But Contact had a thematic ace up its sleeve in the form of Ellie Arroway's desperate 'search' for her dead father: grief incomprehensible and irreconcilable. Science and sentimentality wedded elegantly. Interstellar has a similar hook but overcomplicates matters by pushing the stakes beyond discovery, beyond the grief of loss, to the fate of the very species. Arroway said they should have sent a poet, but here we're reminded that there's no time for poetry or awe when the mission requires such haste. It's a matter of necessity, not curiosity. Humanity wasn't 'meant' to make its survival back on Earth, we're told. No one ever counters this repeated assertion by asking whether humanity was 'meant' to survive at all.One could go on and name the other intelligent sci-fi movies referenced by Interstellar, from Solaris through Silent Running to The Right Stuff, but this would be to suggest that it doesn't have an identity of its own. While the relationships between Cooper and his human crew are frankly less convincing than the one between he and the friendly robot (Bill Irwin), the relationship between Cooper and his daughter is deeply affecting. The three best scenes in the movie involve these two characters, face-to-face, each time with a different emotional dynamic, each time with equal conviction. The sadness of time passed is portrayed movingly: proof of an emotional heft I've not witnessed in Nolan's work before, save for glimpses in the relationship between young Bruce Wayne and his father in Batman Begins.With Interstellar, Nolan doesn't rewrite the rulebook on the genre but at times he does, as he did with his comic book trilogy, refine it. The visuals are sometimes stunning: a minute craft glinting in the shadow of Saturn; a thousand-foot ocean wave; a shapeless heavenly space, apparently adorned with every second of human existence. But at other times we're lumbered with chatter and narrative chaos, the script swinging from the simple and humorous to the cluttered and cumbersome in the blink of an eye, while HAL 9000 runs amok in the editing room. I'd like to call it a flawed masterpiece, but honestly it's just flawed. Likable, even lovable at times, but too frequently, frustratingly flawed.",6,2,4,10 November 2014
Pacific Rim," As personal as Pan
","Guillermo Del Toro is a filmmaker who has straddled the art-house/mainstream divide since his first feature, Cronos, in 1993. This is because he himself apparently doesn't recognise this divide, so it isn't evident in his films. In terms of scale, style, and theme, Pacific Rim might be as far from, say, The Devil's Backbone as one can get, but it's just as much the work of its author, because Del Toro is as fascinated by the Spanish Civil War as he is enthralled by the Kaiju ('strange creature') tradition of Japanese cinema. Pacific Rim is Del Toro's love letter to Godzilla and its offspring.The setting is the near future. The story concerns a Rift between worlds, through which 100-foot monsters are coming to Earth to kick-off big style. The only thing standing between the Rift and human annihilation is the Jaeger programme: humankind builds its own, metallic monsters to bodyslam the Kaiju into oblivion. They've a matter of months to 'cancel the apocalypse'. It's too barmy a premise to start asking serious questions (why not simply guard the Rift with nuclear warheads?), and this silliness is one of the film's strengths.The special effects are a spectacle to behold. The giants never have the weightless quality of earlier CG, and the sense of scale is hugely impressive. Del Toro keeps the action admirably clear, eschewing the sorts of fast cuts that would have done an injustice to the immense power of his mighty pugilists. And while it is a film about fighting at the edge of annihilation, the tone is always light, with comic relief never far away - particularly when an old friend of Del Toro's shows up in the second act.What drags the film toward mediocrity are the protagonist and the movie's sheer length. 90 minutes of melodramatic cliché would be a breeze - but we've well over two hours with Charlie Hunnam leading the way, and he's no leading man. I thought I was watching Garrett Hedlund (Tron: Legacy) at first, but then I realised this guy has even less charisma. Main-man duties should have been left to Idris Elba, as the conflicted commander and protector of the dwindling Jaeger project, whose performance - heightened but subtle - is pitched perfectly for the material.Pacific Rim was never going to be as deep as the ocean of its title, but to expect otherwise would be like complaining that there are no slow-mo shootouts in Good Night and Good Luck. It's a robot versus monster movie, from a moviemaker who loves the genre. It could have done with a shave in the editing room, and possibly some of that big budget could have gone on a star for the driving seat (even Will Smith had Bad Boys before he got the Independence Day gig). But if you're asking for a gleefully bloated, uncynical hooray for humanity, you can't ask for more.",5,4,11,15 July 2013
Rush," Vroom for improvement
","Ron Howard's handsomely-staged drama unfolds in the pit lanes, plush homes, and smoky offices of the Formula 1 world of the mid-1970s. A period biopic, it has a similar look and feel to Tom Hooper's The Damned United, and while it also shares a writer (Peter Morgan), this film isn't buoyed by the same standard of cast.The story concerns the rivalry between Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) as they work (or buy) their way up from Formula 3 and compete for the 1976 World Championship. When a film is based on real events, professional critics have a habit of giving away the entire plot, as if we should already be aware of every twist and turn. Ignorance is bliss, as far as this non-professional is concerned, so all I'll say is that there are crashes and squeals on and off the track, and the Championship goes down to the wire.Some things about Rush are very good. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography is pristinely flashy and grimy in the right measures. Hans Zimmer's score is suitably stirring - and suitably drowned out by the excellent sound design. The performances are all solid.The problems are with the script, whose dialogue can be lousy at times; really clunky and by-the-numbers. Ron Howard works with workmanlike efficiency, concentrating on moving the plot onward, but never allowing a scene to breathe, perhaps for fear our attention won't hold before the next engine roar. I would rather have seen a tighter focus on fewer characters, and got more involved in Lauda's unusual relationship with his wife (Alexandra Maria Lara, making the most of a virtually silent role). The psychology of those who dance with death for a living is referred to without being explored.So we're left with a swift, visceral, formulaic page-turner - one that's worth a watch, for non-drivers and petrolheads alike.",6,21,45,4 September 2013
Nightcrawler," Louis Darko
","Hints of Martin Scorsese's The King of Comedy are sprinkled throughout this jet-black comedy from Dan 'brother of Tony' Gilroy. But while Scorsese's film had the merciful release of Rupert Pupkin's final vindication, Nightcrawler is a film about darkness and dirt, and it rarely emerges into the light.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom, a drifter seeking a job and seeking a purpose. After happening upon a road accident, and witnessing a team of cameramen record the events in order to sell the footage to a news station, he decides to become a freelance photojournalist. Of sorts. Starting out with a camcorder and a banger of a car, he builds his reputation and his wealth through a combination of ruthlessness, sleeplessness, blackmail, and some well, 'careful' framing. Lou is hunting the ultimate tragedy, and in the end he'll get it.This is Gilroy's first directorial feature after writing gigs on the splendid The Fall and the not-so-splendid The Bourne Legacy. Nightcrawler has the marks of authorship throughout. Each frame is exactingly busy, spattered with artefacts and colour. There are, inevitably, hints of Michael Mann in this dusky depiction of L.A. – a comparison even stronger when composer James Newton Howard brings in the howling guitars.I greatly admire Gyllenhaal's understated work in Zodiac and Prisoners. His performance here is something else. No more skillful, perhaps, but more externalised. Louis is an irredeemable product of modern capitalism. Does it ring true that a technophile like he would bring along his tapes in person, rather than uploading them to the studio? I think so. Gradually we get the sense that this is lonely yet confident man who really can achieve anything if he's given time with the puppeteers, face-to-face.Riz Ahmed's role, as Louis's sidekick, is somewhat thankless, but it's another highly accomplished performance from the British actor, here adopting a note-perfect California accent. As Nina Romina, Rene Russo (Gilroy's spouse) embodies the fragile ambitions of a woman on a downward slide. Her outbursts are tinged with fear and sadness.This is a low down film in more ways than one. We're at ground level from start to finish. Even the TV studio resembles a bunker. A depiction of the city as an oubliette: somewhere from which people don't escape. Newscasters exist not to inform but to instil fear in the denizens of this segregated zoo. It's a chillingly bleak vision, chiefly because it's plausible.Nightcrawler represents bold, atmospheric filmmaking, with a script full of humour and clarity. It mines a rich vein of satire, which may not be to the taste of every viewer. A hero Lou is not. But as charismatic monsters go, he joins Dan Stevens' The Guest as one of the year's most memorable.",8,1,4,11 November 2014
Oblivion," Love in the Time of Massive Radiation
","This is sweeping, serious sci-fi, concerning the last people on a future Earth, long since scoured by nuclear conflict. The enemy was/is a race called the Scavs. Tom Cruise plays Jack, who, along with his colleague Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), stalks the wasteland, fixing drones and maintaining the rigs that promise to one day make the planet habitable once more. Above them is the Tet, a vast spacestation that promises to take the couple to Titan, where the rest of humanity awaits.Oblivion borrows from pretty much every sci-fi movie ever made, utopian and dystopian. Planet of the Apes. The Mad Max sequels. Late on, I glimpsed Independence Day, Sunshine and Battlestar Galactica in the space of ten minutes. Even Robocop is in there, with the drones barking like ED-209. A particular cynical viewer might suggest the film starts as Wall-E and turns into Moon. But it does have some of its own ideas, mostly with regard to the technology in which Jack and Victoria are immersed.Apart from the tech design, there is plenty to admire about Oblivion. Its plot might be derivative, and ultimately wraps itself in rather a neat bow, but it's well laid out, revealing the right bits at the right times. The music, by Joseph Trapanese, along with Anthony Gonzalez from the band M83, is suitably epic and stirring, cut from the same sonic cloth as Trapanese's work on Tron Legacy. The two key performances are those of Cruise (always game, always watchable) and more notably Riseborough, who's allowed to be alluring for once. Olga Kurylenko, as Julia, is somewhat blank as the third part of the love triangle.Tron Legacy was a poor movie because it had a poor script occupied by poor characters, and this is where Oblivion elevates itself above Joseph Kosinski's previous work. Here we have recognisable humans in the midst of drama. In particular, the fraught relationship between Jack and Victoria makes for some subtle, unspoken exchanges. The dinner between Jack, Victoria and Julia, is an expertly edited exercise in tension. And the scene where Victoria lures Jack into a transparent swimming pool is both seductive and sinister, like watching Michael Mann let loose on sci-fi.Oblivion was filmed using super-HD 'CineAlta' cameras, all the better to do justice to the luscious visuals. We've seen it all before but never this beautifully rendered. And behind the sheen is a human heartbeat, which shouldn't be ignored. Oblivion is a fine love letter to classic sci-fi.",7,3,6,12 April 2013
Man of Steel," Man of Not Much Appeal
","In preparation for Zack Snyder's David S. Goyer-written Superman reboot, I returned to Superman Returns from 2006. Bryan Singer's take on Superman was a 2.5-hour love letter to an unashamedly Christ-like saviour. While the one-dimensional villainy and whizz-bangery was kind of a drag, the human stuff was affectionate and soulful. It was also humorous, something that Man of Steel certainly is not. It's like producer Christopher Nolan scoured the script for jokes, surgically removing them - and all the fun - so we're left with an turgid, mechanical, over-plotted, gloomy, deafening bellow of a movie that's shorter than its predecessor but feels twice as long.The film starts with a war on Krypton, during which Kal-El is hurled in the general direction of Earth. He's raised on a farm by Ma and Pa Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), urged to keep his superpowers a secret. Little does Kal know, he's being pursued by General Zod (played unusually blankly by Michael Shannon), the super-villain who wasted his homeworld.So we have a racist fundamentalist threatening the American way of life, who when offered the chance to join civilised society and integrate refuses, choosing instead an apocalyptic cleansing, starting with New York. I mean, Metropolis. This is a new Superman for a paranoid world, cowering under the shadow of terrorist outsiders. Big themes. Unfortunately the script is a freakshow parade of glum portentous exclamations, convoluted sci-fantasy references, how-why-what exposition, and stillborn attempts at aphorism.Change is good. Comic book characters are necessarily reinvented throughout the ages to reflect the society that puts them on the page. But the changes have to work, and most of them don't in this film. It doesn't really matter that Clark Kent (played by Henry Cavill, with a perennial slight frown) has gone from awkward goof to smug beefcake, because we barely see him interacting with humans as an adult. But changes to other characters, in particular Lois Lane (a miscast and/or misused Amy Adams), serve only to further deny any semblance of humour from encroaching upon proceedings.The film isn't a complete disaster. Costner and Lane provide some softness and soul in their small roles. There's some pleasing John Carter-esque production design on Krypton. And while it might not be The Last Temptation of Christ, Goyer does at least glance in the direction of understanding the psychology of being The One.In the last reel, the final confrontation(s) outstay their welcome, but they're welcome relief from the lousy dialogue, and the mass destruction is certainly on an appropriately vast scale. (No need to hide your eyes - it's only implied that hundreds of thousands die.) It is telling that the best set-piece in the movie, which involves a tornado, occurs earlier on: well-choreographed action with an emotionally dramatic core. If only the rest of the film had worked on the same basis.",4,2,6,16 June 2013
28 Weeks Later," The guts and the ingloriousness
","Danny Boyle directed 28 Days Later, and he exec-produced this sequel as part of his burgeoning partnership with Alex Garland. Directing duties fell to Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, creator of 2001's ingenious Intacto. He stamps his authority on the picture with a startling opening sequence: a dizzying attack on a country farmhouse, which not only violently reminds us that these are far from George Romero's shambling knuckle-draggers, but also that anyone – man or woman, young or old – is fair game. It sets the tone. It sets the rules.Next we're thrown into a grimy, semi-deserted London (reminiscent of another Spanish-speaking director's apocalyptic vision, Children of Men). It's here that Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) arrive to meet their father, Don (Robert Carlyle). But something is rotten as a corpse within the family unit, and the kids take it upon themselves to sneak out of the militarised zone to put a full-stop on their unfinished childhood. What they discover unleashes hell, and it's up to the US occupying forces, led by a stolid Idris Elba, to quash the infected insurgency.The film's early sequences contain some creepy, classical horror imagery, usually concerning Catherine McCormack's stricken Alice, before the film gives way to a series of expansive, logic-be-damned action set-pieces. As a marriage of styles it's not quite as broken as Alice and Don's, but it makes the film feel lopsided.While The Walking Dead proves that the zombie holocaust genre hasn't really the flesh to fill a whole series, an extra 20 minutes wouldn't have gone amiss from 28 Weeks, just to add a little meat to the bony characters – particularly Jeremy Renner's pragmatic Doyle, who seems to be riding on a kind of Hurt Locker zephyr, but with hints of a heart. Rose Byrne, likewise, as Scarlet, can only show a glimmer of the utilitarian behind the perma-frown.There's no profundity on offer here, just basic moral dilemmas as fleeting as a moving target in a gun sight. At a push there's a veiled allegory about post-war Britain's reliance on the US; and moreover, particularly in one barmy sniper sequence, a crack at repeated 'friendly fire' debacles in the theatres of madness mired in the Middle East. But it's really about the visceral thrills. Like its predecessor, budget restraints are a blessing not a curse, forcing imaginative film-craft and rabid performances into the space that, one fears, CGI excess will occupy when the infection extends to 28 Months.",6,1,2,4 June 2011
Bridge of Spies," Every person matters
","Amidst the megahits of Q4 (is winter the new summer?) comes this quiet sleeper from Steven Spielberg. It's a chamber piece defined by soft words and silent gestures. Even the true story upon which it's based is a relatively unseen bit of history. Although it's such an interesting story, you wonder why.You've seen the big beats in the trailer. But this is a movie of details as tiny as the secret messages that unshakeable Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) receives on the sly. He's captured and fast-tracked through the American justice system. Insurance lawyer Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) represents him, but he's powerless against a guilty-by-default verdict.Then the Ruskies capture a US spy and an American student. As a US citizen ostensibly representing no one but his clients, Donovan is bunged off to a divided Berlin to negotiate a swap: one Russian for two Americans. The devil's in the detail – and, as Donovan discovers, there are so many damned details.Spielberg is cinema's top craftsman. We know this. But he does little here to draw attention to that consummate skill – and I mean that as a compliment. The 'quiet camera' of Lincoln continues. And as a story it's as much a humanitarian one as Lincoln, although the script here (sharpened up by the Coen brothers, who are presumably to thank for the plentiful ironic humour) is less labyrinthine, less grandiose. More on-the-nose.So is Thomas Newman's music, sadly, which sounds like one imagines a Spielberg movie should be scored, all sugary clarinet softness. It jars with the austere Cold War mood and only really making sense in the final scenes, where a creeping schmaltz lurks. The Lives of Others this ain't.That's not to belittle the human emotion the film possesses, which is mostly convincing. Abel's 'standing man' speech is a keeper. But beyond that, Bridge of Spies is a film of Big Themes: what nationality means; what professional duty means; and the arbitrariness of national borders. Donovan is genuinely baffled by the hypocrisy of his superiors, regarding Abel as merely a human being doing a job – the same job many US spies are asked to do.Rylance, subtle and dignified, is a shoe-in for a Supporting Actor gong. Hanks, meanwhile, makes it look effortless, somehow forging a relatable everyman out of an iron-nosed lawyer. These are actors at the top of their game.Intense, involving, and intelligent: if you're looking for something patient and quietly moving at the multiplex, look no further. It might look like minor Spielberg, but it's a major dramatic success.",7,2,5,24 November 2015
Silver Linings Playbook," O no
","Following The Fighter, David O. Russell takes another familiar story and reinvigorates it with a spirit of ensemble chaos. Scenes are stagey and dialogue crackles, and gestures flail and faces grimace, as if everyone's aware the camera is there and they all want to play to it. It's an uncanny dramatic style, one that drags you along for the ride, even when it sits incongruously with the naturalistic aesthetic.Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a bipolar sufferer snatched from the asylum by his nervous mother, and brought home to recover in a real madhouse. Pat is obsessed with the idea of rekindling his marriage, the violent break- up of which was the cause of his original breakdown. (We needn't worry about any scary unpredictable outbursts - Pat's much-referred-to anger is strictly regulated by the code of Hollywood morality and comedy.) To do so he enlists the help of Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a dirty babe who needs a partner for a Dirty Dancing competition.Silver Linings Playbook is ostensibly about mental illness, but really it's selling the age-old myth that any emotional dysfunction can be overcome with a Positive Mental Attitude. It does peddle it with vigour: there's real chemistry between Lawrence (more animated than usual) and Cooper (unsubtle but effective); the dialogue has an enjoyable runaway mine-cart quality; and the relationship between Pat Jr and Pat Snr (Robert De Niro, in his best role since Stone) is sometimes affecting.But however Russell garnishes it, this is a predictable film which betrays its interesting setup by descending into a boring fairy tale. By the time the climactic dance-off comes around, rather than rooting for the meetcute triumph, I was desperate for Russell to claw back some anger or oddness or edginess, rather than following the Nicholas Sparks routefinder to easy soft-focus satisfaction.It has the look and feel of an Oscar contender (in itself that's neither praise nor condemnation), but it's not clear for what it might win. The performances are decent, without plumbing the depths of those in The Master, while the script is zippy but thematically all over the shop. We'll just have to wait and see what's left after Lincoln sweeps the board.",5,20,38,30 November 2012
The Lego Movie," Lego crazy
","This very amusing and imaginative film from the makers of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs absolutely delighted the children in our auditorium, to the point where one kid cried out, 'This is the best film EVER!' I wouldn't go that far, but in the afterglow of Pixar's Golden Age, it's definitely one of the better ones.The plot concerns Emmet Brickowski, an everyman (voiced by Chris Pratt) – everyfigure? – thrust into the role of 'Master Builder', on a quest to vanquish the dastardly Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Business, president of Octan Corporation and the world, intends to glue everyone in their place. Emmet and his crew are out to stop him through the power of ideas – e.g. building and re-building stuff. It's a modern American story, initially about individualism and entrepreneurism, and later about cooperation; sort of an anti-superhero film, with a light subversive streak.The plot is fairly generic, but there are numerous surreal interludes throughout the film. Mostly these are enjoyable (I loved the visual allusion to 2001: A Space Odyssey), but there are certain 'fourth wall' scenes toward the end of the film that I found a bit sinister. I mean, obviously the film is an advert for Lego, but is there really a need to make the marketing so manipulative? The 'Man Upstairs' scenes unashamedly employ soft-focus sentimentality to associate the product directly with parental love. Obviously young kids aren't going to care much about the ideological use of marketing, but I think the otherwise perfectly laudable message of the film was enough without these overwrought scenes.Now, back to the good stuff.I don't know what methods were used to create the look of The Lego Movie, and now I've seen it I don't want to know. It may be all CG, but it has the look of stop-motion. It has a charming jerky grace which is unique in modern mainstream animation. The action scenes are frame-hoppingly chaotic, but I think this works nicely, capturing the way that children arrange their toys in tableaux (although they probably wouldn't use the word 'tableaux').In the main role, Pratt plays the part with dorky charm, while Ferrell channels his best Mugato as the villain. Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson are on rare loose form as Vitruvius and Bad Cop/Good Cop respectively. My personal favourite is Batman, played by Will Arnett as a bitter, self-absorbed bully.Product tie-ins could well be the shape of things to come, and if they can always be this smart and funny then I say bring them on. Manufacturers have made toys based on films for decades. This time it's simply being done the other way around – and it proves that the result needn't be Transformers.",6,0,1,24 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," A very good deal
","Dallas Buyers Club is unashamedly accessible and formula-driven, while bringing to the fore various social concerns: ideal, conscientious, mainstream filmmaking, then. On the surface it looks like a kind of Philadelphia for the 21st century. But Jean-Marc (The Young Victoria) Vallee's film isn't simply a film about discrimination; it's also about the relationship between the public and Big Pharma, the ethics of controlled drugs trials, and the cooperative human spirit.Based on a true story, the story begins in 1985. A self-destructive rodeo named Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) discovers he has HIV. Regarding it as a disease for 'fags', he dismisses (and defies) the medical establishment's 30-day prognosis. He researches drugs - and alternative drugs. Woodroof becomes a dealer in non-FDA-approved medicines, 'smuggling' vitamins and proteins from around the world. He then sells memberships on US soil, giving the pills away for free. Needless to say, a showdown with the FDA looms. Along the way, Woodroof befriends a transgender woman, Rayon (Jared Leto), and a sympathetic doctor, Eve (Jennifer Garner).The 'McConaughnaissance' will be complete with Christopher Nolan's Interstellar later this year, but this is the movie that could (and should) nab McConaughey an Oscar. It's not the best or boldest movie in his astonishing run since 2011's The Lincoln Lawyer, but his is a fierce, detailed, unsentimental performance worthy of recognition. Leto is very moving in the supporting role. Garner, sadly, has less to get her teeth into, largely reduced to a sympathetic sideliner.Despite its subject matter, the film is not unrelentingly grim, and there are frequent bursts of humour, particularly in the increasingly tender odd couple banter between Ron and Rayon. It's a story with a natural drama at its core: two extremes (the alpha-hetero and the flamboyantly camp) uniting against the weight of an aggressive, punitive institution; a story that can't fail to inspire, provoke, and outrage in equal measure.",7,1,3,26 February 2014
Control," 'Isolation'
","Like many an immortalised front-man before him, the jury may remain out on Ian Curtis's talent (he even sounds like a certain Jim Morrison when he sings), but there's no denying that he was a uniquely troubled thinker. Besides, how are we to know what musical riches he may have mined, if he'd the chance to grow into a man? Control is sad, yes. But it is also a call to compassion, informing us that there is a wealth of love in the wildest heart.Reducing the supporting cast to sketched ciphers serves to enhance the sense of Curtis's isolation. The one other character with real flesh is Debbie, his wife, skilfully played by Samantha Morton as endlessly beaming yet bereft, with an Ian-shaped hole in her soul which will never fully be filled.Real-life singer Sam Riley's performance is impressive precisely because he doesn't strive to impress; rather, he is a clenched fist of internal turmoil. We first witness his bleak romanticism as he quotes Wordsworth, gazing from a window into the middle Macclesfield distance. A few short years later Debbie is confronting him about his infidelity, and his eyes are on his feet, and he's quoting nothing, not even himself, as if the elusiveness that was once his allure has become his mind's ball-and-chain.In pristine monochrome, the film portrays the brief life of a promising urban poet, from Bowie beginnings to an Iggy Pop end, via the Sex Pistols; and so, far from the usual fill-the-blanks perfunctory closing caption, the final reminder that Curtis was only 23 when he died hits us like a punch to the heart.",7,1,1,28 October 2010
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," 'I do believe the worst is behind us.'
","The worst of Sir Peter Jackson's Tolkien series - last year's An Unexpected Journey - is now behind us, and it was still better than most blockbusters since. The Desolation of Smaug is a rung above. Show me a more heartfelt, inventive, well cast, exciting, and sumptuously detailed realisation of a fantasy world on screen and I will eat a sorcerer's sandal.Thankfully, a year on, fans are now in a position to be able to sift out of professional reviews the irrelevant criticisms. 'These films are too long!' Not long enough for those of us who want more Middle Earth. 'Shallow CG spectacle!' cry the same critics who just hurled five stars at Gravity. 'Three films means three times the money!' Yes - and it is money some of us are more than happy to pay.So here we have the continuing adventures of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and his crew, the Company of Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage, now minus his oaken shield). Part Two of Jackson's sumptuous trilogy brings greater life and depth to John Ronald Reuel Tolkien's source novel - a tome small in width but wide in vision. The best addition is Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), an overdue she-elf heroine, who feels like a full character lifted from literature.The Battle of Five Armies always felt a bit rushed on the page, so after An Unexpected Journey it was apparent that this mighty mash-up would constitute the third movie. That leaves the middle chunk: the elves, the spiders, the lake, and that dastardly dragon (Benedict Cumberbatch). But, strangely, sadly, we're left without any of those merry songs.The dwarfs aren't such a merry bunch this time around. Bilbo's final line from the last outing echoes throughout the encounters of this second instalment: chattering spiders (arachnophobics beware); a nefarious Necromancer; and a new orc-nemesis in the form of Azog's son, Bolg (Lawrence Makoare). Like The Two Towers, a shadow has descended on this story. And, like The Two Towers, a new narrative complexity is introduced: Desolation is less linear than Journey, the action leaping between story strands like elves through woodland branches.Perhaps as a result of having (original director) Guillermo Del Toro on board as a co-writer, there are some scenes of weird horror, particularly an early sequence in Mirkwood, where VFX and editing combine to bamboozle both characters and audience. It's as if the mighty Mexican has unlocked in Jackson the playful auteur - he of Braindead, Heavenly Creatures et al - who was conspicuously absent from The Lovely Bones and reined in for King Kong.Towers was my personal favourite of the Rings trilogy, so my expectations for this bridging instalment were naturally high and mostly met. While the setpieces - particularly the head-hopping barrels sequence - are some of the most thrilling in the Middle-earth series, thematically there's nothing here to rival the bereaved drama that we once watched unfold at solemn Edoras. But it's clear that this trilogy's unique selling point is its levity. Tolkien's tome was equally whimsical but never this witty. In Freeman we have an expert comic actor, naturally likable and fussily British; almost the antidote to the imperious Hollywood superhero.The flaws are few and forgivable. Lee Pace's Thranduil comes dangerously close to the wrong side of salted ham. There are some odd narrative decisions late on - the intercutting between Lake Town and the Lonely Mountain kind of removes some of the tension from the dwarfs' ruckus with Smaug. It seems churlish to expect a symphony a year, but Howard Shore's score seems to be strangely lacking in variety this time around. And perhaps Alfrid (Ryan Gage) is no more than a cartoon version of Grima Wormtongue - although he and the Master of Laketown (Stephen Fry) are a fun combination nonetheless. Also, some will probably turn their nose up at the suggested romance between Kili (Aidan Turner) and Tauriel, but I found it quite touching.All the elements of direction, performance and design combine for a joyous romp - and, better still, we've moved beyond the Shire and Rivendell to romp in luscious locations new. It's the world's most spectacular fan fiction: Jackson and co have built a giant on the shoulders of Tolkien's Hobbit. Enjoy.",7,6,12,13 December 2013
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A country for young men
","With this, No Country For Old Men, and There Will Be Blood, we've recently been given a formidable apocalyptic Western triumvirate - you wait fifteen years (Unforgiven was released in 1992) and suddenly three bleak classics come along at once! Watching Andrew 'Chopper' Dominik's second feature, you'll quickly realise it has as much to say about modern Western society as it has about its 1880s setting. Here are people - REAL people - who are so obsessed by the elusive nature of celebrity that they risk forgetting who they are. When James says to Ford, 'Can't figure it out: do you want to be like me or do you want to BE me?', it could be that he is really asking, 'Who am I?'. James has spent his life building his own myth; perhaps the reason he wishes to keep Ford so close is because no one knows more about Jesse James than his biggest fan. By the end of it all, Ford's actions serve only to enhance the celebrity of James; heck, Ford needn't have existed at all - after all, the suggestion here is that James effectively killed himself.Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' score at once twinkles like a fairy tale, but gradually descends through a kind of dark, apocalyptic malaise, and finally into tragedy, as James' steely facade is stripped away to reveal the depressive underneath. It's a new world for Pitt - a different kind of manic, miles away from his twitchy turn in Twelve Monkeys. His puppy dog eyes capture the madness and the sadness perfectly. He is upstaged, though, by Casey Affleck as the coward himself, and also by Roger Deakins' camera, which prowls the plains like a lonesome wolf.The pacing is slow. But slow never meant the same thing as boring - just ask Terrence Malick, or Stanley Kubrick, or Michael Cimino. Sometimes, they really DO make them like they used to.",9,1,2,12 April 2010
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The King Returns
","Since Sir Peter Jackson's last foray into Middle Earth, he's created the fantastic (King Kong) and the fantastically awful (The Lovely Bones), and now we're back and it's like we never left. Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf), Hugo Weaving (Elrond), Elijah Wood (Frodo), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel)... they've aged like elves - not a day. Tonally this is breezier than the Lord of the Rings (let's call it LotR) trilogy, but great care has been taken to ensure that it fits seamlessly into the same universe. The same exquisite detail in close-up; the same use of long shots to make the characters tiny in a vast world. J. R. R. Tolkien's little book concerns a little hobbit, who lives in a hole, who finds himself on a big adventure with a gang of dwarfs, overseen by the wizard Gandalf. Tolkien's dwarfs, seeking an almighty golden hoard hidden under a Lonely Mountain, are closer to Time Bandits than a heroic Fellowship, but Jackson and his co-writers (now including Guillermo del Toro) have shifted their purpose to something more laudable: the reclaiming of their homeland. In a beautifully crafted opening, after elegantly intersecting with The Fellowship of the Ring, the bumbling dwarfs are introduced to Bilbo and ourselves one by one, as unwelcome visitors to his humble home. They eat, they sing, they talk, and the scene is set. These are the characters we'll follow in almost every scene. The Hobbit is much more linear than LotR; scenes concerning Radagast the Brown (a wonderfully eccentric Sylvester McCoy, channelling the spirit of Tom Bombadil) and Azog (the orcish slayer of Thorin's father, Thrain) are brief asides rather than parallel plots.So it's all about the dwarfs, and we get to know a few of them well, particularly the bold leader, Thorin (Richard Armitage). He's as close to our Strider, except more reckless, driven by rage, and far less trusting of the titular halfling. As Bilbo Baggins, Martin Freeman is a more subtle performer than Elijah Wood. And he needs to be - a hero as reluctant as Bilbo is a tough sell, but Freeman convincingly depicts a gradual self-realisation: a drive from within, rather than a compulsion from without.Jackson proves once again that he's the master of combining CGI with human emotion (even though actual humans are conspicuously absent from the story). The scene involving the Storm Giants - living, fighting mountains - is a good example: rather than giving us an omniscient hawk's eye-view of the battle, Jackson focuses on the real drama: the dwarfs and the hobbit, clinging to the giants' knees. And then there's Gollum, arriving for a late cameo. The best chapter in the novel becomes the best scene in the film, with Bilbo and the unlikely keeper of the One Ring riddling in the dark. The special effects might not be technically groundbreaking as they once were, but their integration with real actors remains unsurpassed in cinema. A couple of issues. Not everyone will get along with the joviality and the slapstick. Once or twice I do feel that certain scenes contain a knowing look too many. (When Gandalf is telepathically communicating with Galadriel, I swear he nods at the audience.) Thankfully, it's consistent, and rarely at the expense of immersion. Also, given what we know, perhaps more could have been done to foreshadow the LotR trilogy - there's certainly room for this in the Rivendell sequence (in which a shabby Gandalf the Grey, in the presence of even greater greatness, looks humbler than we've ever seen him). It's conceivable that an extended cut will provide more references to the impending doom of Middle-Earth. Given the brevity of the book, what concerned me most was how Jackson et al could possibly expand the story into the first part of an epic trilogy. The fact that they have, without the film feeling baggy (Bag-Endy?), is, in a sense, an even mightier feat than the adaptation of the LotR novels. It doesn't have the emotional depth of LotR, nor the narrative breadth. It never did. But it has humour and action in droves, along with warmth and intimacy. And it's amazingly good fun - more Jim Henson than Game of Thrones; more Whedon than Nolan. Which is okay by me.Expect An Unexpected Journey to be condemned as boring and overlong by professional critics (the same critics who probably laud Bela Tarr). Expect it to be dismissed as frivolous and silly. But, more than anything, expect to be entertained by a delightful fantasy film.",7,2,10,14 December 2012
Non-Stop," Non-sense
","Much of the tension in Non-Stop trades off the likability of its star, Liam Neeson. It's a conceit frequently used by Alfred Hitchcock, from Henry Fonda to Anthony Perkins. Jaume Collet-Serra's film doesn't mine the dark psychological depths of Hitch's best output, but it's a lean and sometimes amusingly mean thriller.What starts as a high concept mid-90s straight-to-video plot – a passenger will be bumped off every 20 minutes unless Air Marshall Bill Marks (Neeson) arranges for $150m to be transferred to the perp's account – soon becomes a nail-biting, disbelief-suspending whodunit (or who's-doing-it). The film is elevated above the ordinary by Neeson's depiction of the boozy, grief-stricken Marks: there are moments when we truly share the passengers' distrust of the man apparently going mad in their midst.Marks communicates with the hijacker via text message. Here, Collet-Serra comes up with a nifty way of presenting these conversations through graphics overlaid on the screen, negating the usual tension-killing cut to a tiny cellphone screen. Incidentally, the bad guy/gal must win the award for fastest thumbs in the English-speaking world.Superior character actors like Linus Roache and Scoot McNairy provide decent support, although recent Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o is wasted as a gasping air stewardess. And is there any reason for Julianne Moore to be in this movie? Well, there's always a reason for Julianne Moore to be on the screen. But her character isn't really any more than an extra suspect and an excuse for some agonisingly cheesy and unconvincing flirtation. I guess one could argue she adds 'heart' to the movie – except this is a movie which is most fun when it's at its most heartless.The dialogue is lousy; the look is advert glossy; the CGI is poor; the performances are hugely variable; the action is brief and messy; the plot is preposterous (especially the final third). All in all, like Collet-Serra's and Neeson's previous outing, the Frantic-esque Unknown, this is an efficient and enjoyable thriller which will never be lauded as a classic, and never really attempts to make any sense, but further cements its star as the go-to guy for solid, ruffled, old school rough 'n' tumble.",6,65,124,10 March 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Welcome to the Hotel Zubrowka
","I'm one of about three people in the world who reckon The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is Wes Anderson's best film, although 2012's Moonrise Kingdom was a return to form after the slightly drab Darjeeling Limited and the mixed bag that was Fantastic Mr Fox.All of Anderson's films are mixed bags of confectionery. As he moves further from the relatively terrestrial charms of Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, the results are becoming more alien, and arguably less relatable. The Grand Budapest Hotel is beautiful, charming, and meticulous, but as icily cold as an Eastern European winter. The best Anderson films have a central relationship that provides a warm heart amidst the whimsy. Moonrise had first love. Aquatic had father and son. Budapest has hotelier and protégé, but I never got a sense of intimacy between them, only ego and awe respectively.The hotelier is Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) and the protégé is Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori). When Gustave's dear friend and lover Madame D (Tilda Swinton) drops dead, distant relatives and vague friends convene (the first of many cameo-tastic scenes), hoping to get a chunk of the deceased's wealth. Gustave is bequeathed a hugely valuable painting, much to the chagrin of the gathered mourners - particularly Madame D's son, Dmitri Desgoffe-und-Taxis (Adrien Brody), who begins a campaign to imprison and ultimately destroy Gustave, triggering all manner of breakouts, shootouts, and bumbling chases.If you've seen the trailer you'll be aware of the presence of the usual Anderson troupe, although it almost seems like overkill this time around, with famous faces merely popping up for the sake of a chuckle of recognition.The action (and ample talking) takes place largely outside the hotel, in cells and trains and leering post-Soviet streets. As a summoning of a time and place, it's Anderson's greatest achievement yet. The use of miniatures is very effective, reminiscent of the model work in Herbert Ponting's 1924 documentary The Great White Silence. There are also references to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, not just in Anderson's camera arranging characters in medium shot, and sliding through bold-coloured corridors along geometrically precise lines, but also in the theme of the passing of time: the way generations feed into each other through stories of intrigue and murder passed down.This is a melancholy film, made darker by its greedy scheming characters, and as such it feels unusually at odds with its own madcap, absurdist style. Unfortunately (and surprisingly), f-bombs constitute much of the humour; hearing Fiennes curse coarsely is funny the first couple of times, but it becomes tiresome. The scenes between The Author (Jude Law) and older Zero (F. Murray Abraham) work best, showing us the more settled, subtle, sombre film that might have been, and possibly the future of this uniquely talented auteur - but they are also indicative of the film's lack of tonal coherency.",6,11,21,13 March 2014
Gone Girl," The Game of 21st century marriage
","Sometimes it feels good to be manipulated. Gone Girl, adapted by Gillian Flynn from her bestselling 2012 novel, delights in yanking our sympathies back and forth right through its 149-minute running time. It's all about Nick (Ben Affleck) and 'Amazing' Amy (Rosamund Pike), an apparently perfect marriage of creative people. One day Nick comes home to find signs of a struggle and Amy gone. He calls the police. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) kicks off an investigation that will start with a missing person, before transforming into a kidnapping and murder enquiry.But who's murdering who? And where's the pesky body? The story of how we got to this mysterious place is told by Amy via her diary entries, and by Nick living in the aftermath. One is an unreliable narrator; the other an unreliable suspect. It's the basis for a cruel, classy morality play, with hints of Polanski nastiness and De Palma salaciousness.The film earns its generous duration by covering a lot of genre ground. We have the domestic drama between Nick and Amy in the form of flashbacks to their crumbling marriage; police procedural; media satire; courtroom conversational; black comedy; and even horror. Fincher mostly gets the balance right. Tyler Perry's hotshot lawyer comes close to cracking a smile and breaking the mask, though I get the feeling that with further viewings the whole film may emerge as some sort of strange, dark comedy. As the satire broadens – Neil Patrick Harris is introduced as a scarily controlling obsessive who could have come from the pen of Stephen King – the humour loses some of its subtlety. But that's no different to the way The Shining winked at the start and then went postal in the final act.The script is full of wicked wit, and is deliciously precise. The level of detail is matched in the cinematography and the meticulous performances. Director David Fincher is on low-key, efficient form – certainly none of Panic Room's virtuoso swooping, despite a late shift into domestic schlock. The look recalls The Game's uncanny pristine sheen, as does the playful nature of the narrative. Outside the Fincher-sphere, tonally it reminded me of Steven Soderbergh's Side Effects, another melodrama whose increasing silliness is directly relative to its tightening grip.Affleck is impressive in the main male role. It's a perfect piece of casting, trading on the actor's easy access to smarm as a means of casting constant questions as to his guilt. But the movie belongs to Pike. As if throwing off the shackles of being miscast in so many movies (Jack Reacher, anyone?), she revels in the role of a girl who was a celebrity in childhood and becomes a china doll in adulthood. We get to see what lies beneath, and it isn't nearly as pretty as the façade. It's the sort of Oscar-worthy performance that'll never get the Oscar.It might not have the mythic depth of Zodiac or the brain-scarring boldness of Seven, but in a sense this is Fincher's scariest film, set as it is now, here (kinda), in the ostensible safety of lovely homes. Given its page-turner appearance, some may argue that the film is 15 minutes too long. I'd say that's simply a matter of time management. Gone Girl is a mainstream movie with genuine thematic depth, exploring the gulf between marriage and love; the way that different crimes are treated by the image-obsessed media; feminism in the 21st century; and the nature of guilt. Few multiplex blockbusters would ask: What is murder? It climaxes with satisfying ambiguity, with an ending that will divide and inspire debate, while we recover from witnessing the birth of a very modern monster.",7,1,10,13 November 2014
Django Unchained," Angry, indulgent, amusing, disappointing
","Quentin Tarantino's eighth feature is a meandering rescue and revenge tale set in an overtly racist pre-Civil War Deep South. It concerns the slave Django (Jamie Foxx) and his bounty hunter emancipator King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), building up wealth by whacking lawbreakers, before setting their sights on plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), who's keeping Django's wife (Kerry Washington) as a 'comfort girl'.There is a fantastic performance from Waltz, who starts off playing the flip-side of his verbose Nazi Hans Landa, but then actually develops emotionally throughout the narrative - a rare arc for a Tarantino film. Foxx looks the part, although he's too soft-spoken. The words are written like they should be fired off like a six-shooter, but he sings them soulfully. Samuel L. Jackson, all bent limbs and glaring eyes, transforms remarkably into the sycophantic Stephen, the crow on Candie's shoulder; which brings us to the real revelation, DiCaprio, playing against type as the caricatured boy-emperor, ignorant and excitable, vicious as a child pulling the legs off insects.Once Django and Schultz arrive at Candieland the film moves from Jeremiah Johnson-style landscape wandering to an enclosed, nightmarish theatre piece. The effect is quite disconcerting. (It's just a pity that the film then emerges from the Big House, escapes, returning for another ending.) As usual, Tarantino's dialogue, when it works, is lyrical and amusingly precise.The film's problems are a matter of discipline. There is an unusually high quota of dud moments, like when a mob of white supremacists argue endlessly about the eye-holes in their hoods. It's a one-line joke stretched to five minutes of screen-time. Later, a climactic shootout turns out to be a pre-pre-climactic shootout, bridged with a horrifying cameo by the auteur himself, bizarrely adopting an Australian accent, sounding like Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Indulgence can be a part of the pleasure of Tarantino's films, but sometimes it is to their detriment.With its movie theatre setting, Inglourious Basterds was a film about film; about the depiction of good and evil on screen, and our relationship with heroes and villains (the cruellest character in that film was also the most seductive). Seeing the eyes of Eli Roth glowing red with the blood of his foe was troubling, because it made us question the pleasure we derive from watching evil punished. Django is more simplistic, building a cast of ogres mostly too dumb to rationalise their bigotry, unquestionably deserving of being chopped down. We desire a release. We are given it. The effect is briefly thrilling, but it's also a bit banal.",6,1,4,21 January 2013
Drive," Drive on
","Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn's Bronson was an attempt to do something strange which came across as depressingly ordinary, whereas his latest – starring a stolid Ryan Gosling as the nameless 'Driver', and Carey Mulligan as his angelic neighbour, Irene – seems to be something very ordinary made quite strange, mostly through the use of slo-mo in the emotional bits as much as the action.There isn't all that much action. Certainly very few car chases. When it hits, the violence hits hard, but it's all mired in long stretches punctuated by wordless glances, pregnant with nothing but beauty and elegant framing. It's like some crawling period drama for angrily repressive mechanics. Thankfully it is accompanied by Cliff Martinez's delicious ambient score, so you could just close your eyes.The plot is first-rate 'meh': a one-last-job affair with sexless damsel-in-distress underclothes. The Driver gives his clients a strict five-minute window (the reason for which, even after he's explained it twice, is never entirely clear), before he bails out – but five minutes is all he needs. He doesn't carry a gun; he'd prefer to force-feed his enemies bullets.We know that Driver is our hero because he's the only man who doesn't shout all the time. Bernie (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman) are particularly perturbed. Their over-the-counter barneys are strongly reminiscent of those Grand Theft Auto cut scenes we tend to skip. In fact, the whole italicised neon credits thing and the 80s-esque synth score is pure Vice City, except without the fun.At least Mad Max had a reason to be mad. From where does Driver's psychotic streak stem? Valhalla Rising suggested that Refn positions man's capacity for violence somewhere deep in his soul, so I guess a backstory isn't necessary. Bryan Cranston puts on a good show as the half-crippled Shannon, who might as well have an enormous glowing target on his forehead.Comparisons with Michael Mann are inevitable, particularly the neo-noir nightmarescape of Manhunter, and the homoeroticism of Heat. Difference is, in both cases Mann was shooting a screenplay of quality and distinction. Drive, by comparison, is about as distinct as a cigarette flicked from a passing car.",3,25,50,24 September 2011
Hellboy," Big Ron loses his head and sheds the red
","Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's third English language feature is an enjoyable comic book superhero romp starring the peerless Ron Perlman (as Hellboy himself). Big Red Ron wisecracks and chews cigars as he battles beautifully-realised CG hell-hounds in just the sort of impressive baroque sets we have come to expect from him; it seems del Toro can't get enough of letting the red stuff run through sewers and caverns - the danker the better.While the script is occasionally aimless, it's also very witty. Perlman plays Hellboy like an indignant teenager, full of tantrums and sarcastic retorts. He's ably supported by John Hurt, Rupert Evans, and Jeffrey Tambor, all hamming it up deliciously; Selma Blair seems somewhat vacant by comparison. The plot is ludicrous of course, but never boring. Del Toro is as bold as ever - not only in the casting of a decidedly non-stellar cult hero in the title role, but also in his wanton references to real historic villains to bolster the menace of his many menaces. But it is generally breezy stuff: silly, too violent for younger children, and yet sweet-natured and - Superman Returns and Spiderman 3 take note - FUN.",7,0,0,12 April 2010
Good Will Hunting," Better than Good
","According to legendary film-writer William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Princess Bride), it was he who changed Affleck and Damon's treatment from something altogether more conventional into the Oscar-winning screenplay filmed by Gus Van Sant. Whoever is responsible, we should simply be glad the film was made, as it's a very well realised, emotionally satisfying, mostly original drama; from the moving performances, especially from Robin Williams and Minnie Driver, to Van Sant's camera, forever searching for the soul of the scene, this is clearly confident, intelligent film-making.For all its truths, the film is fantastical: under Danny Elfman's twinkling, otherworldly score, there isn't a single shot of Will (Damon) actually reading one of the books he knows by heart. Indeed, we're never quite clear where Will finds the time to feed his dizzying intellect between working, fighting and drinking. Less forgivable is that Driver's Skylar is rather unfairly banished from the third act, reducing a bright character to a dull device to provide a neat ending.For my money, in terms of Van Sant's 'crowd-pleasing' output, Good Will Hunting doesn't quite scale the heights of the more acerbic To Die For, or the more politically substantial Milk. But thought-provoking and very nicely played nonetheless.",7,2,6,12 April 2010
Room," Reach for the sky
","Adapted by Emma Donoghue from her own novel, this Fritzl-esque tale of brutal long-term abuse may come across as the easier, Hollywoodised alternative to Markus Schleinzer's Michael, but that description misses the point. Room goes beyond the horror of physical incarceration and explores arguably the more challenging issue of the psychological incarceration that follows. It's easy for cinema to show suffering; harder to portray recovery, especially the stuttering kind.Joy (Brie Larson) and her 5-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) are imprisoned in a tiny room by an abuser known only as 'Old Nick' (Sean Bridgers). Jack hides in the closet when Old Nick visits Joy every night. During the day, Joy teaches Jack about the world outside Room (note the lack of definite article). There's wonderful humour and pathos in her struggles to explain reality and fantasy via images on a fuzzy old CRT TV. But for all her efforts, Joy comes to the conclusion that she must help Jack escape and see the world for himself.I'll plant a minor spoiler alert here.We have a movie of two halves. The first half takes place entirely in Room. The second follows the escape of Joy and Jack, and their efforts to recover in the brightness and busyness of the wider world. There's no trial for Old Nick. This is not a movie about the all-healing power of justice. It's about a mother and son adjusting to long-term trauma, and how it affects their relationships with the (grand)parents who've been living in their own dreadful dark for the past seven years.It may be surprising to hear that this comes from Lenny Abrahamson, who last brought us the relatively slight and irreverent Frank. While that movie was distinguished by its irony, the earnestness in Room is almost suffocating. It's not always subtle, proudly wearing its intention to devastate, making it not so much a weepie as a complete and utter bawlie, expertly tailored to tug the heartstrings. In some scenes this can be a curse but overall it's a blessing. It's no small feat to reduce an entire auditorium to a blubbering mess.As Joy's mother, shattered by her relief, Joan Allen almost steals the show with an amazingly detailed performance. In the middle is Larson, playing Joy as powerful and principled, carrying her hidden brokenness out into the real world. But the movie belongs to Tremblay. Abrahamson has drawn an astonishing performance from the youngster. For a start, the kid really acts like a kid – it's not one of those creepily precocious manchild performances that American cinema sometimes conjures. Through Jack there's a sense of genuine wonder at the world, whether it's within the confines of a sound-proofed shed, or outside where the sky goes on forever. The youngest Best Actor in Oscar history up to this point was almost 30. Just saying.I can't say I was on board with every filmmaking decision. Stephen Rennicks' soaring, Johann Johannson-style music is frequently grating, seeming to exist to make us the audience feel all fuzzy rather than having any real relationship with the narrative. And there are certain scenes which don't quite ring true. For example, the primetime TV interview – an exercise in awkwardness – is unconvincingly thoughtless. I mean, as if we need any more help sympathising with Joy. Perhaps US TV journalism really is that insensitive, but it felt like low-hanging fruit to me.There are no answers to the evil of Old Nick, nor for the suffering of those he's abused. But uncertainty and doubt are not the same as hopelessness. I felt manipulated – but that's what good movies do. In its soul-scouring search for truth, inevitably the film dips into sentimentality. But let's applaud Room for bringing to a broad audience an extremely difficult subject and making it as accessible as it can possibly be.",8,2,7,13 January 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The centre of Middle Earth
","Chris Cooper's performance in 2002's Adaptation was skillful and memorable, but the Academy Award for Actor In A Supporting Role should surely have gone to Andy Serkis for his performance as Gollum in the second part of Peter Jackson's seminal movie trilogy. The Two Towers (correctly) received the Visual Effects gong, but the Academy may have missed a trick - we couldn't have felt pity for poor Smeagol without the Englishman's dazzling talent.The Two Towers is the heart of the story in Jackson's (and Fran Walsh's, Philippa Boyens', and Steven Sinclair's) take on the tale. The book has been seriously and necessarily rejigged to suit the demands of the classical narrative. The battle of Helm's Deep, for instance, has been promoted beyond what was essentially a precursor to the final battle to something more immense: a grand, emotionally-driven climactic battle which represents arguably the best single action encounter of the trilogy.But this last stand would be nothing were it not for the quality of the drama that precedes it. The Fellowship of the Ring set the scene; The Return of the King tore the scene to shreds on an awe-inspiring scale. The Two Towers, meanwhile, sows the seeds that will bloom into the enthralling narrative conflicts concluded in its sequel, as well as containing numerous character arcs of its own. The reluctant feud begins between Boromir (Sean Bean) and Faramir (David Wenham) for the love of their father, Denethor (John Noble); the adversity between nature and industry, represented by the mighty Ents and the tyrant Saruman (Christopher Lee), comes full circle; Grima Wormtongue's (a particularly superb Brad Dourif) fleeting power over the troubled king Theoden (Bernard Hill) and his adopted son, Eomer (Karl Urban) is a wicked war waged by an opportunist weakling. And I haven't even mentioned the surviving members of the Fellowship...Pleasingly, Jackson et al continue their exploration of Arwen (Liv Tyler), as well as introducing another prominent female character. Miranda Otto's Eowyn is spiky and obstinate, and yet hauntingly bereft; a pale ghost wandering the prison of her uncle (Theoden). She's the most interesting female character in the series by far, deservingly foregrounded for the latter two movies.Epic, exciting, heartfelt, and frightening - this is a brilliant hub for the trilogy.",8,0,2,12 April 2010
Kick-Ass," Terrorism for the eyes
","Based on British writer Mark Millar's comic book series, this is an ultraviolent satire from the writer/director team behind 2007's Stardust. Like that film, Kick-Ass tweaks the nipples of genre convention to create something bold, distinctive and memorable. Unlike that film, Kick-Ass's central love story is between a father and daughter, the former educating the latter by shooting her in the chest with a handgun from ten yards. The plot concerns a normal kid, Dave Lizewski (Nowhere Boy's Aaron Johnson) – not an uber-geek or a ruffian – who dreams of being a superhero. When a mugging leaves his nerve-endings ruined, he unwittingly finds himself allied with the twisted dream team of Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) as they seek to take down the vicious crime-lord, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). Impalements, over-sized microwaves and dual-handgun ballet ensue.If film-making is a process of small judgements adding up to a single whole then Goldman and Vaughan get most the decisions right. The pacing is superb, with the snappy, fabulously foul-mouthed script bridging a series of thrillingly inventive set-pieces, chief among which are Hit Girl's introduction as she splatters the walls of a drug den to The Banana Splits theme song (a possible reference to the grandfather of the modern superhero movie, Richard Donner), as well as a first-person perspective rescue mission played out to a re-working of John Murphy's 'Kaneda's Death' theme from Danny Boyle's Sunshine.There are a couple of cons. D'Amico is a familiar mob boss with familiar patriarchal issues; he could have used a perversion or two aside from bloodlust. And Big Daddy's old police buddy (Omari Hardwick) is unfortunately sidelined, destined to remain perennial backup, as if too damn honest to spoil the party. And what about Xander Berkeley's sporadically glimpsed Gigante? Perhaps the sequel ('Balls to the Wall') will share the love more evenly. Unlike the bloodless, toothless, sexless Scott Pilgrim Versus the World, Kick-Ass spits vile anarchy from every orifice. Both films are wish- fulfilment fantasies for grown-up geeks, but while Scott Pilgrim reduces the sub-genre to 8-bit whimsy, Kick-Ass enhances it to glorious, eye- gouging HD.",7,1,3,7 September 2010
Mulholland Drive," Dreamboat
","Star ratings are irrelevant at the best of times, never more so than with a film that can only really be enjoyed by subscribing to its writer-director's modus operandi. After that it's a process of unravelling. On a surface level Mulholland Drive, looking like a Sunset Strip murder melodrama, seems shallow and schlocky. Which is, of course, half the point.A film set in an ostentatious city of extremes, the action shifts from mystery, through horror and farce, to tragedy with unshowy elegance. Lynch's techniques might be bamboozling, but this can be seen as a simple, sad tale of a starstruck loner, Diane (Naomi Watts), spurned by love, and now in love with an impossible dream. What emerges from Lynch's seductive, oneiric aesthetic is a powerful, angry attack on the poisonous hierarchy of celebrity. This is about the obliteration of the individual; the destruction of one woman's sense of self.Diane, as her imagined alter-ego Betty, conjures a dreamworld in which she arrives, starry-eyed, in the City of Angels, and finds a fallen angel: 'Rita' (Laura Harring), a beauty in the classic Hayworth mould, who has lost her memory after a car accident. In her fantasy, Diane/Betty not only lives a life of intrigue and wealth, but also retains her integrity - both in terms of her acting ability and in the grace she shows toward her secret roommate. In her fantasy, Betty is as strong as the jealousy that sucks the life from Diane. Those she hates - specifically, Rita's director and lover, Adam (Justin Theroux) - are condemned to squalor and emasculation. Betty satisfies Rita sexually. Betty makes Rita whole, and Betty is loved for it.There's dread in droves. A blind woman comes to the door, but she cannot wake Betty. There is a 'monster' lurking behind Winkie's Diner, which could be the embodiment of Betty's fear. Fairy tale motifs abound: keys to open curiosities, and dangerous red in abundance. But poor Betty is blinded by the stars.Lynch dallies once more with the Moebius strip narrative. Is this what hell looks like - to relive our life on the fragments of memory, shattered like a skull by a self-inflicted bullet? Or is Lynch simply shuffling the narrative pack, portraying these dreadful events as an abstract artist envisions the horror of death, in a way that movies will never quite manage? As the camera explores the catacombs behind the façade of the boulevard like a prowling creature, Lynch's sense of space and light has never been better. We are guests in the grey area between waking and sleep, only to find it's been painted all gaudy. Scenes - such as when Adam is summoned to a ranch to take counsel with a sage cowboy - are seemingly conjured by Betty in the way one recalls a conversation in a dream: rationalised, making purposeful the philosophical, retrospectively plotting a narrative, writing our own film. Perhaps that's the delight of Mulholland Drive: in filling the gaps, we are allowed to make the film our own.",8,5,10,25 January 2011
Dumb and Dumber," So funny it should carry a laxative warning
","If humour is simply a way of coping with the overriding misery of existence then Dumb & Dumber emerges like a cure for cancer. Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) are the knuckle-headed losers road-trippin' their way to the sunny climes of Aspen to deliver a lost briefcase to the mysterious Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly). (Lloyd fell in love with her, you see, while he drove her to the airport.) Along the way they steal from a blind kid, poison a hit-man, and give a motorbike cop a swig of moonshine he'll never forget... And that's before they've even reached Colorado.Writers and directors the Farrelly Brothers forego the cutesy angst that blunted There's Something About Mary and go flat-out on the sick and the scatological. It's puerile, of course, but Carrey's clown has never had a better home, and Jeff Daniels shows expert comic timing to add to his impressive dramatic range. The script they share is sharp as a shiv, as well as being endlessly quotable. Does the gag count sink ever so slightly in the final reel? Perhaps. But just wait for the epilogue: probably the funniest comedy pay-off since Some Like It Hot.",8,1,3,12 April 2010
Jurassic World," We're gonna need a bigger park
","Jurassic Park is now 22 years old yet still holds up thanks to well-rounded characters, an explorative script, expert direction, and a less-is-more attitude to CGI. The two sequels offered dismally diminishing returns, culminating in the shark-jumping raptor-chat of part III; so the sight of Starlord hunting with a pack of pet dinosaurs in the trailers for Jurassic World did not bode well. What did bode well was something that's been surprisingly overlooked in the series up to this point: The presence of an actual, functioning dinosaur theme park. This instalment returns us to Isla Nublar for the first time since Steven Spielberg's groundbreaking first film. Indeed, Jurassic World unashamedly uses the original movie as its template and sole predecessor. A wise move... on paper, at least. This time our Alan and Ellie are Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard; the kids are Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson); the Hammond role goes to Irrfan Khan as rich boy Masrani; and the new Nedry is Vic (Vincent D'Onofrio). The Jurassic Park incident has been buried, and Jurassic World has been operating without incident for years. But the visitors are bored and want bigger, louder, toothier. So Henry Wu (B D Wong, the only surviving cast member from the first film) creates Indominus rex, a genetically-spliced monster which basically amounts to a T-rex with less dinky arms. Suffice to say, a breakout is imminent. The kids get lost in the wild and Owen and Claire head out to save them. Meanwhile, Vic senses an opportunity to do the Weyland-Yutani thing and seize the dinosaurs for use as weapons. Good luck with that. Obviously Indominus rex embodies the idea that the entertainment industry constantly needs bigger 'n' louder products to keep the dollar signs rolling. It's a flash of satire but really it amounts to a, like, totally awesome new monster smashing stuff up. Relentlessly. Boringly. Jurassic World ruthlessly indulges what it seeks to satirise. It criticises corporate logic yet is just as disingenuous and bloated as any other Marvel-ised multiplex factory product. It smashes up its gift shops but has the depth of a plastic toy. It would leave a bad taste if it weren't so tasteless. Director Colin Tevorrow's previous credit was Safety Not Guaranteed, and Jurassic World serves as a lesson in why you don't hand the reins of a big budget behemoth to an indie guy. The direction is static and lifeless. The action is adequate but rendered tame by a staggering absence of tension-building. Visceral setpieces are connected with floss. The dialogue is as thudding and clunky as a brachiosaurus with a club foot. It took four people to write this trash – I wonder if the legal wrangling over the screenplay credits was to take their names off the poster. The characters are dull cardboard cut-outs. Pratt is stolidly sincere as the ex-Navy jock who starts and ends as a badass. Dallas Howard channels Lindsey Brigman from The Abyss as tight-ass Claire – but even Lindsey got to loosen up and take her heels off in the end. The kids... who knows? I guess they're meant to represent the indifference of youth, which as an audience experience translates as indifference as to whether they live or die. Then there's Masrani, who starts by criticising Claire for chasing the dollar and moments later gives the non-lethal order because the rampant dinosaur cost him X million bucks. Bad, bad writing. It's not just the words that sound lame. Michael Giacchino is occasionally hailed as the new John Williams, yet the only notes of distinction in his score are those of Williams himself. There's a great moment early on when young Gray swings back the balcony doors and we see the park and that music soars... But it's a false dawn, as we're subsequently lumped with scene after lumbering scene scored with indistinct music which sounds like it was 65 minutes in the making. Whether we can and whether we should were the Big Questions posed by author Michael Crichton. The reason the original story was so potent is because it took a distant scientific possibility and brought it intriguingly into a plausible reality. That's science fiction, folks, and that's why a single shot of a lagoon could produce such wonder and awe. But tantalising possibility is not drama enough anymore, it seems. Today we are at a point where anything is possible with CGI so the tendency is to throw everything at the screen. And in this new World, by the final reel, with its risible monster mash showdown, you realise everything has been thrown and nothing has stuck. As a work of storytelling it's as vaporous as dino-breath on a window. As a JP sequel it's just as bad as the others. Maybe it's time to close the doors on Hammond's glorious vision. It just isn't working out.",3,176,353,11 June 2015
Prisoners," Imprisoned by hope
","You know from the first Roger Deakins-framed shot of this child abduction drama that you're watching quality. The craft is exquisite – and the thematic and emotional content is equal to it. This is a sophisticated film that consumes material outside the staple multiplex diet: frustration, ambivalence, forgiveness, grief, rage. Prisoners has its contrivances, and a few dubious character actions, but always at the service of telling a gripping story, and asking some challenging questions.The film opens with the Dover clan, headed by Keller (Hugh Jackman), visiting the Birch family for Thanksgiving dinner. Contentment and complacency abounds. The two youngest kids go outside and don't come back. The dawning horror of the parents, and the rapid escalation in panic, is horribly and heartbreakingly played out. Keller is convinced that the child-minded neighbour Alex (Paul Dano) is the culprit. So when lonesome Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal, practically reprising his role from Zodiac, except now with new End of Watch tattoos) can find no evidence, Keller takes matters – and Alex – into his own bloody hands.The rain. It hasn't poured so much in a detective thriller since Se7en – and the mood is similarly doom-drenched. There are elements of Silence of the Lambs as well, although Prisoners is a film of subtler autumn shades. It's not as stark and austere as Markus Schleinzer's Michael, but it strikes the same eerie mood, and likewise moves at a pleasingly slow pace.The performances are excellent. Gyllenhaal's wide eyes seem here to have had their naivety washed out by horror; Loki blinks hard like he's photographing all he sees. As for Keller, we first see him stalking prey. He's a predatory animal, an aggressive protector, and grief will translate into ferociousness. Jackman, a most likable screen presence, must work extra hard to fight off our sympathy. Then there are the wives. Maria Bello's Grace appears passive, but this is simply a reflection of her pragmatic husband's inability to connect with her emotionally. Nancy Birch (Viola Davis, typically intense) stays at her husband's side, gradually becoming dominant, fuelled by the agony of loss and the even worse agony of hope.There are some truly memorable moments in Prisoners. The scene in which Loki discovers child-sized boxes in the house of a suspect is pure Hitchcock brilliance. Later, his bloody-eyed race through busy traffic is probably the most thrilling car chase of the year – the stakes could not be higher. And the scene involving Keller, a bathroom, and a claw hammer is harrowing on multiple levels: the drama is in the intention.Prisoners is distressing without being repulsive; moving without being sentimental; thrilling without being exploitative. This is the standard to which all mainstream drama should aspire.",8,1,1,14 October 2013
Silence," A tremendous gift for a new year
","Having been in some kind of development for the past quarter of a century, Martin Scorsese's Silence finally opens. And after a grim 2016 it emerges as the perfect gift for the new year: a deeply probing and contemplative epic exploring themes of persecution, integrity, truth and faith, which seems not only apt for our times, but necessary. We open with the chaotic sounds of nature – a cacophony of insect chatter and animal wailing – and then we cut to 'Silence'. The year is 1633 and the place is Japan. Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) provides the context. He's a Jesuit priest, captured and tortured by the Japanese for his faith. Jump to 1640. Two of Ferreira's students, Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garrpe (Adam Driver), are informed that Ferreira has gone AWOL in Japan. The crackdown on Christianity has turned that country into a dangerous place for Christians. Rumours abound that Ferreira has denounced his faith. But Rodrigues and Garrpe believe this is slander, and they set off for Japan to bring Ferreira home. The wandering priests enter a coastal village and are welcomed by the native Japanese, who exist in crushing poverty, struggling under the ruthless, ever-watchful eye of Inoue Masashige (Issey Ogata). Suspected Christians are regularly dragged from their homes and forced to publicly denounce their God by stepping foot on the image of Jesus. This 'trampling' becomes a key weapon and point of conflict in the story. As the Japanese rulers repeatedly state, it is 'just a formality'. But for the flock it means the relinquishing of faith; a surrendering of who they are. It's called 'korobu', literally meaning 'to fall down'.When Rodrigues advises the villagers to go ahead and 'trample', he is applying real-world advice to a punishment that threatens their very existence. Yet what about Rodrigues himself – why should he not heed his own advice? The Japanese believe it's a matter of ego; that Rodrigues is arrogant. But is it not his job to be held to a higher religious standard?The story is seen almost exclusively through the eyes of Rodrigues: his horror at the cruelty of the ruling class; his ambivalent but ultimately loving relationship with Garrpe; his guilt and doubt about his faith and his mission; and finally the extent of his service under a repressive system. After all, what relief can he provide dead? Even if it makes him a hypocrite in life. In the basic plot there are parallels with Heart of Darkness, and by extension Apocalypse Now, although don't expect a crazy Colonel Kurtz showdown. The inevitable confrontation with Ferreira is a philosophical fight. What is found is scary and threatening to Rodrigues, but not for the reasons one might imagine. Indeed, this third act shifts our view of the priests, who were once unquestionably saviours, to something less morally clear. But the greatest parallels are with Scorsese's own film, The Last Temptation of Christ. Like Willem Dafoe's Christ, Garfield's Rodrigues is humanised. He's temperamental, doubtful, even hopeless at times. Always burdened by this divine responsibility, although perhaps less resentful than Nikos Kazantzakis's Son of God. Garfield brings great warmth to the role, and an agonising, largely internalised passion. Special mention must go to the sound design. It's a quiet film but one which is conspicuously bereft of silence. At one point Rodrigues hands a token – a tiny wooden cross – to a poor villager, and it seems to chirrup like a living thing. Scorsese is reminding us that nature is never silent, and rarely is the human mind. By the end, we are left with more questions than answers – which is fine, because they are questions we can all ask of ourselves. Narratively harking back after the lifetime of Rodrigues, we ask: If a person's faith is not permitted to be shown – not fetishised – does that mean it is vanquished? Belief, one might argue, is actually given strength by repressive rules, driven deeper, into the soul of the individual. (Or, for the atheists among us, into the unvoiced subconscious.)All of which makes us look at the broader struggles portrayed throughout the film in general. The Inquisitor frequently refers to Japan as a swamp in whose soil Christianity can never take root. Indeed, as a structured organisation, Christianity may not be able to overthrow the Buddhist order. But on an individual level, leaving aside rituals or tokens, there will always be those who need relief from the burden of their guilt, or who struggle with their personal integrity.In the wake of last year's events, it is sometimes mentioned that we are living in a 'post-truth' world. That truth is the objective kind, whereas the 'truth' to which Silence refers is something different: the truth that beneath the artefacts of our belief systems – the crosses and the books and the veils – lies a shared belief in humanity; a desire for order and community. In portraying the captors and captives in a nuanced way, without madness or outright evil, Scorsese isn't obfuscating this greater truth but illuminating it. At 160 minutes, Silence looks on paper like a slog, but it's briefer than your average Middle-earth movie and it is never dull. This isn't Bela Tarr, where boredom is a currency; there is purpose and drama in every scene, and if you surrender to its perfectly paced lull then you will emerge self-reflective, and quite possibly into the most interesting post-cinema pub conversation ever.",8,6,13,2 January 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," A giant leap
","Kubrick's monolithic mid-period masterpiece is as remarkable as much for what it has NOT influenced in sci-fi filmmaking as what it has. So while special effects took a giant leap in 1968 (thanks in no small part to Douglas Trumball, who would give us a grim new world in 1982 with Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, the original ending to which made use of a series of helicopter shots lent by a certain Mr Kubrick), to this day we still have the sounds of swooshing of ships and zapping lasers in the vacuum of outer space. Then there is also the small matter of awe. Other than Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris, it's hard to think of another example of a science fiction movie with such an unflinching commitment to spiralling wonder.And to think it all came from a (very) short story named The Sentinel - a tall tale about a pyramid-shaped creation half-buried on a Moon populated with 'degenerate plants'. (Well, it was written over 20 years before humans set foot on the thing.) Kubrick and Clarke's screenplay plonks this lunar discovery into the second act of a four-act epic. Long before that there is early, ape-like Man. The mysterious monolith appears to the Moon-Watcher and his flock, perhaps signalling the birth of religion. Jump-cut a couple million years (as you do) and the age of technology reigns - so Man is able to detect a magnetic anomaly on the Moon, which leads Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) to our species' second audience with the strange black block. It's pointing toward Jupiter. So begins the third act, wherein astronauts Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Poole (Gary Lockwood) set sail for the great Red Eye, along with their infallible red-eyed companion, HAL, who represents the pinnacle of Man's technological endeavour. Paradoxically HAL also represents the limitations of technology, inadvertently highlighting the need for Man to transcend his current form. This paves the existential way for the final act, which sees Bowman enter a Jovian Stargate and undergo an exhilarating process of accelerated self-actualization. And then... well, my personal belief is that the final frame is the most profound image in cinema. No, in art.Clarke and Kubrick surround their characters with the clinical environment of technology, almost to the point of fetish - what delightful convenience, what intricate design! - only to strip it all away in the final reel, where some kind of apotheosis occurs in a cosmic hotel room decorated in the design of pre-electronic Earth. Luminous floor aside, we could be back in the time of Enlightenment.Much has been made of the technological prescience of Kubrick and co-writer Clarke. There is Heywood's video call to his daughter (Vivian Kubrick, who would go on to make the documentary The Making of The Shining, as well as score Full Metal Jacket). But look closer and you'll also notice that the screen is FLAT. And what are those contraptions Bowman and Poole use to watch the news on BBC 12? They look an awful lot like a certain popular tablet computer... This was 1968, remember.It's easy to throw around words like 'pompous' and 'pretentious' when viewing conceptual art. Clearly, if a viewer finds it does not affect them on an emotional level, then the natural defence is to attack the intentions of the artist. In the case of 2001: A Space Odyssey, not unlike the National Socialist Party's (mis)appropriation of Nietzsche's 'Ubermensch', it is possible to read the Starchild as a god figure, or perhaps a blandly consoling religious promise of what is to become of us beyond our corporeal suffering. This is a perfectly reasonable interpretation, if argued intelligently. The key word here is 'interpretation', made possible by the bold ambiguity of the text. Fanboy gushing and angry backlash are rendered equally irrelevant in the presence of the wellspring of true debate. Love it or hate it, 2001: A Space Odyssey has substance enough to furnish conversations for centuries to come.For all its grandeur and its intellectual rigidity, this is a warm, often amusing, deeply human film: a celebration of Man's practically infinite synaptic potential.",10,2,6,7 February 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Eternal pleasure
","Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's better-received Being John Malkovich was an amusing but cold oddity; director Michel Gondry's Science of Sleep was not particularly amusing and sickly cute. Sandwiched between was this loving, subtly cautionary romantic 'dramedy' about a young man, Joel (Jim Carrey), undergoing a fantastical scientific operation to remove all memory of his ex-girlfriend, the eccentric Clementine (Kate Winslet). The procedure draws him deep into his subconscious, and we're invited along for the ride. This second collaboration between Kaufman and Gondry (after 2001's Human Nature) has deservedly become something of a cult favourite.Forget Garden State: while Eternal Sunshine shares a desire to explore the truth behind the human condition through a skewed fish-eye lens, it is mercifully free of that film's cloying sentimentality, its narcissism, and its contempt for a mainline predefined as banal. In Garden State, people are kooky but phony, shallow and self-absorbed; Eternal Sunshine's Joel, meanwhile, is powerless against his absorption into the strange fearful passions of his dreams. With impressive psychological literacy, Kaufman and Gondry's film shows us the selfishness of human desire and are - crucially - critical of it. Hollywood loves nothing more than to make lovers of ill-suited characters thrown together by circumstance. Not so here: the joy of watching Joel and Clementine's relationship blossom - and fade - is that it is a product of choice as much as chance, and so it is believable.Winslet puts in a signature performance; her Clementine is the extrovert to Carrey's Joel. Carrey, meanwhile, scribbles out his signature entirely: nary a mug passes across his face. His is a soulful turn of poise and intelligence.Eternal Sunshine finds its home on DVD - by the third or fourth viewing you should have the fractured narrative pretty much sussed. Plus, it's ideal night-in viewing: warm, friendly, funny, and profound. In a cynical and ironic era, it's heartening to watch a film that finds love so alive and so precious. A classic.",9,0,2,12 April 2010
Elysium," Hell above and heaven below
","Another 2013 would-be blockbuster, another disappointment. Neill Blomkamp directed the rip-roaringly splattery District 9, and he's followed it up with the PG-13 cut, with added generic elements thrown in for extra soft padding. District 9 wasn't perfect, but it was full of grim humour and oddball characters, and it was driven by a plot as wild as a rabid dog. Elysium dispenses almost entirely with humour (the sole laugh in our auditorium came two minutes from the end), throws together a bunch of bland stock characters, and its plot is as predictable as its Zimmer-lite musical score.'This is now,' says Blomkamp. His conspiracy theory: The One Percent live in a hermetically-sealed orbiting space-station, enjoying free healthcare, spending their days playing offworld golf. The rest of us are struggling in the dirt, subjected to daily stop-and-searches in the shanty towns covering the overpopulated world's surface. An avoidable accident at work leaves Max (Matt Damon) lethally irradiated. Only Elysium can save him - except he's not a citizen, so he must turn to the local gangsters for help. Max can take down 'The System' and save the world. And off he goes, amped to the... err... max inside an Iron Man-style exoskeleton.There are really bad things about the film. Jodie Foster, an actor I thought incapable of being poor, puts in agonising performance as Jessica Delacourt, her movements twitchy, her delivery uncertain, and her accent visiting every corner of the globe. She's not helped by the script, whose dialogue ranges from the banal to the excruciating, and which is dominated by contrivances, coincidences, and unclear motivations.Damon is fine in a hero role he could do in his sleep - which, given the amount of time Max spends on his knees or unconscious, is practically what he does. When he clunks into spasms of action the movie briefly comes alive. But while the action scenes have weight and some imagination, they are mostly shot in the infuriating hand-held style, combined with hyperactive editing, which makes them difficult to follow.If ever there was a movie that was screaming out for Paul Verhoeven to come along and inject some wit, energy, and clarity, it's this one. There are themes in this movie, but they aren't explored, they're presented - or, worse, preached. What could have been simple, satirical super-hybrid face-off in the vein of Battle Angel Alita turns out to be another drab appeal to the senses, none of which are stimulated, with or without neural implants.",5,3,6,21 August 2013
Avatar," The wave finally breaks
","With a tale built on great excess came excessive criticisms at both ends of the spectrum. So is Avatar the most awesome spectacle in cinematic history, or a dire, blue-hued re-telling of Dances with Wolves? In truth it's neither. It's simply (emphasis on 'simply') an enjoyable sci-fi romp – albeit one that could have done with a little more science and a little less romp.We come to terms fairly quickly with the fact that we're not dealing with three-dimensional characters, but rather archetypes playing out in 3D. So Pandora and her population's plight takes centre stage. It's a laudable allegory about Native American displacement, massacre, and Five Nations coalition. Except here the animism is more than spiritual delusion, being a detectable, neuro-chemical network stretching across the entire biosphere. Sadly this interesting concept is only properly explored in a single five-minute scene; and yet Jake Sully's (a blank Sam Worthington) adoption of his flying steed, with all its rippling wings and nose-diving peril, lasts three times that.Which perhaps represents Avatar's greatest problem. Cameron is so in love with his world, and so intent on making us fall in love with it, that we spend too much time in idle admiration. No wonder the natives are known as 'The People' – they exist as a single narrative entity as tour guides for Cameron's dreamy interior. As Sully predictably falls for Neytiri (a luminous Zoe Saldana), it's really the world he's learning to love, not her.Special mention should go to Stephen Lang for his joyous pantomime performance as the monstrous Colonel Quaritch, and the first bearable performance from Giovanni Ribisi since... well... ever.With Titanic and now Avatar, Cameron seems to be letting The Abyss's climactic wave crash; taking a new delight in observing the stupefaction of crowds of little people as he unleashes upon them his thunderous acts of god. (Now in 3D!) Given the director's considerable ego, I wonder if, in the dreamboat passengers tossed about like ragdolls, and in the twisted faces of his Na'vi, awed and agape, it might be you and I he sees.",7,0,3,1 May 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Bizarre! Metaphorical! Sardonic!
","The reasons behind the troubled release of Stanley Kubrick's jet black comedy satire have been misread over the years (I would go so far as to say deliberately mis-written by the tabloid press) meaning that when the film finally received a posthumous UK release it was assumed that the film was previously 'banned' on the basis of copycat incidents. In fact, Kubrick himself demanded the film never be shown in his adopted country out of fear for his family's safety, following hate mail and death threats, the exact content and source of which may never be known.That is not to say the film is NOT shocking. The violence inflicted by Little Alex (Malcolm MacDowell, fresh off that other anti-establishment classic If...) and his droogs is deliberately, sickeningly glorified; it's as if they are playing out their fantasies as if performing on some great stage, complete with their own Shakespearean-style syntax not spoken by straight-cued Ma 'n' Pa (Philip Stone and Sheila Raynor). One of the opening scenes is a ludicrously exaggerated fist-fight played out in a deserted theatre.Very few redeeming characters raise their head above the mire. As a result, we, as an audience, are left in the unenviable position of sympathising with the calculated, and later stricken, rapist and murderer at the film's centre. Or rather, we are forced to sympathise with his predicament: stripped of his free will, is he truly human at all? Even HAL 9000, the homicidal super-computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey, possessed the power of choice.Superficially, this is the most dated of Kubrick's films, distinguished by psychedelic art design straight from the turn-of-the-decade era. But we should not allow this to detract from the fact that Kubrick and (original novel writer) Anthony Burgess' future vision is essentially a stylised depiction of logical sociological progression, complete with hyperbole, and just because today's thugs DON'T maraud in bowler hats and over-sized codpieces, spouting pidgin Russian over pints of alcoholic milk, does not make the film-makers' alternative version of reality any less convincing. Nor less relevant: as always, Kubrick's themes are timeless.",9,1,2,12 April 2010
The Fly," Bloody (and) Brilliant
","The Fly marks the central point of David Cronenberg's distinguished directorial career so far. He would achieve a certain tabloid notoriety a decade later with the laughable Crash, but this story of loner scientist Seth Brundle's (Jeff Goldblum) fusion with a house fly strikes the perfect balance between Cronenberg's ongoing exploration of squishy body parts and mainstream cinema's demands for high concept genre conventions.It would first appear that the genre in question is horror. Indeed, many of the final scenes, including the gooey Grand Guignol ending, are straight from the splatter canon. There is method to this madness: Seth is dying - literally falling apart; and the insect in him - brutal, totally without compassion or table manners - is taking over. Off go his ears and out fall his teeth. And yet Brundlefly's heart remains untouched - except, that is, by his writer girlfriend, Ronnie (Geena Davis). Here amongst Chris Walas's fantastic make-up is an old-fashioned Hollywood love story. Perhaps that's why audiences have found The Fly the most accessible of his films: because, whether through straightforward exposition or blood-soaked metaphor, an affecting story of love and jealousy shines through. By the end, you won't be certain you've watched a horror film at all. You may also be convinced that life is a 75-year process of decay, but that's Cronenberg's trick: deep meanings in simple, stark images.",7,0,1,12 April 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," Toothless
","Rubbish title. Let's just get that out the way right now. It sounds like a working title that no one ever bothered changing.Dreamworks Animation Studio hardly provide intellectual competition for Pixar, but with the Shrek and Madagascar franchises, they certainly give kids a lot of what they want. With its comparatively sullen hues and a largely bodily function-free range of jokes, How to Train Your Dragon is likely to appeal to slightly older children. Not teenagers, but the bright brand of tweens who'll drool over the scene in which our bumbling hero, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), scans through a Book of Dragons, which acts like a kind of Dark Age movie merchandise catalogue.There's nothing drastically wrong with re-imagining the Vikings as victims defending their villages. But perhaps the film's closing pacifist sentiment comes across as a little disingenuous, given how much fun we've had watching arena battles and hundred-foot reptiles tear down mountains. I mean, after 90 minutes of rucking, will a child really want to put aside their plastic axe? Heavens no (or, indeed, Valhalla no) – he'll collect the toys, with their meticulously-moulded beards and scales, and play Dragon Massacre at Viking Village.But an enjoyable adventure nonetheless. The cast is excellent, once you get over the fact that the 28 year-old Baruchel sounds exactly what he is, which is fifteen years too old. And the 3D is dynamic and arresting without being distractingly self-referential.",6,4,14,26 April 2010
Jack Reacher," Reach for the star vehicle
","This is the first of a potential franchise, based upon the page-turners by prolific British author Lee Child. Based on the novel One Shot, Jack Reacher opens with an apparently psychotic sniper spree, which turns out to be part of a broader mystery, to be investigated (in his own pugilistic way) by the wandering title character (Tom Cruise), along with the lawyer (Rosamund Pike) who'll be defending the accused.The plot is a procedural join-the-dots job, whose preposterousness starts amusing but becomes wearying. As is often the case, the tiny details (usually involving Reacher's photographic memory) are more interesting than the big twists. At 90 minutes, this could have had some of the rampant energy and briskness of a film like Salt. But the script is cripplingly talky, directly at odds with the self-proclaimed pragmatism of the titular hero. There's a great-looking car chase to relieve us from the reams of discursive dialogue, but it comes to nothing much, feeling forced like that strange airport action sequence shoehorned into Casino Royale.Worse, entire scenes drop dead before our eyes. There's a moment where Reacher confronts Sandy, a vulnerable girl (who'll test the 12A certificate by getting brutally punched out, much like the opening of Christopher McQuarrie's last film, The Way of the Gun), and it feels like we have to wait an eternity before she gets to the point... only for Reacher to return for yet more chat. And then there's the moment when Reacher gazes into an office block and makes an ear-rippingly pretentious speech about how the little people are trapped, and if they could live their life again, they'd live like him. You mean live a nomadic existence, building no intimate relationships, killing without mercy and constantly on the run from the law? No thanks, Mr Reacher.On the plus side, there's a reasonably exciting final shootout, admirably filmed in medium shot and not edited to a state of incomprehensibility - a rarity these days. And there are sold supporting turns from David Oyelowo and the ever-reliable Richard Jenkins.Other performances don't land on two feet. I was looking forward to Werner Herzog (as baddie 'The Zec') showing up and injecting some campness into proceedings, but the great director is not a great actor, and it sounds like he's reciting from an earpiece. Rosamund Pike, a decent actress forever slumming it, seems to have been instructed to wear a permanent rabbit/headlights expression.And then there's Mr Cruise. I kept looking at Jai Courtney (who plays the hotshot Charlie), and wondering, with his superior height and brooding, thuggish demeanour, whether he would not be a more logical choice for the brawny giant at the film's stony heart. Instead we get Tom Cruise, ball-busting blokes and seducing women with his mere presence, at the centre of 'A Tom Cruise Production'.",4,7,15,30 December 2012
The Fountain," Flawed but true
","If Pi took us through the trials of purgatory and Requiem For A Dream gave us a taste of hell then there is something heavenly about Darren Aronofsky's latest. Clearly he never had in mind to limit his intimate romantic drama to the confines of genre, feasibility, or even planet Earth. The film has predictably polarised the opinion of critics. It seems that the more personal the vision, the more extreme the critical response; whenever a vision such as Aronofsky's comes along the condemnation is vicious and the praise is lavish.He could have done what he wanted after the stupendously grim Requiem for a Dream. The marketing bods must have been cracking their knuckles in glee when they'd found someone who shot violent neo-noir who they could sell as the new David Fincher. But instead he ended up six years later completing a metaphysical love story, full of light, and ultimately hopeful.Some critics have made comparisons between this and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I believe thematic comparisons are erroneous. Certainly, the film provides similar challenges (and possibly confusion) for its audience. But 2001 had bigger fish to fry - the post-Nietzschean rebirth of God, no less - while The Fountain is filmed in close-up. 2001 was about the power of Man; The Fountain is about one powerless man and his inevitable defeat.Regardless of whether you find The Fountain mysterious and moving or a pretentious bore, Aronofksy's conviction is undeniable. In an industry steadily becoming saturated with product placement sequels and depressing remakes, it's refreshing to lie back and be presented with a truly unique vista. It's as much about capturing a single emotion - the most elusive of all - as it is about telling a story. And, if nothing else, life in a Petri dish sure looks pretty.",7,0,1,12 April 2010
Die Hard," The weather outside is frightful - but Bruce is stuck indoors
","Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a swaggering New York cop who arrives in LA to patch things up with his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia, who would be sorely missed in the second sequel). Unfortunately, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) has also come to town. He takes Holly and her work colleagues hostage on the 30th floor in a bid to bide time while his goons break into the vault to steal 600 million dollars in bearer bonds. McClane, meanwhile, is loose amongst the building's lift shafts and air vents, picking off Gruber's men with a pistol and a one-liner.Let's leave aside the Nakatomi Plaza's phallic presence (complete with climactic rooftop explosion) and concentrate on the people in it. John McClane: he's the sort of action hero who can chain smoke filterless European cigarettes before sprinting up four flights of stairs, having a fist fight and then leaping off a 40-storey building with a fire hose wrapped round his waist. Gruber, paradoxically, and yet strangely likewise, is precisely who we would want to be if we were a ruthless global criminal: suave, literate, deadly; an 'exceptional thief'.Events build up and up until we have a proper cat-and-mouse story. The odds are stacked against McClane: he's outnumbered, out-gunned, and out-shoed. But he's also a resilient fellow - a stubborn working man stuck in his ways - and he doesn't care much for foreign types trespassing on the ranch. For all the incredulity of many of our hero's actions, he is an everyman; forget juggernauts versus jet fighters - this incarnation of McClane huffs and puffs and bleeds. It HURTS jumping off a building, and he's modern enough to show it.Along the way we meet some neatly written side characters, most of whom belong to the bumbling good guys. Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson (Paul Gleason) is scoping for promotion; journalist Richard Thornburg (the hilarious William Atherton, effectively reprising his role from Ghost Busters) sniffs a Pulitzer; and FBI agents Johnson and Johnson (Robert Davi and Grand L. Bush) just want to chew gum and get the job done with acceptable hostage losses.McTiernan is a peerless action director when he's on form (see also Predator and Die Hard With a Vengeance), and this is his pinnacle, harking from the days when stunts meant stunts, not green-screen. Thumbs-up to cinematographer Jan de Bont, too, for proving that his best work is done on another director's leash. And Michael Kamen's score - foreboding and triumphant in equal measures - is so good it barely changed a note for three movies.",8,2,3,12 April 2010
Zero Dark Thirty," Propaganda done properly
","Zero Dark Thirty is a procedural CIA-based thriller in the mould of TV's Homeland. This film, however, is based on real-life events, so it doesn't have the benefit of being able to withhold in the way Homeland's first series did with Twin Peaks-like delectation. What Zero Dark Thirty does have is a narrative based on first-hand accounts, and it makes no explicit judgement about the content of those accounts. We simply get to see what (apparently) happened during the manhunt for 'UBJ'.The film's lack of polemic is both a blessing a curse. It's a blessing because it's rare that a film dealing with such volatile subject matter is depicted procedurally. Usually when a narrative is made ostensibly apolitical it's as a result of an unconvincing moral rebalancing, where the filmmakers go to great lengths to present both sides fairly. But Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow's disinterest is also a curse because, in avoiding judgement, it surreptitiously falls firmly on the side of the CIA. It shows what it's allowed to show, but keeps their secrets ('undisclosed location' and all that); and it portrays the operatives as the honourable front-liners getting their hands dirty (but not bloody), beyond moral reproach by virtue of hard graft. In Bigelow's world, it's the suits in Washington who have the blood in their hands - they're disconnected, as evidenced when torture-specialist Dan (Jason Clarke) returns to US headquarters from the field and loses his nerve, becoming a man of soft probabilities.Clarke is solid but lost amidst superior talent, as he was in John Hillcoat's recent Lawless. Jessica Chastain delivers a nuanced performance. Driven professionals in films often come across as stolid, but Chastain is an actor of subtlety - even if Bigelow can't help lensing her like a wind-swept movie star in the Middle Eastern magic light. Jennifer Ehle uses her moon-faced radiance to good effect, filling her eager operative Jessica with youthful energy. There's a fair amount of distracting spot-the-cameo going on, particularly toward the end, when Joel Edgerton, Mark Duplass and James Gandolfini turn up.Bigelow's directorial talent is never in doubt. The final sequence in particular is harrowingly tense, even though we know the outcome. And she generally gets the best out of actors. But make no mistake: this is a deeply patriotic film which is cheering for the home team, and it does so under the guise of objectivity, which makes it more manipulative than flag-waving fare like Last Ounce of Courage or Act of Valor, albeit much more skilfully made.",6,26,47,28 January 2013
12 Years a Slave," Come and see
","I want to put into words how this film affected me, but, appropriately enough, there aren't the words there. Steve McQueen's adaptation of Solomon Northup's memoir is a film in which words are precious and very carefully chosen – whether shouted or sung or uttered in whispers out of earshot of the savage ruling class.Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free man tricked into slavery. The story charts his ordeal – and those of countless others – under the tortuous watchfulness of a series of plantation owners, cruellest of whom is Edwin Epps (McQueen regular Michael Fassbender). It is a film whose relentless scenes of abuse are punctuated by levity of only the most desperate and solemn kind, and which is determinedly unbothered by the comforts of sentimentality.Ejiofor captures the agony at the heart of Northup, from the initial indignity of his situation, through physical torture endured, observed and committed, to the brutal annihilation of his character through supremacist re-education. In place of the stock conclusions drawn by Hollywood, John Ridley's script has other ideas: rather than rousing speeches there are bursts of quickly-suppressed anger; instead of soaring emotion, upon release Northup remains bound in the shackles of guilt left upon him by the guilty.As with his previous films (Hunger and Shame), McQueen embeds meaning in the frame. These aren't pretty images for the sake of it. The burning of a letter represents the dwindling of hope – and yet how long it seems to take to dwindle, and we linger until every sliver of fire is spent, staring ever harder for the remaining light in the darkness. Northup is staring also, unblinking, into the abyss of humanity around him, holding out for some such glimmer.In terms of characterisation (do we call them characters if these monsters truly existed?), Ridley and McQueen's greatest decision is to give as much depth to the masters as their slaves. Epps is a vile creature, but we are dared to empathise with him as he impotently hands the whip to Northup, under the emasculating gaze of his jealous wife (Sarah Paulson). The object of Epps' violently ambivalent affections is Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) an angel in a world where the beautiful and the talented are particularly prized for self-sanctified hatred.So it seems I have found the words to describe a little of my experience of watching this remarkable film. It's a reminder that cinema is not solely a reserve of entertainment, and that the atrocities of humankind sometimes need to be shown to us – nakedly, harrowingly, unforgettably.",9,6,12,10 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," How much is that doggy..?
","Martin Scorsese's latest retains all of the energy that is his signature, but fails to fill its overgenerous duration with enough substantial content. The emptiness and lack of ethical backbone holding up U.S. capitalism in the eighties is explained in the first fifteen minutes, with Matthew McConaughey's Mark Hanna telling us it's nothing but 'fairy dust' - empty promises - to the unknowing customer, but hard cash to the stockbroker. Half an hour in, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a multimillionaire... and we're only a sixth of the way through the movie.The rest is an uneasy mix of gross-out and slapstick humour and bellowing domestic drama. In Goodfellas, we cared when Henry's and Karen's marriage was collapsing because we empathised - we'd seen Henry's rise from brutalised child, to errand boy, to made man. Belfort starts as a self-confessed greedy misogynist, and then we watch him swell his turgid aspiration, with all the coke and hookers this entails. Belfort isn't a million miles from DiCaprio's Gatsby - except there's no tragedy here. He's repellent from start to finish, with barely a mote of humanity for us to cling to. Unfortunately, in terms of character and theme, this greaseball and his greed are all the movie gives us. Terence Winter's script is full of incidents, most of which are drawn out and light on significance, and only occasionally funny.DiCaprio is brilliantly broad yet nuanced as Belfort. Jonah Hill is amusing as his horse-toothed sidekick, Donnie. Scorsese's style is in abundance, the camera rarely still, like a living creature snuffling in the muck. But Thelma Schoonmaker needed stricter instructions in the editing suite. Do we really need to see another tiresome orgy? Is the sight of DiCaprio crawling into a Lamborghini really funny enough to consume five minutes of screen time? It would be okay if there was some profound moral conclusion awaiting us at the end, but what we actually get (or appear to get) is the cheeky verification of Belfort's assertion that deep down we all wanna be richer, right now. If it's Winter's and Scorsese's intention to make me feel indignant at this, and make me hate investment bankers more, then fine. But it's a tough watch for such an easy target.",5,4,8,19 January 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The frustration of the 144 minutes
","What a difference an Extended Edition makes. For the first part we got some jolly embellishment. For The Desolation of Smaug we got bags more depth and character. For The Battle of the Five Armies, it may - I hope - be transformative. Because right now this feels like An Unfinished Journey.It's as if, after all the complaints about splitting a pamphlet of a novel into three parts, Peter Jackson is playing a joke on us: This is what you get when you ask for Middle-earth-lite. Characters we've come to love or loathe arc into nothing; others (e.g. Beorn and Radagast) are given literally seconds of screen time; and for the first time in this prequel trilogy, a whole chapter (The Return Journey) is pretty much elided entirely.I'd like to be clear on my admiration for what Peter Jackson has done with The Hobbit so far. For all The Lord of the Rings' mythic grandeur and complex world-building, there's a warm geniality and brisk impetus to these lovingly crafted films. And those qualities are married to a thematic depth missing from its bedtime story source. Home and borders are themes that have run through this trilogy, from Bilbo's (Martin Freeman) heartfelt declaration of solidarity at the end of An Unexpected Journey, to Kili's (Aidan Turner) fevered speech to Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) as she heals his wounds in Desolation, when they realise reconciliation is possible. Heck, I even like the addition of Tauriel - though her unsatisfying conclusion is perhaps typical of a final chapter that too often fails to tie up its loose ends.The movie kicks off from precisely where the second ended, with the dread dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) descending upon Laketown. The citizens flee but nothing can stop the cataclysm - until a certain someone finds an ingenious way to pierce the beast. Then there's nemesis #2: Sauron (also Cumberbatch). We get to see some familiar faces face-off with this faceless monstrosity.The story then enters its most intriguing phase: a kind of psychodrama involving Thorin (Richard Armitage) and his sickening relationship with gold and power. It's the one time we really glimpse that signature Jackson oddness, in a wonderful hallucinatory sequence where Thorin imagines he's sinking in a lake of gold.The narrative follows the book fairly closely. This was, after all, the stage of the story where Professor Tolkien finally foregrounded politics and ethics and the machinations of characters ahead of adventure. The film is at its most successful in the quieter moments, as Thranduil (a subtle Lee Pace) ponders the duty of the elves; as Bard (a brooding Luke Evans) comes to the gate of the mountain to plead for peace; and as Thorin struggles with his 'dragon-sickness' (i.e. greed), while Bilbo wrestles with the dilemma of what to do with a certain stolen gemstone.Thorin was presented at first as this trilogy's Aragorn. But over time we've learned of the dangerous pride that ruined his grandfather. Thorin's hubris and arrogance is in stark contrast to Bilbo's very relatable and achievable traits of decency and humility. The gulf between them is intriguing and wisely plundered for drama. Armitage and Bilbo provide the best performances of the film - mostly internal; mostly in the eyes - and their farewell is one of the more moving moments in a trilogy that has largely prioritised humour over pathos.The battle itself is undoubtedly impressive - great roaring hordes punctuated with spectacular giants - but in a sense it compounds the problem of the relatively truncated runtime. What was already the shortest Middle-earth film is rendered artificially even shorter by the fact that there's 45 minutes of virtually wordless fighting. By now we should all be braced for Super Legolas and his physics-defying fighting style. That reaches new heights here; as he sprints up a crumbling bridge like he's on the wrong escalator, it's like some sort of visual satire on the weightlessness of CGI.With its last bastion and swarming armies, the titular battle resembles The Return of the King's Pelennor finale - yet that movie took breath between its showdowns. Galadriel vs. Sauron; Legolas vs. Bolg; Thorin vs. Azog... it's like we're watching someone finish off a video game but we're powerless to stop them skipping the tension- or character-building cutscenes. Moreover, the dubious editing decisions create some strange and jolting juxtapositions and tonal lurches, and negate the sense of time passing or of great distances being crossed.The result is a film that really earns its status of 'theatrical cut', insofar as it resembles many a boisterous blockbuster. This is fairly damning criticism for a Middle-earth movie, usually so luxurious and layered in its sense of a unique world. There's plenty of meat here - but where are the bones that hold it all together? 11 months away, perhaps.",5,384,589,14 December 2014
Inception," Unexceptional
","Christopher Nolan's disappointing follow-up to The Dark Knight has an intriguing enough premise. It's just a pity the man himself couldn't have settled for a 'Story by' credit and let someone else – perhaps his brother? – take up the quill and ink. Because the only respite we get from the barrage of exposition occurs during one of the many exciting, imaginative action sequences. (The cliff-side finale is not among them, sadly.) Perhaps Nolan wanted to make absolutely sure that the audience knew what was at stake by the time the corridors started to flip and the subconscious snow started tumbling down the mountain. Even his symbolism is spelled out, lest we miss a moment of the craftsman's genius: it's like watching Tarkovsky with the writer's commentary blaring over the top.As you may or may not (or even wish to) know, the plot involves a moody widower (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team of Wall Street extras infiltrating the subconscious of the son (Cillian Murphy) of a wealthy businessman (Pete Postlethwaite). Being a self-proclaimed mind-bender doesn't excuse the series of convolutions that puts the team at actual risk, but suffice to say, down this deep we're pretty much in the Wes Craven school of dying in your sleep, or near enough.Leonardo DiCaprio is at his spitting best; Joseph Gordon-Levitt is wasted on action duties; Michael Caine is... oh no, he's gone; Marion Cotillard screams like a cat; Tom Hardy shines.For me, the most disappointing aspect lies in the fact that this is a dream film without a single, solitary dream-like image. Nothing uncanny, eerie, unsettling or psychologically askew. Perhaps this is how Nolan dreams – in solidly defined 'levels', with straight-lined origami cities, empty of metaphor or oneiric imagery. Nolan's dreamscape is a pristine museum, carefully and verbosely labelled, occasionally confusing, but not in a fun way; ultimately nothing more than a playground for confident men in tailored suits.",5,17,40,16 July 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," Uninspired Illumination animation
","Surely a case of concept first/plot comes later, The Secret Life of Pets is the latest feature from Illumination, the animation studio responsible for (to blame for?) everything Minions-related. Though there are references, Pets wisely doesn't try to replicate the little yellow army. But while the new movie does its own thing, I'm not sure it will have the simple, resilient appeal of the Despicable series.Jack Russell terrier Max (Louis C. K.) lives in a Manhattan apartment block, populated by all kinds of apparently perfect pets who lead rebellious shadow lives while their owners are away. Max adores his master. So when she brings home a stray dog, Duke (Eric Stonestreet), a fierce rivalry begins.One day they are out for a walk when Duke decides to get Max into trouble by dragging him off the beaten track. Duke and Max come up against a gang of cats, led by the vicious Ozone (Steve Coogan). After being captured by Animal Control, the dogs are inadvertently rescued by a rabbit called Snowball (Kevin Hart), who introduces them to The Flushed Pets, a society of forgotten animals who live in the sewer. The encounter triggers a series of farcical events against the backdrop of Max's and Duke's journey home – and of course their burgeoning friendship.My synopsis doesn't scratch the surface of what is a weirdly complicated storyline. I've named but a fraction of the enormous cast. The film suffers from a damaging overabundance of characters resulting in a ridiculously busy plot. Combined with its vehement slapstick focus and almost complete lack of pathos, it's a dizzying ADHD experience which is aimed at the very young and the very excitable.Beyond the titular premise there is little invention or originality. Lovely animation infuses the animals with personality. But they aren't helped by a rote script which puts a frankly boring, not-particularly-odd couple front and centre while sidelining the potentially interesting creatures (Albert Brooks' pathologically predatory hawk is briefly hilarious).Some jokes strike, even if the pacing makes them fleeting. My personal favourite moment was in the sewers and a visual reference to Super Mario Bros' dashing green Koopa shells. But too many big punchlines land softly, spread across too many plot threads. If it feels like we're watching a series of vignettes then that's surely telling us that this is a short film stretched to scattering point.Perhaps it's because it comes so soon after another anthropomorphised animal animation, Zootropolis, with its vibrancy and its depth, that Pets comes across as so visually dull and narratively rudimentary. In a post-Pixar world, 'just a kids' film' doesn't cut it. A mediocre film is a mediocre film, even one with moments of individual brilliance – all of which, I can report, can be seen in the trailers.",4,7,25,3 July 2016
Arrival," Interdependence Day
","As Amy Adams' opening voice-over speaks in sad lyrical strokes, and director Denis Villenueve's lens slides slowly through her empty home, and Johann Johannson's mournful music breathes in the background, we know we're not watching Independence Day. Adams plays Louise, a linguist seemingly grieving for her daughter. Louise is last to know that twelve colossal spacecraft have entered the Earth's atmosphere and are now hovering in various locations around the globe. Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker), who has a bit of previous with Louise, invites her to join a team who will enter one of the alien crafts and try to communicate with them. The rest of the movie is set largely in a military base in the shadow of the alien craft. The camera meekly moves beneath the huge hovering object, as if anxiously averting its eyes. The sense of awe is palpable and appropriate, filling the audience with a thrilling dread as the crew creep – and float – inside. The sparse design of the alien ship interior is fantastically foreboding, and the form of its pilots is convincing in its otherworldliness. I won't describe them; I'll just say they're named 'heptapods'. The humans attempt to communicate. While Louise uses words and gestures, the heptapods rely on a kind of hieroglyphic language made from ejected ink. It's pleasingly weird and graceful. These first encounters are the most engaging, successfully giving the sense of an impenetrable barrier between species. Fans of modern epic sci-fi won't be bowled over by the core message, but I won't name names for fear of giving away the mildest of surprises.The sombre colour-drained style may be standard these days, but Villenueve contrasts it effectively with Louise's memories of her daughter. The editing throughout the film is textured and nuanced, even if it does collapse into a malaise of generalised Big Feelings in the end. Still, the quality of craftsmanship and the doomy style bode well for the director's upcoming Blade Runner sequel. For all the heavyweight actors, the supporting characters – from the gruff, pragmatic military leader to the slimy CIA suit – are stock for the genre. Adams is typically soulful and skillful, while Renner, to his credit, tries his best in a role written to be playful, except he's under the thrall of a director who doesn't really do play. Arrival isn't completely cohesive. There's some of the hard sci-fi slog of The Andromeda Strain, but also the socially conscious grandstanding of The Day the Earth Stood Still. Both are great movies (and both by Robert Wise) – but are they great bedfellows?Tonally I was reminded of Another Earth, a similarly mournful, cerebral sci-fi movie with a metaphysical twist. But that movie wore its melon-twisting conceit on its sleeve, as opposed to the Nolan- esque puzzle box narrative gradually unveiled in Arrival. As twists go, this one is ambitious: a clever cop-out or a mind-expanding revelation depending on taste. Your capacity for feeling moved may depend on your feelings about the bow-wrapped ending of Interstellar. Along with Interstellar, a major touchstone is Robert Zemeckis's Contact, which also focused on a passionate female protagonist driven by grief. Contact's depiction of an invaded world swallowing itself whole through reactionary insanity was more fun and more convincing, although I guess the overblown public reaction in Arrival may speak more to the current feverish state of US politics. Arrival suffers from many familiar elements, and a script that can't match the sumptuous visual style, the committed performances, or the unique production design. Perhaps a little more lightness of touch may have alleviated the slippery slope of the film's neat-yet- divisive second half. But there's no denying that this is impressive, technically astounding filmmaking with an unapologetic intention to awe. Worth seeing – and worth seeing BIG.",7,4,18,9 November 2016
The Conjuring," Something new, something old
","James Wan directed the original (and best) Saw, the poorly received Dead Silence, and later Insidious, Chapter 2 of which will be his second movie of 2013. He's developing into a modern Master of Horror, but it looks like he may be removing himself from that typecasting as he prepares to direct the seventh instalment of Fast & Furious, which presumably won't involve any dead-eyed smiling dolls. It would be a pity if he was done with horror, because The Conjuring is a very good horror movie. What it is NOT is original. At all. It's more like a greatest hits of the genre, specifically the exorcism sub-genre.The plot, based on 'actual events' (a claim which, if anything, nullifies some of the terror), involves the wholesome Perron family (helmed by Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor) moving into a rustic farmhouse, which is frankly begging to be haunted. The fact that there are no less than five daughters gives ample opportunity for creepy blindfold games and exploration, and soon they're unwittingly uncovering the gruesome secret past of the house and grounds. As the hauntings mount up, the Ma and Pa Perron call in demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga). They're the ones who 'did' Amityville. Cameras and microphones are set up to gather evidence, so that they can apply for an exorcism. At this point the movie becomes like Poltergeist, except actually scary.A film this formulaic shouldn't work, but the ferociously familiar elements - rocking chairs, doors, whispers, crashes, dolls, Catholics, imaginary friends, mirrors, music boxes, mirrors inside music boxes - are presented so skilfully by both cast and crew that it's hard not to be drawn in. The performances are first rate; the cinematography is exquisite; the pacing is perfect; and the script is better than it needs to be, with some moving moments as sanity levels slip away. These 'real life' evil demons seem to have an uncanny knack for patiently building tension and teasing their audience - I mean victims - before they get on with the really nasty stuff. But that build-up makes for a riveting three quarters of a film.As the film picks up steam it also picks up some annoying habits - specifically the tendency of modern horror to confuse the scary with the startling, and resort to increasing physicality, shouting, and crash cuts as a crescendo to the effective slow-burn. Put it this way: A little girl telling her sister there's someone standing behind her stays with you longer than a grown woman being tossed around like a ragdoll.This almost feels like a full-stop for the traditional mainstream horror movie; a distillation of all that the genre does well, done very well. Perhaps it's Wan's way of signing off, closing the book on things that go bump and clocks that stop at unearthly hours, to allow some new visionary to come along and try something new. But this one last time the old ways work just fine.",6,0,1,4 August 2013
Prometheus," Prometheus has landed with a plop
","I just came out of the cinema and then watched the trailer for Prometheus for the first time and I can safely say that you might as well stick with the trailer. It's the entire film in fast-forward. This is an origin story in the most fundamental sense, claiming to offer profound insight regarding our distant beginnings. But rather than raising questions about the meaning of existence and the notion of creation, you'll be asking some searching questions about the quality of what you just saw. The Alien universe has been hijacked in recent years by twaddle like AVP and its execrable sequel. The seams began to fray back in 1993 when a rookie David Fincher was hired to direct a script that came across like a clone gone wrong, and it was followed by the woefully misguided comedy-horror Alien Resurrection. So upon hearing that Ridley Scott, director of the original Alien – a B-movie elevated to art – was planning a return to the series, I was genuinely excited. The result is a narrative disaster with an embarrassing script, which is further undone by some irrational casting choices. The Prometheus mission must represent the most reckless, impatient, unprofessional scientific expedition in the history of mankind. Biologists prod and poke with gay abandon while geologists go wandering like they're kids exploring an abandoned farmhouse. Why not perform a meteorological survey before leaving the ship, so that you aren't cut off by a biblical storm? Why are you getting blazing drunk just after making the most important discovery in the history of mankind? Why are you, captain, allowing this crew-member, pronounced dead moments earlier, back onto the ship without the merest whisper of quarantine? All sense of wonder or intrigue is stolen by baffling motivations, incongruent characterisation, and infuriating plot holes. Ridley Scott, even at his worst, usually makes movies that are undeniably his own, with distinctive production design. But Prometheus, sadly, could have been envisioned by any talented hack. It looks more like Brian De Palma's garish flop Mission to Mars; a far cry from the artistic gleam of JJ Abrams' Star Trek or the convincing grubbiness of Duncan Jones' Moon. Perhaps it's the over-reliance on CG, or the insistence upon 3D, but Prometheus is tainted by that uniquely modern sheen: a blandly precise computerised look, like an uncanny aura that surrounds all the human beings and steals any sense of immersion, locking us out of the frame.For some reason Noomi Rapace was chosen to play the part of Englishwoman Elizabeth Shaw, and while she's fine for the physical stuff (including a brilliantly conceived operation-from-hell) she delivers her lines poorly. Charlize Theron is eminently watchable but like many of the characters she often acts in a somewhat contradictory manner. Guy Pearce was presumably chosen for the part of the extremely elderly Weyland for the sake of his viral promo – he simply looks like a young man in make- up. Michael Fassbender, as the robot David, is the star of the show, building on the sinister twitches that made Bishop (Lance Henrikson) and Ash (Ian Holm) so subtly menacing in the first two films.I'm struggling to find positives. There is the occasional effective set- piece, such as the storm sequence, some icky first encounters, and the aforementioned invasive operation, but the characters are so inconsistent and/or underdeveloped that all sense of threat is undone by audience indifference. Now I'm going to watch Alien and Aliens, back-to-back, and then perhaps, grudgingly, Alien 3. I'm starting to think that's all we ever needed.",3,101,176,2 June 2012
Paths of Glory," A true anti-war polemic
","Too many war films claim to condemn their subject matter with one hand whilst making pornographic use of battlefield bloodshed with the other. Kubrick's second studio picture, banned in France until 1975, was truly controversial, but not because of the violence.The plot is simple: General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) asks General Mireau (George Macready) to command his division to storm the Ant Hill, an unassailable German target across no-man's land. Sniffing promotion, Mireau agrees. And so it is down to Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) to undertake the impossible mission. When it fails, Mireau blames Dax's soldiers, and three of them are chosen to be tried for cowardice. The trial turns out to be Dax's second impossible mission.At under 90 minutes, it's remarkable how many themes are explored. And these are the big ones, too: courage, belief, fear and, most significantly, humanity. Dax is a moral man in a war-torn world where humanity does not exist - and not simply on the battlefield, but in the general's headquarters. All hope seems spent when Broulard confronts Dax in one of the final scenes, and is surprised to find that the colonel's actions truly came from a position of morality. But then some light in the darkness: a German singer (Susanne Christian, who would later become Kubrick's wife) touches the souls of his men; observing the scene reminds Dax that hope does still exist - just not in war.",9,0,1,12 April 2010
Despicable Me," The best film Pixar never made
","This was a huge surprise. As a supposedly mature grown-up, there was no reason for me to watch Despicable Me, let alone enjoy it, and yet I did watch it and found out there was every reason. This French-made and English-spoken animation is funny, sweet, imaginative, surreal, and touching without resorting to sentimentality.At the centre of it all is a pitch-perfect vocal performance from Steve Carrell as Gru (spot the 'Gru-ray Disc' visual gag at the end), a wannabe global villain who covets a shrink ray in the possession of his arch-nemesis Vector (Jason Segel). With it he intends to go into space and steal the Moon. That's the plot, but the real story is Gru's relationship with three orphans, whom he intends at first to exploit, but who will ultimately tap into his coal-black heart.I like the dynamic between Gru and the orphans in that they don't so much inspire a magical change in each other as come to accept each other. The orphans, at a cruel and mischievous age themselves, learn to adore Gru's monstrous behaviour, and in return Gru comes to appreciate and respond to their neediness - a neediness that he himself possesses, locked deep inside. Gru is correcting the mistakes of his own loveless upbringing.Of course, this is all fairly implicit. The winning Disney-Pixar formula demands tearshed and laughter in equal quantities; Illumination Entertainment's equation seems heavily weighted toward the latter. There are slapstick moments of Marx Brothers-like contrivance and timing, and silliness dominates. The scene where Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) creates an army of 'boogie robots' (after mishearing 'cookie robots') is a keeper. And Gru's minions - homogenous yellow babblers seemingly designed with a squeezy toy in mind - are so entertaining that they've spawned their own spin-off movie, to be released later this year.The film doesn't quite have the narrative or technical sophistication of Pixar's finest (for me, Monsters Inc. and Wall-E), but it is way more than a wannabe, and considerably funnier than the Ice Age or Madagascar sequels, franchises which are offering diminishing returns. Despicable Me has a humour and a warmth capable of melting through our iciest defences. I hope the sequel can match it.",7,1,2,18 February 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Fails to Rise to the occasion
","Nolan's recent blockbusters stand like looming corporate architecture: shining and cerebral; stately and sexless. His scripts are like visitors' guides to these spaces, proudly explaining every detail, surgically removing every doubt. His tell-don't-show insistence is of an artist possessing consummate technical skill and curiosity, but one unwilling to allow his crafted geometric edges to be rounded off with anything approaching satire or self-effacement. Nolan's style is rigorously formal and conservative, eliding evidence of the author in favour of ruthless aesthetic efficiency. Handsome and functional but lacking personality: Apple iPod films.His sort-of-superhero trilogy began with Batman Begins, an elegant, taut, stirring comic book thriller, in which Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) struggled with his entrenched internal fears, and how to externalise them and use them as a weapon. It was followed by The Dark Knight, which had some fantastic scenes, usually involving the Joker, and maintained a convincing sense of dread up to a point. But it was dogged by hyper-plotting, scattergun characterisation and maddening verbosity - and sadly its successor continues and extends these trends.The third film is set eight years after The Dark Knight, and we meet Wayne as a limping recluse, still suffering physically and emotionally from his sacrifice. The first hour is a spaghetti mass of new characters and reintroduced characters and references to characters, but it's pretty much the same plot as Avengers Assemble, with a bad guy (in this case Bane, played by Tom Hardy) threatening to use a powerful yet unstable energy source as a weapon of mass destruction. Bane was 'born in hell on Earth'. He's built like Lord Humungous from Mad Max 2, his gas mask looks like a Predator mouth, and he speaks like Darth Vader. Not nice. Luckily Batman has help from cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), feisty rookie cop Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and the usual wholesome oldies, Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and Alfred (Michael Caine).There's a great central scene in which Batman is lured to Bane's hideout, and the two go head-to-head, elbow-to-elbow. It's the one satisfying action scene in the film. (There's nothing to rival Begins' monorail showdown or The Dark Knight's truck chase.) Bane is still a seething, menacing presence at this point. All physicality: the embodiment of rage and fearlessness. But soon after he starts speaking at length, and his voice rises and his mystery evaporates, and he becomes just a man, much less than the horrible primeval idea he'd been before. If anyone could have done with a media spokesperson, it's Bane.The film then enters zeitgeist territory, with Bane's army tearing down Wall Street (or whatever the Gotham equivalent might be), nullifying the police presence, and staging the ultimate Occupy protest, while the meek Gotham citizens cower indoors. By this point serious questions about plot logic and group dynamics emerge - a lot of 'How did he end up there?' and 'Why don't they just...?' type enquiries. This is what happens when writers follow every digression their story allows.The Dark Knight Rises isn't a terrible film, but at nearly three hours the content must more compelling than this. I don't mind its neo- conservative messages; the worship of the feted elite is not new to the superhero canon. I can cope with the portentousness. Even Christian Bale's funny Batman voice doesn't bother me. These are all matters of taste. But if we're expected to take this stuff seriously then excessively exposition-heavy screen writing, narrative over-complexity in lieu of profundity, plot chasms, extraneous characterisation, and editorial indiscipline are inexcusable.Remove the cumbersome political overtones and you're left with something disappointingly generic: a doubtful hero (with attachment issues, of course) facing up to a brutish nemesis, a city in peril, and an explosive showdown. So you might as well watch Avengers Assemble again.",4,46,90,21 July 2012
Toy Story 3," Pixar's toy box
","After a slightly slow and perhaps over-familiar opening sequence, Toy Story 3 develops into something more involving and complex than its predecessor - albeit one that lacks the jaw-dropping novelty of the original.Typically, Toy Story 3 doesn't skimp on the grown-up themes: neglect, isolation, as well as growing up itself, of course. There are also bubbling subtexts, like Ned Beatty's Lotso coming across as some kind of manipulative Southern slave-owner, with a patriarchal ferocity born of the trauma of disempowerment. Then there's Jesse (Joan Cusack) - far from being the obedient monogamist of Old Disney, her affections aren't so much torn as shared equally. She was made to love Woody, but why not Buzz too? (Jeez, that's some sentence.) The sophistication doesn't stop there. At one point, the narrative breaks into three strands. And when Buzz breaks into 'Spanish Mode' (one of the film's funniest extended jokes), we're offered another rarity for a mainstream children's film: subtitles.Equally successful - and the real draw for the target audience - is the slapstick. The action in part 3 is a step up from its predecessors. The escape from the sinister Sunnyside kindergarten is worthy of the greatest prison breakout movies. There is a brilliant visual gag involving Mr Potato Head and a pigeon. And finally, the ending feels like Lord of the Rings' Mount Doom, except with a less feathery deus ex machina.There is a sneaking sense of overkill in terms of the sheer wealth of characters. But then for every underdeveloped Mr Pricklepants (Timothy Dalton) there's a hilariously conflicted Ken (Michael Keaton), so it's churlish to complain. And there are some truly weird creations amongst the cast: Chuckles (Bud Luckey) sidesteps the creepy clown cliché to come across as a wellspring of pathos, while Baby, with his superhuman strength and his lazy eye, is probably the most horrifying henchman since Richard Kiel opened his gleaming jaws.Pixar may have made better films during their extraordinary existence; but this film, and the franchise as a whole, will always be their best toy box.",8,2,3,23 July 2010
Trainspotting," Choose the best British film of the nineties
","Director Danny Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge's 1996 adaptation of Irvine Welsh's 1993 debut novel was so central to young British culture at that time that it was always in danger of being forgotten as a mere curio of a bygone Britpop era. Thankfully, good comedy leads a long life, especially the black stuff. In the meanest, wittiest way, Trainspotting said 'bollocks' to Britpop - in fact, it said 'bollocks' to every fad and fashion going - and so it became immortal.Welsh's novel is, like many of his works, essentially a series of short stories bound together by a group of amiable, self-centred protagonists who share a common interest in the procurement of a life-affirming experience - in this case heroin. Unfilmable as such, Boyle and Hodge do an astonishing job of wrapping up a majority of the best Edinburgh tales in a tight 90-minute narrative. The misadventures of Renton (Ewan McGregor), Spud (Ewen Bremner) et al is alluring because their lust for life eclipses their need for skag - the physical enjoyment is never denied, and yet neither is our heroes' desire to see above and beyond the depravity and the mundanity. The film-makers are not simply allowing us to relate to these emaciated thieves - they are necessarily ensuring it.The casting is spot-on. McGregor puts in a signature performance as the amiable Mark Renton; Bremner brings the sensitive Spud hilariously to life; Robert Carlyle is unforgettable as the monstrous Francis Begbie - a man I fear we have all met and to whose jokes we have all felt obliged to laugh. Johnny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, and feature débutant Kelly Macdonald support superbly.What's the point of it all? you might ask. To say its simply about capturing a moment in British pop culture would be to deny the quality of its storytelling. Trainspotting is more than a zeitgeist because, for all its swagger and the brilliance of its soundtrack, it possesses an intricate, multi-taloned narrative navigated by 3D characters, more than one of whom finds his way to an uplifting and hopeful conclusion. Trainspotting is vital.",9,8,11,12 April 2010
Flight," Sometimes soaring
","Robert Zemeckis's first foray into live-action since 2000 is further proof that he is one of the most intelligent mainstream filmmakers working today. He does precisely what popular artists should: render complex themes accessible and entertaining. Like Forrest Gump, Contact and Cast Away, Flight focuses on a single character as an archetype for broader human truths.Denzel Washington plays Whip Whitaker, an airline pilot who gets wasted on booze and coke, goes to work, and then saves a hundred souls from certain death. It's a simple story that unleashes myriad moral and ethical minions into the mind.The plane crash itself is handled with the kind of technical aplomb we've come to expect after Cast Away's memorable opening plunge. Zemeckis enhances the tension and horror by shooting the scene almost entirely from within the plane. 'Oh my God!' cried a member of my audience as the sequence came to an end. It was more apt a reaction than she may have known. As the plane comes down it strikes the spire of a church, and thereon the references to God, faith and redemption are numerous. The mechanical failure that causes the crash is defined as an 'Act of God'. To take this literally would be to say that God willed that the passengers should die. Whip effectively defies the will of God. Therefore, in the eyes of believers, Whip is a sinner not because he was drunk but because he saved those on board. It's a clever dissection of religious moral logic. Washington captures his character exquisitely, paradoxically by not appearing drunk. This is not the acting-out alcoholism of When a Man Loves a Woman, but the type more likely to exist in the real world, of inward-facing lies and outward-facing confidence. There's a telling scene, about two hours in, when Whip makes a booze-fuelled visit to his estranged family. They call him a failure. Dramatically expelled from the house, he finds himself face-to-face with reporters on the doorstep. They call him a hero.For me, the main problem with the film is the distracting sub-plot involving a heroin addict, Nicole (Kelly Reilly). She's something of a cipher, seemingly serving to symbolise the universality of addiction – a laudable idea, but one that also serves to swell the running time. The relationship between Whip and Nicole never fully convinces.Also, the soundtrack is agonisingly literal. The film opens with Barenaked Ladies' 'Alcohol'. We get 'Under the Bridge' by the Chilli Peppers. We get two versions of 'Feelin' Alright'. I mean, you could sketch the narrative just by reading the soundtrack listing. In the end the film slithers into sentimental mulch, as if to compensate for the genuine edginess of some of the earlier scenes (usually involving John Goodman's amusingly amoral Harling Mays). But this final drop-off shouldn't detract too much from what came before: skilfully played, technically outstanding, and morally ambiguous.",7,0,2,11 February 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The pieces are moving...
","Antipodean director Peter Jackson here proves beyond doubt that he's picked up Spielberg's mantle as the director most competent at blending dazzling special effects with convincing emotional drama. The third part of Jackson's opus sees the One Ring return to Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit, while the hordes of Gorgoroth sweep into the realm of man in their tens of thousands. Bad Taste this ain't.This is the boldest of the three movies in that it necessarily must take the most risks in depicting Tolkien's universe. It's a delicate balancing act. For instance, some will love the Jackson of old re-emerging for the Paths of the Dead sequence, while others will resent its Temple of Doom comedy-horror stylings. Legolas skipping up the leg of an olyphaunt and then sliding down its trunk as it falls: fanboys loathe that stuff; the kids love it. But thankfully, due to Return of the King's structure - a series of action scenes built around Gandalf's (Ian McKellen) dreadful narration - one doesn't have to wait long until the next set-piece arrives. And we're spoiled for choice. Gandalf, for example, doesn't only narrate - he also, exhilaratingly, sweeps onto the plain of Pelennor to ward off the Nazgul with a blinding shaft of light. Shelob doesn't disappoint; Weta have created a memorable monster who tickles the neck-hairs of Tolkien devotees and unsuspecting arachnophobics alike (I had not yet read the novel at this point...). And the lighting of the beacons, erupting from far snow-capped peaks, calling to Gondor under the bellowing strains of Howard Shore's aptly triumphant score, might be the single most rousing sequence in movie history. It's the ignition of hope, a glimmer of unbridled joy before the darkness descends.The biggest omission from the novel is the Scouring of the Shire. I happen to agree with the screenwriters' decision. By that time, we've already had two or three endings. We've been stuffed with a veritable feast in the form of the Battle of Pelennor and the Fall of Sauron; the Scouring, I believe, would have been an unwanted dessert. Besides, Tolkien's epilogue was something of a matter of celebrity. Aragorn's final words to the hobbits, as all of Middle Earth kneels, says more about the height of their standing than any Shire-war would.Some minor flaws still remain. Legolas and Gimli's character arcs still reach no real resolution (but then, do we really need another two endings?). The position of the Battle of Pelennor in the story's narrative doesn't really lend itself to the classical Hollywood narrative very comfortably - there's a predictable, albeit only slight, feeling of 'winding down' in all that follows. Also, on this extended DVD, the point at which we are asked to change discs comes at a most inopportune time, as the drums of war are at their peak.But it seems strangely impertinent to sniff out the trilogy's few flaws; to do so is like picking at the hem of the Bayeux Tapestry. Will we ever see such a wholly satisfying series of films again? Not in my lifetime. (N.B. The score is for all three.) This is pure cinema. Jackson and his creative family just don't stop giving. He has successfully translated his love for his source material and created a body of work that will live on and become equally loved. The scope of his achievement is undeniable; as entertainment, this is about as close to perfection as cinema will get.",6,3,5,12 April 2010
Cloud Atlas," Portmanteau poem
","With a tone of told-you-so pomposity, 'folly' is the go-to term used by professional critics with regard to risky big-budget films with disappointing box office returns. Cloud Atlas is no folly. Yes, it is vast in architecture and ambition, but it is also profound and lyrical. I wonder if those journalists who dismiss it as pretentious and/or shallow and focus on mocking its prosthetics shouldn't revisit the idea of what film is for, and remember the art of suspending disbelief in the service of the imagination.David Mitchell's novel (which I've not read) has been adapted for the screen by three writer-directors: Andy and Lana Wachowski, of The Matrix and Bound fame, and Tom Tykwer, most famous for the films Perfume and Run Lola Run. (Like a modern-day John Carpenter, Twyker also worked as composer on Cloud Atlas.) Together they've created a three-hour movie composed of myriad stories spanning different time periods. The actors - Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Ben Wishaw, Jim Broadbent et al - each play different characters throughout these stories, regardless of age, race or gender. It's a conceit that works because it is a film about the connectedness of humanity, and it embraces its own preposterousness with a consistent joviality.At three hours, the film is never dull. In fact, if anything, I felt some sequences could have done with some fleshing out. Perhaps a five- hour director's cut is on the cards. The stories are spliced together, often overlapping in dialogue and incident, and the effect is beguiling yet coherent. A portmanteau film is only as good as its weakest story, and thankfully none of the stories are weak. Even the most generic fable - 'The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing', set upon the high seas of the pre-Thirteenth Amendment Americas - gets its moment, providing the film with its affecting finale.As the stories unfold, one becomes aware that they not only linked by blood but also by theme: the freedom of the individual against the backdrop of the freedom of civilisations. A shambling breakout from an old people's home (with Hugo Weaving as a Nurse Ratched-esque overseer) is offered equal triumph to a hoverbike escape from a 22nd century Neo Seoul in the throes of a fascist lockdown. The secular free will of our species - what some would call a 'human spirit' - transcends time and space and the arbitrary genetic borders it is in our nature to overcome.Cloud Atlas is the kind of rampant, deliriously overreaching cinema whose story is felt as much as it is followed. You'll find flaws abundant (the filmmakers do trample the line between ideas and gimmickry at times), but every one is vanquished by a shot or line or scene that lands perfectly on its feet. Besides, with a tapestry this broad and elegant, it's not about the individual stitches, it's about the dazzling whole.",10,12,20,23 February 2013
Cube," Enjoyment squared
","It was writer-director Vincenzo Natali's entertaining and bizarre Splice that drew my attention to his earlier work, and this is his debut feature: a low-budget Canadian sci-fi set entirely in an enormous cube, containing a series of smaller, room-sized cubes. A group of strangers awaken with no memory of how they became trapped. They need to find a way out - except some rooms are booby-trapped. Tension, conflict and madness ensues.Some have remarked upon the acting quality in the film, although I rather enjoyed the larger-than-life reactions of the characters. The film unashamedly embraces its own B-movie silliness. As the post-Saw horror genre has seemingly become a contest of escalating cruelty and gross-out money shots, a film whose thrills rely on inventive camera angles, imaginative narrative twists, and scarily unpredictable character mood swings seems almost quaint. But it works, thanks to its devotion to the puzzle at its heart and the descending psychology of those trying to solve it.The production design is simple (Natali's team built one cube and changed the wall colour to represent different rooms) and the make-up is effectively gruesome. It's the kind of movie where you'll be constantly questioning character motivations, but surrender to the ride and you'll find yourself enjoying a very neat cult gem.",6,1,2,12 May 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," Outside looking in
","I know nothing about the folk music scene in early 1960s New York, yet I found this film engaging, funny, thought-provoking, and moving. The Coen Brothers can be a bit arch at times, and there are hints of clever-clever in Llewyn's (Oscar Isaac) fraught relationship with Jean (Carey Mulligan), but in the end one is left with the sense of a serious and intelligent story with plenty to say about the nature of the music 'biz' back then and now – the Moebius strip narrative structure is there for a reason.The title character is a struggling musician, recently forced to become a solo act following the suicide of his buddy. Homeless in winter, despondent about his existence yet passionate about his craft, he sofa-hops his way from day to day. He wants to be taken seriously, but no one seems to understand him, inside or outside The Business.The Coens lucked out with their lead man. Isaac is a talented musical performer and a subtle actor. From Barton Fink to The Man Who Wasn't There, the brothers like to throw their ostensibly passive protagonist into a Mad Hatter's Tea Party of a world, and obsess over amusing minutiae whilst alluding to vast themes of fate, integrity, and free will. Here, Llewyn is drawn toward his destiny by a runaway cat called Ulysses. Along the way, we encounter a variety of cameos, from the likes of John Goodman (obviously), F. Murray Abraham, and Justin Timberlake. I had the sense that each represented a different aspect of the essential conflict at the heart of Llewyn's journey: between personal integrity and simply making a living.Crucially, the music is fantastic, and each song – whether a ballad from the man himself, a comedy pop record, or a quartet sea shanty – is given time to play out in full. It never feels like the Coens are sniggering at the perceived quaintness of the period.On the outside, this film has the qualities of a comedy; but it's an absurdist humour which leaves a tragic aftertaste. Don't expect the screwball madcap of Intolerable Cruelty or Burn After Reading. Inside Llewyn Davis is closer in tone to A Serious Man – except this the more accessible film, and probably the brothers' warmest film to date.",8,5,12,3 February 2014
The Nice Guys," A very Shane Black comedy
","Ryan Gosling plays the 'world's worst detective' Holland March, and Russell Crowe is Jackson Healey, a mercenary tough guy who's paid to punch paedophiles.This 1977-set LA story starts with a slightly misjudged visual joke portraying the death of adult movie star named Misty Mountains. When Misty's aunt claims to have seen her niece alive, March is hired to find her. Separately, Healey is hired to stop him by force. A series of convoluted events conspire to bring the mismatched duo together, and off they go on a search for a missing girl named Amelia (Margaret Qualley). There are a ton of bad guys standing in the way of their goal, who happens to be the daughter of a sinister VIP from the Department of Justice (Kim Basinger). It's fair to say that March's and Healey's chaotic quest is propelled as much by luck as skill.Being written and directed by Shane Black, comparisons to Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang and Lethal Weapon are inevitable. It's not quite up to the same standard as those scripts – perhaps future instalments might shed light on Healey's backstory and his neurotic need to be 'useful', or delve more into the broken home life of March – but there is undeniable pleasure in seeing Black do his thing: banter, pathos, idiocy, lunacy, and old school shootouts. It's probably on a par with The Last Boy Scout, which will do nicely.Gosling and Crowe are cast subtly against type, playing around with (and against) their ice cool and wounded warrior personas respectively. It's especially effective with Gosling, whose tendency toward stolidity works well in the more deadpan moments. Angourie Rice, playing March's precocious daughter Holly, almost steals the show from the stars. It's a great performance and a great character: she binds these two emotionally stunted men in the way that Murtaugh's family once brought Riggs back from the brink.The trailers for The Nice Guys have been subtly misleading, presenting the film as a pure knockabout action comedy. Yet Black's skill has always been his ability to combine humour and sincerity. It's refreshing to watch an adult comedy with an intricate (if ridiculous) plot and actual scripted jokes; and one where we're not waiting for the next filmmaker-buddy cameo.The movie has more in common with the slacker detective pictures of the decade in which it's set – it is faintly reminiscent of Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye in its depiction of nihilism and questionable competence. Another touchstone would be Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice, although this is the far less detached and humorous film. Similarly, the period is lovingly reincarnated, in part because it doesn't simply revel in the coolness of the time – here's a movie that's happy to eschew the disco and observe the rubbish brownness of late-70s social decline.The Nice Guys is a welcome return of one of cinema's most reliable and intelligent mainstream filmmakers. Shane Black is a master of toying with genre (he was responsible for Iron Man 3's bonkers twist); and although the buddy genre may be a familiar one, it remains the perfect vehicle for his talents.Arguably the worst impulse of the modern action movie is excess, and the curse of the modern American comedy is irony. The Nice Guys offers mercifully little of either, which makes it feel both old and new.",7,2,5,27 May 2016
Warcraft," Wow
","It's the best video game adaptation ever made! Although, let's face it, this is faint praise. More importantly – and I suspect this was director Duncan Jones's mission statement – it's a good film. Not perfect, but better than the wham bam trailers would have us expect, and nothing like those Rotten Tomatoes numbers. Most will have heard of World of Warcraft, the western world's most successful massively multiplayer online roleplaying game. Although Jones's movie actually returns to 1994, to the original game, Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, as its starting point. So, do I review this adaptation as a layman or a fan? I fall somewhere in-between: I've played Warcraft 3 and vanilla WoW, but then my knowledge falls away. Still, I know a Murloc warble when I hear it, and I understand the significance of the name Durotan. Durotan (Toby Kebbell) is an orc chief of the Frostwolf Clan. His homeworld Draenor is dying, and his leader, Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), is farming the souls of the indigenous Draenei in order to create a portal to Azeroth, where he intends to migrate his Horde and settle in the new world. Trouble is, Azeroth is already home to humankind (and elves and other species we briefly glimpse).The human military force in Azeroth is led by Lothar (Travis Fimmel), a powerful warrior who joins forces with the mage named Medivh (Ben Foster) and mage-apprentice Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) to fight the Horde and close the portal. But Durotan is equally sceptical about Gul'dan's crusade, and he is seeking to halt the mighty warlock via orcish mutiny. When the humans capture the half- orc Garona (Paula Patton), she becomes the bridge between Lothar and Durotan. But will it be enough to prevent Gul'dan from completing his apocalyptic plan?The themes are broad and basic but laudable. Displaced people from a dying land escaping to a new place and a new culture? There are obvious parallels with modern migration struggles. But Jones targets a more nuanced dramatic core, focusing upon those individuals seeking common ground – who happen to be the proudest and arguably truest of each tribe. There's a hint of The Hobbit in the bright-but-grounded style of the movie. But the similarity ends there, because while Peter Jackson stretched a lot of content thinly across nearly nine hours, Jones and his co-writers pack more significant incident into two. I also feel that Jones has done a better job of integrating practical sets and props with CG environments. The special effects are something special, particularly during the orc scenes. I haven't seen such weight and clarity in CGI since Pacific Rim. While Warcraft doesn't seek to mimic the games' almost cartoony aesthetic it is evidently a work of great care and affection for the larger-than-life source material. On the performance front, Fimmel essentially reprises his roguish Vikings role as the charismatic Lothar. Patton's Garona plays a key part as the go-between for the clashing factions. I especially enjoyed her non-nonsense attitude to mating. Gul'dan is a wonderfully grotesque creation whose Fel power has left him utterly indifferent to the plight of the common man. There's a fantastically 12A-pushing scene in which he idly sucks the soul from a human captive like he's toking on a crack pipe. But it's Kebbell who steals the show. He lives and breathes the hulking Durotan – with this role and Apes' Koba, I wonder if we have a successor to Andy Serkis in the motion capture maestro stakes. The focus on characters and by extension themes is what elevates Warcraft above standard fantasy fare. Even when, in the final battle, the intimate drama threatens to be swamped by spectacle, Jones has the sense to give us emotional beats: pay-offs for the patient character-building of the first two acts. Warcraft has been hugely underrated by professional critics so far. The temptation is to rally against this perceived injustice. But let's reach for some objectivity: Warcraft is a flawed film. There's some seriously clunky dialogue, as per the need for exposition in a fantasy universe that will be all-new to many in the audience. And a sub- plot about Lothar's son never really resonates, perhaps because there are so many characters vying for real estate in the relatively brief running time. Warcraft's chief flaw may be its subtitle. It means we're left with a dangerously inconclusive ending. How much it's possible to enjoy the final act of this film depends largely on whether 'The Beginning' is suitably confident or hopelessly optimistic. Knock off a star if your interest in Warcraft doesn't extend beyond one particularly amusing South Park episode – you're still in for a solid, enjoyable adventure story, somewhat old-fashioned in tone; and which also, in an era of turgid monstrosities, feels unusually brisk. For the fans, this is a no-brainer which happens to have some brains to go with its brawn.",7,2,3,8 June 2016
Contact," Profoundly affecting
","Zemeckis' finest film has everything a mainstream move should have: brains, beauty, and a little bit of stardust.The transcendentally brilliant Jodie Foster puts in a great performance as Ellie Arroway, a wide-eyed little girl in a woman's body. In Foster's Ellie, we see all the failed college relationships described in Carl Sagan's novel.After the death of her father (David Morse), Ellie becomes a star-gazer, convinced there can be no God. It's a simple, convincing, and rather moving set up, always propelling the story, even when the big themes rear their head. In, say, Spielberg's hands, this emotional core might have become cloying. But director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriters James V Hart and Michael Goldenberg tell the story almost entirely from the point of view of a heroine who is essentially an innocent in a world of cynical agendas. So when Ellie takes her voyage, those downplayed final scenes feel true, not mawkish.There are subtleties here which enrich the experience. Ellie is eventually blessed with her opportunity by the benign, paternal Hadden (John Hurt), who - unlike her own father - is able to cheat death. Also, why does Ellie not share Palmer's (Matthew McConaughey) fear of death? She purports to hold no fear of God; and yet, deep down, doesn't she truly wish to join her father, wherever he might be... in Heaven, perhaps? Like all good science fiction, Contact reinforces our faith. Faith, that is, in each other.",9,2,4,12 April 2010
The Great Gatsby," A dizzying dance, dramatically dead
","It's disconcerting to see an actor working at a different level to those around him, but that's what's happening in Baz Luhrman's shiny plastic adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's seminal novel. Leonardo Di Caprio's performance in the title role is one of range, detail, and pure star power - but Luhrman isn't able to up his game to match it. The director's trademark restless camera movement and hack 'n' slash editing works well for a while, when the party's in full swing. Fast forward two hours and the drama surrounding the maelstrom at the film's centre is inert.This is a tragedy of the human condition filmed as a overwrought teenage love story. A love story depends on its central pairing, but the partnership between Daisy (Carey Mulligan, too often recalling her performance in Steve McQueen's Shame) and Gatsby never convinces - we're told of their love but it is never apparent, in reality, memory, or fantasy.There are some fantastic individual scenes, pick of which would be Gatsby's ostentatious teatime reunion with Daisy. And as one would expect the party setups suitably capture the lust and excess of the period, with anachronistic rhythms from Jay-Z, which complement and aggravate in equal measure. But in the end the film failed to engage me on an emotional level, through no fault of the lead actor. This is a pity because it's a story that will, sadly, never not be relevant.",5,3,7,28 May 2013
Beetlejuice," Black pantomime
","After the sugary fun of Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Burton made this ingenious and witty horror comedy. Bristling with imagination, it brilliantly showcases the visual style that Burton would come to call his own with comic-Gothic productions like Batman, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman Returns.Adam (Alex Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) play the recently deceased homeowners who are desperate to haunt yuppie couple Delia (Catherine O'Hara) and Charles (Jeffrey Jones) off their property. Adam and Barbara find a useful ally in depressive goth kid Lydia (Winona Ryder), before the titular 'Betelgeuse' (Michael Keaton) throws a spanner in the works.It's a pity the film has been granted a 15 certificate in the UK, because there's plenty here for kids to enjoy. Adam and Barbara's complete acceptance of their predicament (namely being dead) is a conceit usually reserved for children's films, and their ensuing antics play out like a kind of ghoulish Home Alone. But then Keaton's vile, swearing, swaggering Beetlejuice steps into shot. It's a hilarious performance, perhaps one that Jim Carrey might have a go at these days; and yet I doubt Carrey would be able to create such a magnificently obnoxious hick.The production design and make-up is fantastic. The purgatory-style waiting room scenes, with all their shark attack victims and shrunken heads, perfectly house Burton's love for pantomime black humour. Some of the 'bigger' special effects, particularly in the desert netherworld that awaits Adam and Barbara outside their front door, look dated. But hey, no amount of CGI will look this charming after 20 years.",6,1,5,12 April 2010
The Fighter," Between Rocky and a hard place
","The quote on one poster for David 'Three Kings' O Russell's spirited, hackneyed boxing biopic proclaims it to be the best since Rocky. I guess it's best not to remind folks of Martin Scorsese's magisterial masterpiece, lest audiences stay home and turn on the DVD player instead.Mark Wahlberg plays Micky Ward, the rough, rising star from the malnourished streets of Massachusetts. Christian Bale plays his half-brother and trainer, Dicky, a falling star who once tripped up Sugar Ray Leonard in the ring. They're surrounded by women: Micky's monstrous mother-cum-manager, Alice (Melissa Leo), a thousand ugly sisters, and no-nonsense girl-next-door Charlene (Amy Adams). Arguments ensue - fickle feuds and anguished hugs - and we even get some boxing toward the end.It comes across as the wonky-nosed, crackhead triplet of The King's Speech and 127 Hours, insofar as it is an almost feverishly inspiring, consoling film born out of hard times. Except the performances here are relatively one-dimensional. And the script, credited to four writers, comes disconcertingly to life as a bizarre Frankenstein creation - sometimes a family farce, sometimes a sports drama cliché checklist, sometimes a maudlin forgive-a-thon under afternoon porches - and excels at nothing.As for the boxing scenes... Flat. Cursory. Russell just doesn't seem altogether interested. Which, in the final moment, is no surprise. A formula fighting film will always end with a ruckus - yet by that point all the conflict within the family has been defused. The writers attempt to surgically implant some drama into the climactic battle by having Dicky give one last stirring speech. But it's hard to soar on the zephyr of an afterthought.There are some good individual scenes in The Fighter, especially early on. The introduction to the half-brothers has them bouncing through Lowell, inhabiting their time and place, while the camera spins and glides. The aforementioned sisters provide some amusement as a chorus of permanent disdain. In fact, while the film sustains its first-third burlesque tone, it's fun. And there is definite pleasure in watching Bale return to the feral grandstanding with which he made his name prior to the constraints of Bruce Wayne.The Fighter ticks a lot of boxes - too many. The result isn't a disaster, but nor is it Best Picture.",5,4,9,25 February 2011
