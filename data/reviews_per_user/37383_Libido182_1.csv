Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," had some bad parts but worth seeing
",Overall i feel this movie is worth seeing but it has some corny parts to it that make it not as good as the original.  There is the whole fact that you know Anakin skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi can't die takes away when they try to make it look like they could die.  Darth Maul was major kewl yet lucas only gave him a small part which wasn't cool at all.  The alien race that helps to protect Nabio were annoying since you could tell they were computer animated.  Then the whole fact that Anakin was able to fly the plane so well was corny also.  I would go see it in theatres but don't expect too much out of it,7,0,0,30 May 1999
