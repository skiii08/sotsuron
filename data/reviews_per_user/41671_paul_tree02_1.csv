The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," So terribly boring my sister began FARTING to entertain herself.
","SO TERRIBLY BORING MY SISTER BEGAN FARTING TO ENTERTAIN HERSELF I PROMISE YOU'LL FEEL FOOLISH FOR WATCHING. YOU WILL HAVE MISSED NOTHING. Life is far too short to waste your time watching this movie.I'm only writing the further because IMDb required a minimum of 10 lines.This movie is nothing remotely similar to the first two movies. The worse of all sequels in a series. It consists of long drawn out rants will literally almost nothing being said or done in the entire movie. 2 HOURS OF REPEATED NON-SENSE AND DRONING. I mean this honestly, acknowledging it might sound extreme; this was the worst film I've ever seen.",1,30,45,29 November 2014
