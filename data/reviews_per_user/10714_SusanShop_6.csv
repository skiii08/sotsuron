Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Go see it
","I'm not a Fantasy or Horror movie goer, but the idea of Abraham Lincoln fighting vampires was too interesting a juxtaposition to resist. I am so glad I went - loved all the actors in their roles, found myself laughing at the machinations of the vampires. Steampunkers should enjoy some of the gadgets. Seriously though, the opening scene rolling back from modern Washington to the city of the 1800's set a wonderful tone for the remainder of the story. This being the sesquicentennial of the American Civil War - being able to present a history lesson in such an entertaining fashion - kudos to Seth Grahame-Smith for doing such a clever job. Absolutely good fun !!!",8,3,6,3 July 2012
Argo," History without the dryness
","As a Canadian with strong American ties, and being around when Ambassador Ken Taylor took in the American embassy staff who escaped the over-running of their embassy in Iran, I found the movie Argo to be very interesting when told from an American perspective ! As a movie, it is worthy of Oscar nods, and any other nominations it receives. Ben Affleck did a great job making this movie. Even though I knew the 6 American would get out safely, the process was a nail biter. Definitely one to go see. It seems to me that Ken Taylor wrote about the incident, and I am going to have to read his account. I wasn't aware of the Mendes book, so shall likely read it as well.I'm sure both accounts will be like the story about the 6 blind men who were asked to describe the elephant....each perspective is different and unique!!",Null,0,1,18 December 2012
Midnight in Paris," Paris - city of love
","I have never been a fan of Woody Allen or his films, BUT Midnight in Paris was so amazing!! Paris is wonderful, the characters are wonderful, the lessons learned are wonderful probably because of their simplicity, and their in your face common sense. The 1920's in Paris was a highlight of that city's history, although Allen presents history in the most delightful way possible. The only point I found jarring was seeing French women wearing blue jeans in public. That was a new one for me, as all the French women I have ever seen, even the ones working in small shops, dress. The blue jeans had to have been some sort of attempt to make the film palatable to Americans. I am going to go see the film a 2nd time.",8,1,2,20 June 2011
Black Mass," Biopic of one of Boston's most notorious criminals
","Loved this movie. I was concerned that 'Hollywood' might have over- dramatized the events and the people involved, but they did not. After a bit of background checking on my part, I would have to say that if anything, Hollywood likely did not include all the gory details of Jimmy Bulger's life and crime spree !! This is also no 'glorification' of any of the events that occurred, just a straight forward detailing of crime and corruption in Boston in the 70's and 80's. Johnny Depp is almost unrecognizable - so I suspect Oscar will be looking for him !! Benedict Cumberbatch does a great turn as a Senator and politico. If there is one character in the story I would feel sorry for, it is John Connolly, the FBI agent who uses his old school connections with the Bulgers to feather his own nest !! He should have known that crime doesn't pay, and the bad guys always get caught - maybe not right away - but they always get caught !!",9,2,11,18 September 2015
Hugo," Possible spoiler alert
","The trailer for Hugo was intriguing, and I expected to see an engaging adventure between 2 children and the automaton. That did indeed occur - but even better was the factor of the silent films. Earlier this year I began studying the history of film making, and that means the silent film era. When Hugo took Isabel to the silent film, my level of interest picked up. Then as the story of George came into play, I fell in love. Suddenly the story went from something nice to something so wonderful. The setting in the Paris train station,and the characters were also wonderful, and I think it must have made for some tricky editing decisions as to how much of those stories to portray. I recommend this film for anyone who delights in being whisked into a world of enchantment.",8,0,1,18 December 2011
The Artist," Brilliant movie making
","I have read that in 1895 the art of movie making began, allbeit in black and white and silent. It would be another 25-30 years until the second half of the 1920's before the innovations of Technicolour and sound would change how movies were made! Many of the actors in Hollywood were new immigrants, and dialogue coaches had not been invented yet, so when silents became talkies, many previously successful film careers were over. The European accents didn't translate so well. The Artist asks the question - how does one make that transition from silent to talkie? And then proceeds to answer using the silent/black and white techniques of those first pictures...absolutely brilliantly !! This afternoon I drove 2 1/2 hours (each way) to see The Artist at the Montreal World Film Festival. Being a fan of the silent film genre, I was watching for nods to those first stars of the silver screen. Some were obvious and some were more subtle.I want to talk about the picture so much, but don't want to give anything away. LOVED THE FILM - I may have to make it to the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in September to see The Artist again !!It's worth the trip !!!",Null,111,162,20 August 2011
