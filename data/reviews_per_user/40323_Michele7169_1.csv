First Man," Once again..leftist agenda
","How disappointing this movie was! The book tells the story of a great American hero who joined the military and obsessed with flight. He did everything he could to become a great pilot and become an Astronaut. This movie however bores you to death by leaving out most important details of his plight and focusing on his weaknesses. We saw wayyyy to much vomiting and they did not even show the success they had of learning to orbit! Why? Because the LEFT is busy pushing their 'all men are awful ' agenda! In the last 4 yrs you could not go to a movie,watch an awards show or even listen to music without having the lefts politics shoved down your throat. This was no exception. Don't waste your time on this. It did NOT tell the real story.lit bores you to tears leaving out the excitement of AMERICAN achievements.",1,9,19,10 January 2019
