The Devil's Advocate," A postmodern morality tale for our time.
","This film is not as trashy as the trailer made it out to be.  In fact, it is quite thought-provoking in many ways -- particularly regarding the way the legal system operates in the United States.  Besides, it offers a moral lesson that teaches regular folks the danger of egoism quite effectively.",10,1,1,20 July 1999
Citizen Kane," A great synthesis of form and content.
",Citizen Kane is the great American film that manifests the strength as well as the malaise of the American ideal.  This is the first film that synthesized the dazzling film techniques and the significant story-line seamlessly.  A masterpiece!,10,1,3,20 July 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The funniest yet the most frightening satire on the gung-ho masculinity.
","It was very refreshing to see some aspects of masculinity satirized so mercilessly by a male film-maker.  This film is in one sense very contextualized by the political milieu of a particular time: we would never be able to feel the realness of the threat of nuclear holocaust of the time when the film was made.  Nevertheless, its satirical thrust is still felt strongly.By the way, why does the initial shots of the air-borne fuel-refilling scene seem more erotic than the sex orgy sequence of Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut?",10,2,3,20 July 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," A true cinematic masterpiece!
","When I first saw this film I was just a little school girl.  Still I could feel the crashing loneliness of this self-made hero, T. E. Lawrence.  In fact, I did cry for him.  An unforgettable film!",10,0,2,20 July 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," A great visionary film!
",For once Kubrick expresses somewhat grandiose but ultimately optimistic view of humanity.  Perhaps he was truly inspired by the success of the U.S. space program of the '60s.  I cannot forget the beginning and ending shots of this film.,10,1,3,20 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," This film is definitely not a masterpiece.
","I was very disappointed in Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut, -- perhaps because I was a great admirer of Kubrick's films such as 2001: Space Odyssey and Dr. Strangelove.  The symbolism in the film was too obvious to be thought-provoking, and Kubrick's attitude toward the material was puerile and  puritanical at the same time, generating a sense of cognitive dissonance.  As the initial shot of the film as well as the deployment of the movie-star couple  indicates, the director at first seems to underline the voyeurism of the film medium, audience as well as of himself.  Well, however, as the film progresses, his critical stance toward the film medium disintegrates into his somewhat childish fascination  with the 'beauty' of the nude female bodies in the Hollywood film industry(all of which reminded me of the naked mannequin beverage dispensers in A Clockwork Orange), which is nevertheless hidden under the facade of a stern moralist.  It is a sexist film, indeed.  (Well, which of Kubrick's films were not sexist?) However, the most disturbing aspect of this film event (what else can you call it?) to me was many critics' response toward this film: some of them even called this minor incomplete film as a masterpiece.  Their awe of this outstanding film-maker obviously pulled a blind over their eyes.  Eyes wide shut can be described as the condition of these critics whose inferiority complex makes them intellectual coward of themselves.  As a recent, more thought-provoking film hinted at, we are in a matrix-like system that has been created and controlled by the media. These unthinking critics are the ample evidence of this false-reality-creating machine.",5,1,3,20 July 1999
The Matrix," The matrix is a metaphor.
","The matrix is what it is as presented in the film.  But, it is also a metaphor for many things that make us unable to see reality as it is, such as media, stereotypes,  and culture.  This film epitomizes what is best in our popular culture. A great job!",10,0,0,20 July 1999
The Thin Red Line," A poetic meditation on war.
","I found this film quite thought-provoking.  Since the film seems to accept the war as a part of natural cycle, it may not work exactly as an anti-war film.  However, it is profoundly moving.",10,1,2,20 July 1999
