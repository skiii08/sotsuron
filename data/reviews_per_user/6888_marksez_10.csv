First Man," Almost Half Good. It's No Apollo 13
","It's a Hollywood formula movie.The sad scenes are punctuated with obligatory Hollywood rain (while the sun is shining).Armstrong's wife is shown as emotionally burdened and burdensome. Her husband is an astronaut, and she's upset he may not come back from the moon. Didn't she know he was in a dangerous job?The Earth scenes were drawn out, slow, and emotionally heavy.The space scenes are pretty well done.The humanity of the characters is lost in the overly dramatic story telling. The movie lacks reality and believability.It's too heavy and slow. It could have been so much better.I know there was comraderie among the astronauts. That's barely suggested in this movie.It's no Apollo 13.",3,0,1,18 May 2019
Gravity," This IS a GOOD Movie
","I watched this movie Saturday night while I was home alone. I watched it on my 70 inch HDTV with a Sony sound system and on Blu-ray. It was excellent. The CGI is wonderful, and the suspense and storytelling is very well done. I was willing to look past some of the unreal unscience for the sake of the story. I doubt that many astronauts wear only their sexy underwear inside their spacesuits. Why would Sandra take off her space suit inside the space station, not knowing the amount of damage she would encounter once inside? Could someone accidentally start a catastrophic fire in the ISS just by accidentally brushing by something? No matter, the story was all good. I saw a brief cut from Mission to Mars from 2000 and darn if there isn't the exact same scene of the man telling the woman to let him go to save herself. Still it's all good stuff. We can forgive some of the hokey stuff and unlikely or even unpossible stuff in exchange for good entertainment. It is a movie, after all. If you want reality, go outside.",Null,2,4,14 April 2014
Aquaman," This is an excellent escape from reality movie
","We saw an advance preview, and I thought this movie was great. It's the same lame every action movie story stuck inside some great special effects, GGI, clever wrting and terrific movie sets.It's fun to watch. If you're going to see this movie, leave your critical thinking at the door. Grab a big bucket of pop corn and a large drink, turn off your thoughts, and enjoy the action, story, cool action, and great writing.",9,8,17,19 December 2018
Gettysburg," Well Told History Not So Good A Movie
","I have tried many times over the years to watch this movie in its entirety. It is so not well done in some spots that I find that difficult to do.I do like the accuracy of its history and attempts to recreate the historical dialogue. The story telling quality is pulled down by the gadawful syrupy music and stiff acting. Poor Robert E. Lee must have spun around in his grave several times when he saw Martin Sheen's portrayal of him.This movie is good actors acting badlyâ€”----for a movie. The script would have worked well as a stage production. For a movie that wanted (I suppose) to give us a sense of realism, this reaaaaallly hits the stinky mark.Bad beards, yes for certain. They look glued on.The bad acting by the extras in the battle scenes is too noticeable.This is no 'Saving Private Ryan' in its story telling. It could have been, and it would have been good movie stuff.I love good history movies, so I enjoy that aspect of this one. I wish they'd gotten a better director.",4,1,5,1 July 2011
Life of Pi," This is a Really, Really Good Movie, Really
","This is a spectacular movie, and those are rare these days.How could anyone not like this movie and its story? The special effects are almost seamless and the fitting together of 'real' moments and moments that must be fantasy (the lake-like calm clear ocean in a dreamlike sequence, the floating island, as examples).So, it borrows a bit from 'Castaway' with the storm, the sinking vessel, the whale, landing on an island, to name a few examples, it still holds our attention throughout and does everything else superbly.And of course the zinger is the twist at the end when we learn that the entire story we just watched may be a metaphor for what really happened, and we are given the choice of which story to choose. That's a nice bit of Twilight Zoniness that adds a great touch.I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I knew it had gotten a lot of good press, but that is no guarantee of a good movie. This one earns all of the good stuff people say about it.",10,5,10,28 April 2013
Interstellar," This Movie Steals from Everywhere
","So many movies are just a rehash of other movies. The many plots are dropped into a Hollywood blender and the writers make a movie of out whatever comes out. That said, for this movie, the writers did a great job. Sure Albert Einstein, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C.Clark and other great scientists and science fiction writers are rolling their eyes in disgust and amazement at a movie that plays fast and loose with science and physics. Still, if you're willing to put all expectations of believability aside, this is really good entertainment.The movie has some of the best actors, good acting, good writing and really nice special effects. If your goal is to be entertained with a good story, music and special effects, this is movie worth seeing.",10,0,3,4 January 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," It takes you somewhere other than where you expected it to go
","I watched this movie on the airplane flight home last night. Early into the movie I was ready to switch to something else. I decided to stick with it for a bit longer, and it turned out to be a worthwhile decision. This movie takes you on a trip. The story is not about the three billboards or the death of Mildred's daughter. It's a story that's a mini life story about each of its key characters, Willoughby, Dixon, James the dwarf, and even the supporting characters. The tone makes me think of Breaking Bad or Boardwalk Empire. The big story is just a frame to insert the personal stories into. It's like binge watching a Netflix series all in one movie. By the end, you feel like you've come to know and understand the people, who in the beginning of the movie seemed like strange, mean, hateful people.It's a great movie because, like most great movies, it breaks with expectations and takes you somewhere other than where you thought it would go.",9,2,4,24 March 2018
Bridge of Spies," Good Entertainment if You Don't Need Historical Accuracy or Reality
","We enjoyed this movie on a purely entertainment level. If you don't have to have historical accuracy and logic, this will do for that.The movie is filled with mucho movie clichés, for example, a dark stormy, rainy night to set the anxious scene for the shady CIA agent following Tom Hanks, cold blizzardy snow to set the East Germany post war gloom and danger, mean/cold/evil CIA agents, a judge that doesn't care about following proper legal proceedings, WW II era German soldiers, cold and calculating Soviets, 1950's innocence in America, Commie hating Americans, unquestioning allegiance to the Military, and of course everything has to be based on a time deadline and come down to a happy ending at the last moment.The first part of the movie made me uncomfortable because of its historical inaccuracy and exaggerations. Once I stopped looking for accuracy and reality as necessities, I settled down to just being entertained. Gary Powers clinging to his spinning out of control U-2 was both exciting and silly. A person attached to an out of control airplane that was falling at +400 mph would be torn apart. I believe the historically accurate story was less exciting. Gary Powers ejected after his plane was hit, failed to destroy the aircraft and take his suicide pill, and was captured, to the embarrassment of the U.S.The movie takes a long time to move through the story that we know has to have a happy ending. It's filled with almost there, then failure, then almost there again. That's the main pattern of the telling.Tom Hanks is always Tom Hanks, no matter who he plays these days. He's no longer the intense actor we saw in 'Big', 'Forrest Gump', 'Cast Away', or his other blockbuster masterpieces. The overall theme of the story was a good one. Spying was considered a necessary part of the Cold War, and both sides denying that they were spying was part of the game.History loses something in the telling.",6,0,2,16 January 2017
Zero Dark Thirty," Bogus, Phony and Ludicrous
","How bad is this movie? Let me count the ways.It's a stupid movie, and the story is bogus, phony, and ludicrously told.It's doubtful that one 30 year old, attractive woman was almost solely responsible for finding Bin Laden. This version of the 'truth' is an insult to those people who really did the work and made the sacrifices to accomplish this extraordinary mission. The soldiers who went on this mission did not walk away from a game of horseshoes, hop on some helicopters and fly off to their mission. They trained extensively for this mission. That truth was lost in this story telling.It's nice to see an attractive woman, but this movie poses our heroine in a tight t-shirt and tight jeans, standing in interesting stances and acting unpleasantly. I'll buy that if you want to make this a 'Rocky' fiction movie, but don't try to sell it as a true story. That's bad stuff.The movie moves too sloooooooooow. The scene of the hanger doors opening to reveal the helicopters is deliberately slow for effect, but the real effect is, 'Okay, we get it, the door is opening.' The whole movie is a story told in slow motion.As many of the other reviews say, it's an amazement that this movie got good reviews from anyone. Money and pictures of someone must have been involved. It does not deserve anything close to a good rating.The attack scene is the best part, and is well done. The movie should have been about the truth and not about showing off a fictitious sexy woman whose power comes from her ability to use the 'f' word with her superiors.",4,7,13,23 June 2013
Her," IF you like Romantic stories, THEN you will love this movie. IF not, THEN not
","This is not my kind of movie, but I liked it anyway. The story has so many different messages intertwined in it; our relationships are all in our own minds, all relationships have a life cycle from beginning to end, technology is allowing us live in our own heads and personal world instead of reaching out to others, mostly, we can only control our own side of a relationship, and sometimes not even that, our relationships are defined largely as reflections of ourselves, and many other messages. This story seemed to have a bit of a Woody Allen-bizarre flavor to it, without the comedy. If you're a romantic, or in a romantic soul searching mood, this movie can be pleasant and insightful. I like that the characters are a lot like real people, which is not a quality found in many movies. Of course, there is a dramatic slant added to the personalities to make the story telling work, still it's content most people can identify with.It's not a shoot'em up action movie, and it has no monsters or evil villains, so people who like those kinds of movies will not like this. Still it is a movie that many men and women can find themes to connect with.",7,0,2,27 July 2014
