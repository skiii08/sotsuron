Hereditary," Creepy Atmosphere and Great Camera Work with a Few Hiccups
","Toni Colette delivers an amazing performance in this creepy horror film. I did not find it scary, as I don't find many films to be scary, but I appreciated that it avoided the traps so many horror movies these days fall into, namely jump scares. Milly Shapiro was also outstanding, and deserved more screen time. I have never been a fan of Alex Wolff and his acting in this film has not changed that. The ending is also iffy and there a few goofy scenes that I chuckled at. Over all pretty great.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 8/10

Akira," A look at a Beautifully Ugly Future
","Akira is an intense thrill ride that is both gorgeous and revolting. The world of Akira is depressing, it is bleak and it is unforgiving. It is hard to define the experience. Recommended.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 8/10

Deadpool 2," More Fun Sexy Times with Deadpool
","A fun action comedy that sees Deadpool still being Deadpool only this time with a better supporting cast and a breakout star in Domino. Better than the original in my opinion. Still silly and has some strange pacing issues but good overall.Personal Enjoyment Score(IMDb): 7/10

Ready Player One," Anime, Video Games, Comic Books, Cartoons oh my! No one is safe.
","A poorly envisioned world made up of nostalgia and references. If you aren't blinded by these you'll see how shallow and ridiculous much of this movie is. It constantly misses the point, and everyone is stupid. Also the whole club fight scene. No thanks.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 3/10

"I, Tonya"," Its Like this Film was Made for Me
","Everything about this film hits a cord with me, there is almost nothing I dislike about it. This may even be one of my favourite films of all time, I'll just have to rewatch it to make sure. Funny, emotional and full of spunk. Highly recommended.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 10/10

Alien," One of my Favourite Films. Truly Outstanding.
","Ripley is one of the greatest heroines in film history. Alien is a slow burn that some may find boring, however it builds the suspense and lets you learn more about the characters. The camera work, sound design and set are all greatly crafted and deliberate. While a different genre Alien is equally as good and enjoyable as Aliens in my opinion.#2 on my top 10 Films of all time.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 10/10

Ant-Man," Comedy and Family Values truly Shine in this Superhero Flick
","An enjoyable romp about one of my least favourite Super Heroes. Paul Rudd really brings out some of the best laughs the MCU has to offer. We need more of this.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 8/10
Movie Score (LetterBoxd): 6/10",8,0,1,29 August 2018
Aliens," Epic Return of Ripley but this time With More Guns and Newts
","Ripley returns in this film, however this time things take a different turn. Deviating a bit from the Horror/Thriller aspects of the original Aliens is an action-packed Sci-Fi with heart. Once again everything is meticulous and deliberate, creating a near perfect film. Newt is one of the best, if not the best, kids in film history. She also speaks one of my favourite lines. Director's Cut/Special Edition recommended as the Theatrical release is not as well crafted and loses some of its depth.#2 on my list of top 10 Films of all time.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDB): 10/10

Avengers: Infinity War," A Comic Booky Romp with a Ton of Characters
","The is one of the best movies in the MCU line up, based purely on a storytelling and action. The villain(s) are great and the visuals are astounding. However on a personal level I lost a lot of enjoyment based solely on who was more of a main character than who. A lot of the characters I find annoying or boring had more time to do things in this movie than those I enjoy. Also Ebony Maw was dispatched too quickly. Movie loses its appeal the more time passes.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 6/10
Movie Score (LetterBoxd): 7/10",6,0,2,30 August 2018
Drive," Deeply Emotional and Poignant
","Drive is a slow burn action flick that focuses more on the main character's social anxiety and the difficulties in the life he has chosen. With an insane third act this film surprises you from beginning to end. I never found it boring and the soundtrack fits every scene. A Real Hero is an amazing song choice, adding so much more meaning to every scene.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 10/10
Movie Score (LetterBoxd): 9/10",10,0,1,31 August 2018
The Incredibles," One of the Best Superhero and Pixar Movies
","The Incredibles is a great movie about a family of superheroes. Edna Mode is the breakout star though every character is great. Recommended for everyone.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 10/10

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Anywhere, Anytime.
","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is action-packed, bloody, cheesy, hectic and nonsensical. And I love every single second of it. I can't exactly pinpoint what exactly it is but Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a Film I can watch anytime, anywhere. Everyone is great in this, the camera shots and filters are perfect, the action is outrageous and every scene is finely crafted. The soundtrack elevates an already amazing film into a level all its own. My favourite film of all time.#1 on MY list of top 10 films of all time.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 10/10

2001: A Space Odyssey," The Most Terrifying Film I've ever Seen
","The first time I ever saw this Film was in IMAX (August 2018). The pure amount of anxiety, terror and awe this film evokes is unreal and otherworldly. If not for my partner I would have left the theater during the final chapter as it was sensory overload and I shed tears due to how overcome I was. It was not only the music, but the sheer size of it all, and the loneliness and vast emptiness of space that completely consumed me. I was afraid. It was one of the greatest things that I have ever experienced in my life.",10,1,1,31 August 2018
The Shape of Water," Enjoyably Quirky and Beautiful
","While there are a couple things I did not like in this Film (namely the Villain) there is much here that is good. The Shape of Water reminds us that communication without words is possible, and many times words will just mess everything up. The use of water in this film, from the pool to the rain and the cleaning there is much that is said through the visuals alone. Definitely not for everyone.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 8/10

The Witch," Madness and Cruelty: The Life of a Pilgrim
","The Witch is a deep, dark pit of dispair and torture for the family we follow. I thoroughly enjoyed The Witcher, though I never found that I was scared or terrified it was never boring.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 7/10

Deadpool," Adult Fun with a bit of Heart
","One of the best 'Superhero' films to date. Mainly due to the humour and how much fun you can tell the actors were having. A fun romp that drags on near the end but recommended for those who are a fan of comics or Deadpool.Personal Enjoyment Score(IMDb): 7/10

Incredibles 2," Edna Mode Shines while the Family Loses itself
","Edna is the only one really holding their own here. Still a fun movie but no where near as good as the original. Mr. Incredible is a huge ass in this while Elastigirl starts to grow as a separate character beyond her family. Violet is miserable while Dash is annoying. Not bad, but not at all great.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 7/10

The Social Network," I Feel the Same Way about This Move as I do about FaceBook
","An admittedly great film that I found both annoying and boring. I have never been a fan of Jesse Eisenberg or Mark Zuckerberg. I tried really hard to enjoy this but I just could bring myself to. Still, there are a lot of great scenes.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 3/10

The Simpsons Movie," A Good, Extra Long, Episode of the Simpsons
","Basically a long episode of the Simpsons. Not bad, and pretty decent for what it is. That being The Simpsons. I've seen it a few times. It loses some of its humour on rewatches but is very much like a mid 2000's episode of the Simpsons.Personal Enjoyment Score(IMDb): 8/10
