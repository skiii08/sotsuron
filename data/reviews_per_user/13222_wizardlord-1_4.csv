Iron Man 3," WTF?! How could you do this to Iron Man fans?
","Extremely disappointed and frustrated after watching Iron Man 3. What a disaster! Shane Black is unfit to direct superhero movies. Why the hate? Read on...Iron Man Suit Abuse: The Iron Man suit is shown as a piece of junk metal that constantly malfunctions, powers down, breaks into pieces several times and gets ripped apart pretty much by every goon in the movie. And somehow one of Tony's older suits was able to withstand the force of Helicarrier's fan blades and Thor's lightning in Avengers? Iron Man Suit Army: I'm pretty sure that the writers who came up with this idea were seriously smoking pot. Tony who for the most part of the movie with the help of a kid attempts to repair Suit Mark 42 giving the impression that getting that suit working was the only hope, suddenly out of nowhere calls dozens of artificially intelligent Iron Man suits that autonomously fight bad guys (Jarvis kicks ass of course).Plot: ***This space is intentionally left blank due to the absence of a real plot.***Mandarin: The twist with Mandarin may have been for comedic effect or shock value or both but it only lasted for a few minutes, however as the movie progressed it certainly left a bad taste in the mouth and the overall tone of the movie changed from funny to frivolous. I think this was a weak attempt at mimicking the whole Ra's Al Ghul is really Ducard twist in Batman Begins. While Nolan masterfully delivers his surprise, Shane Black manages to mess it up for the fans!Visual Effects & Screenplay: They definitely knocked this one out of the park. Absolutely phenomenal special effects, from changing suits mid flight to the way the suit flies and fits on Tony's body is a visual treat to watch. If this is your only expectation from the movie, you will not be disappointed and will love the movie.Maya/Rebecca Hall: Her character was boring, useless and an absolute waste of time.Tony Stark/Robert Downey Jr.: As always RDJ's performance is top notch. He owns the character and eats up the screen with his charisma, wit, sarcasm and the gift that makes his written lines appear utterly spontaneous and genuine. He gives Tony Stark his awesomeness!Supporting Cast: Paul Bettany as always is awesome as Jarvis. Gwenyth Paltrow does a pretty decent job and Jon Favreau is funny as Happy Hogan. But William Sadler as the President? Uh... did anyone notice that this guy has the looks and demeanor of a psycho villain?Air Force One: So they just let Iron Patriot into Air Force One without even asking him to unmask and check if he really is James Rhodes? Bravo Shane Black for not thinking this through!Overall the movie did not take itself seriously, humor was forced into every possible situation and Shane Black beyond doubt proved that he just doesn't get comic books, let alone direct a blockbuster superhero movie. Please leave that to talented directors like Christopher Nolan and Joss Whedon!I will give this movie 6 out 10 just for RDJ's acting and spectacular visual effects.",6,3,6,5 May 2013
The Dark Knight," One of the best movies ever made. See it to believe it!
","This Joker will put a smile on your face! Batman History: Gone are the days when Adam West's campy Batman T.V series used to be the only source of 'Bat Entertainment' for the audience. The Batman movies of the 90s did not do justice to the great comic book icon. They all made the caped crusader appear as a happy-go-lucky masked vigilante who saved the day at the end with his 'Bat Gadgets'. Where was the character development? A real plot? (Oh please, not the penguin-stole-candy-from-a-baby plot). The superficial storyline and lack of commitment catalysed the fiasco of the Batman franchise. All in all, much to the dismay of fans, a costly costume party was all that we ever saw!A Knight was born: 'Batman Begins' at last delved into the dark and troubled past of Bruce Wayne. A man trying to find his identity, conquer his worst fears and overcome the grief of the unjust murder of his parents. A man who becomes invincible as a symbol. The magic of this movie lies in the fact that although it is not real, it makes you want to believe that it is! The Dark Knight: The success of Batman Begins opened the flood gates of great expectations and surreal anticipation for perhaps one of the most awaited movie sequels, let alone a Batman sequel. With expectations and speculations running wild, the overzealous promotion and media hype knew no bounds. The Dark Knight was put under microscope long before its scheduled release. The tragic loss of Heath Hedger, especially after whispers of his alleged over-the-top performance, added fuel to the fire. With fans and critics eagerly waiting to sing praise or eviscerate the movie alike, Dark Knight made a smashing entry! The question is, did this movie deliver? Did it live up to the unrealistic expectations of the fans? No. It surpassed it! This movie is not just for fans of Batman, but for all those who love to see a masterpiece. It certainly stretched the limitations of a typical comic book movie. The Joker is not just the avergae psychotic villain who blows things up and deliver jabs and witty retorts. No no no no no! He is more than that. A lot more than that. His every word has a deep psychological connotation to it. He poses moral dilemmas that play with the boundaries of normal ethical conduct and human psyche. Simply put, he puts people under the microscope and test their reaction under extreme situations. And he does it with flair! That's the beauty of it. He creates ingenious situations and traps that tricks everybody into believing something, while something else is happening. Bruce Wayne is pushed to such extremes that he thinks that his days as the caped crusader are coming to an end... As Rachel puts it, 'Bruce don't make me your only hope for a normal life'. We also find that The Joker and Batman have a lot in common. Joker pretty much sums up the entire comic book history between him and Batman as 'You and I are destined to do this forever'... Although they are portrayed as freaks with troubed childhood, it all comes down to the choices that people make at testing times. Harvey and Bruce are both influenced by The Joker's brilliant yet fiendish schemes and the outcome is colossal... You've gotta see it for yourself! This so much more than an action movie. A psychological thriller? Perhaps. The way Joker manipulates human nature is simply 'mind blowing'. Believe me, he is more than what you expect him to be in every single moment of the movie. His influence on Harvey Dent is even more intriguing than it is on the rest. And the fact that special effects are less prominent compared to character development and storyline goes to show that drama and theatrics impacts people on a personal level that all the CGI in the world cannot conjure up. It simply makes you care for the character rather than being a mute spectator of a violent showdown. This movie revolves around deep forgotten fears, traumas, hope, faith and courage. This is poetry in movie making!Rating: 10/10 No questions asked!",10,11,23,7 August 2008
Prometheus," Incredible visual effects masks mediocre acting and writing!
","The total lack of character development, uninteresting and predictable plot, the 'what the hell just happened and why on earth would you do that?' writing and worst of all, failure to 'scare the living c*** out of the audience' hides behind spectacular visual effects, interesting core concept, Michael Fassbender's performance and the hope that a sequel might set things right.The movie starts with a great promise, an interesting discovery, intriguing ideas and an alien world full of hidden mysteries. You of course wait for things to heat up and keep you on the edge of your seat from that point on, unfortunately it pretty much goes downhill from there, except for a few good scenes along the way. The characters simply did not have any 'character'. If you wanted to see some kick a** alien action, you should probably lower your expectations.Overall Prometheus sets things up pretty well and if the movie makers learn't anything from their mistakes in this movie, they might save it with a more 'intelligent' sequel. Perhaps for a casual moviegoer who just wants to see great Sci-Fi visual effects, Prometheus might just do the trick!I will give it 7/10 for special effects and an interesting concept.",6,1,3,9 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Perfect Finale.
","Words cannot adequately describe how awesome this movie is! It is everything you thought it would be and much more. Most certainly a beautifully crafted psychological crime thriller and a truly satisfying conclusion that does justice to the trilogy. Batman isn't exactly the cool hero with fancy gadgets nor is he the strongest. His inner strength is tested, he is physically and mentally pushed to his limits and all odds are against him. What an epic finale! Christian Bale as always is perfect as Bruce Wayne and Batman but Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane almost steals the show. Unlike Batman's mask where you get to see the emotions through eyes and mouth of the actor, Bane's mask covers his entire mouth, leaving only his eyes in view. Despite an obscured face, actor Tom Hardy seems to have found a way to brilliantly express his emotions physically! He projects Bane's character, the strength, pain, attitude and the darkness by movements and body language alone! Bane is as intellectual as he is strong, which makes him genuinely terrifying. He is easily the most formidable of all Batman villains in the trilogy and simply owned the scenes he was in. Hans Zimmer does an excellent job with the background score that sets the pace of the movie and compliments the visual artistry. The music makes you feel the excitement and energy of the movie. Both Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt do justice to their characters. Hathaway is believable as Catwoman. Last but not the least, Michael Caine gives a very effective and heartfelt performance as Alfred. The special effects in this movie are so good, that it seems very real. The Batpod, which made its appearance in Dark Knight is back in this movie and it is exceedingly cool. But wait till you see 'The Bat'! This movie has a stellar start, will keep you on the edge of your seat with adrenaline-pumping action sequences, intense drama both emotional and dark, has several layers of the story interweaving with frequent curve balls thrown in. But the movie never loses momentum, it ultimately sets you up for a fantastic climax and probably a very unpredictable yet satisfying end. It will keep you guessing till the very last second and that is the magic of Christopher Nolan's amazing masterpiece, The Dark Knight Rises.I will give this movie 10 out of 10.",10,15,27,21 July 2012
