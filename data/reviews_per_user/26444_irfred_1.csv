The Blair Witch Project," And as the film ended, you could hear someone say...
","'Does anybody else feel like they've just been screwed?'  ...and it wasn't me. Although I felt just like that.  This movie lured me in because of the hype, and I feel truly ashamed.  From the beginning, i hated the campy trio as much as the stupid kids from the Real World.  Throughout the rest I kept wanting something scary to happen.  But scared i was not.  The suspension of disbelief was not executed at all, and the audience reaction was very bland; just laughs, no screams.  But, i guess those pretentious enough to discuss camera angles during the movie found it fairly spooky. (**/*****)",4,0,2,3 August 1999
