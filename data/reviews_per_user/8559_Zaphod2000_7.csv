Captain Phillips," Absolutely ridiculous -so bad it's laughtable...
","Well ,I really tried to watch Captain Phillips but it was just stupid and I had to walk out. First of all ,the concept of the movie was okay ,but it was executed as a pretentious 'realistic based on' kind of movie instead of just an action movie or thriller which could work a lot better.Second ,some parts in the movie caused a lot of people in the theater in a way of 'dude ,wtf did I just watched?' such as the scene revealing the fact the Somalian pirates took over the ship bare foot or some parts with stupid cynical jokes that made Captain Phillips looks like some sort of a Z Grade comedy made in Somalia including Tom Hanks as the main character.In conclusion: avoid at all costs -overrated ,boring ,stupid ,don't waste your money.",2,9,33,25 October 2013
American Pie," Unwatchable unfunny crap....unbelivebly awful -beyond words
","Honestly ,I can't really understand how a trash movie like this one became such a 'cult classic' for some people ,a really hyped and overrated one anyway. There's absolutely no plot nor story or any kind of interesting characters (not mentioning there's no character developments or any information about their background or anything...) -what's the big hype behind this movie anyway?.... it's obviously just a bunch of stupid teenagers who wants to get sex -so each and every scene were dedicated for this purpose -like a collection of bad scenes along with terrible writing. But the worst part is the fact that it's not even funny -not even a single joke....the whole humor is just too vulgar (mainly sex jokes) and uninspired garbage without any meaning nor aim behind it -In conclusion: sex comedy movies sells even more then a cheap porno for everyone ,spreading the message of stupidity around the world faster -grabbing more cash from the worst kind of idiotic audience that keep funding this crap.",1,11,28,24 June 2012
Bad Teacher," waste of time -avoid this horrible unfunny movie
","Well...I've watched this entire movie (it was extremely hard to watch) ,it was another one of those movies with big hype around them which supposed to be funny--except it's not funny at all. The whole thing was written and executed by some lazy people who consider this movie to be a comedy -it's a very shallow movie with vulgar and sexist humor.Worse ,there wasn't much of a story nor any plot developments or any interesting character -the whole thing was a dead end since the beginning of the movie ,a complete waste of time.And besides ,this movie was so immoral it feels like reaching an all new low for our lives. In conclusion: pure garbage ,pure crap ,awful beyond words -avoid at all costs.",1,10,16,30 December 2012
Batman Begins," the end of Batman as you knew it
","Well...this is just another bad action movie based on a comic book -that has nothing to do with the original book. First of all ,the movie has changed the entire character of Bruce Wayne -he's not an arrogant one like Christian Slater's acting ;he's more like a quite rich and respected gentleman who's life as a superhero are way different and separated then his life as another everyday person. And besides -the batmobile is just ridiculous in the movie -I mean ,a heavy kind of an armored tank....? what's wrong with you people?...the batmobile is way different in the book ,not mentioning all the unnecessary special effects around the movie and the random sequence of events (bad scrips and bad writing...). In conclusion: dry ,boring ,another pointless remake -too overrated and too hyped.",2,3,7,25 June 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," lame excuse for an action movie: awful ,uninspired ,and pointless
","Well...I wasn't expecting much from this movie but I didn't think it would be that bad either.It's a highly overrated and hyped movie which is a complete waste of time...the problem with it is simply everything: writing (characters ,story ,sequence of events...) direction (terrible...) and cast (unconvincing).It has a ridiculous story which was written by some very lazy writers and it's really uninspired that recycles the whole 'revenge' thing in movies these days not mentioning the flat and meaningless characters and the random sequence of events that doesen't make any sense at all.And besides -it's long and endless ,boring ,pointless ,and awful.In conclusion: trash ,a garbage movie which is a lame excuse for an action movie.",1,5,9,25 August 2012
The Dark Knight," The dark knight falls: Nolan prooves the art of marketing & commercialism ....
","Well...First of all ,the whole story and plot got nothing to do with the original comic-book story (which already makes it even more unauthentic and unwatchable then it already is...). The Joker basically had some help killing the mobsters of Gotham City along with other 'freaks' /Batman's foes like him -like Two Face ,Poison Ivy etc').Second ,the movie changed the whole atmosphere and story into a shallow script with too much special effects and CGI not mentioning big stunts and the same predictable and uninspired below mediocre kind of plot common to most action movies and comic-based movies these days.And besides ,the acting and direction were just bad and some characters seemed not convincing and stupid not mentioning the way the writers changed some important /key characters like the Joker (Heath Ledger was just weird...he didn't fit to the Joker's role). In conclusion : a complete waste of time including your brain cells ,an endless and unwatchable crapfest--an overrated and over-hyped lame knight who is not a gentleman ,nor a good movie or a good comic book adaption.",1,8,21,25 June 2012
Inception," Lame excuse for a scifi action movie: uninspired ,unoriginal ,endless ,and pointless
","Well ,after watching it in the theaters (I wasn't expecting much since the beginning of it) I've finally decided to write a review as honest as possible. It's simply another commercial trick that was made in purpose to get the money out of your wallets and it's just another one of those movies pretending to be some kind of an intelligent movie -and well...it's not exactly quality -more like garbage. The whole idea of 'breaking into people's dream and thoughts' is a total stealing from many TV shows and other movies ,comic books etc...you've all seen it before ,I mean -how many times have you seen this idea before?...dozens at least , not mentioning the stupid plot which is just ridiculous.The idea of making an idea more messy then it actually is is pretty dumb--it's not making any sense at all. It's way overrated and way too hyped and doesen't even deserve half the half of it's rating ,not mentioning how unconvincing the entire cast was -the whole thing is a big waste of time :it's boring ,endless and very uninspired ,total unoriginal garbage stealing other people's ideas and thoughts while numbing stupid people's brains even more... If you didn't understand the movie or just hated it ,I'll strongly recommend you to read Rex Reed's review on Observer.",3,8,13,26 June 2012
