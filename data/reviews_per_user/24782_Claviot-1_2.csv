The Devil's Advocate," You Have to Sit Through This Movie Just for the Ending It's That Good
","OK, let me just get this out of the way Al Pacino is one of the most under-appreciated actors of all time. He has only been given one Oscar in his entire movie career and he has deserved at least three. Same with Robert Deniro, but he won two and he's not in this movie. If you don't get a Oscar nod for what he did in this movie I do not know what the Academy is looking for when it comes to Best Actor. Do you have to be in one of the best movies or most controversial movies to be considered for a Oscar. It's ignorant and moronic on the part of the Academy. Especially since 1997 was a very weak Oscar year. A nod is all I'm asking for, just a nod. He didn't deserve the award, but damned if he didn't earn a nomination in that final scene. Giving everything you could possibly think the devil could do to lure you into his world. Make you into what he wants and turn your world upside down. He even ups the performance of Keanu Reeves to the point where that accent isn't even bothering you anymore. Your actually feeling the turmoil and what exactly is riding on his decision and it's all Al Pacino. The Academy wanted Pacino to look but not to touch, well OK they let him touch, but very rarely a taste, OK a taste but never a swallow. And thats how it is. A great actor gives a great performance and devils in Hollywood just play a huge joke on him. I think Dustin Hoffman has been nominated enough don't you? Watch this movie the ending is enough, but the rest is great too. Interesting story and amazing visuals.",10,1,1,16 April 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Tim Burton Couldn't Tell a Plot if it Hit Him in the Face
","I thought Charlie and the Chocolate Factory would be better than this. Unfortunately Tim Burton again manages to screw me out of $9.25. Granted I didn't have high hopes from this movie to begin with, but I believed it would be a more mature version of book than what was done in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (I happen to like this adaptation because Gene Wilder is enchanting as the eccentric factory owner). Tim Burton introduced a new form of dragging with this movie. He completely omits the main character from the film in favor of developing a back story for almost every character. The one with the longest and most intricate back story is Willy Wonka. His back story encompasses the entire second and third parts of the movie (that being the factory tour in flashbacks and the post factory tour). The only thing it accomplishes is explain Johnny Depp's portrayal of the character, which wasn't bad. Wonka is presented as a man-child with deep fears stemming from the authority of parents. This is why I prefer Gene Wilder's portrayal in the 1971 version because he acts like he's in control of the entire factory. He's an adult who sympathizes with childish surroundings. Depp acts like he's completely oblivious to his surroundings, which makes you wonder how he can get anything done. He acts almost like Howard Hughes, but without the get things done attitude and need to advance technology to the next generation, which you'd think be needed to run a factory and keep the Deep Roy's alive. Once you think the movie's over your hit in the face with the third part of the movie, which tries to tie up Wonka's back story. To make sure you know Charlie is still in the movie they run a short story on him before finishing up the Wonka plot. You wonder why this adaptation wasn't called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory because Charlie had a much bigger role in the 1971 version. The movie ends in a nice little package but it is seriously deformed by Tim Burton's inclusion. The chocolate factory has the same Gothic styling and abrasive colors seen in every one of his movies. We know you have a signature, but Jesus try something else for a change. The musical numbers were also very weak. I read somewhere the lyrics came from the book, but the singing and the music were so awful I barely noticed them. Deep Roy needs to be shot so he cannot contaminate the rest of the world. If I wanted to see a bad musical number I would go see Rent. I only take solace in the fact this movie distracted Burton long enough for Batman Begins to correctly represent the Batman character. Thank you Tim Burton for not touching Batman in favor of adapting a newer version of the chocolate factory. You have truly placed yourself beside filmmakers like Ed Wood. At least he made bad movies with much smaller budgets.",3,17,31,25 July 2005
