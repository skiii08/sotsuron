","This movie is the best movie ever!! No seriously has there ever been a greater sports moment in US history than that!! Because this event brought the country together and was truly amazing! This is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made!! The amount of time and the players and events were recreated excellently!!! Kurt Russell was amazing in this movie and i cried my eyes out in the end!!! Now if we could just get the NHL to start playing again. Then everything would be great but this movie was put together very well and if you haven't seen it you really need to. Even if you don't like hockey or don't know a lot about it, the movie is a must see and i promise that you will like it or at least want to learn more or watch it again!!!",10,1,1,22 March 2005
