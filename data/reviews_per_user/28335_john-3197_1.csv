Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funniest movie ever - by far!
","I saw a preview show of the movie, and I spent most of the time rolling around in my seat with laughter. In fact I laughed so much, I missed some of the movie and will have to go and see it again. From the very beginning to the closing credits there was hardly a slow, non funny moment. As borat leaves his beloved Kazakhstan, along with its crude and open culture, he encounters the true American in many of its forms. He whips up the audience at a rodeo into a frenzy, and in the process discovers the inner mind of American rednecks. Some of the humor may be offensive, but it's worth it. This movie will end up being the highest grossing movie ever, I'm sure.",10,2,20,18 November 2006
