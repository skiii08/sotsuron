A Star Is Born," Stunning performances
",Didn't know what to expect from this film but was seriously impressed. Bradley Cooper and lady gaga are superb. The first 40 minutes or so is fantastic.

12 Angry Men," Astonishing film
","Never seen another film like this, every single actor acts knocks it out of the park, it's one of the most clever films I have ever seen. I was gripped from the beginning to the end. An absolute masterpiece in every way.",10,0,1,10 November 2019
Interstellar," Christopher Nolan's greatest film

The Shining," Jack Nicholson at his very best

Dunkirk," Probably Christopher Nolan's worst film
","This is not a bad film it's just not as good as the rest of his back catalogue. It doesn't flow and looks like he wasn't quite sure on how to tell the story properly. Some good performances. Wanted to love this film but just didn't. Watched it in the cinema and came out with my ears ringing, just too loud.",8,2,5,10 November 2019
Dunkirk," Great film but has its flaws

Schindler's List," One of the greatest war films

Reservoir Dogs," Watch it again, it's not as good as you thought it was
","Seen this film a few times, used to love it but at the end of the day it's not great, it's mainly set in 1 room and not much happens. Most people remember it for one scene. It's genuinely not a great film. Watch it again and I guarantee you won't think it's as good as you remembered it was.",5,2,5,10 November 2019
There Will Be Blood," Daniel day Lewis at his best

Joker," Joaquin Phoenix is unbelievable,,mind blowing performance
","Joaquin Phoenix is out of this world, very good film but not the greatest film ever. A little disturbing in places. Very clever film. Lots of nods to other similar ish films like taxi driver, psycho, king of comedy, clockwork orange. Thought provoking. Didn't live up to the hype personally. Todd Philips did a great job and I hope does similar stuff in the future.",6,2,10,5 October 2019
