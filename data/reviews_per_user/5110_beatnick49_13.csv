Sucker Punch," One of my top favourite movies
","A lot of films aren't nice to strong women. The are independent to a point, and in the end, need a man to save them. The film makers are either misogynistic ('Oh yeah, you're tough, but in the end you still need a man'), or maybe they feel a lot of viewers don't want to see women do it for themselves. The women in Snyder's movies are different, they don't need men to come to the rescue in the end, but take out the guys themselves. Take Lena Headey's Gorgo who stabbed the a-hole councilor in the gut, rather than need a guy come to save her.The women of Sucker Punch are the same, they fight, no men by their side, and do it on their own. They are my ideal movie women, hot and tough. No damsel in distress garbage. There's no make out session with a boy friend, there's are some nice ass kickings, good special effects, dance practice routines,and the guys who imprison and exploit them get their comeuppances. The pay back comes at a huge cost however.The soundtrack is a ripper :-), and I'm never bored of playing it.Plus, there are two Aussies in the lead. Yeah :-) Emily Browning, and Abbie Cornish. Brwowning is the new comer, the strategist, and organiser of the break out, while Browning is the reluctant, skeptical, but willing rebel who joins in the plot.Plus the story is easy to follow.Some flicks with mind warping stories are good, but they're not the only type of entertainment. Not everything has to be Shakepeare or Dostoevsky.I know this movie has received a lot of flack; mixed reviews, a small profit, and worst movie of 2011 in a recent poll. A few people I've spoken to don't like it either. But I don't care. I'll like this movie even if I'm the only person who does, and even if I lose an argument in public and I am ripped to shreds.The only down side was that John Hamm didn't get his butt kicked. I would be nice justice on Don Draper.That said, this goes with The Craft, and Ghost World as my equal favourite movie of all time. Gorgeous iron women, no damsel in distress trash, Aussies in the lead, special effects, easy to understand, and an epic soundtrack. 10/10",10,4,7,25 December 2011
Troy," An Epic Achievement
","Speaking from the viewpoint of a reader of the Trojan War myth and a movie goer, this movie is great. In terms of story (and tradition of telling the Trojan War story), characters, special effects, it's a great piece of work. Even it's historical accuracy is good.I was able to compare this to The Illiad and other narratives, and this movie makes a view significant changes.(Menelaus's death, Paris's survival, Patroclus being a nephew of Achilles, and the war didn't seem to go long) But that didn't bother me in the slightest because the story of the Trojan War has been altered over time since it's inception. Homer was not the first to tell it but merely the first to write it down. Altering the story has been apart of Trojan War tradition, and this movie has kept to it. I think this story is catering to modern tastes, but Homer was catering to the tastes of his time as well. And I don't think he would have a problem with this at all. Like I say, the movie is keeping with tradition.The basic narrative however remains the same with the elopement of Helen and Paris, the reluctance of Achilles to go, his closeness to Patroclus, the initial Greek victory, the quarrel over Briseis, Paris being a poor fighter, the Trojans repelling of the Greeks, death of Patroclus, Hector's and Achilles dual, Trojan Horse, and Fall of Troy. For that I like it. In the end Trojan war adaptations should just be a good story, and that's what this is. A damn good story. A story that, in this case, is well written, flows well, isn't not boring, quite engaging, and scripting thats solid.When reading The Illiad I was supportive of the Trojans, and this movie agrees with me, with the Greeks portrayed as warmongering, womanising, bullies. Homer had put a regal spin on the Grreks, but this movie had them as total jerks. Agamemnon, Menelaus the epitome of the attitude. I did not like Ajax in the book, and I was glad to see him die in the movie. Achilles, Patroclus, and Odysseus I didn't mind however. I felt really sorry for Hector having bad luck thrown on him repeatedly, Priam just wanted his city protected and genuinely believed the gods would help him, Andromache wanted her husband to be safe, Paris was pitiful but not unsympathetic, and the Trojans were just protecting their land. sympathetic characters are essential to me, for a good story and this movie delivers.The special effects were also good. For the armies and battles they were necessary, and complemented an already good story. It was quite a spectacle. The architecture and statues seemed consistent with 1200 BC. The military uniforms were consistent Greeks had their typical regalia, and the Trojans had west Asian suits rather than Greek uniforms in whixh they've been depicted in past efforts. The choreography is good too as seen in the battles.What's also good is the versatile cast. Eric Bana and Rose Byrne from Autralia, Diane Krueger from Germany (who is also VERY nice looking)Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean from England, Brian Cox from Scotland, Peter O'Toole from Ireland, Brendan Gleeson from Northern Ireland, and Brad Pitt from America. It's good to see the talent the rest of the world has to offer rather than confining it to the Hollywood big names.My only problem is that they gave little attention to Hecuba (Paris and Hector's mother) as well as Thetis. But otherwise it's damn good.Interms of story, characters, visuals, and historical accuracy, and (in my case) closeness to the written version, and keeping with Trojan War tradition this movie delivers. It's an epic achievement because the money spent on this has resulted in the above being converted to the big screen, in a visual and audial treat. An 8/10, Wolfgang Petersen, Homer would be pleased, and so am I.",8,0,3,4 January 2005
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Fantastic, Brilliant, A vanguard for the not so tall dark and handsome only one quam
","I saw an advance screening of this four days ago and I was not disappointed. This movie has everything that made the first one great, the characters and the good story. It also has some nice welcome additions such as influence from Pan's Labyrinth, and a new character.The great thing about Hellboy: The Golden Army and its prequel, is the characters. These are characters who are not tall dark and handsome, completely flawless, but are in fact quite 'human' (despite their abilities) while performing outstanding feats. They are also so sympathetic. The movie also features character development. Hellboy is not tall dark and handsome, but fat, red, bald, and has a stylised beard. He likes having beer, cigars, and (in the prequel anyway) working out. More importantly, he like cats, in most movies the heroes are dog lovers but Hellboy likes cats, a major pluss in my books. Even though he is the strongman of the team, he is resourceful, skilled and innovative. In a lot of movies the tough guys will treat the nerds as a joke, but Hellboy is a close friend and confidante to Abe, and love Lisa to the extent that he will give up his cats for her. Liz is also a great character, she is not slim, long haired and big busted, outgoing, but rather she has an oddball hair style, is toned, her bust size is of no concern in the movie, and will lash out if provoked. She is not a damsel in distress, with Hellboy needing her help in both movies. She is also a capable fighter with firearms. Abe, while being the nerd of the group is not a typical nine gram weakling with buck teeth, but is well spoken, able to use a gun, and functions as survellaince and forensics for the team. Johann starts off as the streotypical by the book yes man, but later turns into a character ready to break the rules for his close friends, and capable of outwitting Hellboy.A great feature of this movie is the character development. Abe show that he too is overcome with love for a woman and is unable to express his feelings, and tries singing pop love songs to woo her. Hellboy and Liz go from a loving couple, to a bickering couple (although the argument does interfere in their work, and Liz defend him from a hostile crowd different from other movies with bickering couples). Johann starts off as a lackey, but turns into a maverick like his team mates. In the end they all put each other first. We also get to see Hellboy as a boy, living as a typical kid, watching TV shows featuring puppets, believing in and waiting for Santa, having a bed time story read to him, and going to bed with a cowboy gun. I liked that. All round these are human characters with human concerns, Liz feels uncomfortable telling Hellboy about the baby but tells Abe (their mutual friend), they scuffle of 'their stuff', Hellboy likes to shave and keep beer in his locker, Hellboy and Johann fight in the locker room, Hellboy and Abe get drunk together and talk about women, and all feel the pangs of love.What is also good, is that Guillermo takes influence from his own move Pan's Labyrinth and places them here. It works well, blending fairy tales and the occult.A good scene is while Hellboys father is reading the story, Hellboy imagines the human, elfs, dwarfs etc as toys, as kids would. Not epi humans.My only gripe is that Liz's role was downplayed. Although she does contribute great;y, burning the tooth fairies, making the deal with the angel for hellboys life, melting the crown, and carrying the crown.A great movie all round. Worth it whether free or paid for.",9,2,5,31 August 2008
Watchmen," Snyder's best so far
","The superhero/superhuman has often been scrutinised, parodied, or brought down to earth within the world of the comic book or movie screen. The Incredibles looked at how superheroes would cope if forced into civilian life. The Civil War posed the question of whether superheroes are subject to the law or, by virtue of the work they do, immune from it. The Civil War also looked at how superheroes and superhumans would react to the question. Kick Ass, showed what would happen if real people decided to become masked vigilantes. Watchmen, even though based on a graphic novel written before either The Incredibles or Civil War, takes the scrutiny and parody in a different direction.In what is Snyder's best movie to date, the superhumans are 'super', their abilities beyond other humans. However, their 'hero' status is dependent on the public's perception of them. Masked vigilantes, with abilities, are popular when they first emerge in the pre-war America (1920s-1930s); they can pose with the police, they smile for the camera, they are depicted on war planes and can act gay in public in early post war America, and are also happily received if they reveal their secret identity. Their 'hero' status is only sustained because of positive public opinion. The Comedian a sadistic, racist, womanizing, rapist, who shoots his pregnant girlfriend (all unknown to the public) is a hero because he fights for his country. Whether people know or even care about his tendency to delight in burning Vietnamese alive is another matter. Ozymandius, is popular because he has given up heroics, and is the Bono of the movie. Roarscharch is hunted and regarded as a criminal because he is a masked vigilante, even though he gives low lifes the what for.This movie, also questions, just what is the hero. The person who saves people, the person who protects, the person who punishes? The Comedian protects his country, but has no altruism about him. Roarsharch still has childhood issues, and still holds a grudge to women, even though he is incensed at the murder of a girl, but inflicts punishment on crims and we may say, good, the guy deserves it. Ozymandius decides to protect people, by killing people, sacrificing lives to preserve life, and honestly believes he is doing the right thing.In the 1970s they become unpopular, possibly seen as thugs without oversight. In the 1980s, any superhuman who acts outside the law is regarded by the public and listed under the law, as a criminal. This deconstrunctionist approach to the super hero mythos is one of the strengths of the movie. The characters are just so interesting to watch. Even if they're unsympathetic, this makes the 'heroes' a joy to engage with, and a help make the 2 1/2 hour length more than worth it.The other joy in this movie, is seeing ratbags suffer. There is a certain joy in seeing muggers, child killers, and prisoners, mutilated or dying in gruesome. I actually laughed Roarshach gave the child killer what for, tossed cooking oil on the inmate, shove the guy in the tilet, and when the priosner got his arms sawed.I reckon inside a lot of us, there is a desire to see people like that, to get it, and get it good.Another good thing about the movie, is Silk Spectre II. Snyder had strong women in his last films, and he keeps up the trend in this one.Another point of this film I like is the twist it puts on the portrayal of communist and American leaders. Breshnev is not the fat, balding stibble faced gorilla, and Castro is not pudgy, with a bushy beard chomping on a fat cigar. They are tall, well built, serious, and know what they're doing, Nixon and Kissinger by contrast are fat, bloated, balding, slugs.The other strength in this film is it's solid story, even though may predict the twist, it's well told, and has momentum and keeps it going, it balances action, character development, story, and background, and it has few if any loopholes. It also looks at the inherent violence, and self destruction of humans.This whole movie, is just all round engaging. I was never bored when I watched it a year ago. Interested all the way. Only looking away to make comments about it, to my friends.Snyder has made great films in his career; Dawn Of The Dead, 300, and now this; his best one yet. I'm looking forward to Suckerpunch.Thnak you Snyder, for Watchmen.",10,2,5,14 May 2010
The Matrix Revolutions," Action, too many effects, but little story if any
","Warning may contain spoilersA boring, essentially special effects driven action movie, that lacks the mysticism and solid scripting of the original. To me it was just a standard sci-fi. The action scenes in this particularly the battle at the Dock and in the Tunnels were so long, and removed from the theme of the original that they were simply dull. What made this different from the second was that there were no moments of incomprehensible dialogue, but continuous action. I am unsure if this was a good thing or a bad thing, however neither were any good.While special effects are highly present in The Lord of the Rings, they are used where necessary and the triology is not reliant on them, as it is also moved along by the solid story and characters. All three concepts carry the story, with the first merely assisting the other two which are most important. The same could be said for Harry Potter. Any themes that the Matrix tried to convey were lost in the overboard action and special effects, and poor script. So much work was put into the action sequences and effects, it was though they were compensations for lack of story and used to fill in time. Effects are taken for granted these days, and can be boring if there are no descent accompaniments to them. There were so many they were not impressive.It seemed the basic plot was Neo awaiting his final duel with Smith after Smith had reached the height of his power, and long fights. I was so bored with it all I was sympathetic to the machines hoping that they would drill through the dock. There was so much imagery in this I felt like I was drowning in it.The ending in the film itself was good, but I didn't come out feeling rewarded. The film was not a good ending to the trilogy. It tried hard, but failed, to impress.",2,0,0,19 January 2004
American Psycho," An 'undisputed masterpiece'
","Warning may contain spoilersThis movie is (as Bateman said about Hip To Be Square by Huey Lewis and the News) an 'undisputed masterpiece'. Like Fight Club, it succeeds with wit, dark satire, and a great social comment, against superficiality, conformity, and consumer culture. Mary Harron directs an excellent film, and she and Guinevere Turner convert the book into a marvelous screenplay.This is a stunning and forthwright criticism on consumer culture, exposing it's mindlessness, ludicrousness, and rediculousness. The characters are immersed in a world of reservations, poular music, clothes fashion, affairs, and drugs. Countless restaurant and clothing brands are mentioned, with frequent appointments that must be met, Who has the best business card is a major obsession as are reservations.(Like they areb really that important) A good moment is when one of Bateman's friends who are among the people he competes with for the best business card, Van Patten, states that he is not really hungry but would like a reservation anyway. Chauvinism is also rampant, 20 years after the women's movement.The cast is also well picked, Christian Bale is excellent as the crack snorting chauvinist Patrick Bateman whose life seems perfect on the surface with the apartment, limo, job, fiance, and friends, however his life is, in reality dull; repetitious and surrounded by people he envies and dislikes (such as the upstart Paul Allen, and the annoying Luis Carrurthers). In fact his lifestyle robs him of his humanity and his life is mundane; so much so it drives him crazy and derives him of all intellect (apart from brand names, restaurants, and pop-music)and emotion apart from (as Bateman himself tells us) 'greed and disghust', his mind is so empty, killing is all he can 'do' to fulfill himself.As for the rest of the cast; Guinevere Turner is excellent as the model Elizabeth, Reese Witherspoon is excellent as the hopeful, and cheerful Evelyn Williams who is yet also a conformist like everyone else in the film, Chloe Sevigny is great as Jean, the innocent secretary and one of the victims of Bateman's chauvinism, and Willem Defoe was well picked as Detective Donald Kimball.In short a fantastic movie, worthy of an award (I hope it got one), I thouroughly reccomend it, but dn't expect anything light, it is gory and graphic. the best version is on DVD. Watch it.",9,3,6,24 February 2003
Spider-Man," A very good movie
","Not a fan of comic books I find that the movie adaptations are very entertaining (with the exception of The Punisher) and rather than be simple beat'em up flicks with no story and little talent, they are in fact quite the opposite, and this movie is no exception. While the concept of the weak rising to be strong is a very common theme, it makes a welcome change to what could have been a plotless action flick.The characters in this movie are all likeable. They are quite human for movie characters, they are vulnerable and their appearances conceal their realities, Peter Parker may acquire superhuman strength, but is quite lonely, Mary Jane Watson maybe popular and pretty but comes from a broken home, and the Osborns maybe rich but there is little amity between them. They pursue hard to reach targets with Peter pining after Mary Jane, Mary Jane gets a drab start to her acting career, the Osborns try to understand each other but can't take the initiative, while corporate success for Norman Osborn proves elusive. In a movie it's a good thing to have sympathetic protagonists, and this movie delivers.     The actors are all well picked, and play their parts well. Tobey Maguire gives a good, sympathetic performance as Peter Parker, who you jusy feel sorry for, and I was happy to see him pound that Flash. Kirsten Dunst gives a good, sympathetic performance as Mary Jane Watson, and is cute too. Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborn (who is sympathetic at first but then becomes a total jerk-wad) well, he is also very good as Osborns alter ego the Green Goblin, he's not an overblown villain. James Franco is pretty good as well, as Harry Osborn. Rosemary Harris plays a sweet Aunt May, and J.K.Simmons is amusing as Peter's employer.The scripting is good as well, it's a solid story that doesn't detract from the narrative. It's well directed by Sam Raimi, with the story moving along at a steady pace (helped along by the good cast) with the special effects and action ,which are impressive to watch, complementing the story rather than the other way around. The movie doesn't forget that it is an action movie, yet balances the visuals and character interractions very well; combined with the scripting it proves to be an engaging flick. It also goes at just the right amount of time at two hours and one minute. There's also some funny moments such as Peter trying to release the web, and Harry's end of the conversation with MJ after the fair. I certainly got my money's worth at the cinema, and I have seen it repeatedly on cable, yet have not got bored of it.In all it proves to be an entertaining, watchable movie. I would like to give it an eighrt and a a half, but since that's not possible I give it a nine out of ten because I enjoyed it so much. A very good movie. movie",9,0,1,7 July 2004
Collateral," A good urban thriller
","This movie works on many levels, with it's production and cast, resulting in a darn good movie.I saw this movie with a friend and acquaintance in the city. Before hand we had dinner in a kebab fast food store. It was a dark night, patrons came and went, stayed when we left etc. The view from the store was of the cinema, video game arcades, and other fast food stores, various city inhabitants, and various traffic (including annoying car life) It reminded me of a uni course I'd done, and look back on fondly.It was quite appropriate, considering this movie. It is a brilliant urban thriller. Tom Cruise plays Vincent with calm, cool, and coldness, and he does it well. He's also very convincing with grey hair. Jamie Foxx plays Max, from mild mannered, to fearful, to resorting to basic survival instinct, convincingly. Both their performances are good and Foxx has certainly earned, and is deserving of, his starring role in 'Ray' in my view.The camera work is good, and the style is effective,getting up close with the events in the cab. And the feel of urbania is good, with the camera work, and surroundings, the lights, buildings, and traffic. The storyline flows well (nothing too complicated), and coupled with the camera, and the feel for urbania and cast. It is a-political, and fun in the thriller and visual treat sense. The emphasis is not on the violence but on the thrills, 'what happens next?' is the question. This movie certainly had me engaged, I didn't realise how long it went for, and for that matter I didn't really care, I loved every minute of it. It actually made me think of my uni course. Urbania is unpredictable and will throw all sorts at you can be your best friend and give you wealth and fun, or it can be an enemy and give you danger. I would't say this is a social commentary on city life, but it certainly thrust me into the midst of urbania's personality. I guess all urban inhabitants are warriors, we put up with a lot with the aim of achieving and maintaining, whatever it is we're looking for.This is $11 and about two hours well spent, and a nine out of ten well earned. City life, throw what you have to offer at me, I like it. And I love this movie.",9,0,1,4 February 2005
Kick-Ass," It delivers, deconstructs and made me laugh
","Some critics and viewers have criticised Kick Ass, because of the character Hit Girl, for her swearing and (to a lesser degree) violence. I personally think Hit Girl is awesome (the daughter of Lisbeth Salander and Dexter Morgan), and I also think the criticisms miss the point.Kick Ass is advertised as an outright, slapstick comedy, with a simple story, when it is really a dark comedy/satire which (as a friend put it) deconstructs the superhero mythos. Still, this movie had plenty of moments that made me laugh. The guy leaping from the building, Kick Ass's crush on his teacher, Hit Girl's joke on Big Daddy, the car scene, and others.The characters are mostly really likable. Kick Ass has decided that he will stuff what others think, and he will help out people in trouble. Even though it comes at a price, he continues. Hit Girl and Big Daddy just want to take down the mafia, fix what the law has failed to do, and avenge the lady who was Hit Girls mum and Big Daddy's wife. These are things that many of us have probably wanted to do, and thought about doing.Another success of Kick is it's (as a friend put it) deconstruction of the superhero myth. Watchmen created inverted versions of DC superheroes and villains (The Comedian/Joker), and looked at how the world might treat masked, skilled vigilantes and super powered humans, if they actually existed. Kick Ass rather looks at how real, average humans would get by if they became masked vigilantes. Kick Ass is stabbed and hit by a car, Hit Girl loses her father, and Big Daddy loses his life. Kick Ass and Hit Girl do not come out of this unscathed.The movie is also a satire of society's attraction to violence, and it's satire of itself. During the torture scene, the TV stops airing it. The viewers, despite, being disturbed at the scene, race to the internet to see it. It could be seen as sending itself up. It's as though the makers knew the movie was going to be controversial, because of the violence, but people would go in, aware of what they in for.The next success is Hit Girl. She really steals the whole thing, and that is a good thing. She is a break from the monopoly of swearing being the monopoly of boys. She is tough, confident, and...well kick ass. They way she skewers the crims is fantastic. People who criticise the movie simply for the fact she is a violent, swearing 11 year old, just don't gell with me. It's their opinion and they're entitled to it. But really, what age is appropriate to mutilate people and drop the c bomb? The criticisms hypocritical, the boy in Role Models swore like a trooper (with the F bomb) and I heard nobody complain.As a comic book fan, and movie goer I really liked this movie. Bad guys get chopped, the movie takes shots at itself, Hit Girl is fantastic, and it's funny. I had a real good time with this film.",8,2,11,27 April 2010
8 Mile," Like Saturday Night Fever in the 90s, and that's not a compliment
","This movie stinks, I didn't think highly of it and still don't. It is a rip off of Saturday Night Fever, only set in the 90s, for starters.There are so many similarities between the two movies. For example; John Travolta has a lousy homelife, Eminem has a lousy homelife. John Travolta has a bland job, Eminem has a bland job. John Travolta seeks solace in his hobby and only escape, disco, Eminem seeks solace in his hobby and only escape, rapping. John Travolta goes into a contest, Eminem goes into a contest. John Travolta goes around town complaining with his mates, Eminem goes around town complaining with his mates. John Travolta meets a girl, Eminem meets a girl. John Travolta is a womaniser but gets upset when the lady he meets doesn't turn up, Eminem dumps his girlfriend but gets all upset when the new girl he meets is doing someone else. While I haven't seen the ending of either I'm guessing they both win the contests they enter.There are a couple of differences between the two, SNF is fictional, while 8M has been the subject of debate as to whether is is true, semi-biographical, or fictional. Also, Travolta is actually king of the dance floor, Eminem must rise to the top. Another difference is that I actually like John Travolta; he seems like a nice person, makes a good interview, and he's worked for an Australian airline, yay. Eminem on the other hand I detest, he sings many of his songs with a hateful tone, and (another reason why I dislike this movie) he has a martyr complex numerous km wide, and wears it like a crown.This movie is filled with Eminem's martyr complex, he's always wandering around with a pained look on his face, and frequently complains. 'Your friends don't know me', 'We're still living at home with our mums.' Please! Whatever your hangup is Eminem get over it. I was glad to see this piece of trash for a movie sent up on Scary Movie 3.However, One difference is that I could watch this movie longer than I could watch SNF. I reached a point in SNF where I had just had enough and went to bed. For this I was watching this at a friends place up to the end but missed it because I had to leave. It has been on TV but I have missed the ending there as well. So the director must have been doing something right to keep me watching.Nonetheless, for this movie's unoriginality, protagonist, and annoying martyr complex running through it I give this four out of ten.",4,10,29,6 December 2004
Black Hawk Down," I avoid it now like the plague.
","Warning, may contain spoilersI only whent to see this because I was dragged along by a friend. I didn't want to see it then and I still regret I ever saw it. I want my money and my two hours and twenty four minutes of my life back.What tries to come over as an anti-war movie delivers a patronising effort with a strong good guy/bad guy element, which anti-war movies should leave out altogether, it's not about whos right and wrong it's about everyone suffering. The comparisons were all too obvious. There were the soldiers fun loving, chidrens book illustrating, old show watching, family men. On the other side you had the grouchy, savage, militia. I am not denying the militia used hunger as a weapon, but the foreign forces there weren't the angels they were made out to be. They probably caused more damage and killed more people than the militia. The assistance by the army in this film is all to obvious. The movie was so slanted. Another problem was the excessive violence, sure thats what war is, but the movie was so quick to quick to violence, and when it got there  we were immersed in it save for a few quick breathers, that we had no time to learn about the characters. What we did learn was little and scattered. Characters in movies should have more depth than what happened here. You can leave out excessive violence, and give time for the characters to develop while still conveying and anti-war message. Enemy at the Gates is pure testimony to that.All that was good about the movie was the quote at the beginning by Plato, as I ma a lover of antiquity, the music which was reminiscent of Gladiator the better of the two by Scott. I was pretty ticked off at Eric Bana for doing this, if he hadn't made up for this with the mildly amusing Nugget, and the intellectual Hulk, I would have disliked him intensely. McGregor continued his run of bad movies such as Star Wars Episode I and this, making up for it with Episode II. And how could Orlando Bloom do the original (and worthy nearl three hours Lord of the Rings) and then do this churned out propaganda, thankfully he more than made up for it with the other two in the Rings triology. I'm interested to see how Bana and Bloom go in Troy.
The lesson from this keep Bruckheimer away from supposedly anti-war movies.",1,4,12,13 January 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Little good to say of this
","With few redeeming factors I would not feel guilty asking for a refund. Where the original was consistent and thought provoking this movie was had me thinking 'What the hell are you trying to say?' or had me not thinking at all. The original had a good concept, that our lives are a lie, and made good use of special effects but was not dependent on them as the story had a solid narrative. And even though it was a little complicated at first, it was soon understandable what was going on in that universe. This movie went from one extreme to the other; if there was not a whole lot of complicated and unnecessary jibberish  then there was just a whole lot of beat em up action. Much of the jibberish spoken I found incomprehensible. At some point in the mumbo-jumbo the speakers said an understandable sentence or two which got the point through and summed up all they needed to say in nutshell, but after they said it they continued on. Too much emphasis had been placed on the special effects in this one. More than necessary. Too many special effects and they're nothing. Each fight scene went for so long it was dull. Special effects are supposed to help the story along not be a substitute for it, and they are no substitute anyway for a descent, solid, consistent, original and entertaining narrative. They weren't that good anyway. And as for that rave party, that was just plain rediciulous. With all the lousy music and lousy dancing, they might as well have had flashing lights going and a bar while they were at it. They should have left it out. That speech on the rock was just pretentious.The pattern of the movie; fight, jibberish, fight, jibberish etc. Incomprehensible dialogue, high pumped special effects driven fight scenes and a weak story line were what this effort consisted of.Not an enjoyable experience.",3,0,1,13 January 2004
300," Pure Fun, 300%
","Zack Snyder seems like an enlightened version of Michael Bay. He's come up through commercials to fun action movies movies. One of the common features of Snyder's flicks, are hot tough iron women, in contrast to Bay's lead women who always end up needing a man to save them. Snyder by contrast has had Sarah Polley in Dawn Of The Dead, Silk Spectre in Watchmen, and the chicks galore in the upcoming Suckerpunch. In between DOTD and WM came 300, with Lena Headey, as the posh hot iron woman Queen Gorgo, who gives the messenger cheek and reams the traitor with a sword.This movie is also great fun. the story is easy enough to follow, the Spartans sympathetic, the blood flows, plenty of action, and good momentum. I just sat back and watched the movie go, nothing hard to think about, but not the crap you get on TV. The movie's also got moments of reprieve, where you can take a breath, and then dive back into the next slaughter, unlike Sin City which was non-stop, too much, and thought misogyny and violence against women are okay.The special effects do the movie justice. They create the atmosphere of the flick, immerse you in the world the Spartans, and makes great escapism.The music score is good to, epic and dark, sometimes together, sometimes on their own.And the really good thing is the entertainment, let your brain switch off, go for the ride, and have a good time, at the movies or on DVD, on any night. It's great escapism, forget the political debates, financial news, sport and celebrity gossip, this helps one forget it all. No political agenda, no melodrama/temper tantrums/mental breakdowns/drugs/domestic disputes/corrupt cops. This has a set of characters you like, good SFX, nice action scenes, good momentum, easy story, and a tough hot queen. 300 delivers.300% pure fun.",9,2,4,14 January 2011
