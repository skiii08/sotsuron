Blade Runner 2049," Really surprised by the negative reviews for this
","I'm not a fan of the director ... I found Arrival a self important, boring, reboot of so much that has gone before ... I also am no fan of Mr Gosling ... Not that he's bad in this day and age of 'actors', just a bit ... Whatever He was perfect for this part ... He makes a fine 'whatever' here... And the director gets the atmosphere right ... It didn't even seem overlong ... For me to only think ' I wonder how much longer it is to go ? ' once is a breakthrough these days ... But for some unknown reason some people really don't seem to like it !!! ... My advice, don't listen to any of us, go and see it if you want ... I personally would advise you to see it on the biggest screen you can, cos if you don't and you see it on the monitor at home, there's a really good chance that you'll regret it ... Its not perfect ... But what is ?",9,3,12,15 October 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," 25% gold... 75% ****
","Kill Bill 1 was a masterpiece... A brainless action masterpiece, but a masterpiece none the less... But quite frankly, apart from a half hour segment in the middle where The Bride kills Elle, Kill Bill 2 REEKS... Everyone is saying it gets away from the action and finalises the story with the usual Tarantino wordplay... I WISH.... Lame dialogue that sounds like someone else was trying to copy Mr Tarantinos old style and failing dismally... Silly plot contrivences that just made you cringe... All together a not at all special piece of celluloid... Bill is such a boreing and pompous character that I just wanted her to kill him as soon as he got onscreen and bored us to tears As a film 3 out of 10... Half hour in the middle 10 out of 10 ( which unfortunately shows the rest of it as the dismal pile of crap it is )",Null,1,3,26 April 2004
Sucker Punch," Like 'Showgirls' ... But without the talent
",'Showgirls' but with no laughs ... The fact is the actors and actresses in Showgirls were really talented and having a laugh ... This lot of vapid bimbos have less depth than your average puddle And that awful Emily Browning who looks like she has a surgery problem already and just looks like some plastic thing is the worst of the whole bunch Do we care about any of these bimbos as they go through their computer game hell ... Not a bit of it ... We are shown nothing to like ... They are just avatars ... If they die who cares And there is something destinctly peado going on in here ... A sick underlying mentality Its a sort of Spiceworld with a cast of nobodies ... Not for one minute that I'd call Spicegirls anything other than disposable pap either : )) Its visually brilliant of course ... Pity they couldn't have found something worthwhile to justify all that work ... Though its all second hand ideas and looks from other films ... Nothing original And the music blares throughout ... And all COVER VERSIONS :))) That about sums it all up really AWFUL,2,7,17,30 March 2011
Hereditary," Sooooooo Annoying
","I'm sorry but this film could of been ok, but I hated it from the start ... Every character in that family was so annoying I'D HAVE KILLED THEM MYSELF ... There was nothing to care about ... The whole thing failed because the writer or director made them all so damn unlikable that the story just didn't matter ... The director obviously saw Martyrs and went for a biiiiiiig curve ... And the whole thing could have been quite good ... IF IT WASNT FOR THE CHARACTERS ... Hateful People",3,2,6,28 September 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Imagine 'Allo Allo' without the silly bits ... Truly awful
","Reservoir Dogs was a fine and clever thriller ... When Pulp Fiction came out I was just knocked out by its inventiveness and humour ... Jackie Brown was OK but nothing great even though there were some fine performances ... Kill Bill 1 was absolutely mind bogglingly great :)) ... Kill Bill 2 not so ... Then Mr Ts half of Grindhouse was kind of rally crap actually ... Can't even remember what it was called ... Planet Terror ( the other half of Grindhouse ) was what Mr T should have made, cos it was brilliant Then this ... This thing ... Apparently cost 75 million to make !!!! ... Well at least half a million made it to the screen ... It looks like some cheapo TV production ... The acting !!! ... Well apart from the two women and a couple of minor male supports none of this lot should be allowed in front of a camera again ... Pitt included ... Amateur hour at the Mr Clever factory Tarantino used to write really clever scripts, but there is none of that here ... He nearly gets there in the basement bar, but nowhere near his earlier achievements So please ... Its not violent ... Its not funny ... Its not clever ... How its got such a high vote on here is very suspect ... The fact is its just no good and I would advise anyone who hasn't seen it yet to realise that there was a reason for that ... Its not worth seeing",2,5,8,26 December 2012
World War Z," Boring and pointless
",Why do these idiots in Hollywood keep buying these books and turning them into this sort of nonsense ... This has got 2 big set pieces ... Not from the book ... And then the money ran out obviously and the rest of it looks like a daytime soap ... Its awful ... They obviously realised how bad it was when it first got stopped ... This should never seen the light of day Its boring ... A zombie film ... But with no blood so it can't even be unsettling ( and I saw the unrated version ) ... Its just rubbish The script is terrible ... There are some really cringe worthy American ' family is all that matters' moments that could well of flopped out of a 50s Disney fiasco Don't bother wasting your time ... Its worse than people said ... A complete waste of time,2,5,10,4 September 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Ponces in Space
",Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan ...Alice Eve as some annoying blonde bint ... Both of whose acting ability seems to have flopped out the bottom of some midday soap opera ... Yeah ... Right ... Space is going to be peopled by a load of British ponces in the future !!! ... Now don't get me wrong ... I am British ... But the accents on these two were absolutely painfully WRONG ... Hollywood has taken to scouring oxford and camebridge universities for future 'talent' ... In other words its sucking up to the investors and shoving their talentless offspring onto our screens ... God knows if those two went to either but they sound as if they'd like to have if they didn't ... Benedict Cumberbatch is such a dobbin he makes anything a pain to watch ... Alice Eve is such a non event it just doesn't matter Totally ruined the film for me ... MIGHT have been OK otherwise ... But certainly nowhere near as good as the first one anyway ... Seemed like it was rushed and made really quickly without much thought going into it Pity really ... But no surprise with Hollywood now,3,0,3,7 September 2013
Interstellar," Complete nonsense done with a lot of arrogance
","This was a corker ... Mathew Maconnaghay painted a strange colour yellow for most of the film ... He also has a really badly put on accent ( god knows what its supposed to be ) ... Family Family Family Hollywood can only drivel on about Family ... The ONLY decent acting in this came from John Lithgow who mak=de an early exit ... The plot is chucked together from the usual suspects ... The director obviously watched 2001 too often ... The time anomaly at the end seems to be a K hole ... I mean !!! ... Get over it ... This is seriously mediocre time filler ... There is no intelligence going on here, just the usual Hollywood drivel ... Uninspired visuals ... And a serious lack of imagination ... I spent nearly 3 hours on this thing as I thought it may pay off in the end ... I was soooooo wrong Vapid and insulting",1,9,16,23 January 2015
Pacific Rim," The cinematic equivalent of BLING
","Are there lots of explosions ? - Yes Is it bright and colorful ? - Yes Is there a story ? - No Is there any character development ? - No Is it interesting ? - No Is it innovative ? - No Is there an interesting message ? - No Has it all been done before ? - Yes , every little bit, just never all thrown onto the screen quite like an upchucked multi coloured ice cream like this sickening little money waster was Of course it will all be outdone soon on the effects front and there isn't one iota of an idea or image that will be remembered from this pile of overblown Hollywood tripe I managed to watch it all the way through in a state of shock ... Its not that it doesn't keep you looking ... Its just that it wastes the eyes ... And your left just thinking WTF have I just sat through STINKY VACUOUS NONSENSE",1,11,24,6 October 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Complete Brothers Grimm ripoof with a script from SciFi Channel ... Awful
",This was really pathetic ... I only managed half an hour of it ... I hate criticizing any thing with Famke Janssen because she is always so good ... She is quite capable of projecting pure evil without sticking a load of cliché'd cgi witchiness all over her face The fact is that the story of this concerns the blood moon and the kidnapping of 12 children ... Sound Familiar ... Yes ... Exactly the story from The Brothers Grimm ... Done as an action movie ... And not very well ... Visual and story clichés abound Gemma Atherton is as usual the personification of mediocrity ... Why this woman thinks she is an actress is anyones business ... She completely lacks character on screen and would ( just about ) manage to look right behind the makeup counter of Boots rather than on the big screen ... VAPID Jeremy Renner ... Short ... Portly ... Moody little man ... Not very exciting at all Then of course we have Peter Storemeare as the sheriff ... A very similar role as in... Guess What ? ... The Brothers Grimm Terry Gilliam really should sue this lot of talentless oinks Its not witty ... Its not exciting ... Its cliché'd beyond belief Pointless Rubbish,2,16,35,7 May 2013
Climax," I have never liked Noe's movies ... Until Now
","Before Climax I have actually disliked his films ... I haven't found anything clever or interesting about them ... In fact I've found them annoyingly and deliberately difficult, not an approach I appreciate ... Climax is SERIOUSLY WELL DONE ... He is growing up ... I still would have liked to know more ... Why he only concentrated on the negative aspects of the experience and the people who had a ( really ) bad time ... Why a certain person died when they could have easily got away ... Why that person did it ... AND HOW TO DANCE LIKE THE GIRLS IN THE BLACK SLASHED DRESS AND THE BOY IN THE BLUE ADIDAS TOP ... Cos they were brilliant",8,4,12,27 January 2019
Foxcatcher," How did they manage to make this story SOOOO DULLL ?
","Sorry this story had major possibilities and Hollywood made a complete mess of it as usual ... Hey Hollywood ... Don't you realise yet that until you start employing talented writers and directors that are capable of having a broader vision than their last washing powder commercial you are going to get less and less people interested in seeing your films Channing Tatum had obviously been directed to act like a retard ... OK he might not be the most talented actor, but this was farcical ... Steve Caroll ( whoever he is ) was just one dimensional skin crawly ... I would of thought the fact that the character was an totally untalented, over privileged arms dealer would probably have been enough to make the point without the creepy performance The major problem of course is its just not in the slightest bit exciting or interesting And god knows where this winging about homo eroticism comes from cos this yawn fest is way less sexual than even the most average wrestling match",3,13,28,7 January 2015
It Follows," Boring, and those vacuous brats have the worst clothes sense in cinema history
","Jesus H Christ ... THIS is what passes as horror these days !!! ... Feeble characters being 'threatened' by something thats following them ... Totally lacking in style or substance this is like an episode of 'Neighbours' with less likable characters ... This has been hyped to the gills and had comparisons made with Halloween and Suspiria :)))) ... YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ... What we have here is a director that is determined to make films and knows how to bleed the crappy system for cash ... Unfortunately he hasn't got a clue what to do with it and thinks his vacuous ideas are worth hurling on screen ... Yes it has had people that like it ,,, 'The Birdy Song' sold millions ... This is painfully vapid ... I admit I only made it half way through and something interesting COULD have happened in the second half but quite frankly I hated the people in it so much that I really couldn't give a damn ... Pointless waste of time",1,69,150,9 May 2015
Drive," More vacuous spawn of Tarantino ... YAWN
",Vacuous is the only word to describe this ... The reason it was popular must have been with the proles that like car chases ... Gosling may be brain damaged ... Refn just comes off as some sad Tarantino wannabe ( and who in their right mind would want to be like that !!!! ) ... The colours are pretty ... Its well filmed ... But there's nothing going on beyond a 1990s Tarantino rip off ... The lead actress looks like someone else You can scream as much as you like about disassociation of modern society but all it comes down to in the end is a void ... There's nothing there ... And if it reflects you then its because there's nothing in you ... And you can scream and shout as much as you like about how society has made you like that but its crap ... You have let yourself become that ... Void,3,3,6,17 August 2013
Evil Dead," No Scares ... Not Particularly Gory ... And No Fun !!! ... SAD
","And why is that ... The Actors ( ? ) ... Obviously this lot just flopped out of some hideous soap ... One blonde one is so superfluous that she has 3 lines and is obviously just there to die ... After which she still does very little ... They are just characterless ... The original was hardly high on character building but each of them brought their own characters to the part and threw themselves into it completely ... Bruce Campbell was a great lead character ... The innocuous little nobody in this that plays the main lead I couldn't even be bothered to look up ... Forgotten already ... So CASTING ... CRAP Writing ... Can't even remember a line of the dialogue ... So lets say totally pointless Direction ... Some seriously bad copies of the original inventive camera moves ( how can they do this worse with a budget !!!!! ) ... Pretty static and flat all round ... Why did this guy get to direct ? THE GORE ... The original is gorier and more gross in a daft way ... This was pretty feeble ... Their is a lot of blood rain but so what At the 70 minute mark it completely looses it when the lead male does something so pathetically stupid you want to leave the cinema ... Just totally inexcusable ... After that they obviously had no idea where to take it and its GLARINGLY obvious The End ... Well there isn't one really Best part is before the opening credits where it actually showed potential ... Once the main characters are introduced forget it Watch the original ... Its still more scary and fun than this, though we are all going to watch it once ... But I saw it yesterday and quite frankly it is already disappearing from my memory Watch again ? ... No",2,7,12,1 July 2013
Mama," A complete pile of poo
","Del Toro should be ashamed of putting his name to this pile of steaming garbage ... The director and editor don't even know how to put a film together with any style whatsoever ... Everything is so obvious its untrue ... And oh yes the heroine is in a ROCK band ... I mean the whole thing is frankly embarrassing .... Its as if some producer just threw a million at one of his kids that thought being a film maker would be fun ... There's nothing new here ... Nothing visually pleasing or interesting ... No ideas .. Its a shambles ... There is the germ of an idea there that may have looked like a possibility on paper, but this bunch of imbeciles got hold of it it all went out the door Avoid at all costs ... 90 minutes of your life is far to important to waste on this rubbish",2,8,17,10 February 2013
X-Men: First Class," Absolutely Painfully Awful ... No other way to describe it
","What a joke ... It looked like some awful cheap TV spin off ... How funny to see Hugh Jackman saying what anyone with any intelligence would have said when confronted with these silly bland children trying to act like they knew what ANYTHING was about ... What a vapid crew they were Kevin Bacon walked through his part thinking 'Oh well that's a nice paycheck and I won't have to do another one : )) ' and who could blame him I thought the guy who made Kick Ass, which was at least a fresh amusing little film, would be capable of much better than this And that guy playing Xavier ... Get back to children's TV ... WHAT A FARCE Get a script ... Get rid of the director who can even make poor Jennifer Lawrence from 'Winters Bone' look like a vapid bimbo ... Get some leads who can at least reach the depths of a swimming pool rather than a mirror ... Or just forget it ... Cos the fact is you need someone with talent like Bryan Singer to bring any life to what are just comic book characters in the first place The worst of the X-Men films by far ... This makes X-Men 3 look like a masterpiece",2,3,6,11 July 2011
Mother!," Dreadfully silly, self important, failure ... On all levels
","Aronofsky wrote a ridiculous comedy horror film but didn't realise and thought it was a drama ... So we have one of the most absurd and ridiculous pieces of self important cinema that we have seen in years ... Unfortunately of course it isn't good enough to be bad enough to be funny ... What we get is a silly lot of unrealistic people floundering about in a narrative that just doesn't work in any way ... Bardem, Harris and Pfeiffer know how to act and are fine in their scenes, but the writing is so blatantly stupid that it makes no difference ... Jennifer Lawrence is ok but quite frankly she reached her peak in her early career and has made some really crap choices in the films she's chosen ... Its all been downhill since Winters Bone really ... The film just gets more and more absurd, which would be fine, if the characters were at all likeable or relatable to, but they aren't ... Personally I wish they'd all been killed off in their first scene, then I wouldn't have had to waste so much time sitting through this stinker expecting the director of 'Black Swan' ( which I loved ) to pull off something really clever and make the end a revelation ... He didn't ... Not even close",2,0,0,19 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Pointless
","It's basically just a rehash of seven scenes and story lines from the first three films ... Put together with good cgi but apparently no decent writers ... Cliché upon cliché flashes across the screen colourfully ... A load of really dull characters do the sort of things you'd expect ... The villain is a bit of a wimpy dullard ... The original cast show up for a laugh ... But really there is certainly nothing new or interesting in this ... And quite frankly, in the age of Guardians of the Galaxy, this is outmoded in every way from the outset ... Mediocre film making that feeds on geek love of the first three films ... Unfortunately these are different times and this has none of the charm or excitement of the unique original trilogy",2,33,39,11 April 2016
Cloud Atlas," Lets make something intellectual for simpletons :)
","It isn't deep ... It isn't confusing ... Its just thrown together really badly ... Has some of the worst action scenes in todays cinema ... The directors choice of using the same actors through the different time zones did nothing to help the flow and coherence of the film, it just made you question who it was till you realised ( some of the make up was well done ) but it took you right out of the film The whole thing was just really sloppy and having to sit through three hours of bad film making is frankly no sensible persons idea of time well spent ... Yes it has a beautiful idea behind it ... But not unique ... And quite frankly was communicated in just the last 30 seconds of narration rather than the three hours of sprawling mess that came before it ... Mind you even that was rather spoilt by its syrupy delivery Truly an epic failure",2,6,13,6 February 2013
Annihilation," From Ex-Machina to this non event ? ... How
","Right, lets get something clear from the start ... Theres nothing new visually or thematically or intellectually here ... It is not a deep film for anyone but middle americans ... In fact its insultingly shallow for anyone who has a decent experience of world cinema ... Yes folks most films are not made in hollywooood ... I loved Ex-Machina and thought it was one of the best ( and most intelligent ) films I'd seen in a long time ... Perhaps my expectations were too high ... But frankly this film is a mediocre piece of sci fi tv ... It is not complex ... It is not clever ... Yes she is changed at the end, she has the other girls tattoo on her arm, so what ... Her and her husband are the invaders ... They should have left the meteor shower end in ... Then at least it would have had a Invasion of the Bodysnatchers feel to it ... Its nothing more than a mediocre b movie ... I can't understand how it happened ... Was there huge studio interference ? ... Did Garland go out partying and let the caterers make the film ? ... Who knows ? ... Quite frankly I just don't care, because I won't be wasting any more of my life on that non event",2,9,18,20 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," Imbecilic Millennial Soap Opera Alien
","This film stank ... The writing could of been done by a class of 15 year old school kids ... And not terribly bright ones ... And the direction, Ridley Scott, is lame ... The effects for the most part are terrible ... And the acting is straight out of a mid afternoon Mexican Soap ... In all EVERYTHING is wrong with this film ... You can't wait for everyone to get killed just so it'll end and you can get out of the bloody cinema ... Prometheus was great visually ... The lead actress was incredibly annoying and the plot of everything the humans did was just ridiculous ... BUT it had the engineers ... Did Scott realise they were the only good thing in the whole film and carry on with something leading forward into their universe and the history that everyone was interested in ... Hell no ... We get a bit of ( very badly done and very hastily ended ) engineer backstory, and then back to whining clueless characters and bloody Michael ( dull ) Fassbender times 2 ... I'm serious ... Skip it ... This is a major embarrassment for all involved ... Alien and Aliens are great ... 3 was killed by a clueless studio ... 4 is quite fun as a chase film ... But Scott has dragged this into Star Wars Jar Jar Binks Clueless Deluded Director Territory",1,8,12,3 July 2017
The Martian," Give up Ridley ... That was bad soap opera
","Completely devoid of and character development and full of the most stupid con,septs... Yeah right ... We can catch people flying round in space ... I mean it was so obvious from the beginning what the fastest way to save him would be ... Are these writers retarded ... We know NASA is an arrogant pointless institution that needs more than a boot up its useless bum, but jeezz ... This is awful cringe worthy crap ... It sums itself up really by using Abbas Waterloo, full blast, over one of the films most important scenes ... Is Ridley Scott senile ? ... Or so bloody removed from reality, in some ivory tower that he won't realise that anyone with a brain will be laughing at him, turning out this hopeless, bad space opera drivel!!!",2,9,20,11 December 2015
