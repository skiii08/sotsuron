The Blair Witch Project," Wow!
","Nowadays good horror films are a dying breed. Fortunately, 'the Blair Witch Project' came along just in time to renew my faith in horror films. The only thing that could have made this movie scarier was if it really was real. It certainly did look real. The performances were quite believable, which gives me the impression that the actors really were that scared. I don't quite know how to put into words just how good or scary this movie is. . .The review from the trailer that say 'the creepiest film since 'the Exorcist'!' is quite an accurate one. . .In fact, if I may, I'd like to take it a step further and say that this movie is even scarier than 'the Exorcist'. Yes, you read right. This movie certainly is making me question my faith in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' as the best film ever made. I suppose I can't think of anything else to say about this movie. If you want a scare, you'll get it. If your in for a laugh...Well, you'll actually be able to get that too. Just not as much. Dare I say it (I hate phrases like this) but this is a 'must-see' for a true horror fan.",10,1,2,31 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," A stroke of ironic genius.
","Trey Parker and Matt Stone created a monster in 1997 with the release of 'South Park'. Very few films based on TV shows are as good as the show (Beavis and Butt-Head do America comes to mind), but 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut' really is a great movie. And believe it or not parents, this movie has a message! It says that nobody notices violence and perversion, but profanity is just a disgrace. As George Carlin says, 'No bad words. Bad thoughts, bad intentions, and words.' The words don't matter. It's the motivation behind them. When Cartman says 'What's the big f**kin' deal, bitch?' He's basically addressing my exact thoughts. Why do parents care if their kids say the f-word? I bet a lot of the kids who are 'protected' from this movie will end up in an asylum if not a state prison. This truly was ironic genius, because they get their message out, and they keep their gimmicks (i.e. 'Oh my God! They killed Kenny!) intact. Sheer genius. They manage to get your attention and hold it. Granted, not as long as Saving Private Ryan, but still, South Park's message is more original. I love this movie.",10,0,0,20 July 1999
The Doors," Good movie, but not really accurate.
","Being a huge fan of the Doors (and Jim Morrison), I was expecting the film.. .Well, I don't really know what I expected. I guess I was expecting a good film. I got what I was looking for. However, this film completely distorted my view of Jim Morrison's personality. In the film, he's portrayed (quite well, might I add) by Val Kilmer as a drunk and a junkie. Granted, when he wasn't stoned he was usually drunk, but the film doesn't point out his good qualities. Few and far between though they may be, they were still there. He wasn't just a musical genius A-Hole. He was supposedly a nice guy when he was sober. If you want to learn about Jim Morrison, read No One Here Gets Out Alive. If you want a really great film with hardly any historical accuracy, rent 'The Doors.' If for nothing other than the incredible soundtrack. Of course, perhaps I'm a little biased. As I mentioned, I'm a huge fan of the Doors. I guess so, because otherwise I wouldn't have cared to see the movie. But I digress. Oh, I guess not because I'm done.",8,1,1,25 July 1999
The Shining," Kubrick does it again.
","The odd thing about Stanley Kubrick is that he can make a film exactly like the book it's based on (A Clockwork Orange, another favorite of mine) but he can also make a film that goes completely away from the book. The Shining was not only the first Stephen King movie I had ever seen, it was the first horror film I had ever seen. And thus far, it is the only horror film on the same level of scariness as the Exorcist and Psycho that I know of. Two names make this a great film. Any true movie fan should know these names. Kubrick and Nicholson. Let's start with Nicholson, shall we? Jack Nicholson is, simply put, the best actor ever. He portrays Jack Torrence better than anyone else ever could. Well, that was simple. OK, now let's move on to Stanley Kubrick, shall we? His vision of the future in A Clockwork Orange and his vision of outer space in 2001: A Space Oddessy are without rival, as is his vision of schizophrenia, alcoholism, parenthood, and insanity in the Shining. Well, maybe they're rivaled by Psycho and the Exorcist. But that's it. This film is a must-see for any horror movie junkie. But if you want Kubrick at his best, I suggest A Clockwork Orange. But that's just my opinion.",9,0,0,20 July 1999
A Clockwork Orange," A stroke of sheer genius.
","Most films today are not particularly good. Every once in a while a film comes along that can be called satisfactory and on a very, very rare occasion pretty good. How I long for the days when a film such as A Clockwork Orange could come along and shock a viewer into agreeing with the characters on screen. The most recent example of this that I can think of is the South Park movie. Perhaps I've seen this film too many times to comment very well on it, but I'll try anyway.Stanley Kubrick can do things no other director can. He can trick you into thinking. The first time I saw this movie I was thinking and didn't even know it! Truly, this is the first film that ever really made me think. Some people think that this movie is just rape, assault, and murder. Nothing could be further from the truth. This movie has an anti-government theme, and there are few things I respect more than anti-government themes. Well, what else can I say about this movie that hasn't been said a thousand times before? I really liked it, and I think it's a shame that Eyes Wide Shut will be Stanley Kubrick's last movie. But, that's just me.",10,0,0,25 July 1999
Carrie," Doesn't live up to the book.
","I'm the kind of person who will watch a movie and THEN read the book. I realize that's not a good thing, but it's just the kind of guy I am. I saw Carrie before I read Stephen King's novel. When I saw the movie, I thought nothing could rival the spectacle of Brian DePalma's 'Carrie' Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie give incredible performances. Granted, it was slow moving at times, but I liked it. But then I read the book. The book has something that the movie doesn't, and I am absolutely clueless as to what it is. The stones. I think it was the stones. Anyone who's read the book will know what I'm talking about. Don't get me wrong. This was by no means a bad film. I'm just saying the book is better. I realize that's true of every movie based on a book, but this book just completely blew my mind. Read the book, then see the movie. Don't worry, it's short for a Stephen King book. Books don't get much better than Stephen King's Carrie. But that's just my opinion.",Null,0,0,20 July 1999
The Breakfast Club," Something for everyone
","The Breakfast Club is a movie that can speak to anyone. By that I don't mean you will find a character just like you or anything. I know I didn't. But, I think the movie has some qualities that can make everyone like it. Judging by other reviews I'd assume that's pretty much true. First, you have detention. Something pretty much everyone has done before. Next, you have one of the factors that made the Shining a great movie, that kind of 'no way out' setting. And third you have 5 people who can't get along in an enclosed space for a long period of time. Put them together and here you have the Breakfast Club. This movie will speak to anyone who is or ever was a teenager. I particularly liked Brian's essay in the end. My one problem with this movie: Why were they called the Breakfast Club? I'm sure there's some reasonable explanation that I missed because I'm stupid, but, oh well. Great flick. Watch it if you haven't already.",10,0,1,22 August 1999
