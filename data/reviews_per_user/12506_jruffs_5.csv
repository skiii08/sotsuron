Hereditary," It should not be classed in the horror genre
","I saw the trailers, I was impressed by them, such mystery and atmosphere they gave little away, started watching it tonight and we gave up after 45 minutes, it's a drama about a grieving family, now please don't get me wrong I enjoy a well made, well acted drama, but when something is marketed as a horror, with a character development that makes me care less about them, the enjoyment factor disipates, now I did find there was an eerie atmosphere about the film, it was directed in a way which was complimented by a fitting soundtrack to create tension, but that wasn't enough by itself to keep me interested, partially due to the hype, I am probably unjustly overly disappointed, to the point I gave it only 3 stars",3,2,6,6 March 2019
The Mummy," Great films
","I love the Mummy films, 1 and 2, highly enjoyable, the action, the period, the story, Rick O'Connell's gun bag, it's all good fun.I recently rewatched them, still enjoyed them both.",7,0,1,17 December 2018
Bird Box," Tense as Hell
","I found the trailer very appealing, but honestly I was expecting another disappointing end (or lack of) like The Circle or Hold the Dark and many other Netflix Originals.In this instance though, I didn't care, both myself and my Mrs were on the edge of our seats hoping the main characters would all make it.Very well made, very well directed, lots of atmosphere and tense moments throughout, great film overall.",7,1,3,22 December 2018
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Great film, entertaining franchise
","I love the ResiEvil films, the entire franchise is just pure entertainment, granted, starting with Apocalypse they moved away from the horror and further into action sci-fi but it's not a bad thing.RE Apocalypse starts off directly after the events of the first movie, there's a little flashback narrative by Milla Jovovich to fill in the questions for anyone skipping the first film, apocalypse upped the action by 70% and added more characters from the games like Jill Valentine to the movie franchise, lots of martial arts and gunplay throughout the film, it's good fun.If you like zombies, action, hot women, guns, sci-fi etc then you'll enjoy the ResiEvil series.",7,5,7,18 December 2018
The Last Samurai," This made me Not hate Tom Cruise.
","I was never a fan of Tom Cruise, I found all his 90s films rather subpar and rather unexceptional, Interview With A Vampire I obviously enjoyed, but otherwise I found him to be pretty average and not fitting the A List category.
Then I watched The Last Samurai, I was blown away by it, all of it, the direction, the soundtrack, the story and script, the character of Captain Nathan Algrin and his battles with PTSD and guilt, Tom's performance was fantastic, you really feel for the character, as a result it straight away became one of my favourite films.
I recommend this film to anyone, even my gran liked it.8/10",8,1,3,7 March 2019
