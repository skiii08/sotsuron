Ali," A boxer stays a boxer.
","This movie is probably Will smiths best movie. Will smith is a brilliant actor. He plays the legendary boxer Muhammad Ali. I expected more of a boxing movie but it was more about religion and Alis life outside of boxing. Muhammad Ali was a Muslim and he worshiped Elijah Muhammad. Elijah Muhammad was the leader of nation of Islam, and Muhammad Ali wanted to spread hes message thru boxing. Muhammad Ali was a smart boxer, he made hes opponents angry before the match by teasing them and calling them names. This is a movie you probably have to see, probably one of my favorite movies. 'Floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee. You're hands cant hit what you're eyes cant see'Don't EVER forget the legend of Muhammad Ali",9,1,2,8 March 2009
Spider-Man 3," A spider fail...
",Im a real huge fan of spider man really... I've watched the TV series sense i was like 6 years old. But this movie really sucked. compared to the first and second this ain't even a spider man movie. This movie seems more like a video game. It started of OK but then the fighting scenes were not as good as spider man 1 or 2. The ending was really horrible like they were running out of time. I really expected more from this movie because spider man is the best super hero. This movie was HARDLY watchable its a movie you can watch but in the end say OK. Last thing i wanna say is i hope they don't make spider man 4 the same way i really hope they can turn it around.,5,0,2,8 March 2009
