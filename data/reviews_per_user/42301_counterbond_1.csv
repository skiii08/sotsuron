","I'm not sure what to think about this movie, because I watched it with a couple of people who had done drugs in their lives and well...pretty much when i was confused at the end and said wow...that was kind of a dumb movie(of course i didn't read the summary before watching) but yea..the answer to me reply from my friends was.... 'you have to watch this movie when your on something...' there it is...makes a lot of sense to me...i dunno..maybe its just to show how dumb drugs are to people who haven't tried them...but they slipped up and didn't realize that it would cause people to smoke or do drugs while watching the movie for it to make more sense?
