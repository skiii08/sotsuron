"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Sparkling cuvée, attempting to imitate champagne
","many superlatives have been thrown at this film, many sycophantic accolades. In my opinion, it is an attempt to cut through, a bold, and even adventurous exercise in film story telling. the sad reality is that it is a failure in honest theatrical terms.Like a sparkling cuvée, it is imbued with effervescent enthusiasm, but its pedigree lacks the finesse of the champagne it attempts to imitate, and, not surprisingly, it conveys very little taste.The direction is stilted and obvious, even clunky at times; the acting, with one, and occasionally two notable exceptions, rates from bold to over the top, and the dialogue suffers from poor scripting and unrefined delivery. Like many (alas too many) Australian films, it is a work based upon a script devoid of a good story, which is competently shot (although in this case containing some technical errors of judgement) but rather over enthusiastically played out. PQD is like the outpourings of an amateur theatre troupe, hell bent upon having fun, strutting their individual stuff, and playing for laughs.",4,2,10,5 March 2016
In Bruges," Brilliant writing, a work that comes within an inch of true greatness.
","This film walks in its own way, and with the exception of one or two alcoves or nooks and crannies, it walks along new roads and byways.I wanted so strongly to give this picture 10 out of 10, but it was spoiled by two very silly and deeply regrettable scenes. I say regrettable, because they were so foolishly overlooked, and so easily fixable, that I can never imagine why they were allowed to remain in the finished product. One could have been omitted altogether, the other re shot very simply. The first is the lunatic scene with the so called overweight American tourists, this was like a bad moment in Screwballs or Dumb and Dumber, and should never have happened at all, given that it did happen, it would not have harmed the story in any way to have committed it to the canvas bag or to the cutting room floor. The second regrettable scene was in the restaurant, when, for some reason best known to the director, the direction takes on an amateur theatrical or painting by numbers technique. She exits to go to the ladies room, he blows smoke and an arrogant diner complains, he snaps it and calls the diner by inviting him to repeat his complaint, this leads to an over injection of testosterone on both sides, they stand, punches are thrown, and the hero decks the diner, his date then swings a bottle and he decks her, the table breaks away, as many a card table did in the old westerns, and both decked characters remain decked, she returns from ladies room (right on cue)just in time to clock the situation; to this point, nobody has stopped eating, the waiters are all out the back having a smoke, and the restaurant manager has gone for a Pee, or is taking a shower in the next building, because nobody attempts to stop the fight, or even pay it the slightest attention. In order to avoid any further collapse in the suspension of disbelief, the director cuts to 'exterior night two' and the couple out in the street walking away from the restaurant. The time that would have been saved by cutting the Fat Tourist scene, could well have been used to support the utterly unbelievable restaurant scene.Such a shame, because the film is a beauty, and the combined efforts of all concerned in this production, have provided the world with a work of nearly true greatness.Regards, Dracher",8,1,3,24 January 2009
Inglourious Basterds," A work of theatrical and entertainment genius
","A brief comment is all that is required. Inglorious Basterds is a work of genius, it has been crafted by a man who knows film, who knows theatricality and story telling and who has the drive to take a medium to another place, another level, without saying 'look at my genius, what a great film maker I am'.Here is a work of fantasy that grabs its audience early and, in a world saturated with images and movies, it manages to hold on to its audience and thoroughly entertain them for nearly three hours.Every work of greatness has its flaw, its crack in the smooth plaster and in the case of Inglorious Basterds, it is what I consider the miscasting of Mike Myers, who gives his tiny role, the most obviously cod performance imaginable. I can only assume that he has worked under his own direction for too long.",10,1,6,28 December 2009
