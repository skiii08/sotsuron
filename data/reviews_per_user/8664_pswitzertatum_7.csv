Skyfall," Derivative Drivel
","My husband and I saw this so-called Bond film, and while we both appreciate Daniel Craig as an actor, we do not think he is James Bond in any way. We adore Judi Dench and thought she was great, and we are sorry to see her go. I for one was not so sure that the fine actor Ralph Fiennes is a good substitute for her. Javier Bardem was suitably menacing as the villain. In this film there were way too many echoes of The Bourne Identity and Jason Bourne, which is too bad because because that Bourne series is much more clever and innovative overall, but this film seemed like 'The Boring Identity' to us. While the ending was somewhat spectacular, we felt that the whole Skyfall back story was not very well done. It looked like Wuthering Heights. We were amused at least to see Voldemort and Mrs. Malfoy on a political panel together!",6,4,9,16 March 2013
The Incredibles," A fun feature with a great designer
","My husband and I went to see this film because our grandson loved it and talks of Dash and Violet as though they were his best buddies. He is four, so we were not exactly sure of our interest, but were happily rewarded. We enjoyed the fast-paced animation and clever digital antics of the lively and well-developed characters. The family is a good bunch of superheroes. But the best part of this very entertaining film, for me, was the designer of costumes for the Incredibles. He/she is a truly hilarious character with overtones of Edith Head, a little Coco Chanel, a dash of Kenzo, and a tiny bit of Linda Hunt in Robert Altman's comedy 'Pret-A-Porter (Ready to Wear).' It's worth seeing the film just to watch this wickedly sly send-up. 'NO cape!'",8,1,3,30 December 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Timely and riveting
","'Good Night and Good Luck' is a timely lesson about honest and brave journalism in the '50s, personified by Edward R. Murrow and Fred Friendly in a dark time in our history. The film is effectively shot in black and white for verisimilitude. The staging and pacing were also very effective in telling the story. I was especially impressed with David Strathairn's acting as Murrow, supported by George Clooney ( who co-wrote and directed) as Friendly. Other actors and actresses did well in their roles, also, such as Frank Langella and Jeff Daniels. A few parts seemed a little obscure to me, but did not detract from the essential story. The use of actual newsreels of the time was interesting and useful in setting the scene. While this movie may not be everyone's cup of tea as entertainment, I think it is well worth seeing on the big screen.",10,1,2,21 October 2005
Selma," Solid film with a riveting performance by David O as MLK Jr.
","My husband and I saw this well-done film at a screening this evening. I found it totally absorbing as well as extremely painful to watch, but realize what I felt was nothing compared to the racist brutality inflicted on the peaceful marchers in this portrayal. David O gives a riveting performance as MLK Jr., so that to me is one of the most important reasons to watch the film. It's also an honest depiction of our history that should be seen by people of all races. Although the pacing is sometimes slow and a bit wooden in places, this could be the perfect technique to use as counterpoint to the portrayal of the explosive violence and viciousness that the peaceful protesters must endure. We found most of the acting to be excellent, such as the actors who played Coretta Scott King, John Lewis, Andrew Young, and President Johnson, but a few of the actors cast did not seem correct at all: Tim Roth was excellent playing an evil racist, but he did not seem to me to be Wallace as I remember him. And the actor who played J Edgar Hoover was laughable in that role.",8,11,26,6 January 2015
Super 8," What happened?!
","My husband and I went to see this after one of our kids said they enjoyed it. We sure wanted to like it. After viewing the film however, enjoy is not exactly a word we could really use of our experience, but we certainly thought there was some fine acting by several of the young people in the movie, especially the lead boy and the girl, the film-maker boy and the fire cracker kid. There was a lot of exciting but confusing action in the story and not enough emphasis on filling us in (as far as we could see) as to what the 'alien' had been through in captivity on Earth - so to us the very valid point of view of the alien and his sympathetic scientist-friend seemed lost in the shuffle for the most part. We had a lot of questions such as what exactly was the alien doing with those humans he captured? And why did the space ship fall apart into cubes? And what is the relationship between the magnetic issues and the water tower? This made the end a bit puzzling, although it tried hard to be poignant. The plot sort of reminded me of a 'Star Trek' episode where mining operations were interrupted on a planet because a 'monster' was killing the miners, until Spock did a 'mind-meld' with the 'beast' and found out it was a desperate mother trying to protect her children in their eggs. She would stop killing and help the miners get the ore they wanted from the shells, if they'd stop killing her babies.",Null,0,1,9 July 2011
The Da Vinci Code," A good run after a good read
","I think this film version of Dan Brown's NOVEL was better than I had been hearing about but not as good as I expected after all the hoopla around it. It's still a wild ride and provocative story with some interesting film-making techniques, and some not so great editing. In some ways it is better than the book, such as at specific parts portrayed at the ending, but so much explanatory stuff is left out, I really think one has to read the book first to 'get' much of what happens in the film. While not any masterpiece, the novel was a good read, so that's not a waste of time. However, if one wants the real meat of the controversy, I think reading Holy Blood, Holy Grail and The Templar Revelation, or The Holy Place, are some of the best places to start. By the end of the film I was enchanted with Audrey Tatou, who for the most part was wasted in what is supposed to be a pivotal role. I love Tom Hanks, but thought he looked uncomfortable much of the time in his role. Ian McKellen is flat-out brilliant as Teabing. I found the film for the most part, like the novel, sort of 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail Lite,' but still an inspiration for continued spiritual seeking and searching and strengthening of belief in God, not one iota of blasphemy toward God of any sort. Then again, it still makes me question the power and validity of institutional church propaganda no matter what. The film is worth seeing, but certainly not worth boycotting.",8,2,5,22 May 2006
Moonrise Kingdom," A Wonderful and Quirky Film
","My husband and I really enjoyed this quirky and charming film. We thought the acting was quite good all around, especially the lead kids. The locations are wonderful. The plot is wonderfully twisted and strangely fascinating. It has intriguing background 'bits of business' that are fun to watch. It made us think of a dysfunctional American Harry Potter and Hermione Granger together in love at last on their own adventure, running away from their prescribed roles. Sam is even an orphan. Suzy's parents aren't both dentists, but they are both lawyers. All of the great adult actors in odd and amusing parts even seemed like the litany of British actors who filled up the Potter movies. We wondered about the books Susy read aloud (she seemed like Wendy with the lost boys) and who wrote them. We can hardly wait to see it again, and to see the DVD when it comes out, so we can slow it down and look at it like a storybook.",10,3,6,16 October 2012
