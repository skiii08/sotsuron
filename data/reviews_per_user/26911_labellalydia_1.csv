The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," My opinion:a great movie
","I don't get why people are giving their best shot to be mean with their reviews... I think that a movie can never be as good as the book,as long as we talk about a good book... The problem with Twilight Saga is that because of it's fame everybody feels the need to say his opinion about each movie even if it's not their taste...I mean I would never say my opinion or write a review about a drama movie or a documentary.I don't like this kind of movies so whatever I say I'm gonna be unfair... The same happens with this case...People,old ones,who logically don't like teen movies are writing as bad reviews as they can... People it's not for your age!Of course you have the right to watch it, but let the people who like this kind of movies to rate it.Cause I'm pretty sure that you don't judge the effects and the way it was directed but it's plot... I happen to like the books and I think that Breaking Dawn was Great!The screen writer managed to follow the book and in some scenes made it really funny...And I loved all the intensive scenes!All in all it's a great movie,for those who like this kind of movies,and it doesn't disappoint the fans of the books.",10,16,37,17 November 2011
