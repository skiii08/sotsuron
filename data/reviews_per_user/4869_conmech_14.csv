Deja Vu," VERY Exciting
","The only thing I knew about this movie was that it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, which is more than an enough reason to rent it. The director was Tony Scott, the director of 'Enemy of Nation' which entertained and 'Spy Game' which totally bored me. But this movie is like nothing else. Because; 1) The subject is very original, no you can't guess what it's about by looking at the name. Don't worry it's not some freaky Shyamalan type of movie. I have watched quite a lot movies and can easily say this was a first. Oh of course there WILL be many people who will rise up saying 'this can't happen in real life'. Yeah, and Godzilla can't happen either, so were you there to criticize that too? It's not a matter of 'can it happen' or not, it's a matter of 'does it make sense', and hell yes it does! It's so hard not to give spoilers, so all I can say is, just hold on for half an hour, and everything will start making sense.2) Unlike many other high budget action movies, this movie IS exciting. Don't wanna give spoilers, but when you grab what the movie is about, you will realize it doesn't necessarily have a happy ending, and that's what keeps you on the edge all the time.3) Needless to say, the producer is Jerry Bruckheimer so everything's gonna be BIG and EXPENSIVE, cars and ships and buildings blowing up in an eye feast.So as a conclusion, I can say Mr. Bruckheimer is getting even better by adding excitement to his high budget movies.",9,1,2,6 January 2008
Fight Club," The Best Movie Ever Made
","When I entered IMDb.com the first thing I did was to check if anyone actually disliked this movie. And YES, there are people who gave the movie one star. This is a proof that every movie can be disliked by SOMEONE in the world, because Fight Club is with no argument the best movie ever made. It's the best combination of a great writer, great director, great actors, great music makers. And the outcome is a movie which needs to be watched 7-8 times to understand it. I watched it probably more than 8 times, and I still discover something new in the movie. Maybe a hidden frame, or an important word or sentence which I couldn't understand before. The enjoyment you'll get by watching it once is limited. You will like the movie more and more every time u see it and finally think it is the best movie ever made. There's no end to depth of the movie. And to my surprise, for the first time I see a movie is BETTER than its novel. The script writer took the novel, converted it into a movie script removing the boring and dull parts, and made it ready for an outstanding movie. This is actually why u need to watch it several times, because EVERY word, EVERY sentence has a meaning and no time and no line is wasted in the movie.If you're a movie lover, you have probably seen this movie. My advice is, watch it again, and again, and again...",10,3,8,16 November 2007
Cloverfield," A First of its Kind Â– Believe it or Not
","I had always thought about a movie where they use Blair Witch handy-cam style shooting combined with high quality CGI. I dreamed of it, they made it. First of all, I love the idea that it was shot over a tape which was shot previously, so we can see from time to time what was in the tape previously. Secondly, it's a great way of shooting a Godzilla-type movie, cause you can see the panic and the chaos from every angle. From the normal people having party, all the way to seeing it above from the helicopter. It really made me feel I'm in that chaotic place and gave me the terror from the first hand. I still can't figure out how they managed to add CGI effects to a moving, zooming and auto-focusing camera. It must have been so hard for them. The only strange part was we never got to see the camera and it was shooting in standard movie quality without a filter. But that must be for the visual quality's sake. It would look so crappy if they used a real camcorder or something. I also like the movies like this one where they set up the place and act in it in a single long shoot, like the masterpiece 'Children of Men'.Something else I wanna say about this movie is, it's a radical one. So you either love it or hate it. Of course some people are going to hate it cause they don't like the style. But they don't have the right to say it's a bad movie just because they don't understand it. It's like someone who doesn't like rap saying Eminem sucks.",9,0,1,11 July 2008
28 Weeks Later," A Beautiful Piece of Art
","I always had the feeling this was just going to be a lame sequel using the name of the classic movie '28 Days Later'. Mainly because '28 Days Later' had a good ending where infected die of starvation and everything was going to be OK. So looking at the trailer, you might feel cheated to have watched '28 Days Later', cause things just don't seem to turn out OK after all. But you would be wrong. '28 Weeks Later' isn't an 'Elm Street' type sequel where evil just comes back for no good reason. As in most horror sequels, '28 Weeks Later' takes its own horror elements to the next level. I don't wanna give any spoilers, so all I can say is everything is more intense than '28 Days Later' The shooting of the film is just beautiful. The use of filters, lighting, fast camera movement, empty city scenes, and music make this movie a true piece of art. You will realize that it actually is a good thing the sequel has a different director, so you will get a chance to see the idea of '28 Days Later' from a different point of view. '28 Days Later' & '28 Weeks Later' is probably one of the best horror couple ever made, since each of them is a whole different movie in itself with only the idea of infected people in common. The only downside of the movie was it felt too short. It was probably the quickest 90 minutes of my life. This actually IS a downside, because it leaves the viewer dissatisfied. Most characters have longer backgrounds than their lives in the movie. And the overall of the movie gives you the feeling that it was cut short due to lack of budget (probably). Nevertheless, '28 Weeks Later' is a must see for horror addicts, and it definitely is better than some of the classic movies of modern time.",9,2,4,7 November 2007
Warrior," Don't Watch The Trailer - And Don't Read the Plot on IMDb
","I get that companies have to show some cool stuff to attract the audience. But the trailer gives some key plot elements (as does the 'PLOT' section on IMDb), as well as some MAJOR SPOILERS. For the first time, we have a movie, where there are 2 protagonists and 2 antagonists, which means the final fight, and the winner is not determined, and could be anyone. The only problem is, they show A LOT on the trailer, that you pretty much know how the end will be. Just watch it without the trailer, IMO finally we have a more evolved version of Rocky here.",9,5,7,30 August 2017
Shrek the Third," Did the Writer Change?
","The first thing I did after watching this movie was enter IMDb.com and check if the writer has changed for 'Shrek the Third'. Surprisingly, it's the same story writer, which is a shame. Compared to 'Shrek' and 'Shrek 2', 'Shrek the Third' is very shallow, both on the story and on the humor. When 'Shrek' had a sequel, I was suspicious that it might be hiding behind the fame of the first movie, but I was wrong. I had enjoyed 'Shrek 2' more than the first movie. Even though the first movie pretty much ended in a happily ever after way, the story of the second movie was even better than the first one, and more exciting in my opinion. So I was expecting the third to be better than both 1 and 2, but it just looks like a bad imitation of Shrek movies made by another company.5 stars is only for the greatness of the animation. You can see how incredibly the technology of animation has evolved. But there's still no technology in the world which can make such a boring movie exciting. This is not just an animation movie, this is 'Shrek', and it HAD to be funny and exciting. As I said before, there's no depth in the story. Not even logic. OK it may be an animation, it may be about fairy tales, it may be a comedy movie, but still it had to have some credibility and originality on the story for us to stick ourselves onto. The loser prince decides to take over the city, he enters the villain bar, convinces everyone to attack and terrorizes the whole city with a bar of bad guys, and even becomes a king. Also, the fairy tale spoofs were no better than before, if not weaker.Many people say a third movie is too much for Shrek, but I disagree. It could still be fun, even better than the old ones, because Shrek is a very open story which anything can be added to. But disappointingly, instead of thinking of a new story, the writer has stretched the story of Shrek 2 to a point of boredom and lameness. I mean, it could have been Prince Charming and the villains become good too and fight against a greater evil, for the sake of taking things to a new level, this evil could be from outside the fairy world altogether. Look I wrote a better story than the actual one in 5 minutes.",5,0,1,2 December 2007
Transformers," Good movie, but definitely less than I expected...
","I waited for months for this movie to come out and I expected A lot from it. And it wasn't my fault doing so, before it came out two of my favorite directors, Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay said: 'This movie is going to blow you away'. I mean, they're Michael Bay and Spielberg. Also the trailer was amazing, giving the feeling the movie is going to be a cool, action packed, serious movie, and not like an episode from the cartoon. And it DID start as an awesome movie; a helicopter that was supposed to be a wreck comes out of nowhere, transforms and attacks with incredible visual effects. The next robot scene with the scorpion robot was also awesome, and until that moment I was so glad that I finally have another movie which I can buy and watch over and over again. But when the robots started to talk, things started going down. They lost all their coolness thanks to stupid conversations, the visual effects got somewhat worse and there came a moment where the camera just started moving around too fast to hide the flaws in the visual effects. And worst of all, Michael Bay HAD TO put his classic cheap humour from 'Bad Boys II' or 'Pearl Harbour' to this movie as well. I'm sorry but, most things robots do or the guy says is not funny, they're just boring parts to make the movie look longer. And HOW did Bumblebee start talking again? I thought it was only in ancient Turkish movies where people recover from major handicaps by getting hit by a car, blind people start seeing, deaf people start hearing. There's also a part which I looked up in the Goofs section but couldn't find it. When the robots were asked how they learned English they say 'from the internet'. But they had to come down all the way near a car store and look at the vehicles to analyse in order to disguise like them. Why didn't they just check the internet for incredible amount of information about any type of vehicle? I never like looking for mistakes in a movie and I try to enjoy as much as I can but, this is just humiliating the audience. Definitely less than what I expect from Michael Bay. Nevertheless I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 cause the good scenes are REALLY good, and they manage to make the movie a 'must-see'.",8,0,2,9 November 2007
Children of Men," I'm in Love With This Movie
","I watched this movie right after '300', and felt like cleaning my mouth with fresh water after eating something with a bad taste. This movie is probably one of the best of its kind, if not one-of-a-kind. A good movie always keeps one of your emotions at its peak while watching it, it can be fear, joy, excitement, even misery. What I felt watching this movie was admiration.Now I would simply say 'No need for words, go and watch it' but I wanna be different than the haters of this movie who cannot say anything about why they didn't like it. Actually, I intentionally searched for haters because I wanted to see what is there that someone can dislike. There are apparently many 1 stars, but they can't go further than saying 'I want my money back'.So I will tell you why I loved it. The foremost reason was the directing. There was definitely more work in the movie than many CGI loaded ones. Some scenes were shot as a big chunk of 10-15 minutes, and they were the hardest and most exciting scenes. Watch out for especially 3 scenes. 1) Where the characters try to runaway with a car which doesn't start and it's going downhill 2) The inside car scene where terrorists intercept the car and attack them 3) And of course the final scene where Clive Owen is trying to get inside a building under heavy battle.All these scenes were shot as big blocks which I couldn't understand how they were shot. Of course the director probably did it the hard way, set everything up, set the timing, and tried the same scene for tens of times until everything went smoothly. This is not all, the choice of places and setting up the scenes were brilliant. It wasn't covered with filters or heavy background music or ever-changing angles so it successfully made me feel I was there with them, in that forest, on that hill, in that car, in that building. I think Hollywood directors have a lot to learn from this movie just by watching it. The second reason is the brilliant acting. Audience like me don't understand much from good acting but if the characters make me forget that this is just a movie and if I have have real feelings for them, this MUST be good acting. My favorites are Jasper and Kee. I would give more details but I don't wanna give any spoilers.And I can't believe even the story was hated by some people. This movie has got exactly what a good sci-fi should have. You stick to all laws of reality, you change just one of them, and predict the reactions. This movie does this perfectly. The fact that it doesn't have a lot of CGI makeup makes the movie even more believable.Final statement, brilliant work of art. Especially if you are interested in directing or movie-making you cannot afford to miss this movie. It will blow you away...",9,6,21,19 November 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The Disappointment Grows Ever More
","I'm considering the fact that the movies should be graded according to their own structure and not to their loyalty to their novels. And because the directing is fine, visual effects are good, actors are very strong, and the story is still interesting although it's the 5th episode, I think this movie deserves an 8 out of 10.However, I must sat this is a HUGE disappointment for the book readers like me. I think the best adaptations were episode 1 and 2. Episode 3 was worse, 4 was worse than that. 5 is the worst adaptation by far. There were so many scenes in our heads (like the OWL exams where Harry makes charms in front of teachers, or Quidditch) which were taken out. I believe they don't have the right to kill the book like that. They could have made 2 movies, or simply make the movie 2 and a half hours. But of course they wouldn't, cause we Harry Potter fans were going to watch it no matter what, so why bother right?",7,1,2,6 January 2008
Blood Diamond," Still Wanna Buy That Diamond Ring?
","Blood Diamond is the perfect movie which pokes in your eyes how many lives it takes to buy that piece of 'shiny stone'. Since the diamond market is definitely a huge one, at the end of the movie there is a text which tries to encourage us to buy 'clean diamond'. Why buy diamond at all? Even apes don't try to seduce their females with shiny rocks. Anyway, 'Blood Diamond' is not just a movie limited with a good story, it is packed with good acting and good quality action scenes. In my opinion the most memorable scene was where little children get drugged and become killers, giving themselves English nicknames, like 'I am, master of disaster', 'I am, see me no more' I had watched 'Lord of War' right before this movie. Those bloody diamonds are what two movies have in common and I think both of them must be seen. There's definitely a huge amount of work put in the movie, sometimes I was feeling I was the director and getting exhausted just watching the movie. And it definitely has the most important aspect of a masterpiece; when the movie is over, you just wanna restart the DVD and watch it all over again.",10,2,3,8 November 2007
Saw," Best Thriller Ever!!!
","In the recent years, the horror movies have evolved and finally stopped trying to 'scare' the audience. No matter how gory, loud or jumpy a movie is, it is almost impossible to scare an intellectual scary movie enthusiast with clown dolls or simple ghost stories, because he's just seen tens of them. Because of this fact, the new generation of horror movies entertain the viewer with either the element of 'surprise & shock' (like 'Identity', 'Others') or 'beautiful shooting & fx' (like 'Dawn of the Dead', '28 Days Later'). 'SAW' uses the 'surprise' element, and does it all the way to make me say 'Holy CRAP!' out loud. The plot is beautifully written, makes you more curious by each second that passes by, and fully satisfies the horror-lover in the end. Furthermore it does all these with a budget of 1 million dollars and an inexperienced director! Indeed there will probably be wannabe intellectual people who will try to find flaws in it or tell they don't like it, just to create controversy and to look different. Other than that, I can't imagine any horror/thriller lover dislike this movie.",10,1,2,1 November 2007
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A Solid Statue of Hollywood cheesiness...
","Even though I rated this movie 3 out of 10, it still is a 'must rent & see with your friends' type of movie, for it's the proof that only Hollywood has the magical power to combine two good and VERY famous actors, spend millions of dollars and create a colossal ZERO out of it. It has almost all the clichés you can expect from a cheesy action movie, shooters never managing to hit 2 immobile targets, assassins caring about how stylish they look more than staying alive (knowing the fact that they are the main characters and can't be shot), tons of bullets and explosives managing to trigger no adrenaline rush in the audience whatsoever, nothing given new to characters by actors; Brad Pitt is the same tough & humorous vagabond just like his other 10000 movies and Angeline Jolie is the same old Lara Croft. I know it's disrespectful to say so many bad things about someone's work, but hey, give me Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and just a couple of million dollars and see what 'I' can do.",4,0,5,7 November 2007
Lord of War," Masterpiece
","'Lord of War' is a masterpiece which can be enjoyed by audience from all tastes. It perfectly tells the relation between guns, terrorists, governments and money, gives you lots of useful information about guns and history of war. It tells how someone can become incredibly rich by only selling guns, to governments, to terrorists, to armies. However, what made this movie a masterpiece in my opinion is combining this great plot with outstanding scenes and unique shooting styles. My two favorite moments of the film were Yuri looking at a guerrilla shooting with AK-47 and hearing the ka-ching sound of money every time he shoots out a bullet, and the time lapse of Yuri's plane getting stripped off overnight just like a small mammal eaten away by ants. On almost every scene you just can't help but wonder how much work and effort they put in a single movie. I congratulate all of its makers for this piece of art. Well done...",9,4,7,7 November 2007
Sin City," Probably a good movie, but I'm too stupid to understand it.
","OK you may call me an idiot or at least non-intellectual for not liking this movie, but I'm sorry, that's how I feel. And since everyone else loved it, I guess it's me who doesn't understand from good movies.First of all it's not a full length movie, it's three non-related stories that were forced to be related to each other so that three of them could make one movie. As I said before, it's just me, who just can't enjoy watching 'amores perros' type of movie where the writer writes three-four short stories and tries to relate them to make a movie out of them.Secondly, I know it's me again, but I got extremely bored and was surprised how such a violent movie can be boring. There's not much to say about a movie if u keep looking at the time while watching. I really believe this movie was famous and liked just because of its famous director Robert Rodriguez. Like for example, 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' was a hundred times better, giving that dark 'comic book' atmosphere on every scene.And I don't wanna talk about the non-needed weirdness of the movie, like the devil looking guy who we don't have any idea why he looks like that. I don't wanna talk about it cause it probably has an explanation only the comic-fans know. But what the hell, even the 'Fantastic Four' movie had come up with explanations with the heroes' ridiculous super powers.",6,0,4,16 November 2007
