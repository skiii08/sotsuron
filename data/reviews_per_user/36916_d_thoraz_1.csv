Ford v Ferrari," FORD=First On Race Day
",Great movie with a great cast! Shows the origin of the Ford GT40 and the initial struggles Ford and Carol Shelby had to overcome in order to contest Ferrari's dominance of the racing world in the 1960s. Damon and Bale play a great duo in this movie which really makes the movie comical and dramatic throughout. Definitely recommend this movie!,10,3,4,1 December 2019
