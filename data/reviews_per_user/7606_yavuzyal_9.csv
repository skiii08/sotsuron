The King's Speech," Splendid!
","From it's content to directing, musics to acting, this movie is a masterpiece.
The directing techniques show themselfs from the very beginning of the movie, which makes it a strong beginning. They remind me of the techniques of 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'.
Musics were very good and well adjusted with the movie.
Actors and actresses made their jobs very well, but Colin Firth played one of the best performances in recent years with this movie.",9,2,2,28 July 2019
First Man," Way more than expected
","Besides the dramatic scenes with the Armstrong family (which were also great), the Space shuttle scenes were fascinating. Although I knew Apollo 11 has landed to the moon, the movie managed to give me tension at shuttle scenes with all the music and shaking actions. I also liked the small details about chemistry and physics in the movie, which is a credit to Damien Chazelle.",8,0,1,25 August 2019
The Exorcist," A classical masterpiece
","The Exorcist has so many classical scenes that are great for even today's movie industry.
It's soundtrack itself is a perfect one.
This is a must watch cult film in my humble opinion",8,1,1,28 July 2019
Grave of the Fireflies," A MUST WATCH MASTERPIECE!
","I don't remember myself crying this much after a movie for a long time. The moviemakers created the cutest child character and put her in war conditions, which makes you even more connected with Seita and Setsuko. And even though you know that Setsuko will die at the end, her death still makes you cry, which is also an accomplishment.",10,1,1,24 August 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Best Tarantino movie for me
","I think this movie has too many good parts. First off all, it has a developing story, which is great. It's soundtrack became a classical one. It's fight scenes are perfect, I really like Hattori Hanzo (I don't know why), and Uma Thurman acts very good in the movie. It became a cult in cinema history I think, and everybody must see it.",9,1,2,30 August 2019
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," GREAT!
","STORYLINE: Very well organized but more mixed than it should be.
ACTING: Very good acting.
JOKES: I laughed at some of em but I don't believe they are my type of jokes.
SOUNDTRACK: Very rich soundtrack with some good music in it. However, I believe they are overused during movie.
GENERAL: It was a great movie to spend time and have fun.",7,0,0,15 September 2019
Mary and Max," Importance of friendship
","First of all, I recommend this movie very much. I liked the style of the animation, an ugly world with ugly people around, which is very appropriate with the content. I liked the comedy part, it was just enough and appropriate. I loved the drama part, which made me cry and understand the importance of friendships. It was a great movie and I think everyone must see it!",8,0,0,30 August 2019
