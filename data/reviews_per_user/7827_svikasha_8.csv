Come and See," Haunting and harrowing, but also deeply moving.
","Come and See (1985) is one of those rare films that has the potential to shake one to their core. The film follows a young boy who digs up a rifle and is inadvertently thrust into World War II during the initial stages of Nazi Germany's invasion of Belarus. The film depicts many of Nazi Germany's horrific war crimes in the region including setting people on fire with gasoline and rounding up entire villages to be shot or burned. While the vast scale of Nazi Germany's atrocities are widely understood today, it is still deeply haunting to witness these atrocities on film. By the end of the film, the viewer will feel as they have aged considerably after witnessing such horrific deeds. Even the young boy ages on-screen. By the climax of the film, the young boy who was so hopeful and energetic at the beginning of the film is nearly unrecognizable and the viewers are left with a grim reminder of what happened when German soldiers invaded the Soviet Union during World War II.",10,4,5,6 January 2020
It," An Instant Classic Remake of a Classic Horror Series
","Based on the 1986 novel of the same name, the 2017 film 'It' tells the story of a group of pre-teens who are on a quest to overcome an ominous force that has been wreaking havoc and murdering the children of their home town for centuries dressed as a clown. The novel is a lot more gruesome than the film. A lot of the incest and abuse scenes were removed from the film to keep it more lighthearted and focused on the main antagonist which is an evil presence that simply goes by the name of Pennywise. The young cast deserves a lot of credit. Their remarkable performance will conjure up memories of more iconic films like 'E.T'., 'Stand by Me', and even the recent Netflix classic 'Stranger Things'. They certainly have a future in Hollywood. The film is noteworthy for Hollywood because its one of the few Horror films to come out of the industry that have generated more than $200 million at the box office within weeks of release. This alone should indicate the film's promise. It ended up being one of the most profitable films of 2017. Although, 'It' may not appeal to die-hard horror fans or even die-hard fans of the original series, the film does offer many genuinely horrifying moments. Children are commonly used to evoke horror within the horror genre. But 'It' managed to use the concept in a particularly new way with excellent results. 'It' offers a fresh relief from the usual Horror fare simply because the film has characters that are believable and fully developed. The fact that such a young cast was able to pull of a Stephen King novel is a testament to their talent. Like the novel, the film is bound to be an instant classic. Therefore, it's worth a watch.",9,3,10,11 September 2017
War Machine," Hollywood's Late but Necessary Reply to America's Prolonged Engagement in Afghanistan
","'War Machine' is a 2017 satirical war film that was released by Netflix in the spring of 2017. It is a fictionalized account loosely based on the story of General Stanley McChrystal. Although Hollywood has made many films depicting American forces in Iraq, very few films have been produced about the American war effort in Afghanistan. This fact is more astonishing when one considers that the War in Afghanistan is officially recognized as the longest military engagement in American history. Hollywood's silence in response to this prolonged and complex conflict is deafening. Fortunately, 'War Machine' serves as Hollywood's fitting but late reply to America's protracted and seemingly never ending conflict in Afghanistan.Although 'War Machine' does have an intriguing plot, even before the movie begins the film brings a lot of star power to the screen. Through the duration of the film, Topher Grace from 'That 70's Show', Brad Pitt, Ben Kingsley, and Russell Crowe all make an appearance on screen. Brad Pitt plays a four-star General named Glen McMahon who is appointed by an out of touch American president to take over and bring an end to the War in Afghanistan. At the opening of the film, the War in Afghanistan had been going on for over a decade. General McMahon takes charge of the situation and decides to aggressively pursue an ill-advised military campaign to retake the desolate Helmand province of the country. Although General McMahon is clearly committed to his men, his country, and his leadership role, he is poorly equipped to take on the daunting task of taming Afghanistan. General McMahon doesn't understand Afghanistan. Elections and democracy are foreign concepts to the Afghani people. The greatest scenes of the film depict the interactions between the bewildered General McMahon and President Hamid Karzai. Former Oscar Nominee Ben Kingsley brings his star power to the film in the role of the Afghani politician. Their humorous back and forth sheds some light on the true nature of the political reality of the government of Afghanistan. As the film continues, it becomes painfully obvious that Hamid Karzai is simply a figure head for a puppet state propped up by American military power. The actors truly do justice to the quagmire of the situation. As can be expected, despite the best of intentions, General McMahon fails to bring the Afghanistan conflict to a close. Like his predecessor, he is replaced by a new general. The cycle goes on. The grim nature of the content of the film is probably why the movie received such mixed reviews by audiences. A lot of the sharp wit that is an integral part of the whole tone of the film may go over people's heads. Others will simply find the material offensive. But the harsh criticism that this film received by critics and audiences is undeserved. This movie needed to be made. The War in Afghanistan has gone on for too long for it to be ignored. At the time 'War Machine' was released, America's War in Afghanistan had lasted for nearly two decades. This war has cost the United States and its allies billions of dollars and thousands of lives. But the most painful truth about this war is that there is very little to show for the tremendous sacrifice that has been given. The only option the world seems to have when confronted with such a high sunk cost seems to be to keep trying. Fire the current general and send in another general. Maybe the next one will get it right.",8,1,2,21 June 2017
"McFarland, USA"," An Instant Underdog Sports Classic Made in Disney's Provocative Style
","McFarland, USA is a city in California that to this day has a sizable Hispanic population, many of whom work as migrant farm workers picking crops. 'McFarland' is a film that tells the story of Coach White, a passionate coach who gets fired from his football coaching gig at a wealthy high school when he escalates a fight between him and his players to violence. The wealthy high school football players seemed more concerned about the after party than the game. Athletics for these players is a prestige thing that has nothing to do with sportsmanship. After a series of disrespectful actions, Coach White snaps and subsequently gets fired. But as Coach White reflects later to another coach when he arrives at his new school, 'It's not the fight in the dog coach, it's the dog in the fight...depends on the size of the dog...'.Coach White moves to Cliff Avenue in a Hispanic neighborhood with his wife and two daughters. When he first arrives in the new neighborhood, one of his daughters questions if the family had ended up in Mexico. The Whites struggle at first to fit into their new neighborhood. Meanwhile, the high school students in the small Hispanic town of McFarland have their own struggle. Most of the students at MacFarland have jobs. Athletics isn't even an option for many of them because they come from the fields to go to school and run back to the fields when class gets outs. Many become adults in those very fields. Unless a prison gets to them first. It is a hard life which stands in stark contrast to the lives of Coach White's previous students. He begins to see the athletic potential in his hardworking students and questions the temporary nature of his transitory job as coach at MacFarland. In the classic Disney fashion, Coach White's new community welcomes him. His neighbor even plants him a tree and tells him, 'in five years senor you're going to have some nice shade'. The simple transitions in the film show the migrant worker's lives with Hispanic music in the background. The scenes are poetic. But the most beautiful part of the film is the raw determination of the high school students trying to compete in a sport and environment that sets them up for failure. A boy named Thomas Valles becomes a de facto leader of the team after Coach White catches the high school student running at 12 miles an hour. This same boy shows up to practice with bruises because he gets his dad to punch him instead of a wall since as a migrant worker his father needs his hands to work. It isn't until coach White works a whole day as a migrant worker himself, picking crops getting paid by the field instead of by the hour that he begins to understand the plight of his athletes. In the spirit of Stand and Deliver Coach White understands that he needs to go beyond his position as coach for these students. He begins to treat them like his own. During one scene, he rushes to a park without enough money for the entrance fee and tells the officer, 'I've got five dollars and seven kids who have never seen the ocean'. He brings his students to the beach. Eventually, McFarland becomes more than a temporary home for Coach White and his family. It becomes their community, one which adopts them as warmly as they adopted it. The family moments such as the father's speech at his daughters quincea√±era will tug at your heartstrings. Coach White disproves Thomas Valles' initial belief that, 'Nobody stays in McFarland unless they have to. Because there is nothing American dream about this place'. This film is based off a true story and Coach White ended up at McFarland coaching at the town's high school long after better prospects opened up for him. By the end, Coach White recognizes that these kids at McFarland cherish cross country and athletics, something he admits is a privilege many take for granted.",8,3,3,21 July 2017
Enemy at the Gates," A War Film at its Core that Attempts to be a Thriller and Love Story
","The Cold War was an awkward time for the English-speaking film industry. Despite the industry's penchant for depicting World War Two, depicting Russians as the heroes in this epic conflict has always been a 'no-no' given the political climate of the Cold War. When one considers the means through which the Soviet Union achieved its narrow but decisive victory over Nazi Germany, it feels more than a little distasteful to glorify the faction's role in the struggle. But it is historically dishonest to deny it as well. Enemy at the Gates is a good attempt by western filmmakers at capturing the story of the Battle of Stalingrad from the perspective of Vasily Zaitsev played by Jude Law. This character is loosely based on a famous legendary Soviet sniper with the same name.In the opening scene of the film, a rough Cossack father guides his son, a much younger Zaitsev, as he attempts to hunt a wolf in the cold Russian winter. Shortly thereafter, a much older Zaitsev is seen being transported by train to Stalingrad where he participates in a disastrous Soviet assault on a German position as patriotic music plays in the background. Zaitsev is eventually used as a propaganda figure by a political officer who discovers his talent for marksmanship. Zaitsev becomes a symbol of the epic Soviet struggle against the Nazi regime. The stark contrast between the beautiful background music and the carnage depicted on screen has certainly been used before. It is clich√©, but it succeeds in adding some dramatic effect. Unfortunately, it is the only time when such embellishments succeed to that end in the film.Enemy at the Gates is a flawed film at its core. But the biggest flaw in the film lies in the historical inaccuracy. It's a shame too, because otherwise it could have been both a satisfying and thought- provoking war flick. The production value is certainly there. A deep investment was definitely made to capture the raw carnage of battle. But the historic embellishments in the film take away from the powerful effect of the true story. Why add so much Hollywood style flair when the true history of Stalingrad is gritty enough by itself. The embellishments were unnecessary and instead of augmenting the emotional effect of the film, butcher it.Any member of the audience with a keen understanding of the true history will find some of the historical inaccuracies in the film to be cringe-worthy. While everybody knows the Soviet Union won the Battle of Stalingrad, Enemy at the Gates portrays Soviet leadership as so blatantly incompetent, that after watching the film, one can't help but wonder, how? Perhaps this is why most western audiences still think World War Two was won in Western Europe. This is simply untrue. Soviet leadership was far more competent and German leadership was far more incompetent than they are portrayed in Enemy at the Gates. That doesn't do justice to the history.Enemy at the Gates tries to raise broader questions about topics such as loyalty, the role of class in Communism, and the pain of having to remember the faces of individual soldiers as a sniper. But the film only briefly touches on these larger topics. There is barely any depth. Perhaps the greatest scenes in the film are the tense battle of wits between Zaitsev and his German rival, a talented major who teaches at Nazi Germany's sniper school. Amidst all of this, the film attempts to weave a romantic narrative into the carnage that simply feels out of place. The female lead character, Tania Chernova, played by Rachel Weisz is interesting enough by herself. But barring one intensely erotic scene where Chernova and Zaitsev get intimate in a crowded barracks, her character's role in the entire film seems questionable at best and altogether out of place at worst. So perhaps Enemy at the Gates tries to do too many things at once. But it's still an enjoyable film. It's just not a profound or historical one.",7,0,1,19 May 2017
Downfall," The Downfall Offers a Rare Chance to Witness the Collapse of the Nazi Regime
","Hollywood loves to depict World War Two. The Second World War has overwhelmingly been the setting of choice for major filmographic depicts of war. But the German film industry, for understandable reasons, has been much more hesitant to produce such films. To be fair, how does a filmmaker depict such a period in human history? How does one do justice to its tragic nature without glorifying the carnage? It isn't easy to depict Adolph Hitler on screen accurately without risking alienating and horrifying a great number of people. Such a task is especially not worth attempting on a budget of only ¬Ä13.5 million. This fact alone makes the 2004 German film 'Der Untergang' an accomplishment worthy of acknowledgement. The war drama is called 'The Downfall' in English and basically depicts the final ten days of Adolf Hitler's Nazi Regime in 1945. The film was directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel and received critical acclaim upon its release. But it is a movie that can still be watched years later. The story is influenced by two books: 'Until the Final Hour' by Traudl Junge and 'Inside Hitler's Bunker' by Joachim Fest. Traudle Junge was a historical figure who worked as Adolf Hitler's last private secretary until his death. The film is partly based on her personal account of the events that took place before Hitler's suicide.Traudle was young when she was hired by Hitler to be his secretary in 1942. At the opening of the film, a much older Traudle expresses remorse for admiring Hitler in her youth. A common theme among portrayals of World War Two is that bad things happen to good people. In The Downfall, bad things happen to bad people. The Downfall was a dark and grim movie to watch. The movie is often both absurd and horrifying at the same time. There are times when the movie portrays the solitude and hopelessness of the characters in the film so well that you forget that the characters being portrayed in the film are some of the most ruthless leaders of the 20th century. There is a scene where SS officers and soldiers are getting drunk and partying with topless prostitutes in a bombed out Berlin that is actively being taken over by the invading Soviet army. Everybody knows that they are going to die. Yet nobody, at any point of the movie, can come to terms with the insanity of their situation.Both the First and Second World Wars can both be summed up as soldiers fighting for politicians who were completely unwilling to fight for them. However, understanding this is one thing. But getting a chance to visually witness the stark contrast between the fates of the soldiers on the losing side to the fates of the politicians on the losing side is quite awakening. There is a scene where Eva Braun, Hitler's future wife dances on a table to celebrate Hitler's birthday even as the venue is getting shelled by artillery fire. Children are dying in Berlin to try to protect them from the invaders. But it isn't until a shell explodes right next to the gathering, shattering the windows of the venue in the process, that the vain attempts at celebrations are brought to a halt. These 'leaders' couldn't care less about the Germany people. Half of them even abandon Hitler and his regime before the war is over. There is a sense of desperation throughout the whole film. But that isn't the most horrific part. Any film that can get an audience member to feel pity for a barbarian like Adolph Hitler is remarkable enough to be worth watching at least once. At his ruined birthday party, against his own commander's advice, Hitler declares, 'I will defeat them in Berlin, or face my downfall'. He failed, and the rest is history.",9,1,2,23 June 2017
Flight," We need more complex characters like Denzel Washington's Captain Whitaker from Hollywood
","Flight is an enjoyable film about an esteemed airline pilot struggling to overcome the alcoholism and substance abuse problems that have disrupted his personal and professional life. Although Hollywood has produced a number of films depicting substance abuse and addiction, very few have chosen to portray addicts in the manner that Flight does. Both mental illness and substance abuse are widely recognized as epidemic in America. Despite being so widespread, both are widely misunderstood. Even among health care professionals. This is precisely why Hollywood needs to make more films with complex characters like Pilot William 'Whip' Whitaker in Flight.Captain Whitaker, played by Denzel Washington, brings back the magic of other 'loose cannon' authority figure roles from Washington's distinguished career. At this point in Washington's career, nobody can deny the man's acting credentials. However, Washington's role in Flight resembles some of Washington's other iconic roles such as Officer Alonzo Harris in Training Day and Frank Lucas from American Gangster. This alone makes the film worthwhile to watch. However, like many films, Flight sacrifices realism for entertainment. But this sacrifice pays off as the film develops into an emotionally- involving tale of redemption. At the beginning of the film, Washington's character pilots a commercial passenger jet upside down for an evasive maneuver after turbulence causes the plane's tail to malfunction. Apparently, this is actually possible. The famed Boeing test pilot Alvin M. Johnston once performed a similar barrel roll in a Boeing 367, the predecessor of the modern Boeing 737. But it is probably unlikely that a pilot could fly such a large plane, upside down, for as long as the film made it seem. Then again, Hollywood's job isn't to teach physics. While Captain Whittaker embarks on the doomed flight that could potentially end his career, nearby a pretty heroin addict named Nicole Maggen played by English actress Kelly Reilly is on the verge of being evicted by her creepy landlord. After getting him to leave, she overdoses and is taken to the nearby hospital that just so happens to be the same hospital that Captain Whitaker is destined to end up in. The two characters eventually meet and share a cigarette in the hallways of the hospital in a touchingly profound scene where they are interrupted by a cancer patient who seems oddly complacent in his own mortality. There is no denying the on-screen chemistry between the broken pilot and the cute redhead from Bankhead. The two deeply flawed characters eventually form a relationship which helps each confront their own flaws. At one point, Captain Whittaker asks Maggen, 'And you say you're a masseuse. What kind of a masseuse? '. To her own amusement, she responds, 'I've been every kind of masseuse there is'.The biggest thing that Flight does right is its depiction of depression and substance abuse. Neither depression nor substance abuses are always readily visible. Sometimes, extraordinarily talented individuals, such as surgeons, judges, and even airline pilots can struggle with substance abuse and still carry on in their professional lives. This portrayal of substance abuse is a refreshing and brilliant stroke of realism in a film industry that too often portrays addicts as self-destructive stereotypes with clearly visible moral failings. Flight reminds the audience of many important aspects of overcoming an addiction. It is usually not so easy and often takes multiple tries. Quitting cold turkey is impossible until one recognizes that they have a problem. Stressful events, like being told you might be held culpable for the deaths of six people in an airplane crash, can trigger a relapse. Sometimes one has to hit rock bottom, before one recognizes the extent of a problem. Unfortunately for Captain Whitaker, rock bottom is snorting cocaine to get sober from a night of heavy drinking right before a hearing before a federal agency.The film's ending felt a little sudden and abrupt. Even the male lead tells the audience as much. 'That was it. I was finished. I was done. It was as if I had reached my lifelong limit of lies. I could not tell one more lie. And maybe I'm a sucker. 'Cause if I had told just one more lie, I could have walked away from all that mess. Kept my wings, kept my false sense of pride...My chances of ever flying again are slim to none. And I accept that. I wrote letters to each of the families that had lost loved ones. Some of them were able to hear my apology. Some of them never will...But at least I am sober. And I thank god for that. I'm grateful for that. And this is going to sound real stupid coming from a guy who is locked up in prison but, for the first time in my life, I am free'. The final line of the film is equally thought-provoking. As the lead's estranged son visits his father in prison to interview him for a college application, he coyly asks Whitaker, 'Who are you?'. Surprised by how difficult it is answer such a simple question, Washington's character responds, 'That's a good question'; a good question indeed.",8,1,2,19 May 2017
Sully," Watch this Film for the Cinematography and Tom Hanks if Nothing Else
","Although politically charged and sometimes overly dramatic, Sully tells the incredible story of the pilot who landed a plane on the Hudson River. More specifically, the film deals with the aftermath consequences of the pilot's decision.In early 2009, the now infamous Capt. Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger, played by the equally famous Tom Hanks in the film 'Sully', attempted to make an emergency landing on January 15. Although he tried to reach an airport, he ends up landing a full plane on the Hudson River and becomes a national hero overnight. Watching these events take place on-screen is breathtaking. However, the aftermath of the events prove to be much less amusing. Sully is eventually investigated and questioned for his decision to land the plane on the Hudson. Although 'Sully' is a short film to begin with, the drawn out investigation made the film appear to be much longer than about an hour and a half. The directing and cinematography is very tastefully done. Which shouldn't be surprising considering the film was directed by Clint Eastwood. But the story leaves the audience wanting. Ultimately, Sully is exonerated in the film thanks to simulations that prove the wisdom of the famed pilot's split-second decision making. But the investigation is portrayed as unnecessary and mildly intrusive. Many people took offense to the way the National Transportation Safety Board was portrayed in the film. This caused a little controversy among those who work for the investigative agencies responsible for protecting the public. The thing every good movie needs is a villain. Unfortunately, in 'Sully', the villain happens to be working for the public. Unlike Canadian geese.",8,0,0,24 June 2017
