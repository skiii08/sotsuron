Marie Antoinette," An affecting portrait of an 18th century Paris Hilton
","We all know the story: Marie Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI. Social brat, rich, politically unaware, spoiled little girl. I'd thought this movie would offer some new revelations into Antoinette's life, but, for the most part, it didn't. Which is to compliment the movie. What the movie does succeed in doing is pulling sympathy out of the viewer. We come to know Antoinette as pure and rather innocent, guilted by the very people in government for not being aware of France's misery that had sheltered her away from it in the first place.The very last shot of the movie epitomized this tragedy, and also the tragedy of the end of monarchic France. (Those who have seen the film won't be able to forget this shot.) It is a still shot of the chandelier of Antoinette's bedroom, on the floor, shattered. I don't have time or room here to explain all of the things this shattered chandelier means. But it sums up a lot: France's ruined glory, Antoinette's ruined innocence, the end of the king and queen, the end of their parties and misters and mistresses, the end of it all. It is a heart-wrenching, Ishiguro-esquire ending. And it makes the movie, despite the film's errors of cinematography and context development, very worth-seeing.",10,2,4,28 October 2006
Cloverfield," A destruction movie with the purest intentions
","There's been a lot of talk going around that Cloverfield is a creature feature that tries, and fails, to put a humanistic face on the experience of destruction. But Cloverfield, which is filmed entirely with a hand-held camera operated by several of the main actors, does not need to be a humanistic; it's just human. With its characters' almost total lack of information, its sensory limitations, and its shortness, Cloverfield presents a truly real view of destruction. We cannot see everything, can see almost nothing, and that is where the horrific truth lies. Its success lies in its ability to capture how weak humans are in the face of terror, how insignificant and cursory our sufferings.No, the acting isn't terrific; no, the writing isn't even close to original; no, not all the plot points click together just so. But what is clear here, and what lasts and lingers and is remembered, is the producer's and director's deep affection for monstrosity, for fear, for buildings falling down and people being sucked up into abysmal misery. Cloverfield is all at once visceral and clever, shamelessly entertaining and uncompromisingly scary, emotionally sadistic and wisely comic. Maybe everyone, in the end, does die; but no recent movie has offered as much proof that blood is still pumping through American cinema's veins.",8,1,5,19 January 2008
Crash," A Menagerie of Raw Human Emotion
","In the first scene of this film, Don Cheadle says, among other profound things, 'I think we just crash into each other, just to feel something.' This short quote, in actuality, sums up the entire point that the filmmakers were trying present. In the sleepy city of Los Angeles, the viewers are taken on a wild ride - perhaps a corny simile, noting the title - in the lives of numerous, nameless souls, all lost and confused. We see the lives of racial minorities living in the back alley slums of the city, and in the next scene, the lives of rich bigot whites. By the end of the film, we realize that whether black or white or rich or poor, we are all looking for answers, and that, although we do not realize it, those answers lie in the most unlikely people around us. A menagerie of raw human emotion - fear, anger, sadness, joy, and above all, dysphoria. Although it seems like quite a list to take on in one film, perhaps too long, Crash tackles them all with both open-mindedness and subtle restraint, in only 113 minutes. It took Magnolia three hours, and believe me, Crash leaves Magnolia in the dust. This wild ride of a film - by the end of it, the viewer will have crashed into the truth of their own lives, going home to their beds, popcorn stuck in their back molars, stunned - and emotionally drained.",10,1,7,10 May 2005
The Village," A Gallery of Brilliant Performances
","Let me preface this by saying I thought this movie was very underrated. It's not that people didn't get it--they were simply expecting something else. And I would caution you to confuse disappointment with surprise.I personally thought that Bryce Dallas Howard's performance was so brilliant that I was disappointed she was not nominated for it at the Oscars. Her pouring of her emotions--the natural flow and grace of her character. She is a breath of fresh air among what many modern critics consider great acting. No, she wasn't a lost soul caught in the center of a mid-life disaster--she did not love the bottle and she did not love strange men. She was only a girl with a blindness that, rather than incapacitating her, made her stronger. She was bright, charming, and insightful...and alas, you forget it is only an act.I also thought John Hurt's performance was remarkable, as was Adrien Brody's. Although Brody's role as a mentally retarded young man was subtle and seemingly unimportant to the storyline, his presence is felt throughout the whole movie.Tremendous movie, chilling performances. And perhaps if we did not all see this as a horror film, it would not prove to be such a disappointment.",9,0,1,30 May 2005
Jarhead," Sexual Deprivation, and other elements of war...
","My favorite movie of all time is American Beauty, so I expected a lot from this movie, directed, of course, by Sam Mendes. Its sharp opening and initial surreally bright cinematography is reminiscent of Mendes, but throughout the movie I made the mistake of comparing this to Mendes's early work--when it in fact is nothing like American Beauty or Road to Perdition. And I think that is the mistake a lot of critics make in reviewing this movie--you must not look at Jarhead as another Mendes, you must look at it as a 'war' movie superior to its contemporaries. Another mistake Jarhead reviewers make is looking at this movie as all action, snappy character development, just like other movies of its genre. This is the story of a man descending into anger and depression ignited by war. There are a lot of symbolic elements, a lot of themes that most people will not see when viewing. There is also the theme of political blindness, and sexual deprivation, maybe even suppressed homosexuality? In any case, Jarhead is a movie to see, and not one to just watch for entertainment. Is 'Mendesian' in its literary qualities--irony, metaphor, symbolism, but at the same time, a thrilling and tragically hysterical movie experience.",9,2,4,6 November 2005
Mulholland Drive," Fascinating and Fantastic
","When you watch Mulholland Dr., you will not immediately understand everything (you might not understand anything). But an intelligent viewer will gather that, though they might not get everything right away, there is at least something to get. There is a structure to Mulholland Dr., there is a rhyme to its reason. What's important to remember is that it is about dreams. And not only those we experience in our sleep. Dreams that are projections of what our futures might have been like, dreams of going back and changing things, dreams of becoming something important and necessary to the world. But as Peter Travers stated in his Rolling Stone review, just 'let it take you in.' I am confident that if you do let it take you in, with all its colors and beautiful score pieces, etc., you will take from this movie perhaps not a gist of the real plot, but instead what is truly important--the actual feel of a film that is destined to become a classic.",10,1,3,18 February 2006
