The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Really bad
","I enjoyed the first two parts and was completely surprise by this one. The script is bad, the rhythm of the story is very slow and I didn't understand some of the things that happen there. Why is she not in love with her boyfriend anymore and suddenly she loves Peeta? It doesn't make sense. Also, her performance is really bad and the other actors are not doing better either. Almost nothing is credible anymore. And since the script does not have a clear continuance, I almost forgot what happened in the first two parts. Really bad, I watched it hoping till the end that at some point it will get back to its 'original' rhythm and to a better performance of the actors.",1,26,38,22 February 2015
