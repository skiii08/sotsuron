Ghost," Excellent
","Patrix Swayze is one of my favourite actors. The first time I saw him on screen, he was in Point Break, and was great. When I rented this out and found out he was a character in Point Break, I was much more hopeful. And am glad. This, no matter what anyone says, really is a great great film.Sam and Molly are a seemingly happy couple living in an apartment in an American city. Sam is in the financial business and Molly is seemingly a house-wife. His supposed best friend Karl and him are partners, only when he is betrayed and killed. His never-ending love for Molly allows him to stay on Earth, but only as a ghost, hence the title. After an emotional scene in which he sees his dead body, he is determined to make contact with Molly and warn her of the trouble she is in. He finds help in a phony 'pshycic' who actually has powers, and she, reluctantly (after a hilarious encounter) decides to help him. At first, Molly doesn't believe the seemingly impossible equation. But as more and more things fit, she begins to believe. Could it be possible? No matter how many bad things you hear about this film (hopefully you won't hear many) do not listen. I'm not a huge fan of romantic comedies but this, as well as making you laugh endlessly, keeps you on the edge of your seat as well as entertaining. Emmaculatly well done, this is a never-ending classic that has found a safe, comfortable place in my film collection. Overall: ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)",10,5,7,8 January 2005
Casablanca," 'Here's lookin at you, kid'
","Look at the above summary, then question: 'What the heck kinda line is that?' Well, despite the fact that that is exactly what I thought, no-one can deny that 'Casablanca' is a timeless classic, and a deserved one, too. Anybody who appreciates films should see this immediately, considering how epic in scope it is, and how likable it still remains to be. Yes, Casablanca really is marvellous.But why? Well, the plot goes like this: Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) runs a saloon, and a popular one, too. He's accompanied by Sam, his singer on the piano (one of the films main great features: the musical score) right at the start of the second world war. One day, his ex-lover walks in the door, accompanied with her husband. Rick sinks into oblivion, alcohol his only friend.A curiously simple set up, but a marvellous romance- you really can feel the passion and chemistry between the two stars, as events unfold and destiny takes its course.Funny and epic, the best of all time.**** out of ****",10,2,3,4 June 2005
Minority Report," Excellent futuristic thriller
","Steven Spielberg is a genius. So many great films he has directed. The Man who created 'Jaws' 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Schindlers List' is back for more. In one of his best pictures yet. It's 2054. A new method of crime prevention 'pre-crime' allows the police to look into the future and see the horrific results of murder and rape as they unfold. After a quick introduction to this process, were straight into the big and bold; main man John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is accused of a future murder- to a man he's never heard of. So he's on the run, from a harsh detective (superbly played by Colin Farrell) as he uncovers some horrible truths and has to go back to the unwelcoming past. Minority report is very good, but also very disturbing- the fact that this film was a PG-13 or a '12' in England is shocking. Parents, a note: if your child is under 12 at least I would strongly recommend you watch this film first. It's dark, compelling, and disturbing- particularly in a scene where he has to exchange his eyes for protection... This is a fantastic film however that should be viewed and loved by everyone bold enough to come in its path. Never fail to believe: Spielberg has come up with yet another masterpiece.

The Big Lebowski," Bizarre...?
","The Big Lebowski. One of the more bizarre movies I've seen by a long shot, this follows swearaholic Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski who is mistaken and has his rug 'soiled' near the start of the film. Going to the intended 'soiled-rug' person, The Dude gets himself foolishly involved in a kidnapping case in which a womans toe is cut off. Him and his buddy Walter and idiotic friend Donny (Shut the F**K up!!) Try to figure it all out. This film mainly succeeds because of the characters; John Tuturro as a ludicrous child molester, Donny and Walter, the film's high point, always finding new hilarious dialogue to spit at the camera. Had it not been for some fantastic performances from Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, this may well not be the funny thriller/slacker comedy that it was. A memorable movie, filled to the brim with politically incorrect scenes and some unusually twisted phrases and comedy, The Big Lebowski scores big. But what do you expect if it's done by the Coen Brothers?Overall: **** out of ***** (4 out of 5)",8,0,2,7 January 2005
Citizen Kane," A cinematic landmark, and an achievement in any aspect of life
","Citizen Kane (according to the American Film Institute) is the greatest film ever made. Though I cannot comment fairly on that (I haven't even seen half of the nominated 100) I can assure any readers one thing: Citizen Kane is marvellous. I am not simply following the crowd, as I thought one to many official movie reviewers were doing. I agree with them; Citizen Kane lives up to the hype, just about.I heard from a few average (but movie-loving) people that they thought Citizen Kane was good, but not superb or as good as it was supposed to be. I read so many great reviews, and really did think the reviewers were simply afraid to put this historic film out of place. I apologise: Citizen Kane is nearly perfect, and were it not for some small details in the second half of the film, it would be.Nearly everything is spot on. The musical score, in particular, is the best I've ever seen. The film has charisma, charm. The acting is impeccable. The script fantastic. It's epic. And all done by a 25-year-old, which really gives it full marks.And especially for the time, it must have been incredible. The cinematography, the landmark qualities, everything was so original and new. But in the final half hour, deeper insight is necessary. We are left hanging on a thread, wondering especially after some incidents how the newsroom is going. We know little of Kane newspapers, though the dilemmas in his personal life are particularly well played out.Top banana, this is.**** out of **** (4 out of 4)",10,12,18,3 June 2005
Memento," Funny, bold and intricate
","As is the case with me, first viewings can be deceptive. The first time I have watched many different films people have raved about, I have been left feeling disappointed (as was the case with 'Memento'). I have expected so much more, and on the second viewing, I know what to expect, so it seems to make it better. But, for better, nothing is what it seems with 'Memento'. This is both disturbing, hilarious, violent and thoughtful.Leanord (aka Sammy Jenkins- in my view, anyway) is a psychological wreck. He writes notes and gives himself tattoos to keep memories and 'play detective' for the ultimate reason: to avenge the rape and murder of his wife.Surprisingly, it sounds a lot worse than it is. This may have a dark subject matter, and bear some of the worse language ever put on film, but this is both original and funny. Done end to beginning, Memento is brilliant.**** out of ****",9,0,2,21 June 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Really funny...British comedy is at its glorious best...
","I am not a huge fan of the British comedies, even though that is my nationality. I don't mind them, but I feel there is more fun to be had watching an American film such as 'South Park' or 'The Naked Gun'. And then, along came Shaun of the Dead. My views were completely shifted. First thing I've just got to say is what a film: you've simply GOT to see this and if you haven't already MAKE sure you rent it or even buy in the near future. It's tense, fun and so, so funny. One of the great things about the film is, although you may have seen these actors on T.V. elsewhere (i.e. The Office or Spaced) it's there first proper time acting on a set and they do so, so well, impeccably timing as if they'd being doing this for 25 years. Another great aspect is how they blend the different genres together: there's horror in the pub sounded out by bellowing laughs, there's romance beforehand topped off with utter stupidity. So really, this film is just one genre; it effortlessly manages to be about three or four. And it's done so damn well (the Garden scene is so outrageously funny!) Really, this is essential viewing and if you want to see arguably the funniest British comedy ever (that can be watched over and over again) then go anywhere you can to purchase this immediately.Overall: ****/ out of ***** (4 and a half out of 5)",9,0,1,9 January 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Disney's Best Movie!
","Have you read the summary? I really, never thought I'd say that. By I have. How could any Disney film get better than an all time classic, the Lion King? Five names: Gore Verbinski, Johnny Depp, Kiera Knightly, Orlando Bloom and Geoffry Rush. They have, marvellously, created the best Disney movie of all time, and by far the best movie of 2003. Yes. Even better than Lost in Translation.This film is splendid because of so many reasons: for one, the acting is top-notch and so believable. Two: they blend in many different aspects immaculately. It's funny, suspense, fast-paced and overall, simply brilliant. Disney's Best and most well done movie is not 'Snow White' or 'Alice in Wonderland'. In fact, not even 'Steam-Boat Willie'. It's there most recent effort to date: Pirates of the Caribbean.Final Analysis: ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)",9,1,5,8 January 2005
Troy," A disappointing 'epic'
","Completely overshadowed by 'Braveheart' and 'The Return of the King' in the 'genre' the fight for right, Troy doesn't make up for the key elements that it lacks. Great battle scenes and visuals just don't overcome wooden acting and sloppy storyline. Paris (Orlando Bloom) simply won't get away with stealing Helen of Troy. He's had one too many 'nights' with the lady and the idea of stealing her away is completely preposterous, especially since she is married to the king of Sparta. Was it not based on a true story I'd be laughing in sheer disbelief at the lack of common sense in Bloom's character.Anyhow, since it did happen, you can guess what's to follow in such barbaric times. The king immediately wages war, picking up Achilles (Brad Pitt) along the way. If you want to win the greatest war, you need the greatest warrior...So a suitable premise, and for the most point, Troy delivers. It's the fact that it tries to be deep. There is completely where it fails. Did it stay with what it probably should have been (a passable popcorn flick) it would have been entertaining. But it delves far to deep into sentimentality and utter stupidity that its unbearably shallow characters cannot handle.Visually superb, Troy passes the eye test. But with wooden acting, weak characters and utterly unbalanced screenplay, Troy is enjoyable but just as silly.Evaluation: 5 out of 10",5,2,6,13 April 2005
The Terminator," A brutal, yet flawed classic
","In 1984, little known director James Cameron picked up little known body building muscle man Arnold Schwarzenegger for a sci fi action movie 'The Terminator'. In short, both do very good jobs: Cameron, with his excellent provision of special effects and action sequences, and Arnold, expertly playing the terminator: an emotionless killing machine.For the time, and even now, this film is nearly startlingly brutal. Less slow than 'Alien' and more in your face, this is a no-holds, dark piece of work, as this piece of human metal performs hideous operations and cold bloodily (yes, the Terminator has blood) kills innocent (or not so innocent) beings.This film was a landmark for it's time, a lot to do with the special effects. Maybe less so impressive today, but the action sequences are frequent, and frequently impressive. This is tense, exciting stuff, from the word go. We care for our characters, but in a strange way, this Terminator has likable qualities: it manages to be so insensitive, yet so undeniably unstoppably cool.Where this film faults is general errors. They may be little, and not hold back the entertainment value, but do stick out like a knife in the back. (Note: James Cameron directed 'The Titanic', check this website for goofs!) For instance, the tension is unintentionally held back in one scene where our heroin desperately shoves a quarter into a phone box and dials 911. Since when is money needed for emergency calls?Still, this is brutal and effective: a classic, and still today, it remains and very solid, if faulted, movie.***/ out of **** (3 and a half out of 4)",9,0,2,20 May 2005
We Were Soldiers," Entertaining, but way, way to biased
","Gosh. America loves their country. They love the fact that they win wars, and kill others. But they're Americans, so it's justified, right? Wrong. This is the latest piece of dross that is leaving me wincing with every horrifically biased element of every U.S. war film.On the blurb, it says that it is a war classic, that truly shows the brutality of the Vietnam war. About all the horror. And plenty of violence. In one scene, a bomb literally blows up in a mans brain. Whilst that aspect may be relatively horrific, it doesn't do what other great war epics have: truly show the madness. When the guy is blown up, it's an American helping him, right? The fact is, in Platoon and Apocalypse now, it really showed how dreadful the war was. In this, the American flag is always waving in the breeze, with Mel heroically blowing the 'bad guys' to bits. The only thing that is good about this is that the violence is realistic, and that it is very entertaining. But that cannot be shoved aside. This a bias, lewd piece of garbage, that may be good for instantly forgettable entertainment, but certainly isn't 'Saving Private Ryan'. Now that one really stays in my memory.",4,0,5,27 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The best of the bunch
","Who could have possibly predicted a film (especially a sequel) than the original 'Star Wars'. You couldn't! But it came, in 'The Empire strikes back' a sci-fi masterpiece that achieved the impossible and marked it's name as cinema gold. The third, no matter how good, could not get better than that- or could it?...Well, in my opinion, yes. The third instalment in the trilogy goes to new heights of excellence and breeds incredible sci-fi effects and action. This really is a great film. With a dose of humour, the third and final film in the original star wars trilogy is the best. An excellent film.***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)",10,0,0,5 February 2005
Alien," A terrifying, involving and memorable masterpiece
","Alien is classic for a few reasons. For one: it is a rare beast, so emotionally and incredibly involving that when you stop watching it you have to emerge from the world you were in. Two: it defined the genre, a gory space horror that remains shocking today. And three: it is one of the greatest films of all time.We know little about the Nostromo when it first appears in that isolated place called space: only that it has 7 passengers and is heading towards earth. We are soon introduced to the characters, already on a mission as they receive a distress call from an unknown planet. A few are reluctant to go, but they are forced to (mainly because of the incredibly dominating Ash) unaware of the horror that awaits them...I guess human instinct and interest must have got the best of them, because instead of instantly fleeing and at the sight of a beast that was once alive (that stands an enormous hight) they enter it. Then do they flee? No. They go deeper. And deeper.Squeamish people may very well want to keep what I say in mind. There is some shocking, jumpy stuff here, making even the hardest jump and genuinely fear for the lives of these fictional characters, despite their evident stupidity. A pillow may be handy nearby.Though we don't know why at the time, Ash develops a huge interest in these aliens, and seems completely intent on keeping them alive, unaware of the immense danger it will lead these passengers to live through. Despite having a face-hugger strapped across his face Kane (John Hurt) is let through without being bacteria-free checked, endangering the others more than himself. The chest burster scene will prove my point.The thing is, though this may not seem incredible, there just isn't a lot wrong with it. The script, acting and storyline are brilliant, and the tension is unbelievable and, nearing the end, unbearable. The constant feeling of fear twists in the pit of your stomach, and though the outcome may be slightly evident, you can't help feeling genuine fear and sorrow for these people and hope for their survival.Along with that, it ask interesting political questions, aimed at government agencies and other undercover special forces. I wish not to reveal these (mainly for public enjoyment) but keep an ear close and handy and you will see what I mean. It is both daring and intelligent.Sigourny Weaver (playing Ripley) is incredible, her performance completely real and believable. This film is not isolated like the characters stuck in it: this is a bold, in your face film that demands seeing. A masterpiece of modern (and old) cinema.**** out of **** (4 out of 4)",10,1,4,19 May 2005
Forrest Gump," Heartwarming? As if
","This is a truly patriotic movie, and guess what: not even half of America probably likes it. It's got a dunce as the protagonist, who, for sentimentality reasons talks slowly, he's got your typical, advice-giving all-American mother, references to the Vietnam war and America's greatness and, of course, an all to frequently appearing love story.Yep, that's Forrest Gump.Coincidentilly appearing in many historical times, never funny (maybe save the 'Watergate' incident) these soon tire. It's simply done too many times, and each occurrence is as crap as the last. Many people have stated this an 'entertaing, heartwarming tale'. Are you watching the same film, with references to paedophilia, incest, war violence, death, cancer and drug addiction, all through the eyes of a disabled person. Heartwarming? Well, no. This film may have been entertaining were it not so sad. It's got many occasions where you could watch happily. But everything bad in the film you've seen at the times it could be entertaining stick with you. The incest, the paedophilia, the drug use, the attempted suicide. It sticks with you.Bad things happen to often in this film, and it's justified by Gump's idiotic nature.I'll give it a ** out of **** for few moments of entertainment and savour.",5,1,2,31 May 2005
Pitch Black," Decent action/horror.
","When I heard Vin Diesel was in this, I decided to give it a try. He's really a great actor and no mistake. He was the the whole movie in 'XXX', truly a magnetic force. He put a pretty good performance in for his screen time in Saving Private Ryan, and was also in the hottest movie of 2001, The Fast and The Furious. His only bad (REALLY BAD?!) performance, and movie, for that, was A Man Apart. But this couldn't be that bad...could it? Defiently not. This is not a great film, but it's a pretty decent action/horror (definitely better than A Man Apart, anyway). It's reasonably exciting as well, and it's only dragged down slightly by the occasional corny script. The fact is, although this may disappoint some horror fans, it definitely serves as a welcome antidote to a stressful day. Silly, dumb fun, Pitch Black is a above average thriller that will probably please most Diesel Fans.Final Analysis: *** out of ***** (3 out of 5)",7,1,3,5 January 2005
"I, Robot"," Fantastic... one of the best sci-fi's ever
","I Robot is great.Free from pretentious Sci-Fi nonsense, this is a fresh, original idea with superb special effects, action and story- without those even being the best aspects. Welcome Will Smith: tough, muscular cop who is willing (in a clichéd fashion) to go against the system.It may be clichéd, but in such a way that it's a treat.He is on a murder case and he is determined to reveal that a (gasp!) robot (named Sunny) is guilty. But no-one will believe him. Because Robots have no brains, and are not programmed to commit crimes. But little did they know that a special breed was being reconstructed in frequent quantities...If you ever read any negativity towards this film, blank it out of your mind. It might not be genuinely excellent, but it's style, charisma and huge likability send this directly towards a perfect ten.Summary: 5 out of 5 (*****)",10,4,9,31 March 2005
The Patriot," Frickin' propaganda
","Dear lord. When will Americans learn not to glorify their country so much in their films. It really is becoming annoying. 'We Were Soldiers' 'The last Samurai' and 'The Patriot'. Isn't one heroic victory enough. Why not just make a great Japanese film like 'Zatoichi'. Or can you not understand their language? Or are you racist?Well, sure. I watched this, and thought it was good. Good battle scenes. Epic storyline. Very enjoyable. But look at the message. All this film does is try and show how horrible the English were. They may have done some pretty terrible things. But this is just not justified. The most cringe-worthingly annoying scene is in which the climatic battle has all of the epic music playing in the background, whilst Gibson slays all of the 'Filthy' English. Bloody propaganda. Which leaves me to my conclusion.*/ out of ***** (1 and a half out of 5)",3,4,9,27 February 2005
Collateral," What an excellent action movie
","Remember True Lies? Rambo? The Terminator? Great action movies seem hard to come by nowadays, with too many directors cutting all the realism to achieve PG-13 ratings. Well, just get one thing straight. This is not done in Collateral. The result? A magnificent, exciting action classic. Michael Mann, the genius behind 'Ali' and 'Heat' is in the directors chair for this one, again showing his fabulous gift for action sequences, violence and believable dialogue, making Collateral all the more superb. When the violence comes, it's almost perfect; not too grotesque, yet still gritty. And the action sequences- well, there something else. The shootout scene in the club is easily one of the greatest in years. And what else makes Collateral the movie it is? Well, you could say the acting. Jamie Foxx is excellent; remaining calm and believable throughout, yet leaving a haunting feeling with him as his dilemma unfolds. And Tom Cruise, the nasty assassin, as cool as can be, always there to provide the audience with witty one-liners. All in all, this is one of the greatest action movies in the decade; worth a shot, anyway. Overall: ****/ out of ***** (4 and a half out of 5)",9,0,1,22 January 2005
Die Hard 2," Andrenaline pumping, bullet spraying, quick talking action movie... majestic
","I think it is fair to say that in recent years action movies have taken a serious downfall. The late eighties and early nineties introduced us to such great action films like 'Lethal Weapon' 'Die Hard ' 'Predator' and 'Heat'. Nowadays, as was the case with 'S.W.A.T' and 'AVP', directors are cutting the realism to obtain 'box-office' friendly ratings to get a little more cash from a teenage fan base. Not only does that reduce to the pleasure received from the movie, it seems movie-making is turning into more of a 'business' than an 'art' or 'hobby'. But did they do that with 'Die Hard 2'? No. And what do we have? An endlessly superb movie overall.Starting off with quick, smart talking John McLane (Bruce Willis) in an Airport after receiving a parking ticket in a humorous scene, you can clearly see where this is going; it is Christmas, right? But who could have guessed such an excellent sequel would be on the way? Rarely do they surpass their predecessors. But with this case, everything is right. The dialogue is witty, sharp, and superb, the characters (well, most of them) are hugely likable, and surprise after amazing surprise unravels itself in brilliant chase scene after the other, keeping the tension pulsing throughout.

Alien vs. Predator," Why diss this film so much? It may be watered down, but it is very bloody and entertaining
","Ah, at last, comes another 'popcorn' 'PG-13' popcorn flick, for us to watch on a Saturday Night and forget instantly. 'Walking Tall' 'The Ring' and 'What Lies Beneath' all offered some fun, and along comes the next in the batch: a watered down, yet surprisingly gory, 'follow-up' to the much loved alien/predator franchise. You know what to expect; lots of violence, nasty trap and little story. Well, I can proudly say that fans of the originals should not be disappointed. The film may be slight on realism (several times the camera cuts away to get the PG-13 rating) but there remains a lot of violence and gore within to prove fans wrong. And the story may be slightly non-existent (why exactly they battle and get there in the first place is a mystery) but it is an easy, fun, suspenseful way to pass time, definitely worth a rental.

Meet the Fockers," Not a patch on the original
","2000 came. So did comedy classic 'Meet the Parents'. A truly original comedy hoot, director Jay roach bought the 'you know it's gonna be classic' formation of Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro together, as a husband-to-be and very sincere (yet hilarious) overprotective father De Niro. When I heard of a sequel, I wasn't sure at all what to expect. Sure, the original was genius, but sequels usually aren't a patch on their predecessors. As was the case with 'Meet The Fockers'.So, on comes the pairing of 'Gaylord' and 'Pam'. Off to visit her and his parents, they fly across on first class (just everything seems to be going their way) and then, after collecting her parents, are off to his. After meeting over-welcoming 'Bernie' and hilarious sex-therapist 'Roz', we get the general impression where the film is going. At first, the dog-humping joke is funny. But five times later? You get a feeling they're running out of ideas. The sexual jokes are the highlight of the film, but, after a while, they seem to lose their edge. Don't get me wrong, this is a sort-of funny film, but after the outstanding original, this painfully hit-and-miss comedy just doesn't quite cut it.**/ out of ***** (2 and a half out of 5)",5,1,2,5 February 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Gritty, realistic, disturbing and magnificent
","Not that many films have actually been realistic in showing the how utterly disturbing and horrific experience that war is. 'We Were Soldiers' was utter propaganda nonsense, as was 'Black Hawk Down' which solely focused on violence. 'Windtalkers' and 'Tears of the Sun' weren't great either. They didn't try and focus on how utterly disturbing and disgusting the war was, no; they tried to create action-films to be viewed purely as popcorn entertainment and on some levels they succeeded. But Saving Private Ryan was a bar above the rest; a disgusting, realistic, beautiful attempt to show how horrible the war was, also showing as an entertaining movie too. When it's Spielberg, you know it's business.After a stomach-churningly horrific opening 20 minutes, in which limbs are torn and guts are spread across the beach, the film gets right to the point. With one of my favourite actors, Vin Diesel, in the team, they set off after orders to find James Ryan (Matt Damon) as per instructions given to them by an army base. This disturbingly realistic film really shows what hell war is. Not just in the fight scenes (after the first one on the beaches of Normandy they are infrequent) but what depths men have to go in war to complete the task given to them (i.e. trudging on in all conditions) and it realistically portrays the madness of it all. Only Platoon and Apocalypse Now have had anywhere near the effect.Horribly graphic and Tear-jerkingly beautiful, Steven Spielberg creates another timeless masterpiece that will assure that the full 161 minutes stay in the memory for a long, long time.Overall: ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)",Null,1,2,7 January 2005
Schindler's List," Superb
","Last night, after reading many fabulous reviews, I was lucky enough to view Schindlers list, a supposed 'masterpiece' directed by the famous, the fabulous, Steven Spielberg, creating masterpieces such as E.T. and Jurassic park. So I went into this 3 hour epic with high hopes.It starts off rather depressingly, but picks up. Directed beautifully in black and white, to give it a more old fashioned sense, it clearly shows the films class. Schindler's slimy personality is soon introduced (we see he has affairs with more that one women) and cannot promise his estranged wife she is the only one he will truly ever feel for. Then, we are introduced to Ralph Fiennes (Goeth) a rather brutal member of the Nazi party. So both of the characters 'politically incorrect' frames are introduced.The film is simply too long for me to comment on every happening, but it becomes blatantly apparent that this film didn't win 7 academy awards for nothing. Both hopeful and poignant (showing some rather graphic violent scenes as well) this truly is a masterpiece that should be viewed by all.Final summary: ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)",10,9,13,4 January 2005
Hero," Beautifully shot but slightly unsatisfying...
","Anyone seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon? Great film. Anyone seen Hero? Not so great. Not bad, but not as good. Probably worth a viewing, but slightly disappointing. The following review will tell you why. Hero is told as a story, basically about a sword. Sequence after sequence explains what has happened in the life of Nameless (Jet Li). This film is shot beautifully, with perhaps the best cinematography ever. Despite this, it feels slightly unsatisfying whilst being viewed. There is nothing particularly wrong with Yimou Zhang's effort, it just isn't great. And definitely not as good as it should have been. When looking at the poster advertising the film, it looks brilliant. But when watching it you'll find it's not as great. Bizarre really, not for any real particular reason, just not great. Hmmm.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Terribly overdone and melodramatic, but superbly uncut fun
","Where 'Apocalypse' fails, it delivers. I heard someone suggest a 'PG-13' would be favourable as a marketing suggestion, but thank god, that was shoved aside. This is uncut, and because of that, this delivers. Though this may be pretty terrible by and large, it is huge fun to watch. The action sequences deliver incredibly.With no real motive but to get the zombies and humans fighting, the action starts unrealistically but manages to hold the attention. On occasion, this manages to be cool, though the flaws are so unbelievably obvious it seems credit to the director to even pretend they're not there. To much detail is unnecessary, and will probably prove notice to how bad this is.And though the script is simply silly Mike Epps is great to add comedy to the supposedly 'scary' backup. Some of the characters decisions are so utterly ridiculously unexplained it turns into unintentional comedy. The characters have no motives: they're doing the script, nothing more. Oh well.It still manages to be pretty stylish though, but never scary. It is, despite it's constant violence, hardly gory. But it is violent.Forgotten, overdone, melodramatic, terribly scripted... yet curiously enticing.**/ out of **** (2 and a half out of 4)",6,1,2,22 May 2005
The Hurricane," This film isn't biased!
","I admit, I previously wrote an unfair review stating how biased this film was, but I am deciding to replace it. This film isn't very biased. There might be the odd niggly detail here and there, but many of the main 'biased' points aren't actually biased! The main points are below.Point 1: The people who made the film never actually said that the Hurricane beat a molester. That was never implied. That is what Hurricane described in his book; therefore it cannot be biased.Point 2: Delapeche, I admit, was a good cop. He was never called a bad cop, or portrayed as one in the script. Again, this was what Hurricane wrote in his book. The makers of the film never freely incorporated a corrupt or racist cop in the script; only from Hurricanes eyes.Point 3: Maybe he couldn't have achieved so many medals whilst in the army/navy. They never said he did! This was what Hurricane said happened. Had Hurricane never told a story, and this happened in the script, fair enough. But it didn't! Point 4: When the man, dying in hospital, said Hurricane didn't kill the men, in fact said he did. But that is what Hurricane wrote in his book. So it is in fact viewed through the eyes of Hurricane.Get my point???? 10 out of 10 (for everyone who inaccurately dissed it!)",9,3,8,28 March 2005
The Untouchables," Marevellously emotional, powerful, and violent... a huge achievement
","Who would have thought a man, Brian De Palma, make a gangster film as good as Scarface? Not many, maybe: but no-one whosoever would predict that he made a better one, within five years, especially. But he did, and in doing so, he created the perfect gangster movie: passionate, stylish and emotionally jerking, this is both stunningly graphic and surprisingly beautiful.1930's, Chicago. Al Capone (played superbly by De Niro) proudly proclaims what a success he is, and that he is in no way involved with any illegal shipments of alcohol, or any violent crime. He denies, very strongly, that he does not kill anyone who refuses to buy his products.The next day, Chicago: a little girl goes to boil her water in a local pub, and the owner refuses to a man dressed in white to buy any liquor. He 'accidently' leaves behind his briefcase. The girl notices, and runs out to give it to him, but before she even gets out, the briefcase explodes in her face, as well as destroying the whole pub. The man gets in his car and drives away.Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner, his best performance) is a cop, a recent signing to the Chicago law enforcement team. He's a treasury officer, and on arrival with this news of the bombing, he becomes more eager to get Capone. A meeting with the mother (in an extremely heartfelt scene-trust me, you won't be expecting to cry so early on) really shows him what this man, Capone, is doing to the city. He's a crook, and he must be stopped.But his first assignment is a complete bust. Instead of picking up the alcohol, he gets the umbrellas, and becomes the laughing stock of the whole department. Not only does this hugely embarrass Ness, it fuels Capone to hilarity- thus is the start of a feud that will end more than one life...This film is superb on so many levels. As well as the action set pieces being excellent (if surprisingly violent- for its time, how did this get a UK '15' certificate) but it also has a majestic and epic feel to it. The emotions of both sides are shown and played out marvellously- particularly when Irish Cop Malone (Sean Connery) comes into the picture.Perhaps the most shocking scene, in ways, is the best. As Al Capone mercilessly beats the head in of a fellow 'family' member, and the blood spills across the table cloth, it really proves this is no popcorn picture. Fans of gory films will be pleased, but in some ways subdued. This is not gory for fun, or to push boundaries- this is gory to show in what graphic details these psychopaths will go through.An achievement that stands tall, 'The Untouchables' is a classic. This is very tense, very violent and very emotive: a must see, and the best picture 'De Palma' has done.",9,2,4,4 January 2005
Mystic River," Chilling, effective and real
","After a while, one has come to expect mediocrity from Clint Eastwood. 'Blood Work' 'Space Cowboys' and 'Sudden Impact' all shining examples of this. But what he has here is true; sophisticated, intricate and rewarding. Viewing is definitely recommended.Three boys, Dave (Tim Robbins) Jimmy (Sean Penn) and Sean (Kevin Bacon) are reunited after the murder of Jimmy's nineteen year-old daughter. Immediately, a whodunit case arrives. Sounds average, dunnit?...No. It's much more than average. What might appear as a normal murder mystery is more. The acting, particularly from Robbins and Penn, is immaculate. Robbins is still recovering from child sexual abuse along time ago. Penn, so realistically and amazingly, mourns over the loss of his daughter. Laurence Fishburne (playing cop Whitey) is as smart talking as ever, whilst Kevin Bacon gives a solid performance as the homicide cop investigating the case.Though the film becomes a bit uneven towards the end, this tough, brutal and uncompromising; but still, a masterpiece, and the best work Eastwood as done in years.Final Analysis: 9 out of 10",9,126,213,24 April 2005
War of the Worlds," A weak ending, but a truly terrifying preceding hour and a half make this well worth it
","*May contain a slight spoiler* Steven Spielberg can be a bit of a mystery. He can be the brains behind happy, comedic films such as 'The Terminal' and 'Catch Me if You Can' or the brains behind distressing, utterly violent films such as 'Jurassic Park' or 'Saving Private Ryan'. Or, he can be the genius behind horror films 'Minority Report' 'Jaws' and yes, 'War of The Worlds.' Well, Minority Repor was creepy. Jaws was tense, and made you wonder. What about War of The Worlds? Well, in my opinion, downright terrifying.A warning to parents first (living in either the UK or USA). Take no notice to the 'PG-13' or '12A' rating. Honestly. I was shocked. There simply is some material here that is totally and utterly inappropriate for children. Not even the much raved about 'blood-sucking tentacles' the fact that a father and young child- scrap that- the whole world, is in terrible danger. I can imagine being eight and being absolutely scared out of my pants. Communities are destroyed, as freakishly big aliens cause chaos. Even as an older person, it makes you ask questions- is it possible? In conclusion, no, but this film takes an impossible thing and turns it into an utterly terrifying trip full of death, horror and blood.However, that wasn't a bad description of the films horror. It sets out to scare you, and does, be it in a tense way or with sometimes ear-shattering unexpected pace. If it's not whole cities being demolished, it certainly is a poor family of two in a basement with a weirdo getting menacingly pursued by blood sucking tentacles and rather frank pictures of aliens.I would've given this film perfect marks, were it not for the ending. It wraps it up with a totally impossible happy ending that really does wonder what Steven Spielberg was thinking. Not only was the ending impossible, too much is left unexplained, as if the director had to rush to cram it all in into 15 minutes. Despite that, this really is a scary, scary film.***/ out of **** (3 and a half out of 4)",9,0,1,10 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lots of special effects and brutal fighting
","*Possible spoilers below* Much better than the boredom and confusion of 'The Phantom Menace', much more accomplished and exciting than the tedium of 'attack of the clones' and much better than any star wars movie (ever!) 'Revenge of the Sith' is a fitting end (or beginning) to the original masterworks done all those years ago.Epileptics, sincerely, beware: the first 20 or so minutes may just have been the brightest I have ever seen on film, and I've seen a few. That does not take away the appealing nature of it, however, as Anakin and Obi fight for justice in some truly magnificent and very dark locations. Some brutal fights come shortly also...Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith isn't great. It's brilliant. The excitement pumps fully through to the end. The film simply is epic, and better than any other Star Wars movie. And, what a shame (ironically enough) the only thing that makes this film just below perfect marks is the ending. A fitting ending would be after Obi leaves Anakin to die and shrivel up by the volcano. Instead, ending after ending ensues giving the film a rather messy feel.Regardless, it's better done and just plain better than any Star Wars movie, and a shoe-in for Top 10 of the year.***/ out of ****",9,2,5,26 June 2005
Platoon," Powerful but flawed
","Platoon puts films like 'We Were Soldiers' 'Tears of the Sun' and 'Windtalkers' to shame. And considering Platoon isn't the best war film of all time, or even excellent, that is saying a lot.But I'm not writing this review to blaspheme those films. I'm writing to inform; and, if you are willing to view this film, information is required. OK, no: Platoon is not the best war film ever made, or even close. But what it lacks it just about makes up for, with a great script, superb performances from anybody involved and a very emotive anti-war message (for part of the film, anyway).Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a newcomer to the war. Living a reasonably middle class life, he joined up, seeing as he was 'educated', to defy expectations of his parents. But he gets more than he bargained for as early as the first week, and that's not even the half of it.It takes a while for all the real atrocities to appear, but when they do, they really are atrocious. Particularly in a gut-wrenching scene where a man's face is literally reduced to pulp by the end of a gun.It isn't perfect, however, no matter how ambitious; despite all of the above, I still think a deeper insight was completely necessary. This film being little less than two hours with the amount of explosions that there were proves my point. And if not a little short lived, this film can't really decide what it wants to be; sure, it shows all the horrible things in war, but rather contradicts itself; in the end scene, you realise this film is just as much pro as against. This really does take away some of the effect.However, at least it isn't sentimental. The sad music does occasionally appear to frequently and in the wrong places, but that can be forgiven. One question to end though: will I remember Platoon? Despite the occasional brilliance and truly powerful scenes, I cannot be sure. If you asked me that about another war film, 'Saving Private Ryan' the answer was a definite yes. The difference is obvious.8 out of 10",8,1,4,7 May 2005
The Matrix," The greatest action sci fi ever
","This really is a sci fi action masterpiece to be truly appreciated and watched over and over again. All though it is endlessly complex, and still dragged down by its two poor sequels, this still is an original and brilliant piece of kick ass action and story. Starting off with pirating criminal Neo (Reeves) he is getting bizarre messages on his computer and having many strange encounters. Particularly in one scene where he is tracked down at his work by some very unfriendly looking criminals... Then we really are shown what a fantastic film this is. After a scene (wince) where he is injected with a bug, and then taken out as he travels naked and skinless through a watery world, we see some incredibly done 'special-effects' scenes, as well as brilliantly original fight scene with Morpheous... This may be very long, but it never, ever loses its touch. It pulses with fantastic action and violent scenes throughout, whilst the complex story adds to the package. Very, very good.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the greatest movies of all time
","This is one of the most superb, inventive movies of ever. Truly a landmark title. A miracle of the times. I was lucky enough to acquire the Star Wars Trilogy, and see these three epic classics remastered. Well, all I can say is it was well worth the money.When this hit the screens in 1977, in had the world in shock. The special effects were incredible for the time, and are decent enough now, almost 30 years later. A miraculous classic, Star Wars should be viewed by everybody who has ever heard of the sacred word 'film'. Starting off with a great Sci-fi battle sequence, the precious Princess Leia has Empire Secrets and is captured and held on a massive Empire ship. This epic film follows the quest of some truly memorable characters; the timid Luke Skywalker, the arrogant Hand Solo and his truly loyal Chewbacca, Darth Vader and of course, who could forget R2-D2 and C-3PO?A stunningly fantastic sci-fi action-adventure, Star Wars is one of the greatest films of all time. 5 stars all round.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Best of the lot
","After seeing the first Star Wars, a Sci-fi epic set in outer-space (which I loved) I was looking forward to tuning in to the second in the trilogy (the empire strikes back) on DVD, but, to be honest, I didn't really think it could get any better. The first star wars was perfect, and, usually, the first in a series is the best. How could that great film be surpassed?Well, one word: sheer genius. Unknown director Irvin Kershner steps into the Director's chair and directs an outstanding, phenomenal sequel, that is full of many surprises and memorable acting. This part of the trilogy see's Han Solo on-board the ship with Chewbacca, Princess Leia and C-3PO. It also see's Luke travel deep into Dagobah with R2-D2 to seek out Jedi Master Yoda. This excellent film simply cannot be put into words. Everything is right, everything just clicks. It's a film of all kinds: so well done and executed yet so entertaining. Such a work of art yet such a popcorn film for a night in. Any way you look at it, this is a true piece of devoted work that should and is showered with deserved praise all across the globe.Final Summary: ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)",10,0,1,7 January 2005
Braveheart," Just about the best acted and most exciting film ever
","It's hard to believe 'Braveheart' a fantastic, emotional and hugely involving film, is ten years old. I only realised yesterday, when I re watched it, and noticed what a splendid film it is: not yet has there been a sword/medieval film so emotionally involving, brutal with a true message. Lame recent attempts such as 'Troy' haven't shown this, and don't even get me talking about the dreadfully box-office aimed 'King Arthur'; this is a great revenge flick, and an even better medieval sword classic.Mel Gibson is just a small child named William when his father dies. Already the film has your emotions running. Then, when he is an adult, his wife, whom he obviously deeply loves, is raped, beaten and killed, all in horrific detail. What a light opening thirty minutes.No. This film isn't light. If you expected some clichÃ©d fairytale classic you were wrong. This is stark, brutal cold: a mean, but effect, medieval film.So William kills them all in surprisingly brutal fashion (pushing the bars of the films '15' certificate) and immediately changes his choice of revenge; he now wants to free the whole of Scotland.His unexplained change in motives is fine. No-body cares since the sets are so realistic, so well done, you feel you are taken into this world. Mel Gibson acts with all emotion, as do the others: they really do, in their own modern lives, probably want some freedom. It may sound preposterous, but how on earth could these actors act so convincingly? Maybe Merlin waved his wand and had a say?The fights are brutal, graphic, squeamish may well want to look away. But it is commendable and fine enough. Gibson, who directs, wants to show how terrible, dirty and down right insane these times were. He even admits, as his character, that both sides are savages. Despite the bias is towards Scotland, it carefully weaves in another message: no side is better, or right or wrong.The love story between Gibson and the French princess may be a little short and unnecessary, but it can be forgiven.***/ out of **** (3 and a half out of 4)",9,3,5,29 May 2005
Coach Carter," Sentimental but very entertaining
","How do you top the career of Sam Jackson, a classic actor who has been in many superb films all around for years. 'Pulp Fiction' 'Jackie Brown' and the 'Negotiator' were all excellent, but in recent years it seemed as if he had simply scrapped all of that, and taken any offer that came his way, no matter how poor the material. 'Swat' and 'Basic' are perfect examples. So how does good old Sam get on top of his game again? He signs up for a fresh new film like 'Coach Carter'. Targeting the career of 'Ken' and his quest to make the 'hood' peaceful again and giving all the 'hardcore' gangsters goals, you can tell this is a pro-education film just dripping with sentimentality. The only problem is: these guys just ain't gangster enough. OK, there is no denying, Coach Carter targeted the market; a smart move, fair enough. But in doing so they created a relatively pretentious view of a 'rough' neighbourhood, with teens who don't act hard and don't speak hard. Bad language may not be completely necessary, but it certainly would of added to the realism here. That aside, this film is very entertaining, and, for a short while, almost really good; but here and there the corny side creeps up, particularly in a horribly clichéd, unnecessary scene where young hood member 'Cruz' proves his worth to the team. It is literally cringe-worthy. So all in all, Coach Carter is not great film. Had I reviewed this on the basis of how well and how realistically this film was done, I'd probably give it about a 1, but this was a fun, popcorn flick that is good for a short period but drags on eventually. Maybe good enough for a re-watch. ***/ out of ***** (3 and a half out of 5)",Null,0,1,26 February 2005
Back to the Future," A lot of fun, but not as good as everyone says
","Me and a friend watched this on T.V. recently for about half an hour and didn't really think much of it, so we watched something else. I got some reviews (and I know it was more of a landmark when it first came out) so I watched it again. It was getting a perfect '10' everywhere I went. So just yesterday I watched the whole thing again, and enjoyed it a lot more. It was more funny, more entertaining, and plain better. Maybe I hadn't been in the mood for it the first time. But I was now and it was good; mixing cheeky humour with action and tension: sure it's a good film. But nowhere near perfect. I know this may seem hard to take in, but this is how it is: there is nothing particularly wrong with this picture, it just isn't amazing. That is the whole truth, up front, pure and simple. 8.
