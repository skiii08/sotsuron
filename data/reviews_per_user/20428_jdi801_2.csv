First Man," Horrible
","How do you take the most historic event
In the history of mankind, and make so boring as to be unwatchable. Well, they managed. I'm old enough to remember the actual events, The the news announcers were more exciting than this.Then there's a multitude of technical goofs. So much shaking of the X-15 and spacecraft, they should have come apart in reality. The Gemini capsule that looked and sounded like an old rust bucket. Squeaking doors? Dirt around rivets? The mission control computers with graphics? Not in those days. Armstrong didn't take his daughters bracelet to the moon and leave it, that was an outright fallacy.The endless unsteady cam doesn't work, never works, and annoys the heck out of the viewer. Well it does make the movie look like it was produced by 14 year olds. The dialog is lame and uninspired. No character development, in fact the whole movie lacks character overall.This movie is as entertaining as watching a dirt cold crumble.",2,1,3,22 July 2019
The Hunger Games," Headache
","Worst cinematography in the history of motion pictures, including Cloverfield. SAY NO TO SHAKY CAMS! Had a splitting headache by the time the movie was over, and there won't be a DVD sale later because of it.No character development of any kind. It's really hard to care about these people when they left out the first handful of chapters in the book that describe the world they live in, and how they cope with it, and their relationships. And then they leave out the last few chapters showing how Katniss, Peeta, Prim, Haymitch, the mother, and even Buttercup dealt with the after effects of winning and the homecoming.Just throw the action out there, make it impossible to focus on anything because of crap camera direction, and I'm supposed to be happy with the exorbitant prices at the theater? Knock off the avant garde camera crap, and give us a movie people can watch.",3,11,15,8 April 2012
