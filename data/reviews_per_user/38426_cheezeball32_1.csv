The New World," I also registered with IMDb just to give this a 1 star rating
","I think of myself of having a fairly good taste for movies and I have to say this is one of the worst, if not the worst movie I have ever seen. Like other people have said I tried to appreciate it's artistic value but it was so bland I could not help feeling extremely bored. There was very little dialog and lots of scenes with people running through tall grass in slow motion. The editing was absolutely awful; at one point there is a random cut to a canoe in a lake for absolutely no reason (among other poor editing choices). I'm glad I picked this up at Blockbuster with a free movie rental pass instead of wasting my hard earned movie on a movie ticket for this catastrophe. I could have watched this movie in 3x speed on DVD and not missed anything at all.",1,1,5,1 May 2010
