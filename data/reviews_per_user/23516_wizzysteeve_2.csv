Resident Evil: Afterlife," A sad time for resident evil fans...
","OK I'm not going to lie when I say I was looking forward to this instalment of the resident evil series. However I must stress this point, that all writers and producers have lost there imagination when it comes to film nowadays. Its sad nobody can actually come up with a brand new film, nearly all aspects are taken from other things. An example being resident evil afterlife, I do understand it is heavily based on the game series but that does not mean, you can just copy every little aspect that made the game series cool. For example resident evil afterlife took the executioner from resident evil 5 (the game).The four pronged mouthy people, from resident evil 5, and the dogs that kind of split into two from (yeah you guessed) resident evil 5. Talk about unimaginative, but the thing that annoyed me the most about this new film was, as I'm sure fans are aware Jill valentine is in the film at the end (clip during credits), in resident evil apocalypse she is brunette, in the early resident evil games she is brunette also, but in resident evil 5 she goes blonde, then in resident evil afterlife she is blonde. This sounds like a weak argument I know but! at the end of the film I heard people in the cinema going 'Whos that?' now if hardcore fans of the film do not recognise Jill Valentine who has been in the game series since the beginning and has been a major character throughout the whole of resident evil games and films. Something has gone wrongOther irritating things were the never ending slow motion shots to show off the power of the so called 'impressive 3D graphics' but the developers got so immersed they forgot to write a script that made sense. Leaving huge plot wholes like how Wesker and Alice could both survive a head long crash into a mountain, (and yes they are super humans) but even so very stupid idea. Also the never ending clich√© lines and shots of the characters throwing guns in slow motion, and Wesker having is little gloat before he does anything even remotely evil, just annoyed me to the point of where I wanted to take my 3D glasses off and pretend I was watching the first resident evil film again. I was interested in how they were going to make a new story without making it terrible after ending the 3rd film with an clone army of Alices, but it seems they didn't even attempt to, all the Alice clones are killed off within the first 30mins of the film, so they could start the plot from scratch without it getting to ridiculous.My next comment isn't strictly to do with the film but actually the adverts before hand. Having seen the endless comments of films coming out soon and after everyone, hearing 3D 3D 3D 3D I just got annoyed. Producers and writers of the world especially you! James Cameron listen up! stop getting excited about 3D! Maybe for young children's films its OK but for hardcore film fans like myself, who are very critical about which films we watch, its terrible! just come up with a good plot at the moment only one producer seems to be able to do this and that is Quentin Tarantino, inglorious bastards was the last exceptionally good film I had seen in recent years. I was so angry when his film didn't get much credit during the BAFTA awards because his film was apparently over- shadowed by avatar which was tremendously overrated because of the endless praise for 3D. Has film really got to the point where producers end up comparing who has the best graphics. Rather than sitting down and thinking of a good film! I remember the old days where people ended films because they didn't want to spoil the series. Nowadays its all money money money a fourth terminator which wasn't needed! A remake to predator which also wasn't needed! and now a fourth resident evil film. Just stop please!!",4,5,12,12 September 2010
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," excellent to watch once..
","Before I start I would just like to say on know account is this a bad film. I found it hilarious in almost every respect. However it is only funny once, after seeing it you know where all of the surprises are and as the sketches are so memorable, it is hard to forget the jokes. Making it less humorous the second time you watch it. I feel that the life of Brian is a better Monty python film. The holy grail seems less focused, and the pythons have really gone out of there way to put as many small jokes into this film as possible, but there aren't that many that make you scream with laughter.As a one off comedy film you cannot get much better than this, but my patience for this film has lead me to the point where I refuse to watch it for a year or so before watching it again. So you have been warned its fun but don't wear it out..",7,2,5,24 July 2010
