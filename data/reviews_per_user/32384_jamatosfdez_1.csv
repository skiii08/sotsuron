Ford v Ferrari," A beautiful film
","I have to say that I'm by no means a racing fan. I came into the movie with relatively low expectations (mostly because I found the name lame) even being such a Bale and Damon fan.What I found was a beautiful film that gets to be intimate, profound and sincere at moments. A film with an impeccable sound mixing, a thrilling OST that submerges you into the race and conveys a feeling of weightlessness, freedom and victory I hadn't felt in a long time.I profoundly recommend it to everyone reading this, specially for racing fans, as I've heard it's really faithful to the true story it's based on.",8,1,2,1 March 2020
