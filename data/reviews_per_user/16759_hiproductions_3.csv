Casablanca," has truly lived up to its reputation as a dramatic film for the ages.
","This film is one of the best classic pictures I have ever seen. An interesting story line and compelling performances are what I found so attractive about this movie. Kudos to Curtiz. The set was nearly perfect and was very convincing. I felt the heat of the Moroccan town as the camera swept through the markets in the streets. I was amazed to hear that this was shot almost entirely in a Hollywood studio. I wouldn't have noticed unless I was told otherwise. The song 'As Time Goes By' was moving even to a former punk/grunge rocker like myself which says something for its power.The topic is very interesting in that it deals with the mystery and intrigue of WWII and the efforts to defeat Nazi tyranny. A beautiful love story was also mixed in with the political refugee plot which held my interest for the entire length of the film. The dialogue was excellent, the best I've seen from the era. This picture was so well written and directed that it would have been great without big name actors and actresses but it was because of the big name cast that it has become the timeless classic that it is.Humphrey Bogart as 'Rick' was stellar in his performance. I believed the character to be a heart-broken man embittered and buried in self-pity all hidden under the mask of congeniality. This mask is rudely removed by a bottle of liquor. 'You played it for her you can play it for me!' is only one memorable and dynamic line from this movie that launched the Bogart cult and mystique.Ingrid Bergman as 'Ilsa' was adorable. I could easily see why two men would both share a common love for her. I was enamored by her delivery and found myself sympathizing with both Rick and Lazlo for losing or almost losing her. This movie has sparked in me an interest for the work of Ingrid Bergman.This was a film I would recommend for anyone who loves the cinema. It has truly lived up to its reputation as a dramatic film for the ages.",8,2,5,27 May 2005
Citizen Kane," There is a reason this is a MUST SEE for all Cinephiles
","Orson Welles effectively employed writing, cinematography, mis en scene, directing, sound, editing, acting, and even ideology to bring us his masterpiece Citizen Kane.This script was written to provide an immediate 'button' by which we're engaged to continue watching. The button is an old man dying, dropping a glass ball, and uttering the word 'Rosebud'. This soon becomes, what Hitchcock called, 'The Mcguffin', an object, in this case 'information', that is pursued throughout the picture. The audience, like the reporter on the screen, becomes curious to find out who or what 'rosebud' is. Another element of writing that was used effectively was the exposition of the newspaper tycoon's back story via a newsreel and at other times the newspaper headline. A great use of subtext was displayed in the wife's constant building of jigsaw puzzles. It was a metaphor for the life of Kane and the jigsaw builder was the reporter. Cinematography and mis en scene worked together to give the picture a timeless quality that allows for a film student to be taken back to the early 20th century and experience Kane's life in the first person. The smoke-filled rooms and silhouettes of the news guys make us feel like they are in the theater with us while conferring and asking their questions. Close ups and soft lighting allow us to feel comfortable with Kane as he falls in love with the 'singer'. The mis en scene of the Kane mansion was excellent (for that time). I had difficulty determining if the establishing shot of the large mansion was an actual house or just a painted set. The dramatic point of the movie when Kane was tearing apart Susan's (Dorothy Comingmore) bedroom was perfectly dressed and perfectly destroyed before our eyes. Other moments of mis en scene: Kane as a boy in the setting of pure white snow bespeaks his innocence. The crowded room of statues at the end had me looking closely to determine if any of the statues were genuine! Another noteworthy mention is Orson Welles makeup, however much he wore, was so realistic it was frightening. He looked as he did at his ACTUAL late age prior to his passing.Sound and editing worked well together to bolster the drama of many scenes in this film. From the scary, sad music establishing the Kane mansion and Kane's death to the screech of a cockatiel marking his wife's departure, sound was a consistent element of dramatic support. The continual audio overlaps like Kane's clapping for Susan's private performance to the public applause of his nomination, laughter that steals in as Susan attempts to perform her operetta, a scream from a party outside the room as Kane slaps her, and the shrill shriek of the cockatiel as she leaves Kane, all made for great exposition. Also, the deep resonating echoes in the Kane mansion tell us how open, cold, and lonely the house must have been.Editing was smart and, as the great editing genius Dmytrk taught, invisible. Economic use of quick cuts and swish pans during the Dinner table scene between Kane and Mary, transitions from Kane and Susan in her room, to Kane and his political friends at his nomination, and from this to his grand public acceptance speech allowed for much information and the passing of time to be delivered effectively and quietly.William Randolph Hearst, the famous newspaper tycoon, whom this film is purported to portray, was so insulted by its similarities to his life, he banned its mention in any of his many newspapers (sounds like something Kane would do). According to Dr. Jack K. Ringler, historian and professor of history at CCSN, Mr. Hearst was widely known to use his newspapers to stir up agitation from the American public towards the Spanish government just prior to the Spanish-American war. This, Hearst believed, made for good stories and GREAT circulation. The fact that Kane is found to harp on his editors and writers declaring, 'We will go to war against Spain' clearly demonstrates Welles' ideology through his character Kane, whose life, at the very least, parallels Mr. Hearst's. The ideology of twisted news reporting that is bent to flow the way of the personal views of the media 'owners' (i.e. Ted Turner) clearly comes across throughout the movie. Kane's declaration, 'I determine what the people need to hear' exemplifies the media's ability (and sometimes willingness) to editorialize instead of report fact.The directing of Citizen Kane was so tight that it is difficult to believe that it was accomplished by a 1st-time director, and by a director that acted the lead role at the same time! His choice to make an unorthodox choice of staging, acting, editing, and framing the dinner table scenes with his wife Mary (Agnes Moorhead), his movement and blocking of actors in the opera performance scenes, and his presentation of the Hearst/Kane dwelling were brave for 1941! His vision of the finished piece is the only explanation for the successful integration of so many film elements.",8,2,7,8 May 2005
Singin' in the Rain," best film musical of all time?! I don't think so G.
","I watched this film with the expectation that it would have a good storyline that would keep my interest like Oliver, My Fair Lady, or at least Mary Poppins. I was sorely disappointed. This film has been called 'the best' film musical of all time. I do not share that opinion.The characters were campy. Gene Kelly was far too happy all the time and it made it very difficult for me to watch him. The dumb blonde played by Jean Hagen was an exception. I found her to be very funny (apparently so did Frank Loesser in that he plagiarized her character in his musical 'How to Succeed at Business Without Really Trying'.) The supporting cast was fair and Debbie Reynolds was competent but I really see no reason to rave about this musical.I would take Fred Astaire over Gene Kelly any day for choreography. The story is rudely and abruptly interrupted by this ridiculous 'vision' that Kelly has where he is suddenly on Broadway or at a burlesque show and this horrible dance sequence that lasted forever, all in the name of his character finding a good ending to their swashbuckling movie. From swashbuckler to Broadway is a bit of a stretch. Speaking of stretch, visions shouldn't take up half a movie in MY book.This movie was genuinely bad. I am sorry that this is considered a classic. I guess we can look for future generations to hail the Beegee's and Peter Frampton for their 'ingenious' work when they name 'Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' a musical 'classic' as well. After I saw 'Singin' In The Rain' I could clearly see why the musical genre took a steep dive back then.",2,26,55,27 May 2005
