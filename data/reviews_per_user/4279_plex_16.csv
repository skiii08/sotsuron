Ali," Waited a long time...for nothing
","I put off seeing this film for a long time, and finally watched it 12/12/09 to see what the Oscar hype was about Will Smiths' performance before he became and A-listed, self assuming smug actor. This film is a complete mess from top to bottom, start to finish. I recognize Smith had a daunting task to portray one of the 20th century's most outspoken and beloved characters, along with mimicking Ali's boxing style. This role must have taken much studying and preparation both physically and mentally. But this is where my appreciation begins and ends. I ask how is it possible to take one of modern history's most flamboyant athlete and morph him into a boring, unfocused, character? Unfortunately, Will Smith found a way.I'm not sure if I was supposed to be viewing a docudrama or flat out drama as the story telling and directing were never focused. The story and pace endlessly meander in different directions without resolve. I never got any sense of who Ali was or what he really felt as the character development and script were vague at best. As a mater of fact, I sort of left the film liking Muhamad less. The film has no climax at all with no sense of triumph throughout. The script was boring, and the boxing scenes were poorly shot and edited. The music didn't help either as it was a total snooze-fest with poor song choices and uninspired underscore which added no 'punch' or dramatic support to propel the plodding visual pace. The other characters were paper thin cartoon types- especially those of Don KIng and Drew Brown. Even the closing comments at the films' end was vague citing his marriage failures. Who cares? Not me and certainly not about this waste of a film that does not due any type of justice to Ali. If you want to see a good boxing movie- see Cinderella Man, Raging Bull or Killer's Kiss. If you want to see a good character portrayal based on an actual person, see Patton, My Left Foot, or Queen Elizabeth. This film missed on both affronts.",3,2,3,12 December 2009
A Star Is Born," Did we really need 3 versions of this?
","As a career musician, I approach any film that chronicles the music industry and/or known act with pre-disposed bias and skepticism. After all, aside from family, I take what I do, what I spend my time and make endless sacrifices for, very seriously, and am instantly insulted when film makers show disrespect to the craft by abandoning basic musical principles and adhering to tired and inaccurate oft used cliches. I have respect for both Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, its hard to deny before coming to this, they have long-established themselves as very talented individuals. I also have respect for people who are not career musicians attempting to capture the essence of musicians and mimic their mechanics whether it be by singing or playing an instrument. Some film makers wisely stay away from those details when they realize they cant pull them off; Bohemian Rhapsody being a good example, Behind the Candelabra perhaps being another one. I also have to be carefully guarded, right from the start, against any film that shamelessly calls itself 'A Star Is Born'. Films of this nature easily become self-aware and self-indulgent.These days, the popular music industry isn't what it used to be, nor is the attitude of the average fan. Music has devolved to be free, industrial, mechanical, non-dynamic, and disposable, with a short shelf-life and abated connection between artist and fan. Consumption dollars are primarily towards live entertainment as there is no product except a ticket stub and a T-shirt. This doesn't upset me, not really, rock has been over-valued since the 70's, and everything that needed to be said about that genre has been said many times, to the point where critics, desperate to keep their jobs and hide their envy, consistently try to intellectualize something that is innately stupid. If being a rock star was so special, we certainly have had a lot of them, haven't we? There's a half-a-million more in the wings that merely a flick of the wrist being all that separates them from obscurity and fame. I was wondering at the onset, how much homage they would visit to either of the 2 preceding versions of this story. They wasted no time in making a jab at Bab's nose. Then the film continued its long course of one improbability after another, without realizing it IS those string of improbabilities that ARE/FUEL the cliche, the phantom character of the film. Don't get me wrong, the film resonates priority one, it draws you in. We're already familiar to Coopers work in film, we have high expectations. Lady Gaga's presence is fresh in this medium by comparison (although she was awesome in American Horror Story seasons 5 & 6, so a continuance in film seemed expected and assumed). She's got that natural magnetism that draws you in; you WANT to watch her. What se CANT do yet, as an actor, is hide her pain and vulnerability. This is a woman who trusted someone who deeply hurt her, its in her eyes, the way she walks, meanwhile trying to fool us into thinking she's the girl next door. She's anything but, something you'd think success would have taught her by now, but she still hasn't let her past go, still remains chained to the mast. Sam Elliot delivers a strong performance, and it was great seeing Andrew Dice Clay and Dave Chapelle so removed from their wheelhouse, I have always thought comedic people should always do drama after they got established in comedy. The directing style is a little claustrophobic for my taste, the pacing and dynamics a bit muted too. The film is a little slow and understated. This isn't to say ASIB is a bad film, far from it. There are a huge amount of Cooper/Gaga fans, as well as a huge entertainment-base who will be curious and embrace the film just on general principle alone. For me, its a bit predictable, tidy, and uneccesary.",7,0,5,25 February 2019
Terminator Salvation," DID anyone notice the music?
","The writers credit said Danny Elfman, but folks that was no Elfman score, not even close to his styling and it was buried under the sound FX (which were excellent BTW) and when have you ever heard a Elfman score buried? I'd bet money he subbed this one out.Anyway I'm only adding more text to get it posted. I am sure everything that could and should be said about T-4 has been said already.I AM glad it got a lot of negative reviews as it lowered my expectations and heightened my enjoyment.Michael Ironside had no business being in this flick, he really cheapened it.",7,2,4,11 June 2009
BlacKkKlansman," Too neat, dumbed-down, and pretty.
","Spike condescends his audience by dumbing-down the narrative in his latest mainstream project.
The premise is solid: a burgeoning revolution in the war against racism, and the elevated actions on either side to actualize results. It's not obvious to me if the 'true' story wasn't being introduced NOW to show the obvious parallel to Trump, or if it was a docudrama period-piece to be consumed on its own merit.
There is some high-quality film making here, especially the camera work, staging and a lot of production techniques. Good editing. The capable ensemble had to contend with a script that is a bit stiff and cliched replete with cartoonish characters. Ron Stallworth and Flip Zimmerman are not very credible. Stallworth, a black rookie cop in a time when black cops were frowned upon within the force, seemingly knows more than the rest of his superiors, and is given command over investigative force mere weeks after being a file clerk. His voice sounds nothing like Zimmermans but apparently it fools everyone, including David Duke who prides himself on detecting black dialect. All of the white characters are written as morons which is typical in Spike films. Granted, I don't have much love for the white characters in this film, but some of them are so far over the top Like Andy Landers and Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard, plus a character who borders on being completely mentally challenged who I can't find on the IMDB cast list. Everything seems to fall into place for our protagonist Stallworth, even the end when Landers gets busted out of the blue and completely out of context, to cross some perverbial-T. It was a loose-end that didn't need to be tied. One bright spot: Harry Belafonte makes an appearance to give a history lesson into the atrocities of the Klan and their acceptance into southern white culture, is disturbing, but again, watered-down and grandstanding. Spike needs to take bigger risks with his film-making and stop worrying that he's going to piss-off the wrong white person who green-lights his films, and just go for it, he's got the chops, he simply needs to get himself dirty. As it stands, he's to neat and pretty.",6,8,14,12 January 2019
The Bourne Ultimatum," Sit at the back of the theater
",I sat about 40 feet from the screen and could not see the fight or chase scenes. Why? Apparently it's really 'hip' to employ UNsteadicam now. The camera was constantly moving randomly as if the 'steady' part of the steadicam apparatus had been removed. There's hardly a fixed camera or dolly shot in the entire movie. The constant close-ups made this 'nervous' movement even more distracting and indiscernible. I can only see viewing this on a home screen or in the back of the theater.The director should have taken into account when you blow up the picture you amplify any camera movements exponentially.Sort of ruined the film for me.,7,24,49,5 August 2007
U-571," MANY reviewers are flat out wrong!
","If you don't like war films, fine. But don't comment on history facts unless you know what your are talking about. This isn't a documentary or even a docudrama. This is an action/drama MOVIE! Fact: Special OP forces recovered several enigma-type of devices during WWII, and used this information against the Germans. Did the enigma decoders win the war? Of course not, but in my opinion it doesn't diminish its significance. I urge the reviewers who posted ignorant opinions as fact to read about the Enigma, the Ultra, and the impact it had on the war with our allied forces (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine)Back to the MOVIE. I love this film: the characters are real, there's no posing or cartoon cliché's. The script, like the story, is no-nonsense, simple and focused. The directing is superb and the sound-design is first rate. The suspense is palpable, really drew me in and kept me there. Its easy to see why it had so many (9) Oscar nomination. The film, in general, sort of was never on the radar ( pun intended) very long, and didn't garner the interest I felt it deserved.",Null,3,10,18 September 2011
Quantum of Solace," Dark Bond kicks it 'Old School'
","As we discovered in 'Casino' the production team pushed the reset button on the Bond empire, building up from scratch with an 'old school' approach to story telling and character interaction/development. This apparent new mantra is continued in this latest installment almost to the point of being self-aware about it. There are no gadgets, lavish sets or overly improbable situations. The villain is water profiteer for a small 3rd world country- hardly the Spectre vibe. Even the overall look of the film seems dated and Bond is quite often unquaffed and sullied along with the gratuitous femme fatale. Having said that, I found the story to be solid but not well told. There are many actions scenes (of course) but all of them were shot at extremely close range with rapid editing and dizzying camera movement leaving me to ponder in each of these scenes what was really going on. We know that Bond virtually wins every battle,i.e. we KNOW the outcome. But as a good story teller , the director needs to convey to the viewer HOW these battles are waged, but it never comes across. I still feel Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery but part of Bond's charm is that he never takes himself too serious and has occasional amusing quips- the writers don't allow for any of this with Craig's character development. Lastly, the premise that Bond is on a revenge trip is extremely downplayed and not the cornerstone of the story we have been led to believe. Will be just as effective on DVD.",7,2,3,20 November 2008
Wreck-It Ralph," Best animated feature film of 2012
","This film is fantastic! I was sadly disappointed the academy did not share my opinion as it being the best animated film of 2012. Its got it all: excellent story, great VO talent, superb animation, focused pacing, sound design, music ( no Randy Newman, thank you very much!). Even as an adult I was surprised at the plot twist at the end. The characters are all likable and accessible. It sort of compares to Pixar's Toy Story in one key way and that is instead of actual toys being self-aware of their role in human life, its digitized characters who reside in arcade games. The film builds to a great climax at the end, but never leaves you wanting anything more during the adventure. I have only one complaint and its THE only reason I don't give it ten stars, and that is I wish it had showcased more familiar arcade-game characters. I used to play a lot of those games and it was great seeing this application of retro/vintage characters represented however it would have been cool to see references of the more popular games of that era, which sadly are not at all. I cant help but feel this was intentional as Disney has unlimited resources to license such things. The connection to familiar game/characters would have only made the film that much stronger. But that aside, Wreck-it Ralph is a slick, smart animated masterpiece on par with anything else that has ever been released.",9,0,1,28 September 2013
Behind The Candelabra," Disjointedly myopic.
","I was greatly disappointed in this HBO presentation of Liberace. I was not expecting a bio of the man, but I felt severely hamstrung by the lack of information. There seems to be a contradiction of living to entertain others yet be so self-absorbed and narcissistic while doing it. Its obvious the bulk of this is thru the eyes of Scott Thorson because to be otherwise would usher in much more theory, conjecture, and dramatization. At times, it seems to exhibit Liberace as a victim of sorts then the rest as person absorbed with selfish interest. Michael Douglas is superb at creating a complex character without complexity. As a pianist for 45 years, I can safely say his physical performance on the piano was more accurate than any I have seen in film before, albeit a less flamboyant as Liberace's hand movements were more grandiose. Matt Damon's performance was credible yet strangely despondent and vague. The real stand-out for me was Rob Lowe's representation of Dr. Jack Starz. Although a minor role his presence was commanding and creepy. The production values and directing were very solid, with an award for the make-up artists nearly a sure bet. But overall, the film felt a bit bumpy and disjointed, with little dynamic, and even less, ironically enough, entertainment value.",Null,3,10,26 May 2013
The Lion King," Why?
","Well, we know why. MONEY. Other than that, this was a waste of resources. The hand-drawn version was vastly superior, it had more soul.
This version plods along and is poorly paced. The dialogue is sub-standard.
The script is simple and slowly delivered.
This is strictly a young-child's fare.
A lot of people praised the original music score. I was NOT one of them, Elton (sorry, SIR Elton) hasn't done anything of merit since Rock of the Westies. Famous names don't impress me, great scores do, and the underscore sounds phoned in.
The lead vocals in the circle of life are horrendous.
I didn't hear much sound design or foley, they just used the VI East Meets West Hollywood Choir and Strings libraries to cover things up.
Does it look good? Of course its does. It's Disney after all, and Favreau is in full stride theses days. The CGI and art direction are immaculate, top notch.
I know the story, but 10 minutes-in, I was bored.",2,1,1,29 January 2020
Brave," This one misses by a mile.
","For Pixar, this is clearly one of their worst. OK, we already know the film is going to look and sound wonderful, and Brave is no exception. The story is the real turkey here as I kept waiting for it to develop only to sadly discover, oh, the mother turning into a bear IS the story. They attempt to espouse that one need not find adventure beyond their own realm, or was it a story to bring mother and daughter closer together, I don't know, it wasn't clear to me. Most Pixar films have been family ones, but this is a kiddie installment. It has a few moments of humor, but a lot of the films moments borrows from others. Too many scenes focus on needless minutia and unrelated activities that I found pointless, boring, and non-productive.I still don't know why the film is titled 'Brave' as my interpretation of that word differs sharply from that of the writer's.",5,2,4,26 May 2013
Up," The 1st Pixar disappointment.
","While the 1st 25 minutes was superb in every way, the rest of the movie plodded along with a ridiculous and silly story line. The very poignant messages that were introduced in the beginning get overshadowed, and rarely revisited, by a bombardment of inane scenes and unlikable characters.The kid scout was annoying and morbidly obese (and eats chocolate constantly) the idolized explorer is really a ego-centric and sadistic sort. There's next to no character development. Our lead character, well voiced by Ed Asner, although old enough to need a cane, magically runs and lassos his house for most of the film. There was no sympathy written in for the hunted big bird or the enslaved dogs. Somehow when the helium was running out and the balloon count was depleting, the house would later rise again. The story was inane. I would have preferred a more concerted effort in betraying the real messages of the film: Cherish your loved ones, live a full life, be cautious of false idols, don't be a slave to material possessions, help your fellow man, follow your dreams, live up to your promises- all the things outline in the 1st 25 minutes which all get abandoned for the rest of the film.The look was what we expect from Pixar- highly polished,detailed, vibrant and resolute but I would have liked to see more 3-D FX as there were no instances of things coming at you or from behind you, but the depth rendering was superb. Overall, I was bored and couldn't wait for it to end.",6,2,8,11 June 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Bigger Isn't Always Better
","OK- we all know the story, we all know its based on a mediocre kids cartoon, so let us let that be our guiding perspective, shall we?The 2nd installment is practically identical in formula to the 1st but amplified to the point of boredom. The jokes are more plentiful (especially from Sam's mom who steals every scene),more cute pets (Mojo humps a Boston terrier), the girls are more sexy (gratuitous rear end shots, and slow-motion chest bouncing, and even a strip scene), the explosions are well uh.. more explosive, more Autobots, more story-telling based on the Autobot's history, more chase and battle scenes, improved audio FX.Skip this paragraph to avoid spoiler. Instead of the all-spark being the threat its now a machine left here by the 'fallen' in 1700 BC. Sam, having touched the all-spark, has the location of the doomsday device embedded his brain that can only be deciphered by an historic Autobot who has been deactivated in the form of a stealth fighter in a aerospace museum. Who wants the location? You guessed it, the Deceptigons and they are ruthless in their methods of obtaining it.With all of this we get less character involvement, drawn out battles that play out way too long, and a rushed epilogue. Not a bad movie in any sense but numbing to the point of boredom due to relentless and protracted action. Some clever writing and story telling from a film of THIS genre, it carefully avoids clichés and sappiness, and posing is kept to a safe minimum, but a good 20 minute time trim would have helped enormously.",6,21,45,24 June 2009
Burlesque," One huge giant cliché
","This movie was so bad it was funny, one giant cliché after another It reminded me of PG-rated version of Showgirls-small town girl who slaves in a diner gets stiffed by her boss-so she take a bus to LA to fulfill her dreams<ul><li>works as bartender at a glitzy, non-porno Burlesque club, moves in with one of the bartender, they have a crush on each other</li></ul><ul><li>her roommate is an aspiring songwriter, who works on this little 2 octave keyboard and notates everything out</li></ul><ul><li>she gets an audition, the boss ( Cher) who is a has-been performer, gives her a break after our starlet begs and begs.</li></ul><ul><li>gratuitous gay back-stage manager</li></ul><ul><li>she catches the attention of a rich patron, who tried to corrupt her, has a huge mansion in the Hollywood Hills.</li></ul><ul><li>eventually the old star ( who's a drunk and a slut) of the show gets envious and quits.</li></ul><ul><li>the bar is in dire financial straights, the bank is circling to foreclose.</li></ul><ul><li>our new star and her roommate finally make love.</li></ul><ul><li>Cher and Christina barge into the office of a wealthy land developer ( James frigging' Brolin) and convince him to buy their club.</li></ul><ul><li>their club is saved, yay! happy ending ensues. Even the envious drunk slut returns to apologize in what can be compared to a very Brady moment.</li></ul>Of course everything is improbable, predictable, neat and pretty ( pretty lame). The dialog is plastic and one-dimensional. Obviously this was a vehicle for Aguilera to get pushed thru the Hollywood star mechanism. I swear the girl must have had bot-ox or is on Lexipro, cause even when she smiles she has no emotion- its uncanny. She always has this vacant disconnect like no matter how hard she tries to be there- strangely she isn't.Then there is Cher, who still looks pretty damn good for 65. She must have negotiated the solo performance in the contract. It really brought the film down to a screeching halt and served no purpose. At least no obvious Auto-Tune on her vocals this time.I know quite a lot about burlesque, and there is very little in this film. Burlesque is a bit more risqué and a LOT less Fosse. There is no skit work,bad jokes, or pasties and only one number where the act actually strips. Actually the film doesn't foray into any explanation of burlesque at all.Lastly, there is the music and how it ties into the film. The point of this club was the girls lip- synced to standard burlesque songs.OK, I can go along with that but then why the need for the band? Good musicians ain't cheap and in cabaret licensed club- they get union scale. Since the club was bad off financially, the band must have cost them 6K a week, and the performers are already lip-syncing so WHY KEEP A BAND?!! Of course the mixes are slick studio sounding- not live at all which is what Christina uniquely offers to the club- the ABILITY TO SING LIVE! ARGH!!Oh, and check out the remake of Marilyn Manson's 'Beautiful People' in the beginning and end credits: unforgivable.",3,4,9,8 July 2011
Whiplash," Stupid and Improbable story.
","Well acted? Sure. Decent directing and production values- yep! Plausible or realistic storyline? Not at all. There is no Shaffer Conservatory. Berklee College of Music in Boston used to be heavy on big-band jazz, but now the school has become far more vocational. None of the conservatory's I am aware of feature jazz as a curriculum, and if they did, it certainly would not be a major. No music professor in the USA would have a job if they behaved the way Fletcher does, and more to the point, no JAZZER would ever behave this way under any circumstances. Jazzers are not confrontational or competitive, that would contradict everything they stand for. The way the other musician behaved and talked in this film is not even remotely accurate AT ALL. Real musicians in REAL life, ESPECIALLY JAZZERS, are brotherly. A professor would never come into another professor's class and take over, would never physically abuse a student or yell at them this way ( with intense profanity, humiliation, and gender-insensitivity). A teacher wouldn't come in and insult the entire ensemble EVER. They would never audition them in the manner Fletcher does. They would never focus so much on the drummer, nor would they put so much emphasis on a stupid and pointless competition. The JVC Jazz festival, like any other jazz festival, does not have label-people attending to scout for new talent like baseball scouts. Labels are overrun with demo tapes and web links to downloads, and his remark that if you screw up they will remember you for the expressed purpose of denying you a deal is absolutely inane.I have NEVER seen a drummer get bloody hands just from playing fast: a stick only weighs about 2 ounces and is very smooth. Oh BTW, drummers never share sticks. Sticks are very personal, and ALL drummers, in a music program, carry a stick bag with them like a woman carries a purse. I have never seen 'alternate' drummers in an ensemble or page turners for drummer. Big-band rehearsals at 9AM? Are they joking? You'd never get that many musicians to be at class that early and behave like soldiers in bootcamp, NO WAY! Are we to believe that Andrew get tossed from school, before Fletcher, because he messed up playing a song in a competition? Seriously? Even though he was bloody from a car accident? Maybe if this imaginary tale took place in hell, it would have slightly more credibility. Hollyweird NEVER portrays musicians accurately in a feature film. This is not a powerful movie, it doesn't make a point or carry any type of profound message and it doesn't portray musicians or music-schools with an accuracy at all. Im sure its fooled a lot of lay-people.",4,31,57,20 June 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Almost perfect
","I'm sure at this point everything has been written about Nolan's 3rd installment to this trilogy. So, I am just going to add this, I had two major problems with this movie: (1) The dialog audio was periodically buried in the soundtrack. There were many times I had no idea what was being said. I have this on Bluray and had to back it up multiple times, and still some things were impossible for me to understand. Along with this was Bane's audio which was even more difficult for me to make out. I realize it fashionable to emphasize/hype-up the audio for the rock-concert effect. But there was so much bottom-end EQ-boost it made for much of his dialog unintelligible.*Spoiler-alert* (2) Four times in the last 30 minutes someone is on the brink of being killed ( or at least seriously hurt) only to be rescued. Its not always necessary to write in this kind of fractional desperation, and these actions became obvious and annoying to me. Other than these 2 items, I loved the movie and was a fitting end to Nolan's brilliant and masterful vision of this character.",9,11,17,10 December 2012
