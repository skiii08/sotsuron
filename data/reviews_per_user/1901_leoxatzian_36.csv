Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The satirical shockumentary to end all satirical shockumentaries.
","While it is as hilarious as it is offensive to most of the world's ethnic and/or religious groups, the reasons as to why are so indescribably bizarre that it makes you wonder if what you are watching is the work of a mad man or of a mad genius. The one thing you can say for sure about this movie is that, for better or worst, there is nothing else quite like it.",8,1,3,11 May 2019
Alien 3," An underachieving sequel, but an interesting movie on it's own.
","While it never manages to be as revolutionary as it's predecessors in terms of story, atmosphere or special effects, 'AlienÂ³' still manages to expand the franchise's mythology and further develop the protagonist's character, making it a disappointing but somewhat entertaining third instalment in the legendary science fiction series.",6,0,0,16 March 2019
50 First Dates," Both funny and moving at the same time.
","With both Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in leading roles giving some truly emotional and believable performances and a unique premise that proves to be both funny and heartwarming, '50 first dates' turns out to be a truly exceptional romantic comedy. What really makes this movie work so well is it's perfect balance between the comedic and emotionally heavier moments, a blend that would otherwise make a movie feel disjointed but works so well in this movie because it knows exactly when it has to be funny and when it has to be more emotional.",8,1,1,7 April 2019
The Ring," An atmospheric, mysterious and downright horrifying experience.
","A remake of the Japanese horror classic of the same name, this American version successfully manages to not only differentiate itself from the original but to also honour it's legacy. Instead of depending heavily on jump scares and gory imagery to scare the audience, 'The Ring' focus more on it's compelling plot and interesting characters and creates a phycologically haunting atmosphere that, along with the help of some creatively horrifying cinematography, makes the overall experience much more effective in scaring the viewer.",7,0,0,10 May 2019
Captain Marvel," Not marvelous, but an ok movie nonetheless.
","While it's protagonist could have been a lot more interesting and fun, she is still a good protagonist when compared to other female superheroes in female led superhero movies that aren't 'Wonder Woman'. The movie itself is a serviceable enough origin story and ends up having a rather big impact on the story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Overall, even if it is rather flawed, 'Captain Marvel' could still prove inspirational for Marvel's female demographic and serve as a promising start for Marvel to do better in future movies.",6,4,7,20 March 2019
Shakespeare in Love," The most Oscar worthy chick flick ever made.
","The idea that Shakespeare's most iconic theatrical plays were inspired by his own personal life stories is a really interesting concept, that the movie takes full advantage of and makes something extraordinary with by combining it with brilliant cinematography and a talented cast, whose performances are amazing even by William Shakespeare's standards.",8,0,0,12 January 2019
Alien: Resurrection," An unnecessary but interesting continuation.
","Even if it really feels like a forced sequel that was made just to keep the franchise going after it was given an underwhelming but proper ending with it's third installment, 'Alien : resurrection' still manages to give us a lot of what we have grown to love about these movies while also mixing it up with it's own new ideas. Admittedly, some of these ideas don't always work to the movie's advantage, but those that do, not only make the movie worth watching but also make it an important one for the franchise going forward.",6,0,0,18 April 2019
The Mummy," Timeless fun.
","It might not be remembered as a classic Universal monster movie, but it's simple plot and entertaining characters make it a fun watch for everyone to enjoy. In fewer words, 'The Mummy' is a great mix of action, comedy and fantasy, making it a must watch for all mummy fans.",7,1,2,6 November 2018
Aquaman," An aquatic adventure unlike any other.
","When one of the most badass men in Hollywood is cast to play one of the silliest characters to ever come out of a comic book, you get a new version of Aquaman that has a literal ocean of potential. The plot might be pretty standard and the pacing way too fast for it's own good, but the characters are interesting enough to stand out on their own, the action is exhilarating and the CGI effects are so eye-popping and colourful that no other DC movie resembles them.",7,2,3,23 December 2018
Snatch," An example of crime comedies at their very best.
","It might be a little too fast pasted and hard to follow for some viewers, but it is guaranteed to get you invested in it's story and characters if you pay enough attention to it. With Guy Richie's signature style of writing and directing on full display, brilliant editing and a cast full of talented actors giving everything into their roles, 'Snatch' turns out to be a cleverly thought out story that deserves to be seen.",8,1,2,13 March 2019
Scary Movie 2," Even more outrageous than the original, but not as funny.
","Even if the original 'Scary movie' was a bit too obvious and over the top with it's humor - which was primarily making references to other movies and mixing what was popular with what's totally disgusting - it managed to get a fair amount of solid laughs nonetheless. 'Scary movie 2' however believes that in order to top it's predecessor, it's humor has to be even more obvious and even more disgusting while also satirizing as many movies as possible at the same time, resulting in a parody who's jokes range from amusing to painfully unfunny.",4,1,4,15 April 2019
Alien," A horror classic for the ages.
","The movie might have a really slow pace and very few scares for a modern audience to enjoy, but it's likable characters and intense atmosphere make it a timeless original movie that deserves to be watched. Much like a lot of classic horror movies of it's time, what really makes it scary is not what you see on screen, but rather what the characters and the situations they are in make you fell.",8,1,2,12 December 2018
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A dark, twisted and bloody brilliant musical thriller.
","Director Tim Burton combines his uniquely gothic style of film-making with Johnny Depp's undeniable acting talent once again to bring us this musical tale of lethal revenge. With a talented cast, a visionary director, visually pleasing cinematography and toe taping musical numbers that never feel unnecessary or out of place, 'Sweeney Todd' is one of the few movie's of it's kind that has something for everyone.",8,0,1,4 March 2019
The Shining," A masterpiece of modern horror indeed.
","While it is a far cry from Steven King's original novel, there is no denying that Stanley Kubrick's movie adaptation of 'The Shining' is nothing short of a masterpiece in its own right. Stanley Kubrick's masterful directing, the brilliant performances given by the cast and eerie cinematography that is guaranteed to send chills down you spine create a haunting atmosphere that will have you watching the whole movie through your fingers.",8,0,5,29 April 2019
Face_Off," A face off in every sense of the word.
","The movie's main idea might be nothing short of impossible science, but everything else going on is so over the top and so interesting that it makes the audience more than willing to look past that and just enjoy the ride. With Nicolas Cage and John Travolta in leading roles giving everything they've got, 'Face off' manages to deliver an action packed thrill ride that also has some more emotional and character building moments to balance everything out.",7,0,1,2 February 2019
Aliens," Bigger and better in every way.
","With some of the best thing from the original movie and some of it's more lackluster details being further improved upon, 'Aliens' manages to be everything a sequel should be, all by combining everything that was great about it's predecessor with new and creative ideas in order to further develop the franchise's characters and mythology. The movie's pacing is still incredibly slow, but the payoff is still action packed and more that worth the wait.",8,1,3,31 January 2019
Tropic Thunder," Excitement, action, comedy and more excitement.
","'Tropic Thunder' is an action comedy that has both an all-star cast and an interesting premise and most importantly of all, it knows how to use them. When the comedic and acting talents of Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black and Tom Cruise are brought together by a plot that provides a ton of opportunities for action packed and comedic moments, there is nothing else to do but to get excited for what you're about to see.",7,1,3,24 March 2019
Liar Liar," An all-around great movie.
","The story of the loving but overworking father whose family always ends up taking a back seat to his work might be done to death, but 'Liar Liar' succeeds in making a great movie out of this overdone concept with the help of the always hilarious comedic talents of Jim Carrey and an original plot that doesn't just teach viewers the importance of family like every other movie of it's kind, but also shows us a realistic portrayal of the consequences of lying.",7,0,0,2 May 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," An underachieving but worthy continuation.
","As far as sequels of revolutionary masterpieces like the original 'Jurassic Park' go, 'The lost world' might not be an improvement upon it's predecessor, but it is unique and inventive enough to be worthy of it's legacy. The movie uses a ton of breathtaking visual and practical effect and puts a stronger emphasis on action, while also managing to recapture some of the heartwarming charm that made the original such a timeless classic.",6,4,9,15 February 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Nothing but the best from Quentin Tarantino once again.
","With a cast of insanely talented actors giving excellent performances, a deep understanding and love for the time period and Quentin Tarantino's signature style of writing and directing covering every single frame, 'Once upon a time in Hollywood' is both a love letter to the golden age of cinema and an all around fantastic movie. Unsurprisingly, Quentin Tarantino's style of filmmaking will confuse those unfamiliar with his tropes, but for those who remain patient and invested in the story for long enough, the payoff is huge.",8,5,7,31 August 2019
Aladdin," Severely lacking the original's magic.
","The amazing costume design, colorful sets and unbelievable dance choreography make this movie truly gorgeous to look at. Also, the songs and musical numbers are enchanting to listen to and the enthusiasm that the cast brings out while performing them is infectious. Sadly, everything else in
it works to it's detriment, including some of the characters feeling horribly miscast, changes to the plot, barely explained character motivations and CGI effects that are rather hit or miss. In conclusion, while this new version of the timeless classic has a lot going for it, it also has a lot of serious problems that simply can't go unnoticed.",6,1,3,2 June 2019
The Lion King," Way too similar to the original for it's own good.
","While 'The Lion King' might be a better put together movie than most live action Disney remakes, it also doesn't take nearly as many chances as some others did. The CG-animation is undeniably gorgeous but it's realistic style doesn't capture the original's expressiveness, the musical numbers are either kept exactly the same or changed for the worst and while the voice cast is really talented and charming, they don't really bring anything new to the table. In conclusion, while it is a pretty good movie in its own right, it is just so insultingly similar to the original that it barely feels like a remake at all.",5,0,0,26 July 2019
Ghostbusters," A timeless classic with great humour, lots of charm and ghosts.
","Combining the worldwide appeal of ghost and supernatural phenomena with a charming cast of characters and comedy that appeals to both children and adults, 'Ghostbusters' manages to create something timelless and unique by combining clever humour and it's own unique charm with really good visual effects and one of the catchiest theme songs in the history of cinema.",8,2,3,6 February 2019
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," What you see is what you get and that's pretty much it.
","While quality and substance is never to be expected from a 'Resident Evil' movie, that doesn't mean that all of it's problems should be glanced over. To be fair, Milla Jovovich is entertaining in the leading role, some action sequences are pretty cool and the practical effects can be somewhat impressive. At the same time however, the narrative suffers from an almost complete lack of focus, the CGI could use some work and the editing is so atrociously quick that it makes the majority of the scenes either really hard to follow or downright seizure inducing, making for a mostly unpleasant viewing experience.",3,0,3,20 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," All style, very little substance.
","This movie had the potential, the runtime and the budget to be the greatest modern 'Star Wars' movie and expand upon the mythology and new characters that were introduced in the last one. But this movie sadly makes marketing itself to children and throwing stupid comedy at the audience it's top priority, which means that plot, character development, consistency and logical sence always come dead last.",3,13,17,13 November 2018
The Evil Dead," Phenomenal practical effects and make up, but no story to back it up.
","While 'The evil dead' pacts a ton of realistically mind blowing make up effects and has more than enough bloodshed to please zombie and demon enthusiasts, it has nothing to offer in terms of plot, character development or any kind of story structure in order to make the gore worth the attention it is getting, resulting in a mindless movie that is the definition of style over substance.",4,2,9,7 March 2019
Jurassic World," Yet another flawed but entertaining waste of time.
","As much as the movie wants to be the next Jurassic park, it just ends up being the next 'Jurassic park 3', in the sense that it is just another fun and idiotic dinosaur movie that just happens to be a sequel to one of Steven Spielberg's masterpieces. The movie has a ton of plot holes illogical moments, very few interesting characters and CGI effects that are full of imagination, but are lacking the realism of the original. In conclusion, this new installment in the blockbuster franchise might not be a mind-blowing piece of work, but it has enough mindlessly entertaining moments to keep it fun.",5,2,3,29 January 2019
Zombieland," A master class on how to break the mold.
","While there are a lot of undeniably high quality zombie movies and shows out there offering both a gripping story and great characters, most of them also tend to have an overly serious tone that sacrifices having fun for more emotional storytelling. 'Zombieland' however manages to add a more humourous tone into the mix without taking the focus off its characters. A great sense of humor, some really likable characters, fun action and a few touching moments here and there make for a zombie movie that hits all the right notes and manages to stand out in an oversaturated market.",8,1,1,30 July 2019
Scream 2," A slasher sequel finally done right.
","If you thought that slasher movie sequels could be nothing more than an inferior continuation to the original and provide nothing new or innovative, 'Scream 2' is here to prove you wrong. The entertaining characters, suspenseful directing and unique kind of meta humor that you loved from the original are back and combined with an exciting new plot, proving that even slasher movie sequels can be great as long as there's enough care and passion put into them.",7,6,7,11 April 2019
Jaws," The grandaddy of all summer blockbusters.
","When you combine the directorial talent of Steven Spielberg, an instantly recognizable and terrifying musical score by John Williams, a talented cast of actors and a blood hungry killer shark, you get one of the most iconic and most influential movies ever made. Despite the fact that it centers around a killer shark, 'Jaws' manages to be much more than just a mindless shark movie due to it's realistic human characters and brilliant cinematography.",8,0,1,2 March 2019
Hancock," A huge missed opportunity.
","The initial premise had a lot of potential
for success and with the lovable and charismatic Will Smith in the leading role, it could have led to a truly unique and memorable superhero movie. Unfortunately, while the movie does initially seem to know what it's doing and even offers some solid laughs, it takes a nosedive in quality and completely shifts it's gears in a matter of seconds around the half way point. As a result, what could have been a much simpler but way more impactful story about a reckless hero trying to be a better person for both himself and others, turns into a needlessly convoluted mess that ultimately amounts to nothing.",4,0,2,17 November 2019
Scream," The movie that truly revolutionized the slasher genre.
","While at first it might look like another one of the many mindless bloodbaths dominating the slasher genre, giving it a watch will quickly reveal that this horror flick by director Wes Craven is far from being your typical uninspired slasher movie. No matter what your opinion is about slasher movies, there is no denying that 'Scream' successfully manages to captivate it's audience with it's suspenseful directing, entertaining characters, interesting ideas, cleverly written plot and self aware sense of humour.",7,3,3,5 April 2019
Speed," An action packed adrenaline rush.
","With exciting and fast paced action sequences from beginning to end, characters that are charismatic and fun to watch and a simple but grabbing plot that manages to make itself all the more interesting as it goes on by upping the ante with even crazier stunts and even bigger explosions, 'Speed' delivers a two hour long thrill ride that will keep
you at the edge of your seat.",7,0,0,3 February 2019
300," An epic masterpiece.
","Combining greek mythology and real spartan culture with a hint of fantasy, brilliant performances and too many stunning shots and visuals to count, '300' is guaranteed to make you end up with you mouth wide open in disbelief.",8,0,0,6 November 2018
Incredibles 2," It was more than worth the wait.
","This sequel to the beloved pixar superhero movie might not be as good as it's predecessor but it is just as good as it needs to be to make up for the fact that we had to wait for this sequel to be made for more than 14 years. The plot is not very different from the first one, the old favorite characters are as good as ever, the new characters are just as lovable and the action never gets boring.",8,1,4,29 November 2018
Jurassic Park," A timelless tale of prehistoric proportions.
","When one of the most brilliant directors in history is given a great story, a talented cast and revolutionary effects to work with, the final result should be nothing short of mind-blowing and timeless. In the case of 'Jurassic park' however, everything turned out so much better than they had any right to be, to the point where compliments like these don't do this masterpiece justice.",8,0,0,26 January 2019
