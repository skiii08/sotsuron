Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Rarity
","Borat is a rarity. A character so repulsive and completely lacking in sense, you can't avoid laughing at his foibles. From the improvisational mastermind Sacha Baron Cohen (Da Ali G Show, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby), comes his most controversial character, Borat Sagdiyev, the clueless anti-Semite from Kazakhstan. If you have been fortunate enough to catch 'Da Ali G Show', you're probably already familiar with his antics. As it is with Cohen's other characters, Borat goes across America, shocking unsuspecting Americans with his socially, as well as politically, incorrect behavior. One graphic example is showing strangers pornographic pictures of his wife and sister. Being on HBO, Borat has had the freedom to be all he was meant to be and his barely R-rated film is no exception. In what is basically, several Borat segments combined into one 90 minute mocumentary, we see Cohen as his mustachioed alter-ego raising havoc on a road trip across the 'U S and A'. What was the purpose of this voyage you ask? Why to locate and marry Pamela Anderson of course and if there's time, shoot a documentary on American culture. And American culture he finds while discovering feminists, embarrassing rodeos, and finding Jesus along the way. If this movie does anything, it proves that Cohen will do anything, no matter how disturbing or illegal. I'm not sure, but if a few of these scenes weren't staged, he should have been arrested several times for some of his comical mischief. I'd give examples, but it might not be as shocking so I'll leave it up to you to find out. So among all this chaos and slandering of an already angered Kazakhstani Government, is there a film worth paying for? No contest. Borat has a tremendous chance of being the funniest film of the year. It's clever, outrageous and most notably unapologetic. Of course, I enjoyed the film myself, but I've never seen an audience laugh and applaud on so frequently. I doubt Cohen will receive any Oscar buzz, but it isn't a stretch to say that his performance is some of the best comedic acting in a long time. But don't think I'm soft, this being my first review and all, but I had a very difficult time trying to find a reason it suffered. Borat also manages to do something that many films before it have failed to do; be insightful as well as funny. Though mostly absurd, Borat sheds a floodlight on how people from other nations can be viewed in America. Despite a few exceptions, it was almost refreshing to see some Americans be so tolerant of a supposed foreigner who was intentionally meaning to anger them. I predict this movie will do well. This based on the ticket sales of R-rated comedies and the massive cult following Cohen already possesses. When I said barely R-rated at the top of the review, I didn't mean almost a PG-13. Borat is extremely graphic, profane and obviously went through many cuts before avoiding a NC-17. If you are over 17 (or have a fake ID that says you are) and don't offend easily, you won't be disappointed.",Null,13,35,3 November 2006
