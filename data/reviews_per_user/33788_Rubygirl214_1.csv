Requiem for a Dream," Brilliant!!
","One of the most harrowing, brilliant films of all times. Never before has a film left me so gutted emotionally.  Every part is acted to perfection, every nuance of the film perfectly executed from the photography to the intense soundtrack.I think this film  really explores the fact that some doctors are just as evil, if not worse than the drug dealers themselves. The downward spiral of every character was felt to the core, with no 'Hollywood' ending, and no apologies for portraying such brutal reality.This movie was so disturbing, I had to watch a comedy afterward, and still couldn't erase it from my head. Everyone I've loaned this movie to has agreed on it's brilliance.My favorite scene in the movie is when Ellen Burstyn is hallucinating, and dancing around the living room with a face full of smeared, grotesque,clown-like makeup in her coveted red dress. It just floored me with the desperation and immense loneliness of that character.Highly, highly recommended!!",Null,0,0,3 February 2003
