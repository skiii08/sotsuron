Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I have to admit that I had my doubts, But this movie totally blew me away!
","I was afraid that Star Wars: Episode 1 would look too modern compared to the old movies, but I was very impressed with how Episode 1 tied in with the old movies. George Lucas is a genius. Everything about the movie was amazing.  The music was great. I especially liked Duel Of The Fates. It was somthing new and absolutly spectacular! The fight scene kept me on the edge of my seat.  I can't wait for Episode 2.",Null,0,0,22 June 1999
