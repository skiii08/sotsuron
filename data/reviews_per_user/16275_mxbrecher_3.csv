Hereditary," The perfect balance between family drama and pure horror that's unbearable!
","Hereditary is a film that comes rare. Unlike most horror films this one never used jump scares or cheap effects, this had imagery and sound like never before! The acting is absolutely flawless, especially Toni Collette. Toni has never performed so perfectly! She deserves a lot of recognition for her terrifying role as a grieving mother. Hereditary is a really sophisticated film that feels so real you forget you're watching a movie. The film is centers around the Graham family after a loss of their grandmother and dealing with family relationships that obviously are very off and uncomfortable. Annie basically is broken, but she breaks so unbelievably horrifying you'll never forget it. Her son peter is suffering just as bad after the horrid accident involving the death of his sister Charlie. Things couldn't get worse right? Well they get so much worse the Graham family starts experiencing terrifying occurrences throughout the grieving of both losses and trying to keep them together. Steve, Annie's husband is just not believing any of this involving his wife's friend Joan from the grief counseling sessions she secretly went to earlier on. After all this Steve thinks Annie cracked but really all these premonitions are real and actually happeneing because of the grandmothers connection to a cult falling to the hands of King Paimon. If you enjoy films like the witch, or rosemarys baby you'll LOVE this! It's my favorite film of all time, and of all horror! It's beautiful, disturbing as can be, depressing, unsettling, terrifying in so many ways.",10,1,3,25 January 2019
Us," Even Lupita's stunning performance couldn't save the film...
","I was most excited to see this...but in the end us really didn't do anything for me at all. All the performances were perfect, plot and story. I hail get out as one of the best films ever and groundbreaking. Thought US would be the same, except the execution wasn't what I was told from critics and audiences. This movie isn't a horror film at all, I never felt so empty from a film. Too many references and political and racial all put in one and never explained fully, as well as characters and instances that were so pointless. I hate this film worst excuse for a horror film, I consider it a comedy I laughed too much because it was so unconvincing and stupid. I understand praising the performances not the film in all. Loved Half and hated half equal likes and dislikes to this film, I praise acting but message was sloppy.",2,2,2,28 May 2019
Midsommar," Traumatized! My jaw was to the floor! Pure brilliance, amazing job Ari again!
","Wow! Ok where do I start! Going into MidSommar I only knew it had to do with a rocky relationship between Chris and Dani and that they went to a Swedish festival to let loose! Meanwhile Dani is suffering from an immense amount of grief after losing her family suddenly. Dani drags along for the trip, once they all get there it's just very weird from the start. Sooner or later after they take this potion to make you trip and visualize horrific events. The Swedish festival ran by the villagers have a ceremony and commit a disturbing sacrifice of two volunteers. After seeing that Dani wants out to go home, shortly after everything starts getting extremely sadistic psychologically for the visiting friends from America. Everyone has visuals but mostly Chris and Dani are most messed up. The last act is cruel, vial and traumatic! I can't say too much or I'll spoil it! MidSommar is 2019 most disturbing, stunning and captivating experience I've ever seen, but it really really messed me up big time!",10,23,44,3 July 2019
