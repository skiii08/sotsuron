Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Controversial, weird, funny, and just plain strange!
","Sacha Baron Cohen's 'Ali G' character isn't all that funny. To be honest, 'Da Ali G Show' really isn't all that funny. However, the character of Borat could be the only bit on the show and carry it just fine! This film is an hour and a half of Jew-bashing, male full frontal nudity (except Cohen, himself, is the only male that blurs his crotch), and chasing the woman every male at one point in their lives hoped of chasing - Pam Anderson! A very funny movie for the most part - with witty, off-colored jokes, and controversy lurking with every cut of the camera. I heard through the grape-vine that the only bit in the film NOT unscripted was the Pam Anderson scene when he finally reaches her at an autograph signing. She apparently knew about the whole thing - but it honestly doesn't show!",7,2,6,20 November 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," 'Sweeny' was waiting to be 'Burton-ized!'
","Let me first begin by saying - like a lot of people who went into this movie - i didn't know a whole lot about the stage version of 'Sweeny.' I knew it was dark and a movie about a killer...but that was the extent of my knowledge. I was more than pleasantly surprised! Johnny Depp has a haunting voice and he makes Todd his own...as he does with every character he portrays. At first, I will admit, I felt like Jack Sparrow was cast as Todd...however that was all lost when I got sucked into the passion and terror that Burton and Depp brought to this film. Of course I couldn't forget the amazing performance from the soon-to-be Mrs. Burton - Ms. Helena Bohnam Carter. She was creepy, yet beautiful as Mrs. Lovett and did the role perfect justice! The whole ensemble complete with Baron Cohen and Rickman along with the very talented cast of youngsters completed this masterpiece of stage-to-cinema. Burton has done it again...and proves once again...that he is among the elite Hollywood directors of the last twenty years. Now that Scorsese has his Oscar...maybe it's time for the Academy to give Mr. Burton his dues.",9,1,2,28 December 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Farrell steps out of realm beautifully!
","It's NOT a Will Farrell movie, people! Yes he stars in it. Yes he does make a couple of 'Farrelesk' jokes. But this film is NOT an 'Anchorman' or 'Talladega Nights' by any stretch. Funny-man Farrell actually cries in this film - and makes you want to cry right along with him! He's following in the footsteps of comedy-legends Jim Carrey, Bill Murray, and Robin Williams just fine with his dramatic turn in this film. Farrell proves that he can carry the leading-man load without his fellow 'Frat Pack' mates (Stiller, the Wilson brothers, Vaughn, and Carrell) to back him up. As a matter of fact, NONE of them make cameos in this movie! But aside from Will's admirable performance, the story is something anyone who has ever dipped into the art of story-telling can relate to. Just how do you kill Harold Krick? How do you make the ending something no one suspects? How do you keep a reader guessing until the very end?",8,0,1,20 November 2006
