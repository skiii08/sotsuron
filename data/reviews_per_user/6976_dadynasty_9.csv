The Devil's Advocate," Catchy name, thats about it
","Keanu Reeves underacts, Al Pacino overacts. Each's performances are one of the worst of their careers. That is especially saying something about Reeves. Charlize Theron plays the girlfriend, a role she reprises in almost every movie she is in. Bland directing and writing lend no assistance to the movie. It barely recieves 4 out of 10.",4,5,14,8 March 2003
The Ring," stylish and scary
","The Ring is a movie that holds your attention from its start due to its tremedous editing, direction, and story. The music by Hans Zimmer is also terrific. Naomi Watts is very good as the catalyst in the story. Brian Cox delivers his usual fine performance. The rest of the cast is good, but not great. The direction of Gore Verbinski is outstanding. His directing builds the suspense to a head, without giving much away. The art direction and sets are very well done and set the mood for the whole story. The Ring is one the best horror movies I've ever seen. The screenplay lacks in some areas and excels in others. I give it a 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,20 April 2003
The Godfather: Part II," The American Movie
","The Godfather movies define America. What makes the second part of the Godfather movies the greatest of the series, and ultimately the greatest movie of all time is the way it contrast and compares the America of the present (the 70's) with the America of of then. It shows the family rising to power under the dominance of Vito Corleone, while also showing the family's power and control crumbling as Michael struggles to live up to the legacy that was his father. While watching the movie, you can't help but be swept up by the history. Just the ambience of the movie is enough to make it great. Then you add in the tremedous cast, firm directing, and moving script, and you have the movie that surpasses all others to become the greatest of all time.",Null,0,1,8 March 2003
Men in Black II," How is it so much worse than the original?
","I never hated sequels as much as other people. While they do have a tendency to be much worse than the originals, it doesn't mean there isn't a use for them. Some can be quite enjoyable. This movie is not one of those examples. The gags are either holdovers from the original or are so ill-concieved that they are almost painful to watch. The opening sequence starts promising, with the purposefully shoddy remake of the landing of the princess. Sadly, the movie recedes from that start to the viewer being relieved it has ended. And as much as hate the acting of Linda Fiorentino, I enjoyed her character much more than Rosario Dawson's. Also Vincent D'Onofrio's Bug was pure comic genius in his physicality. Lara Flynn Boyle's villian is entirely lifeless. Will and Tommy just walk through their characterizations, where in the original they had fun defining their characters and presenting them for the viewer. I honestly hope Sonnefeld is done with this series. Then again a third movie couldn't be as bad.",3,0,0,8 March 2003
Mystic River," Good, but not great
","Mystic River is an example of a potentially great movie that when realized, was merely very good. Mystic River's biggest flaw is the way previously unimportant characters are thrust into the spotlight and character traits before previously explored are given full attention. What I am about to say may be a spoiler of sorts if the reader has not already seen the movie, so avert your eyes quickly (like now)so as to not be deprived of full enjoyement of the aforementioned movie. Okay, so as I was saying, I think Eastwood and Brian Helgeland probably wanted to give those watching the movie the sense that an invisible, but omnipresent, wall had developed between Sean(Bacon) and Jimmy(Penn), and David(Robbins). When David was taken away at the beginning of the movie, his life and the lives of the other two boys, began to take on two very different paths. I believe the filmakers were trying to show that division still existed even to the point of Sean protecting Jimmy even after he took David's life without reason. As Jimmy's wife(Laura Linney) put it, Sean and Jimmy were 'kings' of their world, able to protect what is theirs at all costs. David, due to his unfortunate encounter as a child, was devoid of the power that Sean and Jimmy assumed. The closing seen seemed to enhance this feeling, as Sean's and Jimmy's families are seen together, whole and joyous. David's, on-the-other-hand, is left fatherless and lost. Unfortunately, this theme is barely hinted at until the closing scenes. My guess is the novel is more focused when it comes to this theme, because it seems to be the driving force behind the entire story. The movie forsakes that theme until the end, in order to tell a murder mystery.   Therefore, the movie is a very good murder mystery, with a few excellent dramatic moments. The acting, of course, is paramount. Any movie that names Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishbure, and Laura Linney is sure to include top-notch acting. Penn will probally win the Best Actor award, and justly so. I haven't seen better acting by a male lead in the year past. Bacon or Robbins could have recieved nominations. Robbins character is more pronounced, therefore got the nod. Yet, Bacon's sympathetic, yet powerful acting is great in its subtlety. Marica Gay Harden's portrayal is heart-breaking as an unwitting bystander in the drama between the three men, and Tom Guiry delivers a breakout performance as the boyfriend. Clint Eastwood is overrated as a director. His direction is merely what every novice director would do. The flashbacks, pans towards the sky, and over-head shots are stat-quo for the scenes in which they are used.     The great acting brings this movie to life. Without it, it would be average. With it, I would give it a 7 out of 10. Unfortunately, I haven't seen the other Oscar nominated movie's this year, so this is the best movie I have seen this year. I hope this is not the case.",Null,0,0,23 February 2004
Jaws," 'It's only an island if you look at it from the water'
","Jaws is the most enjoyable to watch, ever. It sublimely entertwines comedy and action into a perfect mixture that has the viewer glued to film. Everything about the movie is excellent. The job done casting this movie was perfect and very interesting since none of the actors were huge stars at the time. Roy Scheider is perfect as the anal police chief, facial expressions and all. Richard Dreyfuss does his usual character, and is the most enjoyable to watch. Robert Shaw, however, delivers the best performance, and should have recieved a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The writing is superb, as well as maybe John Williams finest score. Steven Spielberg became Hollywood's 'boy genius' with this film, and for good reason. He sets every mood with his direction and allows the suspense to build naturally. His pacing his excellent. I believe it is his third best film, behind E.T. and Schindler's List. It makes my top 20 films of all time. 10 out of 10.",10,2,4,15 April 2003
Raging Bull," Scorcese's masterpiece
","Any movie list that places Raging Bull as the 50th best film of all time with both Lord of the Ring movies ahead of it is absolutely ludacris. While the Lord of the Ring movies may be very good films, they do not even come close to touching the grace, violence, or emotion that Robert De Niro and Martin Scorcese bring to the screen in Raging Bull. The boxing scenes are some of the finest film work ever done. Robert De Niro delivers the best performance of his career so far, and in doing so, gives the greatest acting performance I've ever seen. De Niro is unbelieveably raw and emotional. His portrayal of LaMotta fills the screen. Cathy Moriarty is very good in her role as is Joe Pesci. Scorcese has yet to top this movie and perhaps never will. 10 out of 10 and is #5 on my all time list.",10,1,2,13 March 2003
The Birds," unnerving images, bad acting
","Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is undoubtedly one of the low points in his career. I am not sure why he chose to make this move. It has a weak plot that was doomed to fail. Of course Hitchcock was still able to deliver some eerie scenes of the birds. Also he was able to give the setting of the small town its own life, just as he did in Psycho and Rear Window. In those movies, as in the Birds, he allows the setting to become its own character. Other than those two positives, the movie was lacking quite a bit in other areas. Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor were perhaps Hitchcock's worst lead pair. Most scenes were over-acted. Also the direction was not up to par with Hitchcock's other movies. I give it a solid 5 out 10.",5,2,5,12 November 2003
The Godfather," Changed movies forever
","The original Godfather changed movies forever. The major studios became less important due to its indie makers. I cannot say anything about this film that has not already been said. It is a masterpiece with only its second part and Citizen Kane able to compare to it. The acting, writing, and directing are some of the finest ever to be recorded. Al Pacino peaked in this film with his subtle, yet absolutely effective, portrayal of Michael. Marlon Brando delivers one of Hollywood's finest performances, with the raspy voice and arched eyebrows. James Caan also found his perfect character in the emotional Sonny. Francis Ford Coppola does the finest piece of directing I've ever seen, and Puzo and Coppola's writing presents the audience with memorable characters. Sterling Hayden also steals a scene or two as the police captain. A film that defies time and repeated viewings.",10,0,2,13 March 2003
