The Avengers," Waste of my money and unfortunately time
","This movie might have been worth my time if the director had spent a sliver of his time focusing on something beside obvious comedic quips. A blind person could have seen every part of this movie from 200 miles away, oh wait never mind we have the awesome character hawk eye to do that for us 'whips out his bow and looks like a little child compared to Iron man and Thor and the Hulk(At this time Im laughing and wondering why he was ever written as a character as well as what is this random red headed woman doing in here either?)'. Perhaps I am being harsh, not a lot of the blame is on the director himself, its just 6 utterly awful annoying type A characters that all need the camera time of a full movie to be cool coming together in one movie tired together annoyingly by an awful Samuel Jackson character and with such little background explaining so many twists in the plot, look now I'm running around in my sentences I literally am lost in trying to combine all the horrendous things about this movie into one review. Perhaps if I wrote more reviews I'd be better at this. Anyways thank god for the saving grace of over accomplishing graphics allowing me to see how sweet the hulk can really be otherwise I would've given this a one. Oh just while its on my mind, Jessica Alba plays a better supporting female chick than Scarlett Johansen. I would write more about the utter expletive of this movie, but in order to do that I'd have to watch it again to remind me of all the little expletive I despised, and frankly i don't wanna waste my money doing that. Besides I am tired from staying up for this midnight showing anyways..... So disappointed this movie couldn't be as sweet as the spider man preview I saw 5 minutes before it.",1,10,34,4 May 2012
