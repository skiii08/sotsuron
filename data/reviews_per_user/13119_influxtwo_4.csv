It," Finally get to see a lot of what has only ever been implied an it's worth it
","Easily one of the more decent & developed horror films to come out of recent times.At most, a fresh and faithful adaptation of the source material. Not so much being 'just' a remake either, as the 1990 miniseries left a lot out of the book. The novel featured many themes and visuals that were deemed too complex or graphic for television audiences at the time of the early 90s. Since technology has come a long way since then they were able to depict now some of the more creative and outrageous visuals required to bring the story from the book to life. A solid 'R' rating promises more mature content also along the way.At first I was skeptical but Bill Skarsgård shot it out of the park playing the iconic character of Pennywise. His mannerisms echo Tim Curry at times, but also expand things much further. This guy was really owning the role and the special effects aided in his portrayal. Finally we are able to see a lot of what until now has only ever been implied - and there lies the real treat of the film from a horror perspective.Tim Curry's portrayal in the mini-series was also great, totally iconic and classic. However I think Bill Skarsgård was a respectable update to coincide with it. Finally a remake that doesn't feel like just a cheap cash grab but one that truly respects the source material of the novel.The child actors all do for the most part a fantastic job. Their reactions at times were appropriately hysterical, while other times they get over a rather traumatizing experience a bit too quick. Not a terrible fault to the production but still a mildly noticeable one. The rest of the supporting cast was very good as well though.Stephen King gave the film his blessing upon an early screening, and I think I'd have to agree with him. Not in a long time have I seen a horror film be this developed and emotionally captivating. I was skeptical during the first half of the film, but the whole second act was like buckling in for a roller coaster ride. I was clutching at my chest during some of the more suspenseful scenes. Would I say it was overly frightening? No not really. But I would say that they get you invested enough in to the characters to be able to feel the frights along with them. The suspense was entertaining and the film's dream-like quality meant anything could happen.With out any spoiler there was one interaction featured towards the end that really showcased just how incredibly creative and breathtaking the visuals of this film really are. Again, we are able to see a lot of what has only ever been implied. and it's worth it.A theater experience that I think takes creative visceral horror to the next level. I am really looking forward to the second chapter to see what they do with it next.9/10",9,4,11,9 September 2017

","If you go in to this expecting it to make sense like some spoon-fed equation of plot then you're setting yourself up for disappointment. But if you want to have fun riding on a fresh genre-bending thriller with some wacky twists and unashamed quirk then you may find it to surprise you. I went in as blind as possible, with low expectations to simply be entertained and it delivered for that to me. First of all the cast is EXCELLENT. Fresh terror on their faces. Beautiful acting. By every single one of them. Even the younger cast was impressive with some thrilling scenes. And next that music score. Dense, fresh, fun, chilling. Wacky. The cinematography and pacing/unfolding of events was edge of your seat anticipation. I forgot I was watching a movie, it did what it was supposed to. The experience was more than sub-par for me. Because I was willing to just go in and have fun. I enjoyed Get Out, Peele's previous film. Now, for the bad. Okay I admit some of the plot was full of holes and some pseudo stuff. Some of it was over the top silly and far-fetched. But I do not expect to go in to a Jordan Peele film and not get that wacky unreality feeling. I have come to understand his style with it's low-key fantasy and scifi motifs and elements that are never fully explained. This was a small part of Get Out's spectacle also. and this film remains to be that same style Peele has developed. It is a fresh hybrid. Respect. Is it perfect? Of course not. Was his artistic vision realized and did it entertain me? Absolutely.",9,15,31,23 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," ashes of the past

Evil Dead," The good outweighs the bad in a rare case.
","Revisiting this in 2020 was pretty interesting and satisfying. I needed that much time to let my thoughts on this film marinate. First let me cut to the chase the main cast, you could tell they put all their effort and trust in to this crew. The dedication from most of the cast and the make ups and gross-out initial story progressions were part of the extreme highlights.I think it's cool that they filmed majority of the film in order, in order to benefit from the cast's understanding of the escalation in the story. All of the pieces were there to fit in the spots. Jane Levy was committed, exhausted, and beautiful. Jessica Lucas was her usual excellent and persuasive self, I love her subtlety and realism, and always thought she was an underutilized actress. The other main actors all looked and acted their parts well both alive and especially dead. The practical make ups and unique body horror/ contagion / almost sci fi parasitical nature of the plot's re-tweaking all worked surprisingly well for a one-off.But that brings me to the weaker aspects. The story doesn't make much sense, and it's glaringly obvious especially towards the end. Even for Evil Dead standards. They couldn't really tell what vibe they wanted to go for in some parts. Gore was the top priority, and although that plays out well, especially with the deadite's, the sense of it wears thin by the end. Some of it works awesome, some of it seems a little lazy and contrived. It's a mixed bag.The writing and script suffered the most I think, and a lot more than is fair for the actors and their dedication to the roles. Had the writing and script been stronger, the good visuals could've benefitted a lot more from it. The end was a scattered wtf moment. But the initial production was not bad.I see this as an enjoyable horror film for the most part but the flaws are very evident. Some of it could've even just been fixed in editing, how they didn't notice or retweak some of the flaws in post-production is a bit of a mystery after all that work and effort of the cast.I really think Bruce Campbell should've been the truck driver at the end. If they were going to turn on the campy faucets to that degree, might as well take it all the way home with more than an after credits one-liner. Overall not the worst it could've been. The potential and glimpses of talent still shine through. But some of the contrivances, nonsense, rushed editing, and unintentional campiness was a little all over the place I can admit.I think most of the cast did great and I still think with that said, I like this film more each time I watch it. The good outweighs the bad in a rare case. It took me a while to accept this film as a part of the main series. But I think I've finally wrapped my head around it as a sequel more than a remake.",7,0,0,2 May 2020
