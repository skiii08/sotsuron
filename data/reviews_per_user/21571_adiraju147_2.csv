The Avengers," The most awaited film of the summer. Delivers.
","This, by far, is the best super hero action movie, ever. Forget the actors, forget the graphics and forget the heroics of the hulk, the script is so captivating and the screen play so damn good that it is impossible to feel unimpressed when one leaves the show. I rate this 9 just because I happen to watch it with 5 of my friends, none of the group watching any of the original films of the super heroes. They were confused initially till I find sometime and give them the brief of each of them. And when the movie finished, they were grinning ear to ear, with a promise to watch all 5 movies of the super hero movies. That captivating this movie is! The movie predictably starts slow so as to introduce the superheroes and then picks up speed never to stop. The goosebumps were felt till I left the place to return the 3D glasses :DThen comes the performances. Everyone gave their best performance and the list is topped by the performances of Robert Downie Jr, Mark Ruffalo, Hiddleston and Cobie Smulders. The dialogs were crisply written, entertainingly delivered and thoroughly enjoyed! The 3D was not so worthy to die for. It my be the theater, or the glasses but it is not up to the mark of not even Mysterious Island as I found one of my friend just removing the glasses and watching the film as is. The CGI was good, Iron man just awesome and HULK, no words! I have found the trailers good but living through the scene of the group of super heroes is just a brain freezing experience for me.Go watch it and enjoy it. Definitely can be watched in 3D but 2D in a good theater works just fine. I will watch it again and might probably buy a DVD/Blu-ray for my 42'. Deal!",9,1,4,6 May 2012
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Bigger and better but less funnier
","I am a huge fan of the Avengers. The first edition stole me totally. Thanks to Star Movies in India, I have watched it so many times that I literally can repeat each dialog like a subtitle. It has some of the best lines and the aversion between characters before they can become a group has been impacting and immediate. Coming to AOU, I have had huge expectations. Am I disappointed? Well, I am excited than disappointed on what future holds. The big question I wanted answering was, where is Loki when the world he despises is burning? The character of Loki adds so much to the movie along with Ironman for the wittiness. Why the dialogs weren't as memorable as the first one ( I am sorry, the subtitles killed it for me to remember if there are any). But from the action side, it is total kick ass. The enhancement to the other sides of the Hulk and the BW has added the character depth that was missing in the first part. SLJ, could have had more screen space IMO, but that's OK. The action sequences at the first, the Iron-Hulk stand off and the chase are beautifully handled. Whether it is better than the first is debatable, but it is totally worth every buck you pay to watch it and every minute you spent watching. Total awesomeness and some more!",9,4,11,26 April 2015
