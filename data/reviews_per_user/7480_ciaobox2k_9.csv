","The blair witch project was the one movie that really scared me, I dont watch alot of horror movie because the likes of Scream A guy running around in a mask killing people, It was a stupid movie.

The blair witch project is about a group of student film makers , Heather , Josh and mike who go into the woods to shoot a doucumentery on there local ledgend the blair witch, But when they get lost in the woods the witch starts to haunt them...",8,0,1,21 July 2000

Jerry Maguire," Excellent film. What films should be about!
","Cameron Crowe's 'Jerry Maguire' is my favourite film of all time.  It such a great character driven movie with great writing, acting and directing.  I have wrote a little bit about why it's my favorite film ever. Enjoy...                      Jerry MaguireCameron Crowe's `Jerry Maguire' is my favourite film and when I ask myself why I love it so much, I always come back to the same points:1. Jerry Maguire is a good-hearted decent guy. 2. `Jerry Maguire' is film based purely on story, acting, writing and directing. 3. The film has heart and this movie is what movies should be about.
1. One of the reasons is that Jerry Maguire is good-hearted decent guy. I have been thinking about why we should find this so amazing to see a good, decent guy.  I think it's because there is so few of them out there.  Jerry is a hard working guy who is taking the bad with the good.  He is trying to take his one client, Rod Tidwall and get his career back after being fired from his job at SMI.  At no point does Jerry give up.  There are many times when he had come close because he knew he was over.  But he didn't.  He fought and fought and in the end he succeeded.Jerry makes mistakes like we all do.  He messes up from time to time.  He's human.  It's these little touches that make us love the character Jerry Maguire and be able to relate to him.  Even if we have never been through what he has, we can still see his motivations for his actions and understand why he does what he does.Jerry Maguire's biggest problem is not being able to commit to a woman. He's great at friendships but bad at relationships.  At the end of the movie when Jerry has success he realises that it's not all perfect because he cannot share it with the woman he loves.  Only after his hard work and he has now got success does he realise that he needs to have someone in his life to share his life with.When Jerry worked at SMI he was just, as Jerry says, `another shark in a suit', he was all about money.  He had a job; good money and he didn't really need to commit.  But Jerry's journey throughout the movie has made Jerry grow as a person and made him realise a few things.2. The movie is based purely on story, acting, writing and directing.  This movie doesn't rely on big explosions or effects to make this movie fun or interesting. All this movie has is a great script, actors and a great director.  I love, just like everyone else, now and again to go along and see a big Hollywood blockbuster full of guns, explosions and guys taking out entire army's with only a handgun.  Those movies are important because they allow you just to relax for a few hours and let your imagination go wild.  But these movies are not satisfying full-hearted movies like `Jerry Maguire'. Those movies do not have the heart and soul that `Jerry Maguire' has.  
Tom Cruise acts with such comic skill and is so natural.  He is so relaxed and confident in this role and it's obvious he is having lots of fun. Cruise gives a great heart-felt performance, which is one of the best of his career to date. Child actor Jonathan Lipnicki holds the screen with Cruise extremely well and it's a delight to see them share a scene together.  Renee Zellweger gives a fantastic performance as always delivering the lines with passion.The direction from Cameron Crowe is nothing short of amazing.  The atmosphere that the film has is so relaxed, funny and enjoyable.  He uses simple set ups to shoot the movie which works extremely well because there is no fancy shots which make you think `Wow look at that shot'.  He shoots it so subtly that at no point does it ever distract you from the story.3. The film has heart and this movie is what movies should be about.  It is clear that Cameron Crowe made this movie with passion and a real story to tell.  These kinds of movies do not come along very often.  This movie is the kind of movie that could have been made on a much lower budget and still have succeeded because the movie has heart.  It has a story to tell.  As I have said before, I like to see action movies now and again too, but movies like `Jerry Maguire' are what you call real movies.  The film industry today is treated too much like a business and too many filmmakers make movies for money and not because they have a passion for it.  
Cameron Crowe thank you so much for this film!Ciaobox2k@hotmail.com",Null,3,8,4 November 2001

Eyes Wide Shut," excellent show but pathetic ending
",I thought this film had a very strong and interesting story line that kept you wondering what was going to happen next.  For the film to progress like it did i thought the ending was a huge dissapointment that almost demeaned its built up efforts.  For the events that took place in the film i was expecting it to have had more of a twist at the end instead of resolving things with the characters forgiving each other.  What was Stanly Kubrick's message?........does any one really know?,Null,0,1,29 August 2000
Pulp Fiction," One of Tarantinos best movies
",Quentins best movie so far.. A movie about the day in the life of two hitmen Jules(Sam Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta).who have to get a case for there boss Marcelus. I loved the movie because of the way it went back and forward in time.. A recommended movie...,Null,0,0,20 July 2000
Jackie Brown," A Good Movie But Not As Good As Pulp Fiction
","Quentin Tarantino`s Jackie Brown was a good movie , But not as good as Pulp Fiction. Jackie brown is all about a street tough gun runner (Sam Jackson) A stewardess (Pam Grier) A bail bonds man , A shifty ex con , An over ambitious cop(Keaton) and a beach bunny all have in common ? they are all after half a million dollers. Again as we often see in Tarantino movies we have the time thing going on again where it jumps back and forward so you need to pay close attention, It does not jump back and forward in time half as much as it did in Pulp fiction.. People who are expecting it to be as good as Pulp Fiction will be disappointed. the acting is top class as always in Tarantino movies. Sam Jackson and robert Deniro where top class.. If you are a Tarantino fan its a movie worth seeing.",7,0,1,20 July 2000
