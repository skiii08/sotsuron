Ford v Ferrari," I am not a car enthusiast but thoroughly enjoyed this
","Ford v Ferrari tells the story of the Ford Motor Company after being betrayed by Ferrari in an acquisition deal trying to design a car to compete in the 66' Le Mans race to beat Ferrari first and foremost. Henry Ford II (Letts) recruits Carol Shelby (Damon) and Ken Miles (Bale) to engineer and race a car respectively in order to finally become the first american manufactured car to win the race.As someone who was initially unfamiliar with the story of the 66' Le Mans race; what the build up to it entailed and what happened afterwards I was consistently glued to the screen. In my mind the stakes were high and anything could happen. And this story does not sugarcoat any part of the details. It is an underdog story in the sense that Ford, a much smaller underdog car company that doesn't specialize in speed is going up against a juggernaut like Ferrari, a luxury car built to be expensive and flashy is truly a race. It also shows that there is much more to racing that just speed and design, the driver plays a crucial role. A well-established relationship between the car and driver is frugal because in this race they would have to spend upwards of 24 hours together, they have to know each other and what their limits are, otherwise there will be catastrophic consequences.The acting performances are all fantastic, even if no one really has an Oscar worthy scene. Christian Bale does not quite reach his full potential but is still very transformative as a hot shot arrogant but talented driver. Matt Damon is also pretty good despite his accent not being that convincing. However the standout performance is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, who is determined to beat Ferrari at any costs, including getting into his very own car and trusting his very arrogant driver. His performance inside his own race car was both gripping and hilariously performed. The racing scenes were also very stellar, there is the typical drama that happens inside the pit, but seeing it transform from the pit to the track is really masterful build up, and what made the race scenes so engaging, as well as the directing by Mangold. If a race scene is able to craft so much motion sickness and tension by just showing a shot-reverse shot sequence, then this is a job done by a real racing enthusiast or a great director.There were however a couple of scenes that didn't really work. For example, a couple of character drama scenes. I understand we have to show the life of Ken Miles, his wife and son who are still supportive of his dream. However this really isn't a character drama movie, it is a real life dramatization of events. There are scenes that are kind of meaningless is the larger retelling of the narrative. They might have happened in real life, but there was no real payoff to any of them. For example, Shelby is shown to have a bad heart and would never race again. This is set up and doesn't pay off at all. Many scenes might be telling a real life story, but don't really affect the narrative of Ford v Ferrari. A good fifteen minutes could have been trimmed and the movie would have stayed the same.Ford v Ferrari tells an engaging story for car enthusiasts, it has enough racing to satisfy anyone who has a thirst for high speed action, who may also love stunt driving not extremely dumbed down. It can also spark an interest for people who aren't automotively challenged. It is not necessarily a masterpiece or even a Best Picture contender, but it a solid two and a half our watch. It is fast, it funny and it is thrilling most of the way.",9,4,8,16 November 2019
Zootopia," Fast, funny, beautiful and thought-provoking
","When I first heard of this movie, it looked like it would just be another animal anthropomorphic buddy comedy animated movie, done in a similar fashion to Shrek, Toy Story, Ice Age or Madagascar. I was still looking forward to it after the successes of Wreck-It-Ralph, Frozen and Big Hero 6, but I did think Disney Animation Studios movie started to decline in quality, not by much mind you. So when I did see it, I was completely unprepared for the incredibly profound metaphors this movie sets out to tell and the parallels this movie makes with our own society, while still being funny, entertaining and fast paced for children. Everyone who watches this movie will touch upon the realization that this movie tackles racism, stereotypes and media fear tactics while using species (specifically predators and preys) to outline a form of class-ism. While Zootopia does not say anything that has not already been said before, it does present them in a different way. Our protagonist, Judy Hopps is a bunny, a prey, who is open minded to anyone becoming anything and a sidekick Nick Wilde is a fox, a predator, who believes that people can only be who they are, they both learn of each others limitations, difficulties growing up from the stereotypes associated to their respective species and both animals grow as individuals and as friends. These characters are very well established, as well as their enemies. The villains in the movie are brilliant because, while they were racist (or speciest), they had real motivation and you can understand why they would believe certain things would be true, when they are not. While some of the minor villains could be fleshed out more, the main villains were not racist for the sake of being racist. On a technical aspect, this movie is very well voice acted, in particular for Idris Elba, Ginnifer Goodwin, Jenny Slate and Jason Bateman. The animation is vivid and has a great blend being cartooned for style and realistic for clarity. The movie does a great job of building this world, especially when there are tiny mouses and giant giraffes occupying the same vicinity, so they took in consideration road and cars sizes as well as having certain districts for bigger and/or smaller animals. The score by Michael Giacchino is captivates you in whichever setting it displays on screen. Also if that opening scene featuring Shakira's song 'Try Everything' does not pull you into the wonder of Zootopia and all of its districts, then I don't know what will.As for flaws, there are a few. There are older movie references that adults will laugh at but kids will not. So to anyone unfamiliar to those movies will not understand the humour, and sometimes will even come across as plot conveniences. Between the second and third act of the movie, our two leads will get into a skirmish which to me felt artificial and forced, but it actually helped the investigation come to an end, I understand why they needed to argue, I just don't think it was handed as well as it could. Also some animals seemed smaller than they were so supposed to be, like the mice, sheep and the elephants, and some seemed larger, like the fox and the buffalo. I'm basing this off Judy's size, because in the movie Chief Cape Buffalo Bogo is the same size as an Elephant, while Nick Wilde, a fox is twice as big as Judy, a rabbit.Those complaints really were not enough for be to dock it a mark, I was nit-picking a little too much, but I really love this movie. I think it is the best movie Disney made since at least this decade. I'm not counting Pixar movies though. I do believe this is better than movies like Wreck-It-Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6 etc. Judy Hopps is a great female role model for kids, children looking back at the movie when they are older will definitely catch on the metaphors they missed, and adults will probably love it more than kids, because of how relevant in our society it is. It might be this year's Inside Out and I hope it get's a Best Picture Nomination.10/10",10,1,5,22 August 2016
Knives Out," Truly a masterpiece of subverting expectations.
","Knives Out tells the story of the Thrombey's, an upper class family of wealth and importance celebrating the 85th birthday of the patriarch Harlan (Plummer), a day later Harlan is found with his throat slit and every one in the family, including the servants becomes a suspect, as they all have motive.It is very unique to see a murder mystery that is completely original, not a book adaptation nor a property of long standing fiction. These are original character in a pretty tired premise. When I walked into the theatre I was expecting this to play out like any old game of clue, or Sherlock, with Benoit Blanc (Craig) playing the eccentric private detective that puts every piece together in the end. However by deviating away from the traditional mystery formula, along with a great score and masterful/controlled camerawork, it really unravels its performances and characters in a funny and suspenseful way.This is a stellar cast, the two shining members being Chris Evans as Ransom Drysdale the spoiled grandson of Harlan and Daniel Craig as the inconsiderate southern detective. Both of them are playing against their type are truly transformative in their roles. They were not James Bond or Captain America, they were two people trying to figure out how to solve the mystery looming above them. The supporting characters are also great, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette, LaKeith Stanfield and Ana de Armas as the son-in law, daughter, son, daughter-in-law, crime scene investigator and Harlan's caretaker do not just blend into the movie as they have clear personalities and motives for what they want to do. However some of the cast do just disappear into the movie, particularly Katherine Langford and Jaeden Martell as the other two grandchildren.Given the movie's affinity for subverting expectations, it may render some plot points moot or unimportant at times. Knives Out is no exception, this movie would set up some plot points that would make the mystery loom and linger on, however when everything is revealed these plot points may not get the resolution they deserve. Also some characters really only exist for four or five lines/jokes and then are basically forgotten about by the end. However this might be because of the visual storytelling at the end. With the right context and clues, the audience can infer the real ending, based on nothing but facial expressions, prop treatment and setting displacement. This is how we know we have a true master of acting and directing, when an object is shown and it gives us much more can be deduced than just what is seen on screen.Without spoiling anything, don't go into this movie expecting a traditional murder mystery, the trailers really set it up to be one, but this is a Rian Johnson film. I understand why people were peeved at him for his treatment of Star Wars, mainly because his subversion of expectations made them mad, as people grew up with the characters and story, so in a sense they belong to the public and they didn't like the liberties he took with the new additions he made. But these characters and this story belong to him and he can do whatever he wants with them. In fact the less you know, the better. Expect some foul play.",9,6,16,30 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," An unusual combination of fan service and retconning Episode VIII brings our saga to a polarizing yet still enjoyable end
","Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is set a year after The Last Jedi, Rey (Ridley) is training to master the Jedi Arts, Finn (Boyega) and Poe (Isaac) are piloting the Millenium Falcon trying to help the resistance and meanwhile Kylo Ren (Driver) is now the Supreme Leader and guiding the will of Emperor Palpatine (McDiarmid), who has survived falling into a reactor is orchestrating an army to finally end the resistance.After the polarizing Episode VIII, (which I thoroughly enjoyed), Disney tried to bring back Star Wars to the mystery of Episode VII effectively undermining most things that were set up by the previous installment. It is disappointing that this movie had to do that; it is disappointing that this billion dollar franchise caved so easily to what is effectively a minority of the population. However I should mention not all the retcons were poor, some of them were actually good additions. However this movie could have been more, it should have been more than giving us what we already knew. It effectively wants to play it safe and give the fans something they already had. It does cater to what the fans loved in the original trilogies and some weird fringe groups.By retconning Episode VIII, it opens itself up to fan service and every other moment of the movie is dedicated to it. Some of it was great, as a fan of Star Wars I loved a lot of the ending, safe for one scene. The ending War was excellently crafted, yet a little hollow because it does play it too safe. When this movie opens itself up to fan service, a lot of moments end up feeling like Deus Ex Machinas, which some are earned and justified, other just feel like they had to be there because otherwise fans would riot.What this franchise has taught me is that they will riot regardless of what happens in this franchise, so instead of making a movie that would satisfy the masses, it should be made to be consistent. However this is also a problem that continued throughout the trilogy. The force awakens tried to be too much like a new hope. The fans called it out so to counteract that, the last jedi tried to deviate from the original formula by throwing away fan theories. The fans called it out so to counteract that, they reverted back to fan service. And all I can say is, at least it is not a carbon copy of Return of the Jedi, there are elements that rhyme in succession to Return of the Jedi, particularly in the middle and end, but the setup is different enough to be its own thing.This review may seem negative, however I should note that I did enjoy this movie. Maybe the lighting was off multiple times, or maybe the special effects were a little uncanny. However the performances and character arcs are fully realised for its two central leads. Kylo Ren and Rey have come a long way from who they were in episode 7. Finn and Poe have shown themselves to be brilliant and brave allies. C3PO (Daniels) and R2D2 (Vee) are still very much relevant and hilarious to the stories as they were in 1977, Lando (Williams) and Chewbacca (Suotamo) are a well deserved fan service that did not overshadow the new comers. And although some of the new characters could have gotten more screen time, particularly Rose (Tran), Zorri (Russell) and Jannah (Ackie), they did make the most of their short screen time. The special effects and fight choreography are as good as they ever been; the lighting when done right is very illustrative of character intentions and although the dialogue particularly of Palpatine is a little on the nose and generic, his delivery and the flashing light is very engaging.Even if people are ultimately disappointed in this installment there is something for everyone to enjoy. I'm not saying this movie will balance out the people who loved the original trilogy and people who loved the Last Jedi, in fact quite the opposite, it will probably end up dividing audiences even more. But given that this is the end of the Saga it should finally give audiences closure whether they loved it or hated it, and I thought it was serviceable.",8,2,9,21 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," An effective yet haphazard culmination of twenty-two movies, and much more to come.
","Avengers: Endgame brings us where we left off in Avengers: Infinity War, with Thanos (Brolin) collecting all six infinity stones and wiping out half the universe. In the aftermath, what's left of the Avengers (Downey, Evans, Hemsworth, Johansson, Cooper, Renner, Rudd, Larson, Gillan, Cheadle, Ruffalo, Gurira) all must band together to go back in time to collect the stones before Thanos can and prevent their current reality.When the first Avengers movie dropped in 2012, it proved that Cinematic Universes can work. When Age of Ultron dropped in 2015 and more avengers joined the cast, it proved that Cinematic Universes are busy, also superhero movies need a respectable villain and a movie of that caliber needed more than one solo writer-director. When Infinity War dropped in 2018, it showed that it can subvert the audiences expectations and still entertain while not waste anytime introducing characters the audience has already known for ten years worth of movies. Finally Endgame proved that a movie can completely undo everything the predecessor has done and still be revered for its scope, for its culmination while giving certain characters well developed character arcs.Originally this movie was supposed to be called Avengers: Infinity War Part II; and that's where the first problem originates. It's kind of inevitable that losses in a Cinematic Universe would feel hollow because the actors have contracts and more movies or TV shows they have to complete outside the movie they are currently performing in. When actors contracts expire, there's a realization that they have be given a proper sendoff; which in the viewers mind means, 'don't get too attached to X'. This being a cog in a much larger clock, and setting up something even larger than itself, allows the audience to zoom out and see a bigger picture, and that picture is, 'we need to keep these characters afloat and we need spinoffs and TV shows that we can keep pumping out so we can make money'. And after watching the movie, I am baffled at what they are trying to produce, and it is impossible not to look at this movie and not see a bigger picture.As a whole, the movie is well acted and directed and also wastes no time setting up characters the audience already knows. The action is well executed with beautiful long takes and hits that look like they actually hit instead of quick cuts and shaky camerawork we are unfortunately used to by now. Downey gives one of the best performances inside of the MCU, and the special effects, which probably comprises at least ninety percent of the movie, are all excellent. Unlike Infinity War, the war part actually makes sense and is not just filler until the real bad guy shows up, also unlike Infinity War, the characters that die actually strike a nerve. But where Infinity War succeeded, the lighting is pretty bad in some scenes near the ending of the movie, also the introduction of time travel makes the timeline of the movie confusing and set up for the next movies problematic, because it is impossible to look at this movie and not see a bigger picture.If you have not already jumped onto the Marvel Cinematic Universe by now, there is no reason you should check out this movie. If you are not dazzled by a plethora of famous people jumping around a simulated environment, you're not going to applaud at the resurrection of our favourite heroes, or at the big female team up against the man, (which admittedly felt a little hollow because there is no real set up to it). Anyone who loves superhero movies would love the intricacies of the that are put into this movie. If you started at the beginning with the first Iron Man and watched even seventy percent of the movies in the MCU, you can appreciate the development of our original avengers and like the directions our new heroes are going to eventually take.So in the end, this is a popcorn movie. It is fun, as long as you don't think too much about it. It is a good ending to the Avengers while showing there are more possibilities for our remaining heroes and shows unlimited possibilities for the future, even if I am not interested in some of the spinoffs. Gone are the days, were the studios would just make a movie with a beginning middle and end. Now we make movies that set up more movies, and looking at the bigger picture, this is movie that seems large in its scale but is tiny when compared to what's to come. The big picture looks good, but has some problems in it's connecting pieces.",8,0,1,7 May 2019
Toy Story 4," It hits all the beats a Toy Story film should, although somewhat less effectively
","Toy Story 4 is another story that tackles the difficulties of growing up and moving on. On Kindergarten orientation day, Bonnie (McGraw) creates another toy: Forky (Hale) who has an existential crisis about his place in the world. While on a road trip with Bonnie's family, Forky ejects himself from the family RV, thinking he is trash, that is when he learns what it means to be there for Bonnie and what it means to be a toy. Along the way, he runs into some new faces and some old ones as well. Through many adventures and missteps does Woody realize his place in the world.What the Toy Story movies have always done well is make the audience laugh and this is no exception. Ducky (Key) and Bunny (Peele) steal every scene they are in and are definitely the best additions to the cast, other great additions are Duke Kaboom (Reaves) and Forky who are welcome new addition with their own quirky character traits and well developed character arcs. Although what Toy Story movies do better than any other animated movie do is make the audience cry, and yes, this movie did in the best way possible. Growing up with these characters over twenty years can make one nostalgic for the times they were a kid and think back to all the toys they have had and the lives they might be living now. Toy Story 4 basically takes everything that made the first three great and does it again, but with new ideas and new characters. Although it comes at a cost, and that is it minimizes the screen time of all the characters that were so necessary to the first three movies.Some characters like the Potato Heads (Rickles and Harris), Rex (Shawn), Jessie (Cusack) and Bullseye for example take a back seat while Woody (Hanks) and Buzz (Allen) get all the fun with Bo Peep (Potts) and Gabby Gabby (Hendricks). It is a similar problem that the Last Jedi has as well. An abundance of new characters and old characters is great, they don't have to have arcs, but they should not just sit around while the plot happens. They should be more involved in the story or they should be removed completely. These old characters only exist in the story just because they have to otherwise fans would be upset. What is really unfair to fans is saying a character is in the movie and then having them do basically nothing.My only other problem with Toy Story 4 is the re-animation of old characters like Andy and his mom. It's understandable that animation has progressed over twenty-four years, and it is understandable that animation quality has improved over nine years, since the last movie came out. However the animated appearance of these old human characters is a little unsettling, similarly to that of Princess Leia and General Tarkin from Rogue One. It was done well in Toy Story 3, so I am not sure what happened here. All that being said, the animation is phenomenal, the ceramic, glass and scenery as well as cotton is animated with immense detail, and the toys look more realistic than they have ever, there is no uncanny valley with the toys, or the settings.This is admittedly my least favourite Toy Story movie, but it is still fantastic. It was originally billed as a standalone sequel, however it relies too much of previously established nostalgia to really be its own thing. Admittedly what separates this movie from the group is that it doesn't have that one suspenseful scene. For example, the first one had Woody and Buzz flying through the air, the second had the airplane chase scene, the third one had the toys holding hands in a furnace, number four had no such scene, or if it did, it did not have the same effect as the other three. It's not necessarily a bad thing, in fact it is a good thing that this movie isn't repeating similar beats as the first three. It is essentially the least Toy Story-like Toy Story movie.In the end, the Toy Story trilogy is perfect and did not need a fourth movie in the first place, however I gladly welcome it, love it, laugh at it, cry with it and sometimes even be scared of it. I didn't ask for it, but I am glad it is here. Although the whole movie is basically an elongated episode of 'Tidying Up with Marie Kondo', if the objects were sentient.",9,0,3,23 June 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," Impressive action and great visuals but a repetitive story and trite characters
","X-men: Apocalypse tells the story of an invincible mutant hell-bent on ending humanity, while the same mutants who are derided by humans band together to take him down. We have seen this story before, it is the ninth movie in the X-men saga and the fourth X-men movie directed by Bryan Singer, so naturally there is bound to be some repetition in terms of character motivations, villain establishing and action set pieces. However this movie will take every single one of the aforementioned details and drain the life out of the characters and use excessive amounts of CGI.X-men: Apocalypse will take the younger version of the mutants established in the original trilogy and put them in higher stakes. For the most part, the young mutants do a good job portraying outcasts of society, especially Nightcrawler (McPhee), Jean Grey, (Turner), Cyclops (Sheriden) and Storm (Shipp). While the older cast portrays their counterparts well, without doing a whole lot new. Professor X (McAvoy), Magneto (Fassbender) and Mystique (Lawrence) are very talented actors but their performances were not anything special in this movie, no new ground was really broken for them or their characters. As i previously elduded, a sequel in a series will tend to repeat actions from their predecessor and try to go bigger, and do they ever go bigger by threatening our heroes with an omnipotent, yet clichéd villain with vague motivations and terrible CGI makeup. This movie was made by the same studio that made the truly awful Fantastic Four reboot, so it was not very surprising in how X-men: Apocalypse will make the same mistakes in terms of its third act set up and villain fight scenes, however I did expect more from the man that made 3 good X-men movies and the Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer.Again this movie was directed by Bryan Singer, and other than the look of Apocalypse and a few very obvious green screen backgrounds where practical effects would have sufficed, he does direct a lot of action set pieces very well. In particular two Quicksilver montages and a scene in the woods that gives Magneto's character more depth. Which is something I am tired of throughout the franchise, we know Magneto's backstory and his revenge plot in First Class, he keeps switching loyalties. His motivations are clear, but his constant shifts in morality have grown tiresome to the point where Fassbender does seem to be conveying too much emotion during the final fight scene. Magneto's choices are dictated merely through the actor raising his arms up and him floating in the sky. It is essentially what you would expect a villain to do before a change of heart.Anyone expecting an X-men movie will get an X-men movie. It a watchable blockbuster movie that is fun to watch and engages you in its action sequences. Anyone expecting more than that will not walk away satisfied at the experience. In age where every fifth or sixth movie released is a superhero flick, this one does not stand out. It even acknowledges its repetitiveness in its ending dialogue. I do recognize that X-men Apocalypse was not trying to be original, it is an adaptation of a comic book after all, however it should at least try to throw in some new ideas into an ever expanding universe.",5,2,4,6 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Deviates from the Star Wars formula and stands on its own
","The Last Jedi leaves the audience where they left off, with Luke (Hamill) on the receiving end of Rey's (Ridley) lightsaber pass. Meanwhile, Finn (Boyega), Poe (Isaac), Leia (Fischer), BB8 and a myriad of other characters including newcomers Rose (Tran), Admiral Holdo (Dern) fighting along the resistance. They are countered with Kylo Ren (Driver) and General Hux (Gleeson) the First Order set on a path to eradicate the Jedi religion. One problem with the previous (7th) instalment, the Force Awakens is that it felt too much like the fourth movie, A New Hope, mimicking plot points, character introductions, even death scenes. While I cannot say this movie does not shy away from mimicking some moments from The Empire Strikes back, it does it much less frequently than the Force Awakens. Because of this moment as well as filling in plot points left ambiguous by the 7th chapter, this movie is an improvement over The Force Awakens.Without going into much detail, The Last Jedi delivers on a investing 2nd instalment of the sequel trilogy and give fans of the new trilogy more of what they love while also answering some questions about the Force Awakens and still keeping a realm of mystery in the air. The Last Jedi takes us to new worlds with fun adventures for our heroes of the galaxy fighting along well developed villains in well choreographed fight scenes directed by Rian Johnson. It introduces wonderful new characters CGI and real life, specifically Rose who is given a great backstory and a strong will to fight alongside the resistance. The film also delivers surprising new twists that are not part of the original Star Wars formula established by the prequels and original trilogy, specifically one involving force communication. If you are a Star Wars fan, you will love the extensive world building and sound design present throughout the movie that still suck you into each planet and make you feel like you are there.There are still some problems with the movie though and some that do carry along from the other instalments, many of which are character problems. Captain Phasma although has a bigger role in this movie is still very under-utilized. The new Admiral, Holdo is not a very interesting figure, all she was was an authority against Poe's quirkiness and charm. Finally C3PO, (Daniels) the only character to appear in all the instalments is just pointless in this movie (and in the Force Awakens), he could have been removed and the movie would have been the same. Another problem involves physics, and it involves traveling at light speed and the impulse of one object against another. Without spoiling, and method to take out an enemy's ship would result in everyone dying. And finally there is a problem with some of the looks of creatures. It is obvious that most of the creatures are computer generated and there is little reliance on traditional makeup. I don't have a problem with it if it is done well, but in the case of Snoke (Serkis) or some of the resistance fighters, specifically the ones with large heads and black hair and the look of the crystal hounds, it is very transparent visual effects works. The cinematography is great, just the makeup is lacking.The Last Jedi opens up a complexity to the Jedi world, it shows how resistance against tyranny lives on, it demonstrates that this one dying saga still has more stories to tell, and even though an abundance of characters may slow down the action or make us less invested in the fights, there is still a ton of fun to be had and reinvigorates the series. Anyone who is new to Star Wars should not feel the need to watch the other 7 instalments to enjoy this one, although it would help amplify some of the humour.",9,0,3,17 December 2017
La La Land," Catchy songs, great characters, beautifully shot and expertly performed
","La La Land is a musical that tells the story of three different loves stories, Mia (Stone) and Sebastian (Gosling) developing a romantic relationship set in Hollywood. The other two love stories revolve around Mia and Sebastian's love for their respective career choices, Mia with acting and Sebastian with jazz music. Both of them are struggling to make it in the world, but as they gain momentum their romantic relationship starts to disintegrate. This is a story that has been done before, Sebastian wants to own his own jazz club but is struggling to make money because the world around him wants him to compromise his taste of music with popular current music. Mia wants to make it as an actress but cannot take rejection after rejection after rejection. La La Land however subverts the musical genre and gives the characters some great songs and great characterization. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are great in the roles, especially Emma Stone, they still have great chemistry even after 2 movies, (Gangster Squad and Crazy, Stupid, Love) and for people who have never really sung before, they do an great job, but they are not the real stars of the movie, the real star is setting, Hollywood.Hollywood is beautifully shot in the movie, the direction and cinematography are immaculate. Stellar use of long takes and moving cameras and used to show the beauty of the city. The city is really able to become its own character, it does almost become the antagonist of the story for both Mia and Sebastian, not only for their dreams and aspirations but also for their relationship. It is almost hypnotizing how the film almost draws you into the scene, not only with the setting but also the songs. The songs are well done, they give off an aura of old time classic 1950's music but also sound modern enough for young people to enjoy. However, the use of music sometimes overstays its welcome.La La Land is around two hours long but honestly it doesn't need to be, there are some scenes that just feel like they were included because they look pleasing to the eye, and they do, however it does not justify its means of existing. The scenes where Mia and Sebastian are falling in love last around ten to fifteen minutes but feel like thirty and contain no dialogue, so it can actually be done in around five minutes of screen time. There are a myriad of dance breaks which are supposed to show the chemistry between Mia and Sebastian, but there are at least three scenes that already do that before they finally spark a connection. Also as for other flaws, some of the lip singing done by supporting members of the cast, for example Mia's roommates or the people singing 'Another Day of Sun' are pretty transparent and while I do think the ending was poignant and sticks true to the overall message of the film, I could do without the final montage.Overall La La Land is a very enjoyable time at the movies, if you love musicals you will have a blast with this one, if you don't like musicals you will probably hate this, but you could enjoy it for the beautiful shots, scenery and acting. Out of the two movies directed by Damien Chazelle, I do prefer Whiplash but the movie is still very engaging, I never found my self escaping to my very own La La Land.",9,2,7,26 May 2017
Monsters University," Sullying a great movie with an unnecessary prequel
","I really loved Monsters Inc., it had great characters, tons of laughs for both kids and adults with a lot of heart and a great score. Growing up it still stuck with me. When I saw Monsters University I felt betrayed by Pixar with a prequel that did nothing but ruin characters that I loved, introducing new, boring characters that were basically all the same, including the worst villain ever crafted by Pixar, a cheap marching band soundtrack, and barely any laughs or heart that made me love Monsters Inc.I felt the movie was unnecessary because it was telling the story of how Mike and Sully became friends, a story I didn't really need. John Goodman and Billy Crystal's chemistry in the first movie was enough for me to believe that they were friends since the fourth grade. I didn't need a university movie, which showed an very inaccurate university. But then again how accurate can you show a university while maintaining a G rating?This movie ruined characters I loved, one of things I loved about Sully is despite his rugged exterior he still had a heart and cared for Boo, in this movie he is turned into a stereotypical dumb jock character. What I loved about Mike was his quirkiness and his ability to make me laugh, in this movie he is a selfish, egotistical maniac. I wouldn't have minded if these characters turned into the characters we loved by the end of the movie, but they didn't. Also Randall who was slimy and charismatic, was turned into a weakling who's self-conscious and his transition to evil was so forced, that I struggled to believe that they were the same character. They got rid of characters like Boo, Celia, Mr. Waternoose and Fungus, and introduced characters like Squishy, Art, Terry and Terri, who for the most part I didn't hate but were kind of uninteresting, but Johnny Worthington and his fraternity were so one-dimensional, and the Dean was the worst villain ever crafted by Pixar. Long story short, Mike and Sully accidentally knocked over her scream can, which is why she hates them. It was her own fault, that can wasn't nailed down or protected in any way, it just sat on a pedestal. Someone would have knocked it over eventually.Now it does have its merits, the three scenes where Mike and Sully bonded, that was the closest I came to liking this movie, it had heart and reminded me of the Sully and Mike I used to love. I did laugh at Roz's cameo in the movie. It doesn't teach kids bad lessons, unless saying you can still achieve your dreams without going to college is a bad lesson. The background animation is great for the most part, even though the character animation looked better 12 years prior. And I did like the end credits which showed each respective monster as a scare card.In conclusion, it's not a movie that made me want to hate Pixar, but I would rather watch Cars 2 over this, because while I don't like Cars 2, it didn't disrespect the characters, it had some cool action scenes and while the villains clichés, they had real motivation. Cars 2 added something, to the Cars universe, Monsters University added nothing.",3,1,2,14 July 2016
