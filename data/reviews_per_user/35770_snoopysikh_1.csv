Iron Man 3," Don't Go to theater to watch this movie at all
",after watching that the movie got 8.7 on IMDb i thought it should be a great movie with lots of visual effects and all that stuff which i like to see on big theater screen but what i left with was hours of yawning and looking at other people faces and seeing people making out in the back of theater. if you are a true marvel universe fan than please don't waste your time on this crap. There were some scenes in the movie where even a person like me said 'oh come on really' and i didn't used these lines since twilight series. If you know the history of mandarin you will going to be very much disappointed in this movie.IMDb really disappointed me with this one.,1,26,56,28 April 2013
