The Blair Witch Project," A Modern Masterpiece Of Suggested Horror!
","It amazes me how people who love 'suggested' horror films like Val Lewton's 'Cat People' or Robert Wise's 'The Haunting' ridicule this film when it is the same thing only quite a few notches above those two movies. This truly is a masterpiece of 'suggested' horror where you don't see what is terrorizing these young filmmakers but you know that whatever it is must be truly frightening and extremely cruel. As a result your imagination begins to run away with you. you find yourself wondering what could be after these kids. you wait nervously as you peer through their video camera into the dark wondering what if anything will come out and attack them. All these things work for the film as does the 'documentary' aspect where you are looking through the cameras of these kids. As for the acting being amatuerish, well that is exactly what is so powerful! It reminds you that these are just ordinary people like you and I caught in a horrific situation. I think the overall presentation is outstanding and for some reason that ending, gives me the creeps! Come on people, use your imaginations! If you could do better, why aren't you filmmakers instead of out there hustling 9-5 everyday? This is a classic! See it!",Null,0,1,19 August 2000

",I'm not going to give anything away for those who for some reason have yet to see this masterpiece so don't worry! What I will say is that this is THE best Horror/Suspense movie ever. Outstanding script and story. Unforgettable moments. Breathtaking performances and very chilling. See it! Rent it! BUY IT! You will NOT be sorry!,Null,0,0,22 August 2000
