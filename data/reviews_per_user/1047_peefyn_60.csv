The Lobster," The egoistic love
","Explaining the premise of this movie is as easy as it is hard, because while it is most definitely about people being turned into animals if they can't find partners, that's not what you are going to be thinking about after having seen it.And interesting discussion to have after this movie, is if it has a positive or negative look on love. The movie is really dark, and manages to have a both cynical worldview and naive dialogue. Mostly, the characters talk to each other like they only know of 'love' from books and movies, almost as if they were children. In the closest the movie gets to (what's considered) real love, it's hilariously non-verbal.What I think the movie is getting at, is that people expect love to happen by itself. You will find someone that will match you, in a sense. Complete you. Either this, or live a love life that is a lie. The alternative to this, is that you have to work for love, and sacrifice for it. You might not find someone that matches you, but if both parties work at it, you can still find love. Or something like that.The performances are great, and the movie is hilariously dark. There were so many moments where you couldn't help but laugh, but still feeling guilty for it. The ending has everyone trying to avoid looking at the screen. It's a great movie.",9,1,3,27 August 2016
Love and Death," Some funny moments, but gags are too disjointed
","The trick behind making a comedy like this, is to at least give an illusion that you are tying the gags and the skits together into a narrative (see: Monty Python's the Holy Grail). This is this movie's biggest flaw, because the narrative changes direction in the middle. Or rather, it gets a direction, as the first half was more fleeting. Once the story gets going (with the 'Napoleon'-plot), it's a bit more enjoyable as a movie (rather than a string of gags), but even still it's kind of half hearted.There are some really funny moments, like physical gags, jokes, references and word play, but it's not really enough to justify the entire movie as one story. The performances are also good, both the extras and bit parts, and Diane Keaton's comic performance. Woody Allen plays himself, but does so as well as always.",6,2,4,8 August 2016
Walk the Line," A sadly unfurfilling tale about a great artist
","First: I saw the extended cut of the movie, and when I refer to Cash and June, it is the movie characters I refer to, not the people they are based on.I have a problem with this movie, and it is the way Cash is portrayed. How close to reality it is I can not say, but from what it shows in the movie, he seems to have been given everything without having to work for it. The only thing he has going for him is his talent as a writer and musician.Now, the movie goes through some lengths to show why he became the man he did. A difficult child hood, and being thrown into fame before shaking off his child like stubbornness and selfishness. And then, the addiction and relationship problems, which I am sure made him a much worse person that what he had potential to be.But when the movie only shows this side of him, and not show any change. The moment in the last concert is very selfish of him. Very. And that's what you get before the movie is over (other than the couple of scenes after that).Because of this, I am not too happy with the movie, and that is despite everything it has going for it. The amazing acting and singing done by both the leads, the music, the setting and interaction between them and other stars of the era. All of that is amazing! But when the character whose life you are following is unsympathetic till the end, the movie just leaves me hanging.",5,0,1,9 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," No really, it's OK. Just OK.
","I loved this movie when it came out. I was just a kid, and I remember playing out the fight scenes with friends for a long time afterwords. Quoting it as best as we could from memory. If you had asked me back then, I would have given it as high a score that you would let me.I've seen it several times since then, and gradually, over time, it's gone from 'Fantastic!' to 'Terrible!' to 'Ok' - and the last one is where I am at now. This movie does a lot of things wrong, and it deserves a lot of criticism. Everyone else has pointed it all out lots of times before, so I see no reason to go into it all again here. Jar-jar Bings is an obvious example, and while I don't mind having a goofy comic relief character (like the bots in the original trilogy), this guy lacks all the charm and the warmth that such a character should have. Another annoying part of the movie is all the talk about the trade federation and signing the treaty and so on. While it's all very much a McGuffin (if I'm using that term correctly), it's an annoying one, as it is elaborated on over and over again.But the movie also have some scenes that are great fun. I still enjoy the pod race today. The saber fights are not as fun now as they used to be, but it's still great to see fights with light sabers happening. I love that droids have personalities in the Star Wars movies, something which is neatly carried over to the prequels. There's lots of little easter eggs too to look out for, which I also enjoy. The CGI is dated, but the universe is still great fun.This review makes it seem like it's a movie with lots of highs and lows, but it's more correct to say that it's OK all over. Many of the annoying and great elements happens around each other, at the same time. You can't just skip the boring parts (something I know many fan-editors disagree with), as they are very much a part of the Star Wars universe now. Love it or hate it, this movie is here to stay, and I guess I am thankful that it isn't worse. But it's also sad to think about what could have been.",5,0,5,4 December 2015
John Wick," A great action movie
","This is a great action movie. The premise is as simple as it is effective: John Wick loses everything, and goes on a revenge spree. The reason why it works so well, is that the characters and the setting are both very interesting, and the action scenes are very good.The movie is set in an almost comic book like world, where there's a community of hit men and people in the underworld, with their own set of morals and code. They all use certain businesses (or services), which ties them all together. It's this universe that makes me curious for sequels to John Wick. The characters in this universe are mostly quite fun, and a lot of that owes to great casting. The way they gradually reveal John Wick's past is interesting, and it leaves you wanting to know more about who he once was.But, despite all the good things about the movie, it never elevates above its genre.",7,1,3,30 July 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A side story
","There's some minor spoilers in this review, but to me they are not bad enough to ruin any of the enjoyment of watching the movie.For the previous Star Wars movie, I was all aboard the hype train. For this one, I was looking forward to it, but I was not really following the press about the movie leading up to it, so I went in with less expectations (though still very excited to see it). And I'm happy with what I saw.This movie is very much a side story, and it is felt throughout it. You can see the Star Wars saga in it, not just through the setting, but also through the feeling you get from it. It's a very contained story, on the fringes of the mythos we are familiar with. The soundtrack is and off-shoot of the familiar Star Wars soundtrack. The locations are partly familiar, but also new. It would be natural to watch this along with the rest of the saga, but it would be like a break from the Skylwaker-story, rather than an addition to it. So in the sense that it is a 'Star Wars story', and not an 'episode', it works really well.There is a lot of elements and references to the other movies, and I know some has been critical to these. Mostly I did not have a problem with them, as many of the characters that were familiar, really were relevant from the story, like Tarkin, Vader and the heads of the rebellion. There are even some references that I'm sure most people won't notice (and many that I am certain I did not get). One I appreciated is that you get to see who had the call sign 'red five' before Luke got it in the first Star Wars movie. One reference I can understand people are critical of, is the inclusion of C3P0 and R2-D2. While the fact that they are there probably is not controversial, they're scene added little beyond 'here we are!', which kind of took you out of the film. But it was also nice to see them, and to know that Anthony Daniels didn't miss out on this film (as he has been in the rest of them).Regarding Vader and Tarkin, I must admit that some of the scenes with them made me feel a bit uneasy. It was strange to hear Darth Vader talk in that setting, but say different tings than I have heard him say so many times. I'm sure that the voice was the same (the actor was the same, so it should be), but it still felt a bit off. Maybe this is something one gets used to after seeing the movie more times. Tarkin's appearance was a joy, but I still don't feel modern day CGI is good enough for this. I've spoken to people who didn't notice, but I was thrown into the uncanny valley as soon as he appeared. But I am still glad they included him.This is a different type of Star Wars film, and maybe what I liked best about it was how it showed you the realty of a rebellion. How the rebel groups live dangerous lives, aren't always organized, and can be considered terrorists. This was especially clear in the fight in Jedha's streets. The parallels to the battle we there and what's going on the Middle East are obvious, and hit me hard. I did not expect that from watching a Star Wars film, and I am really happy that they went there. They even touch upon how rebels fraction into groups that work for the same goal, but in different ways.And the fact that this is a stand alone film, also leaves them open to sacrifice more. I won't go into the fate of the various characters, but I will say that I wish we got to bond more with them, so that last part of the movie would have a bigger effect on you. I loved many of the character's, but I've watched other movies that had me care more for the character's in the same amount of time. I'm not sure if they held back, or if they just couldn't fit it all into the run time, but either way I feel we as the audience missed out on many good character moments.My biggest disappointment with this movie, was probably the music. It's good, I guess I am not complaining about it, but I felt that it was a bit underwhelming. There's some of the music from the sagas, but of the new music, it often just sounded like vague imitations, instead of new, powerful themes. Maybe this is also about having to get used to the music, and having it grow on you.And as with all the major Star Wars movies, this is a movie that people will end up seeing many times. And with time, it will be another one of the classic Star Wars movies.",8,1,8,15 December 2016
Passengers," Best at its darkest, average at its brightest
","I assumed the highlight of this movie would be the chemistry between the two (hyper)charismatic leads, but surprisingly the best part of the movie was it's exploration of complete isolation and loneliness. While it's not much of a spoiler, I will not reveal anything specific about what happens, other than that one character faces a very interesting moral dilemma, and that this is a major part of the film.But somehow, this is not the major plot point of the movie. The latter part of the film is about a different problem faced by the protagonists, and is more blockbuster-like and less interesting. It's not bad, it's still a good movie, but it feels like the cop out on a cool idea (the moral dilemma) because they feel obliged to have lots of action and peril.I liked the setting and the scenario, and I would not feel bad recommending this movie as a light scifi-watch, but in it there's a much more interesting movie in the moral dilemma.",7,1,2,2 January 2017
Zootopia," A Disneyfied, thrilling neo-noir
","Walt Disney studios has been anthropomorphizing animals since before any of us were born, and it goes to show that they picked up a couple of tricks along the way. What an amazing world they have created for this movie, with tons of great details both in the forefront and in the background. Some jokes were obvious, while some I'm sure go over the head of the mostly young audience that will see this movie. The different parts of the city, how the animals live together despite physical differences, all of it is a delight to watch. And it's rendered beautifully.There are some parts of this movie that I'm not that big a fan of. The visual style of this movie is nice, but it's also very similar to what we have seen before. In Frozen, Tangled and this, we see Disney turning the style used in their traditional animation movies being converted into these computer generated styles. Maybe it is because other studios has also taken inspiration from Disney's old movies, but the animals in this movie mostly look very similar to what we have seen before in Dreamworks movies, for instance. While it was all still beautiful, the characters all felt like (really nice) 'stock CGI-models'.The ending was a bit of a let down too. It's as 'noir' as the rest of the movie, but underwhelming. Most likely because they did not want to go 'darker', as this is a Disney-movie. Obviously we can't expect it to go as far as 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?', but a bit more would have helped.All in all, it's a really fun movie that everyone can enjoy. I saw this in a 'surpise screening' at the local art cinema (with a room full of cinephiles), and everyone seemed to enjoy it a lot. Despite there not being a single child in attendance. People were laughing and crying, jumping in their seats and going 'aww'. Disney knows their stuff.",8,20,51,16 February 2016
The Hustler," Exploring talent, character and masks
","The Hustler follows 'Fast' Eddie Felson, a pool hustler with personal problems. Perhaps it is because I am too used to modern movies about people with talents, but I found it refreshing how little the movie attempt to explain the activity (here: pool). We see some of the shots they make, but the movie is never about pool itself. It just happens to be the venue used to explore something different: the relationship between a person's talent, his character, and the facade he puts on.The highlight of the movie is probably the performances, combined with some great dialogue. The latter is likely not realistic, but it's gripping, and a delight to listen to. Paul Newman shines in his role as a conflicted winner and/or loser, and Gleason excels in portraying a man that is both capable, proud and talented, but also a subordinate coward.I love how the movie opens. You hardly get any background information about the characters, but are allowed a feel of them seeing Eddie first doing his regular hustling, then attempting to beat a famous rival. Had the rest of the movie been able to be as thrilling as these, the movie would have been one of my all time favorites. Sadly, I think much of the remainder of the movie is notably weaker, especially some of the scenes showing him building a relationship. Many of the scenes are delightful, but some feel excessive, not really taking the story anywhere. The performances are good, and as mentioned there are some really sweet and funny scenes between them. And the relationship between the two is important, and ties into the other themes of the movie.It's a recommended movie, even though it might not feel as relevant today as it once did.",7,1,2,17 June 2016
Spotlight," Telling it like it is
","This movie is great both for what it does, and what it doesn't. There's so many traps you can go into making a movie like this, I and salute those who managed to stay clear of them.I don't know enough about the case itself or the people involved in it to say anything about how authentic it is, but it all feels very close to the truth. None of the characters feels forced, or put there only to keep the story together. It does not seem like they try to squeeze the most out of certain characters that they suspect will be popular with the audience. It's all a dynamic, natural story being told.And the story is good. All the president's men proved that investigative journalist can be exciting without any love stories or action scenes. The thrill of the search, the leads and the clues, it all adds up together to a great story (pun intended).And it's told in such a roundabout way. This is what happened. These were the people involved, and here they are doing their job. The movie is intense when they situation is intense, and not due to any audience manipulation.It is a great movie. I am not sure why I am not scoring it higher, because I am not good enough at this to diagnose the flaws. But when the movie was over, I felt that something was missing. And I hope it's not because I want the things I'm praising the movie for avoiding.",8,0,0,18 October 2016
The Hateful Eight," Combining a slow pace with great action
","This movie is brutal. What happens in this cabin is absolute hell, and if you are not up for laughing at moral depravity, shy away from this movie. That said, the laughter is not from schadenfreude, but from the surprising ways the story takes you, the gruesomeness of some of the situations, and so on. While most definitely a slow, brooding movie - it's also a really funny one. Especially some of the reoccurring motifs, like the situation around the door, a letter, and the physical transformation of Jennifer Jason Leigh's character.People have compared this movie to an Agatha Christie novel, and the set up is in many ways hearkens back to those kind of stories. But it is still distinctly a Tarantino take on it. There are several spots in the movie where a Poirot-esque scene (where a character reveals what he has learned by deduction) would not have been out of place - but Tarantino doesn't let much plot be revealed in this way. A lot of the dialogue in this movie consists of the character's talking about the other character's back stories (or their own, for that matter). And considering how trust and lies are important themes in this movie - it kind of makes sense. It does take a bit away from the realism, but Tarantino has a way of creating a cinematic reality that is believable despite the exaggerated situations and dialogue.Tarantino succeeds in combining a slow pace with sudden bursts of action. Through most of the movie, the tension is high, and you know something will go down soon. Here is my main critique of this movie, because at some points the movie loses its momentum, leaving me impatient. It usually grabbed me back in shortly, but these dry spells were noticeable.On a more personal note: I had really been looking forward to Morricone's return to making a western soundtrack. The result is good, really good, but I had expected the soundtrack to be more like the ones he made for Sergio Leone. Seeing as how such a soundtrack would not be that fitting for this movie, it's ultimately a good thing he didn't. So while I am satisfied with a great soundtrack used well, I'm also a bit disappointed for what I didn't get.",8,3,11,17 January 2016
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Solid western about two personalities
","This movie is in some ways pretty uninspired. It follows two clever and super talented bandits with hearts of gold through a period of their life. In that regard, it's a run of the mill western. Don't get me wrong, they are both very likable, and the chemistry between them is really good. But as far as plot goes, it is nothing new.What makes this movie stand out to me, is how unusually it is structured. I find this to me true with several of the movies written by Goldman, but it's not a typical 3-act ordeal, where you could summarize the excitement with a graph. It goes from here to there, and navigates expertly through moments of peril and moments of calm.",8,1,2,28 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Not strange enough
","Marvel has found a winning recipe, and though I do not agree that all of their movies are the, I would love for them to stray a bit further from their formula. Dr. Strange is different from the other movies in that it covers a different aspect of the universe they are working with, and it allows for some different types of actions and gags. But other than that, it's more of the same. The plot itself is not all that interesting, and the characters feels a bit too dumbed down (to the point where it seems like anyone are open to completely changing their allegiance over nothing). It was fun to watch, but it's hard to not think about the potential that is there.The visuals of this movie is great, but mostly they consist of distorting architecture and changed gravity. There are few nuggets, with branching of hands and other worlds, and this is the kind of things that could have made this movie into something completely special. Hopefully they want to push in that direction in the future.",7,1,2,4 December 2016
The Grapes of Wrath," A good adaptation
","Most things are done right in this adaptation. They took a good book, found a good director, took the time to find good locations and make realistic sets, hired a stellar cast, and tried to find the essence of scenes form the books, and present a shorter yet faithful version of the story. It's hard to blame the producers, writer and director for cutting away parts of the book, just as it is hard to not miss the parts that are not adapted.There are some tweaks to the story that changes the tone a little, especially regarding the ending. I find myself forgiving it, due to the time it was made in. Had a modern day adaptation taken similar shortcuts (in order to achieve a happy ending), I would most likely not have accepted it. The same goes with how certain characters at times are a bit exaggerated. It feels right in a movie from this time, but maybe only if you are used to watching old(er) movies like this.",8,0,2,11 June 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Chemistry and physics
","I had not seen this movie in years, remembering it to be god awful. I remembered wrong - though it's still very(!) flawed.I have two main beefs in this movie, which I summarized in the title of the review: it's lack of chemistry and physic...al presence.With chemistry, I refer to the chemistry between the characters, and as Anakin is in the center of the story - the lack of chemistry between him and the others. It's most obvious between Anakin and Padme, where a strongly chemistry is heavily implied, but completely absent from the movie. The same goes to the bond between Obi-wan and Anakin, where they talk about it as a love/hate parent/child relationship - but it doesn't come of like that at all. McGregor and Portman seem genuine in their attempt to portray such a chemistry, but it doesn't make any sense when seen in relation to Christensen's performance. Now, I don't want to put all the blame on Christensen, as I am sure he is acting as he is directed to act. It seems like Lucas really wanted it to be obvious, beyond any doubt, that Anakin would turn to the dark side. So instead of having Christensen act as a normal human being (or corruptible Jedi), he has him acting like an angsty 13 year old. Which wouldn't have been much of a problem if any of the other characters acted accordingly.With physical presence, I mean: the interaction between the actors and the CGI. I don't think the technology was ready for what Lucas was trying to achieve with it. Lucas has been a really important person when it comes to SFX, and pushing the limits of movie visuals. In all his movies, including this one, he has played an important part in developing the methods, technology and techniques used by movie makers. I am really happy for him daring to take chances on this. But that doesn't change the fact that big chunks of this movie looks really, really bad. You can almost the green screen shining through the backgrounds. Either limiting the story, or working more in tandem with practical effects, would have helped this movie a lot. Not only to stand the tests of time better, but to feel more rooted in (a) reality. To give the characters - both human and cgi - a physical presence.The dialogue gets a lot of critique as well, but I honestly believe that it would have worked a lot better if the aforementioned problems had not been there. Especially the 'sand'-lines delivered by Christensen wasn't as jarring as I had remembered. His super awkward hitting on Padme was, though - because of the lacking chemistry between them. He felt more like Torgo (from Manos: Hands of Fate) than Bond.So that's the bad parts. What I didn't remember was that there were many parts of the movie which I thought were nice, though far from used to their full potential. The opening scenes in Coruscant had some gems. Obi-wan jumping out the window to catch the droid was a really good scene. The execution wasn't perfect, but the the reckless yet calculated part of it really shows of what a Jedi can be. Their control of the force, combined with a cold bravery, opens for thrilling scenes - but is sadly not really employed that well. Cheesy as it was, Anakin dropping out of their vehicle could fall into the same category. (I also wish they would have Obi-wan do a real investigation, more noir-like. Oh well.) The droid factory scene was also a nice callback to movies like Modern Times, where the interaction between man and mechanics can lead to some great stunts and moments. Again, this movie only delivered a hint of what could have been. Sadly. A good gladiator fight are always fun. Less good ones are less fun, but I still enjoyed it. I'm also glad the movie allowed Yoda to show his mastery. I remember how much I enjoyed that scene when it arrived in theaters. Now, much later it felt forced (no pun intended) and abruptly ended. Anakin and Obi-wan laying awkwardly on the floor didn't help.I might be way to forgiving on this movie. Probably because this is Star Wars, and at heart: I still really like the story of Anakin becoming Darth Vader. The execution is disappointing, I wish they had done much differently, but I take what I can get.",5,3,7,12 December 2015
Ant-Man," Great gags, but not enough
","Guardians of the Galaxy kept me smiling throughout the movie, Ant-man did not. And I felt it should have.The movie does a lot of things correctly. It shows how Ant-man's powers actually are really cool. And that he completely holds up as a superhero. It introduces some really cool characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And it has some great visuals at time (though some sequences were disappointing). How it plays around with shrinking/deshrinking is also really fun. They have quite a few really funny gags. But there was room for many more. Too much of the movie is exposition, they could easily have cut down on the opening explanations and introductions. (Or: What do I know what they could have 'easily' have done or not, I've never made a movie. But it felt like there was way too much.) I had a hard time distancing the movie from Edgar Wright. I knew about his involvement, and I was looking forward to seeing his version from the moment it was announced. And I was really disappointed when it was announced he wouldn't direct it after all. So watching the movie, I kept thinking about what the sequences could have been. Instead of what they were. Hopefully I will be able to appreciate it more next time I see it.",7,1,11,8 August 2015
Nightcrawler," Desperation and moral depravity,
","Gyllenhaal either made this character his own, or it was written for him. He is perfect as the deranged 'nightcrawler', and I'm sure the movie would not have worked as well without him.This movie deals with situations of a graphic nature - however nothing worse than what you can see on certain crime shows or other movies. However, by showing it indirectly - as a news broadcast, or through a camera, it feels more real, and you feel guilty for watching it. The attraction of sex and violence.I am not American, and not used to American-style news, so for me this felt all a bit exaggerated (and it very well may be). The media situation portrayed in the movie is one spiraling downwards, and hopefully reality is not that bleak.In addition to the graphic content mentioned earlier, the movie is also interesting in what it does not show. There is talk of blood on a character's shirt, but it is never shown. The same with sexual encounters that are mentioned, but not shown. This fits well into the above mentioned theme of the movie.In the focus of this movie is interplay between desperation and moral depravity. Lou's character is not brave, his sense of moral is missing. Through him, the desperate (the two other main characters) try to solve their own problems. Doing this, allowing Lou to continue his work, corrupts them morally - but it helps solving their problems.My main objection I guess would be that it's hard to how Lou ended up where he is in the beginning of the movie. Some hints are dropped at how he spent his time, but he 'learns so quickly' that it's hard to believe he would be at the point the movie opens on.",8,2,3,28 March 2015
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," This is a funny comedy, that stays away from low hanging fruit
","This movie never elevates beyond comedy (and slight satire), but it's really good at what it is. It's a funny movie. It's just a well crafted comedy.While the characters are all caricatured, they're still rooted in some sort of reality. They're dumb, but they're not Zoolander-dumb, they're not like characters from a kids movie. The conflict is actually quite believable, and it's never taken too far. The same goes for the reconciliation. It's easy to believe in. The most silly part of the movie is probably the songs, but they mostly work within the universe that's established.What I like the most, though, is how this movie tries to deliver solid jokes that stands on their own legs. It doesn't succumb to non-sequitors, sudden nostalgic references or slapstic. All of these forms of comedy has their use and place, but they're often overused, and a method of getting cheap laughs. This movie stays clear of those, making it all the better.The fun had by the people making this movie is also obvious, and you can't help but share the joy of it all. The cameos are fun, and well done.",8,0,1,28 February 2017
The Revenant," Savage.
","The Revenant is a really well made film. Almost every shot is flawless, the acting is brilliant, the dialogue is great - you have to start nitpicking to find things to critique. Yes, you can see that they have used CGI a couple of times, but it still works really well. The movie is a bit long, but I never lost interest in it.The story is at its surface a classical western, almost. Revenge, kinship, man versus nature, and so on. To me, the most interesting part about the movie was how it explored man as animals. You see the settlers looking at the natives as savages, and you also see the settlers acting like savages in front of the natives. If anything, this movie shows how cruel life can be, and how bad circumstances can bring out the worst in people. On the surface, there is a 'good' and an 'evil' side of this story, and the villain of the story is at times cruel. But at the heart of the conflict is the will to survive, at any cost. Humans are animals. The natives know this, and thus are more in peace with the horrible conditions. The settlers struggle with this, and thus turn into savages.",8,0,1,10 February 2016
Bridge of Spies," Lots of things going for it, but should have been more nuanced.
","So little was needed to make this a fantastic movie. The story itself is great, the insurance lawyer ending up way over his head, but approaching it with perfect calm. The mysterious spy. THe tension of the cold war. And the people involved in making this movie are also fantastic. From the Coens, to Hanks, Spielberg and so on. The movie looks good, and the actors do a good job.It seems like they tried to make a movie that is a bit more nuanced than good versus evil, where the characters aren't just black or white, but complex moral beings. But it doesn't really succeed. I like the way they explore the act all of the nations has to put up, and how all of them blunders, but do try to avoid war. But at the same time, the movie does not take the time to show the East Germans and the Russians as more than narrow minded. It was a terrible situation, and it should not be excused, but even a big movie like this should try to do justice to the (very real) people who lived back then, on all sides of the conflict. Much like Donovan does, in the movie.The movie is somewhat split into two, and the first part is definitely the best.",7,1,3,6 November 2016
Divergent," A movie that offers little to others than its target audience
","For a movie that celebrates critical thinking, it does not really allow much of it while watching. The futuristic dystopian setting is hard to accept, and even if you do, it's difficult to understand the motivations of many of the characters in it.It is similar to many other 'young adult' movies, and it probably hits its target audience better than it hits me. But, allowing for some plot holes and similar, I wish the setting had been more interesting and understandable. Maybe this will be more in focus in the later movies? Why the society looks like it does? It is never really awful, though. If you manage to go along with the premise, the movie is easy to swallow. Perhaps a bit too long, but mostly the movie kept the story going throughout.",5,2,3,28 February 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Disappointing, but still okay.
","I have generally liked all the Marvel superhero movies, but some less than others (obviously). I had high hopes for this one, which might be why I ended up so disappointed in the result.Most of the movie is built around the quarreling between the heroes themselves, but this ends up being uninteresting, and feel more like an excuse to have them go at each other. But even the fights have such low stakes that it's hard to get much excited for them.The villain's plot makes little sense (to me), and seems to be based a lot on luck. Without going into to much detail, it would have been impossible for the villain to anticipate and plan for the situation in the end. But perhaps we are supposed to understand that he is just improvising some sort of plan B? Either way, it was not very interesting.The movie does some things right, though. The movie did not feel over crowded, despite the absurd amount of heroes involved in it. They all felt like they belonged in the roles they were in. Ant-man and Spider-man stole every scene they were in giving me hope for the future of the marvel movies.",6,8,18,8 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Caters to its fans, but there's enough there for the rest of us too
","This movie has a great cast and a very interesting setting. The cast inhabited their characters and the universe well, with Redmayne making his character feel more sincere and interesting that it probably has any right to be. The setting, New York in the 20s, could have been used a bit more, but I guess it's a fine line between too little and too much.The story itself is just fine, where the clumsy hero manages to make a mess for himself, at the same time that something more sinister is going on. It's obvious that they are building up for a story to lasts many movies, and mostly they do a good job making a story that feels self contained, but that also leads into a bigger picture.My main problem with this movie, is the side-quests (to borrow a term from the gaming world). There's quite a lot of time spent on them retrieving beasts, something that is only partly related to the underlying conflict of the movie. I'm sure these scenes are loads of fun for those who are into the Harry Potter-universe, as you can see the creatures come to life. But as I am not really that engaged in that world, I got tired of that part of the movie pretty fast.That said, the rest of the movie is enough to make it interesting, if you like these kinds of movies. And I'm sure this is a movie that many people will end up seeing many, many times.",7,0,3,25 November 2016
Dirty Dancing," Not for me, but I can understand that people like it
","I'm not really sure what to say about this movie. I can understand that it is a well liked classic, as I'm sure almost every part of it - from the music and dancing to the relationships in it - hits it target audience right where it should. The fact that I'm not a part of the target audience doesn't mean it's a bad movie.With movies like this, that doesn't really try (or need) to flesh out its character, it's always interesting to see how the characters hold up with time. How some of the characters are portrayed would maybe be considered mean if the movie was made today. Or maybe it's in those cases a realistic depiction of the time and setting it was set in? I don't know.The (acting) performances are not too impressive, and especially Swayze didn't always convince when showing emotions. The dancing is well done though, both when it is genuinely meant to be good, but also when the actors are supposed to be bad. I also really liked the setting itself, the naivë dance camp for rich families.So what can I say? I am not trying to be objective in my rating of this movie, but I feel I have to point out that much of what didn't impress me (the plot, the characters, the relationships) were done intentionally, and hits home with many.",5,1,5,15 December 2015
No Country for Old Men," The silence and the talking
","This movie does two contradicting things perfectly. It uses silence really well, and communicates a lot using other means that dialogue. Even in scenes with conversations, it feels like more is being communicated by what you see than what you hear. But at the same time, the dialogue is some of the best you'll see in film. The way people talk, both the accents and what they say, makes it feel like you're immersed in a really good novel (which the movie obviously is based on), while at the same time it feels real. Together, it makes for a movie that says a lot when it's not saying anything, and is stunning even when the characters are talking.It's also a movie that can take many re-watches. Partly because there are so many good moments, and it's visuals being so good. But also because it has an ending that might surprise you the first time around, but that you'll get a more understanding for when you know what's coming.",9,1,1,15 January 2017
It Follows," Has you looking at the background, and not just for the great visuals
","Going in, I was really skeptical of this movie because of the plot. Someone had explained it to me, and it really just sounded like the kind of ghost stories I found the most boring. The super natural sexual killer. This movie manages to find the potential in those kind of stories, and conveys it brilliantly.I'll focus on the aspect on the movie that I liked the most. Because of the situation depicted, where one never knows what appearance It will have, and only knows that it will be walking slowly towards you, this movie has you constantly looking at the background. This is a brilliant move, as it helps keeping you on the edge of your seat. But it also requires the movie to have interesting visuals, because looking at the background and being annoyed by it would make the movie worse. By accomplishing both having the audience looking at the backgrounds, and also have the audience enjoy the visuals of the movie, the movie makers has really done a good job.What I did not like: How it's out of question to contact someone who might research/experiment on It. It's easy enough to find a big, open area, and have a car ready to escape. But as in all horror movies, you have to allow the characters to make some decisions you disagree with.",8,3,11,20 July 2015
Beasts of No Nation," Understanding the 'beasts'
","This movie is about child soldiers in an un-named African country, and it manages to show both the horrors of (civil) war and the beauty of Africa at the same time. Its biggest achievement is convincingly showing the human side of kids who end up doing horrible things in war. Despite seeing them being brutally violent, you are also able to recognize them as victims.The performances from everyone involved are fantastic. A lot is said by the expressions of these kids, and it's not hard to believe that the movie cast people who had been involved in a civil war like this. Idris Elba does a great job playing a terrifying character, that could easily have been overplayed by a lesser actor.I also very much liked how the movie doesn't really have a character that serves as a moral compass. Abraham Attah's character is obviously not happy with everything, but one of the points of the movie is that these kids don't initially choose this life, but rather end up in it due to circumstance.",8,3,3,2 May 2016
The Theory of Everything," Incredible performances, and an interesting character
","When you make a biopic of someone who is still alive, it is extra challenging to keep the balance what is true, and what is glorified. And when you make a movie that cover a number of years, you're going to have to make some shortcuts.The scenes in this movie that were done for exposition or explaining difficult concepts worked quite well, and while you know it's one of those aforementioned shortcuts, they do not break the flow of the movie at all, or take you out of the realism.The story is a great one, and one that needed to be told. Because of his illness and his genius, it is difficult to understand Stephen Hawking as 'just another guy' - but this movie shows us how he struggles with the same emotions as the rest of us. And he shows a difficult relationship in a way that respects both parties.That said, I do wish they could have explained Hawking's importance in the world of physics a bit more, as the movie shows that he is talented, but does not really delve into his talent.The main attraction in this movie is the acting. Redmayne's performance seems to be spot on. You realize from the moment he moves that he is the perfect choice. Felicity Jones did a great job too, balancing the emotions of the character. The rest of the cast had good performances too, but maybe less to work with.One thing that was a bit odd was the colors. I'm not into the lingo of this, but it was almost like the whole movie had been run through an instagram filter, which was a bit jarring at times.",7,0,0,2 April 2015
Ex Machina," Sci-fi at its best
","Ex Machina is an exploration of a concept, but it does not rely on a gimmick or a twist. Because of the themes explored in the movie, like AI, and what it means to be human, it is not possible to surprise the audience with a big revelation regarding if someone is human or not. The audience will already be asking those kinds of questions about every single character. This movie could have easily gone down a route where it's twist after twist, and I'm thankful that it did not. (I am not spoiling anything here, just saying something about the way the story is presented.) This is a very 'current' science fiction film, where most of the technology presented feels plausible - if not now, then soon. This leads to the movie serving a purpose, in addition to being a good story - because it forces you to reflect over certain parts of technological progress (without being a Luddite either). I'm curious as to how well this movie will hold up over time, as we advance into new technology and mentalities.I like that the movie addresses quite a few of the thoughts one as an audience would have regarding the technology, the situation presented, etc. It does not speak down to the audience, and does not try to hide anything.The story itself is maybe the movie's weakest point, even though it too is really good. At times, I had a hard time understanding the character motivations, and the interactions between Ava and Caleb didn't feel like 'enough' to set of the chain of events that happen. But this is all nit-picking, because over all the story was good, the performances were excellent, the visuals were great (they manage to keep a low budget without showing it and the soundtrack was interesting and fitting.",8,1,5,16 February 2016
Big Hero 6," Delightful superhero movie targeting a young audience
","What I appreciated most about this movie was the setting, having neither been to San Fransisco nor Tokyo I cannot comment on if it is true to either of them - but I really liked the city and the culture that resulted from it.You can hardly see the effect of the technological advances that has happened in this world, and because of this it feels like it's in the near future. As it is a movie for younger audiences, it is understandable that they want it to be easily relatable.The parts of this movie that I did not like are probably some of the parts that the younger audiences will like the best. The Fred-character was partly delightful, but also 'too much'. The same with some of the moments in the film (like the suggestion given by one of the heroes in the last fight). Some of the motivations of the characters are also simplified so much that they are hard to understand.If you are a comics geek, I recommend staying till after the credits!",7,32,46,27 February 2015
The Imitation Game," An historical drama that falls into the usual traps
","It can't be stated enough: Alan Turing was (is!) a hero, and the way UK treated homosexuals back then was inhuman.And now on to the film: This is an important story that deserves to be told. The casting of Cumberbatch was perfect, as he manages to portray both the genius with social difficulties and the emotional, misunderstood outcast. The conflicting emotions in some of the scenes feels genuine, and he especially nails some of the more challenging scenes near the end.My problem with this film, however, is the (oscar winning) story. The people above Turing in the chain of command, like the character played by Charles Dance, are so one dimensional and villain-like that they completely pull you out of the movie's realism. There are other moments too (they are running of time! the police are circling in on him!) that feels exaggerated, due to this being a movie and all. And while I am not saying that a movie ought to be 100% accurate, I wish that it would try to be a bit more realistic.",6,0,1,15 March 2015
Jurassic World," Blames the audience
","I liked the dinosaurs, didn't mind the CGI (but would have preferred animatronics), and I would probably prefer that it did not go over the top so often. And then there's the gender issues. And the stupidity of all the characters. All of this is very much out in the open.What is more interesting, is to see all the effort the filmmakers put into acknowledging the expectations of the audience, and responding to the expected reactions they would have to the plot.One of the first scenes acknowledges the feathers-or-no-feathers-situation, and they make passing mentions to it later on in the movie as well. The same goes with the over the top plot of the movie, which it acknowledges and comments on. But it all falls kind of flat,a s it only acknowledges the choices they have made, but do not really comment on them. For instance, it makes fun of naming dinosaurs after products, but still features product placement heavily. It mentions how the audience always expect more and more, and the only way to make them happy is to give them more. Which is what this movie does just after.Basically: It acknowledges the challenges of making Jurassic Park 4, but rather than provide a solution, the movie gives up and blames the audience for wanting what it gives us.That said: It's a fun movie. It's hard to go wrong with dinosaurs and Pratt. But I wish they had higher ambitions.",6,9,21,27 June 2015
Logan," Consequences
","It's about time for the X-men franchise. They were early pioneers in the modern day superhero movies, but they didn't evolve, and were outshined by the MCU-productions that elevated the genre to a new level. Light hearted superhero action films are now a dime a dozen, and no one does it better than Marvel studios.Nolan brought Batman in the opposite direction, in stead of light hearted, he made films that took themselves seriously. Later DC movies continued this trend, with Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. The X-men franchise reacted to this (and the Marvel movies) by going in a completely different direction: Deadpool, a movie that doesn't take anything seriously. Its success could easily a unraveled the entire franchise into 'edgy' Deadpool-like movies, but instead they opted to make a movie that not only takes superheroes seriously, but takes itself seriously. With Logan, there's an X-men movie that does not shy away from the bleak, and exploring the actual consequences of the themes they've already been rambling about for several movies.Logan is a dark and bleak movie. There are fun scenes and a healthy dose of black comedy, but it's mostly a movie that beats up both the characters you've gotten to know, and the ones you've just been introduced to. And it shows how everything in the fictionally world they're in have consequences. It's not just another movie that you watch, and at the end nothing much has changed. It's a result of a divided world, the extreme suppression of mutants, and so on. Obviously what happens in the film will also have consequences for the characters involved in it, and while this is hinted at, I think they could have gone further in exploring how the extreme violence would/could affect the young characters in the film.The soundtrack is good, the visuals are sometimes really good, and the acting is fantastic. Both Stewart and Jackman blows it out of the park.",8,2,6,7 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The fine line between spectacle and spectacular
","In my opinion, 'too much' is never a problem if it is handled right. Everything can be on the line and happen at once, as long as it is presented by someone who can craft a story. With the Avengers-franchise, it has to be big, it has to be everything, but this also increases the difficulty of presentation. For, if done wrong, this movie could have easily become a transformers movie. The (cast and) crew deserves kudos for managing to make it bigger without losing their heads, and without losing the audience. The movie manages to present, update and focus on each of the many characters the Marvel Cinematic Universe as accumulated so far, in addition to managing to introduce new ones.The major exception to this is maybe the Vision-characters. I am not familiar with this character in the comics, but I had a hard time understanding how powerful this character is, and just what he can do. At one point he seems like a Dr. Manhattan-esque guy, but at other points it's just another avenger-like hero. This will probably be more clear in the later movies, but that's not good enough.Another problem this movie had was that ultron's army was as boring as any other stormtrooper-like characters from other movies like this. While the avengers did work together like a team, it seemed like many of them were at points reduced to fly-swatters. Maybe it's hard to avoid, but it's not really that fun to watch. The movie also had some good one-on-one fights (that were way more interesting).Something I missed in this movie, but I guess will be more important onwards (with the next Captain America-movie in particular) is the relationship between the world society and the avengers. It was only briefly touched upon, but I guess a movie can't do everything.As many others, I much preferred the first avengers-movie, because of a more interesting villain, and more memorable moments. This movie was also funny, though. Thor in particular. And the Hulk.This is another one of those movies that you can't really miss if you are following the franchise, and you probably won't pursue if you haven't followed it. It's good, not great, and it doesn't disappoint, but at the same time it does not exceed my expectations.",7,2,8,28 April 2015
Frank," Fun, and not as weird as it could have been
","I wasn't sure what I was going into seeing this movie, but I was delighted at what it ended up being. Mostly.It's a pretty straight forward exploration of creativity, fame, and to some extent mental health. It's not so much about what good music is, but rather how talent evolves, and perhaps how it's more than something inherent in one person. I especially loved their take on the idea of making popular music, and Frank's attitude towards it.I like how they used the 'creative isolation' aspect of many (real) musicians story in a fictional setting. I can't remember having seen that being done before.All that said, the movie doesn't seem to have much ambition to be more than a fun movie about silly characters. There are touching moments and an arch to many of the characters, but other than some (kind of heavy handed) comments on talent and fame, it's mostly 'just' a fun ride. I'm not saying that that's bad, but I'm sure there's material enough in the story to take it even further. Especially in developing the relationships between the characters, and the motivations (which at times weren't that believable).",7,1,1,4 April 2017
La La Land," Right kind of nostalgia
","This movie has some fantastic shots in it, and it manages to bring some of the amazement you can get from watching an actual musical live. The songs are mostly not that memorable, but they're always welcome when they come. They're also spaced out in an interesting way, fitting with the emotional flow of the movie. The actors do a terrific job playing their parts.Even though I can easily get caught in nostalgia, I am also quite wary of it. This movie delves in it, but luckily it does in a way that feels thought through, and in the end it seems like it comes to terms with the fact that the present ain't so bad either. You can try to recreate the past, or you can bring the positive aspects of the past with you as you head into the future. To me, the latter is the most appealing, and it's how I felt this movie handled it.All of that said, the movie never excels. It's a nice musical with great acting, impressive shots and a nice setting - and it deserves praise for all of those things. The complete package works nicely, but it it's no great loss to miss out on this movie.",7,1,7,30 April 2017
Snowden," A different perspective than Citizenfour
","Citizenfour is a great documentary, and says most of what needs to be said about the time Snowden spent in Hong Kong. This movie does not spend too much time on this, so it works more as a companion piece rather than a fictionalized remake.But it is fictionalized, and while the general facts about Snowden's life and motivations seems true, it's obvious that the scenes going on the NSA headquarters are dramatized. I'm sure Stone had to do some guessing to figure out how it all works in top secret bases, but it also seems like he used the freedom to ad some excitement and Hollywood-moments. In a movie like this, that's to be expected. But the story of Snowden is so interesting that I'd like to know exactly what went down, despite some details maybe never seeing the light of day.Joseph Gordon-Levitt captures Snowden brilliantly, especially his voice mannerisms. The movie ends in a way that would have been risky has Gordon-Levitt not been such a capable actor.",7,1,5,16 October 2016
Sicario," Bleak and brilliant.
","I am not observant enough to know exactly how they did it, but this movie feels almost like a documentary. The 'establishing shots'(?), bird's eye view or at an angle, probably helped. They could have been made digitally, but somehow they felt more real. Like the movie was showing that these are real locations. Long takes, and the camera not always in the middle of the action, probably helped as well. It really made the movie feel grounded in reality. I'm not familiar enough with cartels, FBI operations and the other players in the movie to say anything about how realistic it actually is - but it was all very believable.The plot itself is both intelligent and interesting. It's all about force, where the ones with the most power are the winners. People using each other. Hopeless situations. Not exactly sunshine and rainbows.Lastly, the cast is amazing. Josh Brolin has found his calling in these 'no bullshit'-characters, similar to the ones he played in MIB3, No Country for Old Men and Inherent Vice. Emily Blunt was great in Edge of Tomorrow, and she is just as great in this movie. Del Toro makes me want to see every movie he's ever been in.",8,0,2,19 October 2015
Steve Jobs," Captivating performance
","I was hooked almost as soon as the movie began, and I followed the flow of Sorkin's dialogue all the way till the end. The movie could have easily lasted for an hour more and follow Jobs through the rest of his career. But I'm sure it would be harder to keep it thematically together, at least the parts of the story that they chose to focus on.I've never been all that interested in Jobs, but I was completely captivated by Fassbender's performance here. But to me, he did not feel much like Steve Jobs, but rather a (brilliant) character that uses the narrative of the historical person 'Jobs' as means to unfold himself. In a way, it was odd to see this movie made about people who are mostly alive (or recently deceased) because it feels more like characters in a play than it does any sort of biopic. (But as I'm writing this, I'm wondering if this is something I truly felt, or only expected to feel due to the reputation of the movie and Sorkin's writing.) But even though I found the movie enjoyable from beginning to end, there's not many big moments in it that'll stick with me. I can imagine it being very rewatchable, but not all that memorable.",8,0,0,30 April 2017
Whiplash," A movie more about pursuit of mastery than drums and music.
","I know little about music and less about drumming, but this movie is not about the craft, it's about the pursuit for mastery (or even perfection). If you go into it knowing nothing about jazz, I'm sure your interest will be peaked.In this movie you follow Teller's character Andrew and Fletcher, the character played by Simmons. Both deliver fantastic performances, and considering they are both supposed to be practicing a craft on a high level, it's very impressive that they manage to do so convincingly.The entire movie follows Andrew around, and by doing so you understand what kind of life he chose to live, and while we don't see anything, what we see is sufficient to fill in the rest. The girl he dates is only seen in a couple of scenes, but you completely understand the relationship and Andrew's thoughts on it from them. The same when it comes to his position on friends and family. Simmons portrayal of Fletcher is very successful, in that he is a beast, but you find yourself rooting for him despite it.And to end with the ending: I am still having a bit of a hard time saying if it's a happy or ending or not, but I really did enjoy it.",8,3,7,6 April 2015
Kong: Skull Island," A good looking monster movie
","There's not much more to this than 'a good looking monster movie'. More specifically it's a movie about people stuck in an unexplored habitat where they face pre-historic monsters. It's not really a remake of King Kong, because it leaves out most (if not all) iconic moments from the previous versions, and it also tells a story completely of its own.The highlight of the movie is, beyond a doubt, the visuals. There are some glorious shots in this movie, and perhaps the best ones being those that are obviously influenced by previous media set in the Vietnam war era. The creature design is also really neat. King Kong is massive, and he's also definitely not an ape as we know them. They've taken more inspiration from the old doll (from the first movie), than the more natural looking Kong from Jackson's remake. And it works really well! There's other creatures as well, some of them quite neat and interesting. Some of them I would have loved to see more of, but the 'skullcrawlers' (which are highlights as an important enemy) are disappointing design wise. They look like a generic baddie in a monster film.The plot itself is OK, but there's nothing really special or interesting about it. There are some great performances, but also some talent that is completely wasted in roles with hardly any airtime.",6,0,2,29 March 2017
Arrival," Beautiful, scary and realistic
","The last sci-fi movie about a linguist I can remember seeing, is Stargate. And that movie didn't even attempt to seem realistic. One of Arrival's great feats is presenting linguistics in a (close to) real way, and making it really interesting. The same is true for its approach to other sciences. The time they have spent making it feel and seem accurate pays off really well.The science has gotten quite a bit of attention, but it's not what I liked the most about the movie. The highlight was how (scaringly) it depicts the world's reaction to what happens in the movie. It's terrifying, and it's the reason science fiction as a genre is so important. It gives us a (possible) reflection of a side of us that we hope we don't ever have to face. Because I can see countries reacting as they did. And citizens. Uprisings, panic and fear, all spiraling out of control into a unbearable situation. The movie is not filled with this, but it's in the background and in the back of your head throughout the entire film, and it's scary. It's almost like I wish everyone would see this movie, so we would know better.The concepts explored are all very interesting. Humanity's reaction, as mentioned, but also the scenes showing first contact and how it is handled. This is not a movie with a big twist, but it does hide something that is hinted at, and that pays off well in the end.It's also visually a very interesting movie, and the soundtracks fits it really well.",9,1,6,3 December 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Great movie with the perfect cast.
","This movie has a fantastic cast, and not only because I like the actors, but because it seems like each role was tailored for them. Norton being a brilliant actor, but difficult to work with. Keaton living down his reputation from Batman, Stone as the cynical smart-mouth, it all just fits. I'm sure the way the movie was made, with the long takes, had its effect on the chemistry between the actors, as they all had to be in tune to make it work. (Speaking of tune: The soundtrack was really interesting as well!) The movie explores fame, celebrity, success, creativity, but probably most of all: coming to terms with who you are. It does so successfully, by expanding the theme from Riggans character to all of the supporting characters as well. They are all in it together, and all struggling with the same things, albeit on different levels.So, what's not to like? While it's hard to pinpoint exactly what I didn't like, the Birdman-sequences didn't quite sit with me. The relationship between the Riggins-character and Birdman was interesting, I think I would have like it better if it was downplayed a little, and more indirectly hinted at. Maybe. Either way it is a very good movie.",8,1,4,20 May 2015
The Big Short," Dumbed down in the right way
","This movie describes a world that is completely foreign to me in a way that acknowledges it's complex, but at the same time does not speak down to me. I'm not American, but despite this I am absolutely furious about what the movie says about what happened during the crisis.At the same time, the movie has a clear agenda, and I obviously do not know enough about the subject to be able to judge if it's misrepresenting things. The movie feels plausible though, and maybe that's because it is so open about what it is. It breaks the fourth wall at times, plays around with the medium, and does what it can to explain things in a straight forward way. Often what happens is silly, and in those cases where it's actually true, the movie points it out.The aforementioned 'playing around' works well, though it's easy to go too far doing it. Here it manages to keep you into the story (an impressive feat, considering you're following several stories at once, and all of them about economics and banking), despite all of its quirks.The cast does a great job, both the A-listers and the rest. I wish there were more scenes with certain characters, but at the same time, the balance does work well.",8,0,0,3 December 2016
Straight Outta Compton," Unconvincing version of an interesting story
","I know little about the story of N.W.A., and this movie might be on the money accurate - but it doesn't manage to present the story in an convincing way. You feel like you're watching the version of history preferred by the surviving members, and that it glosses over some of the negative sides of the relationship. Not all of them, mind you, as there's enough on screen to keep the drama going. But I don't buy it.That said, the most interesting part of the movie was how it portrayed the police. That actually felt convincing, and helped explain some of the background for albums like 'Straight outta Compton'.The acting was mostly quite good, and the rapping as well. Sadly, O'Shea Jackson Jr. isn't quite up there amongst the others, and it does distract a bit.",6,2,16,12 September 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Of gods and men
","My main thought while watching this movie was that it had ambition. While other superhero movies often don't aim higher than any other action/entertainment-movie, this movie aims to be something more than any 'run of the mill'-movie in the genre. This high ambition is apparently also the reason why so many people do not like it, as many report that it's a 'swing and miss'-scenario. I disagree, though the movie obviously has its flaws.The movie has lots of references to mythology, and the theme of 'gods and men' runs through it all. In a way, it's like the Marvel-movies are like the myths of old, with gods amongst men, but often with plain good or evil characters. If that's the case, then Batman v Superman tries to be like how the myths were treated in the renaissance. Basing their art on the old myths and characters, but adding to it levels of artistry, meaning and complexion (that on some level were inherent or implied in the original myths).Now, I am not saying Zach Snyder is Michelangelo or a renaissance artist, but that the movie's ambition is to treat the 'myths' of superheroes in the same way. Does it succeed? Not all the way, but I am more than satisfied with it.It might have been explored to death in the comics (I wouldn't know), but I really liked the exploration of moral, power and justice. All the 3 main players (Superman, Bruce Wayne and Lex) has their own take on it, and they are all valid (to a point) - but their belief-systems are all shaken up throughout the movie. Someone more skilled in philosophy than me could probably line them up with various thinkers. Not unlike Watchmen (the graphic novel or Snyder's movie adaption), scenes and thoughts from this movie could probably be used to understand moral dilemmas.The plot movies on in an unusual fashion, but not hard to follow or confusing. It jumps a bit back and forward, and it does require more from the audience than many other movies of its kind. It takes itself really seriously, which is a really good thing. Why shouldn't it? It seems people have forgotten that the Dark Knight-trilogy did the same thing, before the Marvel cinematic universe went into high gear.The main trio (Superman, Wayne, Lex) are all interesting characters. The supporting characters are not explored too much, but Alfred, Perry White and Lois Lane are all enjoyable in the scenes they are in. The music is mostly really good. The visuals are mostly stunning, though I don't always agree with Zach Snyder's (lack of) colors. The big climaxes works well.My main nitpicks with this movie are just that: nitpicks. There's quite a few small, silly decisions. Like beeping, blinking trackers (that probably should be harder to find). The introduction of the wider DC-universe could probably have been handled a bit less 'in your face'.I still have lots more to say about this movie, and I'm sure others will too. It's a movie that lends itself for discussion, and not just 'what scenes did you like the most', but rather holding it up against the real world, and discussing the characters in light of modern day society. As I am already beginning to ramble here, I will end with saying that I hope the studios try to mimic this movie, instead of Deadpool - that they dare to explore the very interesting themes that are inherit in the concept of superheroes, instead of carelessly laughing it all of with blood and destruction.",8,1,5,27 March 2016
Son of Saul," Fantastically crafted.
","I feel guilty for posting this review, for I think Saul fia is brilliant in many ways, and I want more film makers to experiment, and tell their stories in a creative and original fashion, like László Nemes.There are some minor spoilers in this review, but not any that would ruin the movie for you.The part of the movie which will probably get the most attention is the way that almost the entire image (which is small, 'academy ratio') is at all times mostly focused on Géza Röhrig's character Saul. The camera follows Saul more closely than you have seen in a movie before, often leaving very little room for other than his head. The most obvious reason for making the movie this way is that it forces you to 'complete' the setting using the sounds provided. Even though you do get some good looks at the horrible things happening at the concentration camp - I'm sure you will remember much more than what is actually shown on the screen. If this had been the sole reason for filming this way, it would have been a really good and memorable gimmick. But you can also see how this helps tell the story of Saul. Saul has been mentally weakened by the time he has spent in the camp. We don't learn too much of his back story, but we learn enough to know he has been in better condition than he is as the movie starts. The Saul you meet from the beginning of the movie seems all alone in the world. He blocks out the others (and the travesty happening around him), resulting in an entirely selfish personality. This is reflected by the way the movie is shot, because in the screen you see only what he sees: Himself.Another thing I really liked about this movie is how real it all felt. Obviously I do not know much about how life really was like in the camps, but the way this movie handled it felt real. Previous movies I have seen about the time spent in concentration camps makes it seem like everything is organized and controlled, but in this movie, the chaos of it all makes it all seem more real. And all the extras feel like they are supposed to be there, and have been given clear instructions on what to do. For a movie that leaves so much of the background to the imagination, they really did work hard to make what it shown pretty much flawless.So why do I only give it 6 out of 10? I am not sure. By focusing on an 'anti-hero', the other prisoners seem all the more human, as they are almost always friendly with Saul, despite the things he does. But at the same time, I completely lost interest in Saul's project, his motivations and how his story would end. To me, the movie only works if you look away from what's in the dead center of it - Saul - and it might be that I am not a good enough watcher to be able to do this. I appreciate the film and can completely understand those who love it. But because I can not help myself from focusing on Saul's story, I was often times bored with the movie. I do not mind Saul being an unsympathetic character, and I'm fine with him being an anti-hero. But I wish he had traits that made him more compelling to watch. Because I can't be more specific than that, I'm also open to me not being a sophisticated enough watcher.",6,9,16,30 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," J.J. brought a balanced, not forced, return to the Star Wars saga
","I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but if you still haven't seen it: stop reading about it, and go see it.In The Force Awakens, as with other reboots and sequels of old franchises, it's a challenge to balance the old with the new. The two previous trilogies were both of their time, and different in many ways. This new one will also need to be of its time, and different from the other ones. Story wise, it's obviously more connected to the original trilogy. In addition to this, the structure of the movie itself is very much based on the older trilogy. Much of the movie acts like a parallel to episode IV, while at the same time feeling different enough to not be considered a remake or rehash of the same ideas.As in other sequels, the original cast - now old and weary - is back in this one. Without going into spoilers, I will say that they all did a superb job acting wise, and I liked the way their stories has progressed. What's more interesting, though, is that is the new characters you end up feeling most excited about. It's great to see the old cast, and they are very much involved in the plot, with important parts in regards to action and plot. But still, it's the new characters you come out of the cinema thinking about, and look forward to seeing again. Especially Kylo Ren was interesting. I like how they portrayed the conflict between the light and dark side of the force, it's much more believable than it feels in the other movies (especailly the prequel trilogy).The movie is much more busy than the previous films. I think that's natural in today's cinema environment, and that it works well. Watching it, the story just kept on giving, and there was great, fantastic scenes throughout. I wasn't bored for a second. I can see this disappointing some fans - but as mentioned before, I think that Star Wars movies should be of their time. The special effects were fantastic as well. The practical effects, like costumes and so, worked brilliantly in conjunction with the newer stuff. The few CGI/Mo-cap-characters that had big roles were maybe the weakest point SFX-wise, but they were by no means eyesores.The movie ends in a way that to me was satisfying. It's obviously the first part of a longer story, and there's many more questions to be answered. Some less significant questions I assume will not be answered in the big movies, but rather TV-shows or other media. The big questions will obviously come back in the later movies. Especially regarding the back story of certain new characters, and the whole situation in the galaxy. (On that note: I liked the opening crawl. Informative and to the point. Neiter the crawl nor the rest of the movie is too heavily focused on 'what happened in-between' VI and VII.) A last note: I've seen people complain (and worry) about too much fan service. As a fan, I am mostly very happy with the choices they made.Take this review with a pinch of salt. I was very much a part of the hype leading up to this movie, and I might have other thoughts after a re-watch or two.",10,92,202,16 December 2015
What We Do in the Shadows," Vampires, 'the new guy', sharing a flat and coming to terms with change.
","I love how everyone, not only the main characters, are so naive and clumsy. It's the same with Flight of the Conchords (the TV-show). People blindly accept almost everything being said to them, and even in extreme situations they react with confusion or awkwardness. I think this is what makes the Clement's comedy work, but it required that the audience is willing to accept these unrealistic responses to the crazy scenarios.The movie plays around with tropes from the vampire setting, and puts it up against the 'living together'-situation which was also used in Flight of the Conchords. This combination is really odd, but they make it work. The storyline is something like: 'A new, young guy becomes part of the group, which leads to complications' - but that's all these guys need to make a funny movie.If anything, the movie could have had a bit more on the line for these characters, if only for the potential for more comedy. There is also a (kind of) serious moment where one character reflects on immortality, and it worked well enough that the movie could have had more of this without losing its comedic charm.Oh, and Stu seems like a great guy,",7,1,3,20 May 2015
Deadpool," Refreshing, but with very low ambitions
","I was not aware over how popular this movie was before I went to see it, and I usually do not like being the dissenting opinion on films like these. But I really did not like Deadpool. While it might seem daring for movie studios to make an R-rated superhero movie that doesn't take anything serious, it ends up being completely uninspiring. Pleasing the teenage 'meme-generation' is easy, and basing a movie around their mentality is the same as going for the lowest common denominator - only here it is within this target audience. I have heard people calling this movie 'intelligent' because it does not feel it has to explain anything to the audience. I would argue that is not the case. This movie is targeted at such a specific (but large) audience that it can easily skip explaining a lot. I'm not saying the movie would have been better if it did, but rather that it does not make for a clever movie.The non-caring attitude of the movie is not a flaw by itself, but rather the fact that this seem to be the only sort of ambition the movie has (in addition to trying to be an entertaining movie, which it obviously succeeded in, based in the general consensus). But the over the top action, the juvenile humor and the constant references to popular culture mostly ends up being lazy and cheap. There are some good gags, and even some great ones, but they drown in the rest of it. I do like that it makes fun of the superhero genre, and that it is not afraid to completely abolish the fourth wall - but it does it while still making the same mistakes other superhero movies are making, which kind of invalidates the points it might(?) be trying to make. As I seem to be in the minority here, I am open to giving it another chance - but most likely it's just not a movie for me.",5,19,44,27 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Fun, especially for Anglophiles. Villain a bit weak, though.
","This movie was fun! If you are at least partly Anglophile then there is a lot in this movie that you will enjoy. If you also like over the top action sequences, then you're sure in for a ride! The movie prefers style to realism, and gags to deep thoughts - which I do not mind at all. It is also meta in many ways, a celebration of the genres that inspired it.The main flaw in this movie is the villain. In the movie they refer to the Bond-movies only being as good as their villains, and if that was the case with this movie, it wouldn't be that good. Jackson is charming as always, but the character itself is not that interesting. Luckily, the heroes are more than enough to keep you entertained, and the grand plot really does not matter that much.And wow, Colin Firth really shows a new side of himself in this movie! Another thing: I am a bit uncertain about how the movie tries to convey an anti-elitist message. The main character is not born into luxury, but was it not for his father then he would not end up in the position he ends up in. And he does not seem to mind the privileges his newfound occupation gives him.",7,1,7,28 February 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," Good action in an increasingly absurd setting
","Just as the previous movie in what appears to becoming a franchise, this movie delivers solid action sequences that are a blast to watch, and probably just as much fun to make. The action in this film makes it feel like a video game come to life, and in a good way. I'm sure people will look to this the next time they try to make a movie like Max Payne.Like the previous film, this is not much beyond an action film - but it does seem like they're intent on establishing a quite unique world. Just how far they are willing to go with it, time will tell, but right now it seems like half the population of this world is involved in an assassin underground, while the other half is utterly clueless. The fact that Laurence Fishborne and Keanu Reeves appear together is no the only parallel to the Matrix.It's also a movie that doesn't shy away from having a little fun instead of keeping to any sort of realism. And because the world the movie is set in is kind of silly, it works well enough. I think it went a bit too far when the characters seemed willing to shoot passersby (like in the fountain scene), but mostly they try to keep them within the strange moral universe they have established.",7,8,16,21 February 2017
Inside Llewyn Davis," A road movie with little traveling
","Much like most other movies by the Coen's, this seemed very different to everything else they have done. Before seeing it, I expected it to be a sincere attempt at portraying a Dylan-like figure, with a heavy focus on the music itself, and also with a whole lot of nostalgia. This is kind of true, but these are not the aspects of the film that'll stay with you (even though the music was really good!).There's not really much of a plot in this movie, but it's so well crafted that you hardly notice. Llewyn has a goal, but it's obvious from the start that this movie is not about reaching that goal, but rather about his every day struggle, and the life as a folk musician in an almost mythical period of music history. Llewyin is an interesting character, flawed but easy to like. His struggle feels real, and plays into an overarching theme of how your fate can be out of your hands, but also how perseverance can lead to something good.The movie is similar to road movies in that it features a lot of different characters that Llewyn meets and interacts with. Some of these are very much Coen-esque, and I'm always amazed by how Coen manages to establish such layered side characters, despite them only appearing on screen briefly. Bot casting and writing must be stellar to be able to do this, and they seem to do it all the time.It ends in a way that makes the movie more than just a mood piece, and opens up for some interesting discussions. Once again, they've managed to make a brilliant film.",8,2,3,30 April 2017
Spectre," Fighting for relevancy
","The Bond series has always tried to cater to its audience, and each iteration of the character probably mirrors the movie going audience of its time. During Brosnan's run, the producers seemed to go all in for the more unique sides of the Bond franchise, with gadgets and over the top action. Craig's Bond is different. The 'modern' audience wants human characters with many sides to them. Because of this each Craig-movie seems to become more and more personal, and happening in a world rooted in reality. But what place does the classic Bond-character have in today's world? This is the problem faced by both the producers, AND the characters in the movie itself - they're both fighting for relevancy.While the Bond movies are more rooted in a 'real' world than ever, they are still trying to maintain the feeling of watching a Bond movie. The highest praise I can give for this movie is that is succeeds in doing that pretty well. Craig manages to deliver the catchphrases without any wink to the camera. They play around with the Bond car in a way that will most probably delight the old Bond-fans and also have the 'modern' fans not groaning. When it comes to the Bond girls, instead of trying to find a balance in one relationship, they have two quite different Bond girls. I could go on, but my point is that to me, this all worked well.Sadly, the story was not that exciting. The twists and turns were not that interesting. They try to seal up all the loose (and not loose) threads from the last 3 films in a bow, even though I never found myself asking for that. After having seen the movie I figured it was because this was Craig's last Bond film, and they wanted to complete his arch - but it turns out he's (currently) signed up for the next one as well. I love Craig, but this would be a good moment for him to pass the torch.I wouldn't recommend anyone to avoid this movie if they like Bond movies. It's worth seeing. They do a good job on balancing the new and the old. But I'm fairly sure I will have forgotten the rest of the plot by next week.",6,3,8,7 November 2015
The Nice Guys," A recommended watch, despite its flaws
","This movie is great fun, and it's easy to narrow down why: The performances from Gosling and Crow, and the characters they portray. Not only are there several instances of hilarious dialogue and banter between the two, but even some first class physical comedy, way ahead of most other action/comedy movies made these days. Especially Gosling has some hilarious moments.It's hard not to compare this movie with Shane Black's previous film 'Kiss kiss bang bang', which also includes a hilarious duo that stumble through a mystery that's way bigger than the both of them. There are some differences, though. In KKBB, the balance of competence is very uneven, where Kilmer's character is the competent one, and Downey plays the moral compass. In the movie, they are more even, with Gosling and Crow both playing deeply flawed characters, with each their strengths. The balance works, and much like KKBB, they are hilarious together. In KKBB the female sidekick is also a love interest, while in this movie it is the daughter of Gosling's character. The setting is a bit different, but it is still set in the entertainment industry, and with some similar locations.The movie suffers a bit from too much build up, with too little pay of. There are several elements introduced that seem like they are supposed to pay of in a funny/interesting way later on, but that end up only being used in one or two gags. This movie would have lent itself perfect for running gags, and there's one that has great potential, but is dropped quite quickly (a character that accidentally kills the wrong person a couple of times).There seems to always be some sense of self-awareness in Shane Black's movies, where clichés are either broken, or commented upon. Ryan Gosling's character has a moment in the movie here that very much keeps up with this, where he acknowledges the streak of luck he seems to have. I love how Black plays around the tropes and clichés of the genre, but wish that the story/plot would be as solid like KKBB.So, while this does not hold up to KKBB in many regards, it's still way better than most others out there, and I highly recommend watching it.",8,1,5,14 June 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Beautiful in all its disgusting glory
","While it is difficult to believe in a world where people start wars over fossil fuel, people are into suicidal extremists by being misled, and wealthy white men controls the wealth - wait...Mad Max is brilliant. It is beautiful in all its disgusting glory, and it holds on to you for almost its entire runtime. There are some spots left in so that you can catch your breath, but mostly it's all just chasing and being chased. Mostly the latter. Despite its post-apocalyptic setting the movie manages to burst with color in every scene.The movie did slow down a bit in the last act, or maybe all the action exhausted me, but it never got boring. The only parts of the movie I did not like was when they tried to connect their world to ours. Some parts of it worked, like how they (re)used old technology, their religion and how they spoke. But especially one scene ('shows') was jarring.",8,3,8,18 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," A movie split in two, where one part outshines the other.
","While not as stylistically done as Full Metal Jacket, this movie is also clearly split in two. The first part of the movie covers the training, and the second one the war itself. I was not too fond of the first part (though it did have some fantastic moments), but the second part was so intense that when the movie was done, you have forgotten about most of the beginning of the movie.There's something inherently difficult with movies like this, and it's unfair because it's not a fault of the movie itself. There's been made so many American war movies that portray an exaggerated heroic narrative, without any nuance, nor feeling that you are watching something that actually happened. Many of these movies were really good, but the tradition has led to me always being skeptical of these movies, especially when they say they are based on a true story. Now, Doss was a hero, and he more than deserves the portrayal of him in this movie, but it still feels hard to trust.The first part of the movie is about the all American boy with an abusive father, deciding to do what he thinks is right. It really does feel like Mel Gibson proposing to the American audience. But, in between the rosy red scenes of wholesome American life, there are some really good moments. Hugo Weaving is incredible in this movie, and he steals every scene he is in. Especially a scene where the family is eating dinner, and he reacts to Doss' brother enlisting. Fantastic acting.The second part of the movie, though, is great. From the Forrest Gump-like American boy in the training camp, it throws all the characters into war, and demonstrates beyond any doubt that war is hell. It's graphic, hectic and terrible, and it's impossible to look away. Despite everything happening at once, the movie manages to show what happens, and give you the feeling of being out there, and share a taste of the reality these young men were facing. And to think that this happened every day, many places, for years. They are all heroes, but the latter half of the movie is not so much about the glory (except some slow-motion sequences in the end). Which is how the heroes should be displayed. As (sometimes unwillingly) brave humans thrown into a situation beyond comprehension. And doing it because they believe it's the right thing to do.The movie is worth watching. The historical inaccuracies are there, but they don't seem to be too major, and Doss was actually even more of a hero than what ended up on the film. The latter part is really good, and Hugo Weaving makes the first part enjoyable as well.",8,2,5,12 December 2016
Goodfellas," Both sides of the medal
","There's much to say about Goodfellas, and most of it has already been said by others. What I enjoyed the most with the movie was how it constructs this dual reality. You see and hear all of these guys having a blast, enjoying their money and their power. You can hear Liotta's character describing the joys of the life they led. At the same time you are presented with certain scenes from this life where you can also see the backside of the medal. Many mob movies are like this. They show this really charming culture of, well, people celebrating their own importance, and a culture based on respect, tradition and hierarchy. But then you typically see it all falls apart, so it wasn't a good idea after all. This movie plays around a bit with this, showing you both sides of the medal from the get go, but as the story progresses you can gradually see the medal turning around, going from having the positive side in focus, to having the negative side in focus. But, as mentioned, both sides of the medal are visible from the start till the end. This is maybe the most obvious in the ending scenes, with how the narration relates to what you see.",8,0,0,8 August 2015
All the President's Men," You're solving it with them
","Doing research can be fun and exciting, but it's not really a spectator sport. It's difficult to imagine how you can show people making phone calls and checking documents in a way that is both thrilling and realistic. But this movie does it really well. It brings you into the case, and by selecting some of the more important moments, it lets you follow it in a fast pace, while still feeling that every discovery is worked for. It's like you are taking part in the whole investigation, from the sidelines. And the movie is mostly no BS. You follow the investigators as they are working, and the work that they do. Sure, these are people with lives and emotions, but when it's not related to the work, they don't show it.This movie is also interesting to see, as it shows how much work research could be before the digital age we are now in. It probably pairs up well with modern films like Spotlight for that very reason.",9,2,2,30 July 2016
The Martian," Wrong approach to the book
","I have read (and loved) the book, and I am not distancing myself from that in this review.There's many ways to adapt material, and in a sense, The Martian is very faithful to the book it is based on. Obviously you can not fit an entire book into a movie, so you would have to skip parts of the plot, etc.. The book the movie is based on is in large parts the astronaut's first hand account of what is going on, the logs he writes. The movies have him making video accounts of the same, so we can hear the character say the lines instead of writing them. All of this makes sense.What I disagree with, was what the movie decided to put its main focus on. It has picked a couple of moments from the book and spent quite a lot of time on them, and fast forwarded through the rest. This has the effect of making Watney's stay 'easier' then it is in the book. To me, the book was at its most interesting when Watney was coming up with great solutions, and explaining how he did so. The movie has some of this, but skips most of explanations, choosing to rather 'show than tell' (which you'd think be a good thing).That said, I thought they picked great actors to play all of the roles, and all in all I appreciate how close to the book the movie was with what it decided to have on screen. I wish the movie all the best, but would really have preferred if it was done differently. I don't know how, but for this movie I would not have minded an almost continuous voice-over. Or at least for the movie to be longer. Or maybe replace most of the parts without Watney in them, having rather the ongoings on earth being related through other means. I don't know what would work the best, but the direction they went for was a big disappointment to me.",7,13,111,23 September 2015
