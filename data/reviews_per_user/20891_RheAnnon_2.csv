The Ring," A little freaky
","I went to see this movie having only seen the previews for it, and had no idea that this was a remake of a Japanese movie (no, I am not Japanese). I am a huge horror/suspense fan and am not rattled by much.  As the movie opened, the whole time limit on when one was going to die reminded me of Feardotcom, which I thought was incredibly stupid.  So I thought that it would be sort of like that, and it was.  Hear about a movie that kills people, try to make it so that it doesn't.  I was not prepared for what was on the movie, nor the journey that the main character would have to take to make it right.  The main character was very strong, and, being a female in a horror flick, did do some of the typical female things (i.e., watching the movie).  But I was pretty amazed by this movie.  I definitely wasn't prepared for the ending.  By the end of it, my heart was racing and I was scared to go home alone.  And the subliminal images (yes, there were subliminals) were a good touch.  I saw one of them, and none of the three people I was with did.  I felt that the movie did a great job with the story.  Even though there were holes, it didn't hurt it.  I left trying to figure a few things out.  It really made me wonder, and I like that about a scary movie.  I haven't had real nightmares from a movie since Candyman came out (I was 12).  I still haven't been around a T.V. alone.",8,0,0,11 November 2002
We Were Soldiers," Wonderful
","If you like military movies, you will definitely like this one.  Mel Gibson's character, Lt. Col. Moore, is one of the best speakers that I have ever heard.  It is not what he says that gets to you, it's how he says it. He is completely honest, he holds nothing back.  And he keeps his word. The movie would make anyone associated with the military proud.  You feel like you have a connection to all of the characters in this movie.  You feel the pain of the wives when they get the news of their husband's deaths, and the fear of the stranded soldiers when they learn that they are surrounded by Vietnamese troops.  This movie was truly breathtaking for me.",9,1,2,21 July 2002
