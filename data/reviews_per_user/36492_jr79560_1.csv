The Benchwarmers," I feel sorry for spade, lovitz, and schneider
","Hermaphrodite, gay, virgin, and toilet jokes abound in this disturbing excuse for a comedy. If you are looking for a 'little guy wins big' type film, watch Little Giants. Little Giants is actually appropriate for children of all ages, it is sad to hear other reviewers mention that they took their 13 year old to this piece of garbage that is all to common in Hollywood today. The adults in this movie take the kids mail box smashing, a 10 year old asks Spade what does biatch mean and his mother says nothing and continues to hit on Spade, Jon heder goes no.2 in a port a potty and some guy pukes in the bushes after catching a whiff, all of which are crude without being funny. While watching this baseless drek I feel like I am forced to view Adam Sandler's favorite porno websites. My favorite quote 'I'm going to kill your family' very subtle.",1,3,5,26 August 2007
