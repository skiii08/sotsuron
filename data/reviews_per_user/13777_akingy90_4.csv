Black Swan," Wonderful...
","A young ballet dancer with the perfect personality to play the White Swan in Swan Lake but not the Black is forced to look deep inside herself to find her dark side in order to play both roles. A deeply disturbing film, with some genuinely scary moments, Black Swan fully deserves its recent awards and nominations.Natalie Portman gives an amazing, Oscar-winning performance as Nina, the dancer whose obsession with finding her inner Black Swan affects her physically and mentally. Elsewhere, Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey also impress.Highly recommended.",9,0,1,16 September 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Not bad, but not good.
","I was disappointed in this film. Admittedly, I expected great things from it, with its fantastic (and mostly British) cast, but there were a number of things that let it down for me.Firstly, the plot was complicated and hard to follow, and in my opinion some scenes could easily have been shortened or cut altogether. The flashbacks were also difficult to understand in places.Furthermore, it was unclear how and why the mole started working for the other side as well as his own. I also would have liked to have seen more of Smiley's train of thought as he figured out the identity of the spy, as there was no real way to make an educated guest as to which member of the circus it was.However, I wouldn't say that it was a bad film. It just wasn't the masterpiece I felt the writers and actors were capable of delivering.",6,13,25,27 September 2011
The Dark Knight," Stunning...
","I thought this was an amazing film, for so many reasons: The script was fantastic and very quotable, as proved by me and a friend who recently spent hours exchanging lines we could remember from the film. Most of these lines went to The Joker, but a number were from others, such as Harvey Dent, Alfred, Rachel Dawes and, of course, Batman/Bruce Wayne himself.The action scenes were also, of course, breathtaking throughout, from the opening scene at the bank (one of my favourites), through the epic chase in the tunnel to the scene in the skyscraper, high above Gotham.Then there was the superb acting from the entire cast. Standouts include Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal, while Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman also impress in their supporting roles.I was compelled to give Heath Ledger's performance an entire paragraph because it was that amazing. He made The Joker something more than evil: he made him insane. He stole every scene that he was in, and delivered some cracking lines. Finally, he fully deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and all the other awards that he won. It is a great shame that he's no longer with us.",9,1,3,27 September 2011
When Harry Met Sally...," A great chick flick!
","Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) meets Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) in 1977 when they need someone to share a drive with to New York after finishing college in Chicago. The film shows how, after a couple of false starts, they begin and develop a friendship, which stays constant throughout their turbulent romantic lives. However, the film raises the question, 'Can men and women ever be just friends?'.Personally, I loved this film. It's light-hearted and fun, the greatest laugh coming in the form of the famous 'orgasm scene' in a Manhattan deli. Crystal and Ryan both performed admirably, as did the supporting cast. I'll certainly watch this again.",8,1,1,29 September 2011
