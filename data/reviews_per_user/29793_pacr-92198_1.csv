Blade Runner 2049," Masterpiece
","This movie es more deep than the first one, its going to be a modern classic for sure. You just have to read the reviews from the first one saying its slow, boring, with scenes no sense, that they don't like something bla bla etc... so Blade Runner 2049 DID HIS JOB AND VERY GOOD.",10,9,21,13 October 2017
