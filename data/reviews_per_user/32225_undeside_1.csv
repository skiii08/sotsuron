The Ring," very well made film at last!
","This was a very well executed remake it took on its own visual style which was completely different from the Ringu series. It was atmospheric and quite chilling in its various scenes especially in one of the first scenes where the dead girl is shown in the cupboard all rotted. It is up there along with the Shining as a good horror film there are not many about for example 'cabin fever' this film was so bad it was hilarious but I think it was supposed to be though. if you haven't seen it rush out and rent borrow or buy it, it is well worth it just for the wee evil girl climbing out of a well and walking jitterly up to the TV screen then coming straight at you I also liked what lies beneath",10,1,2,26 March 2005
