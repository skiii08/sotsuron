Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It could've been a greater movie
","I love Star Wars not only because of the special effect, but also the story. It's one of the greatest story I've ever seen. And I would still have loved it even if they are set in 17 or 18 centuries with sword and ancient guns instead of light sabres and laser guns. The characters of Luke, Han Solo, Leia, and Darth Vader are so stunning and real. The trilogy are definitely life-time pictures. The idea of making a prequel, or tracing back to how Darth Vader comes to the Dark Side, is shivering and filling me with such a long-time longing. I think everyone is agree if I say that this movie should fully concentrate on the character of Anakin Skywalker. It would have been the greatest movie ever made.Unfortunately (a BIG ONE), it turns out flat. Almost dead flat. This Anakin doesn't convince me as a clever, hardworking, well-skilled, and ambitious boy. Instead, he's just a dreamy and spoiled little brat. I can't believe that he's building the pod-vehicle by himself (Or even C-3PO). This is just one thing.Another thing is that the dialogues are flat and lifeless. No wonder Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor seem heartless. If we compared with the first movie, 'A NEW HOPE',  there are real humans there. Luke is an ambitious but impatient boy, Han Solo is, sometimes, a mercenary jerk, and Leia is a spoiled princess. We can find them everywhere in real world.
So, I was GREATLY disappointed when I first saw the movie who got more of computer graphic characters than the human characters. I really really hope that the second and third episode are better than this.
Note : Does anybody ever consider to make the Anime Version of Star Wars? I would really love that.",Null,0,1,1 May 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Great visual does not necessary makes a great movie
","It certainly deserves the Oscars for best art direction, best original score and best cinematography. That's THREE Oscars, not four. (I think the best Foreign Language Film cannot be included). They are really doing a great job as those three factors are supporting each other. Good art direction makes good cinematography and they are sweetened by a good music arrangements. The trio are like old classical music, it's really indeed in the harmony.Unfortunately, they are heavily ruined by the most conventional plot ever made. It's like you're a big fan of pizza, and it looks very good with all the meat, the vegetables, the mushroom and the sauce. But when you finally taste it, the bread is awful and it ruins your appetite. That's what I felt when I first, second and three times, saw this movie. I cannot feel the emotion as it's supposed to be when I finally understand the story. It's because all characters talk like several heartless androids who pretend to be humans. The dialog scenes are just too lame, boring and uninteristing. Most people are astounded by the fighting scenes, but to me, it's too ordinary and unrealistic. There's one scene that bothers me a lot, when Michelle Yeoh acts like a true sister to the princess, but then suddenly she's furious at her without a strong motivation. If I hadn't known Ang Lee as a 'renowned' director, I would have thought it was a cheat to get them into fighting again.To summarize, it's an ordinary kung fu movie with great visualization.",Null,0,0,3 April 2001
The Green Mile," The best Stephen King's movie adaptation
","I'm a big fan of Stephen King, and had no idea at all that his installment novel, 'The Green Mile', would be made into a movie when I chose the book as the subject of my thesis for university graduation.I like the story a lot. But I'm always being skeptical to every movie who's adapted from a novel. So, I watched 'The Green Mile' with great fear, and when it finally ended, I was greatly relieved as it turned out to be what I had expected. Although there are some great scenes in the novel that's been taken away in the movie (it'll be longer if they were inserted, I know), I must say this is the best movie adaptation from Stephen King's book.
Many well-known reviewers in my country think it was too long. I have asked my friends (common people) who watched it and all of them don't think so. It should be that long, for if it had been a shorter movie, I would have hated it. (Tell me, which scenes that must be cut from the movie?)I might not be subjective about it, since I'm a great fan of Stephen King, but how many stories in the world that tell about the beauty in the death row prison, and how such pure and innocent beauty (symbolized by the mouse and John Coffey) is mixed up by the brutality and unimaginable violence (symbolized by Delacroix's execution and Wild Bill)? Frank Darabont might not the best director, but he succeeds in transforming the essence of the novel and displaying it perfectly into the big screen. I could immediately feel the sadness of John Coffey at the first time he appeared in the screen only by his expression. I could feel the pain of Delacroix's execution (the scene I fear most, in terms of not conducted properly) through his screaming. And most important thing, I could feel the magic.
The Green Mile is a great satisfaction and must be a perfect example of movie adaptation.",Null,1,2,11 April 2001
Princess Mononoke," A good Anime, but not too great.
","I think the sentence 'I've seen better, but not frequently' is appropriate for this Anime. Using the Forest Spirit as a massage is quite interesting, although I can't help feeling being lectured about keeping the forest green and its animal. The cinematography is quite excellent. I must say, symbolizing the 'bullet' as a root of evil which makes the giant animals possessed and become uncontrollable is a very interesting idea. They create a different world from us where evil is shown explicitly by worm-like creatures devouring the animal and are contagious to others like a disease.However, the character seems rather flat. Emotions such as fear, worriness, hatred are not quite well-displayed. (Or maybe it's because I only saw the English dubbed version). There are also too many massages delivered, making the movie too long and full of lectures. The climax is great, but the ending is just too fast and not touching enough as most of Animes do. Maybe it's because there too many characters involved.All in all, it's a good movie, but I've seen better.",Null,0,1,3 April 2001
