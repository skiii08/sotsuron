National Treasure: Book of Secrets," National Treasure: Book of Secrets: Nicolas Cage's unclassified disappointment
","It's a Gates' Family party, world-wide trip, and if you are very wise, you will skip this junket. Sequels are supposed to be a bridge between films, not worthless, empty, waste of time, and money, effortless grinders. This second film has more in common with a salt-water game fish, caught on a hook on the end of a line, before it jumps into vision because it flounders, just below the surface. The opening 20 minutes of this film, holds a great deal of excitement and promise but that falls flat, for a movie played for laughs, rather than intrigue and true detective work. This film lead the countries top box office take for two weeks running, only on the fame of National Treasure 1. There is nothing to get excited about, nor is there any anticipation of 'the chase!' as there was in the first film. Director Jon Turteltaub may take the blame for this really terrible film, only because he accepted the position as Director. The actors played their parts well enough but to make a great film, one has to have a great script. National Treasure 2 died from a lack of a good screenplay! If there is a National Treasure 3 sequel, hopefully those in Hollywood will put their combined heads together and write a great screenplay before anyone says, 'Action!'",2,8,16,11 January 2008
3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Yuma: take the last train to love for a gunslinger
","The year; 1868, the place; Bisbee, Arizona, the time; three years into the reconstruction era post Civil War: where life, living, and love is as savage as a mindless bullet coming out of the end of the barrel of a gun, pointed at you! Every man, woman, and child wears a scar, either visible or in their hearts from the ravages of the War between the States. Ben Wade (Russell Crow) is the man in black, the leader of a ruthless band of cutthroats but an existentialist just the same. As incongruous as this may seem Mr. Wade is a lover as well. Enter Dan Evans (Christian Bale) a down on his luck, poor dirt farmer, and with a wooden leg to boot, compliments of a Union Army Surgon after a battle with a Confederate Army Regiment. Evans and his family are literally standing on their last leg, no pun intended, when after Wade is captured and a reward is offered to transport the bandit to catch the 3:10 train to Yuma Prison. Evans volunteers for the job to save his farm and his family. Wade the 'lover' has this profound effect on most everyone he meets. Either it is hero worship or out and out physical desire, the pheromones of Wade's chemical makeup has the same effect whether you be male or female. Then the existentialist, Wade comes out to play. If Wade cannot have the individual to play with, no one can. I nominate for The Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor of 2007, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) who portrays Ben Wade's sadistic knife-edged sexually undefined Second Lieutenant. Prince brandishes a matched pair of 45. caliber Scofield break-action revolvers as Wade's side-kick and fellow roust-about. Directed by James Mangold and shot on location in New Mexico, the cinematography may well have paid homage to both John Ford and Robert Altman who directed McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Both of these 'giants' created and gave direction to actors, writers, directors, and others of the film industry whose debt was never expected to be repaid. Strange, how a 15 page, short, story, by an unknown copy boy by the name of Elmore Leonard, could influence Hollywood twice, over a span of 60 years and produce two separate and different examples of the western genre. The American Western, often copied, imitated, and mimicked, but never duplicated. The 3:10 to Yuma, best not to miss that train.",8,1,2,28 September 2007
Star Trek," Star Trek:Galaxy Quest of 2009
","Director J.J. Abrams has brought forth this years Science Fiction Comedy hit, of the year. There are more laughs per moment, just as in Galaxy Quest. The top Banana is Dr. Leonard 'Bones' Mc Coy, (Karl Urban) followed closely by his Second Banana, Scotty. (Simon Pagg) Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) also do very well, as the other comedy team, in this film. If you are a 'first season' Trekkie, then, the sight gags are even funnier. Because of the 'spoilers' rule, this reviewer cannot site, any examples. Hikaru Sulu, (John Cho) stands on his own 'chops', with his Samurai blade, in hand. The CGI , is excellent, as one would expect, in this 'early days' epic, but it does not make the film as stupendous, as it is. The large cast and crew, as shown in the 300 seconds of credits, bears, this out. If you have the slightest bit of Trekkie, in you, do not pass up this comedy, on the large screen.",9,1,7,19 May 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Hellboy Ii: The Golden Army: Satan's Son's Sequel Stumbles
","If you have not viewed the first Hellboy, all the better for you, when you do see, Hellboy II. Through a 'flashback' scene, at the beginning of this sequel, the audience is introduced to the now dead, Professor Trever 'Broom' Brutenholm. ( John Hurt) The setting is right out of an old, 'Father Knows Best,' early 1950's television sitcom. The silver screen brings forth, Director Guilleino del Toro's, 'Professor and Hellbrat!' A vision, of father and Hellpest, at home, where too much time is not left, on the cutting-room floor. Wait for the Director's Editon, when it comes out on DVD. Hellboy is supposed to be a larger than life character, but in Hellboy II, he is not. This is made painfully aware, to the audience, when our hero is standing next to his team mates. In the original Hellboy, 'Red' (Ron Perlman) is presented as a much, larger-than-life creature from the underworld! Where do you think, the name of the film, came from, for the screenplay! Hellboy's love interest is the very hot, in fact on fire, Liz Sherman(Selma Blair). Unfortunately there is not an ounce, of this once, very heated, relationship in this sequel. No passion, and the plot suffers! There is however, Abe Sapien, (Doug Jones) whose comic relief, as an aqua-breathing, Lothario, saves the film, from death by deadpan acting, and lack of any emotion at all. Even Tom Manning (Jeffery Tambor) as the acting, bumbling, chief, of the organization, whose job is 'to bump back at things, which go bump in the night', offers little in the way of humor. Where Hellboy II does shine, is the attention, which Mr. del Toro, spent on the creatures, 'who do go bump in the night'. The interaction of 'Red' and his crew in the action sequences, are quite good, but not enough to equal Hellboy I. Now some may say, that this production, is made to show 'Red's' more human side, if so, then Hellboy II, most certainly, stumbles, over his own feet, of red clay.",7,6,14,26 July 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Sweeney Todd:Burton and Depp together again, a cut above the rest
","'My one true friend!' as Sweeney Todd sings this line, leering into the mirror, viewing the reflection of himself, in the polished silver, straight edged, razer he holds tenderly in his hand, close to his demonic face, once again after 18 years of incarceration, a sardonic smile appears. The audience knows that blood will flow, and lives will be lost, in a revenge driven musical, based on the original play by Stephen Sondheim. Johnny Depp takes on the persona of the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, with such ease one would almost imagine he was not play acting at all. Joining Mr. Todd is the lovely (sic) Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who joins him in this lively but deadly, duet. Mr. Todd and Mrs. Lovett make a handsome couple, although their facial colors are a bit ashen, and the circles about their eyes are rather dark, non the less they seem quite appropriate, for working class folk in the mid-1800s, in London, England.This 'R' rated opera is lavishly funny, with ghoulish glimpses, of blood curdling buffoonery, and musical merriment, although, it is difficult to hear all of the wonderful lines, in the verses in the songs, while one is laughing, from the previous lines,while listening to the quick witted phrases currently being sung by our favorite, devilish duo. Mrs. Lovett runs a bakery, specializing in meat pies on Fleet Street. She allows Mr. Todd to use the room above her Estblisment to ply his close cutting trade. This gives rise to a fresh supply, and a new ingredient, for Mrs. Lovett's now fiendishly good meat pies, and an increase in business. Special notice must be given to the performances by, Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Ed Sanders. Be forewarned; this is not everyones tea cake. Sweeney Todd does get carried away while shaving some of his customers, too closely!",9,2,4,12 January 2008
Burn After Reading," Burn After Reading: Blurred after Seeing
","Another Coen Brothers comedy of who is screwing who? Maybe, but more to the point this is an example of a 90 minute string film, with a missing 30 minuets. Is this flick funny, yes, not as funny all the time, but very funny, at times. It is really a stoner film, disguised as a short FARGO. Too much information is given out without enough, ending plot. The film opens and closes with an aerial view of The Pentagon. Possibly to give an air of finality or complete misunderstanding. The story line is about how so many people, can enjoy being screwed, either from the vantage point of prey or predator. As with all Coen Brother films, this one is full of A-Star Power. Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) a philandering husband, Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) an exercise employee who is one of Clooney's bed mates. Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) a recently unemployed CIA agent who is married to Doctor Katie Cox (Tilda Swanton) who is also screwing Mr. Clooney. Then there is Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) who gets a real screwing by Mr. Clooney, completely by accident. There are many point of view shots in this film, that causes the audience to question, why? Is the audience supposed to view each point of view shot as a separate but very important point in the film, each time this scenario shows itself on screen? One must decide this question for oneself, or maybe just e-mail the Coen Brothers. Seeing the film as a screener, allowed this reviewer not to get screwed, by evening movie prices. My vision and my viewing pleasure of this film were both blurred, after seeing.",6,3,7,3 October 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story: Reflections of a rolling stone in a fun house mirror
","Walk Hard; The Dewey Cox Story; here in referred to as (WHTDCS) by this author is this years Forest Gump (1994). Concider, Forest Gump is mentally challenged, his best friend Bubba has a speech impediment, Lt. Dan is a double amputee, and his girl friend Jenny, dies of AIDS, all in the span of 30 years. The era is almost the same for both films as well as the violence, adult language, adult content, sexuality, drug use, political activism, rock and roll and racial equality issues. Granted Forest Gump was rated PG-13 and WHTDCS is rated R for male non-sexual frontal nudity, and a bit more funny, adult content but this film was made 13 years later, in actual time.The title WHTDCS, may be more offense to the American public but with a film titled Knocked Up (2007) the gloves are already off. Back to comparing both films; when the public watched Forest Gump, they laughed out loud but as previously stated, the main characters were mentally retarded, confined to a wheel chair, an alcoholic, suffering from a speech disorder, and dying of AIDS! Yet, the film viewing public more often than not found this film a comedy, is it not strange to laugh at those less fortunate than most! WHTDCS is very much like the cast in Forest Gump; Dewey Cox (John C. Rielly) has no sense of smell, his lead drummer is a drug addict as well as the rest of his band and Dewey is forced to leave home at the age of 16! Satire allows the audience to laugh at a sad situation like Forest Gump and WHTDCS. In the early 1960's Monte Python's Flying Circus hit the airways of Public Television in The USA, America had found a new comedy. It was great fun to laugh at The British! All of their silly walks, Spam, Spam, Spam, etc.,etc.,etc., but we were laughing at our English neighbors, not at ourselves. WHTDCS is grand satire at America, and Americans may find that too salty a meal to digest. Director Jake Kardan has made a very funny film, a pun unto itself, with actor John C. Reilly in the lead doing stand-up. Sadly the box office does not reflect the gross product of Dewey Cox, however hard, he may walk.",9,3,7,7 January 2008
Ratatouille," Ratatouille: a rat's tale too long!
","Normally I do not venture out to see animated films because I am usually disappointed. Ratatouille was a pleasant surprise for the first sixty minutes. Director Brad Bird who also wrote the screenplay weaves an excellent adult fantasy up until that point. Sadly this 110 minute film could have been cut to 87 and Ratatouille would have been far more digestible. This is a movie about life, food, and new found relationships all working together to keep the human and animal spirit evolving. The animation is excellent. Pixar does magical film work, especially on a large screen when 2D becomes 3D. The colors, the depth, and the pure movie magic is completely captivating. Too much seasoning can foul the taste of the broth, too much time spent on needless scenes, drags out this film. Parents, this is not a film for children because it is made for an adult audience. There are only bits and pieces of cute scenes that your small fry will truly understand or comprehend. The actors who dub the voices of the main characters do an excellent job. How can you go wrong with such luminaries as Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Peter O'Toole, and Janeane Garofalo. Where Ratatouille sours is that it tries to choke itself on it's own recipe.",5,6,19,4 July 2007
No Country for Old Men," No country for old men:Not enough Coen for any age.
","Where would there be a country for no old men? Logan's Run? The 1960's science fiction film based on the book of the same name where the main plot of the story is to voluntarily commit suicide by the age of 21. This might seem more plausible in one's own personal world of dreams. Herein lies the main fault with the latest Coen Brothers big screen extravaganza: No Country for Old Men. The tract of the film seems more like a personal dream by the Coen's and not a film script. Many groups of flickering images are presented before the eyes of the audience but there is little final transion to an outcome. Llewelyn Moss (JossBrolin) is one of the films heroes, pursed by a very psychotic killer called Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Llewelyn has stumbled into a very large drug deal, gone bad at the tale end. He grabs the money, like so many other Coen Brother plots and the chase begins. Unforturatly the pursuit is more like a Tom & Jerry cartoon. We meet many other characters who get in the way of the scramble, and just like in those Saturday morning cartoons, they die. Did I forget to mention the over narration by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones)? Mr. Jones does very well, as he does in most of his efforts, because he has practiced his trade down to a fine art. Sheriff Ed is almost a re-creation of the role Mr. Jones played in Men in Black, and just as sarcastic. The Coen's undertaking is quite funny all the way to it's final flicker. Next time the Brother's Coen could use a bit more adhesive, less nightmare, and men of any age.",5,8,17,16 November 2007
Gran Torino," Gran Torino:Mr. Eastwood's last laugh
","Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) has just buried his wife, ended his long term marriage, and begins what appears to be, a lonely life, until he, is lowered into the ground. At least that is what Mr. Kowalski, thinks how he will live out the rest of his days. Nothing could be further from reality, for Walt. When an Oriental family takes ownership of the house next door, Walt's life begins anew. To say that Mr. Kowalski, is set in his own ways, is to admit the obvious. A Korean War Veteran, this proud American, does not adapt to change very well, at all. This single factor, adapting, is the glue, which pulls this very funny film, together. The trailers, paint a very different image, for the movie viewing public. The trailers, make Mr. Kowalski out to be a very rude, violent, and closed individual. 90 percent of Gran Torino is a comedy. The jokes are all about humans and how to change and get along, no matter how different people are, on the outside. Mr. Eastwood, directed this coming of age film and how all of the characters in the film, no matter how old they are, can change. Sue Lor (Ahney Her) first approaches Mr. Kowalski, as one of his new neighbors, from the family next door. Sue, learns about Walt's loss of his wife, and shares similar feelings because she too, has just lost a loved one. Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) the younger brother of Sue, is the focal point, of the film, because of the relationship which he develops with Walt. The Grand Torino, is a beautiful car, owned by Walt, when he worked on the line, at Ford Motor Company. The car also has a history but it is better that the film viewers, find that out for themselves. To comfort Walt, is the role of Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) but in time, the priest and the widower learn to stand tall. As I said earlier, everyone in this film, learns, how to change. This is a period film and the attention that is paid to the era from whence it comes, stays true. Maybe we all should take a drive in the Gran Torino, and change.",8,0,1,15 January 2009
The Dark Knight," Batman:The Dark Knight: Bruce Wayne: Come out into the Light
","The Dark Knight pays homage to the Michael Keaton:Batman. A very dark venture into the twisted psychology's of the main characters. The Joker, (Heath Ledger) Harvey Dent, (Aaron Eckhart) and of course, Bruce Wayne, (Christian Bale) are all men whose souls have one thing in common; the desire to be perfect. This of course is impossible, because, being human makes one fallible. The trait, these three males also share, is the lack of the fear, of death. Unfortunately, this flick, spends too much time, dealing out, the death card. The Joker's personal card, is a playing card, with a joker, on the face. While the film is quite intense, there is too much murder, a foot, with little bloodshed. The rating of The Dark Knight is PG- 13, it may in fact, have been better served, with an R. The rating of any film, decides the audience, who can view said flicker, but in today's movie market, top box office billing is the driving force. The Dark Knight, is not intended for children, under 12 years of age. The question of reality verses fiction, in the mind of the young, is a defining factor, when trying to resolve this film, in the young mind. Listening to a conversation between two boys after viewing the film, brings out this question. 'The Joker is a genius!' said one lad. I said, 'The Joker, was a genius.' The two boys said nothing in return, and walked away. So much for the understanding, of a film, intended for adults, by two youths. The fact, that the passing of Mr. Ledger, and his role, as The Joker, may be too much for children, to comprehend. Commissionair Gordon, (Gary Oldman) is the true hero, of The Dark Knight. He is portrayed as a man, with very, deep, family values. This quality, plants his feet firmly on the ground, and not with the death defying aspects of The Joker, Harvey Dent, or Bruce Wayne. When Gordon comes home, from a murderous night in Gothem, he is not alone. This factor separates him, from the rest of the main cast. The audience knows, that all of the rest of the main leads, are alone. The other problem with The Dark Knight, is the fact, that it is a sequel. When The Dark Knight, rides off alone, at the conclusion of the this film, the audience is not sure, what direction, this franchise will follow. With so many dying, the question is, who is left for a third?",7,1,8,1 August 2008
Avatar," Avatar: Cameron's Comic Flicker
","With great expectations, my guest and I laid down $20.00 for a matinée, to view the greatest 3D film ever to be shown on the silver screen! Three fourths of the way through, I was still looking for that film. To be more precise, I felt as though I had gone through a time machine, to my youth in the 1950's on a Saturday afternoon, watching 35 cartoons and two 3D science fiction films. Avatar was the same old Cowboys and Indians all over again but in reverse. On the planet Pandora, humans are seeking the path to unlimited power at the cost of the indigenous population. The name of the planet, Pandora, should give the audience a clue, that maybe this is a box better left closed. The citizens of Pandora live in harmony with each other and their entire planet. The humans, who want to study the Na'vi, incubate Avatars in which they can join psychologically and mingle with the general population. The company the scientists work for are a paramilitary organization who will stop at nothing to obtain their goal. So we have the Na'vi on one side and the paramilitary on the other side, who do you think will win? Does the name of the film give you the slightest hint? I thought so. James Cameron who wrote and directed this 3D film to end all 3D films should have stopped at 120 minutes and left the other 40 for his director's cut.",6,3,7,26 December 2009
Stranger Than Fiction," Stranger Than Fiction: Apples To Apple Sauce
","Harold Crick's life is so orderly that whatever he does has white over-lays like blue prints that only the audience and he can see. He also says he hears a woman's voice telling him what to do with his life! What is so strange about a man hearing voices? What is most peculiar is having a Timex wrist watch that thinks for itself and it's owner! Unfortunately the wrist watch never gets enough personality to gain status as a main character. Rene' Magritte's paintings of the black suited men with Granny Smith Apples for faces and Black Derby hats would fit well as the character portrayed by Will Farrrell. Mr. Farrell is seen many times walking the streets of the 'Windy City' holding a large Granny Smith Apple between his teeth and accomplishing little else. Throughout the film the reference between Harold Crick and the apple becomes very apparent. The voice in his head are the written words of the novelist Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who is trying to slay her main character, Mr. Crick, but at the moment has an unfortunate case of writer's block. Toward the close of the film Ms. Eiffel who is a life observer instead of using a muse, watches a stray Granny Smith Apple roll off a fruit display onto the street and this is the vision for the end of Harold Crick. Ms. Eiffel completes her novel but has a change of heart because Harold has had a total life transmogrification. This film like a good Granny Smith Apple lacks the sharp snap like sound when you bite into said fruit instead all you get is the squish of apple sauce.",6,2,5,10 November 2006
The Good Shepherd," The Good Sheperd: Keeps the Wolf from the Door.
","Men like Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) select a path of life set apart from society, so those living in the fold of our free system can do so, completely unaware of the man who holds the Sheperd's crook. Edward is a true patriot. The safety of the United States and it's citizens are in his hands. The elements of The Good Shepard are the life experiences of Edward and how after accepting a commission from U. S. Army Intelligence on the day of his nuptials, separates the young couple for the next six years. The bespectacled face of Edward Wilson hides the stone cold calculating heart of a man who knows he will come home from the war. He returns to a wife who does not love him and a five year old son who does not know him. The C.I.A. is the perfect government agency for Edward to continue his protecting of the flock. The sequencing of the film, is in itself a story about many secrets and who can be trusted with these secrets. Edward's right hand man Ray Bucco (John Tuturro) throughout the entire film gives a stunning performance well worth a nod for a recommendation for a Best Supporting Oscar. As The Good Shepard draws towards a close, the audience remembers that this was a period piece from the late 1920's through the mid 1960's and as Edward disappears into C.I.A. Headquarters one can only think of the next bespectacled Sheperd taking his place.",9,28,52,20 December 2006
Iron Man," Iron Man:needs tinkering
","Tony Stark, aka Ironman, is the hero of 2008. Or better stated, Robert Downey Jr. is Carrot Top, doing stand-up, in the comedy film classic of this summer. Mr. Downey takes off with an array of one liners, and simply does not quit. Along with his stand-up comedy, the sight gags add more support, to this burlesque, portrayed on screen. Without giving away too much of the plot of the film, a head strong Industrialist, goes into the thick of the current battle zone, to show off his most current weapon of defense, and blunders into the hands of the enemy. Ironman is born, and the film goes on, full tilt from there. Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is one of the key board members of Stark Industries, and best friend of Tony Stark's late father. What is most interesting about the choice of Mr. Bridges in this film, is his past film credit, Tron (1982). A lot of the visual electronics, in Ironman, appear to pay tribute, to the early, light show effects, that were created for the film, Tron. Mr. Bridges may play his part a bit over the top, but that goes very well, with his outrageous ego and persona. Pepper Everhart (Gwyneth Paltrow) plays Tony Stark's quick witted, and almost sarcastic, first secretary. In fact, she is his only secretary, and true confidant. Their relationship aids the only true love element in the entire film, which brings a human quality, necessary to bring the script down to earth. Tony' s and Pepper's rapport leads straight into the basis of the material, which supports the real issues of the Ironman myth. The real story of Ironman is taken from the true-love lives of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley. Ironman is Frankenstein, reborn to suit the failed self-image of a man. Whenever man tries to create something greater than his own self-image, a monster is created. No one but the creator, sees the creation for what it is intended, all others see, is a monster! Remember, this is a comedy, so laugh with Ironman, and tighten a few bolts, along the way.",9,1,2,27 May 2008
300," 300:comic book characters in codpieces
","If slashing, gashing, and stabbing, and blood flying everywhere is the film genre you enjoy then Frank Miller's latest graphic novel brought to the silver screen is a must see for you. 90 minuets of the entire 117 minuets are devoted to the art of maiming, gouging, and inflicting as much pain as possible to your opponent in each battle scene. The film is very loosely based on the historical battle of 300 Spartans verses the Persians. Almost entirely shot on green screen, the film is a piece of art in itself. More like a giant comic book laid out before the audience, each frame escapes it's own borders into the next. Mr. Miller has far surpassed his work in SIN CITY. 300 has depth, perspective, and almost a 3D quality. I viewed this film in a regular theater, I can only imagine what the effect would be on an IMAX screen. Unfortunately, the film caves in on itself. I did not know that Spartan's spoke with a heavy Scottish accent. There are so many inside jokes told by the Spartans that because of their accent and the excellent FX sound quality, the audience misses most of the one-liners. The film moves very slowly and after the third volley of Persian arrows which blacken the sky, it seemed as though 300 was running out of plot. Viewing this film as a 'screener' meant that I did not have to dip into my wallet at all. Hopefully Mr. Miller's next film will have more plot instead of spectacle and gore.",5,11,22,7 March 2007
