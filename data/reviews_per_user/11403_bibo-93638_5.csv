First Man," Another la la land, in space, on earth and in between
","'First man' is a feast for the eyes, the ears and the senses. It is a love story between man and space, man and the moon, man and grief, man and other humans, and man and earth. A continuous dance and twirls between trials and errors, incidents, accidents, false alarms and right ones. Go and watch it for the thrills, the sensations, the music, the directing, the sound editing and the subtle performances.. a 'ride out of this world' in the true sense of the word.",9,0,1,21 October 2018
Moana," A journey of discovery unlike any other
","After 'Frozen', comes a 'summer-like' Disney movie that is unlike any other animated movie you have seen. From the 'extremely' real sensation and color of the water, to the uplifting songs and breath-taking animation, the movie is a real ocean ride that never loses steam. Multi-layered throughout as it deals with concepts of 'community', 'roots', 'exploration' and 'faulty-parental guidance' Even the characters sound real given an exceptionally smart script that makes you forget at some point that you are watching an animation, thanks to a fast paced and meticulous plot that has more than one surprise embedded in it. Truly a must see in every sense of the word.",9,3,15,22 December 2016
Lion," A movie with a soul of its own
","To put it in simple words, 'Lion' is a journey that grabs you entirely ; whether you want it or not, you are a part of each and every scene. Exactly like the hero, you find yourself having visions of a past that you think you have forgotten, you long for something more and you dig for something deeper. This is a journey back home, filled with emotions, hard decisions, and an infinite willingness to reach somewhere safe.. Simple story, dream like sequences and real characters that are aware that 'there are no white pages' but that in a way, there is always a black ink somewhere that you can use to finish the endless books that you have in your head. A gem and must see. Highly recommended for the cast's performances, the musical score and the emotional layer that refuses to let you go even after the movie had ended.",9,119,161,15 December 2016
La La Land," Not for everyone. Great musical score. A movie with movement and a beating heart
","Not a movie for everyone that is for sure. However, having already seen Whisplash' I had a very good feeling about that movie, not to mention that the entire cast was already promising. But the direction is what I was mostly looking for. And as it turned out: this is yet another masterpiece at least for the distinguished crowd and the ppl who are looking for something light but meaningful, romantic but real to the core. Actually the first scene is more than enough and is a great 'opening' that is as impressive as the many other visual scenes that would follow. And between all the music, the swift and sophisticated moves, the tap dancing, the colors, the smiles and the stages, you end up noticing the moments of silence, the moments of truth..this tiny instant between two records, or notes when everything seems to be some kind of a distant vision, a 'trip' to a future that could have been but that won't necessarily happen..One vision out of many others, one possibility out of a multitude; Never going with one perspective but covering all of them..Hers, His..and theirs together. Definitely a must see for the experience of seeing something unique for once, cheesy at times, but a different kind of cheesy nonetheless, albeit the good and refined kind.",9,3,7,5 January 2017
Arrival," Not your traditional sci-fi..but definitely worth your time (minor spoilers)
","This is not your regular science fiction movie, that is for sure. aliens are coming in 12 locations, nations are scared, alarmed and eager to know the 'purpose of these beings' while being highly skeptical of 'destructive motives' which is more or less an instinctive reaction to something that we don't understand. And then, in a very smooth and unexpected transition, comes the notion of language, time, how they are related and how we interpret things and act based on our perceptions, motives, understanding etc..We are usually used to look at the 'shape of things' or at 'first layers' and this is exactly what the movie is telling us not to. Aliens, foreigners, 'different beings' is only the first layer of a very complex and humane message (that I do not want to spoil for you). This is a movie for people who dig for layers, enjoy cult-like imagery, and do not mind thinking about the movie and its message long after the final credits. Highly recommended, great performance for Amy adamsvand another great success for the director of 'Sicario'.",10,1,6,26 November 2016
