United 93," It is a sickening movie to watch.
","It took a long time before I was able to see this movie. Hollywood does not have a good reputation when it comes to films about real events. But I was surprised to see that the events where depicted in a clean way. No superheroes running around in this movie, no over-the-top heroism. Yet, it is a bit awkward to see people, like Ben Sliney, play themselves. It is a sickening movie to watch, because the outcome is known. Four terrorists hi-jack a plane, kill the pilots and head for the Capitol building to destroy. The passengers panic but on the airline mobile phone service they find out that already planes hit the WTC and the Pentagon. So they decide to regain control over the plane. Although they manage to take out 2 of the terrorist their action is too late, the terrorist at the control lets the plane crash. Most of the events are filmed with a hand-held camera so the movie effectively takes you into the cramped space of an air liner. The movie is sickening because you know the passengers are not going to succeed. The movie is also sickening because you look at people, the terrorists, who believe that their god will give them access to heaven because they murder people. These terrorists seem like intelligent people, so they should know the difference between believing something or knowing something. Yet, they behave as if they have no doubt about murder. That their god orders them to do that. But it is just something they believe. Did they never ask themselves the question, what happens after death? Do we go to heaven and will our god say, ah, you did a good thing. Or will he say, oh, you are the ones that murdered these people, but your victims are already here in heaven. I can't allow you to mingle with them so you won't come into my heaven. Go next door, to hell. Anyone who knows the difference between believe and knowledge, would have thoughts like that. They didn't. Who did that to them, who brainwashed their minds so much that they chose to die. Whoever, it must be an evil person, probably someone who would never do that himself. Someone who defends the comforts of his life here on earth, who whispers the promises of death in the minds of numskull to retaliate on his enemies. It is a sickening movie to watch.",8,0,0,11 November 2015
Fury," Good movie, but it deserves a better ending
","Fury is a good movie, but not particularly realistic. The experiences of Norman Ellison show very well how the ethics of people degrade in battle. Towards the end realism fades, however. The enemy army unit is loudly singing in a war zone, making it obvious that they will be spotted. Although nearby, it takes ages for the Germans to reach the Americans. A gimmick that seems to be copied from Inglorious Bastards - it worked there, but not here. The Germans carry anti-tank weaponry, but do not use it. Enemy fire sometimes entirely stops because of a dramatic scene taking place in the tank. The enemy behaves like brainless characters in a video game, going back and forth depending on the events taking place. A sniper in camouflage suddenly appears when needed. After the battle, dead Germans are scattered all around, like matches dropped from a box, but for unknown reasons they do not cover the road. If the director would have restricted himself to a small unit of the enemy with only limited weaponry, it would have improved the realism of the final scene. But don't get me wrong, the movie was good. I gave it 8 out of 10 points.",8,3,6,3 January 2015
Little Boy," Melodramatic
","This film is well made. It is a Disney-like story about an American family torn apart by the second world war. And the film also shows the position the Japanese Americans were in during WWII. Yet it is rather melodramatic, it contains all the necessary elements, like - you can achieve anything if you have Faith, crying boys, the daddy-daddy scene, and all is well that ends well. Unfortunately the title is not a surprise, and it is only waiting for that card to be played. I liked the film during watching, there is not a moment of slackening, however in retrospect the film did only have a few surprises, so it doesn't grip you like it should. All in all, good, but only barely.",6,5,7,29 August 2015
About Time," Why do people like this film?
","Why do people like this film? It's a romantic comedy without a plot. The story-line is simple. Man decides to find a girlfriend, finds one, they marry, have three children, father of the man dies. End of movie. Of course that is not enough to fill a movie, so the director added a twist. The father of the man told him, when he turned 21, that the men of the family are able to travel back in time. All they have to do is to step in a dark secluded space, think of the memory they want to go back to and clench their fist, and voil√†! Nice idea to fill the rest of the movie. Unfortunately their are so many flaws in the story, it got annoying to me. It's a nice idea to travel back a few minutes, maybe a day, to redo something that could have been better, but sometimes the steps are major, and at some point the man finds out that his first child is now a son instead of daughter. His father explains him he can't go back before the conception because if he changes the past just a tiny bit, out comes a different child. Nevertheless, unexplained is how he manages to get his daughter back. Another thing, he can travel back in time, but not forward. So he has to relive his live with his changed past. If this is only a few minutes it is quite all right, and there is a funny scene in the movie where there has been taken advantage of that. But to prevent that the movie will get boring by showing the reliving, the director just skips to the present again. So it looks like he travels forward in time as well, but he doesn't. You have to realize that for the major flaw in the end of the movie. The man travels back to the moment his father is still alive, and the father decides to have a father-son moment so he travels some 20 years further back with his son to skip pebbles on the sea. (That is before the moment of conception of his three children!) So now the son, a little boy, has to relive his entire life, remembering all the changes he made to his past to get where he was some 20 years later. But the father will only tell him that he can travel in time when he will be 21. So by then he will probably have forgotten all his changes... However, the end of the movie shows he still managed to redo them all. This simple romantic comedy has no plot, the time-traveling part is infested with flaws. So, why do people like this film?",6,0,5,27 December 2015
Warrior," One dimensional
","I know 3D does not really take of, but does a movie have to be as one dimensional as this one? The moment the viewers were told the two brothers were going to fight in the same tournament, the outcome was foreseeable. I must admit that the sweat, the blood, the atrocity was all filmed very impressively, also thanks to the sound design, but the story is really very, very shallow. The good brother versus the bad brother. The wife opposing the fight, but turning like a leaf. The school principal opposing the fight, but turning like a leaf. The outsider, bound to win. The uncongenial favorite, who doesn't stand a chance against the hero. The no-good father, but still a rough diamond. The American fairy tale that, no matter how violent, the hero deserves our sympathy. I could go on, however, the only scene I anticipated, but to my surprise was not there, is the famous daddy-daddy scene; you know, the scene where the children run over a fresh green field to their victorious father, crying out 'Daddy, daddy!' So, all in all, it could even have been worse...",3,11,25,22 January 2012
Cross of Iron," This movie had it's day
","Sam Peckinpah was known for the display of violence in his movies, but since then directors like Tarentino set the new standard. So what worked in the 70s does not necessarily work now. What remains is a movie to be judged on its message and on its acting.The movie is about the personal fight between a 'rusty' soldier and an upper class officer. The soldier does the fighting, the officer is only there to get his decoration, because he can't bear the humiliation to go back to his entourage in Germany without one. This collision between interests is the theme of this movie. It is an interesting theme but the movie is only partly able to display it. The story is fragmented, some events hardly fit into the movie. The end is very sudden, it seems no one knew how to finish the movie, or maybe the budget was gone. Anyway, it seems rushed. But that is not the biggest problem. Acting is. Good acting should make you forget you are looking at an actor. Instead the actor must be able to make you believe you are looking at the character he plays. High ranking stars James Coburn, Maximillian Schell and James Mason were chosen for principal parts. James Coburn is not really an actor, he is only able to show his face and it depends on the movie whether you accept him in his role. In this entire movie he remains an out of place James Coburn. James Mason is a good actor but profoundly British and his part is to small to see him as the German he is playing. Schell is the only one who is able to make you forget he is a star, and merges with his character in this story. So the movie fails primarily on the acting and secondly on the flow of the story. This movie seems to be out of date, maybe it was good in its time but it misses the extra to still be attractive. That is too bad because the theme is interesting.",5,3,7,11 August 2014
The Illusionist," Too far fetched
","The Illusionist is, like The Prestige, a movie about conjurers. These movies were made around the same time and both play around the turn of the 20th century. Where The Prestige succeeds, though, The Illusionist fails. In general, a script describes a series of events that should result in an exciting storyline with possibly an unexpected plot twist, so the moment you think the story is going to unfold itself in a certain direction, it suddenly turns and heads into another direction. That worked in The Prestige, it doesn't work in this movie. The twist was too far fetched. The scene where it all went wrong for me was the moment Inspector Uhl went back to the stable to look for additional evidence. The apparent fact that the scene of the crime was still untouched after all this time overstretched my willingness to believe in this script. Like beads on a broken necklace the remaining scenes of the movie lost all coherency. Also, the fact that the movie in the end needed a visualized thought-process to explain what we should have understood what happened all along, was too silly for words. And last but not least, the idea that 'the bad people lived happily ever after' is not a good premise for a movie in this category. Still, I gave it 5 out of 10 for the way they visualized the old city of Vienna of those days.",5,1,2,25 February 2013
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," No more than a melodrama
","A melodrama cramped in too little time, that is what I felt after watching this movie. At first I thought, I should not be so stern, because this is just a children's movie, but during the cause of the movie very strong emotions are displayed, too strong for youth to digest. This is all in all an adult movie, and adult criteria apply. I will not reveal the plot but it is simply too much to believe in. I think the director should have taken out a lot of sidelines, because they are eating away valuable time. Now it seems the story is just tautened between the start and the end. For instance, the details about the sister could go, the teacher is not necessary, the time spent on the grandparents is a waste, the mini plot around lieutenant Kotler is rather superfluous. Instead this time could have been used to make the main plot meander more naturally to its unraveling. Without all these sidelines the solitude of the boy would increase, and the director could have thought about a more acceptable way the boy enters the no-go area. But like it is now, it is just a melodrama.",6,0,2,13 February 2014
Blood Diamond," It puts your nose in the muck all the way
","I just looked at Blood Diamond. This is really depressing. What is going on in this world? How could I go to a jeweler's store to buy a wedding ring for my loved one, when I think of this movie? Okay, I can hear you say, it is just a movie. Right, it's not a documentary; what happened here didn't really happen. But we see it in the news everyday. Things like this happen. It may be diamonds, it may be oil, it may be gold or it may even be wood. We know it happens, and we unwillingly take part in it. And we get numb. I looked at news footage like this so much, it sometimes changed my perspective. The other day, the news showed a clip of so called freedom fighters, ripping of the clothes of a young woman, throwing her down, in the street, naked. She fell on her knees, and there the clip halted. And my first thought was, she looks nice, immediately followed by the thought, she must have hurt herself. And after that, only then I thought, she may not be alive in a couple of seconds. What kind of world is this, to make thoughts put in this order? This movie shows it all. Of course it's a movie, so it has to be entertaining too, but it puts your nose in the muck all the way. Leonardo DiCaprio is a good actor, it shows. He had a hard time to find his way up again, but he did. Djimon Hounsou, Kagiso Kuypers and Benu Mabhena play very credibly a family that gets ripped apart in this war. Jennifer Connelly, as the journalist, is less convincing but don't worry, it doesn't break the movie. All in all this is a very good movie, and, I think, worth an Oscar.",8,0,0,28 October 2007
Casino," Looking back
","I saw this movie 20 years after its initial release. Yes, I know, that is late. But it gave me the opportunity to look at it from a perspective where movie styles have changed. Did it stand the test of time? It is safe to say that this movie more or less concluded the typical mafia movie era, movies with overactive swearing gangster-types, Italian lingo, violence, extortion, addiction. I must say, watching this film gave me the feeling that I had seen it all before. This is a template movie, a template for the style, a template for the characters, a template for the violence, templates for practically everything. As a result everybody is behaving one-dimensional, behaving as expected, no character development. Joe Pesci is really a caricature of himself, Robert De Niro is flat. Sharon Stone her part is at times interesting to watch. All in all, this movie gets 6 out of 10 from me, mainly because the pace is okay.",6,3,6,27 August 2017
Fast Five," Glorifying murder?
","The amount of plot holes in this movie make it difficult to classify it as an action movie. Much has been written here about the absurdity of the script. Just to give one extra example: sneaking into a police station to examine a safe by blowing up the men's room and breaking a man size hole in the wall, and still letting your audience believe it went unnoticed; it is to silly for words. So, I tried to look at it as a comedy, but it didn't fit either. The only objection I want to add to the list is the way Luke Hobbs shoots a defenceless man begging for help, even though he is the bad guy in this movie. I know, it's the American fairytale, the good guys shoot the bad guys and everybody lives happily ever after, but this is the glorification of brutal murder. You can't do that, not even in silly movies like this.",3,0,2,22 June 2013
