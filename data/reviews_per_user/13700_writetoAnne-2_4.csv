Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borderline Inappropriate? No. VERY inappropriate! :)
","This movie was so good. I laughed so hard, I cried. I typically like movies that step over the 'safe' line. Movies that push the envelope slightly. Especially comedies that do this. This movie LEAPED over the line. This movie RIPPED the envelope in half. It was so refreshing to see a movie that took a lot of risks and still ended up being one of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen in my life (although there were parts I had to close my eyes...and then I opened them and had to close them again....) The concept of the movie was great, but the execution was phenomenal. This will be one of those few movies that I will watch 100 times. There are SO many good lines. I must know them all! GO SEE IT!",10,2,14,4 November 2006
Spider-Man 3," Most Comical Spidey Installment
","I saw it at 12:01 am on Friday, May 4th.Since the movie started at midnight, I was afraid I would get sleepy during the movie. But I didn't. I loved it so much. I was laughing or on the edge of my seat wide eyed during the majority of the film. This installment of Spider-man is plenty comical and action-packed.There were a few things about it that I didn't like. But overall I enjoyed watching the movie so much I still gave it a 10/10 on IMDb.***The rest of this bulletin may contain spoilers*** The two things I didn't like: The cheesiness that is Mary Jane and Peter Parker in love. But, this is the Spider-man movies after all, so I was expecting it. Luckily the film redeemed itself with lots of great action sequences.They do not explain how Sandman comes into existence. They show this scene and you just have to accept it. 'Okay, some scientists were experimenting with the molecular decomposition of sand and this guy just happen to fall in and get turned into a super-villain.' And then they never go back and even attempt to offer anything.If you can accept this and a couple other minor logistical problems (like the exact same kind of goblin bombs causing drastically different results) , then you will enjoy this movie.Things that I really liked: The comical scenes were Peter Parker brushes his hair forward into an 'emo' style and tries to act bad-ass. Hilarious.The action, as I mentioned several times before. The only thing is sometimes it gets too fast to follow.I liked that he didn't get down on two knees at the end of the film. That would have been so cheesy!!!",10,15,26,5 May 2007
World Trade Center," I wanted to get up and leave...
","One of the worst piece of crap movies I have ever seen. Not only is it politically biased propaganda, it's BOOORRRRRIINNNNGGGGG. I only went to see it because my boyfriend wanted to see it. Watching this movie is almost like watching news in the days post 9/11. They use TONS of new footage. You know what? I've seen all this before. Half the movie is news footage and the other half is corny corny corny and slow and boring and lame. I used to have a lot of respect for Maggie GyllenhalL before I saw her in this terrible film. It's way toO early for a movie about 9/11. It's basically a profit off of a tragedy and not even entertaining at that. I had a sick feeling in my gut during the whole movie because I felt that it was wrong to be there. And then the movie was so awful I wanted to sleep.IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE: DON'T BOTHER.",1,11,21,25 September 2006
Happy Feet," Fun for the whole family! (If everyone is under 10)
","This movie is fun for the whole family! That is, if everyone in your family is under 10 years old. I gave this film a 3/10 because it did make me laugh a few times. The overly-stereotyped little 'mexican' penguins were the only good part of this movie. I especially liked the scene were they mock the leopard seal.Mumble is cute when he's baby Mumble. But, when Mumble grows up, he is no longer cute. He's awkward looking. I did not like the way he was animated throughout the film after his fluffy baby stage.I did like some of the animation, though. Like the leopard seal, for instance. I think they did a good job on the way the ice looked, the water, the birds. The lighting was beautiful. The penguins themselves were kind of strange, however. But why did they make the female penguins have 'breasts' and hour-glass figures? I found that kind of odd.I don't see any reason for anyone over 10 to really enjoy this film. But at the same time this movie is so long, I don't seen anyone under 10 sitting through the entire thing. Towards the end of the film, it gets really WEIRD. Who knew emperor penguins were strict Catholics that banned dancing and told other penguins they had to be 'devout' and they had to 'repent' for their sins? It started getting really creepy...Also, all the scenes with the humans were REALLY odd. Especially the end sequence. What the hell? I would not recommend this film to anyone my age. However, I can see why kids would enjoy the visual stimulation, even if they don't catch on to the stereotypes and creepiness factor.",1,0,0,28 March 2007
