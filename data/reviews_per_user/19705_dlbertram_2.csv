A Star Is Born," A beautiful film succeeds...
","Beautiful acting, performing, directing, editing. I didnt like a single song but could see the beauty in them all. It does require your full attention for the full effect (very difficult for some these days, as evinced by the other reviews here.)The story is updated - a contemporary view of a life destroyed by pain and drugs and/or alcohol. The love story and rise and fall and more are just the vehicles. It is so successful that I think that's why its loved AND hated. Alcoholics hate seeing the truth and consequences of their actions.",8,0,2,27 October 2019
