Scarface," What Would Have Happened If Tony Didn't Die?
","Do you suppose that if Tony Montana (Al Pacino) had survived the shootout at the end, he might have gotten back together with Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer) and had two children with her?I'm thinking this because I recently saw a photo of Pacino and Pfeiffer in People magazine celebrating the 20th anniversary DVD of 'Scarface'.  How ironic that they reunited in 1991's 'Frankie & Johnny'.
This is the premise.  Tony and Elvira still live in their Miami mansion with their two children, and they have a TV show based on their lives, ala 'The Osbournes'.  Their son wants to be a record producer and their daughter wants to be a singer.  However, their father's reputation as a drug dealer and their mother's efforts to get him out of the business stand in their way.  Sure, the Osbournes would probably sue them for copyright infringement, but the number of times they use the F-word on 'The Montanas' would probably make the Osbournes blush!'Scarface' is not a movie for everyone, but 20 years later, it's regarded as a classic 80s film.Rating:  ***",Null,0,1,2 October 2003
Catch Me If You Can," Clever caper movie
","Once again, Steven Spielberg applies his magic touch to a story about an average guy next door who happened to be one of the most infamous people of his time.  Tom Hanks is great as usual, but Leonardo DiCaprio steals the film.  I suspect the movie's title not only refers as to whether Hanks will arrest DiCaprio or not, but as to how these two can trust each other in the end, what with all the lies they tell to outdo themselves.Highly recommended.",Null,0,1,18 January 2003
Minority Report," Visually Stunning
","Minority Report has some of the best special and visual effects I've seen in any movie.  It's refreshing to see Max Von Sydow on the big screen again. (What was the last movie he did?)  With all the murders going on in the world today, it would be nice if we had the kind of technology they did in the movie and could catch the murderer before he/she struck.  It's too bad that in the movie the whole program turns out to be a big joke.Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report, I believe, were originally supposed to be directed by the late Stanley Kubrick.  Steven Spielberg has directed both these movies very well, but if Kubrick had taken a pass on that bomb Eyes Wide Shut and did those two instead, it would have been a great way to finish his short but great career.",Null,0,0,14 June 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Anyone who doesn't like this movie can walk the plank!
","'Pirates of The Caribbean' is one of the best big-screen blockbusters of the summer.  There's lots of action from start to finish, and the movie is helped by great performances from a mostly British cast (with the exception of Johnny Depp).  It's actually everything that Steven Spielberg's 'Hook' should have been, but wasn't.  After seeing this movie, you will probably never look at the ride at Disneyland in the same way again!",Null,0,0,28 July 2003
Blade," Got Blood?
","Blade may have started out in the comic books as a minor character in the Spider Man series, but he's the star of the show here!  Be warned, this is not a comic book movie for children.Wesley Snipes is great in the title role, and Stephen Dorff is also good as the lead bad guy (though we can't be sure that Blade himself is really a good guy), but the real stars of this movie are the brilliantly-choreographed fight scenes and the eye-popping (though yucky) special effects.Rating:  **1/2",Null,0,1,16 October 2003
Brokeback Mountain," Overrated
","While I think 'Brokeback Mountain' was well-acted and directed, it's probably one of the most over-hyped movies of 2005. The subject matter could have been handled in a more delicate manner. For example, the opening sex scene in the tent between Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhaal could have been displayed with a shot of the tent exterior and the camera slowly drawing back from the tent while the audience hears the sounds of sex coming from inside the tent. Today, however, Hollywood feels that everything involving a sexual and violent nature must be displayed graphically.I cannot feel any sympathy for Ledger's character. Not only does he feel it is appropriate for him and Gylenhaal to publicly display their homosexuality in front of Ledger's wife and children, but whenever he and Gylenhaal experience a disturbance in their relationship, he responds by berating his wife and threatening her with a beating.To me, this is just another gay-friendly movie with a twist. If it wins for Best Picture at the Oscars, it will prove that enough audiences and critics have been fooled yet again by the 'Hollywood Hype'.",6,3,35,17 February 2006
Spider-Man 3," Perhaps They Should Have Stopped At Number 2
","I thought 'Spider Man 3' was great. However, some of the special effects and acting are rather overblown, especially the scenes where Peter Parker, wearing the black Spidey suit, struts John Travolta-like down the street, occasionally stopping to do the hustle. The special effects used to create Sandman are also a bit much.To me, a better plot would have to be Peter asking Mary Jane to marry him at the beginning of the movie. Of course, the wedding can't go ahead until he takes care of all the villains, including himself when he's wearing the black suit.The casting of the villains is perfect. Topher Grace certainly isn't the wet noodle character he used to be on 'That 70s Show'. Here he exhibits a lot of intensity. The same goes for James Franco and Thomas Haden Church.",9,6,13,7 May 2007
Silent Hill," Scarier Than 'Resident Evil'
","I thought the two 'Resident Evil' movies were awful, but 'Silent Hill' is a bit better. It has excellent special effects and some truly brutal and gory scenes. If you were unable to play the video game on which the movie was based, watching the movie allows you to see the whole thing from beginning to end without even using a controller! I live near Hamilton, Ontario, and the Grand Hotel exterior is actually a historic building called Lister Block that's sadly fallen into disrepair and is now one of our town eyesores...so it may have to be torn down. I also noticed the city of Brantford in the movie, because one scene was filmed in the building next to the offices of 'The Brantford Expositor' newspaper.All I can say is that Hamilton and Brantford look like friendlier places to live than Silent Hill!",5,1,5,25 April 2006
Lost in Translation," Seabiscuit & Lost In Translation...Who's Gonna Win?
","I saw Seabiscuit and really enjoyed it.  It got my vote for Best Picture of 2003, but after seeing Lost In Translation, I'm stumped!  It's also a great movie with a great cast, plus you get lots of nice Tokyo scenery.  Bill Murray does very well in the role of Bob Harris, an American actor who's in Japan to shoot a commercial for a whiskey company.  Scarlett Johansen plays the wife of a rock star who's too busy to spend any time with her.  Murray and Johansen meet one night and strike up a friendship which almost blossoms into love...but not quite, since they're both already married.  Johansen is indeed beautiful.Rating: ****",Null,0,0,9 February 2004
Full Metal Jacket," HELL, I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!
","Although he gets killed off early in the movie, Lee Ermey's performance as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is one of the best.  This is a man who believes he has to abuse and swear at his men in order to make them excellent fighting machines.  Considering the military roles he has played in other films, Ermey was the best candidate for this role.  Meanwhile, Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as Private Pyle is brilliant and portrays a man who tries to take Hartman's abuse and the other abuse of his comrades as best he can and then finally snaps.  One can only wonder if he had survived the nighttime confrontation between himself and Hartman in the bathroom and had gone to Vietnam.  Would he have been alright?  Finally, another actor's performance as Animal Mother is also watchable, as he shows a solider who loves defending his nation against communism and shows only contempt for the Vietnamese, who he regards as terrorists and beggars.  Forget Eyes Wide Shut, this was Stanley Kubrick's true last masterpiece before his death.  It rates right up there with Spartacus, 2001 and A Clockwork Orange as one of his best.",Null,0,0,18 February 2002
Cold Mountain," The Real Civil War
","Movies in the Thirties like Jezebel and Gone With The Wind only showed the romantic side of the Civil War.  Cold Mountain takes the audience beyond that sentimental view and shows them the true and brutal nature of war, which made victims of everyone on both sides, soldier and civilian.Jude Law and Nicole Kidman play Southerners very well.  Renee Zellweger is good but her character tends to grate on the nerves after a while. Sometimes you may feel subtitles are necessary because the Southern accents are so thick.It's slow, so some patience is required.Rated R for nudity and gory violence.Rating: ***",Null,0,0,21 January 2004
The Shining," We all go a little mad sometimes...but do we go mad that quickly???
","Jack Kroll, a movie reviewer for Newsweek, called The Shining 'the first epic horror film'.  It is an epic to be sure, considering its length.  At times, it goes on a little too long.  Jack Nicholson does well as the crazy caretaker, but he goes mad so early in the film that it doesn't give us enough time to wonder what drove him to that point (other than the story about the caretaker who murdered his family in 1970, as explained to him when he's interviewed at the beginning of the film).  As for that hotel, it's a nice-looking place, but you might not want to spend a whole winter by yourself up there.  Not that you'd get murdered or anything, but you might find it very boring.The Shining is not a classic to me, but it's certainly better than Eyes Wide Shut.Rating: **",Null,0,1,5 January 2004
Rocky IV," THE BEST OF THE SERIES
","Rocky IV is the best of all the Rocky films.  Granted, Rocky III was good with the fight scenes between Sly and Mr. T, but Rocky II was simply Sly training for a rematch with Apollo Creed and Rocky V was just predictable. The best scene in the film is the final battle between Rocky and Drago. Rocky enters the arena in Moscow with thousands of Russian spectators booing him, but when Drago enters, they play this sound over the loudspeakers that sounds like an air raid siren, and then we hear the playing of the Soviet national anthem (they had some very good singers in that crowd).  When they play the anthem, you just can't help but stand up and be caught in the moment.Perhaps Sly and Brigiette Nielsen's marriage didn't last long because she always had eyes for Dolph Lundgren.",Null,0,0,28 January 2002
Resident Evil," Play the game instead
","I must admit that I've never played any of the Resident Evil games, but I can only hope that they are better than this turkey.  I rented it expecting to gain some scientific knowledge or that it would have some redeeming qualities, but this is not the case.  All they do is kill zombies and nothing else.  The film is really nothing more but a ripoff of Night of The Living Dead.",Null,0,0,5 August 2002
Tigerland," Does Uncle Sam Still Want You?
","I don't think Uncle Sam would be encouraging young men to join the U.S. Army if he saw the way those two drill sergeants (especially that bad bald one) were beating the crap out of new recruits.  To them, though, that's their way of toughening these men up to become ferocious fighting machines. After that stinkbomb '8MM', it's nice to see Joel Schumacher directing a nice and normal (albeit very foul-mouthed) movie again.  Colin Farrell, in his first American film, gives a wonderful performance.This is not a very long movie, unlike other Vietnam War epics, and the concentration on mainly character development and not on action means it's not for die-hard action fans.  It's probably worth seeing once just as a curiousity piece.My rating:  ** out of ****",Null,0,0,30 June 2003
Seabiscuit," Perhaps The Best Picture of 2003
","Seabiscuit, I believe, will be the top Oscar-nominated film at next year's Academy Awards.  It is definitely a Best Picture contender.The musical score, the cast and just about everything else is great.  Tobey Maguire and Beau Bridges will perhaps both receive nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.Like the little-known 1983 film Phar Lap, it's a wonderful movie that shows the triumph of the spirit.  Seabiscuit starts out as a horse who does nothing but eat and sleep, but with a little determination and help, he goes on to become one of the biggest names in horse racing.Rating:  ****",Null,0,1,5 August 2003
28 Days Later...," A horror movie with real characters and real emotions
","I enjoyed 28 Days Later because it features characters we can identify with. A guy called Jim wakes up in a London hospital and finds that the hospital is deserted.  Then he walks out onto the streets of London and finds them deserted too.  He looks at a newspaper and finds out why the streets are deserted.  A monkey-borne plague has spread across England and many people in the country have fled while others have died...or have they?  It turns out most of the 'dead' people are now flesh-eating, rage-filled zombies. After Jim narrowly escapes from a group of them, he takes refuge with two London citizens who survived the crisis and are now determined to save England from this virus.  They go to Jim's house, where Jim finds his parents dead in bed, a photo of him clutched in his mother's hand.  Jim breaks down and starts sobbing (real emotion).  Losing your parents is an awful experience, but it gets even worse when the parents come back to life as zombies and attempt to kill their son, so the freedom fighters pump them full of bullets, and Jim has to watch them die all over again.The loss of a parent is experienced again in the movie, when a little girl called Hannah watches her father turn into a zombie after being hit with infected blood and a group of soldiers gun him down.The ending is a bit of a trick.  I expected Jim's mother to be knocking on his bedroom door, and Jim wakes up in his own house and realizes it was all a dream.  That's as far as I'll go, because I don't want to give away anymore.It's no classic, but interesting.",Null,0,0,13 July 2003
K-19: The Widowmaker," Say No To The Cold War!!!
","Finally, an American movie about Russians that portrays them as human beings and not as cold and heartless communist terrorists.  This is sort of like 'Das Boot' set in the early 1960s, when the Cold War between America and Russia was at its highest.  They may not always speak with convincing accents, but both Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson do very well in their roles.Recommended.",Null,1,1,22 February 2003
The Untouchables," Have you ever read the book?
","Just a while ago, I ordered the paperback version of The Untouchables from a company that sells out-of-print and hard-to-find books.  There are some differences between characters and scenes in the movie that are featured in the book.  For example:1.  Instead of an all-white suit, Frank Nitti wears a blue suit with a grey fedora with a narrow black band.2.  Vito D'Ambrosio's character of Bowtie is called Rudensky in the book.3.  After the speakeasy bombing, Nitti is stopped by a suspicious patrolman. That scene was also supposed to be in the movie, but it was dropped before its release.4.  Ness's daughter is called Cora.  Her name was never spoken in the movie.5.  Ness has an informer named Stash Moser, who acts as an undercover agent during the disastrous first raid, but is killed by the mob shortly after.6.  Ness meets Jimmy Malone before the first raid, not after it.7.  The newspaper reporter who follows Ness around is called Ferguson, not Scoop.8.  After the first raid, Ness takes a walk around Chicago and finds himself in front of the Lexington Hotel, Capone's headquarters.9.  George Stone is called by his Italian name 'Giuseppe' by most of the other Untouchables members.10. Every Untouchables member except Oscar Wallace carries a tommygun during the battle at the Canadian border.11. The Capone member whom the Untouchables nab at the Canadian border is not Capone's bagman George, but his bookkeeper Walter Payne.12. The Chicago District Attorney's name is Ralph Morgan.13. When Ness goes to the hospital to visit his wife who's just given birth, three Capone men dressed as hospital workers attempt to kill him.  A gunfight ensues and all three Capone men are killed.14. Wallace isn't shot to death inside the elevator with the witness.  He gets killed after he steps out of the elevator at the bottom of the elevator tunnel, and Payne is picked up by Frank Nitti.15. We find out that Malone was married, but his wife died while giving birth to their child, and the child died too.  Also, his father was shot and killed by robbers a few years before he was scheduled to retire.16. Instead of chewing up Malone with tommygun bullets, Nitti shoots him in the head with a revolver and cuts his throat from ear to ear.17. The shootout at Union Station doesn't take place on the steps, but inside the train that's scheduled to take Payne to Florida.Sure, the movie may distort historical facts, but it's a great action film. If there had been an MTV Movie Awards back in 1987, Billy Drago could have taken home a Best Supporting Villain award for his chilling role as Frank Nitti.",Null,0,2,9 December 2002
The Last King of Scotland," Forest Whitaker Deserves The Best Actor Oscar
","THE LAST KING OF Scotland is one of the best movies of 2007. Forest Whitaker gives the performance of his career in the role of Idi Amin. James MacAvoy and the rest of the cast are brilliant. It's a classic story. A military general takes power and promises to lead his people and his country to great prosperity, but in the end he's no better than the megalomaniac he deposed in the first place.MacAvoy's character seems so strong against Whitaker's brutal Amin character, always remaining stoic and brave, even when Amin is enraged and shouting right in his ear.It's not an easy movie to watch, but it's definitely worth seeing, unless you abhor graphic violence.",10,3,4,11 February 2007
Gangs of New York," VERY LONG BUT A GREAT MOVIE NEVERTHELESS
","Leonardo DiCaprio is great as Amsterdam Vallon, but Daniel Day Lewis steals the film with his Oscar-nominated role as William The Butcher.  His explosive temper and hesitancy to kill an opponent who annoys him brings back memories of Joe Pesci's acclaimed role in Goodfellas.  It is so hard to believe that New York was so dangerous back then.  During one huge battle that involves the whole city, at the end New York looks a lot like Beirut as it might have been during the civil war in Lebanon.  Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,2 March 2003
