Iron Man 3," A fine end to one of the best superhero trilogies.
","****SPOILERS****I LOVED this movie.EPIC action sequences - Action sequences were the BOMB. I loved it. It had decent, well choreographed action where many things were happening simultaneously and still made sense. It was great.It had strong character development - He was influenced from the events of the Avengers. That's why he had PTSD. It was a whole and complete movie, and that and Cap2 are the movies in the MCU that I can feel happy watching over and over again, because they don't leave loose ends, have a bit of everything and they are completely exciting.ï»¿I have a few thoughts on the villain. Filmmakers often think that a villain who can sympathize with the audiences is the best. Most do that too. But Iron Man 3 was bold. It's decision to go with a hate- able villain and actually pulling it off is a feat onto itself.I mean, his motivations were simple itself. Sell Extremis and gain money. The way he pulled it off and the filmmakers displayed it was remarkable. He created a fake persona, the Mandarin, and enabled him to create war and terror. This in turn would create widespread panic among this US, and coupled with the killing of the US president and literally controlling USA when it's vice president came to power, would cause the nation to crumble and allow him to gain a profit.Killian was counting on the media to stare at the Mandarin's face value, and blowing it out of proportion, when he was charge the whole time.This was a very clever jab by Shane Black to the current hype created by the media by over blowing every threat, and turning every attack into a frenzy. Not to mention that it was a clever way of bringing back the post industrialist complex of Iron Man 1 and 2. The whole trilogy literally has a common and consistent theme. The post industrialist complex of evil businessmen and CEO's who could threaten the world, largely due to their immeasurable greed for money and power.The message may not have been as clear as, say, the TDK trilogy, but it still stands, and its very popular in the contemporary world.Overall, this movie was amazing. I loved it. Best of the trilogy, and I hope that Iron Man returns.9.5/10",10,0,2,23 February 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Exciting sequel that proves that Wheadon is the master of balancing characters.
","This is a spoiler free review. First off, let me begin by saying that this sequel has exceeded my expectations by a great amount. I was blown away by the sheer amount of spectacle and work Wheadon has put into making this sequel. Well, in terms of comparing it with the the first Avengers movie, it would be high impossible to impact pop culture in such a way the previous one did. Wheadon recognizes this, and hence the movie feels fresh because it takes a new path, a painful path for the heroes. It feels more personal, more on what it takes to be a hero and and how being a hero means having no place in society. It's definitely fresh, and avoids the mistake most sequels do by aiming to go bigger and more of everything.Avengers 2 isn't a mass event like it's predecessor, but instead a much better movie that chooses to focus on character arcs and most importantly, the story.Ultron played by James Spader is a great villain. He's just like a human trapped in robot's body. He behaves like a spurned son of Tony Stark, and hates his father more than anything. He also has twisted views on how to achieve peace, since he was 'born' very recently, and so sees nothing wrong with genocide because he isn't human. Unlike other Villains of Marvel, he doesn't just make a joke now and then, and in only scene is he humorous, simply because he is naive. In shot, he is a very, VERY unique villain that I've never seen before, and really hope that he returns.However, the thing I admired more about the movie was how Wheadon manages to for around 16 MAIN characters in the movie, give convincing origins for Quicksilver, Scarlrt Witch and Ultron, enough to symphatize with them throughout the movie. He does it skillfully and artfully and it is integrated seamlessly into the movie.Some of the so called critics have complained that the movie feels very fast and some scenes have to be deleted. However, I can honestly say that it is not so. Yes, there's a lot going on in the movie. But no, it isn't overstuffed. It simply means that you can enjoy this movie more and more every time you watch it. This is a movie that gets better with repeat viewings, because you absorb something new every time, whether it be something you missed or a fancy easter egg.Overall, this is a fantastic addition to the MCU, and possibly the best superhero movie of all time.9.5 out of 10",10,2,9,27 April 2015
