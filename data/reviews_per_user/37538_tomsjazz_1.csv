The Blair Witch Project," idiot plot
","Roger Ebert calls films like this 'idiot plots' i.e. if everyone in the movie wasn't an idiot, the movie would be over in 5 minutes. On the 'Win Ben Stein's Money' spoof of this film, Jimmy Kimmel asks Ben 'If you were going into the woods alone, wouldn't you take a cell phone?' Even more basic, how about climbing one of those tall trees, so you could find civilization again? The cinematography (if it deserves to be called that!) is nauseating and annoying, and I found the constant profanity unnecessary.Yecch!",Null,1,2,25 July 2000
