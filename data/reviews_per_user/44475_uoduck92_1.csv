It," Just Cannot Be Done...
","I get the dissatisfaction with the movie from those who read the book. I read it and it is an amazing piece of fiction with an extreme depth of emotion. Putting it on film for 2-3 hours (just the kid part) is overwhelming, so the screenwriter did what they could. I enjoyed it for what it was more than criticizing it for what it could have been.",6,0,1,12 June 2018
