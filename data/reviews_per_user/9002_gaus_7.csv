Raiders of the Lost Ark," My Favourite Of All Time
","Simply the best. This movie have combined action, adventure, horror & comedy on a magnificent way. Everything in this movie works, the actors, plot and effects is great, and I could also feel a magic touch in this great adventure movie (something you seldom finds in other movies). Highly recommended.The sequels was good, but not so good as this one.",10,0,0,17 November 1999
Underground," Not very entertaining
","I can't understand why anyone like this movie, it's sick, confusing and boring at the same time. I saw this on TV for about 2 month's ago and I must say that the only thing that I learned about it was the weird mentality of the people who lives in the Balkans. I just can't understand why they worship this mentality in movies. I have read most of the previous comments and I found that most of the people who liked this movie is from Eastern-Europe. The same people (not all) who protested against NATO's involvement in Kosovo & Bosnia. But it seams that this two missions finally ended most of the cruelties in this region. You should think about that ! I will also say that I mostly agree with Jochen Metzger's comment.This movie gets 2 out of 10 from me.",2,15,62,20 November 1999
Men in Black," Worst movie of the 90's
","A real disappointment and a waste of time. I was real stupid and bought this movie on video just to see if it was as good as some newspapers said. The real humans in this movie seems as much as aliens as the aliens do. The acting was just OK, the story never really took off, the special effects was not as good as I had expected and it never became funny. I sat waiting for something that never came in this film.Boring, stupid and overrated. (1 out of 10)",1,14,39,1 November 1999
Reservoir Dogs," Not a masterpiece
","A grim action movie with OK actors and OK story, but it's not a masterpiece. Tarrantino seams to add extreme violence and blood in all his movies just to shock the audience around the world. His characters are to one-dimensional to my taste, and I think his style will be exposed as a cheap way to thrill in the future.'From dusk to dawn' was mush better, see that one in stead.",6,7,13,1 November 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Trash
","One of the most overrated movies of the 90's. The actors are OK, but the rest of the film really stinks. It's far more depressing than scary. What's the point with a horror-movie with a huge budget and A-grade actors if that's is the most important in the movie. The point with a horror-movie is no.1 the story and the atmosphere & no.2 the actors. Why cant this great directors stick to their drama-projects as they usually do. And it's typical that this type of horror-movies get great review in the newspapers.I rather watch a grade-z horror-movie from the 70's. I don't think many horror-fans liked this one.",Null,0,1,11 November 1999
Jaws," Great horror
","One of the best horrorfilm ever made. I remember this was the first film I saw on video (in 1981, + Jaws 2 & Wild Geese). I was about 11 years old and thought it was the most exciting event in my life. I have seen this movie about 10 times after that and I still think it's great. A Highly recommendable film. Jaws 3 & 4 was trash.",10,1,2,9 August 1999
Heat," Best of the 90's
","This movie is probably the best movie of the 90's. Pacino and De Niro i just great. The climax, when Niro and his gang has just robbed the bank is the most intense and realistic action-scene I have ever seen in a movie. A must to see for action-fans. Also a film for people who like drama.",10,0,0,9 August 1999
