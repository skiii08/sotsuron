Blade Runner 2049," And the audience shuffled out.
","Well, there it is. Or was. But at least its over. Long isn't the word for this movie. Every single scene could have been cut in half. But the plot... the story.. well, what about it? Too long, too vague, too 2-dimensional. No life, no spirit.But most of all...No Rutger Hauer. Got to admit I wasn't a big fan of the original -- except for Rutger Hauer, who absolutely made the BR live. Replaced with the likes of Ryan Gosling, a guy who looks like he runs a day-care center on the side. And Harrison Ford is what he is, a flat-affect actor who struggles with anything other than a scowl. He made the original dull and he worked his magic on this one too. But where was the Rutger Hauer spirit of defiance and crushing sadness? Gone. Replace by characters with anger. Shoulda brought back Rutger and left Harrison to his airplane crashes.",2,1,4,30 December 2017
The Monuments Men," Not the worst movie I've ever seen
","It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen. It had some good points it was in focus, the lighting was good, I could (unfortunately) understand all the dialog, no animals were killed, the night scenes in the train yard were well shot.. But most of everything that goes to make up a good movie were missing. Like an intelligent screenplay, good acting, continuity, excitement.. you know, the stuff you pay for. Clooneys fingerprints were all over this thing -- mediocrity from the get-go. Somebody should pull that wig off his head and make him walk the length of Hollywood Boulevard with a big sign around his neck that says 'I'm paid too much and I think too little'. Oddly enough,if you want to see a good film about stolen French art, go grab a copy of The Train, with Burt Lancaster. Now THAT is a real movie. And you'll get your moneys worth.",2,2,3,12 November 2014
Child 44," Not the book but I liked it
","This is one of those movies where the little details become more interesting than the plot. Its a detective movie without the detective. The actors are fine, some are outstanding. The sets and location shots are excellent. Lighting and sound were fine. Cinematography was overall really well done. Two problems stick out. It's not the book. OK, so what? 'It's not the book' is almost an unfair criticism. But this movie didn't just take liberties with the story, it rewrote the damn thing. Almost like the scriptwriters overheard a broken conversation between two drunks talking about the book on an airplane flight, scribbled down some notes and pitched it to some money guy in Hollywood and bingo! got themselves a movie and a good bit of change too!. The second problem is the totally unsatisfying ending where the perp is I.D. and caught. Whoever the person was who thought of this ending should be banned from film forever. Don't assume the movie has a plot with a resolution, just watch it for the overall tone. Otherwise you'll be disappointed. The ending was abrupt, cartoonish, out of the logical sequence of events and obviously glued on because, well, why not? Deadline, y'know. Gotta meet that deadline. Still, with all of its flaws, taken in chunks that don't necessarily have to hang together at the end of the film (they don't) its a fascinating movie. Mix up patriotism, paranoia, betrayal and loyalty and watch out when they come to a boil. Just don't expect the ending to be the equal of the various excellent chunks of the movie. And read the book.",5,2,5,1 August 2015
Wind River," Buy the ticket
","I haven't seen a movie this good in a *long* time. Can't think of any way I'd improve it or criticize the actors or production values. It works on many levels, crime drama being just one. All the actors from the top down do splendid work, no false notes, dialog is adult, situations believable, resolution understandable. Renner is excellent but then so is every other actor in the film. As for the production stuff, also excellent. Pay the price for the ticket, see it on a good screen with good sound. You won't be disappointed.",9,1,4,3 October 2017
The Maze Runner," Lord of the Flies did it better
","This review is simple. Lord of the Flies meets CGI and the result will be SEQUELS. Which is the goal of movie-making these days. Make one movie and then make it over again. And again. And again. Was the original idea for Maze a ripoff from a better movie, a classic movie called Lord of the Flies (1963)? Yes, so what. Put the idea in a blender on high, add some CGI and some updated fear-factors and whammo ya got a project that can get some financial backing. Make more money by thinking less. Was Maze pointless without a real ending? Yes, so what. Leave the movie with a stupid unresolved ending so you can MAKE A SEQUEL. And sucker the rubes back in again. And again. Hell, the next generation of movie viewers won't even recognize the ripoff anyway.",3,2,4,30 November 2014
The Babadook," So much potential, so little resolution
","Babadook is an expansion of a ten minute short done by the director in earlier years. She should have kept it as a short and skipped the 'long' version. The pacing is.. well methodical I guess. The two actors do a good job, the photography is fine, the sound is a little over the top but what the film really lacks is a horror movie plot. Monster movies usually have a monster in them and Babadook plays games with the core element so much that by the time the movie ended I was confused, unsatisfied and scratching my head at the absence of a climax. Gave it a '3' because the lead actress was excellent, the kid did his role well and all the secondary characters were fine. Any monster movie done reasonably well can have scary moments but there's gotta be more to it than loud noises and quick editing. Asking the audience to fill in the gaps doesn't cut it. And no, its no 'Exorcist' or 'Haunting of Hill House', thats for sure.",3,16,44,14 December 2014
The Irishman," Seven, for the good times
","God, this guy knows how to set up a scene, how to use the actors, how to hang on to the dialog. But what he has forgotten is how to know when to say 'cut'. Visually, its fantastic. Not about the period pieces and all that but just the camerawork, the lighting, how the actors move through the scenes. But it was too much of every scene. Each could have been cut, make it tighter, less is more. I'm not gonna get into the performances, no problems there.It was just too much of a self-congratulatory display. Seven is fair. My advice is to watch it in chunks. Step away, have a sandwich, do the dishes.. whatever. Come back to it fresh.",7,1,2,2 December 2019
Interstellar," Not good, not bad
","First, the fun stuff. Its too long. By a good 30-40 minutes. Second, the sound is god-awful. As in *intentionally* god-awful according to Chris Nolan. Third, its just sort of an iffy story with an iffy ending. Now, the drudge work. MM does a good job as the lead and the supporting cast is also good. Not great, not award winning but competent and professional. The home world part of the story is not given enough of a boost and the interstellar part is given too much -- but then, Interstellar is the title and not Home World so they had to fluff up the title stuff. I kind of preferred the Home World storyline over the Interstellar as I thought it had more dramatic potential while avoiding the whole how-are-we-gonna-end-this-thing problem. No spoilers here and no long-winded stuff either. Its OK, go see it if you want to risk blood clots in your legs from sitting too long.",5,2,5,19 November 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Sad
","So much money wasted on such an adolescent silly movie. Unless you ride a motorcycle, this movie will offer you nothing but a couple hours squirming in your seat. By the way, I recommend an aisle seat close to the nearest exit. Makes your getaway that much easier. Not much to say about the movie itself -- because there isn't much there. A series of ego set- pieces for you know who, some touristy scenes for you know who, a chance for you know who to display his entire range of emotion from A to B, you know who gets to play dress-up and finally, you know who saves the world from Well, you know who ALWAYS saves the world. On the other hand, looping this movie will make for some mighty potent torture sessions.",2,20,44,27 September 2015
The Favourite," Truth - I couldn't watch it all.
","I tried to sit through it but somewhere around 2/3 of the way into the movie I gave up. What did it? That crazy droning soundtrack overlay in some scenes. Who dreamed that up? It was like sitting in a dentists chair getting a root canal.As for the movie itself, it was ok. Boring but ok. I would recommend turning the sound off and simply enjoying the splendor of how the aristos spent our money.",3,1,7,28 January 2019
A Quiet Place," Accept the premise and watch the movie.
","Lots of pissed off people writing reviews doesn't mean the movie isn't entertaining. Most whiners seem to want every t crossed and every i dotted or they'll call it a bad movie. Accept the premise. Its pretty clear. Take it from there. Its a movie, not a political trial. As for the acting ... it was fine. Not overblown, no precocious child actors stealing scenes, adults that expressed a range of emotions. As for plot holes, hey.. life has plot holes. Use your imagination to fill in the gaps.",7,1,3,28 June 2018
Jurassic World," One plot, four movies.
","I gave it a four out of sympathy for the animals. No, not the human ones, the other ones. We humans exterminate animals in real life and even on film, we still feel obligated to kill them off at the slightest pretext. This series says something about humans and it ain't good. Humans kill. We kill *everything*. And then we pat ourselves on the back. I'm waiting for some imagination here and not seeing any. Same old plot, they changed the heads of the bodies is all. The animals still look the same, the labs still look the same, the jungle still looks the same and the island.. well guess what? It still looks the same. This movie series fixation with a dinosaur park is making Michael Crichton giggle in his coffin. Or his cold-storage nitrogen tank. Whatever. Hope he's still collecting his piece of the action somehow. No imagination, lots of money splashed all over the screen. Lots of 'lets keep it in the groove' thinking. The producers must have gotten a few real belly laughs as the storyline tracks along about cynically keeping the park visitors entertained and distracted while doing just the same thing with the movie audience, manipulating them time after time, scene after scene movie after movie, to cough up their money again like the suckers they know us to be. Maybe next time they'll show some testicular fortitude and bring back a *real* killer with a 2 million year successful track record. Homo Erectus - He's give us a run for our money. You wuz warned.",4,2,7,14 July 2015
Silence," Delusions of an old man seeking salvation
","Nice photography. Great looking countryside. Interesting depiction of life in Japan in the 17th century, if accurate. Otherwise long. Repetitive. Much looking at my watch. Fidgeting. Some degree of astonishment at how stupid religion is at its core and yet people can still make a buck producing stuff like this. I didn't like it. I don't recommend it. You want peace and serenity.. go sit in a mountain meadow away from any believers of any kind yammering in your ear, guilt tripping you, twisting your mind into knots. Sit and breath. Alone. Again, nice photography.",2,18,34,22 January 2017
Jack Reacher," If you read the books, skip the movie
","If you haven't read the books and the sight of Tom Cruise doesn't make you squirm, then you'll probably like this vehicle for his talent. Or not. The books are formulaic but interesting in a long airplane flight kind of way. Buy them at the newsstand before the flight and you'll finish before you land, leaving it in the seat back for the next passenger. Jack Reacher in the books is basically a big, strong guy with a brain. He uses his imposing physical self to get his way and if that doesn't do it he beats people up. If that doesn't do it he uses his formidable brain. These qualities are the absolute core of the character and the story revolves around them. Tom Cruise has neither of these things going for him. He's short, skinny and probably has somebody carry his scripts around for him. He also doesn't come across as a particularly brainy kind of actor or character. Missing these qualities but trying to put ol' Tom into the character of Jack Reacher is going to sabotage the entire storyline. And it did. At no point did I see Tom Cruise as anything but a Southern California rich boy dressed up in a leather coat (to add a little bulk to his skinny frame). The story became increasingly unbelievable and ol' Tom got deeper and deeper into the 'are you kidding me' place where serious movies never want to go. Take a plane flight and grab one of Lee Childs books, you might enjoy it. But skip the movie unless Tom starts taking growth hormone and bulking up.",2,0,3,26 July 2015
Centurion," Men running in the mountains...
","There is nothing special about this movie at all. Zip. Average everything.. acting, direction, sets, cinematography, dialog plot too. Its just a too-long story. I can't even call it confused as there isn't that much to it. Long, really long scenes of guys running through the mountains. Up the mountains. Down the mountains. Across the streams, around the trees. Some very bloody fighting filmed in such a way as to make it impossible to tell who was killing and who wasn't. Witches, mutes, little princes, Roman governors, bar fights where is Kirk Douglas when he's really needed to give a movie some pizazz.",5,3,6,7 October 2017
Prometheus," Keep your money in your pocket
","I paid my money and now I'm gonna post my first review after years of being on IMDb. This movie is flat-out awful. From the very start to the bitter end, its disjointed, poorly scripted, without direction and an utter waste of money -- to the viewers at least. I'm sure the industry profited from its production as I'm sure Ridley Scott made his pile of loot. But the producer seriously ought to stand up in front of the audience and say 'I'm Ridley and I now make lousy movies'. The characters are superficial, unbelievable and given some of the worst dialog ever. I truly believe the master copy of the script fell off a table, the pages got mixed up and in their rush to start the money train rolling the producers just said 'the heck with it, just say whatever lines you feel like.. I'm losin' money here talking'...'. Don't see it. Don't waste your money. Rent the original Alien and enjoy a tightly crafted imaginative flick that isn't a pretentious crap dumbed down to meet some strange audience demographic.",1,5,7,25 September 2013
Spectre," Forgettable
","Somebody ought to go back and watch the first two or three Bond movies. Keep it simple, stupid. Don't expect noise, bright flashes of light, quirky camera angles and overwrought villains to deliver a watchable film. This movie was not only forgettable, its ignorable. If you do get suckered into seeing it, bring your earplugs. And a good book. I'm starting to see a pattern in my reviews. Trainloads of money tossed into the process with the expectation of getting a good movie at the end of the day never works. I'd much rather watch a low-budget 'B' movie with heart than any of these bloated committee-driven fiascos like Spectre. A good idea goes a long way but a bad one leaves a stink behind it. Skip Spectre. Read the Fleming books, especially the early ones.",2,6,14,25 November 2015
Donnie Darko," Skip it unless you're in 9th grade
","The movie is clearly a vehicle for young actors to show their stuff to industry insiders. Like an extended audition, the plot is unnecessary, the continuity irrelevant and the ending is only needed to let people know the audition is over and they can leave. At least the crew got some work, made a little money, kept the economy afloat for a while. So much of what is churned out by Hollywood is simply make-work for people, a way to keep money changing hands back and forth, create a void where money can be siphoned off without the tax-man knowing about it. This movie is a prime example of that. If you're looking for some redeeming value in this turkey, skip it unless you're in 9th grade and like to make faces at people in the school hallways.",2,4,7,29 August 2013
Alien: Covenant," Idea has been officially beaten to death
",And I thought Prometheus was bad. Cashing in is the best way to describe this movie. This film is proof that somebody in the room should raise their hand in the pre-production meetings when an obvious turkey is being prepped for the oven. Reputations will suffer. Maybe he or she did and got fired. Who knows. At least it was an honorable way to go. Guy Pearce must have seen something suspicious -- like the script -- because his role is uncredited. Good for him. Bad for Ridley Scott who probably laid this bird out during a hot tub session with a bottle of Jim Beam. Save your money. Invest wisely.,1,6,11,3 July 2017
