Sucker Punch," Be unprepared
","In it's entire, the film is great to watch. However I did expect more from Zach Snyder. The slogan 'You will be unprepared' didn't apply to me since I've been waiting to see this since I saw the teaser, which was about a half year ago, so I expected a lot from it. So maybe I was too prepared and was therefor disappointed after wards, the same feeling I had with Watchmen.Furthermore the film tries to send a message that, with me at least, didn't come through. The magnificent action-scenes make me forget that there is something more to the film. You have to remember the storyline and pay attention to every word to follow the plot, which can be hard with all that shooting.You should see the film if you like Snyder's work, if not you should go for the action. Go see it unprepared, with not the highest expectations, and you will enjoy it more than me.",6,5,16,24 March 2011
