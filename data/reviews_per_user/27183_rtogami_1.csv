Iron Man 3," Not as good as expected...
","First, I'd like to say I'm a comics reader for the last 30 years... although I can draw, I think the most important part of the comics are the stories. IMO, no point in good art and poor plot, but the opposite works most of the time. That being said (and Iron Man being one of my fav), I feel comfortable to point a few things about this movie.I honestly was expecting a lot more. And this is not a conclusion, I felt this as I was seeing the movie. Teasers and trailers looked amazing, everything kids (even big ones like me) wanted. By the expectation, I was hoping to see a cool movie with lots of FX... all the FX are there, but this wasn't enough, the plot is too weak, poorly developed and rushed. There are explosions and armors everywhere, but not really a point for them to be there. The movie was shot in a way that looks confined, no big sets and nice landscapes too. In the end of the movie I had that feeling that nothing (that matters) really happened.I'm also disappointed with the way some good Iron Man story arcs are smashed together in a plot full of things happening but for no real purpose. I recognized some armors from the comics... in the comics, the armors have a 'why', they have a reason to exist and designed for a practical application, but the movie completely ignores that.One other thing I like in Iron Man is the impossible technology based on 'possible' technology (last 2 movies had some of this). This movie lacks this compromise with technology... the armor does things that had me thinking 'hey, how it did that? And why it had to be done that way?', among tech things that wasn't supposed to work the way they did in the movie.The main armor Tony uses is ugly. Can't tell much more about this or I'll spoiler this review, but it's ugly, what was Tony Stark thinking when he built that thing?Worth seeing it? Only if you're not that familiar with Iron Man and/or want to see the cast (Robert Downey Jr is outstanding as usual, Sir Ben Kingsley is just amazing). And, as strange as it sounds, if you don't care too much about the whys and hows in technology.I'm rating this as a 6 because the actors are good. By the story alone it would be a 3.
