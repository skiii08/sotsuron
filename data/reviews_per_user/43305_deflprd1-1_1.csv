The Blair Witch Project," Dumb, waste of good money
","This was one of the dumbest movies I've seen, not scary in any way, quite laughable. I do believe the makers ripped off a similar movie , I'm thinking that it might be called The Last Broadcast, which is in the same vein, but far superior to Blair Witch. Don't waste your money.",Null,2,4,6 August 2002
