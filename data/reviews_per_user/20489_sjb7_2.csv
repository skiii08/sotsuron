Requiem for a Dream," Reality can be quite nightmarish
",This movie is a minor masterpiece. It should be required viewing for Those involved in drug counciling. I have never viewed a film that thrust itself so powerfully and truthfully. We find ourselves inside each of the brilliantly portrayed characters and feel the unrelenting agony they endure.This is film making at its' best. It is a filmmakers film. There has never been anything quite like. It deserves repeated viewing.,Null,0,1,21 August 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A film you can watch over and over.
","Each time I view this film I always discover something I missed at a prior viewing. This time it was the opening music soundtrack. It was such a perfect fit.' Try a little tenderness' was such an appropriate choice to only add to the zany hilarity of this of' brilliant film. Peter Sellers,in his arguably best role(s) is a master of disguise and George C. Scott turns in a stellar performance. The rest of the cast is up to the task of making this one of moviedoms greatest. My favorite part is the war room scene and the discussion between the President and General 'Buck'. The banter between the two of them is most uproarious and the steadfast demeanor of Sellers is a true testament to his acting genius. This film along with 'A Clockwork Orange' I think are Kubrick at his best.",10,5,9,23 February 2006
