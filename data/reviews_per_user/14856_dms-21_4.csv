Blade Runner 2049," Too long and too slow
","This is almost a 3 hour movie, but it honestly felt like at least 4 hours watching it. The pace starts off okay, but then seems to lag as minor plot lines take far too long to work through. The original had atmosphere and character; in this one they work very hard to create similar magic, but fail.",4,27,60,5 October 2017
The Impossible," Blah Family in Disaster
","We went to see this based on a trailer that looked great combined with excellent reviews, but were very disappointed. The worst of it was that the characters lacked depth. 'Blah Family in Disaster' would be a better title for this movie, since that's what you get. It seems like the director made a half-hearted attempt to establish some emotional depth for the characters before the disaster struck, but couldn't figure out how so just gave up and hoped that seeing them going through a hellish experience was all the plot he needed. What came out is chaos without any real drama.Need to pad this for the line counter, so if I'll just say that if you're looking for a disaster *drama* rent Earthquake, or even Deep Impact - just about anything with a disaster theme is better than this, except perhaps Mars Attacks!",2,11,28,13 February 2013
Insidious," Painful to watch
","This movie is boring and painful to watch. The acting is mediocre at best, with the father, in particular, showing the emotional range of a clam. The story is trite. I kept waiting for some kind of kicker that would make the movie worth watching, but was left at the end feeling I'd wasted 2 hours and 20 minutes of my life.There are many bad horror movies made, but most of them at least try to compensate for bad acting and stupid plots with lots of sex, gore, or both. This one has neither.I can't believe they're making a sequel. Who are the people who would actually want to watch this? Do yourself a favor, and stay far, far, away from this (and from the sequel).",1,2,3,21 September 2013
30 Days of Night," Horrible waste of time
","This is one of the worst films I've ever watched. The basic idea sounds good - 30 days of night sounds like an all-you-can-eat buffet for vampires, right? - but the plot, dialog, and acting are all uniformly bad. Only gore-fest fans who don't care about anything else will find this film enjoyable.The lead vampire does nothing except screech and glare, but I'd rate him as the best actor in the film. At least he shows a much better range than the wooden performances of the leading man and woman. Unfortunately the vampires, despite their superhuman powers, are made into bumbling idiots by the plot. 30 days of night and they can't even search a small town? I thought vampires were only supposed to sleep in the day time, so what was this bunch doing the whole time?I could go on for a long time, but don't want to include anything that might be considered a spoiler. Though the word 'spoiler' is not something that could meaningfully be applied to this piece of trash.",1,1,2,20 May 2008
