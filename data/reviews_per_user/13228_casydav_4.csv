Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Same opinion 20 yrs later....
",We have been revisiting the 1st and 2nd trilogies after seeing the conclusion of the third. This movie has been my least favorite and it still holds that title for me. I did enjoy Obi and Qui-Gon and the fight sequences involving Dark Maul were good but the same issues I had when I originally watched were even more aggravating somehow now. Jar Jar Binks-What can I say that hasn't been said? He would have been annoying given a few minutes screen time but I must have blocked out how big of a role he had. Just painful to watch. Also Natalie Portman has zero charisma and is as wooden as she's ever been. Im a bit fan of the franchise so gave it 5 stars as it is a piece of that larger puzzle but do not think I'll include it in future binges. I thought time and nostalgia might soften my view but that was not the case.,5,1,2,2 January 2020
Captain Marvel," Met my low expectations
",Wow where to start? Won't waste a lot of time on Brie-she has zero charisma or range. Samual Jackson was great IF you thought of him as a different character then Fury. The entire ha ha look at the nineties fell flat and the soundtrack was distracting at best. I went from being mildly entertained to highly annoyed when I'm Just a Girl broke out and the movie slipped into Disney sitcom territory. Two best things about the movie is the cat and Jude Law back to form after playing Dumbledore.,5,2,3,1 April 2019
Suicide Squad," Yes The Joker was awful but...
",Harley Quinn was as annoying as any character I have ever seen. Having no background on the Suicide Squad it seems she nailed the role according to several reviews but I cringed every time I had to hear her voice or even look at her. Between this and her non role in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood I cannot stand to see anything she is in.,1,6,10,3 February 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's Mix of Humor & Drama unmatched
",Very entertaining movie and made me laugh throughout. A wonderful reminder of just how talented Leo and Brad are. Best parts for me was watching Jack trying to cope with the fact that his star is on the decline. Scene in trailer with him after messing up lines was perfection. Like several have commented my main complaint would be all of the time spent with Sharon Tate. It didn't add anything to the plot and would have been fine seeing a lot less of her-she was actually pretty annoying and one dimensional throughout. Loved the surprise ending. Was waiting for the cutaway to show what happened to Cliffs wife....pretty sure I can imagine it. Lol.,8,11,28,27 July 2019
