Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," compares favorably with earlier episodes
",Very well done. I think it is as good as earlier episodes. Special effects are great.  Ready for the next one. And may the force be with ye.,8,0,0,2 June 1999
Unbreakable," Just a very fine piece of work once again...
","This director is destined for great things.  Great atmospherics, photography, pacing, plot development and the plot twist, make this a movie not to miss.  Extraordinary work imho by Samuel Jackson as well, who plays an unusual role for him.",9,1,1,24 November 2000
Elizabeth," A must-see for Anglophiles
","A fine, rich, fascinating movie. Recommend it for the literate, history-inclined, those who are fascinated with the history of Protestant/Catholic politics.",9,0,0,29 November 1998
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton's worst movie to date
","Silly, puerile, banal, relied on overused special effects.  The fifth decapitation and blood-spurt lost its zing.  Johnny Depp was a fool to take this role. He just lost my vote as a serious actor. And he had done so well up till now.  If they had stuck to the original story by Washington Irving, at least the plot would have been interesting. A real disappointment.",2,5,10,20 November 1999
Cast Away," A nice pot roast but not filet mignon
","Cast Away is a fine movie for mainstream Hollywood. It is a Sears kind of movie.  Nothing too offensive or challenging, stays on main street, no forays into the darker sides of the psyche.  Hanks chooses his vehicles well, as compared to many of the other male superstars like Hanks and Gibson who have sold out completely. I found the plot a bit contrived, and the most impressive special effect was the Hanks weight loss.  Helen Hunt is in too many movies.  Period.  She needs to take a vacation.",7,0,0,30 December 2000
The Patriot," Cinematic pap on the big screen
",The movie starts out with promise but quickly descends into yet another dreary formulaic revenge movie.  Lots of gratuitous gore to embellish a weak script.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone for any reason.,3,1,2,2 December 2000
Moulin Rouge!," A visual and aural feast
","Another great movie from the creator of 'Strictly Ballroom'.  In many ways this quirky, visually extravagant movie reminds me of the much lower budget Strictly Ballroom.  A bit overwhelming visually at times, would have been better toned down a bit, but still a masterpiece.",9,0,0,3 June 2001
Mission: Impossible II," A boring disappointment
","This movie was just plain a disappointment. Thin plot, contrived action and the only redeeming thing was Thandie Newton, and if you want to see here in a REAL role, check out Beloved. Now THAT was a Thandie Newton movie.  The action is gratuitious, and unless you are a kung fu student, will be boring. I would recommend you do not waste your money on this sleeper.",3,0,0,18 June 2000
Shrek," A fine fantasy film..good for kids too
",A rare combo these days. Great animation and a film that both adults and kids will enjoy.  It is multi-layered in an onion kind of way. Very enjoyable.  I also like the fact that the ending is quite anti-Hollywood...gives me pause that there might be some real creativity going on at Dreamworks after all...,8,0,0,20 May 2001
Shrek," One of the better animation efforts in a long time...
","Great animation, clever plot, genuinely funny gags, and an all round enjoyable film.  Double meanings keep the adults chuckling while kids can thoroughly enjoy this movie as well.  Highly recommend it for kids 7 and older.",8,0,0,28 May 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," All the elements of a theatrical masterpiece...
","Drama, tragedy, humor, over-the-top reenactments of the Odyssey...this movie had it all.  Plus the authentic southern gospel/hillbilly music is extraordinary, particularly John Hartford's rendition of Man of Constant Sorrow..a wonderful version of a gospel classic.  The casting, cinematography, writing and plot were nearly perfect. Do not miss this movie. It may be the Cohen Brothers' best.",9,0,0,21 January 2001
