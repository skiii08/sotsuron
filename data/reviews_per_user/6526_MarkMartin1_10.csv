The Avengers," Chemistry on and off screen!

Spider-Man 2," Great actors!
","Alfred Molina delivered a top performance in this film! Even with the short screen time, he made such a great impact on the overall quality of the movie.",8,0,0,26 November 2019
Spider-Man 3," Too bad
",If only they could've done a better job with Spider Man 3. It would've been up there together with Matrix as one of the few trilogies that didn't suck,7,0,0,26 November 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," It's more family-friendly. I like it

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Too good!
",Oh wow. I am blown away. How on Earth did an animated film such as this do so well? And how were they able to take all these separate characters and give them so much development without the film feeling like it was dragging.,10,0,0,26 November 2019
Spider-Man," Well done on the pacing!
",Making superhero films is tricky in the sense that you have to have that balance of fight scenes to make it enjoyable and enough characters' back stories to really give those characters some depth.,10,1,2,26 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," It was such a drag
",Some of the scenes were unnecessary and could've been just cut out entirely and the movie would still make sense. I expected more from this 3-hour film but it turned out to be just a complete waste of time.,7,0,3,26 November 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Just plain bad
",Don't be brainwashed. This is just a remix of the first Avengers movie. Nothing new here except for the new heroes but plot-wise it's pretty much the same thing.,6,0,0,26 November 2019
Thor," Good scriptwriting here
","I appreciate very much how they wrote the script, especially the ones for the denizens of Asgard. Well-spoken without being too clunky as Old English would sound.",9,0,0,26 November 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Figure it out on your own
",It would've been better if they gave us more information about the bad guy. Sure he's just another villain but a back story would've still been great.,7,0,0,26 November 2019
