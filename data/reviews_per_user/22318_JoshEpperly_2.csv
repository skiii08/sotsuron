Walk the Line," If you don't like the music, there's not much else for you.
","For the most part, I enjoyed Walk the Line. It was very entertaining, but it has its flaws. It really is a pretty cliché story, it shows the ups and downs in a man's career, nothing you haven't seen before. It shows his rise to frame, his introduction to drugs, his fall, his rising back up, and getting the girl in the end. We've seen this before in better movies. Not to say that it doesn't have redeeming qualities, though. If you enjoy Johnny Cash's music(and the popular music of that time), you'll love the music of this film. As a lover of all music I very much enjoyed the soundtrack, and all the musical performances are all very good. I had heard so many good things about the musical performances before seeing the movie but I always assumed that it was just digitally enhanced to sound good. After listening to the commentary of this film, I discovered that the director, James Mangold(a director I more or less respect), didn't want to have anything like that, because this is a film about people who wouldn't have any of that in their own music, even if their vocals were a little off, as long as it portrayed the emotion and message of their music, they sold it; so doing what these artists despised would really be incompetent of him. Also, Joaquin Phoenix's performance(not musically, just acting) was spectacular. A specific scene on stage is a shining example of not only this, but the direction as well, is one on stage with Cash on drugs. The performance, combined with the direction and camera-work made the best scene in the film. All-in-all, it is a very cliché film sprinkled with some great things, it's not all bad, yet not great, either.",6,0,0,23 March 2016
500 Days of Summer," Cliché, overrated, but not terrible
","This review contains spoilers for not only 500 Days of Summer but the movies Her, and Midnight in Paris, as well. The passage with the spoilers will be in all CAPS, so if you don't want these films spoiled, avoid that section.By most reviews I've seen, 500 Days of Summer is considered to be criminally underrated and deserves more attention. It happens a lot with me that a film is called underrated so many times that when I finally get to seeing it, it becomes overrated, in the case of Dredd, Edge of Tomorrow, and now 500 Days of Summer. It's a very generic film with attempts at trying to hide it. We've all seen the character types before. The antisocial male protagonist who meets the outgoing, different-from-every-other girl he falls in love with; Zooey Deschanel having gotten this character sown to a science, it being really the only character type she plays. People often say that this film is different from other romantic (comedy) films because it takes place from the perspective of the male in the relationship, but many others do that, (Her, and Midnight in Paris, for example). ANOTHER ARGUMENT IS THAT THE MAIN CHARACTER AND HIS LOVE INTEREST DON'T END UP TOGETHER IN THE END. AND AGAIN, MIDNIGHT IN Paris AND HER DO THIS AS WELL, AND BETTER. MIDNIGHT IN Paris EVEN HAVING ALMOST THE EXACT SAME ENDING, IN THAT THE LEAD FINDS A DIFFERENT GIRL AND THE FILM ENDS HAPPILY WITH HIM AND HER, THAT BEING MY ONLY REAL PROBLEM WITH MIDNIGHT IN Paris.The only thing about this film that I haven't seen before is the nonlinear plot, which keeps things relatively interesting, but that may have been done before, and I don't know it, as I don't seek films of this genre too often for fear of ending up with one like this. In the end, I don't think 500 Days of Summer is a bad movie, but not very good, either. It's not very original, but I can see it tried to be, and I acknowledge that. I'm giving this a positive rating, still, because of that and the fact that it was still entertaining and occasionally pretty funny.",6,0,0,2 April 2016
