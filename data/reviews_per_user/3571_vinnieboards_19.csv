Blade Runner 2049," Moments lost in time, like tears in rain...
","I'm really sad posting this. I so wanted to love this film, I really did. But it didn't quite happen.There is much to admire about Bladerunner 2049. For starters, the cinematography is breathtaking. There are so many shots in this film that are staggering. As a viewing spectacle it is up there with the very best; it is a consumate work of art at times.Then there is the soundtrack. Some find it too loud and overbearing. I disagree with that view. The soundtrack pays fitting homage to Vangelis and adopts original and variations on his original themes. It could never match the Vangelis soundtrack but it comes mighty close. Unfortunately in the digital age there is a lack of quirkiness, rawness and bravado which made the analog original so timeless. It's a bit too clean, too well produced in comparison. But to be honest, as a standalone work it is superb. Sea Wall is a particularly good.However this is where my positive critique sadly ends. This film fails for me on a number of levels. Firstly, it doesn't move you like the original nor does it thought provoke either. When Roy Batty dies in the original film it is truly moving - the villain of the film ultimately values life to such an extent that he dies without taking out revenge on his persuer and nemesis. In this film, there just isn't that same depth or level of connection. When Joe dies at the end he goes out with a tame, almost pathetic whimper.The other main issue is that the plot takes so long to unravel over nearly 3 hrs. What started as intrigue soon turns into tedium. Gosling does a fine job in the lead role but this film is a good 40 minutes too long.Rightly of wrongly it's a sequel and therefore will be compared to the original. For all the gorgeous sets, camera shots and atmospherics, Bladerunner 2049 is no match for the groundbreaking original.Joi is an interesting character and was well acted but Wallace's henchwoman, whilst vicious, never reaches the unpredictable menace and ruthlessness of Roy Batty. Jared Leto as Wallace was intriguing but under used. And the CGI version of Sean Young's Rachel was clever but in my opinion, her addition smacked of desperation in the end. Deckard's introduction was so late and so brief that it became almost insignificant. Yet he is so pivotal to the storyline.Personally, I think the filmakers did a solid but underwhelming job with what proved to be an impossible task and they should at least be applauded for even attempting it. But to sum up, if the studio have designs on making another Bladerunner film, then I will quote the wise words of the late and rather great Rutger Hauer...Time to die.The film is a genuine work of art for sure, but is let down by a seriously tedious, slow plot line and a total lack of emotional depth.",5,1,2,6 September 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The best Stars Wars Film of them all - HONEST!
","Oh yes - in my honest opinion, this is THE best Star Wars film of them all. Even better than The Empire Strikes Back, and that is some claim so at least I should attempt to explain myself (I may struggle!).I stand by opinion 1000%. Up until Rogue One appeared on our screens, The Empire Strikes Back was the go-to movie. Dark, sinister and moody with spectacular set pieces, the film took the Star Wars universe to a different level, focusing on the desperate fight between good and evil (which in essence is what this franchise is all about). Nothing before or since this film has come even close; in comparison, most of the other movies are either a bit tame or just plain dreadful. So watching Rogue One was not an experience where I had the feeling of much hope (but then Rebellions, as they say, are built on hope!) After 2 hours and 13 minutes, I realised that I had not just watched a great Star Wars film - I had watched the best one of all.Why? OK, here goes.The Plotline
It's ingenious. How the writers managed to take a line from Mon Mothma in 'A New Hope' and turn it into a 2-hour long film is smart, to say the least. And it works too. The idea of creating a back story focusing on how the plans for the Death Star come into the hands of the Rebel Alliance is a stroke of genius. The story is compelling and introduces an entirely new cast and with one fundamental difference between all Stars Wars films. There is no hope for the main protagonists; there is no happy ending. Here lies true heroism in the face of Imperial annihilation.The Cast & Characters
One of the difficult hurdles that Rogue One needed to get over was creating characters that the audience could believe in, and the producers achieved this in most parts, flawlessly. It helps that, unlike in previous iterations, the cast of this film act exceptionally well. Felicity Jones (as Jyn) does a fantastic job and at times, delivers a barnstorming performance. Cassian's objectives are shrouded in mystery, and he gives a brooding, tortured performance. Baze (Wen Jiang) and Chirrut (Donnie Yen) are bickering buddies and stellar, triumphant heroes. Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) plays the villain of the piece gloriously over the top. However, the laughs and the stand out performance all come from Alan Tudyk as K-2SO. A literal, caustic and sarcastic droid who delivers his lines with a blunted severity that has you laughing out loud. No gimmicks, no ingenious tech. It is the character aspect that makes K-2SO the best droid of all.Set Pieces
It's easy to forget how many fabulous set-pieces there are in this film. The most expansive is the battle on and above Scarif, but there are so many more. The fight scenes and destruction of Jedha, the attack on the crystal mining colony. There is, of course, a lot of CGI going on here but it is delivered at such a pace and in such an exhilarating way that it immerses you in the Star War Universe and gives you the box seat.Bad Bits?
Well, there are some but thankfully very few, and not enough to detract from what is an epic movie. Saw Gerrera is dissapointing which is a surprise considering Forrest Whittakers acting credentials. The film also delivers an astounding piece of CGI and then near the end, an utterly laughable one. I thought Peter Cushing had miraculously come back from the dead or there was a doppelganger in the acting world, for at least for a few seconds. The way the filmmakers did this with CGI was impressive, using a real actor and a voice that sounded very similar. However, Leia's appearance at the end was shockingly bad, totally unconvincing, and one intelligent step too far. It was unnecessary in the scheme of things. Vaders voice didn't work either which is nobody's fault since James Earl Jones is now 89, and his voice has lost that sinister grit. He could have been helped with some better dialogue to be honest. 'Be careful not to choke on your aspirations, Director' seemed a bit contrived to me. Not the least bit scary.Still, Rogue One is an unexpected gem. When compared to all that has gone before, it is better written, better produced, better acted and does one thing that all other Star Wars film failed to do apart from Empire. It makes you care. For me, there are only two Star Wars films worth watching. This one is the most fulfilling although the Battle of Hoth for me is still the standout sequence of any in the entire franchise.Please take note Disney - originality, competent acting, real drama and not so happy endings make better films rather than the regurgitated nonsense of the Force Awakens, The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker.Today's children are intelligent enough to take it.",9,3,4,3 April 2020
Mississippi Burning," Tension versus Schmaltz - what would you choose?
","Mississipi Burning will always be remembered for one of the greatest injustices delivered in modern history.Whilst no one can deny that Rainman and the performances, especially from Dustin Hoffman are top draw,it is not a patch on Mississippi Burning and yet Rainman cleaned up at the Oscars against this magnificent movie's expense. A travesty of justice but not a surprise.Once again (as with Forrest Gump), schmaltz wins the day. And yet as a piece of movie making, Mississippi Burning is one of the best I've seen for many years.The shocking and brutal way the movie unravels the story of racist bigotry in the Deep South during the Sixties is at times incredibly difficult to watch. Yet watch you will, due in part to a magnificent acting performance from Gene Hackman, backed up by a career best performance from Wilem DeFoe.Hackman & Defoe basically want the same thing - justice for some activists who have gone missing and who they suspect have been murdered. The only problem being that their methods are poles apart - Defoe does everything by the book whilst Hackman does the opposite using intimidation to divide the tight lipped community.The film is both moving and educational (and brave!) It is based on a true story and I don't really care how true the film is to this story or indeed how there may be certain historical inaccuracies or flaws. As a single coherent piece of cinema the film delivers in abundance. Even the ending whilst positive, is not euphoric and again highlights the bigotry and corruption around at the time. Many of these protagonists are spared jail but you at least get the feeling that it's 'a start'.This is not a 'feel good' film and was never meant to be. But the acting and imagery of this piece lasted longer in my memory than Rainman which whilst good, is too sentimental and gushing at times.Conclusion? Gritty, tension laden films win over schmaltz every single time.",10,1,2,17 December 2010
Elizabeth," Movie Makers & the Great Elizabethan Tampering Scandal
","What is a really good film could have been a masterpiece if it wasn't for the poetic licence used by the makers of this movie.Why on earth a movie studio wants to tamper with historical facts when the real story is perfectly fine and intriguing in its own right is beyond me. Take the assassination of Mary of Guise – there is no evidence that she was assassinated by Francis Walsingham. In fact by most accounts she died of natural causes. Walsingham was not an assassin or a murderer. He was the Queen's Protector or 'Spymaster' as he was known. In essence, the Elizabethan version of MI5. There is no account either of a 'poisoned dress' –security at court was very tight in such times and guards were constantly on the lookout for potential threats.The fact is that the story of Elizabeth I is so compelling without this embroidery – none of this salad dressing is really necessary. One of the best abuses of artistic licence is in the film U-571 – the Americans never captured an Enigma coding machine and yet the British captured two. What's the point in making the film then?The fact is that movie studios produce films for entertainment and think that historical works need to be embellished to make them more watchable. Yet this is nonsense – in Elizabeth's case the history is fascinating and with great actors such as Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Ecclestone and Sir Richard Attenborough, a true and accurate film about Elizabeth's reign would have been quite enough.Having said this, if you can ignore the multitude of historical inaccuracies and take the film on its own merits, the movie is well produced with great acting performances. Cate Blanchett is fabulous as Elizabeth and Joseph Fiennes is equally good as Dudley. Geoffrey Rush's portrayal as Francis Walsingham, however, is the stand out performance for me.The film is actually a doomed love story surrounding the friendship between Dudley and the Queen. This is quite true - in fact, the King of Spain was even quoted as saying that 'Elizabeth would never marry or will marry Robert Dudley because she loves him'. An interesting fact – Dudley played host to the Queen at Kenilworth Castle where, as part of the pomp, fireworks were used for the very first time in England.So to sum up, Elizabeth is a great film but chunks of it are not true. The sad part is that people watch films like this and believe everything they see. If historical inaccuracies bug you then this one may not be for you.Wake up movie makers - the truth is so much better than fiction.",6,0,0,20 May 2011
The Irishman," The Pensioners
","Bravo to Joe Pesci for being persuaded to come out of retirement for Martin Martin Scorsese's soon to be, new classic 'The Irishman'.Like many, I feared a bore-fest with a run time of 210 minutes and my goodness is this film long. And yet, it plays out like a good book - it's so fascinating at times that you just can't put it down. Scorsese has this unique ability to make a compelling film which could quite easily drift into a world of self-indulgence, and yet The Irishman never falls into this trap. Pesci is brilliant from the start, De Niro's star shines brightly again after several dubious outings and Pacino, as an often 'camp' Jimmy Hoffa, is a revelation.My only criticism of the film (and it's a tiny one) is that because the three actors are all in their 70s and the film delivers a series of flashbacks, CGI was used to make them look younger. Particularly in De Niro's case, he did look rather odd to me at times. A mob hit or a beating had the look of being perpetrated by a pensioner with a youthful face. But this minor detail which to be fair, was unavoidable, should not detract from the acting masterclasses on show here. With a stellar cast including Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano and Stephen Graham, the master of the mob genre is back with a bang.A big thank you to Netflix too - the big picture studios didn't fancy this one as it was considered a risk. It is apparent that an appetite for risk-taking is now being adopted by the new kids on the block and thank god they did.I look forward to Pesci receiving his Oscar for best, supporting actor next time around. He delivered a masterclass and his regular presence on the silver screen is sadly missed.",9,2,5,19 December 2019
Constantine," He can't act but who cares?
","Now let's be about right. Keanu Reeves is never going to win an Oscar or a BAFTA. Which is exactly why this film works so well.John Constantine is basically a bit of an arrogant arse which seems to suit Reeve's acting style for once. Short on expansive dialogue, emotion, light and shade, this film was made for him!! The plot is essentially based on a comic book (which I might add I have never read), so I have to judge the film it's own merits. And its a really great roller-coaster ride with some fine performances. Rachel Weiss is on top form as the police officer with a hidden gift (and an impeccable American accent). A very young Shia Le Bouef as Chas Kramer is quirky, geeky and at times very funny. But the stand out performance for me is Satan himself, Peter Stormare, hilariously sinister and scene stealingly brilliant.The plot is intriguing, the pace of the film is relentless and the special effects and action sequences are out of the top drawer. Add into the mix Tilda Swinton as Gabriel (and lets face it she does 'weird' better than anyone), a surprisingly good Gavin Rossdale as Satan's henchman Bathazar and the ever reliable Djimon Hounsou as Midnight and we are treated to a Gothic chiller which never lets up.Its the first and probably only Reeves film that I haven't wanted to see more acting panache from him. Because his appalling acting style actually fits for once. Which is why this movie is a winner.",9,2,4,17 September 2010
L.A. Confidential," Robbery at the Oscars
","The first time I remember a terrible Oscar Best Picture result was in 1988 when the excellent but schmaltzy Rainman, beat the far superior Mississippi Burning in most categories. A travesty of justice - surely it couldn't happen again? In 1997, it did happened again but this time it got a lot worse! Titanic got the thumbs up with its big budget and cute love story when in reality LA Confidential, a gritty film which is almost anonymous by comparison, should have walked it. Certainly one of the best and most intelligent films of the nineties by far, this movie included four of the best acting performances of the decade. Kim Basinger proved that she can act (and in doing so did get an Oscar), whilst a relatively unknown Australian Soap Opera Actor by the name of Guy Pearce waltzed onto the big screen for the first time and stole the show. Add to the mix, Russell Crowe as the cop who dishes out the beatings and the sublime Kevin Spacey and you get an intelligent American thriller right out of the top drawer.I saw this feel almost by accident as it was that poorly promoted and yet if I had a top 10, LA Confidential would be a 'must have'. Its like a drug - as the plot twists and turns the viewer is literally waiting for the next fix to arrive. And it does in spades.There are times when the Academy gets their selections correct. There are other times they get it catastrophically wrong. This is one of those times. Give an Oscar at the time to an unfashionable, unknown Australian who has graduated from Soap Land? - you can almost hear their screams!!",10,3,5,30 July 2010
Rush," An F1 Feast whether you like the sport or not
","I like my motor racing and was old enough to remember the Lauda / Hunt season of 1976 which captivated the sporting public. I was dubious about the epic battle coming to the silver screen and yet after watching it, concluded that I'd just seen the best motor racing film of all time.We have been in this territory before. Both Steve McQueen and Jack Lemmon have had a go and in recent years we've seen NASCAR as well. But none have come close in captivating the sense of romance, danger and sheer bravery of the two protagonists in question.So why does it work so well? For a start, watching Daniel Brühl as Nikki Lauda was like watching the great man himself. A dead ringer who portrays the great man impeccably and who is the very antithesis of Hunt, the flamboyant, heavy drinking womaniser and maverick. Hemsworth looks great - not a dead ringer for Hunt but good enough and his accent is perfect.Of course, anyone who knows their motor racing knows what happens in the end. But it is the journey that is taken, from Lord Hesketh privateering a young James Hunt in Formula Two where he first comes to race with his Austrian counterpart, to the 1976 F1 Season and the tragedy of that day at the Nurburgring.It would be easy to focus on the climax of the film with Hunt being the winner, after nearly losing the title with a double puncture. But it is Lauda who is quite rightly the hero. The crash, the horrendous rehabilitation, the shocking press conference, the fear at his return at Monza, and then retirement in the final race. To come back from those injuries in only 6 weeks and to come so close to another World Championship is testament to the bravery of the man who went on to become a racing legend.The film also pays a great tribute to Hunt, who whilst affectionately known as 'the Shunt', was far more than just the stereotypical playboy. By Lauda's own admission, Hunt was a highly skilled driver who was incredibly quick. He lived his life on the edge both professionally and privately. To lose the great man at the age of 45 from a heart attack was a tragedy in itself, especially as he had been sober for four years.Whether you like F1 or not is irrelevant. Rush is a brilliant true life story which is expertly crafted by Ron Howard. The race scenes are fantastically reproduced and the sound is epic. You are left under no illusion that these guys put their lives on the line every time they turned up at the track.Rush has been tipped for the Oscars and quite rightly so. You will not see a better acting performance than from Daniel Brühl and I hope that he receives the coveted golden statue as it will be well deserved.If you haven't seen the film give it a go. Its a fabulous story, has some truly comic moments at times (the broken down car scene is a belter!) but also drama, heartbreak and triumph. And it is the fastest two hours I've experienced at the movies for many years.",10,3,5,23 September 2013
Léon: The Professional," A French Cleaner with a difference...
","On paper, the plot line for this film is an absolute nightmare – controversial and even sick if handled by the wrong director. And yet Luc Besson conjures up an intricate, touching and taught thriller which ranks as a landmark piece of cinema.Leon is essentially a love story between a French hit-man (referred to as a 'cleaner') and a 12 year old girl whose family are brutally murdered by a monstrous DEA official come drug dealer (Gary Oldman). Leon (Jean Reno) is a meticulous assassin carrying out $5000 hits for the Italian underworld. He never actually gets paid as his boss Tony looks after his money for him (safer than a bank) though the reality is that he is being fleeced. He is socially and emotionally like a child – his simple life consists of drinking milk, watching Gene Kelly films, caring for a plant and sleeping upright in a chair with a gun by his side. He can't read and lives a solitary existence. His life changes when one day, a 12 year girl called Matilda (Natalie Portman) returns to the apartment building with some cartons of milk for him. As she walks past her own apartment to knock on Leon's door she sees that her family have been brutally murdered. In tears, she pleads with Leon to open the door, starting a relationship which ultimately ends in tragedy.Leon reluctantly takes Matilda under his wing and teaches her the skills of the expert hit-man because it's all he knows and over time they form an unbreakable bond.The film works for two simple reasons – Portman's pre-adolescent character means that she is too young to truly understand the implications of what she saying i.e. about love and sex. In Leon's case, he is in some ways even more of a child and therefore incapable of taking any sinister advantage of the situation. The result is a touching love story without any hint of perversity - their love is genuine but there is no hint of it crossing the lines of common decency. The controversial scene where Matilda asks to sleep with him was cut in the American screening and yet it is clear that Matilda doesn't really understand what she is saying nor does Leon have any intention of entertaining the prospect. The way in which they say goodbye to each other in what turns out to be the very last time is very much in the father daughter mould.Besson came up with Leon's character from a bit part Reno played in a previous film, La Femme Nikita , and the way Reno portrays Leon quite rightly turned him into an international movie star. His understated performance in direct contrast to the brashness of Matilda, is perfectly judged and the empathy you feel for his character is almost immediate.Gary Oldman's role is brutal, terrifying and wonderfully sinister. A glorious, over the top, drug fuelled nutcase with a passion for Beethoven. But it is Portman who steals the film and quite rightly so. When Luc Besson casted for the part of Matilda, he wanted someone young – somebody who did not understand the meaning of love. In her screen test, Portman was told the scene – that she is walking towards Leon's apartment when she discovers that her family including her 4 year old brother have been brutally murdered. She started to cry immediately – Besson had found her Matilda.It is amazing that Natalie Portman appeared in the awful Star Wars Prequels after a giving such a wonderful performance in Leon. There are very few child actors who could have delivered an acting master class like this – the only comparison I can think of is Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver. Even more remarkable, Portman had received little in actor training or experience before this film. During the making of the movie, the first time she had to be tearful, the crew used methanol to help her appear to be crying. She only used this once, as she was able to generate the emotion and tears by herself - quite a feat for an 11 year old girl.Fortunately, Natalie had very good parents who had certain control over the way she was used in the film. You never see Matilda draw on a cigarette and she gives up smoking later in the film. A planned shower scene where Matilda prances around naked was thankfully scrapped. Leon is a film of many complexities and one of the best thrillers I have seen personally. Whether you see it in the normal or Directors Cut version (the long version as Reno calls it), it's a must have. We must also hope that Besson writes a script for a new film, Matilda, so we can all see what happens to her character in the future. Portman has already stated she would do this at the drop of a hat, relishing the chance to work with Besson again – here's hoping.It is a magnificent piece of cinema.",10,7,10,24 June 2011
North by Northwest," War is hell, Mr. Thornhill, even when it's a cold one....
","The best 'mistaken identity' movie of them all, Hitchcock's masterpiece North By Northwest is a roller coaster ride from start to finish.Hitchcock originally wanted James Stewart to play Roger Thornhill and I'm convinced that with Hitchcock's direction we would have got much the same result. But Cary Grant is absolutely superb as the office exec who gets mistaken for George Caplan (who doesn't actually exist), and subsequently gets embroiled in a cold war plot where he has to fight to survive without having a clue what is happening around him.Grant plays his role with aplomb offering a mixture of anxiety, humour, sarcasm and disbelief. James Mason (Vandamme) is the man who wants Caplan dead and with his main henchman (an ice cold Martin Landau), they think they've achieved this by loading Thornhill up with Bourbon before getting him behind the wheel of a speeding car on a cliff top road. If only it were that easy. But Thornhill is a resilient man and after being framed for murder, looks to clear his name by discovering the truthNow Miss Kendall appears in the film, (Vandamme's mistress played by the excellent Eva Marie Saint) who leads you to believe that she has it in for Mr Thornhill but all is not what it seems.The plot twists and turns at relentless pace with a number of wonderful set pieces including crop dusting, Mount Rushmore and a hilarious confrontation in an auction room.But the crop dusting scene is the stand out moment and is where Hitchcock shows off his directorial genius. He makes great use of the landscape and the power of silence (intertwined with the odd car or bus noise) to leave you in no doubt that Thornhill is on his own. Then, in the distance, the faint, insignificant hum of a crop dusting plane emerges without giving the audience any realisation that this is actually the weapon Vandamme has chosen to rid him of his supposed adversary for good.Further twists include a fake shooting and the film culminates in the battle for survival on Mount Rushmore - epic stuff.North By Northwest is escapism at its very best and Grant plays the role in part for laughs which adds to the the movie's charm. His sarcastic sparring with Vandamme and Leonard, and his unashamed flirting with Eve all conspire to make a top notch thriller which you will want to watch again and again.It may not have the shocks as Psycho, the terror of the Birds, the taught tension and hopelessness of Rear Window. But as a thriller and piece of entertainment, this is one of Hitchcock's triumphs and gets a worthy 10 stars from me.",10,0,2,12 October 2012
Being John Malkovich," Why use a 500 word review when one will do?
","Rubbish...(Clever concept, yes, great cast yes, great film? Oh dear. I'm only typing now because I need 10 lines of text to be accepted. This is yet again a case where the critics dare not give a damning verdict just in case they are left with egg on their faces. Its like a bad Coldplay album - there's not many but when it is bad it still gets 10 stars through fear and not through any real substance. Its the same reason why eccentric Art lovers pay thousands of dollars for paintings which have been made by the artist throwing paint in front of an industrial fan and letting the colour spray randomly on the canvas. Clever yes, artistic merit - zero. Unfortunately, if enough people tell you that something is a masterpiece, there are plenty of suckers who are always going to believe it or certainly not have the balls to dismiss it. This is 2 hours of painful, pretentious, pointless drivel! I have nothing further to add your Honor.)",1,20,46,30 July 2010
The Usual Suspects," A real villain with menace who may not even exist!
","I'm posting here to have real good moan. Not at the film which is absolutely stunning but the moronic comments posted here.Point 1 - Gabriel Byrne's accent? A number of posts complain about Mr Byrne's stupid accent. It is an Irish accent. He is from Dublin. It is HIS accent!!Point 2 - I guessed the plot twist? No you didn't. Why do I say this? Because the vast majority of smart arses who say they guessed the plot twist hate the film. I think the reality is that these people feel some inadequacy about being duped and then not getting the twist at the end. Well I didn't get the twist and for me it made the film even more enjoyable. Just take it on the chin like I did.Point 3 - anyone of them could have been Keyser Soze? Sorry did I miss something? Keysor Soze could be the greatest movie villain of all time that doesn't even exist. Is Verbal Kint Key Soze? Or Kobayashi perhaps? The fact is we are left not knowing - Keyser Soze could be the most elaborate confidence trick of all time which adds to the films overwhelming charm.So why is The Usual Suspects so good? Whilst all the actors give a first class performance (Byrne's struggle between staying on the good side of the law or accepting what he is, Baldwin's psychotic lust for the big job or Spacey's persona as a loner and low life), for me Pete Postlewaite steals the film. Steven Spielberg has stated that he considers him to be the best character actor on the planet and here is a fine example of his work.Mysterious, sometimes sinister, lulling the 5 protagonists with an air of vulnerability stemming from his fear of not carrying out his masters orders, he probably only appears in the film for no more than 15 minutes and yet his presence is there throughout.The film isn't perfect (no film can rightly lay claim to perfection)but as an entertaining and engaging thriller its pretty damn close. So in summary, accept the film for what it is - a cracking yarn which ramps up tension about a monster gangster who may just be a figment of Kint's and Kobayashi's imagination. For me it's in the same class as LA Confidential as a 90's thriller par excellence.If you haven't seen it buy it - its a must have for your collection.",10,0,0,20 June 2009
Quantum of Solace," Do we want a return to the dark ages?
","I have only just watched the Quantum of Solace. I read much of the pre-release reviews and was suitably put off.Much of the review comments were fair - the messy and lacklustre plot, the absence of a credible villain and Daniel Craig and Judi Dench quite rightly, rescuing the film from turkey status.What is a alarming and concerning is the mainly stateside perspective that the film needs to have its fair share of stupid, inane one liners and crass character names. What next? - a Russian agent called Olga Getyapantsov? Onatop was bad enough!! And what new implausible gadgets do we want to see? A BMW that doubles up as a tank?The franchise should be applauded for going down a grittier more realistic track. Most Bond fans will gratefully acknowledge the early performances by Sean Connery, especially From Russia with Love with the cat 'n mouse encounter with Robert Shaw on the train. Riveting stuff. The only real technology on offer was a trick lock in a briefcase.Roger Moore then dumbed down the Bond legend so much that it became farcical. Pierce Brosnan did well to revive Bond's fortunes but there was still that tendency for shocking puns and gimmicks which reduced the films credibility and impact. For this reason, Casino Royale was a much awaited triumph.So what was disappointing about QOS?1. Editing - The fast, frenetic action scenes (ala Jason Bourne) have no depth of scale. They are incredibly difficult to watch. There are great stunts in QOS but their impact is lost in the jumpy nature of the camera work. Whilst this style of filming may be 'in' is it really Bond? I think not. A great example - the car crash in Casino Royale where the Aston catapults off the road. Spectacular and beautifully filmed. Was there anything as good in QOS? For all the hard work you are never left with that feeling of awe and splendour.2. Revenge Plot - Great idea with Bond as the tormented soul but the main protagonist is not actually our French Save the Planet CEO but Mr White and this vendetta was never resolved (although it might be in the next film). Much more could have been made of the CIA and even MI6 hunting Bond down as a rogue agent. A trick very much missed.3. Villainous Organisation - Who are they - they're everywhere but we have no idea who they are. And what are they after? Cornering the world's oil market? Nope - just depriving some Bolivians of their water supply. Hardly Spectre or Smirsh is it?4. Direction & Script - Marc Foster's direction doesn't cut it. The storytelling aspect of the film is badly handled, the script is weak and resorts to certain set pieces which merely attempt to paper over the cracks.5. Soundtrack - Dreadful!6. Bolivain Dictator Sub-Plot - pretty pointless in the scheme of things.7. Film Length The shortest Bond film of all. Like the producers ran out of ideas.In Conclusion: Not the worst by any means. But not nearly the best. Craig is a great Bond, and critics acknowledge this. What I hope for is that the creators keep their nerve and continue with this more realistic approach. If the franchise rolls back into more double-entendres, suggestive character names and Bond bedding any bird that crosses his path, then the whole premise of a top secret agent with a licence to kill will be lost. The days of Pussy Galore are long gone. The days of James Bond acting only with his eyebrows are long gone. The days of a secret agent approaching pensionable age sexually encountering young model type lasses are long gone. Making a James Bond film as a realistic, tense, action packed, edge of your seat thriller is now the order of the day. Casino Royale reinvented Bond, QOS has unfortunately tarnished its image once more. Let us hope that it is merely a blip and there are much better things to come.",6,2,9,14 June 2009
Hero," Definitely not zero but has its flaws
","I like this film - I liked it the first time I saw it and watching again on DVD has not diminished my enthusiasm.Firstly the positives. The film is beautifully filmed and steeped in Chinese history. The visual feast at times is stupendous and the set pieces are meticulously put together. The acting is top rate, the plot intriguing and the films sad yet triumphant end caps off a fine and engaging piece of cinema.So why not a ten? This film, like Crouching Tiger (over-rated bore fest) and House of Flying Daggers (will that women ever die at the end?) is just too stylised for me. As soon as I see Jet Li and his compatriots flying through the air and skipping off lakes I start to switch off. Whilst these films are fantasy offerings, and whilst the action sequences are well filmed, they are of course ridiculous. And that is its biggest flaw.Frankly the film, along with the others, just doesn't need these ridiculous artistic fantasy pieces to work. Hero plays out incredibly well on its own merits, with Li, dominating the film throughout. The fight scenes, rich cinematic content and evocative storyline is more than enough. The fantasy elements are almost comic book in comparison.Hero could quite easily have been a masterpiece if the director had backed away from the fantasy and put this film out as a historical epic.Not zero, but Hero? Not quite...",8,0,1,25 September 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Rita Hayworth & the Shawshank Redemption
","I never saw this film on the silver screen. I didn't want to see it on video either.The video store owner implored me to watch it and I remember my emphatic reply. 'I'm not watching a 3 hour film about a prison con doing tax returns for the guards'. Fortunately for me, this video store owner was a mightily persistent sort and I begrudgingly walked home not knowing that I had just rented the greatest film ever made.This film received no hype nor the mega-bucks publicity given to a lot of movie trash out there. Because they didn't need to - all they needed to do was to let people watch it because word of mouth is the best marketing ticket in town. And so it proved.The movie is long and relies on a storyline which has been covered many times. Wrongful conviction, brutality in jail, justice in the end. But it is the way in which the story is told and acted out that defines it, quite rightly, as IMDb's top ranked film.I don't care for Stephen King as an author but his vivid imagination coupled with his skill at telling a story (a short story in this case) is top drawer. We have a man (Dufresne) who after being convicted wrongfully for murder, uses his accounting skills in jail solely to survive. Red (Freeman), the man who can 'get things' befriends him. The story then slowly unravels with shocking scenes of brutality intertwined with flickers of how the human spirit can overcome the most hazardous odds. The Warden, Samuel Norton, is magnificent as a man whose corruption has spiralled out of control and will do almost anything to retain the status quo. Clancy Brown as the brutal guard completes the double act.The story twists and turns leaving the audience not quite knowing whether we are in for a harrowing or euphoric ending. And when the ending comes on that Mexican Beach you can almost hear the triumphant cheers ringing around the cinema halls.This is film making at its very best and it is highly unlikely that Robbins and Freeman will ever better it. Its one of those few occasions where 10 stars is not nearly high enough.So if you have been living under a rock or are as sceptical as I was in the early 90's, then it's time for me to adopt my friendly video store owners guise and say 'Watch this - its the best film ever made'.",10,2,3,5 August 2010
Tombstone," It can't be historically accurate but who cares?
","Right lets get the one negative out of the way. This film isn't and never could be historically accurate. So reviews applauding the historical content of this film are nonsense.The history of the Earps and Doc Holliday is shrouded in claim and counter claim based on the conflicting accuracy of eye witness accounts. No one truly knows who murdered Johnny Ringo, it could have been one of a dozen people including Johnny Ringo himself (as per the Coroner's report which indicated suicide). Doc Holliday could have murdered him but he was in court on the day although he may have been represented by his attorney. Guns were terribly inaccurate at the time and shooting whilst riding a horse was all but impossible. As in all shooting films both historical and modern, the ability to shoot with the accuracy of a laser is virtually nil (unless the shooter is a modern scoped Sniper of considerable skill). Nuff said.But as I mention in my summary, I couldn't care less!! This film is nothing short of magnificent. Val Kilmer gives a career defining performance as Doc which single handedly shamed the Oscar Academy (if there is a best supporting actor winner out there thats more worthy I would like to know). The relationship between Wyatt and Doc is compelling, with Wyatt as the honourable law abiding gunman vs his friend who is embroiled in a world of excess, drugs and death defying duels.Michael Biehn on the face of it, looked mis-cast as Ringo and yet delivers an understated and assured performance, Powers Booth is on top form as Curly, the Earp brothers all chip in, especially Sam Elliot who is always good value.The sets are lavish, the cinematography is breathtaking and the pace is perfectly balanced between rich story telling and stunning action set pieces. It would have been easy to make this film based around the climax at the OK Corral but not so - its almost a buddy movie, which is driven to conclusion at the private gunslinging showdown between Ringo and Wyatt.Personally, I would take this film any day over Unforgiven which whilst an excellent Western, never quite lived up to its own hype. Costner's Wyatt Earp doesn't hit the spot either. Tombstone definitely does.",9,3,4,30 July 2010
Blade Runner," Attack Ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion
","It must be quietly disconcerting for Ridley Scott that he directed his greatest film in the early 80's with the knowledge that try as he does, he will always find it difficult to improve upon. I watched this masterpiece of a film first time out and loved it from the start - in fact, it's not only my favourite sci-fi film but one of my favourites of all time. Whilst everyone is entitled to an opinion, I do find it laughable that some members of the IMDb community can give this classic a 1 star rating. Many conclude that the film does not live up to the expectations of the book. This of course is a nonsensical argument – the mental images derived from a book cannot be realistically compared to the reality of pictures on the silver screen. Everybody's interpretation is different. In other cases, the deep meaning and natural intelligence of Bladerunner appear to be too much for some. May I suggest these people look under the sections for Steve Seagal and Chuck Norris!These inane comments cannot detract from what is a groundbreaking piece of cinema. In a post apocalyptic Los Angeles where acid rain drenches the city from the gloomy sky above and people who can afford it search for the salvation of off world colonies, we enter the world of the Bladerunner – a specialist law enforcer tasked with the termination of human replicants who have turned 'rogue'.Not an easy task when considering that the human clones in question are difficult to distinguish from the real article. And in Rick Deckard's case (Harrison Ford), the task is to prove all the more difficult as the 'skinjobs' in question start to develop their own feelings and emotions for the first time.Bladerunner is a landmark film because unlike many sci-fi epics, it has stood the test of time. Made only 5 years after the original Star Wars film, the movie has aged incredibly well and looks as fresh and modern now as it did in 1982. More remarkably the film was made before the onset of computer aided graphics, which provides a fitting testament to how well this film is made. Star Wars: A New Hope looks dated – Bladerunner does not.The bleakness of the sets, the quirky dialogue and even quirkier film score by Vangellis, all add together to make a first rate sci-fi thriller which gets better the more times you watch it. Rutger Hauer provides the stand out performance as Roy Batty, the leader of the malfunctioning group, who is a ruthless killer by trade but famously shows compassion for the first time just before he dies as his emotions evolve.The film delves into a number of thought provoking topics including one which has troubled humanity since the beginning of time – how long have we got? Do you want to know or would you rather not? And in our world where genetic modification is raising questions in the medical sector, Bladerunner also poses this same question but some 20 years earlier. Regardless of whether you watch the original or Directors Cut version, this movie stands out as filmmaking of the highest calibre with a realism that everyone can identify with. Watch it in BlueRay for the experience this film deserves.Time to Die? In Bladerunner's case I think not. It'll still look good in 2111.",10,6,12,20 May 2011
Valkyrie," The Great German vs American Accent Swindle
","This could have been epic. We know the story. We know the outcome. We know the directors pedigree (Singer - Usual Suspects, X-Men fame).Great character actors with Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Kenneth Branagh and even Eddie Izzard. Stylish direction guaranteed. And I even like the title. So what's not to like.Two words - TOM CRUISE.What were they thinking? Yes Tom Cruise has major box office pulling power but he's not exactly RADA is he? Do you think if Gary Oldman had been given the part he would have played Stauffenberg in a British accent? In reality, Tom Cruise did not play this in a German accent because quite frankly, he couldn't. Does it matter? Yep it certainly does because credibility is lost as soon as he opens his mouth. And its such a monumental shame. Remember Ralph Fiennes in Schindlers List? Surely you can see the point? No matter how well Tom acts you always feel as if you've been left a bit short.There are so many actors out there that could have offered so much more to the part. Putting on an eye patch and delivering lines in ones own Syracuse accent is hardly an acting masterclass is it? Sorry Tom - you've made some decent flics but you should have given this one a miss.",2,5,10,21 June 2009
V for Vendetta," Utterly compelling - a thought provoking masterpiece!!
","Firstly, I must say how much it saddens me with regard to many of the quite frankly idiotic comments made about this wonderful film.Lets first take the charge of Natalie Portman's wooden acting. Her flawless English accent, her generation of power and emotion - quite rightly she was nominated for an Oscar. Then there is the case of the poor production quality - were these people watching the same film? The visual imagery of the the film at times is breathtaking. The opening sequence with the explosion at the Old Bailey to the finale of the 1812 Overture and the end sequence with the same set piece on the Houses of Parliament were spectacular. And all tied in with a wonderful piece of English History about the infamous Gunpowder Plot. Priceless!! This is exactly how films should be made - thought provoking which extract a meaningful debate. The moral dilemma as to how much power we should hand over to the state and whether a terrorist is indeed a terrorist or a champion of the people. The protection of civil liberties and the rights for everyone, whatever their creed or sexual persuasion, to be able to exercise free speech, and even more poigniantly, the role of propaganda in the control of the masses.I am not a political person, I'm not a student or an anarchist, I am just a normal average Joe who can see the power and intensity of a film that is a little too close to reality for comfort. Many of the comments made denouncing the film as trash are made by the very same people that the film eludes that we should be wary and fearful of.These film snobs will no doubt have given it a 10 star if it had been directed by Stanley Kubrick. I for one, see every film on its individual merits. Yes it slows a little in the middle, yes there may be a subtle hint of cliché from time to time but it is such a compelling tale with a 'now' factor that cannot be ignored.A must have in any DVD collection, V for Vendatta, taps into our social conscience and turns it on its head - BRAVO!!!!",10,4,14,10 May 2009
