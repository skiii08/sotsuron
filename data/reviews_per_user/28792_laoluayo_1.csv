The Avengers," Blockbuster for the ages....
","One of the lucky few to watch the film early. premiered here in Nairobi yesterday (27th of April) Didn't think it could be pulled off with all the characters in play but marvel did a great one on this.Iron man, hulk, captain America, Thor, black widow, hawk eye and Loki playing the villain.A number of very good match ups between the heroes... cool stuff.Story line was good, each hero had considerable screen time, Loki plays the villain role very well and all the characters came good.watching it again this weekend...Its gonna break d bank...",10,2,7,27 April 2012
