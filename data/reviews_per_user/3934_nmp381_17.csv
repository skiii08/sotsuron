The Blair Witch Project," Very Scary
","The Blair Witch Project has a such a dreary, isolating atmosphere. What made the movie work so well was the total isolation the 3 film students projected in the woods. The acting was very real and it made the movie  have a real life quality. Blair Witch leaves alot to the imagination, you dont ever see the witch in the movie, but you can feel its presence and its ability to scare. Whlie this is not the most scariest movie ever made, it ranks right up there.",8,0,1,14 July 2000
Requiem for a Dream," Severe and meaningful
","Requiem for a Dream revolves around four New Yorkers, who each get trapped in despair and horrifying drug addictions. Each have their own twisted logic behind their addictions, and must be seen to believed. The plot in itself is simple, but what makes this film so brilliant is the superb/realistic character depth, strong script, innovative score, impressive camera angles, and direction. Burstyn is amazing, and takes her character from shy/lonely person to speed addict obsessed with a TV show to new heights. Looking back she definitely deserved the Oscar for that year. The rest of the cast is solid-excellent. Each character wants to live some type of decent life, but the drugs keep pulling them back. The last 15 minutes of the movie, showing the demise of each character accompanied with the haunting soundtrack could be an example of some of the best film making ever.9/10. Graphic drug use, violence, strong sexual situations, nudity, strong language.",9,0,1,1 July 2002
Erin Brockovich," Best film of the year
","Erin Brockovich was a pleasant surprise. A great comedy/drama film. But what really made this movie so good was Julia Roberts, definitely one of her best performances in a movie. Roberts is funny, catchy and realistic in her role. The movie never becomes tired or boring in silly sub-plots, it is a straight foward solid story. 9/10. Roberts really shines in this role.",8,1,1,27 July 2000
Home Alone," An enjoyable movie, ONLY for the Holidays though
","Home Alone is certainly not the best comedy ever made, however it has to be one of the best Holiday films to watch. Culkin gives a funny, cute personality to his character. The mirror scene is a classic by now and its great fun to watch at Christmas with young kids. Only thing about this movie which holds it back, is that there's really no other time, other than Christmas where you'll want to watch Home Alone. The sequels should not have been made though, one time is enough of watching a young kid practically decapitate 2 adult robbers. 7.5/10",7,0,0,19 October 2000
The Shining," No need for the TV-series
","The original Shining form Stanley Kubrick was good, had flaws in it(some of the opening scenes were just filler and unneeded). Nontheless had memorable scenes and one of Jack Nicholoson's great performances, and one of the best acting psycho performances in horror. That is why movies like these do not need remakes(Psycho is another example). What made the first great was its originality, remakes just ruin the whole experience.",9,0,0,19 October 2000
The Exorcist," A SCARY CLASSIC
",The Exorcist is a truly disturbing scary movie about a young girl who is possessed by the devil and the battle her family and priests have to go through to get the evil out of her.It still scares to this day because the devil is portrayed very realistically in Linda Blair. Very frightening even after 27 years since its release.,10,0,0,26 February 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Alot of Fun to Watch
","MI2 was all purely entertainment from start to finish. The only actor that stood out or left an impression on me was Tom Cruise. He gave a good performance here. The opening sequence to the film, on the plane, was exciting and set the film up very nicely. The movie went down a little from there and wasn't able to pick up again towards the end. Thandie Newton also was underused in this movie, I felt she had alot more talent that was portrayed in this film. Overall the ending was jam packed with action, alot of it too far fetched, but still enjoyable. It deserves either a 6 or 7 out of 10.",6,0,0,27 July 2000
Pulp Fiction," Violent and to the point
","Pulp Fiction is perhaps one of the most acclaimed movies of the 1990's. What it has going for it is superb editing, direction, and story. Even amidst all of the action and swearing we see the lives of these hitmen and mobsters. The best sequences in the film are the Thurman/Travolta piece and the diner stick up. 8.8/10. Extreme profanity, violence, and drug use.",8,1,2,6 May 2002
Titanic," Excellent special affects
","Titanic is a good movie and has a touching love story of 2 young lovers (Leonardo Decaprio, Kate Winslet) aboard the doomed ship that sunk in 1912. One of the movies best aspects is the special affects and direction even though the love story drags on a little bit too long. Some of the acting had its ups and downs (Winslet and Billy Zane as  her rich fiancee are the best). The movie was too overhyped but still very good.",7,1,2,26 February 2000
Scream 2," pretty good follow up but falls short slightly
","Scream 2 was a solid sequel to the original. It equals the first movie in scariness and thrills. The acting falls short of the first film and it lacks originality. But the main problem with Scream 2 is that while it is a pretty good scary movie, it is ultimately forgettable and cannot stand on its own as a horror film.",6,0,0,15 July 2000
Jaws," Simply a Classic
","There's not much more to be said of 'Jaws' that hasn't been said already. The acting, music, style all fit to make this a great thriller/horror flick. For me the movie was more of a thriller than horror however it could work on both levels. This movie was definitely Steven Spielberg's peak in movie making, unfortunate the horrible sequels had yet to follow.",9,0,2,19 October 2000
Scream," Revived the genre
","Slasher movies had pretty much disappeared after the late 80s because they were all poorly written and acted and had become cliched. Scream came along and changed all that. A fresh look into slasher movies with a 90s trendy edge. While the movie was not really suspenseful it did deliver scare thrills and some exciting chases. The acting was also much MUCH better than alot of the 80s slashers and should become a classic, much like Halloween and Friday the 13th became, down the road.",7,0,0,15 July 2000
Halloween," ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES
","Halloween is one of the best horror movies for many reasons: excellent music,acting,directional style and camera angles. The plot is basic about Michael Myers who brutally murders his sister on Halloween when he is young and is locked away but escapes on Halloween night 15 years later and terrorizes his hometown of Haddonfield,Illonois. What makes this movie so great is that it is full of suspense and scares rather than gratuitous gore which most horror movies have. Halloween is a classic that ranks on top of other great horror movies such as The Exorcist and Psycho.",10,0,0,26 February 2000
The Silence of the Lambs," Best suspense movie of the 90s
","Silence of the Lambs has all the elements a movie should have to be a classic. Great acting, plot, and direction. Jodie Foster gave a memorable performance here and the confrontations between her and Lecter(Hopkins) was truly frightening and chilling. SOTL is well thought out and a classic of the 90s.",8,0,0,27 July 2000
Speed," The best action film. Spoiler on ending.
",Speed is an enjoyment from the minute the credits roll to the end scene where Bullock and Reeves just survived the train bomb. The movie is almost exhausting to watch but its definitely worth it because of solid performances from Keeanu Reeves and especially Sandra Bullock. Its unfortunate some of her current work can't be as good as this.,7,0,0,19 October 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Best Horror of the 80s
","Freddy Kreuger is probably one of the scariest and believable killers to appear ever since Michael Myers in Halloween. Original, frightning film that delves into your mind, Freddy haunting his victims in their dreams is truly frightning. Lagenkamps character is well thought out and believable similar to Curtis' character in Halloween. The only thing that hurts the film slightly is the poor ending and forgettable sequels. Far better than Friday the 13th and any other slasher films in the 80s.",9,0,0,15 July 2000
Casino," Excellent crime drama
","In Martin Scorsece's hit 'mafia' film, depicting the rise and fall of group of mobsters in Las Vegas. Rob Deniro and Joe Peschi give top notch performances as the lead mobsters running the Tangiers casino in Vegas. In the first half we are shown how Deniro's character tightly operates his casino. He knows all the tricks in the books that hustlers try to pull, however noone can pull a one up on this guy. Peschi is his hitman who does most of the dirty work, but is eventually banned from all casinos. Turning in a fiery, top notch (Oscar nomination) performance is Sharon Stone as a drug hustler who enchants Deniro one day as she shows up at the casino. They marry and he hopes to 'make' him fall in love with her one day, because her true love is a pimp (played by James Wood). Needless to say the last hour or so of this movie is vicious as we see the FBI crackdown on all the schemes the mobsters were trying so hard to hide in the casinos. Stone and Peschi, in particular have brutal demises. 9.3/10 extreme profanity, violence, and partial nudity. Excellent acting, direction, plot, and soundtrack. Only down side is the length of the movie, running well into above 3 1/2 hours.",9,1,1,5 May 2002
