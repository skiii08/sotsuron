The Blair Witch Project," What is overlooked.
","Much has been made of the inventiveness of the writer-directors who created this film, and deservedly so.  On the other hand, this is a film in which a misstep by any of the actors would have created the kind of false note that would have resonated through the whole movie, destroying it.  That this did not happen, at least for me, is a startlingly important thing.  I think this is one of the most gripping films I have seen in years, and I believe it marks a real marriage of concept and execution that the studios would do well to at least attempt to recapture.  Also, it would be nice if other big stars of the indie circuit (read Kevin Smith) could get some decent work out of their actors.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
