Iron Man 3," Why.......
","I'm going to get straight into this, this movie is essentially the kid that killed the mother (Avengers) when born and the father (Us) will never forgive them for. OK there is a few good points I liked that Tony Stark was Tony Stark in this movie, no Armour just him also TDKR done it better but there is a few in fact a lot of bad points, like how Pepper 'Dies' and like right after it Tony says something in a rather humours tone to Guy Pierce. I'm like at this point...'Your love of your life has 'Died' and you are full of grief and your like B**** PLEASE sorta way.The whole Mandarin Twist thing made me wanna spew all over the person in front of me I'm like you have made fun of the most memorable character in Iron Man he doesn't have any memorable villains and you crap all over his name. No it doesn't end there see Maya Hansen when she dies I'm laughing in the cinema because how essentially worthless she was. Also Yensid was there at the start as some sort of closure type thing which was totally unneeded. Also the plot was totally disjointed one minute Tennessee then Miami all for the sake of the plot. The Hulks transformation in Avengers made more sense than that.I liked the SFX it's good but not as good as some movies. I have seen quite recently.With Tony's whole surgery at the end was totally stupid when he was dying in the second one he could have got the surgery then but no it had to have some sort of end if you like.Also when the vice-president got arrested I thought what are the motives for this then after thinking I realised that when the president was supposed to die he was to be the next president because he wanted power. That should have been explained before or later in the movie.I gave this movie a four out of ten because I like Don Cheadle is a F****** and Gwyneth Paltrow is HOT. P.S Even though i find her hot I don't agree that she is the HOTTEST Woman on Earth.",4,8,16,29 April 2013
