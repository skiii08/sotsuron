Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I cannot believe I wasted my money on this movie.
","Hmm, that about says it all. I was so very disappointed that this movie was not better. George Lucas relied too heavily on CGI rather than actors. Don't get me wrong, the actors did well for the little parts they had, but it was not enough to keep me interested in this movie. I thought it dragged on and on and on, I was just waiting for the movie to pick up. Which it did a little in the end. The worst and most nasty and awesome bad guy that we have ever seen hardly has a role in this movie. Give me a break! We could have definitely used more of him. And I don't even want to go into Jar Jar Binds and his 'language'. I don't exactly appreciate going to see a movie and not being able to understand but three words every five minutes a character talks. There was no real story line behind this movie, and what little one it had was a little complicated to follow. All it was was George Lucas' way of saying 'look, I made another movie, go stand in lines forever and pay homage to me'.  But all in all, there is no way that TPM will ever live up to the reputation and the hype that was put before it. Maybe the same thing will happen with this trilogy that happened with the 1st. George Lucas will leave the writing to someone else for the next two.",10,0,1,19 May 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Not worthy of all that praise.
","Maybe it was just me. All I have heard of this movie is praise. I don't think it deserves all the attention it's getting. Don't get me wrong, I don't think it was bad, just not great.First of all the movie drags so much it's unbelievable. I'm also not a big Romeo and Juliet fan, so having two Romeo and Juliet type scenarios (the writing of the play and Shakespeare and Viola's doomed love) in the same movie did absolutely nothing to better my judgement of it.Just so you people don't think I'm all negative, there were some good parts. The emotion in the last part of the movie where it's evident that Shakespeare and Viola's love is doomed to fail, what can I say, I think it's the best scene I have ever seen. Very few movies make me cry, and that scene did the trick. There is a bit of humor, but most of it is dry humor.If I had had the choice, I would have rather seen this one on video.",Null,0,0,3 January 1999
