The Devil's Advocate," Give the Devil his due
","The Devil's Advocate is a film which is at times frustrating to watch. It's a movie of fits and starts, never really able to sustain its momentum over the entirety of its clearly bloated running time of almost two and a half hours. A couple of the key performances leave something to be desired. Keanu Reeves is rather stiff and unnatural but that's what you're going to get out of Keanu Reeves. In what was one of her first major roles Charlize Theron never seems entirely comfortable. She's not bad by any means but it's definitely not the kind of assured performance we would see from her later on in her career. The one key player you can't really find fault with is Al Pacino who does have the advantage of playing a role which is absolutely tailor-made for him. You worry that it's a part which may open itself up to the yelling and screaming and histrionics which have marked much of Pacino's later works. But here he plays things with much more calm and subtlety. At least until the climax when there are in fact plenty of histrionics. But for this character at that point in the movie it works. So no complaints there. And by that point the movie could use a little injection of life as things do begin to drag. Even as Pacino begins to go gleefully over the top there's the sense that things are a bit talky. You'd like to see less words, more action. But it works well enough and when the story completes its final twists there's a sense of, at the very least, satisfaction. You haven't seen a great movie but it pulls itself together enough to be deemed a success.The story, which again could use some serious trimming as the movie goes on much too long for its own good, follows small-town Florida lawyer Kevin Lomax who has never lost a case. He is recruited by a major New York law firm so he and his lovely wife relocate to the Big Apple where we see very quickly that things are not necessarily what they seem. The head of the law firm is named John Milton and yes that name should start the alarm bells ringing. Something about this guy isn't right. Who exactly is Milton? Well that's the film's big secret, although if you've seen any of the film's promotional materials it's really not much of a secret at all. Anyhow, Lomax continues to have success but there's always the sense that Milton's pulling all the strings in the background. The interactions between these two characters are critically important and that's one of the film's bigger problems. Because Pacino, playing Milton, is so far and away a better actor than Reeves, playing Lomax, the relationship comes off as incredibly one-sided. Pacino totally owns these scenes and seeing as it's the Reeves character who's set up as the hero of the piece that's problematic. In fact Reeves always comes off second best no matter who's acting opposite him. Jeffrey Jones, Connie Nielsen, Craig T. Nelson...they all get a chance to outshine Reeves and they do just that. Eventually you just have to throw up your hands and say, 'Well, that's Keanu' and move on. His interaction with Theron, playing his wife, works somewhat better so give him a little credit for that at least.Despite its faults there is much to recommend The Devil's Advocate. It's a smart story, with lots of sharp twists and turns. The production design and visual effects are outstanding, it really is a spectacular looking movie. For whatever quibbles you may have with Reeves the rest of the cast is generally very good. Pacino's the obvious standout but there are plenty of supporting players turning in fine work as well. Yes the movie goes on too long but at least it finally arrives at a satisfying destination. You get the sense the movie could have been a little better, especially if there was a lead actor better equipped to stand toe to toe with Pacino. But ultimately it works well enough to be worth your while.",7,1,2,21 October 2010
The King's Speech," A kingly performance
","Playing the stammering King George VI would seem to be an incredible challenge for an actor. Colin Firth proves more than up to the task, turning in a quite remarkable performance. King George, or Prince Albert as he was at the start of this film, had no voice. Words remained hopelessly stuck in his throat, a tremendous problem for a royal who in the new modern age of radio would be heard by an entire empire. When that microphone turns on there is nowhere for Albert to hide. Perhaps a lesser royal could withdraw, lead a quiet life of solitude. A king does not have this option. He was never supposed to be king but when his brother gives up the throne Albert is front and center, the new King George VI, a man who must speak to and inspire his people as they head into war. And the poor man can not speak at all.Firth, guided by director Tom Hooper, does such an excellent job portraying the stammering prince who would become an inspiring king. There was a fine line to be walked with how exactly to portray the stammer. Go too far with it and the film might be unbearably uncomfortable to watch. Don't go far enough and the events of the film will seem nowhere near as consequential as they should. Firth gets it just about perfectly right. There are moments where it is a little bit uncomfortable. But that's kind of the point. This was a painful affliction for Albert to live with and at times it was truly painful for anyone who had to listen to him. This is never more evident than in the film's opening scene, in which Albert gives his first big, public speech. It goes terribly. He is embarrassed. Everyone listening is embarrassed for him. Enter Lionel Logue.Geoffrey Rush plays Logue, Albert's speech therapist. Firth and Rush prove to be a winning combination, they play off one another so well. Albert's frustrations mount, his temper often boils over. But Logue is always there to guide him forward. In this test of wills commoner Logue will prove to be just as strong as the man who would be king. It's a sort of buddy film but one with serious consequences. Albert's brother, David, ascends to the throne but he's not long for the job. Crisis of his own making causes David, who clearly was never going to be much of a king anyway, to step down. Albert is now king. And the new King George VI needs Lionel Logue more than Prince Albert ever did.The film, as most films of this sort do, takes some liberties with some historical facts but the gist of the true story shines through. And it really is a remarkable story. An inspiring story too, and so well performed by the two key players, Firth and Rush. There are notable performances as well from Guy Pearce and Helena Bonham Carter. Pearce plays David, the man who is ever so briefly King Edward VIII. Burdened with a responsibility he does not want, and obsessed with a love which is forbidden, David is a tough character to play. Pearce does well to make you feel sympathy for him when appropriate and to make you want to punch him in the face when that is appropriate. Carter plays Albert's ever-supportive wife, a woman who is a rock he can always lean on. An easy character to love. Pearce, Carter and other supporting players add a great deal to the proceedings. Notable are a few nice moments sprinkled in with the king's young daughters, one of whom, Elizabeth, has quite a future ahead of her. But of course the film is really all about King George VI and Lionel Logue. And in playing those roles Firth and Rush elevate the whole film. While it is certainly a compelling story it is not the liveliest thing you've ever seen. There are times it is somewhat slowly paced, times things seem a little mundane. But you know the stakes. The king has to find his voice. A nation, an empire, depends on it. It was such a struggle for the king. Firth brilliantly brings that struggle to life. The King's Speech is, if not a tremendous film, certainly a very good one. Firth's performance? That most certainly is tremendous.",7,0,0,20 April 2015
The Mask," Not smokin'
","The Mask is a movie which certainly has some positive things going for it. But there are plenty of things working against the movie too. In the end it all balances out to leave us with a movie which isn't great but isn't terrible either. There are some good things to appreciate but not enough of them to prevent the movie from ultimately being somewhat disappointing.The story follows shy, luckless, dorky Stanley Ipkiss. An ordinary guy. Ordinary that is until he finds an ancient wooden mask which when he puts it on transforms him into a wacky, green-headed superhero. He's a crazed whirling dervish with all kinds of wonderfully exploitable powers. He's got speed, he's got strength, he seems indestructible. And he can conjure anything he wants out of thin air. Stanley's luck is about to change. Now he can exact revenge on his tormentors. And he can get the girl. Yeah, there's always a girl.This is a seemingly perfect movie for Jim Carrey, enabling him to just go nuts. A guy like Carrey can have a lot of fun with something like this. Which makes the fact that the movie so often seems devoid of fun rather puzzling. Oh, Carrey surely has his moments. But somehow, even with the bundle of energy that is The Mask at its heart, the movie often is a little dull. Too much dead space between Carrey's best moments. And while Peter Greene does fine in playing the movie's main villain Dorian Tyrell the rest of the bad guys leave a lot to be desired. You don't expect the actors playing the thugs in a movie like this to all be little Brandos and De Niros but is it so much to ask that the actors at least be competent? No such luck, it's strictly amateur hour with these guys. Some truly cringe-inducing acting. Everyone involved, from Carrey on down, is not helped by a script heavy on puns which are very hit and miss. Carrey is so manic that he can make most things work and at least extract a mild chuckle from the audience. Other performers aren't so fortunate.The film has its good pieces. The visual effects are undeniably terrific, the film looks great from beginning to end. Carrey does an admirable job bringing his crazed character to life. And there is one thing about the movie which is indeed 'Smokin!' That would be Cameron Diaz. She plays the aforementioned girl for whom Stanley longs. To say Diaz is a jaw-dropper in this, her film debut, doesn't even begin to do her justice. And besides looking ridiculously, impossibly gorgeous she shows she can actually act too, so that's a nice bonus. You've got Carrey, you've got Diaz, you've got a decent lead villain and those dazzling effects. But it doesn't all quite add up. The story lets down the movie. It's not consistently funny enough and there are times where the story really struggles for any momentum at all. At times, too many times, things are rather mundane. And mundane is not what you're looking for when you turn Jim Carrey into a whirling dervish superhero.",5,1,8,18 February 2011
Whip It," Director Drew does very well
","Having been involved in movies all her life Drew Barrymore finally gets the chance to direct one. And she does a very good job. Whip It is not any kind of all-time classic movie. But it is very entertaining and enjoyable. Barrymore draws out excellent performances from her cast, most notably the undisputed star of the show, Ellen Page. With Page in the lead role there's a temptation to call this Juno on Skates. But while Whip It does at times have an unmistakable Juno vibe this movie manages to differentiate itself, to stand on its own two feet. It has an energy all its own.You have to give Barrymore credit for the way she immerses us in the rather bizarre roller derby world. Maybe most people are aware of roller derby but how many people really know anything about the sport, how it even works? Barrymore quickly makes sense out of the chaos, explaining the rules of the game without dragging the movie to a screeching halt. And once we actually understand what's going on the fun can really begin. And there is plenty of fun to be had in this story of the rollicking roller derby girls and the newcomer to the sport who is determined to be her own hero.While Barrymore deserves due credit for her directing work the movie is largely Page's to carry and she is certainly up to the task. Sweet young beauty pageant contestant Bliss Cavendar, who shows up to roller derby tryouts in Barbie skates, is transformed into Babe Ruthless, star of the Hurl Scouts. What a thrilling journey for Bliss and Page captures the character's evolution perfectly. For as good as Page is you do wish we got to spend a little bit more time with some of the other roller girls. Eve and Zoe Bell are given practically nothing to do with their roles. Barrymore understandably was focused on her work behind the camera but that means her on-screen character, Smashley Simpson, gets a bit of the short shrift. Smashley seems to have great personality, and great potential as a character, but we only get fleeting glimpses. The only one of the Hurl Scouts aside from Babe Ruthless to get any significant attention is Maggie Mayhem, played by Kristen Wiig. She acts as somewhat of a surrogate mother to Bliss whose real mother, though well-intentioned, leaves much to be desired in the way she raises her daughter. Marcia Gay Harden plays Bliss's mom and she has some very good moments along with Daniel Stern as the dad. There has to be a roller derby villain and Juliette Lewis does very well with that role. Alia Shawkat as Bliss's best friend and Jimmy Fallon as the wildly enthusiastic derby announcer are also very good. And perhaps the best supporting performance comes from Andrew Wilson as the exceedingly eccentric coach of the Hurl Scouts. Who even knew roller derby had coaches?From Page on down everyone in the cast plays their parts very well. You have to credit Barrymore for that. Then again, she should know acting right? But she also shows a keen visual sense, especially when she gets us right up in the middle of the thrilling derby action. At times the movie seems very predictable. You've seen plenty of coming-of-age movies like this one. You've seen plenty of sports underdog movies like this one. But while the movie does play out in an at times very familiar fashion there are a few curveballs, some pleasant surprises, thrown in. You may think you have the movie completely figured out but maybe you don't. All in all, it's a very promising directorial debut, a movie which leaves you with a smile on your face and looking forward to what Barrymore might do next.",7,0,3,16 July 2011
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Seems like we've been here before
","Time for the inevitable National Treasure sequel and your feelings about this movie should pretty much reflect your feelings about the first one. If you liked the original you'll like this. If the first movie didn't do it for you well then there's nothing for you here because it's basically the same movie all over again. It's a pretty simple formula really. Take a movie which made hundreds of millions of dollars, add a couple of European locations, toss in a dash of Ed Harris and a dollop of Helen Mirren and then sit back and collect further hundreds of millions of dollars.The sequel does on the surface seem slightly more plausible than the original but that's really not saying much. Our heroes won't have to steal the Declaration of Independence this time. But they will have to take apart the Queen of England's desk, sneak into the Oval Office and kidnap someone who quite simply cannot be kidnapped. And of course they'll also need to get their hands on the Book of Secrets because that is after all the name of the movie. What's in that Book of Secrets? Well, it's a secret. But it's safe to say there will be more treasure to be found because apparently we didn't discover enough treasure in the first movie. I anxiously await National Treasure 50 by which point I'm sure we will have learned that you can find billions of dollars worth of gold buried somewhere in each of the fifty states if only you have Nicolas Cage to help you look for it.Cage of course plays the central role of treasure hunter Ben Gates and he's surrounded by much of the same cast as last time around. Jon Voight again plays Ben's father, Diane Kruger his love interest and Justin Bartha his treasure-hunting sidekick. Cage, Voight and Kruger are really no better or worse than the first time around. Bartha's character is much less annoying this time. After trying so desperately hard to be funny, and failing miserably at it, in the first film the character fits much better in this movie. All of those groan-inducing one-liners Bartha was forced to spout in the first movie have been removed. Well, most of them anyway. The two new roles of any significance are taken up by Harris as the villain and Mirren as Ben's mother. Harris is somewhat surprisingly bland in his bad guy role. Adding Mirren was a nice touch however and she plays off of Cage and Voight very well. The fact Ben's mother happens to be one of the few people on the planet capable of interpreting one of the clues is either convenient or contrived, I'm not quite sure which.Anyhow Ben Gates and friends proceed pretty much exactly as they did in the first movie. Decipher some clues, avoid the bad guy, decipher some more clues, avoid the bad guy again, try not to get killed by ancient treasure-protecting booby traps. It really is the same exact thing we saw the first time. But that's not all bad. The plot is reasonably engrossing and entertaining. There are some nice action moments, some decent touches of humor here and there. It's a movie that was never meant to be taken particularly seriously. For what it is it works. More or less.",6,0,0,28 May 2009
Angels & Demons," It could have been worse
","Well at least they didn't make a complete mess of it like last time. Director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman previously combined for the film adaptation of Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code. The film was a total dud. A thrilling, exciting novel was transformed into a dull, plodding movie. Howard and Goldsman, with a second screenwriter in David Koepp along for the ride this time, try again with their adaptation of Brown's Angels & Demons. This time the film is not a total dud but it's certainly not all you would hope for it to be either. Once again it is clear that the book is better than the movie. A lot better.Tom Hanks, with a much better haircut this time, returns to the role of Robert Langdon and Hanks certainly seems more comfortable here than he did in his first Langdon adventure. Hanks as Langdon works fine, it's everything around the film's star which is hit or miss. Where the last film got bogged down with a lot of talk and historical information this film has a much better pace to it. Less talk, more action. So that's good. But in all the breakneck action, with Langdon scurrying to and fro across Rome, a lot of the original story from the novel has been lost. That's not so good. If everything from the novel had been included here we'd probably be looking at a movie that's five hours long. But some of the cuts which were made have cut a lot of the heart out of the story. There's really not much in the way of story left. It's just a frantic race against time and while there is certainly some excitement to be had you never find yourself nearly as invested in the story or the characters as you did when reading the novel. There were personal connections in the novel which added layers of emotion to the story. Here that emotion has been stripped away and what we're left with is just another action thriller. And the novel was so much more than that.The Da Vinci Code film had very little to recommend it, that's not the case here. Angels & Demons is passable entertainment. Hanks is much better this time around and he's supported well by some fine actors. Ewan McGregor as the Camerlengo and Stellan Skarsgård as the head of the Swiss Guard stand out as being particularly memorable even as their characters have undergone some radical transformations from what Dan Brown put down on the page. Ayelet Zurer is fine with what she is given to do in the role of Vittoria Vetra. You just wish they would have given her more. In the novel Vittoria was a critically important character with a hugely significant role in the plot. Here it seems she's just along for the ride and that's a shame. The look of the film is undeniably impressive, as Rome beautifully comes alive. Even the parts of Rome which were brought to life on a California back lot. It's an exciting film, we're given very little time to catch our breath as we race to what promises to be an explosive conclusion. There again you'll probably feel the book's ending works a lot better than the movie's does. But by that point you're resigned to the fact that Ron Howard's movie just wasn't going to measure up to Dan Brown's book. Someone who never read the novel could really enjoy this film for what it is. Those who read the novel can't help but be a touch disappointed, knowing what this film could have been. But this film is certainly better than The Da Vinci Code was. So that's something I guess. Better luck with The Lost Symbol, Ron.",6,0,0,22 March 2010
Vertigo," Act 1: Ho-hum. Act 2: Wow! Act 3: Ho-hum.
","One gets the idea that Vertigo was probably one of M. Night Shyamalan's favorite films growing up. A rather ordinary film meandering along until, Bam!, the big twist that pulls you up out of your seat, puts a new spin on everything which has come before and leaves you dumbstruck by how brilliant the whole thing was. But whereas Shyamalan had the good, for lack of a better word, sense to end The Sixth Sense right after the big twist, in Vertigo the big twist is stuck in the middle somewhere and by the time the film finally wraps up the impact of that big moment has been lost. The shock, the sense of wonder and amazement, all wears off as you watch a prolonged end to the film which is rather dull and drawn-out...kind of like the whole first half of the movie.Vertigo tells the story of San Francisco police detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson, played by James Stewart. Forced to retire when afflicted with, what in his line of work, is a crippling case of vertigo, Scottie takes on one last case as a favor to an old acquaintance. He is hired to follow this man's wife, Madeleine. Played by Kim Novak, Madeleine may be a little bit crazy, appearing to be, or at least believing to be, possessed by the spirit of a long-dead woman. Scottie follows Madeleine around and after watching a number of much too long sequences which consist entirely of something along the lines of 'Madeleine driving her car turns left, now Scottie following behind her turns left, now Madeleine turns right, now Scottie turns right...' you may well find yourself saying 'Get on with it already!' Eventually the story (rather than just the cars the characters are driving) takes a few twists and turns but never really seems to get moving. And then comes the big twist, what is seemingly the ultimate payoff for all the rather humdrum stuff that has come before. But then it's straight back to the humdrum stuff and quite a bit more of it too. Nobody would ever seriously question the genius of Alfred Hitchock, but in this instance, it seems he just didn't have the good sense to simply let this film end. It starts out simply OK, for a fleeting moment promises to be something spectacular, but then ends up back at simply OK. Not a bad movie by any means, but you get the sense it could have been so much more.Playing against type, more anti-hero than hero, Stewart does a pretty good job with what he has to work with. Unfortunately, for much of the film there really isn't much of anything for him to do. There's only so much an actor can do with entire scenes which require him to do nothing but stare through a car windshield. As Madeleine, Novak is somewhat cold, icy and detached but she has to be for the character she plays. How good her performance really is cannot be appreciated until the full story is revealed. It must have been a very difficult role to play and she pulled it off wonderfully. The other seemingly significant character is Scottie's old friend Midge, played by Barbara Bel Geddes. But in the end it turns out maybe she wasn't so significant after all as she simply disappears as the final act plays out, another frustrating note in what can be a really frustrating film. There's a good story here and some moments of true suspense. There's fine acting, most especially by Novak in her truly challenging role. And there's that big twist which for a moment promises to pull the whole thing together into a wonderful package. But the moment passes and what we're left with is a good movie which you get the feeling could have been truly great but fell just short of the mark.",7,0,2,17 April 2006
Black Swan," Losing yourself
","Natalie Portman plays Nina, a ballerina in a prestigious New York City company. Nina's toiled away for years, perfecting her craft. She's come a long way, had plenty of success. But she's never made the big breakthrough, never been the lead, the big star. She needs that validation, she's desperate for it. Thomas, the director of the company, announces they will be doing Swan Lake. Nina will get her chance. It's now or never. She needs this part, she needs to be the Swan Queen. Her life is nothing if she fails. The good news is that Nina is absolutely perfect for the part of the innocent, virginal White Swan. The bad news is it's a dual part. Whoever gets the part also has to play the dark, sensual, evil Black Swan. And for this half of the Swan Queen role Nina is all wrong. Can she summon up the darkness inside her? And if she can what will be the cost? Losing herself in this role may well cause her to lose her mind.Thomas knows Nina has the dancing talent to be the Swan Queen. She's up to the task physically. But mentally? Emotionally? That's something else altogether. This sheltered girl, hovered over her whole life by her very, very overprotective mother, has no life experience to draw on to be the Black Swan. Thomas needs her to attack the role but she doesn't know how. Nina's a perfectionist, obsessed with getting all her movements just right. She won't, or can't, allow herself to be swept away, to lose herself in her performance. As an example of what Nina needs to be there is the new dancer in the company, Lily. Everything comes easily to Lily. She's not technically perfect. But she makes dancing look effortless. She connects with the material and the audience in a way Nina can't. Lily is the perfect Black Swan. Thomas sees it. Nina sees it. If Nina is going to be the Swan Queen she'd better find her dark side in a hurry.Becoming the Black Swan is going to require Nina to go to previously uncharted areas of her mind. She's willing to do whatever it takes but she really has no idea of the terribly dark places this might take her. We watch Nina begin to unravel right before our eyes. She's losing it and Portman portrays this wonderfully. A breathtaking performance, helped no doubt by director Darren Aronofsky who captures the descent into madness beautifully. Aronofsky employs some clever visual tricks along the way, notably making wonderful use of all those mirrors ballerinas are constantly studying themselves in. Aronofsky takes us right inside Nina's mind and it turns out that is a very scary place to be. The sweet, young girl we saw in the film's beginning disappears. The Black Swan consumes her. The film isn't perfect. There is a temptation to say that as Nina loses her grip on reality Aronofsky loses his grip on his film. Things do seem to get away from him just a bit in the end. But it's still powerful, fascinating stuff. A great story, performed wonderfully by a stellar cast. Portman obviously gets the lion's share of the attention and deservedly so. She's fantastic from beginning to end in a role that was exceptionally demanding both physically and emotionally. But she's not alone in her brilliance. Vincent Cassel is terrific as Thomas, the man desperately trying to draw the Black Swan out of Nina. Barbara Hershey is the well-meaning but ultimately rather monstrous mother who refuses to let Nina grow up, to truly live. Hershey plays the part perfectly. Winona Ryder has a small but important role as an aging ballerina being pushed aside and Ryder makes the most of every moment she has. Then there's the real revelation, Mila Kunis. She plays Lily and she is stunning in every sense of the word. Very few would have guessed Kunis had something like this in her. Full credit to Aronofsky for giving her the chance. She surely made the most of it. For as good as all the supporting players are there is no doubt this is Portman's show. And she turns in a performance for the ages. Nina is transformed. Portman is too. People will always look at her differently now. She's not just a cute, popular movie star anymore. She's an actress of the highest caliber. Black Swan may not be a truly great movie, but it's a very good one. If greatness eludes the movie it doesn't elude Portman. The performance she turned in here is as good as it gets.",7,1,2,4 June 2011
Changeling," Fascinating story, less fascinating movie
","Here is a story which would be impossible to believe if it weren't actually true. In Los Angeles in 1928 a nine-year-old boy, Walter Collins, goes missing. Months later he is found and the LAPD sets up a triumphant, highly publicized, reunion between Walter and his mother Christine. There's a problem. Immediately upon seeing the boy Christine knows that this is not her son. Desperate for good press the LAPD is quick to hush Christine up and prods her to take the boy home on a trial basis. Seriously, that's what they said. Take him home, try him out, maybe you'll like him. Christine has little patience for this charade. She continues to insistently state the obvious. This boy is not her son. She wants answers. What she gets is a one-way ticket to the psychopathic ward.On the surface the movie appears to be about one woman's fight for the truth, her fight for her son. It's also about the incompetence and corruption of the LAPD and director Clint Eastwood unfortunately hammers that angle to death. The LAPD of this time was full of bad, vile characters. We get it. As the cliché of the big, bad police department gets beaten into the ground there has to be the other corresponding movie cliché. That would be the one good, honest cop who wants to get to the bottom of things. And in this case getting to the bottom of things takes the movie to some very dark and horrifying places.The story of the missing Walter Collins ties into a bigger picture storyline. That bigger picture is too awful to even want to contemplate. Here give Eastwood some credit. He didn't exploit the horror. He chose to stick closely to the story of Christine Collins, her quest to find her son and her battles with the LAPD. Eastwood gives us enough information to realize the awful nature of what has been done and to understand the sick, twisted evil of the villain who is introduced into the film. But at its heart the movie is always about Christine Collins. This was a brave woman who, faced with so many obstacles, never wavered in her quest for the truth and never lost hope of being reunited with her Walter. That makes for a great story but there are too many nagging issues here to make this a truly great movie.Angelina Jolie gives a highly-charged performance in the role of Christine. But there are times she goes a little too far. Obviously there are tremendous emotional highs and lows in Christine's story but when Jolie lays it on a bit thick the effect is jarring. One scene near the end is most notable, Jolie hamming it up to such an extent it takes you out of the movie entirely. All you're thinking is 'Angie dear, come back to us.' Many of the supporting characters fall flat, most notably Christine's main LAPD adversary, Captain Jones. He's a bland, boring, rather ineffectual foil for Christine. John Malkovich, playing well against type as a radio preacher, and Jason Butler Harner as the exceedingly eccentric villain have their moments. But other than that it's Jolie's show all the way. And her performance doesn't quite sustain the movie over a rather excessive 140 minute running time. Eastwood's relentless hammering of the LAPD wears thin rather quickly. Yes, the police in this true-life story were corrupt and incompetent and pretty much completely awful. But Eastwood belabors the point to at times tedious effect. All in all, for as fascinating a story as there is to work with, there is the sense the movie never fully ignites. It simmers but never boils. A reasonably decent film but clearly not one of Eastwood's best efforts.",6,2,3,13 March 2012
Walk the Line," Good film, two great performances
","If ever there were a case of two performers taking over a film and making it their own this is it. Walk the Line is elevated by two of the most brilliant performances you could ever hope to see from Joaquin Phoenix as the legendary Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, Cash's partner on stage and eventually offstage as well. The love Johnny Cash and June Carter had for one another was legendary and the performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon more than do their story justice. The story of Johnny and June is a great one and it's told pretty well in this film. The film takes a little while to really get going, showing Johnny's troubled childhood and his struggle to launch his music career. The film doesn't really take off until Johnny and June come together. There are still some lulls after that and some tough, painful moments as well as Cash's terrible addictions are honestly and at times rather brutally displayed. But throughout the brilliance of Phoenix and Witherspoon is constant. They are terrific in portraying the great love their two characters had for one another and also brilliantly express the frustrations they would have with one another as their relationship progressed in fits and starts. And where Phoenix and Witherspoon really shine is on stage as, yes, they do all the singing themselves. In this area Phoenix in particular is simply mesmerizing. In look and sound he is so believable on stage as Johnny Cash it is downright eerie. Close your eyes and you would be forgiven for thinking you were listening to Cash himself.As wonderful as Phoenix and Witherspoon are the film does struggle at times to keep the story moving. You get the feeling there could have been ten minutes or so trimmed out that wouldn't have been missed and that would have helped the film maintain a more constant energy. When it's good, this film is very, very good but there are too many moments when the story drags. The filmmakers take great pains to make sure we really get to know Johnny Cash but there are definitely some scenes which could have been shortened or eliminated altogether without taking away from our understanding of who Johnny Cash really was. By the end of the film it is obvious this is not just Johnny's story but the story of Johnny and June together and in retrospect it seems the film was just killing time until the two leads could be brought together. Other performances, including Ginnifer Goodwin as Johnny's first wife and Robert Patrick as Johnny's father, are fine and their roles are important in establishing why Johnny Cash became the man that he was. But this movie clearly belongs to Johnny and June, Phoenix and Witherspoon. Walk the Line is certainly a good film. If you feel it is something special it will have been the performances of Phoenix and Witherspoon which will have made it so.",7,0,0,9 August 2006
Alien 3," What a mess
","In addition to being a quite terrible movie Alien³ also manages to completely undercut the legacy of the previous films in the series. If you liked Aliens, and were happy with the way that film ended, you certainly won't want to watch Alien³. The very first thing this movie does is completely ruin the ending of Aliens. Whose bright idea was that? Heaven only knows whose idea that really was as there were so many people who had a hand in producing this awful film. With so much studio interference director David Fincher never had a chance. This film was always going to be a mess. No wonder Fincher would ultimately disown the film. It's not his film. It's nobody's film. It's just a bunch of disparate ideas, most of them terrible, slapped together to produce two hours of misery.Since I was not particularly a fan of the first two Alien films I don't find this one as much of an insult as I imagine fans of the series would. You don't really have to take in the whole scope of the Alien series to understand just how awful this movie really is though. Taken on its own merits...well, actually it has no merits. There is really nothing good to say about this movie. Maybe if you're being generous you could say it provides a decent resolution to Ripley's story arc. But what a painful slog it is in getting to that resolution. No excitement, no drama. The story is weak, the dialogue is laughably bad, the performances are by and large terrible. Sigourney Weaver again has some nice presence to her as she reprises the famous role of Ripley. But everything which surrounds her disappoints. The flimsy story sees Ripley land on a penal colony inhabited by all-male inmates with a history of extreme physical and sexual violence. Not a great place for a woman then. But wait, these prisoners have been redeemed! Sort of. They're following some kooky, made-up quasi-religion. One inmate, Dillon, is more or less the leader. His preaching keeps the guys in line but that preaching comes across as much more corny than powerful. Anyhow, turns out Ripley brought an Alien with her because of course she did. Chaos ensues, we get a bunch of largely incoherent action sequences with a bunch of bald guys we can't tell apart running around willy-nilly. And eventually the movie ends. There's really not much more to it than that. The whole thing has more than a touch of incoherence to it. It's really quite a mess. But when you understand the behind the scenes shenanigans that were going on you realize there was never any way it was going to be anything but a mess. With the weak material he had Fincher was never going to be able to fashion a good movie here. But left to his own devices he surely could have come up with something at least marginally better than this. As it is Alien³ is just an awful, awful movie.",3,0,3,13 August 2014
Captain Phillips," Doesn't stay afloat
","Captain Phillips is a movie which is certainly well-made but ultimately unsatisfying. The production values are there, the entertainment is not. This should be a tight, taut, tense thriller. But the tension seeps away long before the movie finally draws itself to a close. The movie certainly has a captivating, true-life story to work with, a story which would seem to have great potential. But that potential is unrealized. The movie disappoints.Tom Hanks plays Captain Richard Phillips, who is in command of a huge cargo ship headed to Kenya. Rather awful attempt at a Boston accent aside, Hanks is otherwise reliable as ever in the role. And the completely unknown Barkhad Abdi proves a worthy acting adversary for Hanks. Abdi plays Muse, the leader of the gang of four Somali pirates who hijack Captain Phillips's ship. The first half of the movie, setting up the hijacking from the perspectives of both Phillips and the pirates and then the hijacking itself, works reasonably well. The second half of the film, with Phillips having been taken hostage by the pirates as they fled the giant ship in a small lifeboat, works markedly less well.Initially there is great tension as hostage Phillips tries to keep his wits about him and keep himself alive while rescue plans are set in motion. But then the movie just kind of sits there. It becomes very repetitive as we wait for that potential rescue to come. Interactions between Hanks and Abdi, Phillips and Muse, are good. But the other three pirates make either a bad impression or no impression at all. The only other standout, and not in a good way, is the character of Najee, the hothead of the pirate group. His frothing rage wears thin quite quickly. Maybe the true-life counterpart really was like this but in the movie it seems way over the top. He's the designated villain but he's too villainous for the film's good. There are some things to admire about the film. Hanks is solid, the young unknowns playing the pirates do reasonably well with their roles, with Abdi doing quite well indeed. The movie looks good, it was clearly a challenging movie to shoot and director Paul Greengrass pulls that aspect of the proceedings off well. Though there is definitely the sense a steadier camera would have worked well at times, there's only so much shaky-cam you can take. Ultimately though, as with any movie, the most important thing is the story. This story had great promise but for whatever reason it just doesn't work. As the movie careens towards, and then over, the two-hour mark the tension fizzles away. You've had enough and you're just ready for it to be over. This compelling real-life story ultimately makes for a less than compelling movie.",4,2,4,11 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A worthy addition to the saga
","No it is not as good as the original trilogy. But then again, how many movies are? It stands on its own as an entertaining film. And for the Star Wars fan it is fascinating to see how it all began.Much of the joy of watching this film is knowing how the things you are seeing now will impact what is yet to come. George Lucas blends old and new to kickstart his saga. We see the origins and backstory of some of our favorite characters from the original trilogy. R2-D2, C-3PO, Yoda, Jabba...they're all here and it's great to gain some insight into exactly who they are and what their true role is in the whole scheme of things. A key bridge between the two trilogies is Obi-Wan Kenobi. In the original trilogy we really didn't learn much about him. He seemed quite the mysterious figure. Here, as played very well by Ewan McGregor, the character of Obi-Wan really begins to take shape. The other key character that connects the two trilogies is of course Anakin Skywalker, the boy who would become Darth Vader. Jake Lloyd plays young Anakin here and it's safe to say he had not yet honed his craft as an actor. Many were disappointed in his performance and in the character himself. After the epic heroes of the original films it is hard to embrace a small child as a key figure. Better casting (Haley Joel Osment anyone?) would certainly have helped but the truth is there were always going to be problems with this character in the film. Star Wars simply isn't about eight year old boys running around shouting 'Yippee!'. But this is where the story must logically begin.Two vitally important new characters play key roles in Phantom Menace. The first is Qui-Gon Jinn, played by Liam Neeson in a fine performance. A Jedi knight and teacher of young Obi-Wan it is Qui-Gon who really sets the whole saga in motion by discovering young Anakin. With a trade dispute leading to an invasion of the planet Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan must protect the planet's leader, Queen Amidala, played by Natalie Portman. Portman's performance doesn't quite match that of Neeson and McGregor but is certainly serviceable. Amidala and her Jedi protectors take off headed for Coruscant, the central planet in the galaxy where Amidala will plead her planet's case before the Senate. But with their ship damaged they can not make it to Coruscant and instead land on Tatooine, future home of one Luke Skywalker. And so it begins...On Tatooine Qui-Gon first encounters young slave Anakin Skywalker and immediately senses there is something special about the boy. The Force is strong in this one. Following a podrace sequence that, while visually impressive, goes on forever and seems to serve no purpose other than to sell video games Anakin is freed and will take off with Qui-Gon who is convinced the boy is The Chosen One of phophecy who will bring balance to the Force.Off to Coruscant we go and what a sight it is. The entire planet is one large city. While the original trilogy spent most of its time in desolate outposts of the galaxy such as Tatooine and Hoth here the visuals are one of the film's great appeals. The majesty of Coruscant and lush beauty of Naboo are quite the contrast to the sand and ice planets we have seen previously. On Coruscant we see for the first time the massive Jedi temple and see Anakin brought before the Jedi council who will decide if he is to be trained as a Jedi. The Council is headed by Yoda who it is apparent plays a much greater role in the Star Wars universe than we might have thought. He is not just a Jedi. He is THE Jedi. Also on the Council is Mace Windu, played by Samuel L. Jackson in what is really just an extended cameo here. While on Coruscant we get our first view of Senator Palpatine of Naboo in action. Any fan of the saga knows there is more than meets the eye to Palpatine, played wonderfully as always by Ian McDiarmid. After some political machinations Amidala, Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Anakin head back to Naboo and the climactic final battle is upon us.Part of the final battle centers around another new character, Darth Maul, a truly frightening character and a strong villain. He is a Sith, apprentice to Darth Sidious who we see now and again pulling the strings to set the plot in motion. The Sith, strong in the dark side of the Force, have long been thought to be extinct. Finally they will reveal themselves to the Jedi and the battle for the future of the galaxy is on.Oh yes, there is one other new character in Phantom Menace. The less said about the accursed Jar Jar Binks the better. Clearly the worst character to ever be foisted upon the Star Wars fandom, Jar Jar will make you cringe every time he is on the screen and even moreso when he opens his mouth and that ridiculous voice comes out. Nobody over the age of five could possibly enjoy this character who serves no purpose besides selling toys. Ostensibly here for comic relief Jar Jar is completely unfunny and an utter waste of time.In the end this film leaves you wanting more. The story is slow at times, the dialogue seems rather forced now and again and Jar Jar is a disaster. But any Star Wars fan will appreciate this film. The visuals and special effects are marvelous. There are fine performances from Neeson and McGregor. After the majesty, wonder and epic heroes of the original trilogy it is hard to embrace a story about a little boy. But Phantom Menace is an impressive and revealing start to the saga. And we know the best is yet to come.",9,0,3,18 May 2005
The Sound of Music," The hills are alive...
","It is one of the most famous opening scenes in film history. Shot after beautiful shot of the Austrian hills, one after the other, until in the final shot we notice a tiny little figure off in the distance. The camera moves in closer to reveal that the figure is of course Julie Andrews who does a little twirl, spreads her arms and bursts into that oh so famous song. And immediately you get the sense that this movie is going to be something rather special. Critics will say that The Sound of Music is overly sweet and sugary. Well, what's so bad about that? We can use a little sugar now and again. This may well be the ultimate feel-good movie. There are so many reasons why this film is, for so many people, absolutely one of their favorite things.The film's story is so familiar that a recap of the plot seems rather pointless. Suffice to say that it is a great story which provides a worthy foundation for the moments, the songs, the beauty and, above all else, the performances which make the film so memorable. Of course as great as the cast as a whole are there is one performance which stands above the rest. Has any performer in any role in any film ever been as perfect as Julie Andrews as Maria in The Sound of Music? The perfect look matched with the perfect voice. Her acting is superb. Her singing is the stuff of legend. How do you solve a problem like Maria? Don't even try, just allow yourself to be charmed by her. And she can work her charm on anyone, even the toughest nut to crack, Captain Von Trapp. In the film's other starring role Christopher Plummer's Captain provides the perfect complement to the unrelenting sweetness of Andrews as Maria. But of course it will turn out that he's not really as deadly serious as he initially seems. At least he won't be after Maria brings some desperately needed joy back into his family's life.Yes it seems Maria is too good to be true. She's absolutely bursting with life and everyone around her gets swept along for the ride. And the audience gets swept along too. There are so many moments here to bring a smile to your face. Everyone remembers the songs of course. And well they should, they're spectacular, with 'Do-Re-Mi' in particular being just about as fine an example of film-making as you'll ever see. Brilliantly choreographed, beautifully photographed, exquisitely edited...that sequence is pure genius. But this movie is so much more than its wonderful songs. There's the engaging story and the beautiful scenery. There's the tremendous cast, headed of course by the wondrous Andrews but with plenty of opportunities for so many others to shine including the young performers portraying the wonderfully precocious Von Trapp children. If there is any real quibble with the film it's that the third act seems a little tacked on. There's a natural high point in the story which would seemingly have made for the perfect, happy conclusion. But with the Nazis lurking in the background of the film's story throughout you knew they eventually had to rear their ugly head. So right after that natural high point it's Nazi time and the third act takes on a very different tone from all that has preceded it. Deep down you know the third act is important, that this is how the story really has to play itself out. But with all the dark, foreboding drama at the end you can't help but think you'd just rather be watching Julie Andrews get in another pillow fight with a bunch of children. But the film's conclusion, while certainly not all raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, does allow for its own moments of triumph. Ultimately the film gets the rousing conclusion it so richly deserves. The Sound of Music is an absolute treasure, a film which will be beloved for all time.",8,3,10,19 April 2010
The Hangover," Doesn't match the hype
","The Hangover is one of those movies which doesn't live up to the standards suggested by all the breathless hype. It's rather overrated, most definitely not one of the funniest movies ever made as so many of its ardent fans would suggest it to be. It's an OK movie, no more, no less. It has a smart, interesting setup but the setup proves to be better than the execution. You get the sense a lot of truly hilarious things happened over the time frame of the story. But we never actually see those things. We missed the debauchery and saw only the aftermath. It was an interesting premise, having the characters try to piece together what happened during the night of madness they can't remember. But it feels like we missed the good stuff. And what we're left with isn't enough to compensate. It's a movie which has its moments but what should have been the best moments are pretty clearly the moments we never see.The story surrounds a wild, crazy bachelor party. Doug is the groom, his wedding a mere two days away when he, his two best friends and his bride-to-be's rather strange brother head to Vegas. Note to future grooms: going to Vegas two days before your wedding...bad idea. The movie opens on the morning of the wedding with one of the friends calling the bride to deliver the bad news. They can't find Doug. Flash back a couple of days and we see the gang of four preparing for their excursion. We see the drive from California to Vegas, their arrival in Sin City and a toast to a night they'll never forget. And then it's the next morning. And all hell has broken loose. And Doug is gone. And none of the other three can remember a thing. And there's a tiger in the bathroom.There's the tiger. And a chicken, a police car and a mattress impaled on a statue. There's a baby. And a stripper, a naked Asian man and a former heavyweight champion of the world. How do all these things tie together? What the heck happened last night? And where is Doug? Our gang, now down to three, begins a seemingly futile attempt to make sense of the madness. As they try to piece together the puzzle we're treated to some laughs. But not nearly as many laughs as this movie's reputation would suggest. The movie just is not consistently funny enough, it's very hit and miss. And while the setup sounds like it makes room for all kinds of outrageous stuff the movie actually ends up being much more tame than you would think. The fact that the three main characters are as a group rather bland doesn't help. The characters of Phil and Stu, played by Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms respectively, are pretty much straight men, there to play off the really funny characters. And that's where the bride's brother Alan, played by Zach Galifianakis, comes in. He's clearly meant to be the most memorable character, the wacky, strange, outlandish funnyman. But while he's clearly funnier than the other two the character doesn't make as much of an impression as he really needs to for the movie to be as riotously funny as it promised to be. Supporting players, on the screen for only a few minutes here and there, really outshine the three central characters. And that's a problem. The Hangover is the story of one wild night. But it's one wild night which the audience missed out on. Much of the funniest stuff the film has to offer doesn't come until the closing credits have begun to roll. And by then it's much too late. Not a bad movie. But one which has a reputation which far exceeds its actual quality.",6,0,2,29 January 2011
Casablanca," Still a classic as time goes by
","It is easy to see why Casablanca is one of the most beloved films of all time. There's something for everyone...romance, intrigue, suspense and humor. There's a great story here, driven by some truly memorable characters who are brought to life by terrific acting performances. Everyone will remember Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the lead roles but the performances of a number of actors in smaller roles are brilliant as well and vital to the film's success. A film about a rather unique city and unique situation during a very specific time period, World War II, Casablanca still holds up today as a terrific achievement.In the film, Casablanca, a city in the French Morocco, serves as an exit route for refugees seeking to escape the encroaching Nazis. Freedom is not easy to come by. In a plot contrivance created to drive the story forward two letters of transit, which will allow anyone to leave Casablanca with no questions asked, end up in the hands of Rick Blaine, played by Bogart. Rick owns the café in Casablanca which will be the center of most of the activity in the film. He has carved out a comfortable existence for himself amongst all the chaos the war has created around him. As we meet him, Rick is cynical, jaded, not interested in sticking his neck out for anyone. Bogart brings all of this out with a truly memorable performance. Then Ilsa, as played by Bergman walks into his life. Or shall I say, back into his life, because we shall soon see that Rick and Ilsa are far from being strangers. Here is part of the genius of Casablanca, as by going back in time we learn so much more about the man Rick was and begin to understand why he is the man he has become. Soon, Rick's rather comfortable life will be turned upside down as the film moves toward its truly memorable conclusion.Bogart is undeniably brilliant and his scenes with Bergman are remarkable, filled with passion, intrigue and some of the most memorable dialogue ever put to film. But all the Bogart-Bergman hoopla ignores so much of what makes Casablanca great. As resistance leader Victor Laszlo, the other man in Ilsa's life, Paul Henreid is easily overlooked, perhaps seen as the third wheel. But his character is undeniably vital to the story and Henreid plays it with great conviction and talent. Conrad Veidt as the requisite bad guy, Nazi Major Strasser, gives a fine performance. As Sam, the piano player at Rick's, Dooley Wilson provides some memorable songs you may well find yourself still humming hours after the movie ends. Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, S.K. Sakall...all have small but memorable, well-acted roles. And stealing quite a few scenes is Claude Rains as Captain Renault. Much of the humor in the film comes from Rains' terrific performance.A classic for its time, Casablanca holds up remarkably well today. Some of the dialogue and situations may seem a little hokey by modern standards but that doesn't really detract from the experience at all. Casablanca gives us truly memorable characters, places them into a unique situation and then races towards a fascinating conclusion. One would think that Casablanca will always be remembered fondly, no matter how much time goes by.",8,1,3,12 January 2006
In Bruges," A fairytale town...but this is no fairytale
","Bruges. It's in Belgium. And after a job gone wrong two Irish hit-men, Ken and Ray, are sent there to hide out. Their boss loves the place, calling it a fairytale town. Ken becomes a happy tourist, embracing the chance to explore the best-preserved Medieval city in Belgium. Ray is not happy. He wants out of Bruges from the moment he gets there. Touring a Medieval city is not his thing. And it also becomes very quickly obvious that Ray is tormented by something. The film is very smart in waiting to reveal exactly what it is that is weighing so heavily on Ray's mind. When all is revealed a new spin is put on things. The story, which to that point had seemed to be an odd couple comedy, takes an emotional turn. But the film never stops giving you plenty to laugh at. And when Ken and Ray's boss reveals exactly why he sent them to Bruges the film turns again, giving us some action, drama and real suspense. But still laughs too. Always laughs. The film has serious elements but at heart it's always a comedy. A very dark comedy. And a very good one.Much of the credit for the film's success has to go to the actors portraying Ken and Ray. Brendan Gleeson is perfect as Ken, the older and wiser of the pair. And Colin Farrell is excellent as young hothead Ray. Farrell is hilarious in Ray's biting exchanges with Ken about the merits, or lack thereof, of Bruges. But Farrell also nails the serious, emotional side of the character. Gleeson and Farrell really do make for the perfect screen pairing. It helps that they have a great script to work with, writer/director Martin McDonagh providing them with plenty of hilarious dialogue all along the way. The starring pair are also ably supported by some other performers. Ken and Ray's boss is not revealed until well into the picture and when he arrives things really kick up a notch. This guy is explosive and, in his own unique way, hilarious. There's a woman involved, she's about the only thing in Bruges which Ray finds appealing. Oh, there's also a cocaine-snorting racist dwarf with an affinity for hookers.In this film the city of Bruges itself is just as important a character as any of the people. What a lovely city, and director McDonagh shows it off beautifully. It may not be Ray's thing but chances are you'll want to visit the place after seeing the film. And you'll probably want to see the film another time or two as well. It's a dark comedy which gives you plenty of laughs but it has a great deal of heart as well. And some good action too. It's wonderfully scripted, performed perfectly by a great cast and it looks spectacular. Well done by all involved.",7,0,3,30 March 2013
Friday Night Lights," Football is life, the rest is just details
","They like high school football in West Texas. That previous sentence would have a good chance of winning a competition to determine the biggest understatement in the history of the world. The truth is that in West Texas high school football is an obsession. You watch Friday Night Lights and you see the passion. But passion can go too far. The pressure the adults put on a group of teenage boys is ridiculous. The self-worth of a town is determined by the results of high school football games. Adults live vicariously through the team, trying to relive past glories. Or bask in reflected glory since they never actually had any glory of their own. In the midst of all this stands a coach who has to mold his boys into men while also managing to satisfy the town's bloodlust for victory. And there are the boys themselves, they all have their own hopes and dreams, many of which have nothing to do with football. The players are constantly told that playing high school football will be the greatest thing they do in their lives. How sad it will be if that is true.Coach Gary Gaines, played by Billy Bob Thornton, is the central character in the film. Gaines is a man put under tremendous pressure and he handles it about as well as you could possibly hope he would. He understands that the town's obsession with his team is unhealthy at best, dangerous at worst. But make no mistake, the coach wants to win. And he's got the team to do it. Until he loses his star player to injury in the first game. Can he rally his team in the face of adversity? The movie follows the team on its roller-coaster ride of a season, big ups and downs all along the way. There's some drama, some excitement, and maybe even a little room for growth for some characters who may come to realize there is in fact more to life than high school football.Thornton gives a very strong performance in the starring role. And Tim McGraw is a revelation as the alcoholic, emotionally abusive father of one of the players. While Thornton and McGraw are excellent and create a couple of memorable characters the movie doesn't do as good a job as you would hope in establishing the personalities and stories of the players. The cocky, headstrong star running back has some pizazz to him but injury cuts him down. The film has some good emotional moments with him as he struggles to accept his fate. But when the story turns its attention to the other players things fall somewhat flat. The quarterback is quite bland. Most of the other players remain total mysteries, not established well enough at all for us to really care much about them or their fates. There is the one player, the son of the McGraw character, who has his moments but that story is much more about the dad than the son. It's odd but in this story of a high school football team it is the team itself, the players, who get short shrift. It all makes for an interesting movie but it doesn't pack the emotional wallop of some other movies of its type. There's some decent drama but nothing that really has you on the edge of your seat. This look at a team and its town has some good pieces but it never quite all comes together. In reaching for the goal line maybe this movie comes up just a yard or two short.",7,0,1,8 November 2012
Erin Brockovich," Unique heroine, uplifting tale
","Erin Brockovich. Starring Julia Roberts. Co-starring Julia Roberts's cleavage. OK that's a bit of a stretch. But not by much. And it begins to tell you something about the woman Roberts plays. Erin Brockovich is not the bashful type. Loud, profane and quick to flaunt her, uh, assets. Erin's quite a package. And Roberts brings that package to the screen wonderfully. The excellent performance of the film's star helps gloss over some of the film's failings. There's a great story to work with here but you get the sense that story could have been told a little better. But Roberts keeps the film moving along best she can, whenever it threatens to veer well off course she's there to pull it together. The end result is a film which is perhaps not outstanding but certainly enjoyable and well worth seeing.So who is Erin Brockovich anyway? She's an unemployed single mother facing a desperate struggle to make ends meet. She talks her way into a job as a file clerk in a law office. Her boisterous personality and skimpy attire do not make her very popular amongst her female co-workers. And she continues to exasperate her boss, lawyer Ed Masry, who has no idea what to do with her. What he'd probably like to do is get rid of her. But when Erin starts digging into a real estate case which oddly has a slew of medical records tied to it things change. It becomes pretty clear that a massive cover-up has taken place, a huge utility company hiding the fact they have contaminated a town's water supply. Ed realizes Erin has hit on something. And now the two of them are going to form a very unlikely team. Erin hurtling forward at the speed of light and Ed trying to rein her in. Together they can hope to accomplish something quite remarkable, winning justice for a town full of innocent people whose lives have been destroyed.This film belongs to Julia Roberts all the way. She's on the screen for virtually every second of the film's running time. But in Albert Finney, who plays Ed Masry, Roberts has a very worthy foil. Erin Brockovich is bursting with energy and enthusiasm, full of determination to do what is right and win justice. Ed Masry is older, wearier, worn-down and inclined to do what is easiest. The actors playing the roles, Roberts and Finney, bring the contrast between the characters to life beautifully. It is in their interplay that the film has most of its best moments.There are times the movie struggles to move its story along. It sometimes gets bogged down in legal procedure. It brings in characters it doesn't make the best use of, most notably George, a biker played by Aaron Eckhart. Erin and George have a romantic relationship of sorts but the movie never spends enough time with the couple for us to really care how that part of the story plays itself out. The movie also glosses over some key parts of the real-life story, including Erin's own illnesses she suffered with during her investigation into the maladies of the townspeople. That was a chance for some dramatic tension which went begging. And there are some aspects of the case which are never made sufficiently clear. For instance there's one woman in the town who Erin works on tirelessly to get her to sign on to the lawsuit against the utility company. This woman is apparently the key to the whole thing. Why is she so important? The movie never begins to tell us. This is by no means the most dramatic of legal thrillers. There are no great twists and turns, no shadowy villains lurking in the corners. But what the movie might lack in dramatic zest it makes up for in heart. Roberts and Finney give tremendous performances and they carry the film along to a satisfying end. Maybe Erin Brockovich, the movie, falls somewhat short of greatness. But Erin Brockovich, the woman, did great things and she makes for a great movie character. And in this case that's enough to make this movie a success.",7,1,2,19 October 2012
Se7en," Dark, disturbing and fabulous
","In a dark, gloomy city where the rain never stops and the signs of urban decay are everywhere you look two detectives hunt down a serial killer. The first detective is William Somerset, about to retire and desperately looking forward to a quiet life in the country away from all the urban misery. The second is young hotshot David Mills. He is to be Somerset's replacement and he can't wait to get started. He actually asked for this assignment. He relishes the opportunity to deal with the worst of the worst in this hellish city. Of course he has no idea what he's in for. Somerset knows. Or at least he thinks he does. Because not even wise, old Somerset could possibly anticipate the events which are about to unfold. These two detectives, one on the way in and one on the way out, will be forced into a reluctant partnership as they work one chilling case. The dead bodies begin to pile up and Somerset and Mills get more than they ever could have bargained for. And quite possibly more than they can bear.Somerset and Mills find themselves investigating a bizarre and horrifying series of murders. By the time the second body turns up it is clear that an obviously deranged, though also obviously intelligent, killer is planning on murdering one victim to represent each of the seven deadly sins. A morbidly obese man is forced to eat himself to death. Gluttony. A rich attorney is forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh. Greed. And so on. The killings are gruesome. The killer, dubbed John Doe, is a man clearly capable of unimaginably monstrous things. And somehow Somerset and Mills have to stop him before he completes his set. Before he completes his deranged sermon to the world. It all makes for one morbidly fascinating movie. And one with a unique twist. Serial killer movies generally go one of two ways. Either they show you the killer all the way through as you watch him do his bloody work. Or they keep the killer invisible and focus solely on those pursuing him. This movie leads you in one direction and then whips you around and turns everything on its head. Rather brilliant stuff.As we watch Somerset and Mills do the old cop/young cop routine we've seen in so many other movies the contrasts between the two are exceedingly obvious. These are two very different men, attacking the John Doe case from two very different perspectives. Somerset is calm, collected, a thinking man. And Morgan Freeman, with his quiet dignity, portrays this perfectly. Mills is a man more about action than thought. He's brash, emotional and a little immature. You get the sense early on that this is a man who may not be ready for what he is going to have to face. In playing this part Brad Pitt has his ups and downs. It's not a bad performance by any means but there are moments where the character's words and actions don't really ring true. Mills comes off as being a little too insecure, and at times downright childish. The contrast between Mills and Somerset is supposed to be obvious, and supposed to be a major theme of the film. But at times the contrast is just a little too stark to be believable. Even in the incredibly tense, drama-packed finale Pitt's Mills comes across as much too whiny and immature. His reactions to what he is confronted with just don't seem to fit. Perhaps Pitt went just a touch too far in displaying all of the insecurities and personality quirks which make up Detective Mills. But it's nothing bad enough to really detract from the overall movie-watching experience. Director David Fincher crafted something rather special here. So much more than just another serial killer movie. It's smart, it's riveting, and in the end it's quite jaw-dropping. Maybe Pitt is just adequate. But Freeman is brilliant. And one other performer is even better than that. But that final, perfectly fitted piece to this puzzle you have to discover for yourself.",8,0,2,15 January 2011
Citizen Kane," An epic facing the test of time
","An unquestioned masterpiece of its time Citizen Kane holds up pretty well decades later. While some may find it a little slow by modern standards all in all it is easy to see why it is among the most celebrated films of all time. It is a fascinating story brilliantly told. It is also a film which was innovative on so many levels, most notably for its stunning cinematography. Brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed by Orson Welles, Citizen Kane was a true triumph.Citizen Kane is the life story of Charles Foster Kane, rather obviously based on real-life newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst. In a rather unique twist the film begins with Kane's death. Through the use of a newsreel obituary we are then told Kane's entire life story in the span of just a few minutes. But we will soon see there is so much more to this story. For a man who lived so much of his life in the public eye, Kane was in fact quite a mystery. One mystery he leaves behind is the meaning of his dying word, 'Rosebud.' A reporter is sent on a mission to find the meaning of that last word. Through interviews with those who knew him and flashbacks which tell the story behind the story we will follow the fascinating life of Charles Foster Kane. And perhaps if we can discover the meaning of 'Rosebud' we can unravel the mystery of exactly who this man was.From beginning to end this is Orson Welles' film. His performance as Kane, spanning an entire lifetime from idealistic young man to bitter, old recluse is simply stunning. The film soars whenever Welles is on screen, especially in Kane's vibrant youth. When the film stops to let others tell Kane's story some of the magic is lost. All of the other performances, from a cast of mostly unknowns, are commendable. But this is Kane's, and by extension Welles' movie. Welles is a commanding presence and the film suffers for his periodic absences. Kane's story is a fascinating one and the circular manner in which it was told makes it even more thrilling. With each succeeding flashback another layer is peeled away and we learn more about who Charles Foster Kane really was. It is a life of tremendous peaks and mortifying valleys. For the viewer it is a thrilling journey to follow. It really is one of the great character studies of all time as we see Kane evolve over time and see what drives this extraordinarily successful yet seemingly unfulfilled man. And of course there is 'Rosebud.' Can a man of the stature of Charles Foster Kane really be explained in one word? That is the film's great mystery and it is a fascinating one. Put it all together and Citizen Kane gives you a truly unique and memorable experience.",8,2,4,12 August 2005
Monster," Ugly yourself up, win an Oscar
","Oscar voters love it when performers transform themselves into something as far away as possible from who they really are. Charlize Theron is not crazy, is stunningly beautiful and I rather doubt she will ever kill seven people. So playing a crazy, ugly serial killer gets her an Oscar. Never mind the fact the movie isn't any good. Yes, Theron undergoes a stunning transformation. And it certainly took some serious acting talent for her to pull off this role. She's believable as notorious murderer Aileen Wuornos. But you'd like to think winning an Oscar would require more than just being believable in a role that doesn't suit you at all. Especially when, however good your performance may be perceived to be, the movie itself fails rather miserably.Monster suffers from a severe lack of drama. OK, so it's a true story and we know from the beginning exactly where this is headed. But there have been plenty of movies based on true stories which, even though you knew their ultimate destination, have been throughly compelling and entertaining. Sadly that is far from being the case here. This movie is mind-numbingly boring. There are only two characters even worth mentioning. One of course is Aileen, the other is her little lesbian lover Selby who spends the whole movie following Aileen around like a pathetic, clueless little puppy dog. Poor Christina Ricci is saddled with this part, the character is such a total zero there was never really any chance for Ricci to make anything of it. She really has nothing to do, it is Theron's movie through and through. And that brings its own problems. First off the layers of ugly makeup slathered all over her face look ridiculous. For much of this movie Aileen doesn't even look human. With all that gunk on her face it's nearly impossible to see Theron emote at all. Her face is a blank, ugly slate. Note to future filmmakers: if you want to make a movie about a notably unattractive woman perhaps best to not cast one of the world's most beautiful women in the role. All the effort required to make Theron look hideous ends up hurting the film. Quite frankly, she looks ridiculous. Theron certainly gives a game effort, trying so hard to be something she so obviously is not. But the way she carries herself, all her exaggerated mannerisms in trying to show how uncomfortable Aileen Wuornos was in her own skin, it just doesn't work. If you have to try this hard to appear awkward and ungainly perhaps this isn't the role for you. The movie is also hurt by the director's obvious, and obviously misguided, attempt to turn Aileen Wuornos into a a sympathetic figure. This effort fails miserably. You don't feel sympathy for the character. Honestly the movie is such a snooze you really don't feel much of anything at all. But if you did, sympathy for this monstrous murderer would certainly not be the prevailing emotion. The only good thing you can say about this movie is that Theron took on an incredible challenge and that she did about as well as could be expected with it. But it's not the stuff of Oscar dreams. And the movie as a whole is a nightmare.",5,3,7,7 January 2011
Memento," Perfection
","This is why you watch movies. You watch hundreds upon hundreds of movies hoping to someday find a gem like Memento. This is, quite simply, the perfect movie.The less said about the plot the better. Best to let you try to put this movie's puzzle together yourself. And what an ingeniously crafted puzzle it is. Anyone who saw this movie upon its initial release knew writer/director Christopher Nolan was a filmmaker destined to do great things. And we all know how that's turned out. Along with his brother Jonathan, writer of the original short story upon which the screenplay is based, Christopher Nolan here has crafted a story which seems impossibly complex but which is actually rather simple. It is the manner in which Nolan chooses to allow that simple story to unfold which is the genius of the film. The story is so engaging and so brilliantly put together that when the movie ends you desperately want to see it again. Immediately. You can't pay a movie any higher compliment than that.Memento centers around the character of Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce in what is an absolutely stunning performance. Leonard is out for revenge, hunting down the man who murdered his wife. But Leonard's investigation is hampered, to say the least, by the injury he sustained on the night his wife was attacked. He has no short-term memory. He remembers everything up to the attack. But he can't make new memories. Everything fades away. If he meets someone he won't remember them minutes later. And Christopher Nolan ingeniously puts us right inside Leonard's head. How? By telling the story backwards. We begin at the end and work our way towards the beginning. So as we see events unfold we, like Leonard, do not know what has happened beforehand. The effect is downright brilliant. Leonard will be helped by two people in his quest for vengeance. First is the mysterious Teddy, played by Joe Pantoliano. Who is this guy and why is he helping Leonard? Because the movie begins at the end we know right away something is not right about Teddy. And you can't wait for the story to unravel itself to find out how we get to that end. Also providing assistance to Leonard is a bartender named Natalie, played by Carrie-Anne Moss. Much like Teddy it seems Natalie has her own motives for helping Leonard. Who is this woman and what exactly is she playing at? Part of the thrill of watching the film is finding the answers to those questions.So there's the plot, a seemingly simple story told in a wonderfully unique way. Needless to say the story is not nearly as simple as it seems. There are so many twists and turns but best to let you discover those for yourself. It really is a perfectly constructed puzzle. Everything has to fit just so, any small mistakes anywhere along the way could have sunk the whole thing. There are no mistakes. It's perfect. There are really only three major roles and they're all performed wonderfully. Pantoliano and Moss are very good but Pearce is truly spectacular. What a challenging role to play and he pulls it off brilliantly. Great actors performing a great story...that's generally the formula for an exceptional film. And that is the case here. Memento was nominated for the Oscar for best screenplay. It lost to Gosford Park. Does anyone even remember Gosford Park? Nobody who sees Memento will ever forget it. This movie will live forever. You'll want to see it again and again and again. It is the perfect movie.",10,1,4,2 May 2010
Inglourious Basterds," That's a bingo!
","Brad Pitt stars in Quentin Tarantino's big, audacious World War II movie. And Pitt, through no fault of his own, has the movie stolen right out from under him by Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent. Which begs the question, who the heck are Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent? You may not have known who they were before Inglourious Basterds but everyone will know them now. Especially Waltz who, in creating one of the most memorable movie villains of all time, deservedly won pretty much every acting award worth winning. His performance is the best thing in what turns out to be the best film Tarantino has made in quite some time.Right from the beginning you get the sense Inglourious Basterds is going to be unlike most anything you've seen before. The very first scene is filled with almost unbearable tension. And what does that scene consist of? Essentially it's just two guys sitting at a table talking. And talking, and talking, and talking some more. OK, so maybe this is like some Tarantino movies you've seen before. Played incorrectly this scene could have been interminable. But Waltz is not going to let that happen. He portrays SS Colonel Hans Landa and he owns this scene. Actually he owns pretty much every scene in which he appears. His Hans Landa is absolutely chilling. Beneath the calm veneer you know there lurks so much evil waiting to explode. Not for nothing is Hans Landa nicknamed Jew Hunter. The palpable sense of menace whenever Landa is on the screen is unmistakable. The performance from Waltz is the stuff of legend. This is one of the most memorable acting performances ever seen.Meanwhile Mélanie Laurent makes quite an impression of her own portraying Shosanna Dreyfus, a young Jewish woman who with a new identity has built a new life for herself after escaping the Jew Hunter's clutches. Now known as Emmanuelle Mimieux she owns a cinema in Paris. Nazi-occupied Paris that is. Surrounded by the enemy Shosanna is a woman who longs for revenge. And an unbelievable opportunity for vengeance will be dropped right into her lap. Cool and detached as Shoshanna may seem to be you never doubt that in the critical moment she will be as strong and determined as she needs to be to get the job done. Playing Shoshanna with that almost impossible coolness in the face of unthinkable circumstance Laurent is pretty much perfect. Full credit to her for creating a tremendous movie heroine.So we've got a couple of unknowns brilliantly bringing to life a memorable heroine and an all-time movie villain. What then of Pitt, the nominal star of the movie? In his portrayal of Lt. Aldo Raine, leader of the Nazi-killing Basterds of the movie's title, Pitt is fine. His exaggerated Southern drawl does wear a bit thin after a while but that's a minor quibble. The real issue is that the film may be titled Inglourious Basterds but those Basterds are really the least interesting part of the movie. They're good for a few moments of ultra-violence but story-wise this movie really belongs to Hans Landa and Shosanna Dreyfus. But that's OK because we've already established how great those characters are. Eventually all the disparate strands of the story, Basterds included, will come together and then you can see that Tarantino has pulled off something rather special here. Maybe there are a few places where the story lags but that is more than offset by scenes of unbearable tension. Ironically most of those scenes, like the opening one, seem to be nothing more than people sitting around a table talking. That's our Quentin alright. Another unmistakable Tarantino touch is the film's music. Most notable is the use in one critical scene of a David Bowie song, written nearly three decades earlier for another movie, which is so perfect you would swear it had been written just now for this scene in this movie. Tarantino's encyclopedic knowledge of film history pays off again. And while Pitt is the big name and Waltz and Laurent make the big impressions Tarantino makes use of a wide and varied supporting cast, all of whom are absolutely spot-on. Not a casting misstep to be found. This is a great story and one that is performed brilliantly. Nobody else would have ever made this movie, it's a Tarantino movie through and through. And it's one of Quentin's best.",8,1,5,14 May 2010
Underworld," Silly but smart. And fun too
","Vampires and werewolves and Kate Beckinsale in skintight rubber. What more could you ask from a movie? Now nobody is going to confuse Underworld with any kind of work of great cinema. But for what it is it works. Yes, the whole thing is rather silly. At times it is very hard to take the movie seriously. So don't bother trying to take it seriously, just enjoy it. Silly vampire movie that it may be Underworld does have some brains to it. The vampire/werewolf back-story mythology is worked out very carefully. The movie's not just vampires and werewolves brainlessly slaughtering each other, there's actually a reason they're slaughtering each other. Much of the back-story is not revealed until well into the movie so you've had time to build your own ideas of what's really going on, who is good and bad, what is right and wrong. Then the movie springs some surprises on you and puts a whole new spin on things. And then the vampires and werewolves resume slaughtering one another.Beckinsale, lovingly photographed with as many butt shots as possible, is the glue that holds the movie together. There's some rather silly stuff she's forced to say and do. Some of the movie's dialogue is rather laughable. But Beckinsale makes it work. She brings an air of seriousness to the proceedings. But not too serious. A movie about a thousand-year war between vampires and werewolves can't be too serious. It needs to be fun. And this movie is. More or less. There are pieces that don't work. One acting performance, that of Shane Brolly as the vampire Kraven, is rather disastrous. The performance is off, the character is off. It's as if Brolly is acting in his own little movie. And his movie is much worse than everybody else's. But the rest of the cast performs admirably. Kate's great in her role of Selene, a vampire whose mission in life is to seek out and destroy Lycans. By Lycans I mean werewolves. The movie insists on calling werewolves Lycans because I guess it sounds cooler or something. Whatever. Michael Sheen makes for an excellent antagonist as the leader of the werewolves. Scott Speedman is appropriately flustered as a human caught up in the middle of all this nonsense. And Bill Nighy gets special credit for his performance as vampire elder Viktor who doesn't look too good when awakened from his long nap. Nighy deals admirably with one of all the all-time movie prosthetic/makeup jobs. The movie looks terrific with some dazzling visual effects, great sets and wonderful costumes. The story takes a little while to get going and has its ups and downs. But it eventually pays itself off pretty well. In the end there is really no ending at all, just a setup for a sequel. This type of thing I generally despise but here I'm actually looking forward to seeing Beckinsale shoehorn herself into that catsuit for some more vampire/werewolf shenanigans. Underworld is by no means a great movie. But its got enough fun and, especially for its genre, enough smarts to make it worthwhile. And it's good enough to make you want to jump back into this world again.",6,5,9,28 September 2011
Shakespeare in Love," Love and laughs
","William Shakespeare is struggling with the writing of his new play, Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter. Look at the title of that play and it doesn't take a Shakespearean scholar to see where this is headed. Yes, this will be the story of the making of Romeo and Juliet. Not the true story but a fanciful notion of what might have been. And after watching this film you can't help but wish that this had actually been the way it played out. Because it's a great story. A smart one too, with a script so chock-full of brilliant little nuggets that Shakespeare himself would be proud. It's a story of forbidden love, Shakespeare weaving the events of his own life into the famous play we know so well. But along with the love there are laughs as we watch Shakespeare and his players struggle to bring Romeo and Juliet to life. And there are so many sly, witty references to other famous works of Shakespeare that it is probably impossible to catch them all. Like any great story this one requires great performers to give it life. Happily this film has great performers in abundance.Joseph Fiennes plays Shakespeare and captures wonderfully all the frustrations of a struggling playwright. He also makes for part of a great pair as Shakespeare struggles with his love which cannot be. The woman he falls for is Viola De Lesseps, a woman of privilege and, not incidentally, a huge fan of theater. She falls for Shakespeare just as hard and just as quickly as he falls for her. But unfortunately their love is doomed as she is promised in marriage to the rather odious Lord Wessex. Meanwhile Viola, huge theater fan that she is, is determined to play a role in Shakespeare's newest play despite the prohibition on women performers in this era. Disguised as a man she wins the part of Romeo. Shakespeare uncovers her true identity and their love continues to bloom even as she keeps up her charade. She is his inspiration, his lover and his lead performer. But her charade cannot last and neither can their love. Eventually, and inevitably, all hell breaks loose.The part of Viola, a dual role really, is a very challenging one to play and Gwyneth Paltrow does a magnificent job with it. She's a beautiful, radiant, charming woman who can slap on a fake mustache and a wig and fool everyone into thinking she's a man. A life with two sides and Paltrow is letter-perfect throughout. As a woman she's a wonderful lover. As a man she's a heck of a performer. Of course her dual life causes complications. It also causes laughs. This is not a film to leave you rolling in the aisles but there is a lot of good comedy here, and smart comedy at that. And while it is Fiennes and Paltrow at the heart of the story who are most responsible for carrying the film there are so many other fine performances here. As Queen Elizabeth Judi Dench isn't on the screen much but she makes the most of every moment she has. Such a great presence and she manages to provide some humor as well. Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson and Colin Firth all get their moments to shine. And playing a cocky, egotistical actor there's Ben Affleck, who plays the part with a knowing wink and plays it wonderfully. This is a film with a lot of charm and plenty of wit. Maybe it never hits the highest comedic heights but it will probably have you smiling throughout. Yes, as so many have stated, the fact that it beat out Saving Private Ryan for Best Picture is rather baffling. Doesn't mean it's not a good film in its own right though. The screenplay is brilliant, the performances are terrific. It makes for, if not Best Picture material, a thoroughly enjoyable diversion.",7,0,3,22 March 2012
Alien: Resurrection," Let it die
","Ellen Ripley is back for another Alien adventure. Kindly ignore the fact that when last we saw her Ripley was quite dead. How to continue a franchise when you've killed off your star? Cloning of course. Duh. So 200 years after her demise Ripley is back, the military having cloned her because they want the Alien queen that was inside her when she died. You think the military would have learned better by now than to try to harness these Alien killing machines. But of course had they learned their lesson there would be no movie. And the studio wanted to make some easy cash off another Alien movie so here we are. After the disaster that was Alien³ the franchise should have been allowed to die. This movie is slightly better than the last but that's not saying much. Enough is enough.As ever with this franchise Sigourney Weaver is the best thing about this film. Another strong performance as she portrays a strong heroine. And this time there's a little mystery to Ripley, with the cloning process she's got some Alien blood mixed up inside her. That raises some interesting issues. Indeed the first part of this film does show some promise as we get to know this new Ripley. But it devolves rather quickly. It turns into just another rehash. Aliens attack, blood and gore, repeat as necessary. We've seen all this before and quite frankly we've seen more than enough of it. The story does have a few new twists as it moves towards the finish. But by the time the 'big' moments come you'll probably have lost interest. Weaver gets very little support. Winona Ryder is the big co-star here and she's all wrong for this movie. Sci-fi action is not her thing. The only other actor who stands out at all is Ron Perlman. Unfortunately he only stands out because of how annoying his character is. Reminiscent of Bill Paxton in Aliens. Perlman isn't quite as annoying as Paxton was but it's close. There aren't enough good things here to make the resurrection of this franchise remotely worthwhile. Let Ripley and the Aliens rest in peace.",4,0,2,7 June 2015
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," One to remember
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a consistently funny and at times utterly hilarious movie. Can't ask for much more than that from a comedy. That the movie has some heart to it is a nice little bonus. Yes the movie is somewhat raunchy but it's also kind of sweet. It's a delicate balance but one which works. Full credit to writer Jason Segel for pulling that off. Of course Segel is not just the movie's writer, he's also the star and his performance provides much of the film's ultimate appeal. He plays Peter Bretter, a composer for a popular CSI-style television show in which his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, stars. Unfortunately for Peter his carefree, blissful and somewhat sloth-like existence is about to be rudely interrupted. Sarah dumps him. Peter, to put it mildly, does not take the news well. You can't help but feel for the big lug and that's a feeling that stays with you throughout the whole movie. Segel has created a character who is so easy to like. But as much as you like him you can laugh at him too. And as the movie plays out there will certainly be plenty of opportunities to laugh at the expense of poor Peter.After wallowing in post-breakup grief for a while Peter decides that perhaps a vacation will help him forget Sarah Marshall. So off to Hawaii he goes. Unfortunately it turns out that Sarah is vacationing at the same Hawaiian resort. With her new boyfriend, the pompous, narcissistic British rock star Aldous Snow. Awkward. But this situation is a potential comedy gold mine and hilarity most assuredly will ensue. Segel is great throughout but Russell Brand threatens to steal the show with his portrayal of Aldous. I am not really a fan of Brand at all but there is no denying he is perfect for this role. Mila Kunis has plenty of good moments in playing Rachel, the hotel receptionist who helps Peter break out of his funk. And the likes of Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd are on hand in smaller roles and each of them is very funny as well. Ironically, given the movie's title, the most forgettable character is Sarah Marshall. Kristen Bell plays the role and there's nothing wrong with her performance. Her character just never seems to get the big comedic moments. She's the straight woman who is largely left to react to all the antics going on around her.Funny throughout the movie really kicks into high gear near the end. The big climactic scene is rather bizarre but delightfully so. It's a fitting cap to a thoroughly enjoyable movie-watching experience. The movie clocks in at nearly two hours which you might think would be a little long for a movie of this type. But the movie never really drags. The story keeps moving forward and there are plenty of moments of comic genius sprinkled all along the way. It's a movie that has big laughs and big heart. There's also room for some memorable songs which are all performed wonderfully and which provide some of the movie's funniest moments. Everything comes together quite well. This is a movie to remember, one which definitely leaves you with a smile on your face.",8,0,2,29 August 2010
12 Monkeys," Intriguing story, lackluster execution
","In 2027 James Cole is a prisoner living beneath the streets of Philadelphia with some of the very few survivors of a virus which wiped out most of humankind back in 1996. Somehow these people living under the streets have invented time travel. OK then. The scientists in charge send Cole back to 1996 to collect information on the virus in order to develop a cure. Why, if you have time travel capabilities, the focus is on finding a cure for the few people alive in 2027 rather than stopping the virus from wiping out the species in the first place is not particularly clear. Anyhow Cole's mission gets off to a bad start when he ends up in 1990 rather than 1996 and immediately finds himself placed in a mental institution. This is all very weird. It's about to get much weirder.Cole ends up jumping back and forth in time, quite befuddled by the whole experience. Anyone watching this film will also feel that sense of befuddlement. It's certainly an intriguing story but one which director Terry Gilliam never really got a firm grasp on. The film ends up being a bit of a disjointed mess. You're drawn into the story but ultimately end up lost in this movie's complex maze. Bruce Willis turns in a solid performance as Cole. He's solid and reliable, giving this film which threatens to veer out of control some desperately needed grounding. Brad Pitt is the other big star. He plays Jeffrey Goines who is one of the craziest crazies in the institution. Pitt plays the part with wild-eyed manic enthusiasm. The effect is quite jarring. Yes, Jeffrey is supposed to be crazy but this is some serious overacting on Pitt's part. Madeleine Stowe plays the female lead, Kathryn Railly, Cole's doctor at the institution. Cole pops in and out of her life. Initially she thinks he's nuts but as she processes new information she may have to re-evaluate that position. Unfortunately the chemistry between Willis and Stowe is lacking, the relationship between their characters falls rather flat. And as their relationship becomes more important in the story that becomes a big problem for the movie.Ultimately 12 Monkeys is a rather frustrating film. It has an intriguing premise but the story does not play itself out in a very satisfying way. Things get muddled pretty quickly and the story twists itself into some confusing knots. The film tries to spring some surprises but telegraphs some of its twists way too soon, which is part of the reason the ending is not nearly as powerful as Gilliam would hope. Meanwhile Gilliam's assortment of visual tricks throughout serve no purpose other than to distract and annoy. Stowe's performance lacks energy, Pitt's has too much energy. Christopher Plummer is underused. Willis does a fine job but too much of what surrounds him disappoints. For all the jumping back and forth in time the film is rather slowly paced. The story may interest you but there really is not much in the way of entertainment. You would imagine a story such as this would be full of exciting moments but excitement is in very short supply. 12 Monkeys held great promise but in the end that promise is not fulfilled.",5,8,14,12 October 2015
Argo," Thriller which should be more thrilling
","Argo is based on a true story. Somewhat loosely based it will turn out. Director Ben Affleck bends some historical truths in an attempt to make his film more exciting. The story of the rescue of six American diplomats from Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis is certainly compelling. But it turns out the real-life story, ironically involving a fake Hollywood movie, was not dramatic enough for a real Hollywood movie. Affleck had to jazz things up, create tension in places where there really was none. That effort fails largely because some of the fake incidents Affleck throws in are such obvious Hollywood creations. No way it happened like that you're thinking as you watch the movie. All the contrived razor-tight close calls fall flat and actually come across as a little silly. Silly is not what you're looking for as you ramp up to the big finish of a thriller. Seeing as it is more or less a true story, meaning you know the ending, it is admittedly hard to create that great dramatic tension. Some films which tell true stories overcome this problem better than others. Apollo 13 comes to mind, that was real edge of the seat stuff. Argo is not. It's not nearly as gripping and exciting as you would hope. Affleck seemed to realize this and tried desperately hard to make it more exciting but those efforts end up hurting the film more than helping it.So this is a bad movie then? No, not at all. It's a good movie, maybe not as good as you would hope, maybe not Oscar-worthy but good nonetheless. Yes it has its flaws but the overall package is more than acceptable. It is a great story, the CIA working with Hollywood to create a fake movie to get Americans out of Iran. It's in the putting together of that fake film that Argo really shines. The inside Hollywood stuff, helped immensely by great performances from Alan Arkin and John Goodman, works really well. Bryan Cranston also does fine work, bringing good energy to his role as a CIA supervisor involved in putting the plan together. The one real flat performance unfortunately comes from the star, Affleck himself. He plays CIA operative Tony Mendez, the man who will ultimately go to Iran to get the Americans out. And Affleck doesn't bring much to the role. Everyone around him is more interesting than he is. It's an oddly bland character, the guy is supposed to be some kind of CIA super-spy but there's very little personality there. The gang of six who are to be rescued don't infuse the film with much life either. We don't really get to know those characters very well which maybe doesn't make us as invested in their fate as the film needs us to be to really succeed.There is a lot to quibble with but there is a lot to recommend the film as well. The opening scene of the Iranian takeover of the American embassy is brilliantly done. The film may lack some needed tension later on but this opening gives the film a thoroughly gripping start. The real-life plan to extricate the six Americans was brilliant and this film does an excellent job as it puts that plan together. It's a story which has to be seen to be believed. The story draws you in and you expect the big, dramatic payoff to come with the ultimate rescue. But that rescue is not as exciting as you would hope. Affleck tries really hard to make it more thrilling. But he tried too hard, forced it too much. Much of the film's final act comes off as much too fake. You know it didn't happen like that so you don't really buy in. Couple that with the sense of inevitability that lingers with any true-life story in which you know the outcome and these final scenes can't help but be a little disappointing. It's a good effort from director Affleck but there is the nagging sense this film got much more acclaim than it deserved. A good film but greatness definitely eludes it. And movie star Affleck didn't help director Affleck very much.",7,1,2,22 June 2013
12 Angry Men," Wonderful simplicity
","Twelve men sit around a table and talk for an hour and a half. There's your movie. Doesn't sound like much now does it? But 12 Angry Men turns out to be an exercise in wonderful simplicity. It is refreshing to know that in order to make a great movie you do not need a huge budget. No special effects are necessary. Wonderfully vibrant locations can be done without. In some cases all you need to make a great movie is a great story performed by great actors. And in 12 Angry Men that is what you get.12 Angry Men presents an exceedingly simple yet undeniably powerful story. We follow the jury deliberations in the New York City trial of a young man, a boy really, who is accused of killing his father. There is a very brief introductory scene in the courtroom as the judge presents the jury with its instructions. Apart from that scene and another very brief moment outdoors at the very end the entire film takes place within the confines of the jury room. And what goes on inside that room will fascinate. What seems to be, as one juror points out immediately, an open and shut case turns out to be much more complex. We will get to know each of the twelve members of this jury, men who come to this room from all different types of backgrounds, each with his own unique perspective. Some of the twelve will end up playing a bigger role than others but each man certainly plays his part in what unfolds.Initially eleven of the jurors vote to find the defendant guilty. There is only one holdout, Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda. Fonda's character may not be convinced of the boy's innocence but he feels the defendant is at least owed a fair deliberation to determine if there could in fact be reasonable doubt. And off the movie goes, with Juror #8 seeking to convince his fellow jurors that maybe this is not such an open and shut case after all. Suffice to say it will be quite difficult to get some of those in the room to change their mind. There are dramatic twists and turns along the way and in their interactions we learn a lot about each of these twelve men who bring their own prejudices and emotions to the proceedings. A few of the jurors stand out, most notably numbers 3 and 10 who are most adamant about the boy's guilt. Played by Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley respectively this pair threaten to overwhelm the proceedings at times with their explosive outbursts. The contrast between this pair's rantings and the calm, rational, reasoned arguments presented by Fonda's character are quite clear. Without a doubt Fonda is the star of the film but it is the opportunity he gets to play off of the other characters which really makes the film. Without the contributions of Cobb and Begley the whole thing would be rather mundane. And the other nine actors are not to be forgotten either. Each of the jurors is completely unique and every performer in the cast does a terrific job in breathing life into their character.When a movie consists almost entirely of a group of men sitting around talking there are certain to be a few lulls and sure enough this film has a few. But once the deliberations really hit their stride and the arguments are flying back and forth the film never fails to fascinate. It's an incredibly simple movie. In this case simplicity works wonderfully. Great performances, from Fonda of course but from each of the other eleven actors as well, make this simple story real edge of the seat stuff. What goes on inside the confines of that jury room is truly memorable. It's a wonderful film and a wonderful look inside the American justice system, serving as a reminder that even the most seemingly open and shut case may not be so clear cut after all.",8,1,1,5 December 2008
The Other Boleyn Girl," The sad saga of the Boleyns
","If you are a student of history you know that this is not a movie in which everyone is destined to live happily ever after. If you are not a student of history you've probably wandered into the wrong movie. 16th century English royal dramas are not everyone's cup of tea. I suppose one could try to ignore the historical aspects and just look at this as a romance film. But there really is nothing particularly romantic going on here. The characters in this film are motivated by many things but love certainly does not seem to be one of them. It's a rather tawdry spectacle and very few of the characters do much to earn your sympathy. But there is no denying that it is an enjoyable, compelling film.Henry VIII has been a popular film subject but while he is an important figure here this is not a film about the king. Rather it is the story of two sisters who would end up vying for his affection. The story of Anne Boleyn is well known. But there was another Boleyn girl. Anne's sister Mary may not be nearly as famous in the annals of history but she has her own story to tell. And in this film that story is told and some of it is even true. Yes, this is a film littered with historical inaccuracies. It's not a documentary, it's entertainment and the film takes liberties with the truth to try to make things more interesting. But the gist of the actual historical story is there. And it is quite a story.Natalie Portman plays Anne and her performance is probably the best thing about the film. It's a fascinating character arc to say the least and Portman hits all the right notes. Sweet and charming at times, conniving and ruthless at others. It's a powerful portrayal. Scarlett Johansson has a less showy role as Mary, not getting very many of the big dramatic moments presented to Portman. But her performance is certainly fine and she creates one of the very few sympathetic characters in the film. Mary does things of which she may not be proud but she really had very little choice. While Anne's lust for power is evident you get the sense Mary would have been perfectly happy living out a quiet, nondescript life out in the country. In the end Mary is one of the few who comes out of things able to hold her head relatively high. Since we're dealing with Henry VIII here the fact she holds on to her head at all is probably an achievement.This is a film in which the story grabs you and it will certainly hold your interest throughout. For a period drama it is important to get the costumes and sets right to give things the proper feel and this film certainly does so. It looks spectacular. The film does have its problems though. There are some characters, most notably the sisters' father and especially their uncle, who are absolutely irredeemable louses and their presence at times makes it very hard to embrace the film. The things these two force upon the girls all for the supposed good of the family are deplorable. In their blind quest for power they don't seem to mind the fact that they may well ruin the girls' lives. Whereas Portman and Johansson do fine work one gets the sense that Eric Bana's portrayal of Henry VIII is somewhat lacking. Henry does not come across as powerfully as one might expect. The ruthless streak is there but it seems there's a certain something missing. And while the story is engaging you feel that in the end things are rather rushed. The second half of the film moves at breakneck speed with important historical events flying by as the film hurries to its conclusion. After spending so much time setting up the connection between Henry and the sisters in the first half of the film more time certainly could have been spent to allow things to be properly paid off. All of a sudden the film's over and you're left wanting to see and know more. All in all it's an enjoyable film. Not perfect by any means but entertaining enough and a worthwhile, if not always entirely accurate, look back at a fascinating time in history.",7,0,1,4 March 2009
Elizabeth," The muddled monarchy
","There's a lot going on in this movie. Perhaps there's a bit too much going on. There's so much plotting and scheming that it's hard to keep track of who exactly is plotting with whom. The gist of it is that the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth finds her hold on the throne, and indeed her life, in rather constant danger. Who can she trust? Who is really on her side? Of all the men who vie for her affections is there one who actually loves her? Or is love out of the question, her potential marriage destined to be just part of the political game? A lot of questions and not all of them will be answered in satisfying fashion. The plot of this film is rather untidy and it never seems to quite tie itself together.As a 16th-century English drama this is a film which is obviously going to have a very specific look to it. And the filmmakers capture the period beautifully, the film really does look fantastic. Fabulous sets and costumes bring the period alive. Elizabeth's coronation stands out as one scene which looks particularly magnificent. Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Elizabeth is terrific but not everything which surrounds her works. There are some other excellent performances, most notably from Geoffrey Rush as a man who clearly is on Elizabeth's side and Christopher Eccleston as a man who clearly is not. While those important roles are performed well Joseph Fiennes never entirely convinces in playing Robert Dudley, the one man Elizabeth seems to truly love. And while many more characters, and potential conspirators, wander through the movie few make much of a positive impression and a couple of characters really don't work at all.The movie plays fast and loose with historical facts in an attempt to ratchet up the drama. But the story as presented has much of the drama drained from it by the end. Things get rather muddled and at times hard to follow. By the time the director tries to tidy things up with a Godfather homage (or Godfather ripoff if you're inclined to be less charitable) the film seems to have gotten away from him a bit. Elizabeth has so many potential enemies it's hard to keep track. As the film nears its end the key questions are who is ultimately conspiring with whom and why? As you watch the film you may have a hard time figuring those answers out. The film starts with great promise but as it moves towards its finale rather than building momentum the story seems to fizzle out. At its heart the movie has a wonderful, captivating performance from Blanchett. And the look of the film is wonderful. But there are problems with the story. While certainly intriguing the plot in the end becomes a little too involved for its own good. All in all it's a movie which definitely has some things going for it but which ultimately falls just a touch short of being completely satisfying.",6,1,2,13 August 2009
Batman Returns," The Too Dark Knight
","Tim Burton's first Batman film was widely praised, largely for its serious tone. Serious by comic book movie standards anyway. There was darkness and gloominess in that first film which Burton used to great effect. In Batman Returns Burton upped the ante on the darkness. He went really dark. I mean really, really dark. Way too dark for his movie's good. One can imagine thousands of happy young tykes bouncing into the theater excited to see a Batman movie only to come out two hours later crying their eyes out and headed for an appointment with a child psychologist. Fun for the whole family? Not this movie. This is more horror film than superhero saga. I guess when a movie begins with parents tossing their infant child into a river you can forget about it being a feel-good story. And when that child floats into a sewer and is rescued by penguins we know who our villain's going to be this time around.So it's Penguin. And Burton's concept for this character sinks the movie. What a vile, disgusting creature. A sick, twisted, perverted little man whose diabolical plans, when finally revealed, are almost too awful to comprehend. It's the stuff of nightmares. If Burton was looking to frighten a whole generation of kids he probably succeeded. If he was looking to make a good movie he failed. The Penguin is a depraved character who makes the movie way scarier than any mass-audience comic book movie should be. And aside from the scares parents will probably want to be covering their children's eyes and ears with all the upfront sexual innuendo in the movie. 'Mommy, what's poontang?' This is a Batman movie for crying out loud, you know kids are going to swarm to see it. But Burton made a movie with very grownup sensibilities. OK, so maybe it's too adult, maybe it's not what you really expect a Batman movie to be. But putting that aside there's still the fact that it's simply a bad movie.You feel bad for Danny DeVito who, in playing Penguin, was given a character who wasn't salvageable. Penguin's not the only villain though. There are a couple more and they largely fail too. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Selina Kyle who is of course destined to become Catwoman. How exactly does Selina become Catwoman? Quite ludicrously. Pfeiffer makes the most of what she's got to work with. Catwoman's got her moments which is more than you can say for Penguin who is an off-putting, grotesque abomination from start to finish. Then there's powerful, corrupt Gotham businessman Max Shreck. The best thing that you can say about this character is that he's played by Christopher Walken, who always brings his own unique touch to any film. But Shreck's not particularly interesting, has no backstory to give us a reason to care about him, and he disappears for large portions of the film. Three villains in this case don't add up to much. And oh by the way Michael Keaton's Batman again. Keaton was largely overshadowed by Jack Nicholson's Joker in the first film. But, both as Batman and perhaps more crucially as Bruce Wayne, Keaton contributed a great deal to the first film. Here he really doesn't get a chance to do much of anything at all. Neither Batman nor Bruce ever are really able to grab hold of this movie. It's a dark, gloomy tale of the bad guys, the Penguin in particular. And where Nicholson's Joker infused the first film with so much energy the Penguin sucks the life out of this film. There's very little to enjoy here. Is it so much to ask to have a little fun in a comic book movie? No fun here, just gloom and doom and a movie which really disappoints.",4,1,7,4 October 2011
The Natural," Sentimental schmaltz
","The Natural is not a baseball movie. It's a fable, a fairy tale, a fantasy which just happens to be centered around a baseball player. It probably would have been better as a baseball movie. The movie drowns in sentimentality, few movies have ever laid it on as thick as this one does with its portrayal of the godlike Roy Hobbs. Roy's a mythical superhero. At least that's the effect the movie's going for. Unfortunately this superhero is a complete idiot. All he cares about is baseball and his vain quest to be the best there ever was. Unfortunately his quest is derailed before it ever gets a chance to properly begin. But when years later he somehow gets a second chance he screws it up all over again by making the same exact mistakes he made the first time. Here's a helpful hint for the audience in case you can't figure it out, because Roy sure can't. Woman dressed in black...bad. Woman dressed in white...good. Yes, this is one simplistic fairy tale all right.Aside from all the sentimental overload the movie's other big problem is Robert Redford. Not because Redford gives a bad performance as Roy Hobbs, because he doesn't, but for the simple fact that he is much, much, much too old to believably play the part. Yes the story is about an old man, at least in baseball terms. But not that old. Redford was pushing fifty when he made this movie. He just doesn't look the part as the 35-year old Hobbs we see for most of the movie. And at the start of the movie, when Redford plays Hobbs at the age of nineteen? All the favorable lighting and makeup in the world wasn't going to prevent that from looking truly absurd. It's hard to buy into the movie when the great baseball star looks like your grandpa. For comparison's sake a key role, that of old, cantankerous manager Pop, is played by Wilford Brimley. Brimley is a mere two years older than Redford.So Redford's casting is a problem. The fact that this supposed baseball movie features some truly ridiculous baseball action doesn't help either. Roy Hobbs joins a terrible team. To show you just how terrible the team is the filmmakers resort to comic baseball, players getting hit in the groin and such. Not funny, not at all. If you want to take this seriously as a baseball movie you're in trouble. There's really nothing believable about the baseball sequences. But if it doesn't work as a baseball movie maybe it at least works as a fable? Not really. The movie beats you over the head with the Roy Hobbs as god stuff but it never really rings true. The fact he's such a dunce surely doesn't help. When a woman from Roy's past shows up she has a secret for him. But she doesn't come right out and say it, she only hints at it. But anybody could figure it out. Anybody except dear old Roy. He doesn't get it. He never seems to get it, no matter what 'it' is, unless it's hitting a baseball. That he can do and with remarkable precision, able to hit faraway objects and make them explode whenever the mood strikes him. The character of Roy Hobbs never really works and thus the movie never really works. Redford's acting is fine even if he never looks the part. Many other performers, most notably Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are really wasted, not given enough to do in this totally Roy Hobbs-centered movie. Kim Basinger has a bit more substantial part to play but doesn't really do all that well with it. The film has a great look and sound to it, with beautiful cinematography and a wonderful Randy Newman score. But the story lets the movie down. It's a fable which falls flat, not particularly believable and often, as the movie drags along, not particularly interesting or entertaining. This baseball movie leaves you longing for a real baseball movie.",5,26,42,9 April 2011
The Others," Stylish, subtle scares
","The Others is a ghost story but in this haunted house the scares are quite subtle. This is a movie which, to its great benefit, is more about the story than shocking, scary moments. To be sure there are some good frights sprinkled throughout. But nothing over-the-top. This movie is more interested in making you think than in frightening you. What exactly is going on in this house? It's a mystery the audience will be trying to solve right along with the characters. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, mother of two young children. The three of them live alone in an isolated house on the island of Jersey in the days immediately following the end of World War II. Grace's husband is presumed dead in the war. The family's servants just up and left in the middle of the night. Three new servants arrive at the house. And here things begin to get very interesting.From the moment we meet them there is something slightly off about these new servants. An aging nanny, an elderly gardener and a mute young woman...they're quite the odd trio. But they know the house, having worked there before and Grace welcomes them in. But first Grace must explain the rules for the house, rules designed to keep all sunlight out as the children are so sensitive to the light it would kill them. This makes for a dark atmosphere which adds so much to the film, especially once things start to go bump in the night. Grace's daughter Anne sees the ghosts but Grace herself refuses to believe it. The servants, especially the nanny Mrs. Mills, seem to know more than they are letting on. It's pretty clear these servants hold the movie's secrets. What are those secrets? The fun for us is in finding out. Grace needs to find the answers too but it seems unlikely she'll find much fun in it.Kidman is excellent in playing the loving, protective mother who is thoroughly harried by the unseen intruders in her home. Fionnula Flanagan is also terrific playing the mysterious Mrs. Mills who is somehow creepy even when she's not trying to be. Or maybe she is trying. Also notable are the performances of the young actors playing the children. James Bentley is quite good in playing the boy, Nicholas, but it is Alakina Mann, playing Anne, who is the true revelation. Mann turns in one of the best child acting performances you'll ever see, mature far beyond her years in playing a girl who sees ghosts and is not even freaked out by them, taking it all in her stride. Kudos to director Alejandro Amenábar for coaxing such fine performances from his cast and for creating such a creepy atmosphere. The movie's story is a smart one, building slowly but surely toward its big climax. There are enough hints sprinkled throughout that may let you figure things out before the characters do. So maybe when the ending comes it doesn't pack quite as much of a wallop as it would if you were totally stunned by it. But it is still all in all a very satisfying movie-watching experience. A good story with enough subtle little scares thrown in to keep happy those who are looking for chills and thrills.",7,1,2,18 November 2013
Just Go with It," Just not funny enough
","Just Go with It is less juvenile than many of Adam Sandler's previous works. So that's good. But in a movie which unbelievably stretches to almost two hours in length there are very few laughs. That's bad. Sandler, for the most part, acts like an actual grown-up. But this more mature Sandler doesn't turn out to be a funnier one. This is a hit-and-miss comedy in which the misses definitely outnumber the hits.Sandler plays Danny, a successful, and quite single, Los Angeles plastic surgeon who scores with hot women by using a wedding ring to pretend he's unhappily married. He is quite content with his life of meaningless one-night stands. Then, without his fake ring on, he hooks up with the impossibly hot Palmer. He feels a genuine connection with her. But then she finds the ring, assumes he really is married, and refuses to have anything to do with him. Danny tells her he is about to be divorced, Palmer insists on meeting his supposed wife. Danny concocts a plan, having his office assistant, single mom Katherine, pretend to be his wife. But the plan veers off the rails and Danny ends up having to take the ruse all the way to Hawaii. Danny, Palmer, Katherine and Katherine's kids, who Palmer thinks are also Danny's kids, jet off on their tropical adventure. There's also a very annoying fake boyfriend for Katherine. So much deception. But so few laughs. The setup is seemingly there for some decent screwball comedy. But the movie largely falls flat.The movie is not a total failure. There are some chuckles here and there but no huge laughs. Certainly not enough consistent comedy to maintain the film over its exorbitantly long running time. Sandler is OK. The real standout is Jennifer Aniston, playing Katherine. Aniston has such great comic instincts and is so incredibly charming. It's a shame she doesn't have better material to work with here. Brooklyn Decker is surprisingly good as Palmer. A swimsuit model by trade Decker certainly fills out a bikini quite well. And in this film the camera lingers over her to the extent drooling may be induced from some members of the audience. But Decker proves to be capable of more than looking hot, she actually shows reasonably decent acting chops. She could have a future in this. Heck, she turns in a much better performance here than Nicole Kidman does. Kidman shows up halfway through the film and you'll wish she hadn't. She mails in a terrible performance and her character brings a bad vibe to the proceedings. She's a villain in a film which didn't need one. Nick Swardson, playing Katherine's fake boyfriend with a fake German accent, is grating to the extreme. And just when you think he can't be any worse he has an excruciatingly unfunny encounter with a sheep. The less said about that the better. The children are rather annoying as well. It's hard to produce a likable comedy when there are so many characters you don't like. Sandler, Aniston and Decker do the best they can but everyone and everything else fails. The comedy never hits it big. The plot fizzles out rather quickly and there's more than a hint of obviousness to it. It's not hard to guess where the story is headed. That wouldn't be so bad if there were a lot of great laughs along the way. But those laughs are not there.",5,1,1,9 August 2015
Orphan," There's something wrong with Orphan
","Yes, as the movie's tagline states, there most certainly is something wrong with Esther. Unfortunately there's something wrong with the movie too. It's a movie which starts out with some real promise but as the story plods along that early promise never really pays itself off. The movie checks in at a clearly excessive 123 minutes, the story simply can't sustain itself over that length of time. Oftentimes the movie has a very formulaic feel to it, there's the sense we've seen this all done before. And we've probably seen it done a lot better. By the time we finally get to the shocking conclusion we just may not be that interested anymore. And the big shock really doesn't work either if you actually spend a moment thinking about it. The whole movie is based on a foundation which is not particularly plausible. Suspended disbelief works to a point I guess but honestly this movie asks us to believe things which quite simply could not happen.The best thing this movie has to offer is the performance of the young actress playing our deeply troubled Esther. Isabelle Fuhrman turns in a wildly impressive, appropriately sinister and almost impossibly mature performance. This is a young actress who almost certainly has great things in her future. Unfortunately much of what surrounds her doesn't work. It's a story about an evil little child who is clearly not what she initially appears to be. What is she exactly? Well that's the revelation we save for the big shock at the end. But this movie spends way too much time getting to its big finish. And again the big revelation really does not stand up to even the most cursory of examinations. But it's just a cheap little horror film so maybe if we don't think about it too much...nah, the movie still doesn't work. Even if you ignore the story's ultimate implausibility the movie still has too many other flaws. It's way too long. There are entirely too many of those standard horror movie false scares and not enough real ones. One of the key characters, Esther's adopted father, comes off as being quite a dunce. Horror movies rely on tension, this movie's tension fizzles out long before the movie finally slogs to an end. By the time the movie's halfway done you're just looking for it to be over. Full marks to young Isabelle Fuhrman for creating a creepy, memorable character. But one good character does not necessarily make a good movie.",5,6,10,29 January 2010
The Hustler," It's a scratch
","Esteemed as a classic The Hustler doesn't match the hype. There is not near enough entertainment on offer here to stretch across the film's much too long running time. The film takes place in the dingy, seedy world of pool, with all its gambling and boozing. It makes for a rather dark film. There is a little bit of fun to be had in the beginning as we're introduced to small-time hustler Fast Eddie Felson. Eddie yearns to be big-time and to do that he's got to beat the best. And Minnesota Fats is the best. We see Eddie and Fats play a thoroughly compelling game of pool. But for the film it's all downhill from there. Things get too dark, too bleak. There is nothing to enjoy. The film tells an interesting story to be sure. But that story is ever so hard to embrace, it's quite a sordid tale. Ultimately The Hustler leaves you with a sinking feeling in your gut. This is a rather unpleasant movie-watching experience.Paul Newman, as Eddie, and Jackie Gleason, as Fats, give fine performances. Newman makes Eddie into a compelling, if thoroughly flawed, hero. Gleason doesn't have much screen time but he makes the most of every moment, having such a great presence about him. Unfortunately the good work of Newman and Gleason is undermined by what surrounds them. The character of Bert Gordon, unscrupulous gambler, drags the film into the muck. George C. Scott plays the role and there's nothing wrong with the performance. Scott makes Bert into what the script calls for him to be. Unfortunately what the script calls for Bert to be is a vile, miserable, reprehensible human being. Hearing Bert, a man who has no character whatsoever, lecture Eddie about his lack of character will have you shaking your head. Bert is so repugnant his presence makes the entire film distasteful.Then there's Sarah, a young alcoholic woman who falls into a relationship with Eddie. Piper Laurie plays this part and, as with Scott, there's nothing to fault about the performance. The character just doesn't work properly, she's not entirely believable. She seems to exist only to teach Eddie life lessons. And Eddie does indeed learn much about himself by the time the film ends. But for the viewer it's been a rather unsatisfying journey. The film is slow, plodding and bleak to the point of being outright depressing. The film started with great promise. You thought that even in those dingy pool halls there might be some bright enjoyment to be had. There was not. This film gives you precious little to enjoy. Newman does the best he can to carry the film but ultimately he, and we, are let down by the story. The Hustler unfolds in a very dark world. Sadly, that darkness overwhelms the film.",4,4,11,19 July 2015
Terminator Salvation," Milking the cash cow
","When last we left this movie franchise Terminator 3, in addition to being a rather terrible movie, had rendered Terminators 1 and 2 completely irrelevant by declaring that Judgement Day and the war with the machines was inevitable. No fate but what we make? Yeah, never mind that. There is a fate and that fate sucks. So here we are in this latest movie, Judgement Day has come and gone, the world is a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland and the few humans left struggle in their fight against the machines. Well, if nothing else the few glimpses we got of this war in the previous movies were intriguing. Maybe they could make something out of this. No, they couldn't.This movie is an example of a terrible idea even more terribly executed. The story begins with John Connor leading an assault on a Skynet base. The base gets blown up real good in a nuclear explosion. Only one person survives. Surprise! The one survivor is John Connor. Convenient. Showing no ill effects from having survived a freaking nuclear explosion Connor goes merrily about his business of being the savior of humankind. Well not so merrily actually as Christian Bale portrays Connor as the most morose, uninspiring 'hero' anyone's ever seen. Dude's so lame you almost want to root for Skynet. Speaking of Skynet these machines apparently haven't gotten any smarter since the previous movies. They still want to kill John Connor. They still fail miserably at it. This time they have an absurdly convoluted plan involving some Terminator-ish creation of theirs. This creation is Marcus, who when we first meet him is a death row inmate about to be executed in 2003. Then he wakes up fifteen years later and...well, a bunch of nonsense happens.Anyhow this new character of Marcus could have been intriguing but he got shoved aside when Bale stomped his feet like a petulant little child and insisted he play John Connor. So Connor came to the forefront and boy does the movie suffer for it. The Connor character is a dud. After hearing so much about this great leader and savior when we finally see him in action what a letdown it is. Is it Bale's performance or is it the character himself? Who knows? Whatever it is the character doesn't work. Sam Worthington, playing Marcus, certainly comes across better than Bale does but that's really not saying much. A young Kyle Reese shows up. Anton Yelchin plays that part and he probably does better than anyone else in this mess of a movie. The tough female heroine role this time goes to Moon Bloodgood. Linda Hamilton she ain't. What a horrible, horrible actress. Every time she opens her mouth you cringe. The movie also features an exceedingly pregnant Bryce Dallas Howard who gets absolutely nothing worthwhile to do. Of course the one person the movie most significantly does not feature is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Making a Terminator movie without Arnold? Bad idea. Bad, bad idea. Whatever killing machine Skynet may conjure up it ain't gonna be as cool as Arnold. And heaven knows there are plenty of killing machines, including some giant monstrosities which apparently got lost on their way to the Transformers set. All the show-off visual effects can't hide the fact that the story stinks. And after sitting through this rather awful movie, just when you think it can't possibly get any worse it does. The ending is ludicrously, absurdly, laughably bad. And you can see it coming a mile away too. I hope whoever wrote that ending had their paycheck bounce. Would serve them right. Mind-blowing in its stupidity. It's the final insult in a movie which insults the audience's intelligence as well as insulting the legacy of the first two Terminator movies everyone loved so much. Terminator 3 started this franchise down a slippery slope. This movie drove the franchise off a cliff. But as long as there is money to be milked from the Terminator cash cow you know there are more of these movies to come. Heaven help us.",4,2,5,19 January 2012
Insomnia," Nowhere near Nolan's best but still quite good
","Insomnia is probably the least of Christopher Nolan's films. That's not all that surprising when you consider it's not an original Nolan work but a remake of an earlier Norwegian film. What also should not be surprising is that even a lesser Christopher Nolan film is still a really good film. The guy doesn't make bad movies. Insomnia may lack the uniqueness of his original works. But this movie still has a compelling story to tell. And Nolan is more than up to the challenge of delivering that story in a fashion which is both entertaining and thought-provoking.The story centers around Los Angeles police detective Will Dormer who along with his partner has traveled to a small Alaskan town to assist with a murder investigation. Dormer is a notably famous cop, a hero, but left behind in Los Angeles is an internal affairs investigation which threatens to undo his life's work. As he lands in Alaska this weighs heavily on his mind. And things are about to get a whole lot worse. In the course of hunting down the Alaskan killer Dormer makes a huge, catastrophic mistake. If discovered this error really will bring Dormer's life crashing down. Crucially none of the Alaskan police he works with know what he has done. Unfortunately for Dormer one person does know: the killer. And now the killer sees himself as Dormer's partner. They're going to help one another get away with their respective misdeeds. Wracked by guilt, in a terrible moral quandary, what will Dormer do? He really is in a terrible state, made much worse by the fact he can't sleep at all. What's really keeping him awake? Is it the perpetual Alaskan sunlight? Or is it his own guilty conscience?The role of Dormer is pretty much perfect for Al Pacino who brings both a sense of authority and a great weariness to the role. Dormer, successful though he may be, is really being beaten down by life and up in Alaska things are only getting worse. The guy is crumbling and Pacino captures that very well. The other key performance comes from Robin Williams who shows up halfway through the film inhabiting a character who is quite unlike anything you'd expect from this particular actor. The film provides a chance for Williams to show off some serious acting chops and he delivers. Pacino and Williams play off one another brilliantly, the tension between their two characters is palpable and it drives the film forward. Hilary Swank has an important role as well, playing a young Alaskan police officer who idolizes Dormer but who does a little digging and realizes there may be some very bad things the famous detective has hidden away. To what lengths will Dormer go to protect those dangerous secrets? That is the crux of this film's plot. It's not your typical good guy/bad guy story. The lines between good and bad are not just blurred, they're completely wiped away. It's a smart story which really grabs you. And the film is photographed beautifully. The light might be forever shining but there is true darkness lurking here. Story, performances, photography...everything comes together very well. Even in a film which is not nearly his best effort Christopher Nolan produces something quite excellent.",7,1,2,23 October 2014
500 Days of Summer," The love story that's not a love story
","This is not a love story. The narrator tells us so right at the beginning. We meet our two central characters, our two lovebirds, and know immediately that their relationship is doomed to fail. As the film's title suggests the movie takes place over 500 days. But we begin near the end, day 488 to be precise. The love story that's not really a love story has already run its course. We see the end and then we are taken back to the beginning, day one. After that we're all over the place, constantly jumping forward and back in time, a jumbled mess of memories as a man remembers the good times and bad of the love affair that broke his heart.The man with the broken heart is Tom, a man who trained as an architect only to wind up as a greeting card writer. He's a good-hearted guy, a man who is a fervent believer in the idea of true love. And when Summer shows up he's sure he has found the love of his life. Summer's a seemingly sweet girl. She's charming, quirky, offbeat. Kind of like the movie itself. And for that matter like the actress who plays the part, Zooey Deschanel. As you watch the movie play itself out it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Summer. Deschanel is utterly perfect. But as great as Deschanel is, as compelling as her character may be, this movie is about Tom. We're seeing the story from his perspective. We're rooting for him. For the movie to work the actor playing this part was always going to be the real key. Happily, Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a terrific job. Through all the highs and lows of the Tom and Summer relationship Gordon-Levitt captures wonderfully the emotions Tom is feeling in each moment. When Tom's heart breaks yours breaks right along with him.From the moment he first laid eyes on her Tom saw Summer as the perfect woman. That was his first mistake. Nobody's perfect. Summer has her obvious charms but what's really hidden away behind the dazzling smile and big, blue eyes? Right at the start Summer tells Tom she does not believe in true love. Tom ignores this at his own peril. Tom and Summer seem to make a great couple but they want different things out of life, out of each other. Sure there are some good times along the way but it can't last. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry, playing off one another beautifully. Seeing them together makes you desperately wish this was a love story. But it's not. And the way the movie jumps around in time puts a smart, well-played twist on the story. We can see the best time in the relationship, the highest of highs. And then immediately jump forward to the lowest of lows. A great illustration of how fragile something seemingly so perfect can really be. Where did it all go wrong? Tom's trying to sort it out inside his head and we're right there with him. This is a movie about a doomed relationship, about a man who had his heart shredded to pieces. But, no doubt helped by the two great lead performances, it's charming nonetheless. It's not a spectacular movie but it's certainly enjoyable and clever too. It's a movie which puts some unique twists on the typical love story. The biggest twist being that it's not really a love story at all.",7,0,1,7 May 2011
Juno," A nice little movie
","Every once in a while there comes along a nice little movie which becomes a cultural phenomenon. When this happens all perspective tends to get lost and amidst all the breathless hype people overlook the fact that it's really just a nice little movie. And then comes the inevitable backlash as those who didn't like the movie get fed up with all the hype and declare it to be the worst thing they've ever seen. Such is the case with Juno. It's not the best movie of the year. It's not revolutionary. And it's certainly not the abomination its detractors would have you believe it to be. It's a nice little movie.Seeing as the movie's a cultural phenomenon and all a plot summary seems rather unnecessary. Everyone knows the story...teenage girl gets pregnant and decides to give the baby up for adoption to childless yuppie couple. It's an incredibly simple story which plays out in such a way that the movie ends up being rather enjoyable and entertaining. Screenwriter Diablo Cody took home an Academy Award for her efforts but the film really is not brilliantly scripted. It is however brilliantly performed with director Jason Reitman coaxing wonderful performances out of his talented cast. All the performers are spot-on, falling into their roles perfectly. Of course the most important role belongs to Ellen Page playing Juno. The whole enterprise would have been sunk if Page was not up to the task but she does a truly outstanding job. With Page holding everything together everyone else around her offers brilliant support. Michael Cera as Juno's best friend (who happens to be her baby's father) is terrific. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney have some very witty moments and some very loving moments as Juno's parents who are rather understanding given the circumstances. As the prospective adoptive parents Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman do a great job in bringing to life two characters who have very different motivations, hopes and dreams. It's apparent as soon as we meet this couple that something may not be quite right and Garner and Bateman are pitch-perfect as the couple's story plays itself out.So what we have is a simple but ultimately surprising and charming story. And that story is brought to life wonderfully by the cast who make it so easy to embrace these characters. As always seems to be the case in these teen movies music plays a key role and so many of the songs chosen here fit the film perfectly. It really is a very good movie. But is it truly as great as the hype would lead you to believe? Probably not. It's a movie which certainly has its flaws. The script may have won an Oscar but too often it seems Cody is trying way too hard to make her teenage characters sound cool or quirky. There's only so much 'cool' teen dialogue one can take. Honest to blog. For her next script one hopes Cody will realize not every line has to be a potential catchphrase. Sometimes people, even 'cool' teenagers, just need to talk like normal people. And again the story is not at all a deep one, in fact it's often rather mundane. With a lesser cast and director this movie could have been entirely unremarkable. It's the performers which inject life into this story and it is the performances more than the story itself which you will really cherish. If you go into it expecting the best movie of the year you almost can't help but be disappointed. But if you have realistic expectations you'll find that this is a rather enjoyable and charming movie. It's not the greatest movie you've ever seen. It's a nice little movie. And there's nothing wrong with that.",7,1,5,23 June 2008
L.A. Confidential," A fascinating look at life in the big city
","Give a collection of great actors a great story to work with and you are likely to end up with something rather special. Such is the case with L.A. Confidential. The boldface names jump off the page...Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, James Cromwell and, in his first big-time role, Guy Pearce. And none of these big names are just mailing it in, here to collect a paycheck. They're all on top of their games, undoubtedly helped to no small extent by the wonderfully nuanced and utterly intriguing story.This story takes place in 1950s Los Angeles but this is a side of L.A. most people don't get to see. Behind all the Hollywood glamour L.A. has a seamy side which will be the focus of this tale. At the heart of the movie are three cops who ostensibly are supposed to be working together but who go about the business of dispensing justice in very different ways. Crowe plays aggressive hothead Bud White. Spacey is Jack Vincennes, who takes more pride in his work as an adviser on a popular television cop drama than he does in his actual police work. And Pearce plays Edmund Exley, a young up-and-comer in the department who plays things by the book. As we will soon see Exley is rather unique in an LAPD which believes in doing whatever is necessary to bring the guilty to justice. Even if it means becoming a little guilty themselves.The movie really begins to move forward with a massacre at a coffee shop. It seems a pretty cut and dried case but initial appearances can be deceiving. Soon White, Vincennes and Exley will find themselves caught up in a maze of lies, deception and mystery. It will be a great test for these very different men as it appears they may well need each other's unique talents to solve this puzzle. And quite the elaborate puzzle it is. One important piece is Lynn Bracken, a high class call girl played by Basinger. Tying together many of this complex story's strands is gossip writer Sid Hudgens who is played with appropriate sleaziness by DeVito. And in the background the whole time is the somewhat mysterious Captain Dudley Smith, played by Cromwell. Here is a man who believes in bringing the guilty to justice by any means necessary. That's all well and good if you know who the guilty are but in L.A. Confidential you're never quite sure who to believe. The viewer is guessing right along with the investigators on the screen. And in the end it all comes together and pays off brilliantly.L.A. Confidential is first and foremost a great story, with many fascinating twists and turns along the way. The film also serves as a showcase for some of this generation's finest acting talents. Each of the main characters is wonderfully unique and each of the actors involved does a terrific job in bringing those characters to life. These are complex characters in a complex tale. It's so involved that the acting had to be stellar if this film was going to work and none of the stars disappoint. Terrific storytelling brought to life by a collection of inspired performances makes L.A. Confidential an absolute winner.",8,96,110,19 August 2005
Match Point," Unlikeable characters make this film hard to embrace
","Match Point has a pretty interesting story to tell. In fact after seeing the way it ultimately unfolds it would be fair to say the story is ingeniously crafted. All of the principal actors in the film do solid, if not spectacular, work. There's nothing here that you would call a bad performance. So we have a good story told in a very clever way. And we have solid acting all around. Good story, good acting...this film must be a winner right? Well, not so much. And why is that? It's simply because this may be collectively the most unlikeable cast of characters ever thrown up on the big screen. By the time the film plays out you will come to the sad realization that there is nobody here to root for, not a single character in this film worthy of your respect, much less your admiration. The characters range from selfish to arrogant to immoral to downright criminal. So for all the good things Match Point has going for it these characters are so unembraceable by the time the film is over you can't wait to be rid of the whole lot of them. And that is not a recipe for making a film which will be remembered fondly.Now if you don't mind a film in which all the characters are covered in varied amounts of sleaze there is much to recommend this film. It is a really good, and ultimately very surprising, story. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays the lead role of Chris, a former tennis pro who is now a tennis instructor. He gives a lesson to a wealthy young man, Tom, whose sister, Chloe, takes a liking to Chris and so the romantic entanglements begin. Seeing the potential financial benefits if nothing else Chris enters into a relationship with Chloe even though he, understandably since the character is played by Scarlett Johansson, finds himself much more attracted to struggling American actress Nola who happens to be Tom's fiancée. Oh what a tangled web we weave. The actors playing the Tom and Chloe parts, Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer respectively, are fine but the real spark in this film comes whenever Meyers and Johansson are together. Johansson simply oozes sex appeal and it is a pleasure to watch her Nola work her charms on Chris. But as you might imagine given the tangled web of relationships here there are inevitably, shall we say, complications. And if you hadn't already been turned off by the rampaging selfishness and immorality of all of these characters the final act will simply make your jaw drop. These are very bad people, rotten to the core, and it is hard to find reason to sympathize with any of them. Given a choice you probably wouldn't want to spend five minutes with any of the characters in this film. In Match Point you are condemned to spend two hours with all of them. If you spent that much time around these characters in real life you'd probably feel as if you needed to take a shower afterwards to wipe away the stench.",5,5,9,3 August 2006
Yes Man," Good enough to say yes to
","Yes Man is a movie which can both entertain and surprise you. It's a Jim Carrey comedy so we know what that entails right? Carrey going way over the top, exaggerated physical antics, the rubber face stretching in every conceivable direction. Anything for a laugh, that's a Jim Carrey movie. Except it's not this Jim Carrey movie. Carrey reins himself in a bit. This is less a Jim Carrey movie and more a breezy romantic comedy which happens to star Jim Carrey. Even with a premise, a character who has to say yes to everything, which seems to set the movie up for all kinds of outrageous, and likely juvenile, shenanigans the movie doesn't go in that direction. OK, there's one unfortunate incident with an old lady. But other than that Carrey's character is saying yes to more mundane things. He says yes to guitar lessons and Korean language classes. Nothing uproariously funny there but things which will pay themselves off in smart ways later. That's what this movie is. Nothing to make you bust a gut laughing but enough to keep you entertained.On the surface the plot seems to harken back to Carrey's Liar Liar but the movie and Carrey himself don't go to the extremes we saw in that one. This time there's nothing magical or mystical going on as with the man who absolutely could not tell a lie. Carrey plays bank loan officer Carl who has lost in the game of love and retreated into his own little shell. He says no to everything. He says no to life itself. Until a friend drags him to a seminar run by some weirdo guru-type who preaches the power of saying Yes! Carl vows to begin saying yes to everything. Here you expect the movie to start its inevitable flight off the deep end. But no. Carl's first chance to say yes sees him giving a homeless man a ride. This leads him to a meeting with the exceedingly quirky, scooter-riding Allison, played by Zooey Deschanel. Will Carl say yes to falling in love with Allison. Uh, didn't I just mention Allison is played by Zooey Deschanel? Duh, you don't have to have a yes-saying covenant to fall in love with her. From there it's a pretty formulaic romantic comedy. The movie's got enough humor and, helped immeasurably by the wondrous Deschanel, plenty of charm. The jokes and gags aren't huge, certainly not as outrageous as you'd expect in a Carrey comedy, but the more subtle humor works well for this movie. You're not just waiting for the next big Carrey explosion, this movie actually gives you reason to care about its story and its characters. Carrey and Deschanel have great chemistry and it is oh so easy to root for the Carl and Allison relationship to succeed. As in any rom-com there will be complications in the relationship. But there's never really any great drama, no real doubts as to how the story will turn out. But even if the ending has a tinge of inevitability to it the movie has a good time getting there. Not a great comedy but a good one. Pleasant and charming, likely to bring a smile to the face. A more relaxed, restrained Jim Carrey can still be funny. And Zooey Deschanel can be whatever she wants to be, she's that good. Pair them up and you have a movie worth saying yes to.",6,0,1,11 May 2012
Zodiac," Great cast, great drama, great movie
","One of the most famous serial killer mysteries of all time gets the big-budget Hollywood treatment. And director David Fincher does a magnificent job in bringing this fascinating story to the screen. From its shocking, bloody beginning all the way to its conclusion more than two and a half hours later this film has an energy to it which never wanes. There are a few genuine frights sprinkled throughout but this is no typical serial killer slasher flick. The Zodiac killer does all of his bloody work very early on in the film. From there the tension and drama comes from the chase, as a wide array of characters become involved in the quest to uncover this killer's identity. The killer himself remains in the shadows, the film is really about those who pursued him. But it is not only the police who are on the hunt. A newspaper reporter and, of all things, a political cartoonist find themselves swept up in the unfolding drama.Robert Graysmith is the San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist and the story unfolds mostly from his perspective. Young and initially rather naive nobody takes Graysmith particularly seriously at first. But his dogged determination, which segues into complete obsession, pays off as he is able to piece together key parts of the Zodiac puzzle. Along for the journey is Chronicle reporter Paul Avery, a man who has his own personal demons. His efforts to solve the case will eventually be undermined by his inability to remain sober but for much of the film Graysmith and Avery make an unusual but reasonably effective investigative team. Of course there are a great many characters on the police end of the investigation as well. Chief among them are San Francisco police detectives David Toschi and William Armstrong. The toll the Zodiac investigation takes on these men will be obvious. Unlike the newspapermen, for Toschi and Armstrong this case was their responsibility, their life. And the frustrations are understandably sometimes too much to bear.There are so many important characters here and a marvelous casting job is what, more than anything else, allows the film to really come together. Every actor, in roles large and small, falls into their roles perfectly. The central role of Graysmith goes to Jake Gyllenhaal and he does a wonderful job in portraying this character's evolution from a young, inexperienced nobody to a strong, confident, determined figure. If you could not take this character seriously, the movie inevitably would fail. Gyllenhaal ensures that will not be a concern. Robert Downey Jr. portrays Avery and in a film which sometimes needs a lighter touch he provides that until his character begins his decline. As the lead investigators, Toschi and Armstrong, Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards are both excellent. The case obviously had a profound effect on the lives of these two men and Ruffalo and Edwards do great work in showing the impact the Zodiac had on the men who pursued him. The four actors mentioned here had the largest roles but there are so many other fine performances throughout. Cops, reporters, victims, family members and even a suspect or two...so many roles to play and everyone in the cast performed beautifully.As the director, Fincher does a magnificent job guiding his terrific cast through the film's long journey. It is a story with many twists and turns. Leads are pursued, suspects come and go, it's a maze of information but you never feel lost while watching the film. And Fincher has created a tremendous atmosphere in which to tell his story. Locations, music, wardrobe...everything about the film has the perfect feel of late 1960s/early 1970s San Francisco. This story unfolds in a very specific and very unique time and place in history and Fincher has done a magnificent job of capturing that. Even at over two and a half hours long the film never drags. There is great drama and tension throughout and some truly chilling moments along the way. Having an undeniably fascinating story to work with Fincher crafted a truly fascinating film.",8,1,1,4 May 2009
The Prestige," Wonderfully intricate story makes this one a winner
","Once you get all the twists and turns of the plot sorted out in your head (and doing so will undoubtedly require multiple viewings) only then will you really be able to appreciate just how brilliantly conceived the story in The Prestige is. Going back to their earlier film, Memento, writer/director Christopher Nolan, along with his co-writer and brother Jonathan, have shown a unique talent for creating mind-bending, thought-provoking films which leave you wanting to see them again and again to unravel all the story's mysteries. The Prestige may not quite be up to the level of Memento but it certainly stands in its own right as another superior effort by the brothers Nolan.Probably the less said about the plot here the better. Better to allow you to unravel the story yourself. The basics...the story follows two magicians performing in Europe circa 1900. Initially friends they will soon become bitter rivals in a tale of true obsession. As presented in the film, the story jumps around in time which is a key piece of what in the end is a masterfully constructed puzzle. Because of the skewed time line, at times we know more than the characters and at other times we know less. It makes it all the more enjoyable when all the various story lines and time lines converge and finally we, and the film's characters, finally know the whole story.As one might imagine just by looking at the cast list The Prestige is filled with tremendous performances. As the two key magicians Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both do a wonderful job of bringing their respective characters to life. Bale is perfect as the quiet, dark and brooding Alfred Borden while Jackman is similarly spot-on as the more showy and ultimately obsessive Robert Angier. Michael Caine is reliably brilliant in his supporting role as magician's assistant Cutter, inventor of illusions. Scarlett Johansson plays a stage assistant and while her role requires her to do little more than look pretty she is certainly up to that task and makes the most of what opportunities the script provides her. Everyone else in the wide and varied cast falls into their roles well, including David Bowie whose appearance as a brilliant scientist screams out 'stunt casting!' but who performs his part wonderfully and fits right in with the rest of this terrific ensemble. A truly great cast really brings this story to life.While the story is beautifully crafted the one minor quibble one may have is that this story doesn't have quite as much heart as say, The Illusionist, that other circa 1900 European magicians movie to come out in 2006. The Prestige no doubt has a better story, much more involved and complex. But while you can appreciate the story in The Prestige you may find it much more easy to embrace the story in The Illusionist. It's a subtle difference. Both films are tremendously well done and definitely well worth your while. If you're looking for a terrific story, one that will make you think, one that is ultimately surprising and thrilling, you will find few films which fit that bill better than The Prestige.",8,3,5,12 July 2007
The Terminator," Good? Yes. Great? Hmmmmm...
","Is it heresy to suggest that The Terminator may be a tad overrated? That perhaps fans who so love the whole Terminator saga and mythology remember the original film as being a little better than it actually was? This low budget sci-fi action thriller is certainly an enjoyable film. And considering the franchise it spawned and all the other films it so obviously influenced it's also an important film. But does that necessarily make it a truly great film? Probably not. It's a good film, very good in spots, but there are enough things holding it back to leave it a touch shy of greatness.By now most everyone knows the film's story so a plot rehash seems rather unnecessary. In a nutshell a cyborg Terminator is sent back from the future to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of the as yet unborn human resistance leader who in that post-apocalyptic future will lead the fight against the machines which seek to exterminate humanity. Convoluted? You bet. Of course the Terminator has not come from the future alone. Human resistance fighter Kyle Reese has been sent back to protect Sarah. He must stop the unstoppable Terminator. Good luck with that. Shootouts and car chases and explosions ensue. Plot? Story? Dialogue? Sorry, don't have much for you here. But have I mentioned the explosions? Everyone likes seeing things get blown up right?As I've implied, after the story initially sets itself up there really isn't much of a story at all. The whole movie is one big chase. Certainly there are moments of great excitement but in between the big moments...well there's often not much. At times things are rather sluggish. But there's enough good stuff here to make this at least an enjoyable flick if not some kind of all-time classic film. Of course there are some very memorable characters starting with the Terminator himself (itself?), played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. As a stiff, robotic, inhuman, largely mute killing machine Schwarzenegger's perfect. I'm not sure if that says much for Schwarzenegger's acting ability but for this role in this movie who could be better? The Terminator doesn't have much to say but whenever he does speak you remember it. Seriously, it seems every line Arnold speaks in the movie turned into a catchphrase. Sarah Connor is a character who undergoes a serious evolution in the course of the film and Linda Hamilton portrays that wonderfully. From the sweet, innocent girl at the film's beginning to something else entirely by film's end Hamilton traces the character's journey terrifically. Schwarzenegger and Hamilton are remembered best but it may actually be Michael Biehn who gives the best performance of all as Kyle Reese. It is left to his character to explain to Sarah, and by extension to us, what the heck this movie is actually about. No small task that, making a truly preposterous, unbelievable story sound convincing. Now if you stop and think about that story you will realize there are plot holes large enough to drive an exploding tanker truck through. Time travel stories have their own peculiar issues. Paradoxes and all that. And this film's got a doozy of a paradox. So don't think about it. Just enjoy the movie for what it is. Even if it's not truly as great as it is generally remembered to be what it is ain't bad at all.",7,0,3,9 November 2010
Cloverfield," So very stupid
","Cloverfield is what The Blair Witch Project would have been had Blair Witch been set in Manhattan and also been completely terrible. This movie is brain-dead, an insult to the viewer's intelligence. Perhaps you are willing to accept the basic premise of a giant, indestructible monster rampaging through Manhattan. OK, fine. But that doesn't excuse everything else in the movie which, by and large, is complete and utter nonsense. Things happen which simply cannot happen. Characters do and say things they absolutely could not or would not do. It's a giant mess of implausibility, absurdity and stupidity. And inanity. Let's not forget the inanity. As well as insulting your intelligence it may well also assault your sense of common decency. Manhattan skyscrapers crumble, people flee in terror from the ensuing debris clouds...gee, now where have I seen that before? In fact, the filmmakers actually brag about having studied 9/11 footage to make sure they got the look just right. Some people really have no shame. And why does it always have to be New York City anyway? You'd think just once one of these giant movie monsters would wash ashore in Boston or Miami or some random small town in Delaware. But then of course we'd be deprived of the sight of the Statue of Liberty's head lying on the ground. Because that's real original.Absolutely the only positive thing you can say about this movie is that the visual effects are for the most part very well done. The story is stupid. The scary moments are a lot less scary than the filmmakers would have hoped. The main characters are so boring, annoying or moronic (or all three) that you may well be rooting for the monster to chomp them in half. A special mention for the character of Hud, who also serves as the shaky-cam operator documenting events. Stuck as he is behind the camera for most of the movie you hardly ever see him. And yet he still manages to be one of the most annoying characters in movie history. The guy just will not shut up. And he apparently has an IQ of approximately 12. On and on this blabbermouth goes with absolutely nothing useful to say. Certainly nothing funny to say even though the character is apparently meant to serve as comic relief. Just another way in which Cloverfield fails miserably. T.J. Miller is the actor playing Hud and I will be doing my best to avoid anything he appears in going forward. He's beyond terrible, the rest of the cast isn't much better. Probably the only one to come away with any credit at all is Lizzy Caplan who you get the sense is wondering what the heck she is doing here. Her performance gives off the 'I know this is a terrible movie, I'm sorry' vibe. In fact Caplan has since stated that she signed on for the movie not knowing anything about it and in the future she would not do a film without knowing full well what it is. Smart girl. If you decide to watch this movie knowing full well what it is that's your problem. Personally I'm ashamed that I wasted 90 minutes of my life on this garbage.",4,3,6,8 April 2011
Gettysburg," Epic battle, epic film
","At well over four hours in length it is easy to criticize Gettysburg as being too long a film. Yes, there are some pieces here and there which could have been cut to provide a more reasonable running time. But you also realize that there was so much more which could have been put into the film. Even with its exorbitant length it can be said the film only begins to scratch the surface of the epic Battle of Gettysburg. The film focuses on a few key events in the sprawling three day battle, most famously and effectively the second day attack on Little Round Top and the final day's climactic Pickett's Charge. Even at four hours-plus there is no room for some critically important elements of the battle. Really each of the battle's three days could have been its own movie which is probably why the film was first conceived as a miniseries. Once the decision was made to make it a theatrical release a delicate balance was necessary. Make it long enough to fit everything in but not so long that nobody will want to sit through it. There may be some minor quibbles with how that balance was ultimately achieved but by and large the story of this great battle is presented about as well as you could have hoped.The film takes a little while setting itself up, providing historical background and letting viewers know the stakes as Union and Confederate troops converged on Gettysburg. Given how long the film would ultimately end up running it probably could have gotten to the start of the actual battle a little quicker. But once the first shots are fired the film has you in its grip and holds you there throughout. The battle's first day, both in history and in this film, is somewhat overshadowed by the more famous events of the following two days. But day one has its own stories to tell and those stories are presented very well here. The key figure of the day is Union Brigadier General John Buford, portrayed wonderfully by Sam Elliott. Buford's troops hold their key position, setting the stage for the incredibly dramatic events to come.The star of day two is Colonel Joshua Chamberlain whose 20th Maine regiment leads the famous Union defense of Little Round Top. The film has taken the time to allow us to get to know Chamberlain. This makes it all the more compelling when he leads his men into battle. Jeff Daniels does a truly amazing job in portraying this heroic man. The repeated Confederate assaults on Little Round Top and the response of Chamberlain and his men combine to provide one of the best battle scenes ever filmed. It is more than just the high point of this film, it is as good as anything you will ever see in any war film.It takes something truly spectacular to follow up Little Round Top. Day three at Gettysburg brought us Pickett's Charge. Perhaps the true drama here comes before the charge begins. Lieutenant General James Longstreet knows the charge cannot succeed, the attack is hopeless. But he has his orders. The anguish on his face as he gives the order to proceed tells it all. He knows he is ordering men to certain death. Tom Berenger captures Longstreet's pain beautifully, the man unable to even verbalize the order to attack. A simple, woeful nod of the head sends men to their doom. The attack may have been folly but the bravery of the men who performed it was amazing and the film's portrayal of their march toward aptly-named Cemetery Ridge does the men justice. Another brilliant battle scene to bring the film to a close.Most war films try to invest you in the personal stories of a few combatants to ensure you feel an emotional tie to them as they face great peril. This film has so much ground to cover there is not much time for that sort of thing. We get to know Chamberlain a bit and there is something made of the prewar friendship between Confederate General Armistead and Union General Hancock. Richard Jordan plays Armistead and gives a wonderful speech reminding you of the human stories behind the slaughter in Gettysburg's fields. But there are few of these personal moments. The scale of the battle, and thus of the film, is just too big. The film by and large has to focus on the fighting itself rather than those doing the fighting. There are a few occasions where the film steps away from the fighting in which the film starts to drag a bit. But no film this long was ever going to be without a few slower moments. The film has more than enough big moments to make up for any lulls. It has wonderful performances as well. Daniels, as Chamberlain, is the standout but the likes of Berenger, Jordan and Elliott all have their moments as does Stephen Lang as Pickett. And of course the most famous figure at Gettysburg was Robert E. Lee and Martin Sheen, seemingly an odd choice for the part, does well in the role. It was a literal cast of thousands and every man played his part. They all combined to bring history alive in an epic film about three of America's most epic days.",7,1,2,27 May 2013
We Were Soldiers," Into the heart of a movie battle like no other
","It is hard to stand out and be a unique war film. They've been making war films pretty much since the invention of film it seems. So you would think by now that it's all been done before, and for the most part it has. Yet We Were Soldiers manages to separate itself from the pack and give us a unique take on one particular battle in one particular war. Depicted here is the first major battle involving American troops in the Vietnam War. The fact that this battle takes place in what is known as the Valley of Death tells you all you need to know about what awaits the men who head into combat.The central figure in the movie is Lt. Col Hal Moore, played by Mel Gibson. Moore, leading the 7th Cavalry, will train his men and lead them into whatever hell awaits them. The film begins back home as Moore assembles his new unit and begins to whip them into shape. Here we learn much about what makes Hal Moore tick and begin to see him for the true leader of men he is. These opening scenes are important as they show many of Moore's motivations and also the obstacles which are placed in his way. The time back home also allows us to see Moore the family man with his strong, stoic wife, played by Madeline Stowe, and their young children. We also meet other key characters. There is Moore's second-in-command, battle-tested Sgt. Maj. Plumley, played with wonderful gruffness and all the appropriate seriousness by Sam Elliott. There is helicopter pilot Bruce Crandall, played by Greg Kinnear, and young Lt. Jack Geoghegan, played, surprisingly well for someone who came to prominence in a silly farce like American Pie, by Chris Klein. But the key figure throughout is undeniably Moore and Gibson's strong, confident portrayal is a key to the movie's success.While important in establishing the key characters and the emotional ties that bind them to each other and those whom they are leaving behind, the opening scenes back home have a feeling of just biding time about them. The film really takes off when the 7th Cavalry is dropped into the Valley of Death and confronts the overwhelming enemy force which awaits them. The rest of the film deals with this one epic, unrelenting battle. It sounds clichéd but the battle scenes are so well choreographed and photographed that you do truly feel as if you are there. The intensity of the conflict jumps off the screen. The focus is on the valor and heroism of the American soldiers but unlike so many war films which present a nameless, faceless enemy we also get to see things from the Vietnamese perspective. We see the enemy leaders detailing their strategy and also are presented with reminders that the Americans are not the only ones with loving, concerned families back home. We see the toll on both sides, not just for the soldiers but perhaps most poignantly in scenes inter-cut from home where soldiers' wives wait to learn the fates of the men they love.We Were Soldiers is a brutally honest, unflinching look at the hell that is war. It is a story which begged to be told. Seeing as it is adapted from a book by two of the central figures in the conflict, Hal Moore and reporter Joe Galloway who found himself thrust into the middle of the conflict (and who is played wonderfully by Barry Pepper in the film) you can rest assured that unlike so many other war films this one would focus on 'getting it right.' The film tells it as it truly was. It is at times invigorating and inspiring and at other times truly heartbreaking. All in all it is a fitting tribute to, as the film states at the beginning, the men on both sides who died in that place.",8,12,19,29 August 2005
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Sometimes it's hard to see what others see
","Usually if you find that you don't like a film which has been deemed a classic you can at least see what it may be that leads people to think so highly of the film. That is not the case with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. I don't get it. I'm not seeing what so many others apparently are seeing. I see an incredibly overrated film that is not even remotely worthy of the near mythical status it has attained. Whatever it is that supposedly makes this film a classic is well and truly lost on me.The biggest problem with the film is that nobody involved apparently could decide what kind of film it was they were making. Was it a serious Western or a comedy Western? The film ends up stuck in some sort of netherworld in between. It's much too jokey to take very seriously but not nearly funny enough to be labeled a comedy. The film tries to be multiple things and ends up not being much of anything at all. It's a film that never really convinces, things always seem a bit off. Just the very concept that the 'good guys', the guys we're meant to sympathize with and root for, are actually the bad guys was always going to be a little jarring. Hooray for the train robbers! It could have worked but it really doesn't. No fault of the actors as Paul Newman and Robert Redford, Newman especially, make the characters of Butch and Sundance respectively easy to like. And Sundance's girl, played by Katharine Ross, certainly has her charms as well. But even if you end up liking these characters it's still hard to like the movie.You would think it would be hard to make a boring movie based on the exploits of notorious bank and train robbers. But that's pretty much what we have here. This film moves at a snail's pace, moments of excitement are few and far between. The interminable chase sequence dropped into the middle of the film surely doesn't help. If I had to watch Butch peer into the distance and say 'Who are those guys?' one more time I'd scream. Get on with it already. Honestly for much of its running time this movie has you desperately trying to stifle yawns. And when the movie tries to have a little fun it generally doesn't work. So many jokes which fall flat. And that famous, yet exceedingly dopey, bicycle sequence. Hard to take the movie seriously after that. Good song though. I just have no idea what in the world it's doing in this movie. One thing you can say for the movie is that it is beautifully photographed. Cinematographer Conrad Hall's Oscar was well earned. And Newman and Redford, both of course terrific actors, do have very good chemistry and Ross fits in well also. The interactions among the three lead performers provide some good moments. But there are not nearly enough of those moments to salvage the film. It's dull and drawn out, it's neither serious enough to work as a real Western or funny enough to get by on comedic value. The film just doesn't work. But it's a 'classic'. I don't get it.",5,45,65,24 August 2010
Crash," A brilliant ensemble cast in a brilliant film
","A riveting and explosive drama, Crash is a simply terrific film. Exploring issues of race in a brilliant manner the film manages to be thought-provoking and eye-opening and yet still entertaining and thoroughly engrossing. Crash follows a widely disparate cast of characters in Los Angeles where people's prejudices and assumptions color the way they see others and ultimately impact their own destiny. We follow over a dozen central characters and explore the ways in which the fates of these people, seemingly with no connection to one another, all become intertwined. It's a tangled web and a fascinating one to explore.If one actor had to be singled out as the star of the picture it would be Don Cheadle as a black cop being pulled in many different directions. His family, his superiors and his Latina female partner, who he also happens to be sleeping with, all want something different from him and the plot can be said to revolve around him. Cheadle gives a terrific performance but there are many other actors doing excellent work portraying varied characters, each of whom have their own unique and well-developed story. Particularly noteworthy are Matt Dillon as a racist cop, Terrence Howard as a successful black television director, Michael Pena as a Hispanic locksmith who is also a loving father and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges as a young man who has chosen a rather interesting career path. In somewhat lesser roles the likes of Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Esposito, Thandie Newton, Ryan Philippe and Larenz Tate all do fine work. There are other less-familiar faces who also turn in very good performances. Perhaps the only casting misstep is Brendan Fraser as the Los Angeles district attorney. Fraser really isn't plausible in the role, not having the appropriate sense of seriousness and experience required. But his screen time is mercifully short, not nearly enough to detract from all the terrific performances around him.Cross-cutting between characters, following so many different stories that all tie in to one another somehow, Crash is a thrilling ride. It is full of suspense, has many, many moments of great drama and sheer terror, and all along is filled with raw, genuine, honest, in-your-face emotion. It is certainly a movie with a message yet you do not feel as if you are being preached to. The story is simply laid out there for you to see for yourself the consequences which prejudices and false assumptions can have. It is a brilliantly conceived story which is performed wonderfully by a superb cast. One cannot ask for much more than that.",9,1,6,7 October 2005
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," It's the end of the world as we know it. And it's hilarious.
","At the height of the Cold War the fear of nuclear obliteration was quite real. If the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a nuclear war there would be no winners. Stanley Kubrick made a film about this impending doomsday. This was obviously a very serious issue so the film would have to be dark, dignified and grave. Or maybe it wouldn't. Instead it would be one of the most hilarious black comedies the world had ever seen. What to do when faced with the end of the world? Laugh.As the American president would later tell the Soviet premier an American base commander 'went and did a silly thing.' This quite insane commander ordered his planes to attack the Soviet Union. When these planes drop their nuclear bombs the Soviet doomsday device will be activated and that for all intents and purposes will be the end of the world. Well that doesn't sound very funny. Oh, but it is. Kubrick played this dire situation for laughs and, helped to no small end by his amazing cast, created a comedic masterpiece.Everywhere you look in this film you see great actors turning in legendary performances. By virtue of the fact he played three different roles Peter Sellers gets most of the acclaim. And he is magnificent in all his various guises. He's the president, a British officer and Dr. Strangelove himself, a mad German scientist who has a hand with a mind of its own. Sellers was actually supposed to play a fourth role as well but that part, bomber commander Major Kong, eventually went to Slim Pickens. And while Sellers probably would have been fine in the part Pickens is simply perfect. A true-life American cowboy, patriot and total yahoo. Playing the truly insane base commander who starts the clock ticking to disaster is Sterling Hayden. It is a quite unique madness which afflicts this character and Hayden performs the role beautifully. Sellers, Pickens and Hayden are all fantastic. And there is a terrific supporting cast which notably features a young James Earl Jones. With all these great performances it would be near impossible for one man to steal the show. But George C. Scott comes really close to doing just that. He plays General Buck Turgidson who is ostensibly working to recall the American bombers but who quite clearly actually relishes the idea of mushroom clouds over Moscow. Scott's manic, over-the-top performance is comedic gold. His facial contortions alone are enough to induce side-splitting laughter. Scott may well be the best thing this film has to offer. And in a film this good that's really saying something. It's a film with a great story, great humor, great performances. Just for good measure Kubrick also tosses in one of the great movie sets of all time. How magnificent is that War Room? Do remember though that you can't fight in there.",8,1,4,16 November 2012
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A fine end to a thrilling trilogy
","Though not quite up to the standards of A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi is a satisfying end for the Star Wars saga. This one doesn't seem to have quite the same pace as the first two. It kind of meanders about with little bursts of energy here and there before it comes to its thrilling grand finale.When last we left our heroes and villains Darth Vader had just told Luke Skywalker he was his father and Han Solo had been frozen in carbonite to be taken away by bounty hunter Boba Fett to Jabba the Hutt. Here, Luke will deal with Han first, Vader later. We begin on Luke's old home planet of Tatooine where we learn Han is being held, still frozen, as a captive of the giant slug-like creature Jabba. Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO will all be involved in a mission to free Han. Suffice to say things don't go quite according to plan and among other indignities Leia ends up wearing a skimpy bikini and chained to the monstrous Jabba as his slave girl. Soon Luke arrives and we see his powers with the Force have grown but not to the extent that he can avoid finding himself in quite a predicament himself. We end up spending quite a bit of time on Tatooine, perhaps a bit too much as the film struggles to really get going. Finally (and inevitably as otherwise we'd have a really short movie) our heroes manage to free themselves from Jabba's clutches and we can move on to what will be the central theme of the movie. Luke Skywalker's attempt to redeem his father, Anakin Skywalker, and turn him from the evil he has become, Darth Vader, back to the good man he once was will be the main focus from here on in.Before he can confront Vader, Luke returns to Dagobah to finish his Jedi training with master Yoda. Here he learns his training is in fact complete. All that stands in the way of his being a Jedi Knight is to confront (and presumably defeat) Vader. After the stunning revelation in the last film in which we learned Vader was Luke's father another branch of the Skywalker family tree is revealed here. Not quite as stunning but something that certainly will change the perspective of some of the key characters when they learn the truth and also change how the audience perceives them.Travelling with Han, Leia and a rebel party to the forest moon of Endor, Luke will be part of a mission designed to bring about the destruction of a new Death Star the Empire is constructing. Those on the moon will be responsible for bringing the battle station's shield down so the rebel fleet can attack and destroy the Death Star. If the mission fails it will be the end of the rebellion and there will be no hope of freedom in the galaxy.Unfortunately as we move towards the film's climax we get bogged down on Endor as our heroes encounter a band of Ewoks, tiny primitive bear-like creatures. While they certainly may appeal to kids (and therefore sell a bunch of toys) the Ewoks have no place in this story. They do not bring the requisite level of seriousness required considering all the serious things which are occurring around them. There it seems only for comic relief the Ewoks are in fact not funny. Instead they are incredibly annoying and the film slows to a crawl as we learn more than we could ever want to know about them and their way of life.Eventually, sensing his father's presence, Luke leaves the rest of the rebels (and their new furry friends) to confront Darth Vader and try to turn him away from the Dark Side of the Force. Vader may seem to waver a bit but he is convinced it is too late for him. Vader will bring his son before the Emperor, briefly glimpsed in the last film and now played wonderfully by Ian McDiarmid. The Emperor, determined to turn Luke to the Dark Side, is pure evil personified. Soon, Luke will be faced with a choice. He must turn to the Dark Side or be destroyed.Meanwhile, back on the moon of Endor, Han, Leia and company are running into their own problems. If they don't get the Death Star's shield down the rebel fleet will face certain annihilation. It all builds to a thrilling conclusion as we cut back and forth from the efforts of the rebels and Ewoks on Endor to the confrontation between Luke, Vader and the Emperor on the Death Star to the rebel fleet's attack on the battle station. The ending certainly does not disappoint. It is dramatic, emotional and ultimately thrilling. The Star Wars saga ends with a bang.Return of the Jedi does have its problems, most notably a slow pace and the presence of the insufferable Ewoks. The performances of the actors aren't quite up to their prior standards. Harrison Ford at times seems to be going through the motions as Han Solo although that may have something to do with the fact he's acting with a bunch of little furballs. Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia seems strangely emotionless, especially when faced with some rather startling news. Mark Hamill does do well to capture the earnestness of a son who never stops believing there is good in his father despite all evidence to the contrary. McDiarmid is terrific and even in voice only James Earl Jones gives a terrific performance as Darth Vader. Of course, the visuals and special effects are typically dazzling. After the majesty of the first two films, Return of the Jedi may be seen as a slight disappointment. But all in all it is a worthy conclusion for a grand, sweeping, epic saga unlike any other we have ever seen.",9,0,0,27 May 2005
Alien," A sci-fi horror 'classic' which disappoints
","Upon its initial release critical reaction to Alien was mixed to negative. One notable review described it as an empty bag of tricks. One critic dismissed it as an overblown B-movie. Another called it deeply dislikeable. Then a funny thing happened. Audiences saw the film and liked it. The film became a big success. It wasn't long before the film was being touted as a classic of its genre. Critics who had initially panned the film went back and wrote entirely new reviews praising it. The film was now beyond criticism. Nobody would dare admit they did not love it. Truth is the critics had it right the first time. This film is just not very good.Alien is meant to be a scary monster movie but the scares certainly don't come fast and furious. This film takes a long, long time setting itself up. Director Ridley Scott tries to build suspense. But this slow build drags on far too long for the film's good. Tension and intrigue drain away, boredom sets in. The film is often described as 'Jaws in space' in that it's a monster movie in which we see very little of the monster. But where Steven Spielberg kept Jaws crackling along Scott's film gets terribly bogged down. Jaws also benefited from compelling characters. No such luck with Alien. Sigourney Weaver has some presence to her playing the key role of Ripley. But that character doesn't really spark to life until very late in the film. The rest of the cast has very little to do. A boring group of characters prone to doing stupid things. Like searching for a cat instead of, you know, escaping the giant murderous Alien. There are some notably fine actors here, including John Hurt and Ian Holm. But the script fails them. The characters never inspire much feeling in you at all, giving you little reason to care about their fate. There is very little story here, no character development whatsoever. A late reveal of one character's background proves more silly than shocking. The film has a memorable moment or two. But one or two moments in a two-hour film aren't nearly enough. This monster movie is monstrously overrated.",5,4,10,6 April 2013
Horrible Bosses," A comedy that's far from horrible
","Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell play three horrible bosses. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis play their respective mistreated employees. One night over drinks these employees get the bright idea to kill their bosses. Well, it seemed like a bright idea anyway. Their plans inevitably go awry, these are not guys well-equipped to plot murders. The laughs come fast and furious as their plot unravels. Who knew attempted murder could be so hilarious? The movie sets up a reasonably interesting story and then the excellent cast takes that story and runs with it. It is the performances that really make Horrible Bosses work. Each of the six key figures fits into their role wonderfully. Spacey is a treat in playing a sadistic executive at a financial firm. Aniston is both funny and sexy in playing a man-eating dentist. And Farrell effortlessly disappears into the body of a clueless, cocaine-binging schlub. But while the bosses are great it's their murderous employees who really carry the movie, we spend much more time with them. Bateman, as he does so often, largely plays the straight man which suits him perfectly as he reacts to all the chaos swirling around him. Sudeikis is terrifically witty, delivering deadpan humor in a way that always brings a smile to your face. And Day may be the best of all. Perhaps the least known of all the film's stars he threatens to steal the whole show. There's something endearingly offbeat about his character and Day captures that so well. The chemistry between Day, Sudeikis and Bateman is terrific. You really pull for these guys, and laugh with them, even as they plot a triple homicide. The fact they bumble things all the way through obviously helps with the laughs.While not a perfect comedy Horrible Bosses ultimately is a very satisfying one. Perhaps we could have spent a little more time with the bosses, there was probably some comedic potential there left untapped. Farrell in particular gets short shrift, he is definitely underused. And if you have Kevin Spacey playing a deranged psychopath there's so much more you can do with him than this movie does. But all in all the movie works. What the performers are given to do they all do very well. Day may be the standout, and Aniston memorably blows her good girl image to smithereens in hilarious fashion, but all six of the film's stars deserve a lot of credit. It's a winning ensemble enhanced by one supporting character, the 'murder consultant' our bumbling idiots hire. That character adds a few more laughs to the movie's impressive comic mix. This is a comedy with great energy, great laughs, great characters and just enough story to keep the whole thing moving forward. The bosses may be horrible but the movie about them is pretty great.",7,0,1,5 December 2014
The Doors," An ordinary film with one extraordinary performance
","Watching Oliver Stone's The Doors can be at times a frustrating experience. Considering the central figure in the film is pretty much always drunk or stoned or both the entire plot seems to unfold in a bit of a haze. Those watching the film may come away feeling a little stoned themselves. Yet through the drug and alcohol-fueled haze this film does have a lot to recommend it. Most notably it has one of the most stunningly brilliant acting performances you could ever hope to see. Val Kilmer, playing Jim Morrison, is simply perfect in the role. It sounds clichéd but Kilmer really seems to become Morrison. The physical resemblance is eerie and their voices are so similar it is fairly impossible when listening to the film's soundtrack to figure out when exactly you're hearing Morrison and when you're hearing Kilmer. Tracing Morrison's journey from shy, reserved youth to manic, drugged-out rock god the performance by Kilmer is mesmerizing throughout.As good as Kilmer is you can't help but feel that his performance deserved to be surrounded by a better film. The film might as well have been titled 'Morrison' because it is much more the story of one man than it is the story of his band. And therein lies much of the problem because while Kilmer is undeniably terrific, Morrison, at least as he is portrayed in this film, is not a very sympathetic character. That shy, quiet guy we see on the beach at the film's beginning becomes a bit of a monster, at times almost completely unlikable. And since the film revolves entirely around Morrison it makes the film often hard to embrace. Many would argue that Morrison was unfairly portrayed here, not nearly as mean-spirited and hot-tempered as we are led to believe. The truth probably lies somewhere in between but the fact remains that in this film it is very hard to embrace Jim Morrison and as such it is very hard to completely embrace the film.With the focus almost completely on Kilmer's Morrison the rest of the cast comes off as little more than bit players. Kyle MacLachlan as keyboardist Ray Manzarek has the most to do amongst the remaining band members and his performance is fine but it really gets swallowed up by the ever-present and always center stage Morrison. Meg Ryan, playing Morrison's longtime companion Pamela Courson, is allowed only to react to Morrison's antics and never establishes a character and identity of her own. Even when stoned out of her mind, as everybody in this film always seems to be, Pamela comes across as the wholesome girl next door who is, well, rather dull. Kathleen Quinlan has a more memorable turn as another woman in Morrison's life, Patricia Kennealy, who is anything but dull. But again her character is there only to serve Jim. It's always about Jim. Nobody could deny that Jim Morrison was the most captivating figure in The Doors. But as the film unfolds and you watch Morrison stumble from one stupor to the next you'll probably wish we could have spent a little more time with some of the other characters. This film version of Jim Morrison is a hard guy to love.So in the end what are we left with? You get one awe-inspiring, magnificent performance but that performance overshadows everything else going on in the film. You get a fascinating life story but one that unfortunately proceeds mostly in a frustrating drug-induced haze. You certainly get a tremendous soundtrack with all of The Doors' most notable songs. Well, most of them anyway. There seems to be a real yin and yang with this movie. There is plenty that is very good about it, but all that is good seems to be balanced out by something which frustrates. Jim Morrison led an extraordinary life but this film which tells his tale ends up being rather ordinary.",6,78,110,30 May 2006
The Town," Ben's 2 for 2
","Ben Affleck follows up his excellent directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone, with another winner in The Town. It's perhaps not quite up to the standards of his first film but it is very good in its own right. Affleck goes back to the world he knows best, Boston. In this case specifically the neighborhood of Charlestown, perhaps the nation's most notable armed robbery hot spot. Robbing banks, holding up armored trucks, it's a way of life for the residents of Charlestown. Well not all of them of course. But enough of them to make the area's reputation well-earned. From this neighborhood comes the group of four thieves our story will follow, the crime lord who holds the crew under his thumb and the strung-out girl clinging to the dream of a romance that has long since passed her by. It turns out there's one other important character who calls Charlestown home. Claire is the manager of the bank our crew robs in the film's opening. She ends up being taken hostage but is released unharmed. When the thieves find out she's from the neighborhood what are they to do about her? The hothead of the group would have no qualms about putting a bullet in her head. The more reasoned leader of the group decides to track her, find out what she knows, see if she can implicate them. He ends up doing more than tracking her, he falls in love with her. This, needless to say, provides complications.Affleck himself plays the lead role of Doug, the bank robber looking for a way out who may have found it in this new romance which blooms with Claire. But getting out is never easy. Not when hot-tempered Jem finds out Doug's fooling around with the girl who could put them all away for life. And not when crime lord Fergie always has another job for the crew. And not when Doug's old flame Krista, who happens to be Jem's sister, refuses to let go. It's a very tangled web, one which seems to have Doug well and truly trapped. Charlestown keeps a strong hold on those who call it home.Affleck does a reasonably fine job with his portrayal of this somewhat tortured character. There is the nagging sense that his time in front of the camera here may have detracted a bit from his work as the director. This movie is not nearly as focused as Gone Baby Gone, a little sloppy at times. Character development is rushed or in some cases nonexistent. Jem, played with a wonderful spark and clear menace by Jeremy Renner, is the only character other than Doug who we really feel we get to know much at all. Crime lord Fergie, played by a scarily gaunt Pete Postlethwaite, obviously holds a powerful sway over Doug and his crew but we never know why. It's left rather unexplained how such a sickly old man could hold young, powerful toughs so firmly under his thumb. Old girlfriend Krista, played by a seemingly miscast Blake Lively, is woefully underdeveloped. All we know about her is that she's a train wreck and that she longs for Doug. And Lively is a little too glamorous to do train wreck very well. Jon Hamm plays the lead FBI agent who is no different from any other FBI agent you've seen in a movie like this. And even Claire, the new love of Doug's life and the woman who is really the key to the whole story, is pretty much a blank slate. Doug obviously forms an emotional connection with her. We in the audience never do.So there are some things you wish The Town did better. But there are many things which it does very, very well. It opens with a Dark Knight-esque bang with a thrilling opening heist scene. The other robberies later on in the film are well done too, Affleck proving he can be an action director. While we may struggle to identify with some of the other characters Doug's plight is very easy to relate to and with his portrayal Affleck creates a very sympathetic character out of a guy who is involved in some rather nasty business. Well done that is. There is the sense that the movie drags some between the big action sequences. The romance between Doug and Claire, and the conflict it causes between Doug and Jem, isn't always enough to sustain the film's energy as it moves forward. Affleck and Renner work together very well, and there's really nothing wrong with Rebecca Hall's performance as Claire either, but the story never fully engages the way you'd hope it would. And with so much of the focus on these three characters everyone else gets the short shrift. And that comes back to bite Affleck in the end when train wreck Krista is put in position to make a decision that sets the whole final act in motion. We haven't spent enough time with Krista for it to ring true that the whole movie suddenly gets tossed in her lap. It all can be a little frustrating at times. You know this movie could've been better. Maybe by starring as well as directing Affleck stretched himself a little thin. But even accounting for the flaws it does have The Town is still an entertaining, well-made film. Could've been better but still manages to be pretty good when all is said and done.",7,0,0,18 January 2012
Closer," Four people and the tangled web they weave
","In a single moment the lives of four strangers who have no connection to one another will be changed forever. A man and a woman meet in unusual circumstances and their lives will never be the same. What's more a woman whom neither of them will meet until a year later and a man who won't enter the picture until a further year later also will have their fates decided in this single moment. One day you're minding your own business and your life's path is determined because a young American woman you don't even know looks the wrong way when crossing a London street and is hit by a taxi. Funny how life works sometimes.Alice, a 20-year old stripper who has just arrived in London, is the young woman who has the unfortunate meeting with the taxicab. She's not seriously hurt. Flesh wound really. But this moment changes everything. As she lies in the street she is attended to by Dan, a man she had spotted across the street and sort of flirted with in the moments before she stepped into the taxi's path. Inevitably they fall in love. But it will not necessarily be happily ever after. A year later we find that Dan, who writes newspaper obituaries, has written a novel based on Alice's life. As he is being photographed for publicity for the book he flirts with the American photographer, Anna, shares a kiss with her and ends up trying to talk her into having an affair. Alice discovers this and tells Anna, but not Dan, that she knows. And having asked Anna to take her portrait Alice has the moment that her heart breaks forever committed to film. Another year goes by, a year in which Dan stalks Anna without success. One night Dan enters a cybersex chat room where, while pretending to be Anna, he meets dermatologist Larry. Dan sets up a meeting between Larry and 'Anna' but when Larry in fact does meet up with the real Anna a funny thing happens. Larry and Anna fall in love.So now we've met our four players and the fun can begin. By fun I mean lying, cheating, backstabbing and generally reprehensible behavior. The four are all brought together when that photo Anna took of a tearful Alice is displayed in her photo exhibition. Dan and Alice are still a couple but Dan uses the occasion of the exhibition to pick up his pursuit of Anna and this time she relents. They carry on an affair for a year, even as Anna marries Larry in the meantime. Eventually Anna and Dan admit their indiscretions to their respective partners and leave those relationships for one another. But there are still plenty more twists and turns to come in this tale. Through it all the story is engaging. It's a smart, serious, adult drama which captivates throughout.Much of the film's success can be attributed to the winning performances of the four lead performers who for all intents and purposes are really the only performers in the film. Julia Roberts, as Anna, probably has the least showy and thus least memorable of the four roles but her performance is certainly fine. The other three stars really shine. Natalie Portman as Alice, Jude Law as Dan and Clive Owen as Larry are all on top of their games. Each of the three have some truly powerful moments and they do so well in bringing some rather complex and conflicted characters to life. There's a lot of emotion in this story, sometimes bubbling under the surface and sometimes on full, raw display. And all four of the stars convey that emotion wonderfully. The characters they play may at times be hard for the viewer to embrace. These are people capable of some truly dastardly deeds so this certainly isn't an uplifting, feel-good kind of movie. It's a movie which if nothing else is honest, sometimes brutally so. You may not love these characters but you can't help but appreciate their story.",7,0,0,14 December 2009
Shutter Island," Sometimes a big twist isn't enough
","We have seen before that a big twist at the end can make an otherwise ordinary film into something much greater. Think The Sixth Sense. But we have also seen that relying on a final big twist to save your movie can be a dicey proposition. Because if your big twist doesn't have as powerful an impact as you would hope your movie falls flat. Think M. Night Shyamalan films other than The Sixth Sense. Sadly Shutter Island falls into that trap. The ending doesn't satisfy and certainly doesn't redeem all that came before it. Because so much of what came before is rather mundane. But you hold out hope because you know the story is building towards some kind of big revelation. It has to, this is a movie which screams 'Twist!' from its very beginning. This was never a story which was going to play out in a straightforward, conventional manner. So for whatever disappointment you may feel as the movie progresses the hope is still there that there will be a big ending to save the day. But alas that is not to be the case. The movie fizzles out. The ending, really the whole movie, turns out to be a dud.Now of course Martin Scorsese is not a man prone to churning out duds. So how did this all go so wrong? Maybe it's a case of a story trying to be too smart for its own good. It's a puzzle in which not all of the pieces end up fitting together properly. We start with an interesting setup. Two U.S. Marshals are sent to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a patient from a hospital for the criminally insane. The fact that this hospital is located on an island essentially cut off from the world ratchets up the intrigue and suspense. But right from the start you get the sense this movie's messing with your head. Something's not right. Somebody's hiding something. Somehow everything seems just a bit off. Is it the location? The characters? Whatever it is there's a great sense of mystery, the possibility of great discovery. But the movie never pays off that initial promise. Eventually you get the sense you are destined to be let down. And in the end you are.Leonardo DiCaprio does the best he can with the lead role of Marshal Teddy Daniels. Whatever failings the film has can't be laid at DiCaprio's feet. He is utterly convincing. But the story is not. There are plenty of fine performers to support DiCaprio. Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow and Michelle Williams all play their parts well and there is room for some fine work from other actors in smaller roles. But ultimately the fine cast is let down by the story. The story is the big problem. There are other problems too. The overbearing musical score comes to mind. But it is undoubtedly the story which dooms the movie. When the final piece falls into place you look back and realize the story's not nearly as smart as it needed to be. The end result is an utterly ordinary movie. It's one of those movies which demands a second viewing to really see how all the pieces come together. But it's not an interesting enough movie to make you care enough to go back and watch it again. Once is enough. A second viewing isn't likely to enhance your appreciation any. You can look back, put it all together in your mind, and realize it just doesn't work. Scorsese has made such a brilliant career for himself with tough, gritty, urban dramas. With Shutter Island he wanders a bit outside of his comfort zone. He's done so before to sometimes good effect. But this time he couldn't make it work.",5,2,4,13 July 2010
Lost in Translation," Beautifully unique
","It's the story of a man. A famous actor, middle-aged, not particularly happy in his marriage. And it's the story of a woman. Much younger, a recent college graduate, also not particularly happy in her marriage. These two Americans meet by chance in a Tokyo hotel. In most movies this is where a cheap, meaningless fling would ensue. But Sofia Coppola's script is much too smart for that. And so Lost in Translation is something entirely different. Something unexpected, a beautiful surprise. It's the story of two lonely people, two lost souls. And in finding one another perhaps they can find themselves.In playing this couple brought together by fate Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are superb. Murray plays Bob Harris, a hugely successful actor who is in Japan to make commercials for whiskey. He hates himself for it, he'd rather be home doing theater. But the money's good. And home's not all it's cracked up to be anyway. His marriage has grown stale. Bob's a guy in the throes of a midlife crisis. And Murray captures the character perfectly. The sense of loneliness, the sense of disappointment in life and in himself, it's all etched on Murray's face. So famous for loud and outrageous comedy here Murray does so much with simple subtlety. Meanwhile Johansson plays Charlotte, a young woman tagging along with her celebrity photographer husband on his trip to Japan. Even when her husband is around Charlotte feels lost and alone. When he's off working and she's left to fend for herself all the pain and doubt she is feeling threatens to consume her. She needs something to cling to and that something turns out to be Bob Harris. And as this couple embarks on an undeniably interesting and rather unusual relationship the young Johansson proves to be up to the task of matching the veteran actor Murray. The two stars turn in hugely memorable performances which really elevate the film.But as wonderful as Murray and Johansson are perhaps the true star of the film is Sofia Coppola. She wrote a wonderful script. And then she directed it so beautifully. She has a truly terrific visual sense, making the city of Tokyo almost a character unto itself with the way she captures it on camera. As Bob and Charlotte explore the city everything is framed so beautifully. And when the movie briefly veers away from all the excitement of the big city for a few moments in a much quieter, peaceful locale Coppola succeeds in making that perhaps the film's most beautiful scene of all. She has made a movie which definitely succeeds in drawing you in and making you care about its characters. It's not the most exciting thing you've ever seen. It's much more subtle than that, a movie which trusts itself enough to unfold at its own leisurely pace. And in this case that works. It's a great story of two people who initially are lost but end up finding something. What they find may not be exactly what they were looking for but this is a movie too smart for the simple answer, the easy way out. And that more than anything else is what makes this movie a success.",7,2,4,27 July 2010
We Are Marshall," Not quite as uplifting and inspiring as it could have been
","Here we have yet another entry in the 'inspiring sports movie' genre. You know the type...Rocky and Rudy and Hoosiers and so on. The plucky, overmatched underdogs whose story of course leads to that big uplifting moment at the end which will make you cheer or cry or both. But We Are Marshall is a little bit different than those other films. Here the story is not just about overachieving, not just about competing with and maybe even beating an opponent who is simply much better than you. This is a story about overcoming so much more, about facing unspeakable tragedy and finding the strength and will to carry on. Why is it then that when this film's inevitable 'big moment' comes you may well sense that you found yourself more inspired by, say, the rather mundane by comparison story of Rudy with some not particularly talented kid getting to play for a few seconds in a football game? We Are Marshall, with the story it has to tell, should clearly be the most uplifting and inspiring film of this particular genre. But it's not. It's a good movie, a very good one at times. But it never quite lives up to the potential you sense the story had.The film begins in November 1970 with the Marshall University football team flying home from a game. However the team will never make it home as their chartered plane crashes just short of the airport in Huntington, West Virginia. In an instant the entire Marshall football program has essentially been wiped out. But of course in the immediate aftermath of the crash nobody is really concerned with football. The entire Huntington/Marshall community is in mourning. So many lives lost and not just the team either, as many of Huntington's most prominent citizens, Marshall supporters all, were on the plane as well. The fact that a number of children were left orphaned, losing both parents in the crash, speaks to the depth of the tragedy. In the face of a tragedy like this how could football really be important? In fact the first inclination of Marshall administrators is to discontinue the football program. But the following season the Marshall University football team would in fact take the field. This movie tells the story of how new coach Jack Lengyel essentially rebuilt the program from scratch, got a team out on the field and helped to, at least in some small way, allow this shattered community to heal.It's obviously a very captivating story. So why does the movie not quite hit the heights you sense it should? The biggest problem is the movie's pace. Fifteen to twenty minutes easily could have been cut here to help the movie move along. As it is the movie struggles to build the momentum so important in leading to that big payoff at the end. Some characters seem superfluous, most notably that of the girlfriend of one of the dead players, as portrayed by Kate Mara. There's nothing wrong with Mara's performance, it's just that her character seems totally unnecessary and really adds nothing to the film. Any time spent with her character is time which could have been better spent elsewhere or better yet cut out of the film altogether. In the central role of the new coach Matthew McConaughey gives what is at times a frustrating performance. All the offbeat quirks and mannerisms wear thin after a while. Perhaps he was trying too hard to imitate the real Coach Lengyel, but whatever McConaughey was trying to do he never quite manages to convince. And since his character is at the very heart of the story that is a rather glaring problem with the movie. But despite the problems the movie may have it's still well worth seeing. You'll be both inspired and entertained. You just may get the sense you should have been a little bit more inspired and entertained than you actually are.",7,0,1,2 April 2008
Interstellar," More admired than enjoyed
","There is much to admire about Interstellar. It is a film with a thoroughly compelling, thought-provoking story. The visuals are spectacular, the effects are brilliantly done. The performances are all quite good. There are moments of great drama, moments of almost unbearable tension. And there are moments which are genuinely awe-inspiring. This is a film which can fill you with wonder. So why, after seeing the film, do I feel a little bit let down? I am left with the nagging sense that for all the film has going for it Interstellar just is not entertaining enough. And films are first and foremost meant to entertain. This is a noble effort from director Christopher Nolan. He crafted a film which is in many ways quite special. But while you admire what Nolan accomplished is this a film you want to come back to? Do you want to see it again and again? Probably not. It lacks that little spark of entertainment that any film needs to be truly spectacular, to make you want to come back for more.Interstellar unfolds in a future where failing crops have led to starvation. There is not enough food to go around. Earth is failing. Widowed former astronaut Cooper, inquisitive young daughter Murph in tow, stumbles upon a top-secret NASA installation which is conveniently located near his home. There he meets Professor Brand, an old mentor of his who is working to save humanity. Not working to save Earth, working to get humankind off Earth. Lots of talk of wormholes and faraway galaxies where man can start again. Brand needs someone to pilot a spaceship to go check out some of these faraway worlds. No prizes for guessing who is soon strapped in for a rocket ride to outer space.So Cooper takes off on this mission, which comes with the complication that these faraway worlds are really, really far away. Murph is less than pleased that her father is leaving. He promises he'll be back. Of course he does. But of course complications ensue. This mission is a race against time and it is a race Cooper and his crew are losing badly. The fate of humankind hangs in the balance. Heavy stuff. But Cooper just wants to get home to his young daughter. Unfortunately there's the problem of time dilation. There are instances where time on Earth is moving much faster than it does on Cooper's ship and Murph is all grown up and Earth has completely gone to hell and yes this is all a bit confusing. The science in the film is very well worked out but the focus needs to be more on the human drama than the science. There certainly will be plenty of human drama as the story twists and turns through its final act.This gripping story is performed very well. Matthew McConaughey fits the role of Cooper perfectly. A man determined to save mankind but pained by guilt over what he has left behind. McConaughey portrays the inner turmoil in excellent fashion. Michael Caine provides appropriate gravitas as Professor Brand. Anne Hathaway comes off a little cold in playing Brand's daughter, a biotechnologist who travels with Cooper on the epic journey. But that coldness is really part of the character, no fault of Hathaway. And maybe it's not coldness? Maybe it's a steely determination to see the mission through? Anyway, Hathaway and McConaughey play off one another well. Jessica Chastain doesn't show up until well into the film but when she arrives she makes a great impact. The rest of the cast does solid, and in some cases, quite surprising work. So if this fascinating story is performed so wonderfully why does the film not work quite as well as it should? The film's story certainly draws you in but there is that sense that the story could have been told in more entertaining fashion. There are times where the story drags. There is an abundance of clunky dialogue. While the science of the film is well thought out there are times the film seems to get lost in the science. Especially near the end there are moments that are just a little too confusing. So wrapped up in the science of what was possible Nolan seems to have lost a bit of his grip on the human story at the heart of the film. Where the film should be rushing to a brilliant climax it gets bogged down in details. Momentum fades away. Interstellar leaves you with a great appreciation for what Nolan attempted. This is bold, brave filmmaking. Unfortunately as entertainment it falls just a touch short. There is so much to admire about the film. It is certainly well worth seeing once. But, even with all the questions it raises, it is not a film you may be eager to revisit.",6,1,3,26 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Flawed but worthy addition to the saga
","We pick up ten years after the events of Phantom Menace. The former Queen of Naboo, Padme Amidala, is now a Senator and returning to Coruscant for a crucial vote on the creation of an army for the Republic, now threatened by Separatist factions. Amidala is a leader of the opposition of the Military Creation Act. Upon reaching Coruscant an attempt is made on her life and off we go.Old friends Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker are assigned to protect the senator. Ewan McGregor returns as Obi-Wan and gives another fine performance. Hayden Christensen takes over the role of the adolescent Skywalker, who is now being trained as a Jedi by Obi-Wan. Anakin is excited to see Padme after all these years and his childhood crush has blossomed into full-blown love. Here Christensen's performance suffers as he and Padme, played once again by Natalie Portman, embark on one of the most awkward romances I've ever seen.After another attempt on Padme's life and a frenetic chase through the skies of Coruscant Obi-Wan and Anakin corral the bounty hunter responsible. But before she can reveal who she was hired by she is killed by a toxic dart. And this will send Obi-Wan and Anakin off in different directions.Obi-Wan finds the dart came from a planet called Kamino, a planet of cloners located in a system which does not appear in the Jedi archives. With some help from Yoda and some young Jedi in training Obi-Wan is able to ascertain the location of his missing planet. It seems information about Kamino had been deleted from the archives. Only a Jedi could have done this. Who and why? These are answers which will prove critical.Obi-Wan makes his way to rain-soaked Kamino where he is told that years ago a since-slain Jedi placed an order for a clone army. The template for the clones was bounty hunter Jango Fett who Obi-Wan meets on Kamino. We also meet Jango's son Boba, a key figure of the original trilogy who it is quite interesting to see the origins of here. Obi-Wan comes to believe Jango was responsible for the attacks on Senator Amidala. The Jedi Council, disturbed they could not see creation of the unauthorized clone army orders Obi-Wan to bring Jango to Coruscant. Easier said than done as Obi-Wan must track Jango and his son Boba to the planet Geonosis.Meanwhile in the interests of safety Anakin has escorted Padme back to her home planet of Naboo. Here he makes his feelings for her quite clear. She resists as they would have to live a lie which would destroy them both. She clearly has feelings for him but attachment is forbidden for a Jedi. To carry on this romance could lead to Anakin's expulsion from the Jedi order. The dialogue here as the two grow closer is stilted, wooden and forced. People just don't talk like that and it detracts from the film. It is hard to blame the actors who can only read the lines they are given.We soon see that Anakin is burdened by terrible nightmares about his mother who he feels is suffering on Tatooine. Here we first see great pain and fear in young Skywalker. And as Yoda taught us in Episode I fear is a path to the Dark Side. Anakin and Padme race to Tatooine to rescue his mother, now the wife of moisture farmer Cliegg Lars who lives in a familiar homestead in the desert. Here we first meet a young Owen Lars and his girlfriend Beru who will later have a much larger role to play. It turns out Anakin's mother has been kidnapped and is feared dead. Anakin goes off to attempt to rescue her and when he sees how she has suffered we see the first glimpses of anger and rage in the young man who would be Darth Vader.Leaving Tatooine, Anakin, Padme and loyal droids R2-D2 and C-3PO (happy to again see Anakin, his maker) take off for Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan who has fallen into the clutches of Count Dooku, a former Jedi who left the order and is now leader of the Separatist movement. Dooku has a massive droid army at his disposal and it seems the Jedi will be needing that clone army after all. Anakin and Padme are soon captured and along with Obi-Wan sentenced to die. With death imminent Padme drops the facade and tells Anakin she loves him. Their lives are about to be destroyed anyway so he should know.Of course we know the execution won't quite go as planned. Much of the drama here is drained by the fact we know quite well certain characters must survive or else there can't be an Episode IV and, well, we've already seen Episode IV. However what follows is visually impressive as a great number of Jedi, reinforced by their clone army, arrive on Geonosis. For the first time in the saga we see many Jedi in action as the droid and clone armies face off. The lengthy but well-done battle sequence is the beginning of the Clone Wars.After a final surprising and ultimately thrilling lightsaber battle we begin to tie up the loose ends and get ready for Episode III. Episode II turns out to be satisfying although it certainly has its flaws, most notably the cringe-inducing attempts at romance coming from the mouth of young Anakin. But the positives far outweigh the negatives. Jar Jar Binks is mercifully reduced to a minor role. Samuel L. Jackson is given much more to do this time around as Mace Windu. Ian McDiarmid is reliably terrific in his performance as Chancellor Palpatine. The visuals are stunning, the battle sequences thrilling, all backed by another terrific score by John Williams. It's not perfect but Attack of the Clones does its job in making you anxious for Episode III, the final piece in the puzzle.",9,4,8,20 May 2005
Forrest Gump," An amazing life. An amazing movie.
","Few, if any, characters in movie history have had an amazing a life as Forrest Gump. He's such a simple man. Stupid? Stupid is as stupid does. Forrest may be a little slow. But he gets life, he knows what's important. He remains true to himself, to his values. He is fiercely loyal to those he loves. And as Forrest himself says, though he is not a smart man he knows what love is. Just by doing what he knows in his heart to be right this simple man has the most incredible life. His journey is magical, inspiring, heartwarming. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's poignant, it's mesmerizing. Forrest Gump touches the lives of so many people around him. And along the way he changes the course of world events too. This is a life which has to be seen to be believed.So how does an Alabama boy with an IQ of 75 end up changing the world? Just by being himself. Life happens all around him and Forrest is often blissfully ignorant. He finds himself caught up in one extraordinary situation after another. In each situation, without fail, he just does the right thing, the good thing. He does what 'smarter' people, given the opportunity to think about the situation, might not. He thinks not of the consequences, he just follows his heart. And that heart takes him to the most amazing places. He is a man driven by love. Love for his friends, for his mama, and above all for his beloved Jenny.The story of Forrest and Jenny is inspiring and tragic, heartwarming and heartbreaking all at the same time. From their first meeting as children the bond between these two is unbreakable. No matter how they may drift apart that connection is always there. And drift apart they do for while Forrest has his amazing life's journey Jenny has a journey all her own. She embraces life in her own way. In confronting her demons she makes some bad choices. No matter how far gone she may seem to be she knows, and we know, that Forrest will always be there for her. Forrest doesn't judge her as so many others would. He just loves her, always and forever, no matter how hard she makes it to love her at times. It really is one of the great relationships in movie history.The relationship between Forrest and Jenny is the real heart of the story but there's so much more. With everything Forrest experienced it's remarkable that director Robert Zemeckis managed to cram it all into less than two and a half hours of film. And give credit to Zemeckis too for creating the right tone for the film. In the wrong hands this could have been an overly sentimental mess of a film. But in Forrest Gump Zemeckis presents a film, and a character, which is good but not too good to be true. So many outrageous things happen to Forrest Gump but you believe in this story every step of the way. Zemeckis put all the pieces together perfectly. Everything fits, right down to the wonderful soundtrack with the perfect songs for each of the big moments in Forrest's decades-long journey. A great share of the credit for the film's success of course goes to Tom Hanks who played Forrest to perfection. An obviously challenging character to play. How far do you go in portraying Forrest's innate simplicity? Hanks got it just right. The rest of the cast is terrific as well. Robin Wright hits all the right emotional notes in playing the deeply troubled Jenny. Sally Field is everything you would want your mama to be. Mykelti Williamson brings great personality to the role of Forrest's wartime buddy Bubba. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna Hall are wonderfully endearing as the young Forrest and Jenny. And Gary Sinise is utterly brilliant in playing Lieutenant Dan, a character whose story arc is as dramatic and compelling as can be. Hanks of course won an Oscar for his performance, which was pretty much a given as soon as the film was released. That Sinise didn't pick up an Oscar as well for his supporting role seems borderline criminal. What a performance he gave in a supremely challenging role.Much was made upon the film's initial release about the effects used to insert Forrest Gump into history. The effects may seem quaint by now but they were truly revolutionary at the time. And they add a nice touch to the movie. It's cute seeing Forrest tell JFK he has to go pee or to see him chatting with John Lennon. All of Forrest's brushes with history give the movie a grander scale. They show the impact this very simple man had on the world. But for all the famous people he met, for all the wondrous things he did, Forrest would be the first to tell you that everything he ever needed was right there at home in Greenbow, Alabama. His friends, his mama, his Jenny. That's all Forrest Gump ever needed. And look at the impact he had on those closest to him, often without even trying. Look at where Lieutenant Dan is in life by the end of the film. Forrest got him there just by being himself, by doing what was right. And Forrest was of course always there for Jenny too. Such a simple man yet he touched so many lives. Not a smart man? Listen to what Forrest has to say about destiny in the incredibly poignant scene near the film's end. Maybe Forrest Gump had us all fooled. He may have been the smartest one of all.",9,1,1,10 December 2011
Gone Baby Gone," Who knew Ben had it in him?
","Director Ben Affleck presents a gripping film about the aftermath of a child abduction.Wait a minute. Director Ben Affleck? Yes indeed. The often maligned actor and gossip column fixture serves up a serious-minded, thought-provoking near-masterpiece in his feature directorial debut. Sometimes brilliance comes where you least expect it. Now whatever you do Ben please don't waste your newfound credibility by starring in another Gigli.Gone Baby Gone unfolds in Boston, which is of course the perfect setting for an Affleck-helmed film. Ben certainly knows the city and more importantly knows its people. And this knowledge is so important as the movie unfolds. Everything seems so believable. Everyone fits perfectly into the Bostonian tableau. What at first may seem a rather simple story will eventually reveal itself to be quite complex. And a group of fine actors, all wonderfully cast, brings that story to wonderfully vibrant life.In the key role Affleck chose to cast his younger brother Casey. Does that send up a red flag? It shouldn't, the younger Affleck does a tremendous job. He plays Patrick Kenzie, a private investigator who works with his partner (and lover) Angie Gennaro, who is played by Michelle Monaghan. Patrick and Angie's work usually involves tracking down deadbeats. But when a young girl in their neighborhood goes missing they are asked by the girl's aunt to investigate. And from here the story takes myriad twists and turns. Only bit by bit is the full picture revealed to the audience and in the end you may find that the story simply takes your breath away.Casey Affleck is at the heart of the film but it is the wonderful supporting cast which really takes the film to another level. Monaghan is fine in her role, although you may feel you don't get to know her character as well as perhaps you should. Amy Ryan is a true standout as Helene, the mother of the missing girl. Helene seems much more interested in drugs than her daughter and Ryan is spot-on in portraying this character who at times is sympathetic and at other times reprehensible. Ed Harris is reliably brilliant as Remy Bressant, the lead police investigator into the abduction. Remy is a man of obvious passion and strong conviction. It is an interesting dynamic to say the least to see him working with the young Patrick and Angie of whom he has obvious doubts about their ability to be of any help. Morgan Freeman, John Ashton, Amy Madigan...just a few more familiar faces turning in excellent work. And there are so many lesser-known performers, including some ordinary Bostonians from the neighborhood, who fit in perfectly. All the pieces fall into place and the end result is something special to see.Gone Baby Gone is not a perfect film but any criticisms amount to just minor quibbles. A couple of characters, most notably Monaghan's Angie, could be fleshed out a little better. The story's turns may make it seem a little hard to follow at times but that's OK because it will encourage you to want to go back and watch the film again to see the clues and unravel the secrets. And this is a film well worth seeing a few times. It's a film which raises some serious moral questions and dares you to decide what you would do in such situations. You'll be thinking about this one for quite a while afterwards. Director Ben Affleck? Believe it. It's hard to see how anyone could have done this story any better.",8,0,1,4 February 2009
The Godfather: Part II," An epic tale. Two epic tales in fact.
","Remember that young idealist Michael Corleone from the opening wedding scene in The Godfather? That Michael Corleone doesn't exist anymore. His descent began in the original film as he took over the family business. In Part II the now ruthlessly evil Michael bottoms out. He has money, he has power. But at what cost? It is hard to comprehend what he has become, so sad to see him cost himself everything he really holds dear. And, in a stroke of genius, as we watch Michael fall director Francis Ford Coppola at the same time flashes back and allows us to see Michael's father rise. The rise of Vito Corleone, the fall of Michael. Either story on its own would be epic. Interwoven together the two stories combine to make The Godfather: Part II one of the most audacious and most brilliant films ever made.After a brief introduction to the Vito storyline Part II thrusts us right back into that familiar Godfather world which we left at the end of the first film. It is now 1958 and Michael has moved family operations to Nevada. We open at the family compound in Lake Tahoe with an elaborate party celebrating Michael's son's First Communion. Yes, the parallels with the first film's wedding scene are obvious. Rather than Vito it is now Michael who everyone waits to see. Even his sister Connie will have to get in line and wait her turn for an audience with Michael. The real business of the day, involving a proposed Corleone takeover of another casino to add to their empire, is conducted between Michael and Nevada Senator Pat Geary. We see that Michael is so powerful, and so sure of himself, that he thinks nothing of being totally dismissive and insulting towards a United States Senator. Safe to say this is not the most cordial of business meetings. Nothing seems to be decided and Geary, a true sleaze in his own right, leaves but you know we'll see him again. Michael moves on to his next meeting with Frank Pentangeli, who is now running the old Corleone New York territory. This meeting is bitter and hostile as can be. It's been a long day for Michael Corleone. And it's about to get much, much worse. An attempt is made on Michael's life. Bullets come flying into his bedroom. He and his family emerge unscathed and you know the film is now going to kick into high gear. This is going to get really, really good. And then the film immediately transports you back to 1917 and the story of Vito Corleone.So is Coppola pulling the rug out from under you by leaving Michael's story just when you can't wait to see what happens next? Not at all. Vito's story will prove to be just as compelling as Michael's. And throughout the film Coppola chooses the absolutely perfect times to jump from one story to the other, at emotional high points, places where the connections between the two stories are the most poignant. It's brave, brilliant film making. The audience is treated to two fabulous stories which fit together absolutely perfectly. As the film plays out we see Vito begin to acquire power and Michael consumed by power. We see the great love Vito has for his family as we watch Michael's family fall apart around him. We know Vito is capable of some evil things but he still has some heart to him. Michael has clearly lost his heart somewhere along the way. Just telling Michael's story would have been enough to make this a great film. Weaving young Vito's story in so seamlessly is what makes the film something truly special.As with the first film Coppola is helped here by universally brilliant performances from his cast. And as with the first film it is Al Pacino who makes the biggest impression. His performance as Michael is as powerful and captivating as anything you've ever seen. Michael is such a complex character and his journey from the beginning of the first film to the end of this one is something that has to be seen to be believed. And over both films Pacino is spot-on perfect every step of the way. In the parallel story it is Robert De Niro who gets the critical role of young Vito and he does ever so well in giving life to the man who would one day be Brando. We of course have the familiar faces from the first film. Robert Duvall as lawyer Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's long-suffering wife Kay. There's Talia Shire and Morgana King. And most memorably of all John Cazale as hapless, hopeless Fredo. Part II also gives us great new characters, making room for new performers to make their mark on The Godfather saga. Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo, G. D. Spradlin, Gastone Moschin, Dominic Chianese...the list could go on and on. Such a huge cast and yet every performer seems to fit their role perfectly. The film tells two great stories and the acting is absolutely wonderful throughout. Some two hour movies seem to drag endlessly. This nearly three and a half hour movie absolutely flies by. A monumental achievement for Coppola, one of the best films of all time.",9,1,3,23 January 2011
The Aviator," A fascinating movie about a fascinating man
","The story of Howard Hughes' life is an amazing one. Where would one even begin trying to tell this tale? Martin Scorsese smartly focuses on Hughes as a young man. It was a time in which Hughes had the world at his fingertips only to let it all slip away in a terrible descent into madness. In The Aviator we see Hughes at his most triumphant but we also see him lose it all as his mind betrays him. Capturing all of this in a terrific performance is Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is brilliant in portraying the young swashbuckling pilot, mogul and ladies' man Hughes was. He also manages to convince in showing Hughes as the beaten shell of a man he would become. It's almost as if DiCaprio had to portray two entirely different characters and he does a magnificent job of it.While this is clearly DiCaprio's (and by extension Hughes') movie, there are fine performances by a host of other stars portraying many of the key figures in Hughes' life. Most notable is Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, the true love of Hughes' life. It has been said that Hepburn herself was a bit of a caricature, certainly not someone who would be easy to portray, but Blanchett does it brilliantly. She captures the mannerisms, voice, style and heart of Hepburn. It would have been easy to hold something back in this performance for fear of coming off, well, a bit odd. But perhaps Hepburn really was a bit odd and Blanchett really went for it and nailed it. In a bit part as Jean Harlow, Gwen Stefani is really not required to do much more than look pretty, a task she is certainly capable of. While by no means bad, Kate Beckinsale's turn as Ava Gardner is nowhere near as good as Blanchett's. We never really get to know her and the movie suffers for that. And while Beckinsale certainly looks glamorous enough, it seems she is just imitating Ava Gardner whereas by contrast Blanchett truly is Katharine Hepburn.On the male side of the ledger John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda all do fine work. Reilly plays Noah Deitrich, Hughes' right-hand man who must concern himself with the money because Hughes can't be bothered with such things. His ideas are much too big to be limited by money. Baldwin plays Juan Trippe, who runs Pan Am and in doing so finds his company's position threatened by Hughes' TWA. What's a businessman to do when threatened? Why, take advantage of his relationship with a corrupt politician of course. Alda fills that role and the back and forth between Alda's slimy senator and a defiant DiCaprio is among the film's highlights. As usual, Scorsese has gotten the best out of his cast.Capturing the essence of a man whose life had so many tremendous peaks and valleys is quite difficult. Add in a potentially crippling mental illness and the challenge gets ratcheted up another notch. Very few directors could have pulled this off but Scorsese succeeds. We go along for a fascinating ride, reveling in Hughes' triumphs and agonizing right along with him in his darkest hours. It is a triumph for Scorsese but perhaps even more so for DiCaprio who brilliantly captures both the genius and the madness of Howard Hughes. Perhaps the film could have been a little more concise but with everything Hughes did in his life it's easy to imagine the film could have actually ended up being much longer. It would be impossible to tell the whole story of Howard Hughes. The story Scorsese and DiCaprio give us is a fascinating and eminently worthwhile one.",8,1,3,11 July 2005
American Pie," A mostly satisfying slice of pie
","OK, so it's not The Godfather or Gone With The Wind. It is what it is, and what it is isn't that bad at all. American Pie is a silly farce and if you're willing to turn off your brain for a couple of hours and just go with it you may well find it rather enjoyable. If you're looking for a 'serious' movie with some deeper meaning, well then you've obviously come to the wrong place.The story, such at it is, revolves around a group of male high school seniors desperate to lose their virginity before graduation. But the story's not really the point, it seems as if the story's just there as something to fill space between gags and jokes. And there are plenty of gags and jokes, many tasteless, mostly funny. But even as we race from one joke to the next there is time to get to know a widely disparate cast of characters. Jason Biggs plays the central character of Jim, a mostly hapless type who finds himself on the wrong end of most of the jokes and gags. There's Chris Klein as the athlete, Eddie Kaye Thomas as the eccentric and Thomas Ian Nicholas as the seemingly normal one of the group. Outside the main circle of friends is the outlandish Stifler, played with perverse glee by Seann William Scott. Of course there are also the girls our boys are chasing. Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Natasha Lyonne wander through but the two standouts are Shannon Elizabeth as foreign exchange student Nadia and Alyson Hannigan as geeky Michelle, two characters who will have a few surprises for the boys chasing after them. Also of note is Eugene Levy as Jim's dad. It's the only real adult role of any significance in the film and Levy brings his typical comic genius touch to the part.Anyone can do a teenage raunchfest but American Pie is something more. It's a raunchfest with heart if that's at all possible. We get to know and sympathize with these characters and watch them evolve over time. But we also get quite a few laughs at their expense along the way. Certainly American Pie will not go down in the annals of history as an all-time classic. But it's a funny, enjoyable, satisfying experience.",7,0,1,1 September 2005
Burn After Reading," Be more funny
","Burn After Reading is a movie which starts with great promise, thanks mostly to John Malkovich who plays newly fired CIA analyst Osbourne Cox. Initially it seems this is the character who will be the focus of the movie. If only. All too quickly the movie veers away from Osbourne and that's a shame because Malkovich is easily the best thing this movie has going for it. Once the focus shifts to other characters the movie begins to fizzle out. Osbourne pops up now and again and whenever he does Malkovich injects some life back into the movie. But those moments are all too fleeting. As the story plays out you want to give the movie the benefit of the doubt. It started so well. And it is after all a Coen brothers movie. These guys obviously know what they're doing right? But as the movie slogs along you eventually come to the point where you realize it's just not going to happen. This movie is never going to come together properly. In a nutshell it turns out to be a black comedy without any comedy. And who wants to see something like that? Yes, even the best filmmakers miss the mark sometimes. This is no Fargo or Lebowski. This is in the end a real disappointment.This is a movie about some incredibly stupid people. You would think that would at least provide the opportunity to laugh at all the stupidity on display. But these people are too pathetic to laugh at. What we see here is more sad than funny. Brad Pitt plays gym employee Chad Feldheimer and this character is indescribably stupid. Mere words can not possibly express how dumb this fellow is. And Pitt really seems to be overacting, trying so hard to make something out of this dim bulb. But the effort fails. The character is a joke but not a funny one. What an incredibly annoying character Chad turns out to be. And fellow gym employee Linda Litzke, played by Frances McDormand, isn't much better. At least McDormand is more subtle than Pitt in expressing her character's stupidity. That's something I guess. Completing the circle of stupidity is George Clooney playing U.S. Marshal Harry Pfarrer. On the surface it may seem that Harry's smarter than the other dopes. He's not. Anyhow these idiots find themselves caught up in something way beyond the capacity of their feeble little brains and that should lead to some good laughs. But it never does. The only good moments come when Osbourne Cox pops up as Malkovich is always good for some memorable volcanic eruptions. But mostly we're just dragging our way towards a finish which leaves some characters looking back and wondering what exactly was the point of all this. That's a very good question. The whole thing was rather pointless. And rather unfunny. All in all it's a very disappointing effort from a directing tandem we've come to expect such great things from.",5,1,2,8 July 2010
Watchmen," Yes, you should watch the Watchmen
","Watchmen is certainly not your typical comic book movie. The first hint of this is that nobody calls the original source material a comic book. It's a graphic novel thank you very much. This implies a certain weight, gravity and seriousness. And it also indicates the reverence fans had for the material. Long deemed unfilmable Watchmen would require not just a very talented director but a brave one. Zack Snyder was up to the task. The film he produced was not perfect. But with all the inherent challenges it was probably as close to perfect as one could reasonably hope. Snyder made a very entertaining, compelling and ultimately quite satisfying film.Watchmen is not an adaptation of the original printed story. It is that story brought to life lock, stock and barrel. To get the project off the ground it was deemed that adherence to the original story was paramount. And with amazing attention to detail Snyder fills the screen with every bit of that story. This makes for a very dense film. To say there is a lot going on is an understatement. It also of course makes for a very long film, clocking in either side of three hours depending on which version you're watching. But the story holds your interest throughout, with the smart cultural references sprinkled in adding more layers. There is enough big action to carry things through some of the inevitable lulls that come in a film of this length. The film looks spectacular, terrific sets and costumes make the film really pop off the screen. The myriad visual effects are very well done. The music fits in perfectly. And Snyder coaxed winning performances from his cast.There are a couple of standouts in the ensemble cast. Jackie Earle Haley does a fabulous job as Rorschach. No easy task bringing personality to a character completely hidden away behind a mask, Haley does so superbly. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is excellent as well portraying the Comedian, showing a somewhat less heroic side to the hero. All the other performers fill their roles capably if not spectacularly. The women, Malin Akerman and Carla Gugino, aren't given much to work with and it's hard to get a handle on Billy Crudup's performance at all what with our seeing a CG representation of him rather than the actor himself. But while some may be less memorable than others all the characters work, all the actors did enough to do the story justice. And what a story it is. It's a long journey in this most sprawling of comic book movies. The long trip is well worth it as the film shows why legions of fans consider Watchmen to be no mere comic book.",7,0,2,19 December 2013
The Thing," Some things work, some things don't
","The Thing is a monster movie with a twist. The monster could be the guy standing next to you. Or maybe the monster could even be you. The story unfolds at an American research outpost in Antarctica. Some crazy Norwegians show up, shooting at a dog. Before the Americans can ascertain what is going on the Norwegians are dead. Soon everyone will realize this dog is no dog at all. It's, for lack of a better term, a thing. This thing can take the appearance of other creatures it absorbs. It can become a perfect imitation of any living creature. So now how much do you trust that guy standing next to you? Paranoia overwhelms the group very quickly. This thing is, quite literally it appears, eating the group alive.Kurt Russell plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot who becomes the leader of the group as they try to stop the thing before it destroys them all. If they don't stop this thing in its tracks and it manages to make its way to civilized areas it will be the end of humankind. So some pressure on our little group then. MacReady is a take-charge kind of guy. But who's to say he's not a thing now? Certainly other members of the group have their doubts. Trust is a commodity in very short supply. Where the film fails a bit is in failing to really establish any characters beyond MacReady. A couple of them stand out because they're portrayed by actors we recognize, Wilford Brimley for example. But it's a largely faceless bunch, not a whole lot of personality in the group. And for a bunch of supposed scientists they're not the smartest group either.The movie has some decent twists and turns, leaving you guessing along with the characters as they try to determine who's still human. It's an intriguing story but it certainly would have grabbed you more if you really identified with all of the characters. As it is there are too many guys whom you really wouldn't care about should the thing make a meal of them. Characters, and the story as a whole really, too often take a backseat to the gore which director John Carpenter piles on liberally. If you're looking for a gross-out movie you'll find few better. The creature effects are very well done but maybe a little too repulsive for some people's tastes. A little more story, a little less blood and guts, probably would have served the film well. It is a very compelling story. You just wish the filmmakers trusted that story enough to allow it to carry the film. The paranoia, the mistrust, there's so much great tension there potentially. But tension loses out in the quest for gory, scary moments. In a movie such as this you want to have some good frights. But you want the scares to enhance the story, not overwhelm it. The balance in this movie is just a little bit off. It's an interesting movie but there is definitely the sense more could have been done with such a fascinating concept.",6,13,22,5 June 2014
21," Entertaining but don't think too much
","21 is a movie for which your level of enjoyment will probably depend on how much you actually think about the plot. In this case the less thinking you do the better. Thinking will make you realize very quickly that the film's central characters, reputed geniuses all, do a lot of very stupid things. So don't think about it. Just enjoy the movie for what it is. It's not a particularly smart movie but it is entertaining and sometimes that's enough.The movie is based on the true-life exploits of the MIT blackjack team. The movie veers quite a distance away from the actual true story but the basic premise remains the same. The two key characters here are Professor Micky Rosa, played by Kevin Spacey, who runs the team and new recruit Ben, played by Jim Sturgess, who joins the team to earn the money he needs for Harvard Med School. As soon as he has enough cash for his tuition Ben is out. At least that's the plan. But we know better than that. Once Ben gets sucked into the Vegas life he's not leaving. Unfortunately, and inevitably, things go awry. So then we get some twists and turns and drama as Ben tries to rescue the situation.As the movie plays out our team of math geniuses are basically begging to get caught. But if they're not going to face any potential consequences there's really no conflict, no drama, and ultimately no movie. So there's quite a bit of stupidity from the blackjack team. And that stupidity is not limited to their time spent in Vegas. So Ben, when you return to MIT with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash where are you going to keep all that money? Oh dear, this will end badly. OK, some of the plot contrivances are a little hard to accept. But accept them you must for the movie to move forward. There's enough good here to make you look past the movie's flaws. Sturgess does well with the key role of Ben, creating a compelling and sympathetic character. Spacey is reliably excellent as always. Unfortunately nobody else in the cast adds much. As the required eye candy a film of this type demands Kate Bosworth's character of Jill disappoints. There's no spark, no personality there. When we first see her the MIT geeks build her up to be some sort of goddess but when we actually get to know her it's a letdown. None of the other blackjack team members make much of an impression at all. And in playing an old-school casino enforcer type Laurence Fishburne is little more than a cliché. But despite all that's wrong with it the movie still somehow succeeds. It's well-paced enough to hold your attention throughout. At times, especially in the end, things get a little convoluted but the story works. More or less. As a whole the movie is not quite winner winner chicken dinner but good enough.",7,0,0,31 July 2010
Little Miss Sunshine," Relentlessly charming, thoroughly enjoyable
","Of all the terrible ideas in the history of humankind the idea of beauty pageants for seven year old girls must be among the worst. Seeing little girls all tarted up to look like mini-whores is beyond unsettling, it's downright repulsive. Happily, Little Miss Sunshine, the film, takes the time to point out the stupidity and awfulness of Little Miss Sunshine, the pageant within the film. More happily, the film is really not about the pageant but rather about one little girl's journey as she and her rather odd family travel to the pageant. And what a charming, hilarious and ultimately uplifting journey it is.The movie centers around young Olive, a refreshingly normal girl compared to the rest of the 'beauty queens' on the pageants for third graders circuit. She gets the opportunity to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, which as you can see by her reaction when she finds out she gets to go, is apparently a really big deal. And here the hilarity begins as her family piles into their old VW bus for the journey from their home in New Mexico to the pageant in Redondo Beach, California. Suffice to say the trip does not go exactly according to plan. And with the motley crew that makes up this family there is no shortage of laughs. But in addition to all the laughs the film has so much charm and heart. It's a movie which certainly has its dark moments but in the end it's absolutely a feel-good story.Now, about that family. Olive is the key, and in playing the role Abigail Breslin is simply amazing. You need not qualify it by saying it's a great performance for a child performer. It's a great performance, period. Breslin wonderfully captures all of Olive's varied emotions, and there are many on this journey. Whatever it is she has to get across at a given moment, Breslin does it. Saying she is amazing really doesn't do her justice, she's absolutely perfect. Hard to be better than perfect. Everyone around Breslin does a great job as well, certainly no casting missteps here. There's Greg Kinnear as Olive's father, a self-help guru who could use a lot of help himself, both in jump-starting his moribund career and in holding his family together. Toni Collette plays Olive's mother, the most seemingly normal one of the bunch and apparently the glue that barely does hold the family together. Paul Dano plays Olive's rather unhappy teenage brother Dwayne, who has taken a vow of silence until he realizes his dream of becoming an Air Force pilot. The hurt Dwayne feels shines through. Kudos to Dano for being able to say a lot without saying anything at all. Steve Carell is remarkably understated and quite good playing Olive's Uncle Frank, a gay, suicidal Proust scholar whose life is in tatters as the journey begins. And finally, Alan Arkin plays Olive's foul-mouthed, heroin-snorting Grandpa. If not for Breslin's brilliance, one could say Arkin steals the movie. As it is he's just one noteworthy piece in this brilliantly conceived puzzle.Stick all these wonderfully varied characters in that beat-up VW bus for a couple of days and what you get is comic brilliance. You also get to see these incredibly different people come together to support one another through thick and thin. There's a lesson in this movie but Little Miss Sunshine doesn't beat you over the head with its lesson. It's much more subtle than that. After giving you plenty of laughs along the way it may only be when the film ends that you realize just how sweet and endearing the film was. This is one incredibly charming ride.",8,1,4,1 June 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Most pointless sequel ever?
","They just couldn't leave well enough alone could they? Most everyone enjoyed the first two Terminator films. And most everyone was probably satisfied with the way the story wrapped up at the end of T2. The Terminator story had been told. It was over. But Hollywood can never resist an easy money-grab so after 12 years of allowing the franchise to rest in peace we got T3. And the movie inevitably made obscene amounts of money so the accountants were happy. The fans? Not so happy. If you liked the first two movies the joke's on you. Not only is T3 a rather lousy movie but it also makes the first two movies, the ones people actually liked, completely irrelevant. All that stuff about stopping the machines, changing the future, determining your own fate? Forget all that. The future is inevitable. What's going to happen is going to happen. So none of this really matters. If that's the case why am I watching these movies in the first place? James Cameron had the good sense to stay away from this turkey. Linda Hamilton too. If only Arnold Schwarzenegger had resisted the lure of a giant paycheck we could have been spared the absurdity that is this movie. But alas Arnold went for the cash, Terminator legacy be damned. So we got this pointless, unnecessary, quite terrible sequel which cheapens the whole Terminator saga. Another Terminator gets sent back in time, John Connor starts running for his life, Arnold shows up to protect him and a bunch of things get blown up. The end. Story? What story? Who can be bothered with trifling things like a story when we can just blow out the budget on an interminable crane chase? The evil Terminator this time comes in the form of Kristanna Loken, a hot blond chick. This is likely in the hopes that the sight of a hot blond chick will distract teenage fanboys from the fact that the movie stinks. With Hamilton missing we need a new damsel in distress so we get a woefully out of her element Claire Danes. An action movie star she is most certainly not. John Connor is this time played by Nick Stahl, probably an improvement over T2's Edward Furlong. So at least there's one thing about this movie better than the last one. Not nearly enough to make up for the multitude of things which are much, much worse. Like Arnold's Terminator for example who just bounces from one pathetic attempt at an 'Hasta la vista, baby' style catchphrase to another. I think somewhere along the way somebody got confused and thought they were writing a comedy. A comedic Terminator, yes that's what the world wants. Have these people no sense at all? Did Arnold not read this script and realize he was destroying the memory of his most iconic character? Or did he realize it and just not care as long as the studio's check cleared? The film's final insult comes with the ending which is no ending at all. The filmmakers have no resolution to their story, just a setup for another movie to come. So they rendered the story of the first two films meaningless and couldn't even bother to have any story of their own. Gee, thanks. So glad I paid money to watch this utterly pointless movie. The future is inevitable and that future apparently includes lousy Terminator movies.",5,0,2,23 August 2011
Doctor Zhivago," A grand romance
","A love story set against a backdrop of incredible tumult and turmoil Doctor Zhivago is a rousing success. No simple romance, it is also an up close and personal account of the Russian Revolution and the devastation it would wreak on the Russian people. Easy to see why the film was banned for decades in the Soviet Union. It's quite a scathing indictment of the Bolsheviks and of Communist society. But it is the love story which truly endures. That is the reason the film is quite beloved by so many. It's a love story so grand you don't even mind that the lovers in question are a man cheating on his wife and a woman who slept with her mother's lover.Doctor Zhivago is one of those epics which director David Lean came to specialize in. It's movie-making on a grand scale. But for as big and huge and sweeping as the picture is there's that great, yet simple, love story at its heart. Fate brings Yuri Zhivago and Lara Antipova together. Fate also conspires to keep them apart. The trials and tribulations they go through could break anyone. But their love pulls them through. Even Yuri's wife Tonya, a sweet, loving, wonderful woman who has done nothing to deserve being cheated on would have to admit there is something special about Yuri and Lara. They are meant to be together, no matter how many obstacles the world throws up in their way.A movie which is 200 minutes long had better have some top-notch performers to carry it along and Doctor Zhivago certainly is not lacking in that department. In playing poet/doctor/lover Zhivago Omar Sharif goes through the film in rather bemused fashion. Bemused at times bordering on bewildered as Zhivago reacts to all that is swirling around him. But Sharif succeeds in conveying the good, gentle nature of his character. Not gentle at all is the vile Komarovsky, played with great relish and bombast by Rod Steiger. Tom Courtenay plays the committed revolutionary Pasha, a man who will have an interesting character arc to say the least. As Pasha changes so too does Courtenay, you can see his performance harden right before your eyes. Alec Guinness plays Yevgraf, Zhivago's half-brother. Guinness doesn't get much screen time, there more or less to serve as the narrator of the piece. But what he does get to do he does just as wonderfully as you would expect him to. And there are the two women in Zhivago's life. Geraldine Chaplin plays the wife, Tonya, in wonderfully endearing fashion. Chaplin proves to be so much more than a pretty face with a famous last name. But of course in this film she was always going to be overshadowed by Julie Christie playing Lara. Christie is utterly magnificent. Of course she looks the part, no great stretch to suggest any man would fall head over heels at the sight of Julie Christie. But Christie acts the part too. Tender moments with Zhivago, combative moments with Komarovsky, emotionally wrenching moments with Pasha, Lara really gets taken through the wringer. And Christie nails it every step of the way.It's not just the performers filling those six biggest roles who are excellent however. In a movie of this scope there is plenty of room for a large supporting cast and director Lean seemed to bring the best out of everyone. Nobody sticks out in any sort of negative fashion. It does help that there's a great story to work with. Two great stories really. The story of our lovers and the story of the world crumbling all around them. In a movie this long it's fairly inevitable that there will be some lulls and there are. But the movie definitely holds your interest throughout. It never, like some movies of its era, becomes too epic for its own good. Lean reins it in enough while maintaining enough of the grandeur which makes people love epic films in the first place. The film looks magnificent, photographed so beautifully. And everything is backed by a wonderful score featuring the famous Lara's Theme. Put it all together and you have a film which is quite enjoyable. It may not be right up at the top of a list of all-time great films. But it's on the list.",7,1,1,27 June 2012
American Beauty," Look closer indeed
","This film's tagline implores you to 'look closer'. And to truly appreciate the film you must do exactly that. Is anything really as it seems? Is anyone really who they outwardly appear to be? So many characters in the film, and really the story itself, have layers upon layers to them. As the story plays itself out we peel those layers away one by one and eventually we get to the truth and to the heart of who these characters really are. And we see that in many cases the signs were there all along if only we knew to look for them. Look closer.American Beauty centers around Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man with a job he hates, a wife who ignores him and a 16-year old daughter who thinks he is pretty much the biggest loser to ever walk the earth. Under these circumstances it is not particularly surprising that as we meet him Lester is about to go though a midlife crisis of staggering proportions. Part of the story's genius is that Lester, in his role as the film's narrator, immediately tells us how his story will end. Tucking this bit of information away in the back of your mind gives you an entirely different perspective as you watch the story play itself out. Throughout the story's many twists and turns you can't help but wonder how what you are seeing in any given moment will help lead to the conclusion you know is coming. And when that end comes, inevitable though it may be, it still manages to produce quite the shock in the manner in which it arrives. And then the film is over and you are left to piece it all together in your mind. It's a wonderfully crafted story and the fact that it was a first-time director in Sam Mendes who was able to piece it all together so well is rather astonishing.Kevin Spacey is undeniably brilliant in playing the part of Lester. He makes us feel Lester's frustrations, his longings, and allows us to really enjoy Lester's rare little moments of triumph. When first we see him Lester is so beaten down that it would take something truly amazing to jolt him back to life. Unfortunately for Lester that jolt comes in the rather inappropriate form of his daughter's friend who he lusts after and obsesses over from the moment he first lays eyes on her. Of course this 40-something year old man's obsession with a teenage girl is wildly inappropriate. But it's hard not to sympathize with Lester anyway as his newfound infatuation shakes him out of his rut and allows him to finally start living again.As Lester's story plays itself out Spacey is ably supported by a wonderful cast all around him. Annette Bening plays his rather cold, career-obsessed wife Carolyn. Carolyn is a woman not immune to the occasional moment of freaking out and at times there's the sense Bening is going a little bit over the top but she's mostly fine. It is three young performers who really shine. Thora Birch plays Lester's daughter Jane and imbues the character with the profound sense of disappointment she feels in her father and in the general state of her life. It's a very mature performance from a very young performer. As Angela, the object of Lester's misguided affections, Mena Suvari has a smaller part to play than Birch but she is very good as well. We know Lester's looking closely at Angela. You should too because there may be plenty hidden under the surface there. And Wes Bentley is a revelation in playing the Burnhams' young neighbor Ricky. After seeing him here one would have expected Bentley to go on to do many great things after this film. That hasn't quite panned out but in this film Bentley gives a wonderfully nuanced, emotional performance. There's one more important role and that belongs to Chris Cooper playing Ricky's father. Here again, look closer. This film is the story of Lester Burnham but there are so many other wonderfully developed characters as well. The film has a fascinating story to tell and that story is crafted rather ingeniously. It's a story you can't help but appreciate and one which you may be turning over in your mind long after the final credits roll. Look closer. And enjoy.",8,0,0,11 January 2010
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," It's quite the spectacle
","They couldn't kill his mom so now Skynet has sent a new Terminator back through time to kill John Connor, now ten years old. Well somewhere around ten years old anyway, the Terminator franchise has never been particularly good at establishing a timeline and sticking to it. Anyhow, as was the case the first time when Sarah Connor was the target, the new Terminator has not come back through time alone. The future human resistance has sent back someone to protect the Terminator's target. Of course the leader of that future resistance is John Connor. The Terminator's target is John Connor. So yes, John Connor has sent someone back though time to save John Connor. The first time around John sent a human back to save his mom and, no small detail this, ensure he would be conceived in the first place. Which makes very little sense if you think about it so I guess the best advice is don't think about it. Anyhow this time John doesn't send back a human to stop the Terminator. He sends back another Terminator. Oh, this is going to be good. Two Terminators from the future, a good one and a bad one, running amuck in Los Angeles. Lots of gunfights, lots of explosions, lots of beautiful mayhem.Arnold Schwarzenegger of course returns as the Terminator...with a twist. He's not the cold, ruthless killing machine of the first film. He's the good guy, John's protector. And he has more than met his match in the new and improved Terminator, the T-1000. If you thought the first film's Terminator was indestructible wait until you get a load of this thing. Shapeshifting liquid metal polyalloy, the T-1000 is an unstoppable villain. Robert Patrick, ordinary looking guy, plays the part of the T-1000 and manages to be more fearsome than big, bad Arnold ever was. But Arnold puts up a good fight. And, much more so than in the first film, Arnold actually gets to act. This time around his Terminator's got some heart to him. He's learning. He's almost...human.The conflict between the two Terminators is set up to be something spectacular and right from their first interaction the film doesn't disappoint. Schwarzenegger and Patrick both embody their killing machines wonderfully and, with the T-1000, the film's by now legendary visual effects add so much to the proceedings. Full marks to director James Cameron and his effects team for so brilliantly and seamlessly integrating their dazzling effects into the picture. They set the standard for generations to come.The film is not without its flaws. Edward Furlong never entirely convinces as young John Connor. Furlong gives a performance which gives off a spoiled brat vibe. Often it's very hard to see John Connor, as he is portrayed here, as a future leader of humankind. Furlong was new to the whole acting thing at the time and it shows. Throughout history we've seen plenty of mature film performances from child actors. This is not one of them. Linda Hamilton, again playing Sarah Connor, has a much harder edge to her than she did in the first film. Perhaps a little too hard of an edge at times one might feel but it's understandable for what the character has been through and for what she knows of the doomsday future. The two Terminators and John and Sarah are left to pretty much drive the plot forward by themselves, other characters serve as little more than window dressing. And at times the four main characters aren't enough to really keep the film moving along. Things sometimes get bogged down as we wait for the next inevitable confrontation between our two killing machines. Of course when those confrontations do come they are spectacular. Terminator 2 was in many ways a revolutionary film and, though not perfect, it is an enjoyable one. And for whatever quibbles you may have with the film there is no denying that it is a rather awesome spectacle.",7,0,0,5 May 2011
The Patriot," America's birth, bathed in blood
","There have not been many films about the American Revolutionary War. That is somewhat surprising as there are so many stories there to be told. The Patriot tells the story of one man, Benjamin Martin, who fights for his family. If at the end of the fighting independence has been achieved that is all well and good. But for Benjamin Martin family comes first. He is reluctant to fight, unwilling to place his family in danger. He won't go to the war. But the war comes to him. Right to his front porch. With horrifying consequences. And so Benjamin Martin takes up the fight. And what a bloody fight it will be. Nobody ever said the birth of a new nation would be pretty. There will be tragedy, heartbreak and grief along the way. Nothing worth fighting for comes easily.It is a blow to his family which drags Benjamin into the war. A blow which will be avenged quickly and savagely. The tone is quickly set for a film which will be bathed in blood. But there is more to Benjamin than brutal violence. He proves to be smart, cunning, an inspiring leader. Mel Gibson gives an excellent performance in the role, capturing all that makes up this very unique man. There is a quiet dignity and honor to Benjamin Martin and Gibson brings that out. But there is that brutal side to him as well and Gibson handles that with aplomb too. Speaking of brutal, there is the film's main antagonist, the unspeakably evil British Colonel Tavington. When first we meet him he commits an obscene atrocity. And it only gets worse from there. This is truly one of the most reprehensible film characters ever. Jason Isaacs relishes the role, embraces the evilness. It's a solid performance from Isaacs but the character really does go too far. He's too evil. He does things which simply are not believable. Yes there were surely atrocities committed in this war but this film takes the character past the point of no return. Bad things may have been done but not that bad. No wonder so many British critics were up in arms upon the film's release. It's good if a film has a villain you can truly despise but this villain is just too much. He leaves such a bad taste in your mouth that it detracts from the film.The over-the-top villainous Tavington is not the film's only flaw. There is a lot of dialogue that is clunky and awkward. The film clearly goes on too long, approaching three hours and at times really struggling to sustain itself for that length of time. But despite the flaws the film does enough good things to be deemed a success. Gibson is excellent, Isaacs a worthy foil. Other winning performances come from Heath Ledger as Benjamin's son, so eager to join the fight, and Chris Cooper as an American Colonel trying to hold his ragtag army together. If you want a bit of romance there's that too, Joely Richardson and her absurdly bountiful cleavage paired up with Gibson and bright, young Lisa Brenner for Ledger. And then there is the war itself, the brutal battles. The film spares nothing in its gory accounts of 18th century combat. The close-range gunfire, the bloody bayonets, and the cannonballs that do truly grotesque things to a human body. There are two good stories here, the big picture revolution and the more personal story of the Martin family. Those stories are meshed together very well by director Roland Emmerich. We haven't gotten many American Revolution stories in films. This one, flawed and highly fictionalized though it may be, is ultimately a satisfying one.",7,1,5,17 December 2012
Dark City," Finding our humanity
","Dark City begins with an opening voice-over narration which basically gives the whole plot away. Fans of the film hated this and in a later cut of the film the narration was removed. It does seem logical that a movie which has so many mysterious elements shouldn't reveal all its secrets in the first thirty seconds. But in this case the narration probably served the film well. Because what is going on in this film is very weird, exceedingly bizarre and not particularly easy to comprehend unless you have some solid base of initial knowledge to fall back on. And there are still enough twists, turns and impactful surprises to make the film very compelling. Giving the audience a little help at the beginning paid off. Otherwise by the time the film finally fully revealed itself many people may have been too lost, too confused, too frustrated to appreciate what they had seen. And there is so much to appreciate.It also must be said that having the story laid out in such detail early on allows the audience to accept that story much easier. It is a story which requires tremendous leaps of faith. Without sufficient grounding the story may ultimately have proved to be just too strange for many people to take. Even with so many of its secrets given away right at the start the story still manages to grab you. A man wakes up in a bathtub. He can't seem to remember anything. His forehead is bleeding. There's a dead woman on the floor. And then the phone rings, someone tells him he needs to run away now because they are coming to get him. Who are 'they'? Who knows? Anyway, the man flees and the movie kicks into high gear very quickly. The man is John Murdoch. Or is he? It becomes clear very quickly that nothing in this city is exactly what it seems. John Murdoch is not the only person here with vanished memories. He doesn't really know who he is. Nobody does. But nobody besides John realizes anything is amiss. It is up to him to unravel the mystery. What he discovers will shock both him and us. The film packs quite a dramatic punch and raises serious questions about humanity. What makes us human? This film's mysterious Strangers need to know the answer to that question.It is the Strangers who drive the plot. They can manipulate the physical environment of the city, creating new buildings and changing the form of existing ones in mere moments with just the power of their minds. And yet none of the humans ever notice anything has changed. And it is not just the buildings the Strangers change, they have a rather insidious, invasive way of changing the people themselves. Then the Strangers sit back and see what happens. The humans, unknowingly, are their lab rats. John however is resistant to the efforts of the Strangers. Not only that he apparently shares their powers. With the help of a police detective he sets out to find the truth and to give the citizens of the city back their humanity, give them back a sense of who they really are.Rufus Sewell does very well with the challenging role of John Murdoch, a man who does not know who he is. Sewell captures the original bewilderment well and then grows with the character as John finds the strength and determination to put an end to whatever is going on here. William Hurt plays the detective who ends up assisting John, Jennifer Connelly plays John's wife. They both end up very confused and Hurt and Connelly give very good performances as their characters try to figure out what the heck is going on here. Richard O'Brien is appropriately creepy playing the film's most prominent Stranger. Perhaps the only misstep comes from Kiefer Sutherland playing a doctor mixed up in the activities of the Strangers. Sutherland plays the role with a stammer which becomes distracting and annoying very quickly. It's a little bit of weirdness the film didn't need, it adds nothing to the character and the film's plenty weird enough already. But that quibble aside the film generally works very well. It is a fascinating, intriguing, thought-provoking story. Visually the film looks spectacular with wonderful set design and brilliantly executed effects. Perhaps the film goes a little overboard with the effects near the end. The story gets somewhat left behind as things wrap up with a big visual effects blowout. You can't help but think this very smart film deserved a little bit smarter of an ending. But the film ultimately is more than satisfying enough. It entertains you and it also makes you think which is always a good combination. Dark City's story is a very complex web to weave your way through, having had a little guidance at the start surely couldn't have hurt. And when you get to the end you'll look back and be grateful for the long, strange, fascinating trip the film took you on.",7,1,2,30 July 2013
Aliens," Another overrated 'classic'
","The first Alien film is considered a classic but I didn't particularly like it. This sequel is also considered a classic and I like this one even less than the first. At least the first one had a little tension. This one is just a shoot-em-up action thriller. See Aliens, shoot Aliens. Repeat as necessary. This makes for a thriller which is not particularly thrilling. Things get rather repetitive and monotonous. The film can't surprise us, we already know what the Alien is, what it's capable of. This time there are just more of them.The film picks up with our heroine Ellen Ripley awaking from a 57-year nap. While she was dozing a human colony has been established on the planet where she encountered the Alien all those years ago. In an amazingly convenient plot contrivance contact with that colony is lost soon after Ripley wakes up. Gee, what could have happened? A reluctant Ripley is sent back out into space with a team of Colonial Marines to investigate. These Marines are, by and large, idiots. They get to the colony. Surprise, nobody's there! Oh wait, they do find one survivor, a little girl who spends the rest of the movie screeching 'Ripley!' at the top of her lungs in exceedingly annoying fashion. Speaking of annoying the most idiotic of the idiotic Marines is Pvt. Hudson, played in excruciatingly terrible fashion by Bill Paxton. With this character we're talking Jar Jar Binks levels of annoying. Just shut up. Please. Every time this guy opens his mouth you dearly wish an Alien would turn up and devour him.In the first film Ripley was not the only character you cared about. There the rest of the crew, with one notable exception, were sympathetic figures as well. No such luck here. There's one guy, Corporal Hicks, who comes off reasonably well. The rest are a collection of morons, jerks and slimeballs. With an incredibly annoying child thrown in to boot. Sigourney Weaver does the best she can, turning in a solid performance as Ripley. But she gets precious little help. Michael Biehn is pretty good as Hicks and Lance Henriksen has some good moments as an android but everyone else is quite terrible. Paxton goes way beyond terrible, he is truly wretched. The story, such as it is, doesn't thrill you. The movie takes its sweet time getting to the Alien planet and once we get there it's just a shooting gallery. Aliens attack, they get shot. More Aliens attack, they get shot. More Aliens attack, they get shot. Eventually we come to the big finish. Here the movie does have some surprises for you if you haven't already lost interest. But ultimately this ending, like everything which precedes it, falls flat. The climactic battle is visually impressive but really quite silly. Honestly you can say that about the film as a whole. It looks good but the story is a dud. Genuine frightful moments are very few and far between. Suspense is sorely lacking. Characters say and do some of the stupidest things. And an Alien apparently knows how to work an elevator. Going up? No, this movie is going down, crash-landing with a thud.",4,7,17,8 October 2013
American History X," No, we can't all get along
","American History X tells the story of Derek Vinyard, a vile, racist, murderous neo-Nazi skinhead who decides he doesn't want to be that guy anymore. But he will find that once you are living that life it is not at all easy to get out. And much to Derek's chagrin he sees his brother Danny going down the same path which nearly destroyed him. Derek knows he has to reach Danny, change him, open his eyes. Before it's too late.The film's story unfolds in an unconventional manner. We see the present-day Derek, a man determined to do good, to change himself and save his brother. This is intercut with flashbacks which show us the monster Derek was. When the film opens Derek is about to be released from prison. When we go back in time to see how he ended up in jail it is shocking and disturbing to say the least. We see a man consumed by hatred and anger. He tears his family apart. He destroys his own life. And he does it all with a sinister smirk on his face. The saddest thing is that Danny idolizes his older brother. Danny is a skinhead too, proud of it. There was a time Derek would have been proud of what Danny had become. That time has gone. Prison changed Derek. How exactly it changed him is told in quite vivid, brutal detail. And when it becomes clear who it was who eventually reached Derek, changed his way of thinking, it all begins to make sense. The path to Danny's salvation appears. There is only one person who was ever really going to be able to change Danny and that was his brother. But Derek had someone very important on his side to help things along. That help had better come quickly. Danny may be too far gone, time is running out.It's a captivating film with an undeniably powerful story. But it's not a film without flaws. While Edward Norton is magnificent as Derek there's the sense Edward Furlong, playing Danny, struggles to keep pace. When Norton and Furlong share the screen, and they share the film's most important moments, there's the sense that Furlong just doesn't measure up. There's a certain level of maturity required to handle the very challenging role and Furlong seems to lack it. There are times it's hard to take his character seriously and that's a problem in a film as deadly serious as this one. The film also has a bit of a disjointed feel to it. The nonlinear structure works but not all of the pieces really end up fitting properly. This probably has something to do with the fact the film was taken out of director Tony Kaye's hands and reassembled by others, most notably Norton. There are places where the narrative just doesn't flow freely, the film bogs down. Kaye has said he wanted to make a tighter, shorter film. It probably would have been better if he had gotten that opportunity. The film also does a rather poor job of establishing the roots of Derek's hatred. One flashback dinner conversation with his father is all we really get and that sequence doesn't really work. It's as if it had to be tossed in because there had to be something there at the root of all this. But it's not enough. And then Derek's prison transformation, again not entirely convincing. You don't let go of that much hatred that quickly.In one of his earlier racial diatribes Derek had invoked Rodney King, the man who famously asked, 'Can we all get along?' The old Derek thought Rodney King was some kind of subhuman, the scum of the earth. The new Derek wants us all to get along. But we can't. Some of us have gone too far down the path of hatred and bigotry. You may want to change yourself. But it's hard to change the world. Derek wants to leave his old life behind. More importantly, he wants his brother to leave that world of hate behind. The clock ticks. Time is not on Derek's side.",7,0,2,31 December 2012
No Strings Attached," Very predictable, reasonably enjoyable
","It is what it is. No Strings Attached is another formulaic romantic comedy. OK, there's a bit of a twist in this one in that the couple doesn't actually want any romance. They skip the love and go straight to the sex, no strings attached indeed. There will be no feelings involved. Wham bam thank you ma'am. Same time tomorrow? But golly gee, these two just might start developing feelings for one another after all. Who ever could have foreseen that? There's a sense of inevitability about this movie from the very first minute. You know where it's headed. The movie may be on a journey to an obvious destination but at least it does a reasonably decent job of entertaining you along the way.Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman play the couple in question, Adam and Emma. Kutcher is never likely to win any major acting awards but he is serviceable in fare such as this. He's just a big lug, endearing enough. And it's important here that he be endearing because in this movie it's obvious from the start that it's his Adam, not Portman's Emma, who is more open to the idea of love. You need to feel for Adam as he goes through the movie's tried and true romantic comedy formula ups and downs. Kutcher pulls off what is required of him. Portman meanwhile shows off a different side. After the dark, ultra-serious Black Swan it's nice to see her able to just cut loose and have some fun. This movie is certainly not uproariously hilarious but it has its funny moments and Portman plays her part, showing some comic chops. And of course she shows her vulnerability too because the rom-com formula demands it.The arc of their respective careers has shown Portman to be clearly the more talented of the two leads in this movie. But Kutcher holds his own, he and Portman make a good match. The chemistry isn't perfect, the sparks never really fly. The movie tries to be raunchy at times but never really commits to it, ultimately the whole thing is a bit tame. No cinematic masterpiece to be sure but there are enough good moments to carry the film to respectability. All in all it's pretty good fun. The very simple story is spiced up a bit by some interesting supporting characters. Kevin Kline is a hoot as Adam's dad, a total cad. Lake Bell draws some laughs as an incredibly socially awkward woman who pines for Adam. Greta Gerwig, Mindy Kaling and Chris Bridges (yes, 'Ludacris') are among the others who wander in and out of the movie to provide a laugh or two. There's also a largely unrecognizable Cary Elwes who sadly gets absolutely nothing to do, a bit of a waste his casting was. Of course, as with all movies of this genre, the whole thing really rests on the shoulders of the lead couple. It's their movie. And Kutcher and Portman do enough to both entertain you and actually make you care about their characters. No Strings Attached is not a movie that rises above its genre, it doesn't stand out in any meaningful way. But for what it is it's not half bad.",6,2,4,31 May 2014
Tropic Thunder," Oh, the hilarity!
","This movie is outrageous. And a touch absurd. OK maybe more than just a touch absurd. Turns out there can be great fun in absurdity because this movie is utterly hilarious. Writer/director/star Ben Stiller has crafted a film which is dead-on perfect in its skewering of the Hollywood industry. Imagine that, Hollywood producing a big-budget motion picture which points out the absurdity of the Hollywood culture which produces big-budget motion pictures. Well played Mr. Stiller. Well played indeed.Tropic Thunder is a laugh riot right from its very beginning. Actually the laughs start before the film itself properly begins with a series of fake trailers which introduce us to our four main characters, the actors who will set out to make the greatest war movie ever. There's Brandon T. Jackson playing rapper Alpa Chino who sees his role in the film as an opportunity to promote his energy drink more than anything else. Stiller plays Tugg Speedman, a Stallone kind of action hero attempting to save his career after a foray into serious acting went less than well. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy who specializes in flatulence humor and who has a nasty heroin habit. And then there is Robert Downey Jr. who ultimately steals the show with his portrayal of Australian Oscar-winning method actor Kirk Lazarus. Lazarus is white. The character he has signed on to portray is black. So Lazarus has undergone pigmentation alteration to make himself black. Yes that is as stupid as it sounds. And the ultimate effect is funny as can be.Anyhow the filming of the greatest war movie ever does not go according to plan and the director decides to film guerrilla-style in the jungle. Unfortunately that plan gets blown to bits. Hilarity ensues as our actors wander through the jungle and find themselves in the middle of a conflict that's all too real. The plot really is absurd but it works perfectly. So many funny moments, so many memorable lines, so many great performances. Downey shines as the white man playing the black man, Lazarus seemingly having convinced himself he really is black. His back and forth with Jackson's Alpa Chino, a real black man, is priceless. Stiller is very good as well. Black's character comes off as a bit of an afterthought but he's OK with what he's given to work with. And so many other familiar faces pop up as well. Most memorably there's 'that guy' playing studio executive Les Grossman. Oh dear Lord is he funny. All in all Tropic Thunder is a brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed comic treat. You will see few movies which are any funnier.",9,0,1,1 July 2009
Enchanted," I am indeed enchanted
","Giselle, a beautiful young peasant woman, lives in the animated fairy tale kingdom of Andalasia. She dreams of finding true love. True love finds her when the dashing Prince Edward saves her from a giant troll. Yes, this is one of those animated kingdoms with giant trolls. Talking animals too but more on them later. It's also one of those animated kingdoms with an evil queen. Queen Narissa knows that she can not allow her stepson Edward to marry. If he does his new bride will take Narissa's throne. So when it's love at first sight for Edward and Giselle, with a wedding to take place just a day after they met, Narissa has to take action. She banishes the naive, all too trusting Giselle to...New York City? Good luck finding true love there sweetheart.Giselle has not just been sent from Andalasia to New York. She's been sent from an animated world to a live-action one. So out of the sewer and into Times Square steps Amy Adams. And Adams proves to be an absolutely amazing living, breathing, real-life Disney princess. You wouldn't want to imagine any other actress in the role, Adams is as perfect as perfect can be. In this ultimate fish out of water story the challenges Giselle faces are enormous. But as any good fairy tale princess would she faces those challenges with a smile on her face and a song in her heart. It is impossible not to be charmed by the relentlessly upbeat, positive-thinking, romantic idealist Giselle. And so much of the credit for that has to go to Adams who is stunningly brilliant in the role. She certainly looks the part of the fairy tale princess and her personality shines through to the point it's almost a little overwhelming.Of course modern-day Manhattan is really no place for a naive, idealistic fairy tale princess. Luckily for Giselle she is taken in by a single father, Robert, and his young daughter, Morgan. Robert was just about to propose to his girlfriend Nancy but Giselle's presence causes complications. Meanwhile, because this is a fairy tale after all, Giselle's Prince Charming must come save her. Tipped off by Pip, Giselle's talking chipmunk friend, Edward learns where Giselle has been sent and comes to New York to save her, chipmunk in tow. Unfortunately in the real world animals can't talk so Pip faces all kinds of problems of his own as he tries to help Edward find and rescue Giselle. While animals can't talk here Giselle does find a way to put the local wildlife to use. No cute little chipmunks here though, in Manhattan it's pigeons and rats and cockroaches who Giselle puts to work. Quite funny that. Anyhow Narissa knows she can't let Edward bring Giselle back to Andalasia so she sends her henchman, Nathaniel, to New York to finish the job with, what else, a poison apple. Edward is oblivious. It's only our fearless, though now unfortunately speechless, chipmunk who realizes the danger Giselle is in. More hilarity ensues as prince and chipmunk seek to find Giselle.Enchanted keeps a smile on your face throughout. The story is so engaging, the characters so embraceable. Adams is the obvious standout but the rest of the cast is excellent as well. Patrick Dempsey is perfectly cast as Robert, a guy all too grounded in the real world to believe in fairy tales. The exasperation Dempsey shows as his character deals with the impossibly chipper Giselle is priceless. Whereas Giselle begins to adjust to the real world she finds herself in Prince Edward never changes. He's a swashbuckling fairy tale prince brought to life and James Marsden captures that wonderfully. Susan Sarandon as the evil queen, Timothy Spall as her put-upon henchman and Idina Menzel as Robert's girlfriend are all great too. It's such a lively, energetic, flat-out fun film. The film looks fantastic, a fairy tale beautifully brought to life. There are some great songs too, the standout one being That's How You Know which is performed as a gigantic, breathtakingly brilliant Central Park production number. You may think this would be a very predictable story but the movie has some surprises for you, the quest for true love not as straightforward as it seems. If there is any little quibble with the film it may be that it goes a little over the top at the end where the villain becomes, quite literally, too big of a presence. But all in all it's hard not to love this movie. Such a charming movie, with a performance from Adams which is as good as it gets. Adams creates a character who anyone, fairy tale prince or real-world man, would fall in love with. If you love her, and you will, you'll love this movie.",8,1,1,29 March 2014
The Commitments," Dublin soul
","Bring a bunch of destitute Dubliners together to form a soul band. Crazy? No, brilliant. Jimmy Rabbitte is the young man with the dream. He's unemployed (who isn't?) but that's OK because he has the idea, the passion that will change everything. Drawing from the down-and-out youth of Dublin he's going to put together the world's greatest band. And he has just one type of music in mind: soul. Does this make any sense? Not to anybody else. But Jimmy's got the vision. And somehow it all begins to come together. His band, The Commitments, is on its way. But it's not a straight ride to the top. There will be struggles and conflicts and life lessons along the way. But the journey is worth it because, despite all the odds stacked against them, it turns out The Commitments are one heck of a band. Playing their wonderful, unique, rockin' Dublin soul.It's a great ensemble cast that makes up this movie's band. Robert Arkins plays Jimmy, the guy who brings it all together. And then the musicians do their thing. Never for a moment do you not buy into these performers as a real band. Their acting is fine but it's the music they play that makes the movie shine. Unlike so many other movies of this type almost all the singing and playing is actually done by the actors themselves. And when The Commitments cut loose this movie rocks. Jimmy Rabbitte might take exception to that. It's not rock, it's soul. Whatever it is it's absolutely bursting with energy. And that is thanks largely to one exceptionally talented young man. While everyone in the band plays their role well there's no way around it, Andrew Strong is the star. Unbelievably just 16 years old when the film was made, Strong plays lead singer Deco Cuffe. And he's got the voice of a singing god with the charisma and star power to match. But there's a problem. Deco is a completely insufferable jerk. Everyone else in the band hates him, and rightly so. Deco may well tear this group apart.The movie follows the band's rise, with all the drama Deco causes threatening a fall before they hit the big time. Which would be a shame because this band is awesome. When first thrown together they understandably make a stuttering start. But once they get their act together they are something to behold. The music they play is fantastic and it makes the movie so much fun. Whether performing a tender ballad or a really rocking number The Commitments hit all the right notes as they run through a soul classics songbook. Try A Little Tenderness and In The Midnight Hour are two obvious highlights but every song really works, not a musical misstep to be found. The music is so great it largely overshadows the rest of the film. The story largely takes a back seat but there are plenty of good moments in between the big musical numbers too. For as good as he is on stage Strong is also excellent portraying the boorish lout Deco offstage as well. Arkins is terrific as band manager Jimmy, holding his band of misfits together. One other standout is Johnny Murphy as Joey 'The Lips' Fagan. He's the wise old hand of the group, a trumpet-playing philosopher who's played with all the greats. Here is a man who appreciates the journey. He also appreciates the opportunity to bed the band's three lovely female backup singers. The band in this movie goes on a magical ride. And lucky us, we get to go along. This movie is a rollicking good time. Dublin soul rocks.",8,4,7,21 October 2011
Quantum of Solace," A big step backwards
","We begin with a rather absurd car chase. This is followed almost immediately by a rather absurd chase on foot. Very soon after that we get an absurd boat chase. And just in case you're clamoring for yet another absurd chase sequence they toss in an airplane chase later on. Say, shouldn't there be a story in here somewhere?After being reborn to very good effect in Casino Royale there is no way around it, the Bond franchise has taken a huge step backwards with Quantum of Solace. Casino Royale gave us a more grounded, serious, believable Bond. It also gave us a story with some heart, Bond actually being allowed to love and to ultimately have his heart broken. There was some actual emotion involved. Even though the story in Quantum of Solace picks up seemingly minutes from where Casino Royale left off all the emotion has disappeared. Instead of taking the time to further develop the character of Bond they turn him into just another action hero. Anything which has, over all the myriad Bond films, made the character unique has been stripped away. Now he's just another guy jumping off rooftops, surviving unsurvivable chases and fleeing exploding buildings. This is a Bond film which just doesn't feel like a Bond film. Which might be forgivable if there was at least a compelling story to follow. There isn't.With all of the largely worthless, manically edited action sequences there hardly is any room for a story at all. It takes a painfully long time for the movie to reveal what it actually is about. And when it does it is a massive letdown. When the villain's big scheme is finally revealed the only sensible reaction is 'That's all there is?' Really, we sat through all the headache-inducing jump-cutting nonsense for that? The big villain himself is a total dud. He goes by the name of Dominic Greene and he's just as boring and nondescript as the name suggests. This has to be the most lifeless Bond villain ever. Mathieu Amalric plays the part and it's hard to blame him for the character's failings. There's really nothing for him to work with. Where have all the grand Bond villains with their loony, dastardly plots gone? At least you can always count on a Bond girl to spice things up right? Nope. Olga Kurylenko plays the part of Camille and again a bland name suits a bland character. Camille's pretty much a complete bore and the chemistry between Kurylenko and Daniel Craig is essentially nonexistent. Playing a secondary Bond girl Gemma Arterton makes a bit better impression but she doesn't have enough screen time to really impact the proceedings in any significant way.Really the only good thing you can say about this movie is that Craig does make a good Bond. He proved that in the first movie. Unfortunately here he is let down by a story which is often hard to follow and which in the end reveals it really wasn't worth following anyway. Casino Royale had some real heart to it, this movie has none. The story is so bad you get the sense director Marc Forster is trying to distract you with his largely incomprehensible editing. If nothing is on the screen for more than two seconds before the next quick cut can we really complain about what we've seen? This movie never gives you time to comprehend what you've seen which come to think of it might actually be a good thing. If you think about this story you're only going to be disappointed. Lame story, lame villain, lame Bond girl and a James Bond who's more lame action hero than the James Bond we've come to know and love. By the time the movie in tosses in a desperate Goldfinger homage/ripoff it comes off as a rather pathetic attempt to remind you that this actually is a James Bond movie. After Casino Royale allowed the Bond franchise to take a big leap forward Quantum of Solace is a huge step back.",5,7,10,19 April 2011
Independence Day," Today we celebrate our Independence Day!
","Nobody is ever going to confuse Independence Day with any kind of work of great cinema. It's fun though. Sure, it's cheesy and corny. Often absurd and ludicrous too. But fun. As big, huge, visual effects summer blockbusters go you could do a lot worse. The aliens have come and they're gonna blow things up real good. And for this movie that's enough. Yes, the dialogue is mostly inane and terrible. Yes, there are some characters who disappoint, adding nothing of any substance to the proceedings. Yes, the movie goes on too long. For any movie of this type two hours will more than suffice. Independence Day careens well past that two-hour mark with a misguided attempt to inject some actual plot lines, some drama and real human emotion, into the movie. Plot? Drama? Emotion? Who needs any of that? Aliens invade. Humans fight back. The end.It's easy to bemoan what Independence Day isn't. But you can certainly embrace it for what it is. If you're willing to buy in, and ignore the fact that so much of the movie makes no sense at all, Independence Day can be a rollicking good time. Will Smith is perfect for this sort of thing, Jeff Goldblum falls perfectly into his world-saving scientist role, Randy Quaid makes for an entertaining kook and Judd Hirsch provides some laughs. Some of the other performers admittedly don't fare as well. Harvey Fierstein is an over-the-top annoyance, Brent Spiner makes his bizarre scientist much, much too bizarre to take at all seriously and the key female characters, played by Margaret Colin and Vivica A. Fox are pretty much worthless, total bores. And then there's the President, played by Bill Pullman. Confronted with a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, not to mention personal loss, the guy seems utterly devoid of feeling. My country's three biggest cities were just destroyed? Eh, whatever. An inspiring figure this guy is not. Until all of a sudden he is as, before humanity's final assault, he gives one of the most awesome movie speeches ever. OK, the speech is totally cheesy and corny. But awesome. Of course that final assault is based around a plan which is incomprehensibly absurd, defying all logic and reason. Logic and reason have no place in this type of movie. If you accept that than this movie is easy to enjoy. It's the end of the world as we know it. And I feel fine.",7,0,2,21 May 2011
Gone with the Wind," Beyond epic
","There are epic films...and then there's Gone with the Wind, the epic of all epics. This is a grand, monumental film. Its place in the history of motion pictures is secure. And so is its place in the hearts of so many millions who have enjoyed it all these years. Many movies are enjoyed. Few are truly cherished. This is one of those few. As new generations continue to discover the film Gone with the Wind just rolls on. It's a movie which will never die. After all, tomorrow is another day.Who, in 1939, could have imagined as immense an undertaking as what Gone with the Wind would prove to be was even possible? One man could, producer David O. Selznick. He had the audacity to believe he could pull something like this off and by sheer force of will he did it. He went through multiple directors, multiple writers, and a seemingly endless stream of potential Scarlett O'Haras. It was a production unlike anything Hollywood had ever seen, epic in every way. Somehow Selznick managed to pull it all together. Risk big, win big. Gone with the Wind was a monumental risk, it was either going to be an epic disaster or an epic triumph, there was no in between. What a triumph it would turn out to be.The love affair between Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara is at the heart of Gone with the Wind but the film is so much more than that. It's a long, circuitous journey for Scarlett before she eventually finds herself in Rhett's arms. And what a fascinating journey it is. Scarlett O'Hara is quite simply one of the greatest characters in film history. From the film's opening moments, the sweetness of 'Fiddle-dee-dee', all the way to the end Scarlett evolves, grows and changes right before our eyes. She discovers an inner strength, a bravery and resolve she didn't know she had. Along the way, she certainly has her missteps. Her drive and determination lead her to do some things which are unkind at best. And the undying affection she has for the man she truly loves, who is not Rhett Butler, will cause nothing but heartache for all involved. But for whatever foibles she may have you can't help but root for Scarlett O'Hara. Even if you don't mind seeing her get her comeuppance now and again. The ups and downs of Scarlett's life make for one of the most compelling stories ever seen.Part of what makes Scarlett such a great, memorable character is of course the performance of Vivien Leigh. Perfect. Utterly perfect. One of the greatest performances in the history of film. Scarlett grows and evolves and Leigh traces the journey perfectly throughout. From Leigh's first moment on the screen you can't take your eyes off her. Her stunning beauty is immediately obvious. Her immense talent would reveal itself as the story plays out. Of course Leigh is not the only great performer on display. If you can't imagine anyone but Leigh as Scarlett the same can be said for Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, a true Hollywood legend in a role which suits him absolutely perfectly. There's also the brilliant Olivia de Havilland playing the incredibly good-hearted Melanie, a character who serves as a wonderful counterbalance to the at-times self-centered Scarlett. She may not be as glamorous as Scarlett but it's easy to see why any man who came to know her would fall in love with the wonderfully devoted Melanie. Which brings us to Ashley Wilkes. He marries Melanie and he no doubt loves her. But he has feelings for Scarlett too, trying to deny that would be useless. And Scarlett has more than feelings for him, she has an obsession. Leslie Howard plays Ashley and one minor nitpick with the film is that Howard is probably too old for the role. His performance is fine, he just doesn't fit his part perfectly as Leigh, Gable and de Havilland do theirs. There are plenty of supporting players who add a great deal to the film. Thomas Mitchell, Hattie McDaniel and Harry Davenport are just a few of the key performers in the generally excellent supporting cast which helps to bring this great story to life.Gone with the Wind is a movie of two halves. The first half, set against the backdrop of the Civil War is probably more dramatic. There's not as much action in the second half but there is plenty to appreciate in this part of the film as well as Scarlett and Rhett finally come together. It's a movie which manages to hold you spellbound for nearly four hours. No small achievement that. The story is wonderfully compelling and it's performed beautifully by the stellar cast. The film looks utterly fabulous, a real Technicolor marvel. The sets and costumes do so much in helping to tell this story, transporting us back to the Old South. Max Steiner's music is another perfectly fitted piece in David O. Selznick's mammoth puzzle. Selznick brought it all together to create a brilliant film which in its day was a monumental achievement and which to this day is still absolutely beloved. A timeless classic which will live forever.",9,2,3,1 July 2011
No Country for Old Men," Powerful but oh so depressing
","If you're looking for a feel-good movie you most certainly have come to the wrong place. This is one seriously depressing film. So if you're not in the mood for that sort of thing perhaps you'll want to pass on this one. But if you do skip it you'll be missing a film which, depressing though it may be, is undeniably powerful. There may not be much inherent drama in the plot. The movie is essentially just a slow-speed chase. Will the bad guy catch the good guy? That's the movie in a nutshell. But somehow it all seems rather captivating. Perhaps that's because the bad guy is one of the most memorable, menacing and impossibly frightening movie villains we've ever seen.Javier Bardem plays Anton Chigurh, the villain. Anton is pure evil personified. But somehow this completely inhuman character is utterly fascinating. Full credit to Bardem for creating a simply unforgettable character. Anton Chigurh may well haunt your nightmares for a while after seeing this film. He is a sociopathic assassin and in this film Llewelyn Moss has the misfortune of being Chigurh's prey. Moss, who is played by Josh Brolin, comes across a drug deal gone bad in the wide-open Texas plains and with everyone around lying dead he is able to make off with a satchel containing two million dollars. Moss is the good guy, so to speak, but he's certainly not the typical movie hero. But when hit-man Chigurh is sent after him to retrieve the money you can't help but root for Moss. And that's basically it. Moss on the run, Chigurh chasing him and a whole lot of bloody violence along the way.Unfortunately there are many times during this movie where things slow down and not a whole lot of anything is going on. Chigurh chases Moss...and chases him...and chases him...and, well you get the point. Occasionally we cut to Tommy Lee Jones, playing the small-town sheriff Ed Tom Bell investigating the botched drug deal and its aftermath. Bell is old-school and world-weary and prone to homespun philosophizing about the new brand of violence he must confront. Jones is very good in the role but in all the scenes in which his character is the focus it is as if the movie is just biding time until the next violent outburst. And there are certainly plenty of violent outbursts. Other characters wander in and out but the movie is really all about Moss and Chigurh. And while Brolin is fine in his role it is Bardem you will long remember in his depiction of unrelenting evil. A great character but one great character does not make a great movie. There are some great pieces here. The movie is beautifully shot, there are many moments of almost unbearable tension and drama and Bardem's performance is breathtaking. But there are too many moments where the story drags, the plot is rather bare-bones and the whole thing kind of peters out at the end. For a film which had so many incredibly tense moments throughout the ending is rather mundane, very much abrupt and somewhat disappointing. All in all No Country for Old Men may be depressing but it's still a good film. It's just not a great one.",7,0,4,4 September 2008
District 9," Science fiction with smarts
","In so many ways District 9 is not your typical science fiction film. For starters, a South African slum is certainly not your typical sci-fi setting. It's a unique location for a unique story. And that story is presented in an unusual fashion, initially a mockumentary of sorts with more straightforward storytelling as we move along. It may take a little while for the viewer to become comfortable with the rhythm of the piece, things are a little disjointed at the start. But eventually the story kind of settles itself down and the viewer can then settle in and enjoy the ride. And a thoroughly entertaining and thought-provoking ride it is. You won't see many movies quite like this one and in this case that uniqueness makes it rather special. A first-time feature film director, Neill Blomkamp, with a limited budget, takes a cast of unknowns and creates a near-masterpiece. There are some things here and there to quibble with but overall the film works wonderfully. And Blomkamp deserves so much credit for that as this is a film which for so many reasons could easily have gone off the rails entirely. The potential was definitely there for this to be a complete mess. Instead it is a rousing success. That a first-time director pulled this off is somewhat mind-boggling.As our quasi-documentary tells us at the film's start, in 1982 a large alien mothership became apparently stranded, hovering motionless over Johannesburg, South Africa. And there it sat for three months until a team is sent up to break into the ship, where they discover over one million starving aliens. But these are not your typical movie aliens, these things look like some kind of giant seven-foot tall shrimp. These creatures, which will come to be referred to rather derogatorily as prawns, are for humanitarian reasons relocated to the ground where they end up living in the world's strangest slum, District 9. Nearly three decades pass and human-prawn relations are, to put it mildly, not going particularly well. So as the film's story begins to play out in its 2010 time frame the prawns are to be evicted from District 9 and forcibly moved to a new internment camp away from Johannesburg. Placed in charge of this forced relocation is the rather hapless office worker Wikus Van De Merwe. Poor Wikus is not quite up to the task.When we first meet Wikus it is obvious almost immediately that this guy is not the brightest bulb. In fact he seems to be such a bumbling, oblivious idiot that it is hard to identify with him or take him seriously at all. Which is a bit of a problem as Wikus is the central character in the movie. But as the story plays out Wikus evolves in innumerable ways. And when his story arc is complete than you can really appreciate how far this annoying little office twerp has come. Sharlto Copley is the actor entrusted with this vital role and he does wonderfully with it. At first things with Wikus did seem a bit off and you couldn't help but wonder if maybe it was because this unknown actor was in over his head. But as the story plays out you can't help but appreciate Copley's work and in retrospect you realize his performance in the film's opening wasn't off at all. It was exactly what it had to be for the character of Wikus. For long stretches of the film Copley has to carry the proceedings pretty much entirely on his shoulders and he proves more than capable.District 9 will prove to be mostly about the journey of Wikus but the prawns certainly have their part to play as well. Most of these creatures, impressive-looking though they may be thanks to some wondrous special effects, are rather disposable in the film. They're nameless, essentially faceless, with no real story to them. But one prawn, named Christopher Johnson (no I don't know how these things got names), has his own story and inevitably Christopher's tale will be intertwined with that of Wikus. And their story keeps you glued to the edge of your seat all the way to the film's rousing finale. OK, maybe the finale is a little too rousing as the emotional, thought-provoking story gets somewhat shunted aside for a standard movie shootout with all kinds of fancy CGI explosions. You get the sense this unique story deserved a little better in the end. But it's by no means a total letdown, the film as a whole ends up being more than satisfying. The story is terrific and it's told in a rather ingenious way. And, somewhat remarkably considering the small budget, the film looks terrific. The prawns, the spaceship, the weaponry, everything looks top-notch. It makes you wonder what the filmmakers could have done with a lot more money at their disposal. With as successful as this film was we may yet find out. District 10 anyone?",8,0,3,10 April 2010
Batman Begins," Starts slowly, picks up steam, ends with a bang
","Batman Begins, the Batman movie that is not actually about Batman. This is the story of Bruce Wayne. The fact that Bruce Wayne will eventually be Batman is almost besides the point. It takes a lot of guts to try and resurrect a comic book movie franchise without having the comic book hero in question appear in the film until it is halfway finished. So give director Christopher Nolan his due credit for having the guts to tell the Batman story in a way it had never before been seen on the big screen. The film he gives us is not perfect by any means but it's certainly something worthwhile and, most importantly, something different. Batman Begins is a refreshing change from the same old, same old we've seen before.Batman Begins sets out to tell the story of how exactly Bruce Wayne became Batman. As conceived by Nolan, Bruce Wayne's journey is quite a remarkable one. And in a story that is so much about one man's personal journey the actor playing Bruce was always going to be critical, with the film's success ultimately dependent on his performance. Christian Bale does not disappoint. His performance is spot-on. Intense or light-hearted, brooding or playful...whatever is called on in the moment Bale delivers. Bale's performance is the key but there are plenty of other standouts as well. Michael Caine as Bruce's trusted butler Alfred and Morgan Freeman as scientist Lucius Fox, who should get as much credit as Bruce himself for 'inventing' Batman, are both excellent in their roles. Gary Oldman gets to play a good guy for a change as Lt. Gordon and brings real heart to the role. Gary Oldman's got a heart, who knew? Cillian Murphy is appropriately creepy as the villainous Scarecrow, Liam Neeson is reliable as ever as Bruce's mentor at the outset of his journey in the film. Perhaps the only disappointment is Katie Holmes who in neither looks nor actions ever seems mature enough to be believable in the role of an assistant D.A. which she is given. But that's a minor quibble, her screen time is fairly minimal and she's not that bad, she's just not very good either. She's just kind of there.The story here is an ultimately fascinating one but it does take some time to get going. The film begins with Bruce Wayne's rather extensive training with the mysterious Neeson character and you may after a while find yourself saying, 'Be Batman already!' But it is nice to get a different spin on the Batman character and ultimately the payoff is worth the wait. Christian Bale makes a good Batman and he's an excellent Bruce Wayne, which in this film is clearly the more important of the dual roles. It may begin slowly but the film picks up steam throughout and builds towards a surprising and exciting climactic final showdown. There are a few lulls along the way but ultimately Bruce Wayne's journey is one well worth seeing.",7,0,0,7 August 2006
Liar Liar," Settle down Jim
","In Liar Liar you get pretty much everything you would expect in a Jim Carrey comedy. You've got your physical humor, your screaming and shouting and, of course, you've got lots of mugging for the camera. Carrey never met a camera he couldn't make a funny face into. In some of his movies all of this Carrey being Carrey stuff works perfectly. This movie however leaves you wishing he could have dialed things down a few notches. There are moments here where the typical Carrey zaniness works. But there are more moments where Carrey's outlandishness overwhelms the story. Which is too bad because unlike some of his other movies where the outlandishness was the whole point this movie actually has a story you can really appreciate. The movie is actually rather charming but you get the sense it would have been even more so if only Carrey could have reined himself in a bit. You just wish that Carrey and director Tom Shadyac had trusted their story a little bit more and let the story carry the movie. Instead this becomes just another typical Jim Carrey movie. Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with typical Jim Carrey movies. It's just that this one had the potential to be something a little different and a little better than that.In this movie Carrey plays lawyer Fletcher Reede, a man very focused on his career. And certainly not nearly as focused as he should be on his young son Max. Fletcher is separated from Max's mom and whenever he sees his son it seems all he does is make promises he can't or won't keep. And then comes the fateful day when Max, upset that Fletcher has failed to show up for his birthday party, makes a wish that his dad could not tell a lie for an entire day. And when that wish immediately comes true the consequences for Fletcher are immediate. Having to tell the truth all the time can really get a guy into trouble. Not to mention make it rather difficult to do your job when you're a lawyer whose whole case is one giant fabrication. Hilarity ensues. All that Carrey being Carrey stuff. Some of that stuff is admittedly quite good but some of it does miss the mark. There's a great story in there about Fletcher trying to reconnect with his son but too often that story gets lost amidst all the Carrey shenanigans. Carrey overshadows everyone and everything else in the movie. Which is too bad. Yes, you know Carrey's the star of the movie. And yes, you know Carrey's going to do all the things which made him a star in the first place. But this movie called for a little less wackiness, a more grounded performance. Here Carrey had a good story and a couple of other really good performers, most notably Maura Tierney playing Fletcher's ex-wife, to work with. But he just couldn't help himself. Jim Carrey was going to be Jim Carrey, with all the contortions and overacting and relentless mugging that entails. And in the end, despite all its potential, that makes this just another Jim Carrey movie.",6,0,1,27 June 2010
The Princess Bride," A magical movie
","A grandfather sits down to tell his sick grandson a story. And what a magical story it will be. There's fencing, fighting, torture, revenge...and kissing. The grandson may not have any interest in a 'kissing book'. But he will find that he can't help but be swept away, utterly transfixed by the story of The Princess Bride.This is a story of true love. And true love is a very special thing. True love can triumph over anything. Evil princes, six-fingered counts, rodents of unusual size, a Fire Swamp, a Pit of Despair. Maybe true love can even triumph over death if in fact you are only mostly dead. The two central figures in our romance our young Buttercup, played by Robin Wright, and simple farmhand Westley, played by Cary Elwes. Just as soon as Buttercup and Westley come together they are torn apart. Buttercup goes on to be a very unhappy princess. What happens to Westley? Perhaps better to ask what doesn't happen to Westley? This guy is put through the wringer. But he never gives up on his beloved Buttercup. You never give up on true love.Elwes is absolutely magnificent in this movie, perfect in every moment. He's got the humor, the look, the athleticism and heroism and vulnerability. Whatever is required in the moment Elwes delivers. And as the Princess Bride herself you could hardly do any better than Wright. She looks absolutely radiant, like any fairy tale princess should. And she pours everything she has into the role. You can see Buttercup's heart break when she believes Westley to be gone. The audience can't help but fall in love with her just as Westley did and for that give Wright so much of the credit. Even a modern-day boy who doesn't like kissing books will fall in love with Buttercup.For as wonderful as Elwes and Wright are the fun doesn't stop with them. This movie is perfectly cast all the way through. Chris Sarandon and Christopher Guest are wonderfully hissable villains. Wallace Shawn is so funny as a criminal 'mastermind' who overestimates his own intelligence. For the giant Fezzik could there be anyone other than Andre the Giant? As the grandfather and grandson respectively Peter Falk and Fred Savage are terrific. Falk is the perfect narrator and Savage has his own amusing take on the story. There's a brilliant, hilarious cameo from an unrecognizable big star hidden away under old-man makeup as Miracle Max. Because every good fairy tale needs a miracle right? And perhaps most memorable of all is Mandy Patinkin. 'Hello! My name is Inigo Montoya! You killed my father! Prepare to die!' This is a movie which has something for everyone. Action, adventure, comedy, romance and some of the most quotable dialogue ever put to film. A brilliant script from William Goldman brilliantly executed by director Rob Reiner and his wonderful cast. Someone not loving this movie would be would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways inconceivable.",8,0,0,20 December 2012
Saving Private Ryan," Real heroes in the real hell of war
","If it is possible to make a majestic film about a hellish war Steven Spielberg has done so. With Saving Private Ryan Spielberg beautifully blends the arts of filmmaking and storytelling. With such an accomplished director at the helm it is no surprise that this is such a technically proficient film, that it looks so spectacular, so real. But this film is so much more than the stunning, often horrifying, visuals. This is a film with a magnificent, inspiring story. And Spielberg tells that story so well, taking you through the emotional wringer. Tom Hanks leads an outstanding cast, Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is breathtaking, John Williams provides a powerful and at times haunting score. And credit must also go to screenwriter Robert Rodat whose story is so incredibly compelling. So many people contributing so brilliantly to an absolutely fascinating film. Everyone did their part and Spielberg put all the pieces together perfectly.The film begins on D-Day with the Normandy invasion which of course could be an entire film in and of itself. This sequence is unrelenting, Spielberg sparing nothing in his depiction of the inconceivable violence on Omaha Beach. Never has any film so brutally illustrated that war is indeed hell. Thousands of men bravely face what for so many must seem to be a certain death. As the bodies fall and blood turns the sea red Captain John Miller continues to push his company forward. They make a critical breakthrough but at such cost. Miller, and we, look down at the carnage below on the beach. So many men lay there, having made the ultimate sacrifice. The camera focuses in on one of the dead, on his backpack we see the name: S. Ryan. And we know that this film, even as it tells the tale of a conflict which engulfed the whole world, is going to tell a very personal story.The Ryan we see lying on the beach is one of three Ryan brothers killed in action. A fourth Ryan brother, James, is missing in action having parachuted behind German lines. From Washington comes a very unusual, but very clear order. Captain John Miller is to find James Ryan. And send him home. Miller assembles a small unit from his company. Eight men will go out into the French countryside, still occupied by Germans mind you, to find and save Private Ryan. Eight men will risk their lives to save one. Suffice to say not all of the eight are particularly happy with this assignment. But orders are orders and off the men go, into the great unknown. No simple mission this. Danger lurks at every turn. Spielberg ratchets up the tension, keeping you on the edge of your seat. You care so much about these men because Spielberg, certainly with a great assist from screenwriter Rodat, has done such a fine job of allowing you to know them. These characters come fully formed. You feel you know them, really understand them, almost from the moment you first meet them. So many different personalities in the group. Credit of course must go to the actors portraying the squad, the performers bring these soldiers brilliantly to life. Hanks is the star, the leader, and he is excellent. But the other actors match him stride for stride. Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi and Jeremy Davies...none put a foot wrong. An amazing cast which does justice to an amazing story.It is the story which really sets this film apart. It is a film about war but really it is a film about one man. But maybe that one man is not Private Ryan. Ryan plays his part but is this story really about Captain Miller? An ordinary man thrust into an extraordinary situation. A leader of men, doing his duty. Doing whatever is necessary to get his men, and himself, home. Hanks does such a terrific job portraying this man who remains an enigma even to his own men. Sometimes you get the sense he is an enigma to himself. He has lost the sense of who he is, or at least who he used to be. War will do that to you. The worldwide conflict is ultimately fought by individual men. And Spielberg allows you to get to know some of these men. Ryan and Miller. And Horvath, Reiben, Jackson, Mellish, Caparzo, Wade and Upham. Each has his own story to tell. And seeing each of their stories play out takes us back to the film's opening, to Omaha Beach. So many men died there. No film can tell every one of their stories. But with this film Spielberg has honored them all. A film of staggering scope and awesome power but with a personal touch. That Saving Private Ryan did not win the Best Picture Oscar is sad, quite frankly absurd. But honoring the film is not really important. Honoring the men who died so that we may be free is what really matters. And this film does just that.",9,1,2,6 July 2014
Revolutionary Road," The hopeless emptiness
","At one point in this film the key characters, in discussing their own lives, mention the 'hopeless emptiness' of it all. And thus in one line of dialogue is the entire movie summed up rather neatly. Empty for sure and bordering on hopeless Revolutionary Road is pretty much an all-around failure. It's a movie about an unhappy 1950s suburban couple who feel trapped in their own little world. They're disappointed in their lives and harbor fanciful notions of somehow getting away from it all. They're suburban nobodies who want to be somebodies. If the audience could say anything to this screen couple it would probably be 'get over yourselves'.Revolutionary Road is one of those movies which goes out of its way to thoroughly depress you. That's fine but if it insists on depressing you is it too much to ask that it entertains you somewhere along the way too? No such luck with this movie. Entertainment value is practically nil, nothing interesting ever seems to happen. Frank and April Wheeler are unhappy. They fight, fight some more, make up for a bit, fight some more and bemoan how miserable their lives have turned out to be. This goes on and on for two hours as the audience tries to stifle yawns. Frank and April are terrible bores. Their friends and neighbors are bores. One of their friends has a rather insane son who pops in a couple of times to inject some personality and life into the movie. Michael Shannon plays that part and makes a better impression than any of the big stars do. At least his character does some memorable things. But his scenes are all too fleeting. All too soon we're back to Frank and April throwing fits about the terrible state of their lives. Which rings rather hollow when you consider 99 percent of the world's population would kill to have the 'boring', 'hopeless', 'empty' lives the Wheelers so detest. They have it pretty darned good but they've deluded themselves into thinking they deserve better. They don't. Their lives are just fine. Hopeless? Empty? Really, get over yourselves. Please.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are both fine performers and they make the best they can out of this mess. The performances aren't the problem, the story is. And the characters. Never for a moment do we sympathize with Frank and April and that right there would be enough to doom the movie to failure. Who can identify with these people? Who would want to? DiCaprio and Winslet took on rather thankless roles in portraying this couple. With all the bickering and fighting there is an opportunity for the stars to go somewhat over the top at times and engage in a bit of scenery-chewing. But aside from that you really wouldn't criticize them. The stars don't let down the movie, the movie lets down its stars. There is so little for them to work with. The story is not engaging at all. It's a dull, boring movie in which very little of consequence ever happens. As such maybe it does capture all that emptiness the characters feel in their lives. But it makes for an empty movie.",4,7,10,4 February 2011
28 Days Later...," Standard zombie fare
","28 Days Later is a zombie film that really doesn't have much of anything remarkable about it. It's certainly not terrific, but it's certainly not awful either. It's just kind of there. The film has a fascinating premise, some startling visuals and a few moments of mild terror. But it never really rises above the mundane, there's nothing that makes it truly stand out from the pack.28 Days Later follows Jim, played by Cillian Murphy, who awakes from a 28-day coma to find London completely deserted. The shots of the deserted city, with the perfect music to match, are haunting, probably the most memorable thing about the film. Jim will soon find the city is in fact not completely deserted as he comes upon a pack of zombies with murderous intentions. Rescued by a young man and woman, Jim will learn that all of London, indeed it seems all of Britain and possibly the world, has been infected with a rage virus that turns them into these murderous creatures. We soon meet a father and a daughter who have also managed to survive. The father is played by Brendan Gleeson, the most recognizable face in a film featuring mainly unknowns.The small band of survivors eventually make their way to Manchester where the film gets somewhat bogged down. It's almost as if the zombies become forgotten and we acquire some new villains who are all too human, all too normal and all too dull. Eventually things begin to move towards what is ultimately a rather unsatisfying conclusion. The film has some great visuals, some fine performances, including that of relative unknown Naomie Harris as Selena, one of Jim's companions on his journey, and a great story to tell. But what started with a great premise and the promise of some genuine thrills in the end falls rather flat. 28 Days Later goes out not with a bang but with a whimper.",6,2,3,3 June 2005
JFK," One true fact: this is a great movie
","How much of what Oliver Stone presents in JFK is actually true? Certainly not all of it. Certainly not none of it. There's definitely some truth in there but Stone obviously takes some liberties as well. It's quite a challenge to make a film that purports to be a true story when nobody actually knows the true story. You end up interpreting history rather than documenting it. Stone obviously believes there was a conspiracy in the JFK assassination so of course that is the story his film will tell. The conspiracy is presented as fact. And Stone certainly makes a compelling case. He hasn't solved the JFK case. But after watching his film you may well think he came much closer to doing so than our government ever has. Stone made a great film. And perhaps more importantly he made a convincing film. You're buying what he's selling.Stone uses New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison to make his case. Garrison was in fact the only man to ever bring anyone to trial in connection with the JFK assassination. It is Garrison's dogged investigation which drives Stone's film. There are so many obstacles in Garrison's way but he is determined to get to the truth. But in this case truth is almost impossible to find. Tales of shadowy conspiracy emerge but no matter how much Garrison digs it becomes evident he's never going to get to the bottom of this. He makes the best possible case he can given the circumstances. But the real truth, the scary truth, always remains elusive. Kevin Costner turns in an excellent performance as Garrison. He makes you believe in Garrison, makes you believe that this man is doing the right thing. Costner is the strong center around which the film builds. Everything swirls around him. And in this film there is always something, often many things, swirling. There's an awful lot going on. Stone's film careens past three hours and you get the sense it probably could have gone on for three hours more.The film does go on for quite a long time and it throws so much information at you. There is a lot for the audience to process here. But the film never really gets bogged down. It is entertaining, compelling and thought-provoking throughout. Costner is the standout performer but the rest of the cast is stellar as well. Gary Oldman makes for an eerily convincing Lee Harvey Oswald. Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci bring unique personalities to the roles of two possible conspirators. Jones is calm and suave as Clay Shaw, Pesci nervous and manic as David Ferrie. Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek and a host of others play their parts well. Familiar faces pop up in even bit parts, the likes of Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and John Candy helping to move the story along. No part, no performance, is wasted. Stone weaves his web expertly. It is a very tangled story, there is the sense that in the end maybe all the strands of the story didn't quite come together. But how could they? This film is a 'true story' in which nobody actually knows the truth. Ultimately Garrison, through a powerful performance from Costner, lays out his version of the truth. Through this character Stone tries to convince us. How much of what Stone presents you choose to accept as truth is up to you. You can question Stone's version of history. But there is no question that in JFK he made an excellent film. It may not be a perfect history. But it's a near-perfect film.",8,9,18,6 February 2015
Gone Girl," Chilling...but maybe not in the way you expected
","Nick Dunne's wife has gone missing. He pleads with the public for help in finding her and bringing her safely home. But the evidence clearly indicates that his wife has met a bloody end. Nick can protest his innocence and go through the motions of looking for his wife all he wants. To the police this is a murder investigation and he is the one and only suspect. Evidence mounts, motive is established. To say things don't look good for Nick would be putting it mildly. His only ally is his twin sister but Nick gives even her reason to doubt him. There's a media firestorm surrounding the case. Television loves it whenever an attractive young blonde woman goes missing. And Nick's wife is no ordinary pretty young thing. She's Amazing Amy, the inspiration for a line of popular children's books written by her parents. The police are all over Nick, the media have convicted him before he's even charged. The disappearance of Amazing Amy is the biggest cause célèbre in the nation. And the nation has decided Nick is the villain in this story. And then...Suffice to say Gone Girl is a film with the capacity to surprise. Things are not always what they seem. Screenwriter Gillian Flynn, working from her own novel, spins a fascinating tale. And in the ever-capable hands of director David Fincher that tale is brought to brilliant cinematic life. This film is captivating from beginning to end, with clever twists and stunning shocks sprinkled throughout. Fincher expertly guides you through a story which goes in directions you never could have expected. It's a story, and a film, with some real intelligence. This is a puzzle which was put together ever so well.Ben Affleck, playing Nick, provides a solid foundation upon which the film can build. Should we sympathize with this man? Or demonize him? It's an enigmatic character and Affleck does a fine job with it, keeping you guessing until you finally have the information you need to pass judgment on this man. For as good as Affleck is the real standout is Rosamund Pike playing Amy. Amazing indeed. You think Nick is enigmatic? Wait until you get a load of her. She has already gone missing when the movie begins so we meet Amy through flashbacks, seeing the happy start of her relationship with Nick and then the couple's sad spiral as their marriage falters. Ultimately the character of Amy goes to some very interesting places. This is a character who evolves in such a way that it is an extremely challenging role to play. And Pike nails it. An acting tour de force. There are a few key supporting roles, most notably Kim Dickens playing the detective investigating Amy's disappearance, Carrie Coon as Nick's sister and Neil Patrick Harris as a man from Amy's past. But it is Affleck and Pike who must carry the film and each, in their own unique way, proves more than capable of doing so. Their performances draw you into this story, make you emotionally invest in these characters. This is not a film you watch dispassionately, the characters and story grab you in such a way that you feel invested in the outcome. It's a film with thrills and chills, brilliant twists and turns. When the right combination of writer, director and actors comes together you can end up with something quite spectacular. Gone Girl is an example of that. Fascinating throughout this film is one to treasure.",8,0,2,27 February 2015
Django Unchained," A messy movie
","You would be surprised if Quentin Tarantino ever made a truly bad movie. But he has made a few which, though not bad, are somewhat disappointing. Django Unchained is one of those. Honestly, this movie is a bit of a mess. An intriguing mess, at times a very entertaining mess. But still a mess. The movie gets away from Tarantino somewhat. His grand vision for what he wanted the movie to be ultimately lets him down. He couldn't let go of any of that vision, couldn't restrain himself. He put it all up there on the screen. And it proved to be just a little bit too much.The movie takes place in the pre-Civil War South. It is a story about slavery and Tarantino spares nothing in portraying the awfulness and brutality associated with that particular Southern institution. The hero of the piece is freed slave Django, unchained as the film's title would suggest and free to seek vengeance. But for Django more important than seeking vengeance is finding, and freeing, his wife who remains a slave. He is aided by the rather odd German dentist Schultz who does not actually make his money in dentistry. Schultz has a rather different occupation, a rather bloody one. And he is very good at his job so the bodies pile up in a hurry. Schultz, the man responsible for freeing Django, takes the former slave under his wing. Django helps Schultz do his bloody work and eventually Schultz will help Django find his wife.From its very intriguing beginning in which we meet the very mysterious Schultz the movie grabs your attention and certainly piques your interest. You desperately want to know who this mysterious man is, what he's up to. However once those questions are answered the movie begins to lose some momentum. It often feels as if the movie is just biding its time until it gets to the real story, the plot to free Django's wife. In the meantime things drag. There are a number of scenes which seem completely unnecessary. A little more focus would have done wonders for this movie. As it is things don't really perk up again until we finally, after much meandering, meet the despicable plantation owner Calvin Candie. This loathsome individual is the man who owns Django's wife. How do Django and Schultz plan to free her? It's quite the elaborate plan which, for the movie, is a bit unfortunate as it takes so much time to set the plan up. We now have the new character of Candie to interest us, and hating him is quite good fun, but again the movie struggles with pace. The big moments in this movie are big indeed. But there is too much dead space in between those big moments. At 165 minutes long this is a movie that is much too long for its own good. The crackling energy you expect to be running throughout a Tarantino film is missing. The director lost his way a bit.So there is a twinge of disappointment with this movie. But that does not mean it is a bad movie. It clearly could have been better but as is it is certainly worth seeing. After seeing it once you may not want to see it again though, it is a somewhat distasteful movie. Tarantino is never one to shy away from violence and the gore in this one is off the charts, it's a real bloodbath. It's just too much, way over the top. In and around the spasms of violence there is a lot here to recommend the movie though. It's a good revenge story, you've got heroes worth rooting for and bad guys who are as bad as bad can be. The movie is generally very well acted. Jamie Foxx as Django and Christoph Waltz as Schultz make for a very good team. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't entirely convince as the villainous Candie. It is as if DiCaprio is trying a little too hard to be evil, it comes off as being a bit forced. But in the moments when Candie is charming, and yes even this monster has his charms, DiCaprio seems much more comfortable. Notably fine work is turned in by Samuel L. Jackson playing Candie's loyal house slave Stephen. In his own way Stephen is perhaps more reprehensible than Candie and Jackson does a fine job of making that character his own. Tarantino fills out his cast well, supporting parts and little cameo roles all handled capably by a multitude of performers. All in all this is a movie with a lot of good pieces but there is the sense the pieces don't all fit together properly. Tarantino didn't make a bad movie. But he didn't make a great movie either.",6,1,2,24 April 2014
Schindler's List," A hero amidst the horror
","Oskar Schindler did not set out to be a hero. He set out to make money. He was a war profiteer, making money off of the misfortune of Poland's Jews. They were cheap, easy labor. But somewhere along the way things changed. Schindler saw what was happening all around him. The extermination of a people was underway. And in these circumstances a hero was made. For Schindler it was no longer about making money. It was about saving Jews. His Jews. Amidst the darkness of the most unspeakable of horror there was a small light shining bright. Yes, the number of those who were saved pales in comparison to the number of those lost. But this story, and this film, shows us that there can be something good even where all seems so impossibly bad. Even in the worst of circumstances there is room for hope. There is room for a hero.Setting the right tone for this film seems an impossible task. You have to celebrate those who were saved. But you must also honor those who were lost. Steven Spielberg walked this fine line wonderfully. He told his uplifting story of Oskar Schindler. But the bigger picture was never lost. The horror of what took place comes through very clearly. Spielberg does not just tell the story of those saved, he makes it vividly and brutally clear just what they were saved from. The pain, anguish, horror and terror is all very real. Seeing the greatest evil the world has known on display is enough to make you lose your faith in humanity. Seeing the bravery and heroism of Oskar Schindler restores that faith.Spielberg was fortunate in that he had three terrific performers to work with. Liam Neeson played Schindler so beautifully. Here was a character who evolved so much over the course of the film and Neeson was pitch-perfect each step of the way. War-profiteering Nazi or heroic savior of Jews, whatever the moment called for Neeson nailed it every time while maintaining an air of mystery. Who was Oskar Schindler really, why did he do the things he did? He was an enigma who Neeson portrayed wonderfully. Ben Kingsley played Schindler's accountant Itzhak Stern. At first Schindler and Stern have very different motivations. But a bond is formed, a friendship blooms. And Stern plays his part in helping to save his people. A quiet, yet determined, presence whom Kingsley personifies so well. And then there is Ralph Fiennes portraying one of history's true madmen, the disgustingly evil Amon Goeth. Any story of a hero needs a villain and Goeth, as played chillingly by Fiennes, is as villainous as they come. Perhaps the scariest thing about him is that there are moments of humanity, kindness even. But in the blink of an eye the moment is gone and the homicidal monster is there before us. Kingsley is very good, Neeson is terrific but Fiennes absolutely takes your breath away. He makes this monster his own, an acting performance of the absolute highest quality.The three stars certainly play a big part in the success of the film. But Spielberg makes such great use of so many performers. Some play characters who we get to know a little bit. Many are nameless, just part of the multitude being led to the slaughter. The hordes in the ghetto and in the camps convey the magnitude and the great sadness of what went on. Spielberg holds nothing back in portraying the manner in which these people were dehumanized. And the specter of death always looms. It's a film of over three hours in length which does not seem nearly that long. It grips you throughout, never lets up, never lets you go. And there are some moments which are nearly unbearable, the tension unlike anything you've ever seen. One scene in a shower may well have your heart beating through your chest. And you're just watching, people actually lived this. This was such a challenging story to tell and Spielberg tells it so well. The Holocaust is an odd place to look for a hero. But here a hero was found. And Oskar Schindler's story is one we can all remember when we are ready to give up hope for this world.",8,10,16,10 July 2012
Across the Universe," A tale of two movies
","Across the Universe is a movie based on Beatles songs. Interesting concept. And for a little while an interesting movie. But the concept can't sustain itself over the movie's inordinately long running time. The story can't hold up for that length of time. And the story goes off in directions the movie would have been better off avoiding. What started out as a fun little movie with some great songs devolves into a boring, pretentious slog to the finish. The whole second half of the movie you're just begging to hear Hey Jude. Because in a Beatles-themed movie it's a pretty safe bet that when you hear Hey Jude we're quite near the end. Hey Jude doesn't come nearly soon enough.While it's the songs of John, Paul, George and Ringo which are at the center of the movie we never hear those famous voices. The songs are sung by the film's cast, mostly to surprisingly good effect. OK, there are a few duds in there but by and large the actors do the famous songs justice. Jim Sturgess does very well with the lead male role, a character conveniently named Jude. And in the lead female role, Lucy, Evan Rachel Wood is a revelation. She's fabulous. A couple of her early songs are definitely among the film's highlights. And they're a lot of fun too. Unfortunately in the second half of the movie fun is in short supply. Director Julie Taymor spends most of the film's second half beating you over the head about how horrible the war in Vietnam was. The movie is of course 40 years late to that party. When not going on and on and on about Vietnam the movie is basically just a psychedelic mess. Taymor drives her movie well and truly off the deep end. Things were going along just fine until a musical number which accompanies one character's induction into the military. If you were being kind the best thing you could say about the sequence is that it's bizarre. The truth is it's out-and-out stupid. Laughable. And sadly a sign of what's to come. The rest of the movie is either more of this tripped-out nonsense or anti-war drivel. OK, we get it. In the '60s people did drugs and thought war was bad. Can we move on? Please? Sturgess and Wood do an admirable job trying to hold together a movie which is falling apart around them. They act well, they sing well, and they have very good chemistry. When the story focuses on the relationship between their characters of Jude and Lucy the movie works. Unfortunately that focus is lost and the movie clearly suffers for it. The last hour of this movie is not just bad, it's painful. Not even Beatles songs can save this. And while the Beatles songs used earlier in the film tuck neatly into the story later on there are some rather curious song choices which seem rather forced and don't come off well at all. The songs may be performed well. But too many of them fail to make any genuine impact. And some of them are totally wasted in the psychedelic haze. By the time the movie finally stumbles across the finish line the end is a blessed relief. A movie which seemed to have great promise totally lost its way.",5,2,4,25 June 2012
I Am Legend," Legendary this movie is not
","Once again Will Smith is called upon to save the world. Only this time there isn't much of a world left to be saved. A virus has killed off pretty much everyone on the planet. Those who didn't die mutated into soulless bloodthirsty zombies. A lucky few were immune to the virus...but it seems they've all been killed by the zombies. Not so lucky after all I guess. In a deserted New York City where deer and lions roam free during the day and the zombies rule the night one man survives. That man is of course Will Smith. Well no, actually that man is military doctor Robert Neville, played by Smith. Because if the last man alive on planet Earth was actually Will Smith that would just be silly. But I digress. Anyhow Smith, er, Neville forages for food during the day and retreats to his heavily fortified home at night lest the zombies get him. Oh, and in his spare time, he tries to find a cure for the disease. A little late now one thinks but OK. If he can find some magic potion to turn hairless, mindless bloodsucking zombies back into ordinary human beings well then color me suitably impressed. So the movie slogs along with Neville and his dog wandering around Manhattan, having a few encounters with the zombie types and then going home. And then there are a few twists and all of a sudden the movie's over. Yeah, there's not a whole lot going on here.This is by no means a lousy movie but you get the sense it could have been a lot better. There are certainly some nice pieces. The shots of a deserted, overgrown Manhattan are spectacular. Smith does a highly admirable job in essentially carrying the movie all by himself. There are a few brief flashback sequences thrown in but basically the whole movie is Smith and his dog. Really, we could have used some more of those flashbacks to flesh out the story which really is bare-bones. OK, we get the general idea of what happened but it would have probably helped the film if we saw more of what went on as the planet's population was dwindling from six billion people to one Will Smith. As it is we're thrown right into the post-apocalyptic aftermath and we never really get to know enough about Smith's character. Which is kind of important considering his character is essentially the movie's only character.Another problem with the film is the look of the zombies. The filmmakers went overboard with the CGI and the creatures often come off looking more silly than menacing. And with their CGI-generated superhuman speed and strength it is hard to believe that these things were once ordinary people. And how is it that all these zombies come out looking exactly alike? Last I checked human beings don't all look alike and these things were human beings remember? That's one strange virus.In the end this ends up being a reasonably entertaining but somewhat disappointing movie. All too often there's just nothing going on. The one character the movie has is barely developed at all and the story is sorely lacking some background information to flesh it out. But the movie does have its moments. And you stick with it expecting that one big moment at the end but in that regard you may be left feeling a little let down. The ending confuses more than it inspires. All of a sudden the movie's over and you're left saying, 'That's it? Really?' Yeah, that's it. Kudos to Smith for pretty much singlehandedly dragging this movie to respectability but he can't quite bring it home. At least not as powerfully as you might like. Better luck in your next effort to save the world Will.",6,1,1,1 May 2008
Dog Day Afternoon," Plodding and predictable
","Dog Day Afternoon, in which Michael and Fredo Corleone rob a bank. Just a year after The Godfather: Part II Al Pacino and John Cazale are together again. This time they play two bank robbers, Sonny and Sal respectively, whose robbery does not go at all according to plan. With Pacino in the lead role casting Cazale was probably a mistake. For as great an actor as Cazale was when you see him with Pacino your mind can't help but go to Fredo. Again Pacino's the star while Cazale plays the quiet, somewhat dim-witted supporting figure. It's Fredo all over again and thinking about that takes you out of the experience of enjoying this movie. Then again there isn't necessarily all that much to enjoy here. The fact that Cazale's presence may lead you to think of the Godfather movies is not Dog Day Afternoon's biggest problem. This movie disappoints in other ways. Ultimately, despite a very good performance from Pacino, it proves to be quite a letdown.So the robbery goes horribly bad and Sonny and Sal find themselves trapped in the bank, surrounded by police, holding a bunch of unfortunate bank employees hostage. And then...nothing. Nothing much of consequence anyway. The movie plods along, incredibly slowly paced, rather devoid of drama. A crowd shows up, television broadcasts the unfolding events live and Sonny becomes an unwitting media star while Sal whimpers in the back of the bank. The story doesn't really move forward. Sonny and Sal are trapped...and they're still trapped...and they're still trapped...and can I get this two hours of my life back? There's a sense of inevitability to the whole thing. Once the situation has been established there are very few potential outcomes. This is all based on a true story but even if you know absolutely nothing about the real-life events it's not hard to guess how this is all going to turn out. Really the only twist in the tale comes when Sonny's wife shows up, revealing the motivation for the robbery. And well, that's quite a twist. So bizarre you wouldn't believe it if it weren't actually true. If it weren't true any screenwriter trying to pitch it would be laughed out of the room. If nothing else at least this provides for a bit of story and character development after all the time spent with Sonny staring at the cops and the cops staring at Sonny and absolutely nothing actually happening. Aside from the introduction of the wife the movie is a rather monotonous, predictable crawl towards the finish line. Pacino is very good but he doesn't have much material to work with. There's not much story here and what little story we have is hard to believe even if it is true. The robbery fails. The movie largely does too.",5,7,15,10 August 2011
Kick-Ass," Hit Girl kicks...well, you know
","If the idea of a foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl slaughtering people is just too repugnant for you then do not watch Kick-Ass. If you are willing to accept such an idea then there is much for you to enjoy in this movie. This movie is gleefully over-the-top in every way. And it makes for a rollicking good time. The movie has great wit, action and, surprisingly for a movie which is absolutely drowning in blood, charm. But make no mistake, for all the movie has going for it the best thing it has to offer is that pint-sized, potty-mouthed terror, Hit Girl.But before we get to Hit Girl a word about Kick-Ass since the movie is after all entitled Kick-Ass. Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski, an ordinary, anonymous teenager who decides to become a real-life superhero. He buys himself a cheesy costume, christens himself Kick-Ass and takes to the streets to save the day. And proceeds to get his ass kicked. But soon enough he manages to become an internet sensation...who's still getting his ass kicked. Enter Hit Girl. Begin the slaughter. She's got a costume but, unlike Kick-Ass, she's also got skills. And no qualms about hacking off a bad guy's limbs. She's been trained by her father who dresses like Batman and calls himself Big Daddy. This is one deadly duo. They're going to team up with Kick-Ass who, all things considered, might want to go back to being plain old Dave Lizewski.There is much to like about the movie. It's funny, it's exciting, at times downright exhilarating. Not everything works perfectly. A subplot where Dave's dream girl, Katie, suddenly becomes interested in him because she mistakenly thinks he's gay doesn't add much to the proceedings. Mafia boss Frank D'Amico, the main villain for most of the film, is not the most exciting of antagonists. A movie this far out there (and boy is this movie far out there) needs a more compelling adversary for our heroes. Happily Red Mist enters the fray. Yes, another weirdo in a costume.The one flaw with the film which is most clear is that the central character is nowhere near as interesting as the supporting players. Johnson gives a reasonably fine performance as Dave/Kick-Ass but the character is a little flat. Happily Hit Girl is here to liven things up. This girl is dynamite and Chloë Grace Moretz plays the part perfectly. A star-making performance. Moretz looks every bit the action star and is utterly convincing with the dialogue (including the raunchy stuff) and emotional scenes as well. And Moretz works beautifully with Nicolas Cage, playing Big Daddy. Cage decided to go way, way over-the-top with his performance and in this movie that works perfectly. He hams it up and he should be hamming it up, it's that kind of movie. Christopher Mintz-Plasse brings a very unique personality to Red Mist and, though her character seems a bit extraneous, Lyndsy Fonseca plays the part of Katie well. This is a pretty good movie up to the point we first see Hit Girl in action. From there the movie kicks into a higher gear and never lets up. Embrace the violence, enjoy the carnage, cheer on Hit Girl, one of the unlikeliest heroes you'll ever see. She kicks ass.",7,1,1,4 February 2016
Ghostbusters," Loved it as a kid? You might still like it today.
","Ghost Busters is one of those movies which when you were ten years old seemed like the greatest thing you'd ever seen and when you are thirty years old you wonder what all the fuss was about. It's certainly not by any means a bad movie but in retrospect it's not by any means a great movie either. It's a charming, but only intermittently funny, comedy with some jazzy (at least for 1984) special effects thrown in to liven up the proceedings.The plot of this movie is a rather simple one. New York City has a problem with ghosts and three scientists form a ghost-catching company. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis play the three original ghost busters with Ernie Hudson joining up later. Murray is undoubtedly the star. His character of Peter Venkman gets most of the best lines and as you would expect Murray delivers them brilliantly. Aykroyd and Ramis are fine in their roles but they'll never outshine Murray who is terrific whether delivering some sly, understated humor or being completely over the top and totally off the wall. Annie Potts as the Ghost Busters' receptionist, Sigourney Weaver as Venkman's potential love interest and Rick Moranis as Weaver's exceptionally nerdy neighbor round out the principal cast. Moranis in particular has some choice comic moments and his character of Louis probably trails only Murray's Venkman in the laughs department.With its solid cast and plenty of subtle, witty dialogue the movie has a lot going for it. And there are some rather exciting, and sometimes amusing confrontations between the ghosts and the Ghost Busters. The movie certainly has its moments but there are too many instances where the film just kind of sits there and the story struggles to move forward. But there is ultimately a great payoff in the end with an undeniably brilliant final scene. If you expect an all-time comedy classic you may well be disappointed but if your expectations are a touch more realistic you will find that Ghost Busters is a reasonably enjoyable film and that's not so bad.",6,2,5,28 August 2006
The Hurt Locker," Failing to get real
","Director Kathryn Bigelow tried to sell The Hurt Locker as a raw, gritty and above all else realistic look at the war in Iraq. In watching the film the problem with that becomes glaringly obvious. The film is not realistic at all. Bigelow strove for authenticity and missed the mark by a considerable distance. The characters in her story act in ways they simply could not and would not in the real world. Things are presented to us in this film which quite simply could not happen. By the time the main character is taking a solo nighttime sojourn through the streets of Baghdad the film has gone completely off the rails. It's ludicrous. And yet it manages to get even more ludicrous from there. Honestly, this deadly serious war movie ends up being somewhat laughable.The story focuses on a bomb disposal unit. The danger of their work is made quite clear to us right from the start. Coming in to lead the three-man team is William James and here the movie begins to lose its way. James is a gung-ho, yahoo cowboy type who ignores the rules, unnecessarily putting himself and his team in danger. The kind of guy who, in the real world, would never be given this job. Rightly frustrated to no end by James is his by-the-book comrade JT Sanborn. The third member of the team is the young, impressionable Owen Eldridge who just wants to get out of Iraq alive. The interactions between James, Sanborn and Eldridge are at the heart of the movie. The conflicts which arise between James and Sanborn are quite powerful and compelling. But there's the nagging sense that none of it rings true. No bomb disposal unit would actually operate in the way this team does. No way.This is a story which you would think would be fraught with tension, a bomb ready to explode at any moment. But you never really feel that. The film moves from one bomb to the next, the tension slowly draining away. It becomes rather repetitive and not particularly entertaining. Once the film really gets going you never get the sense it's going to shock you. And it's a film which could really use a good jolt. Some of the 'action' sequences are frankly interminable. The film's better moments are really spent away from the ticking bombs, getting to know something about the key characters and what drives them to be the men that they are. Jeremy Renner performs the role of James wonderfully and is ably matched by Anthony Mackie playing Sanborn. And Brian Geraghty, playing Eldridge, has his moments too. These three actors are probably the best thing the film has going for it. The actors are better than the story. The story just isn't believable, by the end downright farcical. The central character of James is a fascinating one. Just not a believable one. With a character it is impossible to buy into at its heart the film was never going to be able to truly succeed. It is a decent film, but one with serious flaws. A film which does not live up to its acclaim.",6,0,0,10 January 2013
Moulin Rouge!," Fabulous sights and sounds at the Moulin Rouge
","Christian and Satine fall in love and what a great love story it could be. Except this love, as the film tells us right at the very beginning, is doomed. So there could be a touch of melancholy to this whole film. But director Baz Luhrmann blows you away with the sights, the sounds, the frantic energy of the Moulin Rouge. How can you be feeling glum when you're having so much fun? This film draws you in and never lets you go. Yes, the singing and dancing are quite good fun. But there is that captivating love story too. We know there will be no happily ever afters. But we love Christian and Satine just as they love one another. You can't help but be charmed by this couple. And while giving you such a lovely couple to root for the film also gives you a dastardly villain to root against. The Duke, rich and powerful, wants Satine. But her heart belongs to Christian. The Duke does not like this. Not one little bit. Complications ensue.Initially Satine's heart does not belong to anyone. She does not feel she is free to love anyone. She's the star attraction at the famed Paris cabaret Moulin Rouge. She's a singer, a dancer...and a courtesan, which is a fancy word for prostitute. When the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler, needs someone to finance the club's new show Satine knows what she must do. She will make the Duke believe she loves him so he will finance the show. And this arrangement is not without benefit to Satine, this new show will perhaps give her a chance to be a real actress. But there's a little mix-up. She comes to believe that Christian, a penniless writer, is actually the Duke. By the time she realizes her mistake Christian is already totally smitten with her. And then the real Duke shows up and things could get really messy. But a song and dance number saves the day. In this movie, when in doubt, a song and dance number is always the answer.So the Duke ends up agreeing to pay for the show, which Christian will be writing. Of course Christian is much more interested in Satine than he is in the show. Eventually, through song of course, he will win her heart. Then it's a matter of keeping their love hidden away from the oblivious Duke. Satine starts spending all her time with Christian. For the good of the show you see. A girl's gotta rehearse, right? Wink, wink. This makes for a rather unhappy Duke and a very nervous Zidler who needs to keep the man with the money on board. Meanwhile, lurking in the background there is that knowledge that there will be no happy ending. The whole film is in essence told in flashback, Christian in 1900 telling us of the events which happened a year earlier. The Christian of 1900 is a completely heartbroken man, the movie tells us how he got to such a state. What had become of his beloved Satine?Right from the start director Luhrmann lets us know this film is going to be a little bit different. The film's events may unfold in 1899 but the songs Luhrmann uses are not of that period, it's a contemporary soundtrack. When Christian breaks out into some Sound of Music you think that's interesting. When you then hear a little Smells Like Teen Spirit it becomes clear that absolutely anything goes in this film. And all these songs which would seem to be so out of place work so perfectly. Some, such as Satine's renditions of Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend and Material Girl, are so fitting they may as well have been written for this film. Other songs are a bit more of a stretch but Luhrmann makes it all work. And as much as Luhrmann it is the cast who make it work, most notably Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman playing Christian and Satine. Their acting is wonderful and their singing is strong and convincing. And needless to say they look the part as well. McGregor has an air of innocence and immense likability. And it is certainly easy to buy into the breathtaking Kidman as the woman who makes Paris's collective heart race. Jim Broadbent is also notably excellent as Zidler and he gets the film's funniest musical number as well.This is a film with constant energy to it, full of life. It's a bit of a sensory overload. The costumes and color make for a visual feast. The songs are performed wonderfully, the dances are beautifully choreographed. The movie hardly ever stops to take a breath, it's constant motion. There are some moments where you wonder if the tone is quite right. The aforementioned Broadbent number is indeed funny but coming as the film takes a darker turn it seems a touch out of place. And then there are moments where maybe it gets a little too dark, where the Duke goes off the deep end and becomes too evil to take seriously. Yes, he needed to be the bad guy but not that bad. But these are small quibbles. All in all the film is a lot of fun. The story is engaging, the performances are terrific and the music kicks things up to a whole other level. You have your touching love songs and you have your wild, loud dance explosions. Every song, every snippet, serves a purpose. The film is somewhat over the top but gleefully so. It makes for great entertainment. Very fitting that the title of the show Christian is writing is Spectacular Spectacular. Moulin Rouge! is spectacular indeed.",7,0,2,2 September 2014
Back to the Future Part III," A rousing sendoff
","The first Back to the Future film was absolute genius. What a brilliant story, Marty McFly stuck in the past having to ensure his parents get together lest he be erased from existence. In Part II things got a little complicated and convoluted. Back and forth we went, from 1985 to 2015 to the hellish alternate 1985. And ultimately back to 1955, in fact right back into the first movie, Johnny B. Goode and all. Maybe it was at times a little hard to follow, maybe it wasn't quite as much fun as the original. But Part II was still an excellent film with a very smart, albeit complex, story. And that set us up for Part III which would prove to be a worthy conclusion to one of the greatest adventures of all time.When last we left our heroes Marty McFly was stuck in 1955 (again) and a bolt of lightning had just sent Doc Brown careening back to 1885. Doc is quite content to live out his days in the Old West. Through the magic of Western Union he has told Marty to go to 1955 Doc (keep your Docs straight) for help in returning to 1985. But Marty and 1955 Doc make a terrible discovery. Just six days after writing that letter to Marty the Doc stuck in 1885 will be shot and killed. 'Shot in the back by Buford Tannen, over a matter of eighty dollars' reads Doc's tombstone. As 1955 Doc puts it, 'What kind of a future do you call that?' There's only one thing for Marty to do, fire up the DeLorean and head back to 1885 to bring Doc home.From there it's a rather simple story, much simpler than either of the first two films. No more bouncing around the space-time continuum, no paradoxes to unravel the universe. It's basically just a Western. But as Westerns go it's quite a fun one. Seeing the Hill Valley of 1885, and its cast of characters, is quite a treat. There's another generation of McFlys for us to get to know. There's another Strickland, always the disciplinarians in that family. And of course, as in any good Western, there's a vile, odious villain. And in a Back to the Future film that villain just has to be a Tannen. Buford Tannen, call him Mad Dog at your own peril, makes his descendant Biff look like an innocent choirboy. Mad Dog more than lives up to that nickname he so despises. And there is one more important new character. Clara Clayton, a schoolteacher who greatly complicates Marty and Doc's return to 1985. Because Doc Brown, always the pragmatic man of science, has fallen head over heels in love with this woman who died decades before he was born. Seems maybe we'll have a paradox after all.So Doc decides rather than go back to 1985 he wants to stay in the past with Clara. Of course there's the small matter that he's days away from being killed. It all makes for great entertainment. No, it's not as brilliant a story as in either of the first two films. But this simpler story has so much charm. It's great to see Doc in love and Clara makes a perfect match for him. They're like two lost little puppy dogs, the connection between the two instantaneous and incredibly endearing. What kind of a woman could fall in love with Doc Brown? Mary Steenburgen does a great job in portraying Clara, the kind of woman who could do just that. With Steenburgen having the key female role Lea Thompson has only a bit part this time around. But it's great to see her, you can't imagine a Back to the Future film without her. Thomas F. Wilson is simply terrific as Mad Dog Tannen, a nasty villain whom Wilson infuses with wonderful personality. But of course, as ever, the headliners are Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd as Marty and Doc. One of the all-time great film pairings. Two great actors who were absolutely perfect for their respective roles. What a journey those two characters went on over the course of these three films. This third installment may not be as frantic as the first two. It's not bursting with excitement, it's a little slower, suiting its Old West time. After the grave consequences of Marty and Doc's actions in the other films the story here can seem a bit mundane by comparison. But it still entertains, it really is great fun. Maybe the fact the consequences weren't so grave allowed the film to let loose and just enjoy itself a bit. We get one last look at these characters we've come to know and love. And this film gives them the rousing sendoff they deserve.",9,3,6,23 January 2013
The Illusionist," A brilliantly conceived story brilliantly executed
","The Illusionist is one of those movies which not only demands a second viewing but demands a second viewing immediately after the first viewing has concluded. As soon as the closing credits begin to roll you'll want to go back and watch it again right that very minute to unravel this film's mysteries. What is illusion and what is real? The joy in this film is in finding the answer to that question.Set in Austria in the early 1900s The Illusionist has all the terrific visuals and costumes you would expect of a period piece. It also has terrific acting performances, most notably from Edward Norton as the title character, Eisenheim the Illusionist. Jessica Biel, after appearing in a string of altogether forgettable films in which she was required to do nothing more than look pretty, makes a bid to be taken seriously as an actress and absolutely succeeds. Rufus Sewell, who makes for a great villain, and the always reliable Paul Giamatti round out the key figures in the terrific cast. There is also a wonderful score by Philip Glass which sets just the right mood throughout. But for all the great visuals and acting and music what makes this film great is its story.The central figure here is Norton's Eisenheim who puts on a highly popular magic show in Vienna. One night Crown Prince Leopold, played by Sewell, attends Eisenheim's show and here things get very interesting. Considering himself to be quite the intellectual, Leopold will be exceedingly frustrated by his inability to expose what he feels must surely be sheer fakery by Eisenheim. He will soon be even more frustrated when it becomes apparent the woman he intends to marry, Duchess Sophie, as played by Biel, would much rather be with Eisenheim than with him. It turns out Eisenheim and Sophie were childhood friends and now they clearly wish to reconnect. But the Crown Prince stands in the way. When Eisenheim takes the opportunity to embarrass Leopold in front of the elite of Austrian society Leopold takes it upon himself to make things rather difficult for the illusionist. Leopold can, and does, threaten Eisenheim's career but that is of little concern to Eisenheim. He simply wants the girl. Suffice to say Leopold can make things rather difficult for Eisenheim in that regard as well.There are plenty of twists and turns along the way but it is hard to see how Eisenheim and Sophie, these ill-fated lovers, can ever be together. Leopold simply will not allow it and you do not argue with the heir to the throne. With the aid of Police Inspector Uhl, played by Giammati, whose position requires him to serve the Crown Prince's every whim, Leopold is determined to keep Eisenheim and Sophie apart and, just for good measure, expose the illusionist as a fraud as well. It is obvious that while Leopold is utterly dismissive, Inspector Uhl has a healthy respect for Eisenheim and his abilities. Just what is Eisenheim capable of? As the movie progresses Eisenheim changes his act and begins to perform an entirely different kind of illusion. No rabbit out of a hat stuff here. These illusions are utterly shocking and serve to incite Leopold more than ever which it seems can only lead to Eisenheim's arrest. What exactly is Eisenheim up to? Why would he put himself in such a position? It all comes back to the simple question...what is illusion and what is real? In the end, all is revealed. Well not all, because that wouldn't be very magical. But we learn enough to appreciate the brilliance of Eisenheim. And we also can't help but appreciate the brilliance of this movie's story and the exceedingly clever way in which it unfolds. It's a fascinating, thought-provoking story and it is performed wonderfully by a terrific cast. Watch it once and you'll want to watch it again and again.",9,2,3,14 March 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The curiously compelling case of Benjamin Button
","Benjamin Button was born under unusual circumstances. He was born old, a baby with the wrinkly appearance and multiple maladies of an elderly man. As everyone around him grows older it is Benjamin's fate to grow younger. Backwards Benjamin goes, from that wrinkly baby to a child confined by 'old age' to a wheelchair to an older-looking Brad Pitt. And then to just plain Brad Pitt and then a younger-looking Brad Pitt and...well, you get the point. Curious indeed. And this exceptionally curious life's journey is captured brilliantly. Pitt's performance in this incredibly challenging role is terrific. Obviously in this kind of story special effects and makeup are going to be critically important. If the effects fail the movie is doomed to fail. That proves to be no concern as this is one movie in which the special effects are special indeed. As Benjamin lives his life in reverse the whole thing actually seems plausible and believable. It looks real and for that the effects and makeup teams cannot receive enough praise. For as good as everything looks though the film still has to grab you emotionally to really work. The viewer has to really buy in to this story and director David Fincher crafts his tale in such a way that one can't help but become emotionally invested in the curious life's saga of Benjamin Button.At its heart this is a love story. Now how exactly, and with whom exactly, could a man like Benjamin Button fall in love? How is it possible for this man to share his life with anyone? The answer comes in the person of Daisy, a young girl whom Benjamin meets during his childhood. Of course during his 'childhood' Benjamin is by all appearances about 70 years old. But Benjamin and Daisy have an instant, if rather odd, connection. Nobody seems to really understand Benjamin. Somehow though young Daisy seems to get it. And their bond remains strong as Daisy grows older and Benjamin grows younger. The young girl growing older, the old man growing younger, destined to meet in the middle. It may be the most unusual love story you'll ever see but the love between these two is very real and incredibly heartfelt. It's a powerful, compelling and rather beautiful story which is always tinged with a hint of melancholy. Because when Benjamin and Daisy do eventually meet in the middle the unspoken truth is that they remain two ships passing in the night, headed in opposite directions. This really cannot end well can it? We shall see.This is a movie unlike anything else you'll ever see. Well, most anything else as many Forrest Gump parallels are obvious. But while that comparison does work somewhat the fact is Benjamin Button is an incredibly unique film. If this story fell into the wrong hands we could have been left with a film which was an absolute mess. But director Fincher steers this production beautifully. In so many ways it is an incredibly challenging story to tell and you get the sense not many people could have really pulled it off. Fincher does it wonderfully, helped immeasurably of course by Benjamin himself in the person of Pitt. What a long, strange character arc Benjamin has and Pitt is spot-on every step of the way. Having a wonderful actress in Cate Blanchett to play off of certainly doesn't hurt Pitt's cause. Blanchett's portrayal of Daisy is, as you would expect, magnificent. So many other characters float in and out of Benjamin's life and a terrific ensemble cast brings each and every person to wonderfully vibrant life. Such a large group of performers and it seems there is not one casting misstep. Credit again to Fincher for drawing out amazing performances from so many people. Maybe the film is a tad bit long but it's hard to say which scenes you could really do without. Benjamin Button led an amazing life and you can't help but want to see as much of it as possible. All in all it's a film which is a magnificent technical achievement but more importantly it's a wonderful story. And that story is told beautifully in what proves to be a thoroughly enjoyable and heartwarming film.",8,0,1,29 December 2009
Lincoln," Lincoln movie needs more Lincoln
","Lincoln is a movie with a rather disappointing flaw: it's not actually about Lincoln. This movie, which purports to tell the story of this iconic man, is not about the man at all. It is a movie about the process of getting an amendment through Congress. Two and a half hours of that unsurprisingly leads to quite a bit of boredom. Abraham Lincoln led such a fascinating life. None of that fascinating stuff makes it into the movie. Instead Steven Spielberg focuses solely on the last four months of Lincoln's life, focuses on just one of the many accomplishments of this great President. Yes, the passage of the 13th Amendment which abolished slavery is hugely important. But the story of the amendment's passage is not nearly enough to sustain a movie of this length. There has to be more to the story. A movie about the life of Abraham Lincoln would never be boring, would never fail to captivate. Unfortunately this is not that movie.The best thing the movie has going for it is undoubtedly the stellar performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln. Such a shame then that so much of the movie is spent away from the President, following others working on his behalf to get the amendment passed. This Lincoln movie desperately needs more Lincoln. It quickly becomes a movie more about political machinations than any sort of biography. And Congressional procedure does not make for a particularly interesting movie. Other actors, most notably Tommy Lee Jones as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, do their best. The movie is very well-acted, everyone in the enormous cast does a fine job. But you don't go into a movie titled Lincoln hoping to see some nice supporting performances. You go into it to see Lincoln. And the wonderful performance of Day-Lewis is largely wasted as there just isn't enough for him to do. The narrow focus of the film robs us of the opportunity to really see the story of this great man. Day-Lewis could have done so much with this role if given the chance to truly cover the breadth of Lincoln's life. A tremendous opportunity missed. In the end Spielberg has produced not a bad movie but surely a very frustrating one. You go into this movie hoping to really get to know Abraham Lincoln. You don't get to know him at all. Instead you learn more than you could ever want to know about how Congress works. There's a reason nobody makes movies about the House of Representatives.",6,0,1,29 April 2014
Empire Records," Entirely unremarkable
","Once upon a time there were these places called record stores. People went to these places to buy music. Empire Records is a movie set in such a place. The young employees of Empire Records band together to try and prevent their quirky, independent store being sold to one of those big, bad corporations which will turn the place into a soulless, generic Music Town. If they'd only known the changes which would be coming to the music industry in the next decade they wouldn't have bothered. Anyone up for Empire Records 2: The Day iPods Put Us Out of Business? Eh, probably not. One movie spent with this bunch of unremarkable, unoriginal slackers is enough.Empire Records is a movie which is overly familiar. We've seen so many similar stories with similar characters. There's nothing to make this movie stand out from the crowd. All the clichéd characters we've come to expect from a movie like this are here. The slut, the virgin, the depressed loner, the artist, the stoner. There's the eccentric guy, the comic relief guy, the father figure. Every character fits into a neat little box. The result is less than inspiring. The movie is incredibly predictable. There's no real drama. Attempts at comedy fall flat. The whole thing seems very unfocused. All the characters have their own little stories. But we never really spend enough time with any of those characters to become fully engaged in those stories. Everyone and everything gets tossed together into a big stew and the end result is underwhelming. Some of the performances are pretty good, with the girls generally coming off better than the boys. Watching this movie it's easy to see why Renée Zellweger, Robin Tunney and Liv Tyler were destined for bigger and better things. The guys though are rather forgettable. Probably the best male performance comes from Maxwell Caulfield playing a washed-up pop star. At least his character adds a little something different to the movie. Otherwise it's all about this group of young slackers, none of whom has an individual story which stands out and whose overriding collective quest, to save the store from corporate blandness, isn't particularly compelling. The best thing the movie has to offer is its soundtrack, a nice mid-1990s musical time capsule. But tossing some snippets from some good songs into the mix, and somehow managing to entertainingly shoehorn Gwar into the plot, isn't enough to save the movie. We've seen a lot of other movies like this one. Most of those other movies have been much better than Empire Records.",5,0,1,8 June 2011
Million Dollar Baby," Not a knockout but a solid effort
","In some ways Million Dollar Baby is as simple as movies get. It's a story about three people. And one of the three seems to be there really just to tell you some things you otherwise might not know about the other two. The two principals in question are aging boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, played by Clint Eastwood who also directs, and the aspiring female boxer he will soon train, Maggie Fitzgerald, played wonderfully by Hilary Swank. The only other character of any great significance, played by Morgan Freeman, is Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris. Scrap, a former boxer himself, now helps Frankie with the operation of his rather seedy boxing gym. But perhaps more importantly for the film, Scrap serves as the narrator who tells us things about Frankie and Maggie that otherwise would have taken too long to flesh out. We get to know Frankie and Maggie as much through what Scrap tells us about them as by what we see them doing ourselves.The three main characters are brought together by boxing but it's really not a boxing movie. It's more about the life's journey of Maggie Fitzgerald and how Frankie, a man near the end of his own journey, will help her fulfill her destiny. Maggie and Frankie's unlikely partnership drives the movie forward and Swank and Eastwood each do a great job in bringing their characters to life. As the determined and somewhat naive underdog Swank shines. Very few actresses would have been able to handle the emotion and the physicality of this role. Swank absolutely nails it. Eastwood's character has a lot bubbling under the surface and initially we're not really sure if we should like this guy. But despite his initial misgivings (he is very emphatic in stating that he doesn't train girls), Maggie brings out the best in him. They have an unusual but undeniably strong bond and they go on a fascinating journey together.The story is an intriguing one, the characters are compelling and the acting, from Swank especially, is excellent. But Million Dollar Baby seems to lack a certain energy driving the film forward. For much of the film it seems we're just biding time waiting for the inevitable climactic fight. And that climactic fight? Well, it's how shall we say, quite interesting, and certainly puts a different spin on all that has come before. Part of the charm of movies is in delivering the unexpected but I'm not sure how many will be charmed by the climactic events here. In the end, Million Dollar Baby is certainly powerful, thought-provoking and full of emotion. No all-time classic but a fine story well worth seeing.",7,0,0,27 July 2005
Garden State," You can go home again. Can't you?
","Garden State is about Andrew Largeman, a young man who after many years away returns home to rediscover himself. Or maybe discover himself for the first time. On an abundance of psychiatric drugs since childhood Andrew goes through life in an almost catatonic state. He feels nothing. And his life is going nowhere. He lives in California, an actor without much work who makes ends meet by waiting tables. When his mother dies he heads back to New Jersey for her funeral. In Andrew's case home is definitely not where the heart is. We will soon see that there are very good reasons he has cut himself off from his home life, from the world he once knew and has no desire to return to. But a funny thing happens. Off his meds for the first time in ages Andrew's world begins to open up. He's feeling things again. Home begins to feel like home, but not because of his family or friends. It is a girl he has just met who changes everything, who opens Andrew up to the possibilities of finally finding out who he really is and living a life all his own.This is a coming of age story with great charm and the most credit for that of course goes to Zach Braff. This movie is his baby, he's the writer, the director, the star. As a writer he plotted out a great story. As a director he framed that story beautifully. And as a star he brings to life an incredibly compelling character. Andrew Largeman has never really had a life to speak of but when he returns home everything changes in a matter of days. And Braff wonderfully captures the feeling as Andrew takes his tentative first steps out into the world. Braff is certainly helped by the fact he has a wonderful performer to play off of in Natalie Portman. She plays Sam, the quirky girl who changes Andrew's life. Andrew falls for her immediately and why wouldn't he? She's the type of girl who once you get a hold of you never want to let her go. But will Andrew allow himself to embrace the possibilities presented by this new relationship? Or has he been scarred too much to ever really love at all?All in all Garden State is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. It's fascinating to watch Andrew try to finally construct a little life for himself. It's emotional as you watch him try to come to grips with his past. And it's heartwarming as you watch him begin to love this young woman who comes out of nowhere to change his life. Braff is very good in playing Andrew but it's Portman who is really the scene-stealer. Sam is a strange young girl, a compulsive liar who somehow is still relentlessly charming. And at least she admits she's a liar and apologizes for it. Sam is vulnerable, she just chooses to protect herself in a different way than others might. Portman captures all this girl's myriad quirks beautifully and creates a truly memorable character. Braff plays off of her and the chemistry between the pair is probably more than anything else what really makes the movie work. At its heart the movie has that great coming of age story. And Braff shoots the film beautifully, a visual love letter to his home state. The collection of songs Braff chose to use in the film fit so well, the soundtrack ultimately picking up a Grammy Award and serving as the final perfectly fitted piece to a very well-constructed film. In the end Garden State is a charming, entertaining and thoroughly satisfying film.",8,1,1,11 December 2010
Caddyshack," Be the ball
","More than thirty years after its initial release Caddyshack is now regarded as a comedy classic. People know it, love it, quote it. But does anyone even remember what this movie is actually about? It's the story of young caddy Danny Noonan, played by Michael O'Keefe, who is trying to finagle his way into a caddy scholarship for college by kissing the proper behinds. But all these years later nobody ever mentions poor O'Keefe or his character when they talk about this movie. Because Rodney Dangerfield stole the show. Or maybe Bill Murray stole the show. And wait, there's Chevy Chase too. Poor O'Keefe never stood a chance. His character may have been at the center of the movie's story but this is not a movie about story. This is a movie about laughs. And with Dangerfield, Murray and Chase involved there are certainly plenty of laughs to go around.So when looking back on this movie you don't focus on the story. You just think of your favorite moments. For many people the majority of those moments seem to revolve around Murray's character of grounds keeper Carl Spackler, a simple man who has total consciousness awaiting him on his deathbed. There's that Dalai Lama bit. There's his wonderful 'Cinderella story'. There's his swimming pool snack. And there's the one scene Murray's Carl shares with Chase's Ty Webb, two comic geniuses in a brilliant back-and-forth. Chase's character is more or less a reserved straight man in the movie though he definitely gets his zingers in too. Not at all reserved is the outrageous Dangerfield who holds nothing back with his blustery, scenery-chewing performance. He'll do or say anything for a laugh. Dangerfield's character of Al Czervik has a lack of tact and good grace which really gets under the skin of Judge Smails, played wonderfully by Ted Knight. The stodgy judge could use a proper nemesis and in the outlandish Al Czervik he more than meets his match. All the good stuff from Murray and Chase and Dangerfield and Knight overshadows O'Keefe. Heck, poor O'Keefe even gets overshadowed by a gopher. The movie may be nominally about young Danny Noonan but it seems that director Harold Ramis knew the big laughs would come from elsewhere and just let the rest of his cast go nuts and do what they do best. And it works terrifically. Yes, some of the jokes and gags fall a little flat. The movie has some fits and starts, doesn't consistently keep up the laughs all the way through. But when it hits it hits big and all in all there are more than enough laughs to cover up a few rough spots. Maybe the movie could have done with just a little bit more attention paid to its actual story. And there are some other characters floating about we might have liked to have spent a little more time with. For instance Cindy Morgan, playing the stunning temptress Lacey Underall, could have been given more to do. In this movie where story is left on the back burner it's really all about everyone in the cast making the most of their respective moments. And everyone does. Even the gopher.",7,0,2,15 September 2011
The Piano," Out of tune
","Holly Hunter, without saying a word, turns in a remarkable performance in The Piano. It's a shame that performance is stuck in such an unremarkable movie. This is a slow, plodding, grim and quite dull movie. Hunter creates a compelling character but the movie really has very little else going for it. The whole thing is rather pretentious. This is a tough movie to get through.The story unfolds in the mid-19th century. Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a mute Scotswoman who has been sold into an arranged marriage to a New Zealander, Alisdair Stewart. So after a long journey Ada comes ashore in New Zealand. She brings two very important things with her. Her young daughter, Flora. And her piano. Playing the piano is the way this woman who cannot speak expresses herself. She pours her heart into her piano playing. So suffice to say her relationship with Alisdair gets off to quite a rocky start when he decides he can't be bothered transporting the piano to his home and leaves it to rot on the beach. This is not going to be a happy marriage.Alisdair ends up selling the piano, which mind you isn't even his, to his neighbor George Baines. Ada is of course enraged. Further enraged when Alisdair orders her to give George piano lessons. George is a very simple man. He can't read. He has adopted many of the local Maori customs, including tattooing his face. Why does this crude man want to learn how to play the piano? Well he doesn't. He wants Ada. He just wants to watch her play. They come to an arrangement where she can earn her piano back by letting him do things while she plays. And the things George wants to do are not at all innocent. Maybe he'll start by just looking up her skirt. But before long they're naked and in bed. Well, what's a girl to do when she wants her piano back, right? Anyhow, this whole arrangement goes badly because George actually has affection for Ada but she's just using him to get her precious piano. And of course there is the small matter of Ada's marriage to Alisdair. That loveless marriage, with its complete lack of affection, greatly frustrates Alisdair. That frustration will manifest itself in rather terrible ways.This all seems like it could make for an interesting story but for whatever reason the movie just doesn't work. It is not entertaining at all. The whole thing is so bleak, perfectly matching its backwater setting. Hunter does so well to convey so much emotion without even speaking. You always know exactly what Ada is thinking, great credit to Hunter for being able to convey that. The role of Ada's young daughter turns out to be a critical one and Anna Paquin does well with it. Flora is an intelligent, mischievous little schemer and Paquin's performance is very good, very mature. An Academy Award was probably a bit much though. Whereas Hunter and Paquin shine the men in the picture don't come off nearly as well. Admittedly they're not helped by a script which gives them some rather clunky, awkward dialogue. Harvey Keitel plays George and never really seems comfortable in the role. Meanwhile Sam Neill's portrayal of Alisdair falls hopelessly flat. This is a movie largely about passion but it comes across as almost entirely passionless. It's a movie that is badly out of tune.",4,2,7,3 May 2015
Jerry Maguire," There's more to life than money
","You wouldn't think a sports agent would be a good choice to be the central character in any kind of romantic film. It is a profession with a reputation for sleaze and slime. But Jerry Maguire is not your typical sports agent. Well, he is at the start of the film. But then he has an ethical epiphany. Unfortunately this epiphany gets him fired from his high-powered agency. Jerry is left with just one client, Rod Tidwell. Rod, a wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, is brash, bold, bombastic and exceedingly self-confident. And with regard to Jerry he is interested in only one thing: 'Show me the money!' When Jerry is cast out on his own with his one client he also has only one employee for his new start-up agency. That is Dorothy Boyd, a single mother who apparently was the only person at Jerry's old agency who shared his ideals. Or who was willing to admit she shared them anyway. She leaves her secure job to take a chance on Jerry and it becomes clear pretty quickly that she may have made a big mistake. But as Jerry flounders professionally he and Dorothy grow closer. They come to count on one another. They fall in love. At least they think they do. Their relationship is a challenge, a love story which it turns out may not include much love at all. Did they come together for love or for convenience? They know true love when they see it, as they do in the rock-solid relationship between Rod Tidwell and his wife. Seeing what Rod and his wife have only makes it more painfully obvious to Jerry and Dorothy what they are lacking.So this is a rather challenging romantic film. The main characters don't fall instantly in love and settle into a life of constant bliss. If this relationship is to succeed they are going to have to really work at it. It is an interesting journey Jerry and Dorothy take and director Cameron Crowe was fortunate to have two excellent performers filling those key roles. Tom Cruise and Renée Zellweger were at the top of their games here, playing off one another beautifully and creating two truly outstanding characters. The actors are certainly helped by Crowe's terrific dialogue, this is a script with so many memorable lines, both funny and poignant. Of course Cruise and Zellweger don't get all the best lines for themselves. Cuba Gooding Jr. shines, injecting so much life into the movie playing the outrageous Rod Tidwell. Bonnie Hunt provides some laughs as Dorothy's wary sister. Kelly Preston is a stunner, both in looks and in what she says as she plays another woman in Jerry's life. And there is also room for a wonderfully precocious child, Jonathan Lipnicki being incredibly endearing in that part. There's also Jay Mohr, Jerry O'Connell, Regina King, Beau Bridges...it is a really long list of quality performers and Crowe gives them all their moments to shine. There is a sense the movie struggles at times with the balance between comedy and drama. Is it a comedy that's trying to be dramatic or a drama that's trying to be funny? And how do you squeeze a romance into that mix? Oh, and it's sort of a sports movie too. Crowe really does have a lot going on here, maybe a little too much. But by and large it works. The movie manages to both entertain and charm you. And it is great to see the characters grow. Maybe even Rod Tidwell can come to learn that it is not all about the money.",7,1,1,24 October 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," Needs some minor adjustments
","David Norris is a rather arrogant fellow. As well he might be as he is a Congressman who is expected to coast to victory in his upcoming Senate race.

He loses that Senate race and, humbled, makes a candid concession speech which goes over so well he immediately becomes the favorite to win the next Senate race a few years down the line. In this speech, by laying himself bare and talking from the heart, David really connects with people. He'd really like to thank the person who inspired the speech. That would be Elise who is...a woman he just met in the men's bathroom? This intriguing woman might change David's destiny. And that is a problem. David and Elise were never supposed to meet. Says who? Some mysterious men in fedoras.David and Elise have their restroom moment and then she's gone. David would very much like to find her. The men in hats would very much prefer he not do so. And they have strange powers which enable them to keep David and Elise apart. But then one of the men in hats screws up, David bumps into Elise and things start to get really, really weird. The men in hats are from the Adjustment Bureau. David catches them in the act of doing some adjusting on people in his life. They can change people's thoughts, ensuring that everything unfolds according to The Plan. What plan? The Chairman's plan. Who's the Chairman? David would surely like to know but the Adjustment Bureau is not going to be forthcoming with any such information. All they need David to know is that if he reveals their existence to anyone he will be 'reset' which is a cute way of saying lobotomized. And he is not to see Elise ever again.So of course David becomes more determined than ever to see Elise. The Adjustment Bureau throws obstacles in his path, David overcomes them. Eventually the Bureau has to call in the big gun, Thompson, the scariest dude in their arsenal. Thompson provides a little insight into the Bureau. He provides a little insight into why David is so important. And he makes it perfectly clear that he will have no qualms about crushing Elise to make sure David sticks to The Plan. Can love overcome? This is all very intriguing but as the movie plays out it is not quite as exciting as one might hope. Things get rather muddled, bogged down. For much of the film's running time there is not much energy to it. Matt Damon gives a good performance as David, a character who is initially unlikable who we very quickly start identifying with and pulling for. Emily Blunt is also quite good as Elise, creating a character who is instantly intriguing and always interesting. Easy to see why David would fall for Elise. Damon and Blunt have good chemistry but, seeing as the whole point of the movie is their two characters being kept apart, they are not ever really together long enough for that chemistry to pay great dividends. The Adjustment Bureau is of course shrouded in mystery. That mystery doesn't pay itself off as well as you might hope, instead of a big finish things sort of fizzle out. Questions are raised about humanity's free will but those questions are not really answered satisfactorily. In the end it doesn't quite all tie together. There's some good intrigue here, some good romance too. Damon and Blunt do very well, drawing you in and making you really invest in this relationship which, for reasons unknown, is not allowed to be. It's an intelligent film, one which makes you think. So there's a lot the film has going for it. There is the nagging sense though that the film falls just a little bit short of the greatness which seemed to be within its grasp. Maybe a slight adjustment here or there...",7,0,0,19 December 2015
Black Snake Moan," A rather odd little movie
","Here we have the charming Deep South tale of Samuel L. Jackson finding beat-up nymphomaniac Christina Ricci lying unconscious by the side of the road and bringing her home to cure her of all that ails her by chaining her to his radiator. Wait, run that by me again? Yes, it's safe to say you haven't seen many movies like Black Snake Moan. There's a lot of weirdness for sure and the movie certainly does have a number of flaws. But when you put the total package together the movie does seem to work, but by just the slimmest of margins. It's not a great movie, it's not an awful movie. It's OK. You could do a lot worse.Anyhow, as detailed above, the plot is rather simple. Jackson plays Lazarus, an old blues musician who nowadays makes his living as a vegetable gardener. His wife has just left him and this deeply religious man's faith is being sorely tested. Ricci plays Rae, whose boyfriend has just gone off to war, and now this rather disturbed young woman is looking for sex with pretty much anybody anywhere. After one encounter ends rather poorly (to say the least) she's more or less left for dead on the road leading to Lazarus' house. Lazarus scoops her up, brings her home and...chains her to the radiator? Lazarus is certainly determined to cure Rae of what ails here, both physically and emotionally. His methods? Quite interesting that's for sure. But he's not going to let this woman go until she's cured. Thus the chain. And thus begins one of the strangest relationships you've ever seen in any film.For material such as this to work the two principal actors are going to have to be very much on top of their games and Jackson and Ricci are up to the task. Their solid performances allow you to buy into the admittedly strange story being presented. This material requires the actors to take some chances and really go for it to sell this story and Jackson and Ricci sell it well enough to make the film passable. The film has some lulls and the story is after all a little bizarre but it works more often than not. You even get a few pleasant surprises as Jackson does a pretty fine job singing some blues tunes. And Justin Timberlake, playing Rae's boyfriend, turns out not to be as completely terrible an actor as you might expect him to be. Well, a backhanded compliment is better than no compliment at all right? All in all it's a film which has its lesser moments but the good marginally outweighs the bad.",6,1,4,20 February 2008
Rudy," Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!
","If you don't like Rudy you have to be just a terribly cynical and rather unhappy person. It may not fit the mold of what are generally thought to be 'classic' films. But few movies will make you feel any better. This is as uplifting and inspiring as cinema gets and if you can't see that then I feel sorry for you. How anyone could not be left with a smile on their face after watching this movie is beyond me.The film's story is actually rather simple. Daniel 'Rudy' Ruettiger grew up in Illinois with one dream...to play football for his beloved Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Unfortunately for Rudy this was essentially an impossible dream. He's much too small to play major college football and, as one character will point out, he possesses hardly a speck of athletic ability. And while he's not much of a football player Rudy isn't much of a student either. He doesn't have the grades to get into community college much less Notre Dame. But what Rudy does have is a seemingly limitless supply of heart and determination. He is going to play football at Notre Dame and nobody will ever convince him otherwise.As we follow Rudy's journey and see all the obstacles put up in his way it is almost unfathomable that he could ultimately succeed. But this is a movie about living the dream. The writer and director are never shy about tugging on the viewer's heartstrings as Rudy's story unfolds. They knew that in order for the movie to ultimately work those watching were going to have to fall in love with their main character. And sure enough, thanks in no small part to a wonderful performance from Sean Astin, Rudy is a character you embrace wholeheartedly. There are more than a few times during the film when you might find yourself with a lump in the throat. And then there's that final scene which, inevitable though it may be, packs such a tremendous emotional wallop. It's a scene which proves that yes it is OK for even the toughest of tough guys to shed a tear when watching a movie. Rare is the movie which makes you want to stand up and cheer even as you wipe the tears from your eyes. This is one of those movies. It may never make any of those lists of all-time greatest movies. But when you need a pick-me-up, when you need a little inspiration, maybe when you need to have a little bit of faith restored you can't do any better than to sit down and spend two hours in the company of this lovable underdog. All together now...RUDY! RUDY! RUDY!",9,0,1,13 November 2009
Major League," Doesn't quite make my heart sing
","Having first seen it many years ago when I recently watched Major League again I found that it did not live up to my memories. Nor did it live up to its reputation. It's not nearly as funny as I seemed to remember it being. And while it it has acquired a reputation for being truly outrageous that's not really an accurate assessment either. Honestly, the movie's kind of tame, it doesn't push the envelope nearly as much as you would think. Now all of this doesn't mean it's a bad movie. And any movie with Charlie Sheen playing a character nicknamed Wild Thing will have an outlandish moment or two. It's just that there aren't enough of those great moments to allow the movie to really be that brilliant, outrageous baseball comedy so many people remember it as being.The story is your typical sports underdog tale. A bunch of losers band together and prove that maybe they're not really losers after all. There's the requisite villain, in this case the team's evil female owner, who is trying to hold the team down. Obstacles are constantly thrown in the way of our plucky underdogs but they forge on towards the big game at the end which ends all movies of this sort. Along the way there are some laughs and hijinks. Not all the jokes and gags hit their mark but enough do to keep you entertained. There's an unfortunate romantic subplot which is a total dud. All the time spent exploring this relationship between the veteran catcher, played by Tom Berenger, and his old flame, played by Rene Russo, is really time wasted for the movie. We never really get to know Russo's character at all and Berenger's crusty old catcher is much more in his element around his teammates. You know the movie's going to try to pay this storyline off in the end but really who cares? This movie is about the Indians. And there were more than enough personalities in that group of misfits to carry the movie. Sheen, Berenger, Corbin Bernsen, Wesley Snipes, Chelcie Ross and, as the voodoo-loving Pedro Cerrano, Dennis Haysbert. Each of the characters has their moments. Perhaps the best performance of all though comes from James Gammon as the manager, Lou Brown. He gets many of the best lines and the way he delivers them is just perfect. And of course there's also Bob Uecker providing laughs every time he opens his mouth in playing the team's radio announcer. There are a lot of fine performers here and the movie has a lot of good pieces. But there's the sense it doesn't quite all add up. It's not as consistently funny as you'd hope. The whole thing is very predictable which wouldn't be so bad if the movie at least kept you laughing all the way to the ending you know is coming. But the laughs come and go, and when they do come they're generally not as explosive as you'd hope. And there's that romantic storyline which is a complete waste of time and which rears its ugly head again in the end at a time when all the focus clearly should be on the team. Major League is not a bad movie. But is has enough flaws to hold it back from true greatness.",6,1,2,10 May 2012
The Dark Knight," The legend of Ledger
","It's just a Batman movie right? A silly little comic book movie. Destined to be enjoyed but not taken particularly seriously. Wrong. So very, very wrong. The Dark Knight is the rare film which transcends its genre. You don't have to qualify things by saying it's a great comic book movie or a great summer popcorn movie. It's a great movie. Period. It may not be the best movie ever made as some overly enthusiastic fans may like you to believe. But it's in the ballpark. And for all that this fantastic film has going for it one thing stands out and that is the award-winning performance of the late Heath Ledger.Similarly to the Nicholson/Keaton dynamic of the 1989 film it is the actor playing The Joker who outshines the actor playing Batman. And as with the earlier film that is no knock on the actor portraying Batman, in this case Christian Bale. There is nothing bad to be said about Bale, it's just that Ledger's performance is simply stunning. He has created one of those iconic movie characters who will be remembered for all time. Darker, more sinister and infinitely more terrifying than Nicholson's Joker ever was Ledger's Joker grabs hold of this movie right at the start and never lets go. The terribly sad fact that Ledger passed away before the film was ever released probably only adds to the mystique and aura that will forever surround this character. Ledger's performance rightly goes down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest ever. Legendary.While Ledger may steal the show pretty much everything else about the film works perfectly. One iconic character does not make a great movie. Here everything which surrounds Ledger comes together to produce something truly wonderful. Bale's quiet, brooding portrayal of the film's hero may be overshadowed by the manic intensity of the film's villain but he plays Bruce Wayne and Batman the way they have to be played. A fine job even if it often seems his is the supporting role and Ledger's the lead rather than the other way around. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman all return from Batman Begins and fall back into their roles seamlessly. Katie Holmes has been replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal in the critical role of Rachel Dawes and that's certainly an improvement. If it was hard to take Holmes seriously as an assistant district attorney that is not a problem this time around as Gyllenhaal provides a much stronger portrayal. Aaron Eckhart portrays the district attorney Harvey Dent, a man who any fan of the Batman saga knows is destined to have a rather interesting journey in the course of the film. It's a rather complex character to portray and Eckhart, like pretty much everyone around him, is spot-on brilliant.So it's not just Ledger, the whole cast is terrific. And so is everything else. The film is wonderfully written and directed. The cinematography is breathtaking, with the IMAX sequences taking things to a whole other level. The music fits perfectly, adding to the tension with what is an always powerful and at times truly haunting score. The effects are fabulous yet you never get the sense they're overdone as everything seems real and believable. Two and a half hours and this film leaves you breathlessly wanting more. This is no ordinary comic book movie. It's a movie which will stand the test of time. Everyone involved with the film can rest easy with the knowledge that they have created something truly special.",9,4,9,12 February 2009
Annie Hall," Woody being Woody
","Woody Allen, for better or for worse, is always going to be Woody Allen. He carved out his niche in film history just by being himself. Annie Hall is a film which he wrote, directed and starred in. The character he plays is named Alvy Singer but let's be honest, it's Woody playing Woody with all that entails, all the quirks that are part of the Woody Allen package. Alvy's a neurotic, Jewish comedian who calls New York City home. New York is more than home really, it's a big part of who Alvy is, the only place he could ever be. Alvy insulates himself from the world, the woman he loves embraces it. That woman is of course Annie Hall. She's a quirky, ditzy aspiring singer. Eventually she will set her sights on California. California? Oh no, this is something Alvy is just not equipped to handle. So the relationship falls apart. But we already knew that because Alvy told us right at the beginning of the film that the relationship was already over. Allen plays with time throughout the film, jumping from the end to the middle to the beginning and back to the end again. Flashbacks to Alvy's childhood shed some light on what made this man the neurotic bundle of nerves he has become. Along the way there are plenty of laughs but some serious moments too. This is not just a slapstick farce, it's a movie that's got some real heart to it. You can't help but feel for poor Alvy Singer.Of course Alvy is not the easiest man to embrace so you certainly sympathize with Annie too. Loving Alvy Singer is quite a challenge. If anyone's up to the task it's the supremely flighty Annie. In playing the part Diane Keaton is the wonderful yin to Woody's yang. Opposites really do attract I guess. Keaton and Allen have wonderful chemistry, playing off one another beautifully. There are times when Annie is perhaps a little too much of a ditz to really take seriously but you remind yourself that this is after all a Woody Allen comedy. Seriousness is appreciated at times but certainly not always required. The film is not just one joke after another, in fact there are plenty of stretches with no jokes at all, times where the story is allowed to breathe. And simple though it may be it really is a very good story.Annie Hall is not a film to leave you doubled over with laughter. Oh sure, there are some truly hilarious moments. Alvy's skewering of some pretentious twit standing behind him in line at the movies is as good as comedy gets. Allen makes use of all kinds of comedic devices, paying no attention to the rules most Hollywood filmmakers adhere to. In a Woody Allen film there are no rules. He'll break the fourth wall, he'll use subtitles to reveal characters' thoughts, he'll even toss in an animation sequence. Anything goes. Not everything works perfectly but it all works well enough to make the end result very satisfying. There are so many little moments, throwaway lines which are unimportant in the grand scheme of things but which add great flavor to the comedic stew. The guy who forgot his mantra? Priceless. There is the sense that once the movie settles in it could use a few more laughs along the way. It never quite hits the heights of that movie line sequence from very early on in the film. But there is plenty here to embrace, not least the two great characters of Alvy Singer and Annie Hall, portrayed so wonderfully by Allen and Keaton. Two great performers creating two unique characters in a love story only Woody Allen could tell.",7,1,2,28 January 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," Slow, frustrating film that leads to...what exactly?
","This movie, hailed my many as an all-time classic, does have a lot going for it. It is beautifully photographed. The special effects were for its time revolutionary. And there is a truly fascinating story there to be told. Unfortunately it is in the storytelling that 2001 suffers. The film raises many questions, then spends over two hours not answering them. For much too much of that time absolutely nothing happens. But you stay with it because there seems to be the possibility of a great payoff at the end. Yet the ending frustrates just as much as all that came before it, perhaps more so. You may well find yourself saying 'I waited two hours for THAT? And what the heck was that anyway?' I do not believe a movie has to lay all the answers out for you. Some of the best films of all time are very much left open to your own interpretation. But the answers we are given here are so unsatisfying and ultimately confusing that we wonder why we went through the trouble of watching at all.Again this movie does have a lot going for it and it is easy to see why so many praise it. It certainly seems to be one of the most polarizing films of all time. Love it or hate it, there is no in between. While I would not recommend it I must say the movie sets up a fascinating premise. The opening sequence which takes place in prehistoric times goes on a tad too long but is rich with symbolism and intrigue and sets up well the themes of the movie. Many are fascinated by the evolution of man, the questions 'Why are we here?', 'How did we get here', and 'What exactly is it all about?' In this film, man sets off on a quest for answers to these questions. Unfortunately the answers don't satisfy. If it is answers you seek perhaps you should see the sequel 2010 which if nothing else sheds some light on what in the world the last twenty minutes or so of 2001 was all about. If you want to see the true genius of Kubrick then Dr. Strangelove or A Clockwork Orange will do quite nicely. Enjoy what is good about 2001....the beautiful photography, the special effects, the great and fascinating character of the computer HAL. But be forewarned that this long journey does not lead to a satisfying destination.",4,11,21,14 May 2005
Toy Story," The start of something big
","Nowadays people assume that when it comes to what they see up on the big screen computers make absolutely anything possible. If you can dream it you can see it with the assistance of a little computer wizardry. But of course that was not always the case. The computer animation revolution had to start somewhere and that somewhere was Toy Story. The animators at Pixar made the impossible possible. You watch the movie today and it's easy to take it for granted. You forget that Pixar was attempting something entirely new and that there were more than a few doubts as to whether it would work. Oh, it worked alright. It worked spectacularly. Director John Lasseter and his animation team created a visually stunning masterpiece the likes of which had never been seen before. Movie animation would never be the same, Toy Story changed everything.The movie looks great but in order to be deemed a success there had to be a story to match the visuals. All the technological wizardry in the world would not have been able to hide a lousy story. Thankfully that proved to be no concern as we get a compelling and endearing storyline, one which provides plenty of opportunities for some good laughs as well. For as revolutionary as the animation was it is the story and the characters which ultimately make the movie so beloved. To infinity and beyond! Just saying it brings a smile to your face. The toys which are the stars of this story are great, memorable characters. Each is infused with its own unique personality. You can dismiss no toy as 'just a toy'. Each toy has its own story, its own life. All the voice actors deserve great credit for the work they did in making each toy stand out in its own way. Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear are of course the big stars and they both fit their roles perfectly. But whether playing a dog, a pig or a potato head each voice actor was uniformly terrific. R. Lee Ermey as a little green army man and Wallace Shawn as a Tyrannosaurus with serious anxiety issues are two personal favorites. So many characters which are so easy to embrace and each of whom is good for some laughs too. And there's even room for a great villain in Sid, the evil toy-destroying kid next door. A great cast of characters brought brilliantly to life by the great work of the animators and the voice cast.Toy Story triumphs in making you feel for its characters. Who can't empathize with Woody as he fears being pushed aside by Buzz? Who hasn't had insecurities like Rex? Who can't understand Mr. Potato Head's longing for a Mrs. Potato Head? When the toys hurt you hurt, when they triumph you feel as if you shared in it. It's a movie guaranteed to put a smile on your face. If there's any complaint it might be that the movie, at a trim 80 minutes, isn't long enough. We want to spend more time with these toys. Of course we would get the opportunity to do so in sequels to come. But the original movie certainly stands on its own merits. It's a movie you can happily watch again and again. And when you do take the time to really look at the world the animation team created for these toys to inhabit. The level of detail in the backgrounds is just as stunning as the beautifully rendered main characters. No corners were cut in creating a world which looks truly lived in. A whole world magically brought to life. Toy Story was, in its time, unlike anything anyone had ever seen. And all these years later the magic is still there. It's a movie which will be discovered, and loved, by generations to come.",8,0,0,8 September 2010
Blood Diamond," Often bleak but certainly compelling
","With its brutally honest look at the harsh realities of life in war-torn Sierra Leone, Blood Diamond can at times be a hard movie to sit through. But there is no denying the fact that the story told here is very powerful and compelling. With atrocities occurring all around this film certainly has its share of painful, depressing moments. But the story is so good, and that story is performed so well by a fine cast, that the film is well worth your while.The film is set in 1999, when Sierra Leone was in the midst of a brutal civil war. In the midst of this war, the big business of illegally exporting diamonds out of the war zone carries on. Our story here mainly focuses on two men caught up in this illicit, and often deadly, business. Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a loving husband and father living a relatively simple, peaceful life as a fisherman. That peaceful life is shattered when rebels come to his village, take his family away and put him to work searching for diamonds. The other key character, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is Danny Archer, a 'soldier of fortune' as he describes himself who makes his living smuggling diamonds out of Africa. These two men's paths will cross in jail, Archer there after one of his smuggling efforts goes awry, Solomon having been rounded up in a government raid on the rebels' diamond mining operation. While in jail, Archer learns that Solomon has a secret. Just before being hauled off to jail Solomon had found, and proceeded to bury, a huge diamond of immense value. When the two men are released form jail, they form an uneasy alliance. Solomon will lead Archer to the diamond, Archer will help Solomon find his family. These mens' respective quests, and their very different motivations, will drive the film.While the story certainly is a strong one the film does tend to drag at times. A few scenes left on the cutting room floor probably would have helped matters. There are some 'action' moments sprinkled throughout but it's certainly not an action film. It's well-done compelling human drama. Hounsou is terrific in his role, brilliantly bringing the strong, powerful, determined Solomon to life. DiCaprio is also very good, although in a minor quibble, he never does seem entirely comfortable with the accent. Jennifer Connelly has a smaller role as one of those idealistic investigative reporters who always seem to turn up in movies like this. Her character in many ways is very clichéd but Connelly does a good job with what she has to work with. All in all this film may fall just short of being labeled great but it is certainly very good and well worth seeing.",7,1,2,26 October 2007
Men in Black," J and K, the great comic duo
","Tommy Lee Jones is Agent K, a man who takes his work very seriously. He's all business, possessing no sense of humor that he is aware of. Will Smith is K's new partner Agent J. J is the flashy, showy type. Young, cool and hip, everything K is not. They are the Men in Black, part of a top-secret organization which monitors alien activity on Earth. Turns out aliens have been living among us, peacefully for the most part, for years. The Men in Black keep the alien presence under wraps. Everything is going along just fine until a Bug shows up. Now the Earth is set up for imminent destruction. Only J and K can save us. And if while saving us they can make us laugh all the better.J and K, Smith and Jones, are a terrific comic duo. They play off one another beautifully with absolutely wonderful chemistry. The obvious contrast between the buttoned-down K and the exuberant J provides plenty of comic gold. Both actors suit their parts perfectly, Smith the showman and Jones the straight man. With his wry, dry wit the supposedly unfunny K is actually one of the funniest characters you'll see. And J, new as he is to the whole aliens among us thing, provides plenty of laughs as he tries to come to grips with what the heck is actually going on. Smith and Jones are obviously the stars of the show. But they are ably supported by the likes of Rip Torn and Linda Fiorentino as well as Vincent D'Onofrio who does very well with a clearly challenging role, that of the villainous Bug who certainly doesn't blend in as seamlessly as all the other aliens populating Manhattan. It's a movie which has a great look to it, the whole menagerie of aliens look terrific, the visual effects are seamless. The story moves along well with plenty of laughs throughout. It's a movie which knows better than to take itself seriously. It's an unabashed parody and a very good one, with the great comic duo of Smith and Jones working ever so well together to put the whole thing over the top. Popcorn flick that it is Men in Black may not make many lists of the greatest movies ever. But it's hard to imagine you can watch this movie and not come away with a smile on your face.",7,1,2,17 April 2011
The Graduate," And here's to you...
","The Graduate is a film which has so much going for it. It's wonderfully written...witty when it has to be, smart throughout. It's beautifully photographed with director Mike Nichols framing so many scenes in the perfect manner to best tell his story. It's a film with some wonderful acting performances, most notably by the two leads, Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, with Bancroft creating one of the most memorable characters in film history. Yes indeed, here's to you Mrs. Robinson. It's a film set in a very specific time and place, late 1960s upper middle class Californian suburbia. The values of that time and place are so very important to the story yet the film still holds up wonderfully four decades later.As the film opens we meet young Benjamin Braddock, played by Hoffman, who has just graduated college and is now returning home to figure out what he wants to do with his life. He'd like a little time to think about his future but his family, and pretty much everyone else around him, has other ideas. They want to know what this bright young man is going to do with himself and they want to know now. Feeling rather trapped by everyone else's expectations of what he should be Benjamin rebels in a rather unique way...having an affair with the wife of his father's business partner. Seems Mrs. Robinson is feeling a little trapped in her life as well. So the two engage in a summer-long affair. But to call this a romance would be inaccurate. These two barely speak to one another, there's no emotion involved. This is a purely physical relationship. But eventually there will be a dramatic turn. Pretty much forced into it by his parents Benjamin very reluctantly takes Mrs. Robinson's daughter on a date. Suffice to say Mrs. Robinson does not approve. When Benjamin comes to realize he'd much rather be with the daughter than the mother emotions boil over and the film begins to move in an all new direction, building to a classic conclusion.The Graduate is not a perfect film. It takes a little while to really get going as we establish just who Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson are and what drives them to have their affair. It's certainly important to learn about these characters' motivations but it is not until the affair actually begins that the story really takes off. And what a fascinating story it is and it's performed brilliantly. In his first major film role Hoffman seems rather awkward at times, especially in the film's beginning. But his awkwardness fits the character perfectly especially in the initial seduction scene where Benjamin is quite obviously way out of his league. But who wouldn't be out of his league when faced with Mrs. Robinson? Bancroft does a wonderful job of bringing this very unique character to life, hitting all the right emotional notes throughout. And there are certainly plenty of different emotions on display. While Hoffman and Bancroft carry the film there are other important performances as well, most notably by Katharine Ross in the pivotal role of Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine. Ross doesn't have nearly the screen time of the two leads. In fact for a character so important to the story we barely get to know Elaine at all which is a minor quibble with the film. But Ross makes the best of what she has to work with, one moment in particular standing out as she does a split-second emotional 180, instantly going from giddy happiness to something else entirely. Well done.The Graduate is a great film. The story is captivating and the actors have done a marvelous job with it. The Simon and Garfunkel songs which provide the soundtrack are a terrific addition to the film as they fit in perfectly with what is happening on the screen. All in all this is a film to be treasured and enjoyed again and again.",8,0,0,15 February 2008
Singin' in the Rain," A great movie that's great fun
","There are plenty of movies which may be a lot of fun but aren't really great movies. Singin' in the Rain is a great movie. And great fun. It is one of the most iconic movies ever and deservedly so. Even people who have never seen the whole movie know Gene Kelly splashing about in the rain. But this is a movie which is so much more than that one legendary musical number. For starters there are plenty of other musical numbers which are just as good as, or perhaps depending on your tastes, even better than Kelly's famous nighttime twirl through the rainy streets. But what makes the movie truly great is that it does not have to rely solely on the big song-and-dance numbers. This is a movie with a great story. So many musicals are just biding their time between songs. Not this one. There are actually compelling things going on between the songs. And funny things too. Add it all up and this is absolutely fabulous entertainment.It's Kelly everyone remembers most but great credit must also go to his co-stars Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds. The three of them make such a great team, their Good Morning number is as good as it gets, just as much of a highlight as the title song. We know what a legendary dancer Kelly is but O'Connor and Reynolds more than hold their own. O'Connor even gets a showcase of his own with Make 'Em Laugh, a number which is as much acrobatics as dance. Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds are all terrific in their singing, their dancing and their acting. And yet perhaps the best performance is turned in by Jean Hagen. And Hagen doesn't do any singing or dancing at all. And that's the point. Hagen, a wonderfully talented actress, is playing a completely terrible actress who can't sing, can't dance, can't even talk. It takes a great actress to pull that off and Hagen absolutely nails it.The story takes place in Hollywood at the dawn of the talking pictures era. Kelly and Hagen play Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, the most famous and popular screen couple of the time. But they are silent film stars, the transition to talkies will be quite painful. The biggest problem is Lina's voice which is indescribably bad, grating to the extreme. The movie has plenty of fun at her expense and milks lots of laughs out of the overall struggle of those working in film at the time to come to grips with this newfangled sound technology. How can Don Lockwood go forward in this new era if he's attached to the talentless dim-bulb Lina? Enter, thanks to a rather ingenious suggestion from Don's friend Cosmo Brown, young Kathy Selden. Kathy's got the talent and the charm Lina lacks and Reynolds plays the part of the wide-eyed girl caught up in the crazy world of Hollywood so beautifully. Don and Kathy could be a great pairing, on and off screen...if only Lina could be nudged out of the way.There is a story here full of comic possibilities and the movie takes full advantage of it. O'Connor's character of Cosmo has a few clownish moments but nothing too far over-the top. No need for a lot of slapstick silliness. The movie's more subtle than that. Smarter too. And whereas many musicals struggle to weave the songs into the story everything fits together wonderfully here. The only real misstep comes near the end with a huge production number which unfortunately sticks out like a sore thumb. In addition to going on for far too long it is quite disconnected from the plot. It really seems like an indulgence for co-director Kelly. There was nobody who could tell him it didn't belong. It's performed very well, it just is out of place. And it stops the movie's momentum just as it should be building to a big finish. It's one musical number too far. But that should not detract from what is all in all a brilliantly conceived and performed movie. It may have slowed down a touch at the end but it still has its big finish, and a thoroughly satisfying finish at that. Such a fun, enjoyable, charming movie. Great entertainment. What a glorious feeling indeed.",8,1,2,26 November 2012
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Hold these memories dear
","Jim Carrey plays shy, buttoned-down Joel. Kate Winslet plays outgoing free spirit Clementine. Opposites do attract so when Joel and Clementine meet they fall for one another right away. But unbeknownst to them they've done this before. They met, fell in love, had a two-year relationship. They don't know any of this because each has had the other erased from their mind. Yes, there's a company, Lacuna, that can do such a thing, erasing any memories you don't want anymore. And with that this movie is off, spinning some wild and crazy circles as it travels through time and through Joel's mind.After the initial setup we go back in time a bit to the point where Joel, much to his dismay, realizes Clementine has erased him. He decides to do the same to her and here things get delightfully trippy. Most of the rest of the film takes place inside Joel's head as he undergoes the erasure procedure. As the Lacuna technicians do their thing there is a major complication. Joel changes his mind. He wants to call it off, wants to hold onto his memories of Clem. Unfortunately while undergoing the procedure the subject is quite unconscious so Joel has no way of communicating this. Inside his own head he struggles to hold onto Clem. Clem is right there with him inside his head to help. The pair of one-time lovers tries to find places for themselves inside hidden corners of Joel's mind. The Lacuna techs realize something is amiss and redouble their efforts to zap Clementine right out of Joel's head. The head of the company is called in to personally oversee the procedure. If possible the movie's story gets even more tangled. This movie definitely is not short on twists.It all sounds very confusing but it's really not. A complicated story to be sure but as it is presented here a story that is easy to follow. And it's a story you can't help but embrace, as charming as it is captivating. Through all the ups and downs, all the twists and turns, you root so hard for Joel and Clem. You desperately want to see them together. Carrey and Winslet perform their respective parts so wonderfully. Carrey is a revelation with none of the outlandish look-at-me stuff he's known for. His character is grounded and he turns in a suitably grounded performance. Carrey's the straight man, it's Winslet who gets to be delightfully kooky. Winslet brings great energy, great personality and great hair to the character of Clem. The two stars are ably supported by the actors playing the Lacuna staff. Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson each bring something unique to the film. Initially it seems they are all unimportant bit players, that the movie is all about Joel and Clem, with Carrey and Winslet having the only important parts to play. But the movie weaves the Lacuna bunch into the story very smartly. It's a brilliantly constructed story from writer Charlie Kaufman, who specializes in these wonderful mindbenders. Director Michel Gondry brings Kaufman's story to life perfectly. The result is a movie which is both very entertaining and incredibly charming. This is a wonderfully unique movie which you will always want to hold in your memory.",9,0,1,10 July 2013
Once Upon a Time in America," It takes a long time to tell this story
","Yes, the film is too long. No, the film should not have been cut down and butchered beyond all recognition as was the case with its original American theatrical release. Somewhere in between there must be a happy medium. But given the choice between the two extremes it is certainly much better that we are able to see the film as director Sergio Leone intended for it to be seen. Leone's vision for how the story should unfold is what makes the film unique. At times it can be a frustrating film to watch with its exceptionally deliberate pacing. There are certainly times while watching the film where you wish Leone would pick up the pace and move things along. But upon reflection, after seeing the whole film in its entirety, only then can you really appreciate what Leone has done. It's a terrific story and it's a story which is told in a simply brilliant manner. Yes, the film drags at times. Yes, there certainly could have been some cuts here and there to make the running time more manageable. But in the end there is no denying that the film works. It's by no means perfect. There are notable lulls and lesser moments scattered throughout. But the film as a whole ends up being greater than the sum of its parts. And you really cannot understand that until you settle in for the long journey and watch the whole thing.The film tells the story of a group of five young Jewish gangsters from New York City over a span of five decades or so. As you might imagine these characters lead violent lives and certainly not all of them are destined to survive this decades-long journey. But the way this story is presented we know the ultimate fates of some of these characters very early on in the film. That is because Leone presents his story in a non-linear fashion, cutting back and forth between three distinct eras. It is left to the audience, and one key character, to piece things together and it is really impossible to do so until the story has completely unfolded. Scenes which seem unimportant and superfluous take on an entirely different meaning when you see where the story eventually goes. Robert De Niro plays Noodles (because what's a gangster without a nickname?) and it is Noodles who is at the center of the film, tying the various eras together. A younger actor portrays the character in the film's earliest 1920s era when the gangsters are really just young boys. De Niro takes over the role for the other two eras, during the gangsters' 1930s prime and in 1968 when Noodles is pulled back into a world he thought he had left decades ago. De Niro owns the screen, his performance is perfect as he portrays the young 1930s tough and the older man of 1968 trying to unravel a very complex personal mystery. And De Niro is supported by a large group of excellent actors who bring each of the story's eras to brilliant life. James Woods as Noodles' closest friend in the gang and Elizabeth McGovern as the woman Noodles loves but is probably never destined to have give the two most notable performances aside from De Niro but really the entire cast is spot-on. From the young child actors portraying the gang in its earliest incarnation to Woods and McGovern and many other familiar faces who pop up throughout everyone involved seems to fit their role perfectly. It's a wonderful cast which does a magnificent job bringing a terrific story to life.So yes this is a film with a great story. And yes the cast is terrific. And yes the way Leone frames his story adds a brilliant touch. But there is the still the nagging thought that a little brisker pace would have helped. It's not even that entire scenes had to be cut as you realize in the end that every scene really does have its place. Its that Leone at times seems to linger on scenes where the important information the audience and characters need has already been relayed. And there are scenes where too much time is spent setting up the important event which is about to happen rather than simply getting to that important event. A few minor cuts here and there might well have lessened the frustration one senses as the film hits the occasional lull. It's a film with so many great moments but you wish Leone could have gotten in and out of those great moments a little quicker. But all in all this is a film which is certainly a long journey but definitely a satisfying one.",7,0,1,30 September 2008
Taken," Taken on an exciting ride
","It is what it is. A shoot-em-up action thriller. Story? What story? More shootings please. And throw in some big explosions too. You know what you're getting into with a movie of this genre. Movies such as these are never destined to be remembered as as any kind of classic cinema but if done right they can be thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. And Taken is done right. Helped immeasurably by the strong performance of Liam Neeson in the starring role the movie is able to deliver exactly what it promised it would. Clocking in at just over 90 minutes it's a tight, well-paced thrill ride. You get plenty of great action and really that's all you're looking for out of a movie such as this.Neeson plays recently retired CIA agent Bryan Mills who has settled in southern California to be close to his teenage daughter Kim who is now living with her mother and wealthy stepfather after her parents' divorce. The movie starts a little slowly as we set up the family dynamics but things pick up in a hurry. Bryan reluctantly agrees to allow Kim and a friend to go to Paris. Upon arriving in France it takes the girls approximately fifteen minutes (give or take) to get themselves kidnapped, destined to be sold into sex slavery. Luckily for Kim her daddy dearest has a very particular set of skills. Those skills will be put to the test as the clock starts ticking and Bryan faces a race against time to save his daughter.And so Bryan arrives in Paris where he becomes a one man wrecking crew. The dead bodies start piling up. He really is making quite a mess. But nothing will stand in his way. As focused as a laser beam he will do whatever is necessary to bring his little girl home. As in all movies of this sort our hero is helped by the fact the bad guys are really stupid. And really, really bad shots. Apparently these guys haven't put in much time at the shooting range. At times it all does get a bit silly as our lone ranger dispatches villain after villain, extricating himself from any sticky situation with the greatest of ease. But you really only notice that if you stop and think about it. Don't think. Just watch and enjoy. Take the movie for what it is. It's exciting, it's entertaining. It is exactly what you would want a movie of this genre to be. Full credit to Neeson, upon whose shoulders the movie almost entirely rests. His performance is superb. He's a great hero who you identify with and root for all the way. It's a simple story, one man determined to save one girl. Neeson carries that story so well. If only all the other girls who were taken had a father like Bryan Mills.",7,0,0,23 July 2010
Toy Story 2," The grand toy adventure
","The original Toy Story played out mostly in Andy's room and his neighbor's house. It was a great story but one that felt a little confined, quick excursion to Pizza Planet notwithstanding. Toy Story 2 opens up the toy world, providing room for a great, grand adventure. This story can go anywhere and that creates opportunity for great visuals, great laughs and great, big action. Big action in an animated movie about toys? Yes indeed. What happens when a group of toys tries to cross the road? Mayhem. Beautiful, hilarious mayhem.All our favorite toys from the first movie are back for Toy Story 2. This time the story focuses largely on Woody, who discovers that he is a prized collectible, the star of an old, popular TV puppet show. He finds that he is actually part of a set of toys. There's Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl, Stinky Pete the Prospector and Bullseye, Woody's horse. This is all very exciting for Woody. Or it would be if not for how it is he came to discover all this about himself. Woody was kidnapped by greedy toy collector Al who plans to sell Woody and the rest of his gang to a toy museum in Japan. How can Woody get back to Andy? Well, duh. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Buzz leads a daring, perilous crosstown rescue mission. There will be many obstacles along the way. And the biggest foe for Buzz Lightyear will be...Buzz Lightyear! What a twisted, funny toy world we live in.If there is any complaint at all with Toy Story 2 it would be that Woody and Buzz are largely kept apart. The chemistry and interplay between these two characters gave the first movie much of its charm and there's a sense this movie misses that a little bit. But there are more than enough good things here to make the sequel a clear success. First off, the film looks spectacular. For as great an achievement in animation as the first Toy Story was the sequel takes it to another level. There are some truly breathtaking visuals here. The story is compelling, with plenty of room for both humor and drama. And some real poignancy too. All the voice actors do a great job bringing their toys to life. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are the big stars but every performer plays his or her part perfectly. All the old favorites from the first movie are back and there are some great new additions too. Joan Cusack is a wildly enthusiastic Jessie. Jodi Benson provides plenty of laughs in playing Barbie. Stinky Pete seems to have a lot of Sideshow Bob in him. And there is room for a human or two in this toy world, Wayne Knight as Al the Toy Collector making for a great villain. Kids will surely love the movie but adults will too. Plenty of sly references and lots of subtle humor that may have the parents chuckling while their children wonder what's so funny. All in all Toy Story 2 is the rare sequel which does not disappoint, a clearly worthy successor to the original movie which was so beloved.",8,0,1,26 February 2011
The Artist," The sweet sound of silence
","Kudos to director Michel Hazanavicius. He had the audacious idea to make a black-and-white silent film more than eighty years after movies had begun to talk. And then he executed that idea brilliantly. The film had the potential to be a cheap, if interesting gimmick. It proved to be so much more than that. It proved to be a great film. The fact it was so unique only added to its allure. Helped by a terrific cast Hazanavicius produced true movie magic.There are so many ingenious things about The Artist but the smartest thing the film has going for it is its subject matter. It's a silent film about silent films. And that opens up so many delicious possibilities. The film's star, Jean Dujardin in a truly mesmerizing performance, is playing silent film star George Valentin. Valentin is on top of his game and on top of the world. The biggest star of his era, adored by legions of fans. One of his biggest fans is a young woman, Peppy Miller, who audaciously sneaks in a kiss with him outside the premiere of Valentin's latest smash hit. Little do either of them know then that they are two ships passing in the night. The silent movie era is about to end. George Valentin is on the way to ruin. Peppy Miller is on the way to stardom.Peppy starts out as an anonymous extra on one of Valentin's films. From there her star slowly rises. Meanwhile his star burns out completely. The world forgets George Valentin. But Peppy does not. She remembers that man she once so admired. They had but a brief connection but it meant the world to a young woman just getting her start in the business. If anyone can save George Valentin it is Peppy. With a little help from George's wonderfully cute four-legged friend Jack the dog.All of this is told so wonderfully and, to modern eyes and ears, so uniquely. Producing this particular story as a silent film was simply ingenious. It's both a love letter to old-time Hollywood and a thoroughly modern film. The film has so many nods to that long-gone era but still works so well for a modern audience. When characters in this film dismiss silent stars as just mugging for the camera it reinforces the point that this film's stars are not doing that. Yes, it's a silent film but unlike any we have ever seen before. And yet with enough of those old silent movie touches to make it a worthy homage. A very delicate balance was required and Hazanavicius created that balance perfectly. Of course it never could have worked without the right cast. What a challenge these performers had, doing something quite unlike anything they had done before. And they all nailed it. Dujardin was simply amazing. Bérénice Bejo, playing Peppy, matched him stride for stride. What a delightful pair they prove to be. James Cromwell gives such a heartfelt performance as Valentin's loyal chauffeur. And as head of Valentin's film studio John Goodman manages to be a loud presence even in complete silence, he's simply perfect for his role. Helped along all the way by a wonderful old-time sounding silent movie score the film gives you comedy, drama, romance. And often does it in ways only a silent movie can, Hazanavicius taking full advantage of his medium. Intertitles are used sparingly but to great effect, most notably in the film's most dramatic moment which so cleverly becomes the film's funniest moment. That great silent movie moment serves as a reminder of what films can be with a little imagination. Hazanavicius had the imagination. And he had the talent to bring his vision to life. It all adds up to a wonderfully unique, incredibly entertaining and supremely charming film.",8,4,6,21 April 2013
National Treasure," Overly long, often ludicrous, but still reasonably fun
","Please don't take this movie seriously. If you do so it will prove impossible to enjoy it. The whole thing is implausible, impossible, utterly ridiculous. But having said that, it's not all that bad actually. No, you cannot steal the Declaration of Independence. And if you somehow do, you certainly can't constantly be rolling and unrolling it like some old Farrah Fawcett poster you used to have on your wall as you take it out of its handy carrying tube. Squirting lemon juice on it and blowing on it with a hair dryer would probably not be good ideas either. But try not to think about these things. Thinking is not recommended as you watch this movie. Just turn off your brain, enjoy it as best you can, and when it's over you can look back and say, 'well that was all rather silly wasn't it?'Anyhow our rather silly yet reasonably engrossing plot follows treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates, as played by Nicolas Cage. Gates comes to believe that clues to the location of a treasure of unimaginable wealth are written in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Well that makes perfect sense now doesn't it? Gates decides he must steal the Declaration before the bad guys get to it. Oy, there's always gotta be bad guys. Anyhow, with the help of National Archivist (and requisite love interest because we must have a love interest...its a rule or something) Abigail Chase, played by Diane Kruger, Gates stays one step ahead of the requisite bad guys and deciphers clue after clue which inevitably lead to...more clues. The movie starts to drag and you get the sense a good half hour or so could have been cut out and nobody would have missed it.In the two lead roles Cage and Kruger do pretty well with the material they have to work with. So much of the movie is impossibly silly but they more or less make it work. Playing the role of the requisite comic sidekick Justin Bartha unfortunately fails to be the least bit funny. In fact you'll find that when the movie tries to be funny it is desperately unfunny but in what are meant to be serious moments you may find yourself trying to stifle a giggle. That's not good. Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight float in and out but don't make much of an impression. But I'm sure they collected nice paychecks.The whole thing is so formulaic...you have seen this movie before and you have seen it done a lot better. Indiana Jones anyone? But it is what it is and it's not all bad. You'll probably wish it was shorter. You'll probably wish it was funnier. You'll probably wish it was at least remotely plausible. But all things considered, despite all its flaws, it's reasonably fun. You could do a lot worse.",6,1,1,15 November 2006
Reservoir Dogs," Good, but missing a certain something
","Reservoir Dogs has a lot going for it. There's a fabulous cast, a smart and witty script and a circular time line which allows for fascinating twists and turns which would not have been possible were the story told in the traditional manner, from beginning to end. But the film lacks a certain energy pushing it forward. Too often it seems we're going in circles and not really getting anywhere. It's also an unusual film in that instead of seeing the key events we only see conversations in which the characters discuss the key events. It adds a certain air of mystery but the resulting effect is too much talking, not enough doing.The movie revolves around a spectacularly botched diamond heist. As the script bounces back and forth in time we see the planning leading up to the attempted robbery and the bloody aftermath. Bloody is a key word as this movie is drenched in seemingly gallons of blood throughout. Much of the focus of the film is in watching the gang of crooks try to piece together exactly what went wrong. The performances are all terrific. Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth all bring something unique in their respective performances as members of the gang. Lawrence Tierney, for whom the adjective 'crusty' may have been invented, is quite a presence as Joe Cabot, the man responsible for putting the gang together. And Chris Penn does fine work as Nice Guy Eddie, Joe's son who tries to sort out the mess the robbery has become. It's a stellar collection of actors but unfortunately, other than the wonderfully deranged performance turned in by Madsen, they don't have much to do. They just stand around and talk. And talk, and talk, and talk some more. It's a compelling story, and the unique way in which it is told heightens the drama. But in the end, the payoff is not as great as might have been hoped. Reservoir Dogs is certainly a good film, but greatness eludes it.",7,0,1,29 August 2005
Eyes Wide Shut," A long, strange trip
","Stanley Kubrick's last film, a mere twelve years after his previous one. Bringing Eyes Wide Shut to the screen was a long, strange trip for Kubrick. The idea had been floating around inside his head for many, many years. So much preparation went into it. When shooting finally began it seemed as if it would never end, the noted perfectionist director presiding over one of the longest film shoots ever. And after all of this what was the one thing Kubrick needed most of all? More time. The first cut he produced surely would not have been the end product. The noted tinkerer would have surely been tweaking his film right up to its release date. But death robbed him of that opportunity. And left his final film a bit messy. With some clear, rather easy fixes Eyes Wide Shut could have been a real success. But Kubrick wasn't around to patch it together. And the result is a film which is a bit of a letdown.Eyes Wide Shut is often labeled an erotic thriller. It's a label which doesn't fit. There's nothing particularly erotic about it. Unfortunately not much thrilling either. It's a story of Dr. Bill Harford's journey into a bizarre sexual underground, a world in which he clearly does not belong. What does Bill hope to find? He's sent careening along this path by the revelation that his wife fantasized about cheating on him. Just thought about it, she didn't actually do anything. And this throws Bill completely for a loop. Which strains credulity a bit as you would think the seemingly grounded doctor should be able to handle this revelation which isn't much of a revelation at all. Instead he goes out looking for...something. He doesn't really know what. What he finds himself caught up in is not at all what he bargained for.There's a sense of mystery to Bill's journey, especially once he stumbles his way inside a bizarre sexual cult. Yes, it's that scene, the scene which got all the attention when the movie was released. The infinitely bizarre, mysterious orgy scene. What the heck is going on here? Who are these people? And what price will Bill pay for his intrusion? The tension in this sequence is thick. But ultimately, much like the movie as a whole, it fizzles out with a very anticlimactic feel. There are more mysteries and possible conspiracies to come but by this point in the movie we'd really like Kubrick to make some sense of all of this. And he never really manages to do so satisfactorily. The movie is very slowly paced. A long, at times laborious, trip. And the ending falls rather flat. With more time to work on the film Kubrick may well have been able to tighten things up. The ending was never really going to work but if he got to that ending in a different way, with a little more energy driving the film forward, the overall experience would have been much improved. As it is there are enough good things here to remind you why Kubrick was so revered but his final film falls disappointingly short of greatness.Getting this film made was a long, hard journey for Kubrick. And for his stars. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman put a lot into this movie. Cruise is to be commended, his portrayal of Bill is quite good. In playing Bill's wife Kidman hams it up a bit, especially in early scenes where she's drunk or stoned. But she has some good moments too before her character essentially gets out of the way and cedes the stage to Cruise's Bill and his strange journey of discovery. Cruise is really left to carry the film largely by himself, the story belongs to his character. The character doesn't always convince, Bill does some things which quite frankly it is very hard to see a man in his position doing. But Cruise does convince, you buy him as the character even as you question many of the things the character is doing. Kidman is OK with what little she is given to do, Sydney Pollack makes a good impression in a supporting role, but the film really is Cruise's. And Kubrick's of course. The great director's swan song is not exactly what you, or probably he, would have hoped. The story of the making of Eyes Wide Shut was a long, strange one. The movie itself is ultimately a long, strange one. It has its moments but it never quite all comes together.",6,1,2,12 May 2011
Some Like It Hot," Maybe not the greatest ever but still quite good
","Some Like It Hot is often hailed as the greatest comedy film of all time. That's probably a stretch. It may not be the greatest ever but it's still very good and thoroughly enjoyable. Driven by the outstanding performances of three top-notch stars in Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and the one and only Marilyn Monroe, Some Like It Hot will make you smile, make you laugh and maybe even make you cry but only because you're laughing so hard at times. If you go in expecting the greatest movie ever, you may end up being a touch disappointed. If you go in with more reasonable expectations you can't help but enjoy this delightful screwball comedy.The setup of this film's plot almost guarantees comic gold and sure enough it pays off. Curtis and Lemmon play Joe and Jerry, two musicians in Prohibition-era Chicago who witness a mob hit and have to get the heck out of town before they end up dead. They end up donning dresses, posing as women and joining an all-girl orchestra headed for Florida. Reborn, so to speak, as Josephine and Daphne the pair plan to ditch the band and resume their normal, non-dress wearing, lives as soon as they hit Florida. But on their new orchestra's train ride to the Sunshine State there is a complication. That complication comes in the shape (and oh what a shape!) of singer/ukulele player Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, played by the incomparable Monroe. Needless to say our two men find themselves very much attracted to the bubbly, beautiful Sugar. Of course the fact that they are 'women' very much complicates things. Hilarity ensues.Once the orchestra hits Florida this film really takes off. Joe, or Josephine if you prefer, decides he and Jerry/Daphne should stick around for a while. Taking a break from being disguised as a woman, and now posing as a Shell Oil millionaire, Joe tries to woo Sugar. Meanwhile an actual millionaire falls for 'Daphne' which obviously causes all kinds of complications for Jerry. Much of what ensues is simply priceless. There are a few jokes and gags which fall flat but there is so much here that works you forgive the film for the moments which don't quite measure up. And given the rather juvenile nature of so many modern comedies the more subtle nature of the comedy here is a blessed relief. This movie presents a truly ridiculous situation but it's never over the top. Director Billy Wilder found just the right tone to make the film work and the truly remarkable cast brings the story to life. There are some terrific supporting performances but it is the big three of Monroe, Curtis and Lemmon who really make this film work. What can you say about Marilyn Monroe that hasn't already been said? She simply owns the screen. Watch her perform the song 'I Wanna Be Loved by You' and I dare you not to fall in love. If this film has a straight man, Curtis is it. He's suave, reserved, and altogether perfect no matter which disguise he happens to be in at any given moment. But in this film it may be Lemmon who shines most of all. He pours his heart and soul into being 'Daphne' and it is an absolute treat to watch. Curtis and Monroe are both terrific and certainly have their share of moments and witty one-liners but the best moments and best lines seem to be reserved for Lemmon. It's obvious Lemmon had a lot of fun making this film. You'll have a lot of fun watching it. So what if it's not the 'best comedy ever'? It's a wonderfully written, brilliantly performed, incredibly enjoyable film. That's more than enough to make it well worth your while.",7,7,13,13 November 2007
The Da Vinci Code," A tremendous opportunity wasted
","When reading Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code one could not wait to turn the page to see what would happen next. When watching Ron Howard's film adaptation you might very well feel that you can not wait for it to simply be over. The tremendous story of the novel was full of energy, zest and excitement. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman has taken that story and almost impossibly sucked all the life right out of it. Everyone knows that in any film adaptation of a novel things are going to be changed. It's the nature of the beast. Characters and plot points are going to be tweaked and changed somewhat. But Goldsman does not give us minor tweaks, he changes the very story itself. Why anyone would feel the need to so drastically change the most basic and important plot elements of one of the most popular stories of all time is beyond comprehension. With the absolutely engrossing story they had to work with from the novel this film should have been something truly special. It is not. Somehow Akiva Goldsman managed to make The Da Vinci Code downright boring. And for anyone who read the novel incredibly frustrating.There are almost too many ridiculous changes from the novel to mention but the most obvious, and incredibly dumb, change is the fact that the central figure of the story, Harvard professor, symbologist and author Robert Langdon has been turned into a skeptic, someone who does not believe the very story on which the entire novel was based. The first time you hear Tom Hanks as Langdon describe the Holy Grail story as a 'myth' you know this film is going to have problems. The only reason Langdon ever became involved in the story in the novel was BECAUSE he knew, certainly believed and even wrote about the Holy Grail story. That is why a dying Jacques Sauniere's last act was to ensure that Langdon would be involved in all the events that would follow. If Langdon did not believe in the Grail he would have never been involved in the story at all.Turning Langdon into a skeptic makes absolutely no sense but that's only the start. Goldsman has changed the motivations behind many of the characters' actions and in doing so has changed the very essence of the characters themselves, and not for the better. Bishop Aringarosa who in the novel was horrified at the thought of any killing has now become almost downright sinister. Police Captain Bezu Fache certainly had his reasons to be adamant about Langdon's guilt in the novel. Here he has an entirely different reason to be sure of Langdon's guilt. An entirely ridiculous, implausible reason. The character of Jacques Sauniere is someone entirely different from who he was in the novel and the change in his character helps to destroy all the emotion the novel had, which came almost entirely from Sophie Neveu's quest to learn the truth about her family. Suffice to say Akiva Goldsman's truth does not match Dan Brown's. You'll much prefer Dan Brown's.Somewhere in this film Dan Brown's terrific story is still there. Maybe it's only there as a rough outline for Akiva Goldsman to follow (and ruin) but what's left of that engrossing, fascinating story is pretty much all this film has going for it. The acting by the two leads, Hanks as Langdon and Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, is forced, wooden and completely devoid of any emotion. There is absolutely no spark between the two. Far better and far more convincing performances come from Ian McKellen as Grail scholar Leigh Teabing, Paul Bettany as murderous monk Silas and Jean Reno as Captain Fache. With what's left of Dan Brown's story and some quality performances there are a few good parts here. But it doesn't add up to anything. Nothing worthwhile at least.Anyone who read the novel could have seen a film adaptation would be quite a challenge. There is a lot of historical information to get across and sure enough the film often gets bogged down explaining the background behind the central theme of the story, the Holy Grail. And the novel took so many sudden and unexpected twists and turns which would certainly be a challenge to portray. But the way many of the plot points are revealed in the film does not even begin to match the stunning revelations of the book. Most notably the novel had one great 'A-Ha!' moment where everything gets turned on its head. It should have been the key moment, the most thrilling moment, in the film. It is not, as the big revelation comes across with a whimper not a bang. In another of the most misguided changes characters who were absolutely essential in paying off one of the novel's big themes do not even appear. All the wonderful emotion of the book's conclusion has been lost. Do not be fooled by the obligatory 'based on the novel by Dan Brown' credit. This is not Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, it is Akiva Goldsman's. And we are all the worse for it.",5,0,3,25 May 2006
Titanic," Tragic tale, triumphant film
","Titanic is now a film which people go out of their way to dismiss. Being contemptuous towards the film is the fashionable thing to do. Admitting you like the film marks you as being desperately uncool. Yes, the Titanic-mania of 1997-98 was a bit much. The box office records, the 11 Oscars...at some point people said enough was enough. But this is a film not so easily dismissed. Perhaps it was not worthy of the unprecedented frenzy which surrounded it. But it certainly does not deserve the derision it has received. It is a very solid film. A compelling story, beautiful visuals, stellar performances...this film has much to recommend it. James Cameron risked a lot to bring his vision of Titanic to the screen. The risks paid off. Titanic is great entertainment, truly captivating, at times legitimately thrilling. It's not a perfect movie, maybe it falls a touch short of true greatness but only by the thinnest of margins. All the hype, and all the eventual backlash, can't obscure the fact that this is indeed a very good movie.Of course this film is ultimately destined to turn tragic. But the film is not so much about the sinking of a ship. It is a love story. A very unique, heartwarming love story. A story about a young woman who found the love of her life. And found herself. All in the span of a few days aboard the ill-fated Titanic. Part of the film's charm is that this woman, Rose, tells us her story herself. 101 years old when we meet her Rose takes us back to the Titanic. And with her words she brings the great ship, and its passengers, back to life. One of those passengers is Cal, an arrogant man to whom, much to her chagrin, Rose is engaged. Her family needs Cal's money. Rose does not love him but family, and society, dictate she must marry this rather reprehensible man. But then things take a turn. Rose, in unusual and potentially embarrassing circumstances, meets Jack Dawson. While Rose enjoys first-class splendor Jack is a man from another world. A third-class passenger, no money to his name, no standing in society. Jack has no place in Rose's world. But, rather inevitably, Rose decides she wants a place in Jack's world. Yes, it is one of those scarcely believable stories in which a woman falls madly in love with a man she just met. But in her heart Rose knows. Jack is the one. She must follow her heart. She will throw away her privileged life to be with the man she loves. Unfortunately Cal is not going to give her up easily. But before this conflict can play itself out an iceberg intervenes.The love story of Rose and Jack is easy to embrace, especially when you contrast Jack, so good-hearted, with the vile Cal. Leonardo DiCaprio performs the role of Jack very well, making you believe there is so much more to this guy than is readily apparent. Jack is no ordinary third-class nobody and DiCaprio captures this unique individual wonderfully. But for as good as DiCaprio is it is Kate Winslet who is the real star here. Rose goes on an incredible journey of personal growth and Winslet nails it every step of the way. Rose is radiant, smart, witty and ultimately heroic. Winslet brings all those characteristics to the screen perfectly. Rose finds she is stronger, in so many ways, than she ever imagined. It takes a great actress to evolve along with such a character. And Winslet is clearly a great actress. For as good as DiCaprio and Winslet are in the two key roles the performance of Billy Zane as Cal, the main antagonist, leaves much to be desired. Zane takes Cal's villainy to cartoonish levels, by the end it's impossible to take the character seriously. Spitting his lines rather than speaking them Zane seems absolutely desperate for attention. Unfortunately the attention he brings upon himself is that of sticking out like a sore thumb in an otherwise stellar cast. Cal had to be evil to make the film's story work. But Zane overplays it so badly you half expect to find out that it was Cal who steered the ship into the iceberg and that he did it on purpose.Zane aside the rest of the supporting cast is excellent. While the lead characters are fictional there are many true-life figures aboard the ship. Some, such as ship builder Thomas Andrews, come across very well. Others, such as White Star Line managing director J. Bruce Ismay, do not. Whether those they portray are ultimately heroic, or quite the opposite, the cast by and large do an excellent job bringing these historical figures to life. And Cameron, with a great visual sense, beautiful sets, and state of the art effects, brings the ship to life. Titanic sails again. For the film to really work you had to believe you were really aboard a ship steaming across the Atlantic. Cameron makes it happen. We're right on board, right there with the passengers as they embrace the ship's majesty. And right there with them as the ship sinks to the bottom of the ocean. It is the love story which is at the heart of the film's success. But the sinking of the ship is spectacular, both haunting and thrilling. Perhaps the most fun sequence in the film comes when Rose wanders down to third-class where a raucous party is in full swing. We know that nearly all of those passengers are doomed. But Rose ensures they will not be forgotten. In telling us her story she tells us theirs as well. Through her Cameron has given a voice to all who were lost on that tragic night. Titanic is a film not without its flaws. But it is a film journey well worth taking. Three hours fly by as we follow the first, and last, journey of the great ship.",7,1,2,17 July 2014
The Happening," It's not happening
","Who keeps giving M. Night Shyamalan money to make these movies? Seriously, what studio executive read this script and thought that making this movie would be a good idea? After the disaster that was Lady in the Water Shyamalan comes back with a movie which unbelievably, almost impossibly, may actually be worse. Lousy acting, laughably bad dialogue and a story which is just downright stupid combine to make one terrible movie.Anyhow the story here is that starting in New York City and then quickly spreading through the Northeast everyone is suddenly killing themselves. Everyone drops what they're doing, seemingly goes catatonic for a moment and then offs themselves anyway they can. Fling themselves off the top of a building, shoot themselves in the head...whatever. What could possibly make people do this? Obviously it must be some kind of terrorist attack or so everyone thinks. There certainly is something bad in the air and people need to flee. And here we meet our main characters, a Philadelphia high school science teacher and his wife along with his friend and his friend's daughter. They get out of the city, inevitably get stuck in the middle of nowhere, the characters begin to do and say things which make no sense whatsoever and the whole movie falls apart as we watch people try to run away from the wind.Mark Wahlberg has the central role here and his performance is truly awful. Certainly he isn't helped by the hideous script but it really seems as if Wahlberg can do nothing right. He seems rather emotionless for a guy trying to figure out why everyone's engaging in mass suicide. As his wife, Zooey Deschanel goes through the film with a blank stare on her face. Some of the corpses show more life. Most of the other characters we meet make a bad impression if they make any impression at all. Some truly bizarre people wander in and out of this movie. And all of them are forced to spout dialogue which is so bad it often becomes unintentionally funny. Somebody wrote that? Really? Ha-ha. But as bad as the acting and dialogue are it's the story which is the biggest problem. Once the movie reveals what actually is happening it becomes impossible to take the story seriously. Stupid. So very, very stupid. The premise makes no sense, doesn't work at all, and thus the movie is doomed to failure. I really can't fathom that after reading the script anyone actually encouraged Shyamalan to go ahead and make this movie. The Sixth Sense sure was a long time ago.",4,151,229,30 January 2009
The Untouchables," Somewhat disappointing
","Here we have a movie which tells the story of Eliot Ness and his efforts to bring Al Capone to justice. Playing very fast and loose with the facts of the real Ness/Capone story this is definitely a Hollywood version of the Prohibition saga. Honestly there seems to be very little based in fact here other than that there once indeed lived men named Eliot Ness and Al Capone. So the movie isn't going to work as a history lesson. Does it work simply as a movie? Not as well as one might hope. The movie holds your attention throughout, the story is certainly compelling. But there are definitely problems littered throughout the film. You get the sense all the film's pieces never quite come together as well as they should.One of the movie's biggest problems is right at its heart. Kevin Costner's portrayal of Ness always seems a bit off. The character comes across as very bland, Costner seems to often be scared to show even a hint of emotion. He's rather boring and that's certainly not good. Meanwhile in portraying Capone we have Robert De Niro who appears to be acting in an entirely different movie than everybody else. With the film focusing mostly on Ness and his lawmen the Capone sequences often seem forced and oddly out of place. And, aside from one instance where he provides a novel use for a baseball bat, we never really see Capone's ruthless streak. In fact De Niro's Capone at times seems almost charming, likable even. Something about that doesn't seem right. Undoubtedly the best performance in the film comes from Sean Connery playing an Irish beat cop who, in the real history, never actually existed. Connery gets the lion's share of the memorable lines and certainly does well with the role.Director Brian De Palma, as is his wont, goes for the memorable visuals and the 'look at me, aren't I brilliant' directorial touches. The famous baby on the staircase sequence? If it wasn't an homage you'd call it downright silly. Actually even as an homage it's still rather silly. And almost interminable. Unfortunately De Palma seems far too often to be more interested in filming things in a unique fashion than in making sure his story works. And sometimes the story simply isn't working. The movie is often too Hollywood for its own good. There are some things which you see up on the screen which simply aren't believable, having that 'only in the movies' feel which takes you out of the film entirely. Most notable is when one character has perhaps the longest death sequence in film history. You can't help but find yourself saying 'shouldn't you be quite dead by now?' Matters often aren't helped by the widely praised musical score which in actuality is at times rather intrusive and jarring. What we're left with is a movie which works in bits and pieces but which doesn't quite add up. With all the big names in the cast, and with the undeniably compelling story the film is (loosely) based on, you get the sense this film should have ended up being better than it actually is.",6,0,3,22 August 2009
The Godfather: Part III," OK, so it's not as good as the first two
","Judged on its own merits The Godfather: Part III would probably be remembered as a pretty good film. But this film was never going to be judged on its own merits. It was always going to be compared to the first two Godfather films. And, not surprisingly considering the first two are among the most acclaimed and revered films of all time, Part III doesn't measure up. That doesn't make this a bad film though. Yes it has some notable flaws but there are certainly enough good things here to make this final journey into the world of the Corleone family worthwhile.The most obvious and most often repeated criticism of Part III regards Sofia Coppola's performance as Mary Corleone. And the performance is indeed rather terrible. But all the criticism of Sofia Coppola is more than a bit overblown. She was bad but she didn't deserve all the vitriol she received. On a first viewing of the film she certainly sticks out like a sore thumb, especially considering all the quality performers around her. But when you go back and watch the film again you realize that while her character was an important one in the story she's really not on the screen all that much. She's certainly not front and center to the point her presence could possibly sink the whole film. The criticism she received is way out of proportion with her actual impact on the film. And while she has some truly terrible moments there are some times where she's at least passable. The legend of the awful Sofia Coppola Godfather: Part III performance has far outstripped reality.Sofia Coppola's awkward performance may get the most attention but it is not the only flaw with the film, certainly not the most important one. The biggest flaws deal with the story which is rather convoluted. So many shadowy figures lurking in the background, so many different strands of the plot which need to be tied together. The first two Godfather films were grand and epic. That sense of grandeur is missing here. The story is big, director Francis Ford Coppola is clearly aiming for epic. But this film falls short of that mark. Where the first two films built momentum all the way through this film is saddled with a story which only moves forward in fits and starts. With so much going on some important characters are never really properly developed. Who exactly is Don Lucchesi anyway and what strings is he pulling in the Vatican? What exactly is Archbishop Gilday's role in all this? Not really sure. Don Altobello, with the Corleone family or against them? And why? By the time some of these questions are answered, and some of them are never really answered satisfactorily, it's too late. The story seems to have gotten away from Francis Ford Coppola a bit and when he tries to bring it all together in the end, as he did so well in the first two films, the payoff isn't nearly as great this time around.Viewed through the prism of the first two films Part III is certainly a bit of a letdown. But rather than bemoan what it isn't, namely one of the greatest movies of all time like its predecessors, you can still enjoy and appreciate this film for what it is. If you can get your head around the story there are a lot of things to like about the film. Al Pacino is terrific as ever as a now beaten-down, worn-out Michael Corleone. Old reliables Diane Keaton and Talia Shire are back for another go although Robert Duvall is sorely missed, his replacement George Hamilton making no real impact at all. There are some good new characters. Andy Garcia does a very good job in portraying Sonny's hotheaded illegitimate son Vincent Mancini, newly welcomed into the Corleone family business. Eli Wallach is excellent as old Don Altobello even if the script doesn't provide us with much insight into the character. Donal Donnelly does very well with the role of the nervous Archbishop Gilday, a man with the weight of the Vatican bearing down on his shoulders. Unfortunately Gilday is another somewhat undeveloped character. Amongst other new characters Don Lucchesi is woefully undeveloped, Joey Zasa is an underwhelming antagonist and Mary Corleone has the aforementioned, if overblown, Sofia Coppola problem. The flaws with this film are plain to see. But the good outweighs the bad. This film was always going to be held to an impossible standard. It falls short of greatness but it still manages to pack quite a punch. Michael Corleone's journey is at an end, the saga is complete. History may deem The Godfather: Part III to be a disappointment. But that is really not fair. It is a good film and a worthy conclusion to one of film's most epic tales.",7,1,3,5 March 2011
The Fountain," What a mess
","The Fountain is one of those movies which when you say you didn't like it those who did like it get very pretentious and say 'Well you just didn't get it'. No, I got it. And I hated it. It's nonsensical, interminable and in the end quite laughable. Just an absolute mess. This film spends 96 minutes (and it seems infinitely longer) beating you over the head with how important it is. Writer/director Darren Aronofsky is apparently very concerned with getting across his point about life and death and the meaning of it all. Maybe there is a powerful message in here somewhere. Too bad the message is stuck in such a terrible movie.Trying to unravel the plot here is really a waste of time. Suffice to say it's a lot simpler than it seems. Really it's not that hard to 'get it'. Unfortunately even if you understand exactly what's going on here that surely doesn't mean you'll like the film. Aronofsky takes a pretty simple story and tries to jazz it up with all kinds of special effects and fantasies. But it just doesn't work at all. Really all this film is about is a man not wanting his wife to die. That's it. All the existential mumbo-jumbo surrounding that basic story ends up falling flat. Aronofsky was apparently so concerned with making a statement that he failed to notice he was making a very bad movie. Anything nice to say? Well, many of the visuals are stunning. That's something I guess. But pretty visuals can't hide the failings of the story. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz have in other films proved themselves to be fine performers but they've got nothing to work with here. It was an admittedly intriguing concept and ambitious effort from Aronofsky but he couldn't pull it off. The film can best be summed up by one moment near the end. After being so darned serious, so determined to get its message across you figure at least the movie must be building to an eye-opening, thought-provoking, wondrous climax. Instead you get one of the most laughable moments in film history, a moment so bad you may well find yourself throwing things at the screen. I won't spoil it here, you'll know it when you see it. It's a moment which sums up the film itself as it's meant to be painfully serious but is unintentionally hilarious. At this point you'll certainly be laughing at the filmmaker, not with him. Give credit to Aronofsky for thinking outside the box (way, way outside the box) but the sad truth is his movie fails miserably.",3,23,46,11 January 2008
It's a Wonderful Life," It's A Wonderful Film
","Heartwarming, uplifting, and entertaining...quite a combination for a film and that is what It's A Wonderful Life delivers. It's a terrific story, performed wonderfully by a terrific cast. It is easy to see why It's A Wonderful Life has become a Christmas staple and one of the most beloved films of all time.Following the life of George Bailey of small-town Bedford Falls, It's A Wonderful Life actually begins at the end with George contemplating suicide. The angel Clarence is to be sent to persuade George to go on living but first Clarence must understand exactly who George Bailey is. So he, and we the viewers, are shown the life story of George Bailey. We see that young George was a man with big dreams, planning to go off to college and see the world. Then we see the twists of fate which will leave George forever trapped in Bedford Falls and finally we see what has led him to the darkest moment of his life. Through it all, James Stewart is brilliant in the role of George. This is a character who really evolved over time and Stewart's performance is terrific in conveying all the necessary emotions in tracing George's journey. And even when George is at his most desperate and not acting particularly nicely Stewart has been so charming, so likable, so seemingly good-at-heart, you can't help but root for him and that is key to the film's success. When George opines to the angel Clarence that the world would have been better off had he never been born we know how wrong he is before Clarence even gets the chance to try to convince him of just that.While Stewart's George is obviously the key figure the supporting cast is also top-notch, led by Donna Reed as Mary, the love of George's life. Wholesome yet positively radiant and endlessly charming, Reed makes it very easy for the audience to fall in love with her just as George has. Lionel Barrymore gives a memorable performance as the film's one true villain, the rich and rather obnoxious Mr. Potter. Barrymore proves the perfect foil to go up against the basic goodness we see in Stewart's character. Thomas Mitchell as the bumbling Uncle Billy and Henry Travers as the angel Clarence also do fine work. Bringing it all together, director Frank Capra really tugs at the heartstrings and ultimately delivers one of the most uplifting films of all time. Some of the situations and dialogue in the film may seem a little dated, perhaps even a little corny, by our modern standards. And some may feel It's A Wonderful Life is a little over-the-top in its goodness, almost too good to be true. If those are the worst things that can be said about a film then it must be quite a good film indeed.",8,1,5,1 February 2006
A Beautiful Mind," Beautiful indeed
","Mathematical genius John Nash is a man whose life story seems tailor-made for a movie. Of course once Hollywood gets its hands on anyone's story true-life details are changed, things are jazzed up to make things seem more dramatic than they actually were. In A Beautiful Mind though the Hollywood treatment works and is actually quite understandable. In order for his film to succeed director Ron Howard had to somehow take us inside the mind of the schizophrenic John Nash. Howard pulls this off brilliantly and that more than anything else is what enables the film to succeed. It's not the entirely true story of John Nash's life but it's close enough. And the story that is presented here is undeniably compelling, dramatic and entertaining. It was a very challenging story to tell and Howard, helped no doubt by his stellar cast, pulls it off wonderfully. A Beautiful Mind is a rousing success.In order for this film to work the actor portraying the brilliant but troubled Nash would have to be rather brilliant himself. And Russell Crowe is definitely up to the task. He hits all the right notes, capturing the tremendous highs and terrifying lows of Nash's life. From the young man we first meet at Princeton to the old man who has accomplished and overcome so much it is an incredible journey for John Nash. And Crowe is dead-on perfect throughout. He makes you believe in John Nash and makes you understand what is going on inside his mind. What exactly is going on inside that mind? A very complicated question that but the film portrays Nash in a way that draws you in and makes you pull for him as he battles his own inner demons.Nash himself is obviously the film's most important character and thus Crowe's performance the most important and ultimately the most memorable. But this is a film in which the acting is uniformly terrific. After Crowe it is Jennifer Connelly who would be the next real standout with her portrayal of Nash's wife Alicia. Through all the ups and downs Alicia is right there with John and Connelly turns in a powerful, highly charged, emotional performance. The strength of both the actress and the character she portrays adds so much to the film. Also noteworthy is Ed Harris who gets to portray a mysterious, menacing character around whom much of the film's drama swirls. And the list of fine performances goes on and on. Paul Bettany, Christopher Plummer, Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp, Josh Lucas...every performer plays their part so well. All the performances combine with a great, fascinating story to make this a film which captivates throughout. Not every great story makes for a great movie. This one does.",8,0,2,26 October 2010
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Yawn-inducing 'action' movie
","So if you're going to make an action movie shouldn't there be some, you know, action? Mr. & Mrs. Smith doesn't have nearly enough action and what little action we have is either completely unoriginal or completely laughable. Let's throw in a car chase because Lord knows that hasn't been done to death in approximately 7,643,286 other movies before this one. Let's have our two 'heroes' (and I use that term very loosely) survive what in any movie with half a brain would be completely unsurvivable situations. Whatever intelligence you have, this movie will insult it.Anyhow the plot, such as it is, revolves around John and Jane Smith, a not so happily married couple who unbeknownst to one another are both professional assassins. They work for different people, these people find out their assassins are married to one another and assign them to kill each other. And there the fun begins. Well, actually no it doesn't. There is no fun. Ever. The film begins by straining to show you just how boring and mundane the Smiths' lives seemingly are. All these scenes, which go on for forever and a day, serve to do is put you to sleep. The Smiths are boring and so is this movie. Once the 'action' begins a bunch of things get blown up real nice but that's about it. You never feel anything for the characters, there's no emotion at all, and the movie just sits there until the next utterly ridiculous action sequence comes along. After that the characters, and the audience, can go back to sleep.The only thing that makes this movie even remotely noteworthy is the fact that the Smiths are played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, whom you may have read a thing or two about in the papers. Suffice to say I hope the couple has more chemistry in real life than they do on the screen because there is absolutely zero sizzle between these two in this movie. Pitt at least seems to be trying and has a few good comic moments. Jolie on the other hand is as wooden, dull and lifeless as a beautiful woman stuffed into a series of skimpy outfits can possibly be. She seems incredibly bored. Given the script she has to work with I really can't blame her. By far the best performance comes from Vince Vaughn as another assassin who shows up for all-too-brief moments of comic relief. But whenever Vaughn's scenes are done it's back to Pitt and Jolie, and back to sleep. Speaking of Vince Vaughn, I'll bet this is probably not one of Jennifer Aniston's favorite movies. It won't be one of yours either.",4,2,5,12 April 2006
The Departed," And the Oscar goes to...
","Well, Martin Scorsese finally got his Oscar. Long overdue. Some may quibble and say the film for which he was rewarded was not his best. Those who say that may have a point. But that's really not important. The questions which must be asked are whether this film is worthy of being an Oscar winner and worthy of being forever remembered as the film which broke the infamous Scorsese Oscar curse. The answers to those questions? Resoundingly yes. The Departed stands in its own right as a remarkable film, one of the best to come along in quite some time and clearly worthy of any and all awards it has received. Maybe not Scorsese's best but if not it's pretty darned close.Where to begin? So many different things come together to make The Departed the standout film that it is. There's a great story, a terrific cast full of big-name performers clearly on top of their games, wonderful visuals, a perfect soundtrack...all capped by that unique Scorsese touch. In this film Scorsese goes back to the familiar world of organized crime. This time the mobsters are Irish rather than Italian and the story unfolds in Boston rather than New York but it will all seem rather familiar to the Scorsese devotee. But this is not just another Scorsese mob movie. It's as intense and gritty and violent as you would expect but The Departed is quite unique, thanks mostly to the wonderfully involved and intricate story which unfolds in the film. For everything else the film has going for it in the end, as it usually does, it comes down to the story.The plot really revolves around two figures, Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan and Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan. The two both come from Boston's rather proud but rather rough Irish community. After very different experiences in their youth, both end up in the same place, becoming Massachusetts state troopers. But soon their paths will diverge again and the story really begins to pick up steam. Sullivan has become a cop for one reason, to provide inside information to Frank Costello, the gangster whose presence is always looming over Boston's Irish neighborhood. Sullivan's a mole. Soon Costigan will be too, assigned to go undercover and infiltrate Costello's gang. Quite a tangled web. Soon both the police and Costello are well aware they each have a rat inside their organization and Costigan and Sullivan will be racing to unmask each other before being discovered themselves. A very high-stakes drama this is as the potential consequences of being discovered are painfully obvious for our respective rats.While the story is thoroughly engrossing, great actors are required to bring that story to life. And one thing The Departed surely has no shortage of is great actors. DiCaprio and Damon are both terrific, each bringing just the right personality to their respective characters who are quite a bit alike but also so different in many important ways. Damon seems more calm and collected, DiCaprio more edgy and intense and those emotions work perfectly for the two characters. Playing Frank Costello is Jack Nicholson who is typically brilliant. Authoritative, menacing, diabolical and always dangerous...that's Frank Costello and who better for such a role than Nicholson? DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson have the three meatiest roles but there are plenty of opportunities for other actors to shine as well. Mark Wahlberg breathes great life into the character of Sgt. Dignam, one of Costigan's handlers within the police force. Dignam is a man of great conviction and passion and whenever Wahlberg is on the screen you get the sense there is always something fierce simmering just beneath the surface. Well played. There are other big names in the cast like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin who fall perfectly into their smaller roles. And there are countless less-familiar faces who also do fine work. It seems Martin Scorsese has brought the best out of each and every member of his cast. And in doing so he has been able to wring as much drama as possible out of the terrific story with which he had to work. A great story, performed wonderfully by a terrific cast, all touched by the hand of a master director. Add it all up and you have something truly special, a wonderful film worthy of all the accolades it has received.",9,2,3,18 April 2007
Die Hard," Average at best
","New York City cop John McClane has flown to Los Angeles to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly. He arrives on Christmas Eve and heads to Holly's office, where her company's Christmas party is in full swing. Holly does not work for some ordinary company. She works for the Nakatomi Corporation, whose headquarters are located high up in the Nakatomi Plaza skyscraper which is still under construction. In this office there is a vault. In this vault there are bearer bonds worth $640 million. Enter Hans Gruber. He and his heavily-armed goons storm the building, take everybody hostage and set in motion their plan to open that vault and get that money. Only one thing stands in their way: John McClane.McClane is conveniently the only person in the building who manages to escape being taken hostage. He then conveniently manages to stay alive as a whole swarm of well-trained, heavily-armed terrorists continually fires at him with machine guns and attempts to blow him to smithereens with powerful explosives. He makes quite the nuisance of himself, Hans is not pleased. Anyhow, there's a lot of shooting and a lot of things blowing up...and then there's a lot more shooting and a lot more things blowing up...and then...well, you get the picture. It's basically two hours of this on an endless loop. It's an action movie that indeed has lots of action but that action gets repetitive rather quickly. This movie is often described as innovative and revolutionary. That's overselling it by quite some distance. It's an average shoot-'em-up action movie. No more, no less.The best thing the movie has going for it is the talents of its two leads. Bruce Willis plays the hero, Alan Rickman plays the villain and if anything in this movie rises above the level of cliché it is their performances. Willis infuses McClane with some personality, delivering wisecracks which bring a smile to your face. Rickman makes Hans into a rather unique villain, a detestable guy to be sure but one with some serious intelligence and cunning. Unfortunately these two main characters spend very little time actually squaring off with one another, McLane spending the bulk of the movie dealing with a bunch of anonymous bad guys you really don't care about. Supporting characters offer very little support. Aside from McClane and Hans there's not much there. Reginald VelJohnson has a few good moments playing an LAPD officer who comes onto the scene. Unfortunately he is soon overshadowed by a deputy police chief character whose stupidity is just mind-boggling. Any momentum the movie threatens to gather comes to a screeching halt anytime this guy opens his mouth. Then some FBI guys show up and remarkably they're even worse. There's a lot of stupidity outside Nakatomi Plaza. And there aren't enough interesting things happening inside the building. Die Hard is a movie which is considered to be a standout in the action movie genre, a classic. The truth is it's a rather ordinary movie.",5,8,16,28 January 2015

She revels in the luxuries of Amanda's swanky digs. Meanwhile Amanda is well and truly out of her element in the small cottage in the English countryside. On day one she plans to fly back home on day two. But then there's a knock on the door in the middle of the night, Iris' inebriated brother Graham looking for a place to sleep. Hey, you don't suppose Amanda and Graham might fall for one another do you? As I said, tried and true romantic comedy formula. Back in Los Angeles things are going well for Iris. She meets some interesting people, most notably Arthur, an old man with quite a life story. He was a writer during the Golden Age of Hollywood and he and Iris strike up an unusual and thoroughly charming friendship.The film meanders quite a bit, bouncing back and forth between Amanda and Iris. It does drag at times, at 136 minutes long the film is probably a half hour or so too long for its own good. It's rather predictable, sticking to its formula though it does manage to spring a good surprise or two. For much of its running time the film is much more focused on Amanda and Diaz than on Iris and Winslet. Which is a shame because Iris is a much more likable, embraceable character than Amanda. Plus, it's nice to see Winslet in a lighthearted romantic comedy, just having fun. We know she's a great actress, here she gets a chance to just be funny and enjoy herself and she does very well with the opportunity. Not that Diaz is bad, she does well with her part as well and eventually some of Amanda's rough edges do wear down allowing that character's story to become more enjoyable. The pairing of Diaz and Jude Law, playing Graham, works well. Law is perfect playing a cad, albeit a charming cad. And just when you think you've got his character pegged his story goes to some surprising, interesting places. Meanwhile the pairing between Winslet and Eli Wallach, playing Arthur, is tremendous. Two magnificent performers bringing the best out of one another. Of course to fit the formula we need a romantic interest for Winslet's character so enter Jack Black. Jack Black? Certainly not the conventional choice for a romantic leading man but it works. Yes, even Jack Black is charming in this movie. The Holiday is no work of great, classic cinema. It's just a routine romantic comedy and for its genre it's better than most. It's got wit, laughs, charm and very good performances. Yes, it's predictable and formulaic. Sometimes the formula works.",7,0,2,6 May 2013
Wedding Crashers," It has its moments
","Wedding Crashers is a movie that has some fine parts but in the end those parts don't quite add up to form a satisfying whole. This is a film in which the whole is somehow less than the sum of its parts. The plot is straightforward and simple as can be, with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson playing two guys who crash weddings to pick up women. That's the entire plot and it seems that the writers figured they could just set up that premise and much hilarity would then ensue. Unfortunately only intermittent hilarity ensues. When it's good, Wedding Crashers is very good but the comic energy is never really sustained. There are far too many scenes where nothing, certainly nothing very funny, happens.As Jeremy and John respectively Vaughn and Wilson are pretty much what you would expect them to be. Vaughn's the fast-talking yapper, Wilson much more relaxed. Each fills their respective role well. The movie takes off, or at least is meant to, when Wilson's John falls for Claire Cleary, the beautiful daughter of the Treasury Secretary, at Claire's sister's wedding. Meanwhile yet another Cleary sister, Gloria, clings to Vaughn's quite reluctant Jeremy. Our two crashers find themselves invited back to the Cleary family compound where John will continue to woo Claire, conveniently ignoring the fact she is about to be engaged to a raving lunatic, while Jeremy tries to wriggle free of the just a little bit crazy Gloria. Plenty of potential for comic gold it would seem but it never all comes together.Part of the problem is that the object of John's affection, Claire as played by Rachel McAdams, is impossibly dull and almost completely devoid of any personality. Almost nothing funny happens when McAdams is on the screen. Undeniably attractive but utterly boring, it's hard to see why John would instantly fall for this woman he doesn't even know. There's nothing remarkable about her. Probably not McAdams' fault, I'm sure she has a personality but her character surely doesn't. By contrast Gloria, as played by Isla Fisher, absolutely oozes personality and the movie comes to life every time Fisher is on the screen. Fisher repeatedly steals scenes from that noted scene-stealer himself Vince Vaughn. Her all-too-brief appearances are the highlights of the film. Unfortunately we spend much more time with the rather dull by comparison Wilson/McAdams would-be romance. Also notable, and not in a good way, is Bradley Cooper playing Claire's ridiculously over-the-top evil fiancée Sack. He's so bad you cringe every time he's on the screen. Comedies are not generally meant to induce cringing. And Christopher Walken as Treasury Secretary Cleary, the head of this rather bizarre family, is woefully underused. It's obvious he could have added a great deal to the movie if given the opportunity but instead we are stuck with the boring Claire, the obnoxious Sack and a host of other characters who add next to nothing. With some terrific actors in the cast, a surprising standout performance from Fisher and some real moments of comic genius along the way you get the sense Wedding Cashers could have been something truly great. Instead it's just OK and will leave you wanting more and wondering what could have been.",6,0,0,10 July 2006
There Will Be Blood," Doesn't quite hit the heights it could have
","A tale of two films. There Will Be Blood begins with tremendous promise. Throughout the first half of the film you get the sense this may be something rather special. But as the second half plays out the film fails to live up to the great promise it seemingly had. It's a potentially exceptional film which somewhere along the line lost its way and ended up being not exceptional but merely good. Well worth seeing but in the end it is a film which comes with a touch of disappointment. So much promise but it kind of peters out. It's a good film but you know it could have been better.The movie sets up as a Daniel Day-Lewis showcase and his performance as early 1900s oilman Daniel Plainview is indeed remarkable. Perhaps a bit of overacting here and there but all in all a terrific job. The character of Plainview is cold, ruthless, almost entirely unsympathetic and perhaps a bit off his rocker. Seeing this man go about his business, cheaply buying up incredibly valuable oil-rich land, is a perverse treat. When Plainview buys up one particular ranch and his massive drilling operation sets up shop in this small California community the film reaches its tipping point. The ranch in question belongs to the Sunday family, whose most notable member is young preacher Eli who seeks some of Plainview's money to allow him to do the only thing which seems to matter to him, expand his church. Suffice to say Plainview and Eli do not exactly hit it off. There are mishaps, there are complications and there is seemingly quite the platform built for a fascinating second half of the film. And then the whole thing falls a little bit flat.Unfortunately the story in the film's second half doesn't really engage. There's just not a whole lot of interest going on and the movie begins to drag as it strains to reach its conclusion. This movie belongs to Day-Lewis all the way and his character of Plainview is a fascinating one. But as the film plays out it is as if there's nothing left to do with the character. We've established that he's cold and ruthless, that he pretty much hates everybody, that he can't stand to see anyone else succeed. Where do we go from there? Apparently nowhere as there's really nothing new for Plainview to do. The movie just kind of sits there as we watch Plainview be a mean, miserable louse. When we finally reach the end, a rather unsatisfying and peculiar end at that, there is a sense of disappointment. Day-Lewis is great, overshadowing pretty much everyone and everything around him. Playing Eli, the other key character in the film, Paul Dano was always going to suffer by comparison and his character too often comes across as weak and ineffectual. It's a Day-Lewis tour de force and in the conflict between Plainview and Eli, it is Day-Lewis who dominates. It's his movie, nobody else was ever going to measure up to his performance. But outstanding as his performance may be the film still never hits the heights it could have. The film certainly looks nice, with some truly wonderful cinematography. And Day-Lewis is indeed terrific. But in the end this is a film which could have been great but will have to settle for being merely good. Worth watching but not remarkable.",7,0,4,9 July 2008
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Madness
","The Bridge on the River Kwai is a World War II film. One of those big movie war epics. But epic though it may be this film is not about the massive global conflict. This is a small story, a story really of two men and their war of wills. The fact that these two men are each in their own way quite mad makes for a fascinating story. It's a story with great moments of triumph and bitter moments of despair. It's a story of great bravery in the face of unspeakable brutality. But really, at its heart, it's a story of madness.The story unfolds in a Japanese prison camp in the jungles of Thailand. A large unit of British prisoners proudly and defiantly whistle a famous march as they are brought into the camp. They have no idea what they're in for. Perhaps some of them noticed the graves being dug as they were marched in. That should serve as a hint. This camp is an impossibly terrible place, led by a brutal, seemingly sadistic man in the camp commandant Colonel Saito. The strong-willed Saito will meet his match in the British commanding officer Colonel Nicholson, a man who lives by rules and stands on principle. But Nicholson will immediately find that in this camp there are no rules and there certainly don't seem to be much in the way of principles either. Saito has a job for his new British prisoners. They are to build a bridge over the River Kwai. And the British officers will be forced to perform manual labor alongside their men. Nicholson cannot abide the officers being put to work, it's against the rules. Where does standing up for the rules get Nicholson? Locked inside a small iron box that's where.And so the war of wills begins. Saito has a bridge to be built and he has a deadline. He will complete this bridge by any means necessary because if he fails he will have no choice but to kill himself. Madness. Meanwhile Nicholson stands on principle which only leads to torture and a seemingly inevitable death for himself and his officers. Madness. From a certain perspective it can be said that Nicholson shows great bravery. But to what end? In playing this brave, principled, somewhat deranged man Alec Guinness turns in an astonishing performance. There is little doubt Guinness is the best thing the film has to offer. And he has a worthy foil in Sessue Hayakawa who plays Saito. Two great actors portraying two stubborn men who are too set in their ways to change. And their stubbornness can only have dire consequences.The story of the camp and the building of the bridge is fascinating, dramatic and highly charged. Unfortunately there is a parallel storyline which does not work nearly as well. William Holden plays Shears, an American who escapes from the camp early on in the film. As he recovers he clearly enjoys his newfound freedom as he waits to be shipped back home. He's living the good life, including partaking in a romantic dalliance which seems to serve no purpose other than to shoehorn a female character into the film someplace. But Shears, much to his consternation, finds that he's not going home. He's going back to the prison camp along with a team of British commandos who are going to blow up the bridge.Holden's performance is perfectly fine, as are those of the other actors in this section of the film, but the story of the attempt to blow up the bridge doesn't engage the way the story of the bridge's building does. Time spent away from Nicholson and Saito, Guinness and Hayakawa, is for this movie time not well spent. By this point in the movie we're utterly fascinated with Nicholson and the rather bizarre pride he takes in his men's efforts to build the bridge. His bridge. It's not Saito's bridge anymore which causes the Japanese commander no small sense of shame. The story of Nicholson and Saito, Nicholson mostly, is incredibly compelling. And Guinness is so perfect in his portrayal of this brave but mad man that you really miss his presence when the film veers away from its main storyline to follow the trek of the commando team through the jungle. But at least you know something quite spectacular is bound to occur when the two threads of the plot come together. Madness indeed.",7,1,2,23 April 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A Nicholson tour de force
","Every great once in a while there comes along an acting performance which elevates a very good movie and turns it into something very special. Jack Nicholson gives just such a performance in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He is so good, so perfect in every way, that you are willing to overlook any minor quibbles you may have with the film and simply appreciate the magic and majesty of his performance. This is certainly not a perfect film by any means but the story is so powerful that it almost couldn't help but be a success no matter who was in the lead role. Placing the manic, irrepressible Nicholson center stage takes what always would have been at worst simply a good movie and makes it into something truly memorable.Set in bleak 1960s Oregon, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest follows Randle Patrick McMurphy, as played by Nicholson, a troublemaking prisoner sent to a mental institution even though he is rather clearly not insane. At the very least when compared to the men who will become his fellow patients on the ward McMurphy is clearly the most sane, the most 'normal' of the bunch. The men he encounters have been beaten down by the system. They've had the individuality, in fact their very lives, sucked out of them by the oppressive atmosphere in the institution. To these men, McMurphy will be something of a savior as he tries to show them there can still be more to life than their dreary day-to-day routine, some hope and joy even behind and hopefully one day beyond the institution's walls. Where McMurphy with his boundless energy, sharp wit and zest for life attempts to bring life into the ward he meets his match in the cold, domineering Nurse Ratched, played with perfect icy detachment by Louise Fletcher. Nurse Ratched very much likes having the men of the ward firmly under her thumb and will not react kindly to having her methods and authority questioned by the brash newcomer in the group. The conflict between McMurphy and Ratched is quite clear. They are fighting a battle for the minds, the very lives, of all the men on the ward. Both Nicholson and Fletcher fall into their roles perfectly. No accident both walked away with Oscars.Where Nicholson and Fletcher are clearly the key figures here the rest of the cast is spot-on as well. Each of the patients on the ward is quite unique and all of the actors involved do a terrific job of bringing these characters to life. Notable in what were very early performances in their careers are some soon-to-be familiar faces, Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd. Brad Dourif as stuttering Billy, Will Sampson as silent Chief...the list of quality performances is staggeringly impressive. These fine actors bring this tremendous story to life. There are some moments which may seem a little out of place, perhaps a little forced. And there are times where things move a little more slowly than one might like. But whenever the movie threatens to really begin to drag there is a burst of Nicholson energy to propel it forward. Enjoyable and thought-provoking, in the end the film manages to be both uplifting and heartbreaking all at once. From the screenwriters to the director, the cinematographer and the wonderful cast it's a brilliant job all around.",8,1,3,26 October 2006
The Reader," Sympathy for the devil
","The Reader is a film which for the first half of its running time goes to great pains to make sure the viewer sympathizes with the character of Hanna Schmitz. Nevermind the fact that Hanna, a woman in her mid-30s living a quiet life as a tram conductor in Germany in 1958, is carrying on an obviously inappropriate love affair with a 15-year old boy. And in actuality there is not much love at all in this supposed love affair, this is pretty much all about sex. Well, sex and reading as Hanna makes her young lover, Michael Berg, read to her before they get down to business. The reading angle is curious to say the least but that will make sense in time. Anyhow we watch as Hanna seduces the young, innocent Michael. And watch and watch and watch again as this movie certainly doesn't skimp on the sex scenes. And despite the nagging sense that this relationship is obviously wrong the film makes no bones about the fact that we're supposed to feel empathy with Hanna, to be on her side. And then just like that Hanna disappears. Eight years later we see her again. But now Hanna Schmitz is on trial. And we learn her dark secret. Hanna Schmitz was a death camp guard, responsible for the deaths of countless innocents. Are we still meant to have empathy for this woman? It's a lot harder now that's for sure. If we pity her maybe it is because of her other secret, the one she keeps hidden as she finds it to be even more shameful than her death camp atrocities. Sorting out our feelings for the complex character of Hanna Schmitz will not be easy. And we're just watching the story, Michael Berg is living it. His coming to grips with the truths with which he is confronted is what it seems this movie is ultimately all about.This is a movie which asks a lot of questions to which it appears there are no comfortable answers. Most centrally, once we learn the truth about Hanna's horrible past should we not be repulsed by this character? She is pure evil, isn't she? Or was she just, as she rather coldly explains it, doing her job? After spending so much time embracing Hanna is it so easy, for us and for Michael, to all of a sudden perceive her to be some sort of devilish monster? There is no doubt that the story this movie has to tell is a unique and thought-provoking one. And with Kate Winslet playing Hanna you know you can count on a thoroughly professional and powerful performance in the key role. Perhaps even more impressive than Winslet is David Kross in his portrayal of young Michael. We expect Winslet to be brilliant, we also expect that she may thoroughly overpower and overshadow her young counterpart. Many young actors, matched against one of the leading actresses of our time, would have been completely in over their head in this thoroughly challenging role. But Kross holds his own. Ralph Fiennes bookends the film with his portrayal of the older, adult Michael and it almost seems as if he is in an entirely different movie than everybody else. He's there at the beginning, he's there at the end and he has a moment or two sprinkled in the middle but wherever he is there's a sense that in his scenes things are somehow a bit off. No fault of his performance which is fine for what he is given to do. But this movie belongs to Winslet and Kross. As the story plays out these two performers create characters you can't help but feel for. Even if in Hanna's case you ultimately find yourself questioning what exactly it is you should be feeling. And truth be told Michael will not be found to be faultless either. Maybe he doesn't always do the right thing. Sometimes though it is not crystal clear exactly what the right thing is.There is no denying that this is a powerful film. And Winslet and Kross are certainly excellent in it. Perhaps it doesn't all come together as well as you might hope. The flashback structure doesn't always work perfectly. The pace does drag at times. And when the movie finally comes to its end there's a bit of a sense of anticlimax. It's as if the movie has reached its natural ending point but there's still another scene to be tacked on, a scene which makes sense for the story but by that point all the drama has really played itself out. But for whatever flaws there may be along the way there is no doubt that the story this movie tells is a fascinating and powerful one. And that story makes the movie well worth seeing.",7,4,6,22 January 2010
The Wrestler," A better performance than movie
","Twenty years ago Randy 'The Ram' Robinson was a professional wrestling legend. Twenty years is a long time. Now he is a lonely, broken-down shell of a man. His past glories long behind him he still wrestles but now it is far from the bright lights and big arenas. Instead he ekes out a meager living on the independent circuit, performing in front of tiny crowds in high school gyms and community centers. To help make ends meet he unloads boxes at a supermarket. He's behind on his rent. He's falling apart physically and taking enough drugs to open his own pharmacy. Hopelessly estranged from his daughter he has no family. Not much in the way of friends either as his closest relationship is with an aging stripper who keeps him at arm's length. He leads a miserable, lonely life. He longs for the 1980s, mocking Kurt Cobain while extolling the virtues of Ratt. No, Randy the Ram hasn't evolved much in the past twenty years. He is who he is and that's all it seems he will ever be. Can he change? Maybe even grow a little? He can't be Randy the Ram forever, at some point he has to get on with his life and be Randy Robinson. As you watch his story unfold you can't help but feel he'll never get to that point. This is a man whose past always haunts his present.Mickey Rourke received all kinds of accolades for his portrayal of The Ram and deservedly so. It's a gripping, powerful, somewhat haunting performance. Portraying this character is not exactly a stretch for Rourke. Sometimes it's hard to see where Rourke ends and The Ram begins. He embodies the character like no other actor could. But for as good as Rourke is the movie around him is not always up to the standards of his performance. There's very little character development. The Ram doesn't change, that's the whole point of the movie. And his character is the only one we get to know at all. His relationship with his stripper friend, played by Marisa Tomei, is never put into any context at all. We never get any sense what the real connection is between these two. We know they're both desperately clinging to careers which at their age they can't hold on to very much longer. But there has to be more to their relationship than that. At least you'd hope there would be. The emotional connection doesn't seem to be there. And this movie really could use some emotional connections. There's some emotion in The Ram's meetings with his daughter Stephanie but those scenes are fleeting. And Stephanie, played by Evan Rachel Wood, comes off as a bit of a spoiled brat. Maybe her father has given her good reason to be as cold as she is but we never get enough context to understand and appreciate that. Her character, like every character in the movie other than Randy, remains too much of an unknown. This is undeniably Randy the Ram's movie, his story. But perhaps a little too much so. And in the end where has this story taken us? It's an often bleak, depressing ride following this character whose story basically is that there is no story. He can't change. He's Randy the Ram, for good or for bad. Rourke's work here is excellent but the movie as a whole is something less spectacular.",6,1,2,9 June 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The one you've been waiting for
","An epic 28 years in the making. Revenge of the Sith takes its rightful place in the pantheon alongside A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back.Episode III begins with the most dazzling, electrifying opening sequence of any of the Star Wars films. Immediately after the familiar opening crawl we are thrust into a space battle of as grand a scale as any we have seen. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker are leading a rescue mission to free the kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, being held on the command ship of General Grievous, a new character in the saga. Grievous, an immense droid with a puzzling wheezing cough, is along with Count Dooku who we met in Episode II leading the droid armies of the Separatists waging war with the Republic, led by Palpatine. Of course any fan of the saga knows Palpatine is not at all what he seems.After the inevitable rescue (becuse after all we wouldn't have much of a film if our heroes were defeated ten minutes in) things begin to settle down. Back on the planet Coruscant, the now-familiar seat of power in the Republic, Anakin is greeted by his secret wife, Padme Amidala. Here, much as in Episode II, the film comes to a screeching halt for some truly painful romantic dialogue between Hayden Christensen as Anakin and Natalie Portman as Padme. It's not the actors' fault, let's just say writing romance is not a George Lucas strong suit. Thankfully there aren't as many of these type of scenes as in Episode II. In fact, Portman is really reduced to being a bit player this time around. Much of that has to do with the secret she has for Anakin...she's pregnant.Soon, Anakin is racked by nightmares in which he sees Padme dying in childbirth. He'll do anything to save her. Only one man seems to have the ability to help him. That man is Chancellor Palpatine who Anakin will soon discover knows a lot more about the Dark Side of the Force than you would expect of a politician from relative galactic backwater Naboo. Palpatine believes he may be able to help Anakin save his wife by using his knowledge of the Dark Side. Anakin, who by now distrusts the Jedi Council (which in turn quite clearly does not trust him) is inclined to accept any help his new mentor, Palpatine, can offer.Meanwhile Anakin's Jedi mentor, Obi-Wan who is played wonderfully again by Ewan McGregor, has gone to the planet Utapau to dispatch General Grievous. Should Grievous be eliminated the Clone Wars would be at an end and Palpatine would have to give up his emergency powers. Of course, Palpatine plans to do no such thing. Anakin will soon discover what we have known all along. Palpatine is in fact Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith the Jedi have been searching for. Having seen Episode IV we know what must come next. Sidious is confronted by Jedi seeking to place him under arrest. After an epic struggle, Anakin must decide where his loyalties lie, with the Jedi or with the only man he believes can save Padme. We know quite well what choice Anakin will make. Rechristened Darth Vader in the Sith tradition, Anakin's fall to the Dark Side is complete.Suffice to say what comes next is very, very dark as George Lucas earns his PG-13 rating. Obi-Wan must come to grips with the fact the man he considered a brother has turned to evil. Neither he nor Padme can believe it at first but they will see for themselves what Anakin has become. On the fiery lava planet of Mustafar comes the inevitable but thrilling final confrontation fans of the saga have been waiting for. In actuality there are two equally thrilling final confrontations. And in the end there is of course a new hope.After the somewhat disappointing Episodes I and II George Lucas comes through in the end. This film is epic in every sense of the word. The acting performances are, as a whole, terrific. The scenes between Christensen and Portman are awkward but those scenes are fleeting. Ian McDiarmid shines in his role as Palpatine. His is a performance worthy of any award he may be given. Samuel L. Jackson is terrific as Mace Windu. McGregor has really grown into the role of Obi-Wan, not an easy task with Alec Guinness' performances to live up to. Even Christensen, somewhat maligned last time around, brings the necessary intensity, rage and conviction of the man who would be Darth Vader. Jimmy Smits does not have much to do as Bail Organa but what he does he does well. The visuals are dazzling, the John Williams score is terrific and Jar Jar Binks is a nonentity. About the only faults which can be cited are some unwieldy dialogue and the fact that General Grievous does not turn out to be as strong a villain as might have been hoped.Standing alone as a great film Episode III also serves as the necessary bridge between the two trilogies. Many questions will be answered here. Why was Emperor Palpatine so deformed? Why were Yoda and Obi-Wan forced into exile? Why did C-3PO seem to have no memories of the events of the prequel trilogy by the time Episode IV rolled around? And of course how does Darth Vader end up in that suit? Along with answers to these and many other questions there are many more nods to the original trilogy from Padme's cinnamon-buns hairdo to our first glimpse of Chewbacca. And the ultimate connection comes right at the very end. You know what the last shot will be, this movie could end only one way. Yet it may bring a tear to your eye anyway. Finally the saga is complete. And it ends with a rousing success.",10,2,8,21 May 2005
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Disney's triumph
","Derided as Disney's Folly during its production Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs would turn out to be Disney's greatest triumph. How different the world would be had Walt Disney failed with Snow White. This was the first full-length animated feature. If it did not succeed there wouldn't be any others. At least not for a very, very long time. No Pinocchio, no Bambi, all the way up to probably no Toy Story. Because if Snow White failed there would be no Disney as we know it. And if there's no Disney the history of film, animation and all of entertainment is quite different. So much of what we have known and embraced all these decades goes back to a fairy tale princess and seven of her closest, shortest friends.Considering an animation project of this magnitude had never been undertaken it is quite remarkable just how magnificent this film looks. The colors pop, the backgrounds are fabulous, the attention to detail is tremendous. The dwarfs look absolutely terrific. Brilliant character design executed wondrously by Disney's team of animators. The personality of each dwarf shines through before any of them even speak, the visuals are so good they tell each character's story perfectly. The animals, and this film's got plenty of animals, all look great. The villainous queen, in both her incarnations, is a sight to behold. Oddly, perhaps the least visually appealing thing in the whole film is Snow White herself. She's really not all that much to look at. A flat, almost featureless face. She's an iconic film character, Disney's most famous and beloved princess. But truth is she's a bit of a plain Jane. Fairest of them all? In this case the visual doesn't quite sell that story. And her prince is a bit of a dud too. But as a whole the art and animation on display here is quite terrific, and considering the laborious process by which it was created, a little miraculous.Could the world truly be captivated by a cartoon? In 1937 most people didn't think so. A five-minute short, that's one thing. An 83-minute feature? No way a cartoon could hold the attention for that long. Wrong. Admittedly there are times when the film's story does drag. Some sequences do nothing to advance the plot, they just pad the running time to an acceptable feature length. Snow White herself is not a particularly interesting character so the film doesn't really kick into high gear until the dwarfs are introduced. They give the film its personality. They give the film a song you'll be humming for hours after the film ends. They gave the film its humor but also gave it its emotional heart. The bond they form with Snow White is what allows the film's ending to pack such an emotional wallop. Yes, a cartoon can provoke genuine, heartfelt feeling. As it is that ending may be a bit rushed. The story wraps itself up and it's The End before you know what hit you. When it's over you can look back and see there is so much to appreciate. Walt Disney gambled big and won. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is not a perfect film, some parts work better than others. But there is no denying it was a magnificent achievement for its time. It is still thoroughly enjoyable all these years later. And it is well worth its iconic place in film history.",7,2,3,4 May 2012
Shooter," Not particularly memorable
","Shooter is one of those films which is neither memorably brilliant nor memorably awful. It's stuck in kind of a movie no-man's land, reasonably entertaining but no better than just OK. It's worth seeing but you really won't be missing anything if you skip this one.Anyhow, this is one of those 'conspiracies gone wild' movies in which the whole world is out to get our hero. Mark Wahlberg plays the hero in question, former Marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger. Swagger is framed in an assassination attempt on the President and the chase is on. The FBI and those shadowy conspiracy guys hunt Swagger down while he attempts to prove his innocence without getting himself killed in the process. It's pretty much up to Wahlberg to carry the film and he does a fine job of it. Some of the material he has to work with is not particularly stellar as the movie does tend to drag at times but Wahlberg creates an engaging, easy to root for character. The supporting cast doesn't offer much in the way of support. Playing the requisite romantic interest Kate Mara's southern accent leaves something to be desired but she's otherwise fine. But her character isn't given much to do. Danny Glover really seems to be mailing in his performance as the lead bad guy. Perhaps a lesser known actor would have brought more energy to the role, Glover just seems to be there to collect a paycheck. The best performance in the supporting cast comes from Michael Peña as the one FBI agent who actually seems interested in finding the truth. Other than Wahlberg, Peña really has the only well-developed character in the movie and the actor does a good job of bringing the character to life and showing the way he evolves as the film moves along.So, what we end up with is a movie with a familiar plot, only a couple of decently written characters and some troubling acting missteps. The thing does take its sweet time in moving along, fifteen to twenty minutes easily could have been cut here without being missed. And too often the plot comes to a screeching halt for extended action sequences. Yes, you know going in this is an action movie but really, how many people can get shot and how many things can get blown up before you really become numb to it all? But if you really do like seeing things get blown up you're in for a treat. Explosions galore in this movie. In the end, the movie is a reasonably enjoyable ride. You get the sense it could have been a little better but at least be grateful because it certainly could have been a lot worse.",6,2,4,8 August 2007
Inception," Leaves your mind spinning like a top
","The first time I saw a promotional spot for this movie my immediate reaction was that this had to be the stupidest looking thing I'd ever seen. But before the spot had finished I had done a complete 180 and was convinced that this was going to be a great movie. And sure enough it is. What was it that instantly changed my mind when seeing that first commercial? A seven-word phrase popped up on the screen. 'From the director of The Dark Knight'. Ah, this is a Christopher Nolan movie. Well then it's going to be great. Because Christopher Nolan makes great movies. Every single time.As he has shown in the past Nolan likes stories which are, shall we say, complicated. He seems to revel in making the viewer's head spin round and round. And with Inception he sets your head spinning more than ever. This plot is the most intricate puzzle Nolan has ever constructed. And that's saying something because this is a man who sure does like his puzzles. With this film Nolan takes you inside the human mind. Specifically inside dreams. And then there are dreams within dreams, levels upon levels. This could get out of hand in a hurry. It's OK to play with your audience but if you leave them utterly confused and baffled your movie is doomed to fail. With this film Nolan takes things right up to the edge but manges to hold it all together just well enough to allow the audience to keep track of what's going on. And for his characters to keep track too. Wait, whose subconscious are we going through exactly?A story this complex requires a great cast to make sense of it all. And Inception certainly has a great cast. The key role of dream thief Cobb is handled expertly by Leonardo DiCaprio. Cobb is really the only character who gets much in the way of character development. He's a bit of a tortured soul. And DiCaprio captures that wonderfully while also fulfilling what in this movie is an absolutely critical task, explaining what the heck is going on. This is a story which has to be explained to the audience in rather painstaking and exquisite detail in order for it to work. And that could certainly cause things to drag but DiCaprio keeps things moving along well enough as he gets through all the necessary exposition. Surrounding DiCaprio are a team of fine players. Marion Cotillard is particularly notable as it is her character who gives the film much of its emotional weight. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ken Watanabe, Tom Hardy, Ellen Page and Cillian Murphy all turn in excellent work. And Michael Caine pops in too. It's a Christopher Nolan film, you knew Michael Caine would show up.Inception is a movie which asks a lot of its audience. You'd better be ready to do some serious thinking when you sit down to watch this one. If you're willing to play along this movie will suck you in like few others. It's such a great story, one that will keep you guessing all the way to the end. And that story is performed so wonderfully by the terrific cast. Toss in some beautiful cinematography, amazing visual effects and a wonderful musical score and you've got quite a package. That's not to say the movie's flawless. For as well as Nolan, aided largely by DiCaprio, works his way through it the movie does require a lot of effort to set itself up. So that leaves a lull here and there in the first half of the movie. But it's worth it when the movie kicks into high gear. There are times in the second half of the movie where the brilliant story is kind of shunted aside and this threatens to devolve into just another standard action movie. One particular wintry action sequence clearly goes on longer than it probably should, the film losing a little momentum just when it should be building to a big climax. And there are moments where no matter how closely you're paying attention it is a little difficult to keep everything exactly straight in your mind. But that will just make you want to go back and watch the film again. And again and again and again. You need to see it more than once and that's OK because you desperately want to see it again just as soon as you've finished watching it for the first time. For whatever little quibbles you may have with it the film is that good. Nolan did it again.",8,0,5,29 December 2010
WALL·E," An absolute treat
","Drama, comedy, romance, science fiction...this movie crosses genre boundaries, it has a little bit of everything. The visuals are stunning. The sounds, both the effects and the music, are done brilliantly. Really there's not much to quibble with here. The movie looks great, it sounds great and the story is incredibly charming and compelling. It's certainly one of the great triumphs in the annals of animation. But it shines not just in comparison with other animated features. It is so well done that it can rightly take its place in the category of classic films, right alongside all those live-action films we have come to know and love. WALL-E is not just a great animated film. It's a great film, period.Our story takes place long into the future on an Earth long since abandoned by humankind. The planet is covered in trash, to the point life on Earth is unsustainable. When the humans took off for outer space they left behind an army of trash compacting robots named WALL-E to clean up the mess. The idea was that after a five year space cruise everyone would be able to come back home. But there was just too much trash and as the film opens it has been 700 years since humans walked the Earth. And just one lonely WALL-E unit still functions. But as this unit goes about its futile cleanup task we will see that this WALL-E is no ordinary robot. It's developed a personality and the ability to feel emotion. It has even come to understand the concept of falling in love. Of course there's nothing on this deserted planet for our robot hero to fall in love with. But then EVE shows up.One day WALL-E's peaceful existence is shattered when a spaceship lands and from the ship emerges a sleek feminine robot. This is EVE and she has a mission which we will come to understand holds great importance for the future of humankind. WALL-E immediately falls hopelessly in love. Initially rather hostile, and concerned only with her mission, EVE will come to take a liking to WALL-E. But before romance can truly bloom EVE's ship returns to collect her. WALL-E will find himself along for the ride on a thrilling journey through space, the ultimate destination being the the Axiom, one of the starliners on which humankind has been living all these centuries.Aboard the Axiom we see what has become of humankind and it's not a pretty picture. Everyone is obese to the point of being unable to walk and completely dependent on the Axiom's fleet of robots for pretty much everything. But if EVE, with WALL-E's help, can complete her mission perhaps things will change. Great drama unfolds aboard the Axiom and WALL-E is right in the middle of it. This robot we have come to love will find himself in some rather perilous situations. There are some moments of great tension, some serious tugging on the viewer's heartstrings, as the film builds towards its conclusion.All in all it's a simply terrific film. The nature of the plot dictates that things start out a little slowly but the story is always intriguing. And as things play out the story will prove to be rather thrilling and more than a bit inspiring. It is a brilliantly conceived story, told for most of its running time with basically no dialogue whatsoever. Jeff Garlin, as the Axiom's captain, has the one speaking part of any real significance and he does very well with it. But this story is really told through its beautiful visuals and through the wonderfully simple sounds of our robot hero. Full credit to sound designer Ben Burtt who magically brings WALL-E to life. It may not be a perfect movie, it has a few lulls now and again. But the ultimate effect is wonderful. For all the beautiful animation and wondrous sounds what really makes the film work is its story. It's a story, and a lead character, which you can't help but embrace. Brilliantly done.",8,1,3,30 July 2009
The Blind Side," Not great but good enough
","The Blind Side is another one of those inspirational sports movies we've seen time and again. Football is the sport of choice this time as we follow the more or less true story of Michael Oher. His story is a remarkable one, a thoroughly compelling life's journey. And this movie, while nothing spectacular, does an adequate job of telling that story. What we ultimately end up with is a movie that's just entertaining enough to get by. The best sports movies have a crackling energy to them which drives the story forward. This movie, with its leisurely pace, lacks that element. Some might say that is because it's really not a sports movie at all. It's a movie about life that just happens to have some football in it. Maybe so but the movie still cries out for some excitement along the way. You may like this movie. But it's not one of those movies that makes you want to jump out of your chair and cheer. It's inspiring but in a more subtle fashion than one might expect. The movie works but it probably could have worked better.The movie tells the by now familiar story of Michael Oher's rise from a life of poverty, neglect and misery to football stardom. The story's obvious hook is that of the troubled black teen being taken in, and ultimately adopted, by a wealthy white family. A fascinating true story, one recounted pretty faithfully here by the filmmakers. A few things from the real life story have been tweaked to give the movie a little added drama but that's the way the movie business works. And the movie could use the extra drama because if there is any one failing here it is that this great story at times comes across as being a little mundane. It's that troubling lack of energy, the movie really could use a little more pep in its step.This is the Michael Oher story but the movie's star is of course Sandra Bullock playing Michael's adopted mother Leigh Anne Tuohy. It's a very good, strong-willed performance by Bullock. Nothing about the performance which absolutely screams out Oscar but there's certainly no reason to begrudge her the award. Like the movie itself you may hesitate to label her performance great but it's more than good enough. Quinton Aaron plays Michael and you kind of wish he was given more to do. He does well with what he's given to work with but there are long stretches of the movie where his character is essentially mute and appears rather bewildered. Michael Oher is often shunted to the background in the movie which purports to tell his life story. It's Bullock as Leigh Anne who's really at the heart of everything going on.While Bullock is definitely pushed front and center there is room for some other performers to make an impression. Lily Collins and Jae Head are very good in portraying the Tuohy children, with Head in particular having some memorable moments. Tim McGraw is solid if unspectacular as Leigh Anne's husband Sean, spending most of his time reacting to or getting out of the way of Bullock. Kathy Bates, Kim Dickens and Ray McKinnon do well with their respective supporting roles. And of course there's Big Mike himself. On the rare occasions Aaron is allowed to come out of his shell he's a revelation. And he does a great job in making his character utterly sympathetic, so easy to root for. But in the end, for better or worse, it's Bullock's movie. She carries it well enough to make the movie work. But you're left with the nagging sense the movie probably should have been a little better. Ultimately you're satisfied but not thrilled. It's a sports movie which comes out a winner by the slimmest of margins.",7,0,1,10 August 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Inspiration can come where you least expect it
","You go into a film hoping to be entertained. That's the least you can expect. If a film manages not only to entertain but also to inspire then you've really got something. Such is the case with The Shawshank Redemption. Few movies are as inspiring and uplifting as this tale of...an innocent man rotting away in prison? Well that doesn't sound particularly inspiring. Sounds depressing even. But this movie will surprise you. At times along the way it is rather bleak, things seem hopeless. But the movie's hero never gives up hope. He is not content to sit in prison and rot. Get busy living or get busy dying. Is there ever really any doubt which of those options Andy Dufresne will choose?In 1947 Andy, a banker on the outside, is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary for life after being wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He befriends a prisoner named Red, a man popular amongst his fellow inmates because Red is the man who can get things. Most of the men want the typical prison contraband. Cigarettes are the big item. Andy's different. He wants a tiny little rock hammer to maintain his rock collection. And later he asks for a Rita Hayworth poster. As the years go by Rita becomes Marilyn, Marilyn becomes Raquel. It's as good a way as any to mark the passage of time. Time marches on. The world moves on. But the men of Shawshank are left behind. That would be hard enough to take even if you were stone-cold guilty, a menace to society. For an innocent man like Andy Dufresne? You wonder how he cannot be utterly defeated by life. Yet somehow he maintains a sense of calm and a great inner strength. There's something about this guy.What exactly is it about Andy Dufresne? Hard to say because the story is never really told through his eyes but rather through those of his friend Red. We come to know Andy only to the extent that Red does. And for this story that setup really works. Tim Robbins is excellent in the role of Andy, the film's hero figure, but Morgan Freeman has perhaps the more challenging job in playing Red. Freeman's character serves as the audience's eyes and ears. And he also serves as the movie's voice. Extensive use of voice-over narration in films can be an iffy proposition, often proving more distracting than helpful. But Freeman's voice, Red's voice really, narrates this story beautifully. Playing off one another wonderfully Robbins and Freeman make a terrific team. This is a movie content to let its two main characters just sit around and talk. True, there's not much else to do inside those prison walls. But some of the shared moments between Andy and Red are as poignant as any you'll see in any film and the two actors deserve their due credit for making it so.You wouldn't go so far as to call it slow but the movie certainly proceeds at a deliberate pace. This is a story which takes its time in letting you know where it is ultimately headed. It's essentially Andy's story, as told by Red. But there is room for some other characters to carve out their place as well. Most touching is the story of elderly prisoner Brooks, as played beautifully by James Whitmore. His little story within the story definitely tugs on the heartstrings. Of course for any movie to truly succeed there has to be some conflict and for that we have guard Byron Hadley and warden Samuel Norton. At least Hadley is upfront in his evilness. Norton's one of film history's biggest hypocrites, walking around the prison spouting Bible verses all the while being engaged in all manner of unseemly activities. This is a man who needs a comeuppance. But in the world of Shawshank it is Norton who has all the power. This is a story seemingly destined for a very unhappy ending. The righteous man does not seem at all likely to prevail. But, slowly but surely, the movie continues to build towards something. What that something will be you can't quite be sure. But when the moment comes where all is revealed the film's ultimate triumph is secured. For you have seen not only an entertaining and utterly compelling story. You've seen something which can't help but make you feel better about life in general. This is a movie to see when you need to have a little of your faith in humanity restored. It may not be, as it is in some places proclaimed to be, the best movie ever made. But is an undeniably excellent movie which has rightfully become rather beloved by most everyone who sees it.",8,1,1,8 August 2010
Back to the Future Part II," Back to the First Movie
","The journey continues, picking up right where we left off at the end of Back to the Future. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. So off to 2015 we go. The future. And then we go hurtling back to the past, 1955 again. With a pit stop in a dystopian 1985 in between. It's quite the adventure, albeit a tad confusing if you're not really paying attention. The first movie was very straightforward, Marty McFly stuck in the past having to ensure his parents ended up together. Simple. This one is not so simple, it's a bit of a maze. But a maze well worth working your way through. Back and forth through time Marty and Doc Brown go and we're along for the very enjoyable ride.In 2015 Marty and Doc do what they set out to do, preventing Marty's future son from getting himself in major future trouble. And the vision of what 2015 would look like which director Robert Zemeckis presents is a hoot. Flying cars are only the start. But Marty and Doc aren't there for some time-travel sightseeing, they accomplish their mission and get the heck out of there and head back to 1985 before they can screw anything up. Little do they know they screwed everything up. When they get back to 1985 it is not the Hill Valley they know and love. Hill Valley is now Hell on Earth, a miserable place lorded over by the evil Biff Tannen. What happened? Well, as Marty and Doc soon discover while they were in 2015 old Biff stole the time machine and went back to 1955 where he gave his young self a sports almanac with the results of all major sporting events for the rest of the century. Biff bets on all the winners, becomes obscenely wealthy and takes over the town. When Marty and Doc get back to 1985 they find that fate and Biff have now dealt them a very unkind hand. But if Marty thinks he's got it bad he need only look at what's happened to his poor parents who've got it much, much worse. Only one thing to do. Hop in the DeLorean and head back to 1955 to prevent Biff from getting his hands on that book. They must set right what has gone horribly wrong.It all sounds a bit convoluted and in truth there are times where the movie is a little too complex for its own good. The first movie was just flat-out fun all the way through. Here the movie has to slow down to explain itself. And things are much bleaker this time around too, the alternate 1985 being such an awful place. The sooner the movie gets out of there the better off it is. Especially considering where it is the movie's going. Back into 1955, back into the very day which served as the climax of the first film. Yep, we're going back to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance. It's the rare opportunity for a movie to go back into itself, see itself from new perspectives and Zemeckis takes full advantage of the opportunity. Those scenes we know so well from the first film are given new twists and it is here that this sequel really shines. Watching Marty try to solve his new problem without undoing what he did in the first film is simply terrific stuff. Part II may not have been as consistently captivating, nor as out and out fun, as the original but the story ultimately pays itself off brilliantly.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are pitch-perfect again as Marty and Doc. Thomas F. Wilson does a great job playing multiple incarnations of the villainous Biff. Poor Lea Thompson spends most of her screen time playing older versions of Marty's mom Lorraine, to whom time has been unkind. Thompson does what she has to do well but the film does miss that youthful charm, spunk and vivaciousness of the first film's Lorraine. And the film also clearly misses Crispin Glover in the role of George McFly. Glover is such a unique performer, he brought so much bizarre yet endearing personality to the role of George. This film's attempt to work around Glover's absence is awkward to say the least. But best not to quibble about what this movie misses. Better to embrace what it has. It's a great story which takes us on a wild journey through the space-time continuum. Yes that story requires a little effort on the part of the audience to keep up through all its twists and turns. This movie doesn't make itself as easy to enjoy as the first one did, you have to work a little for this one. It's worth working for. Marty and Doc are such great characters, such a great team. You can't wait to see where they go next. Part III couldn't come soon enough.",9,2,4,5 October 2012
Blow," Bore
","George Jung was a big-time criminal, at one point supposedly responsible for importing about 85 percent of all the cocaine in the United States. But this movie about the big-time criminal turns out to be a big-time bore. George Jung, at least the way he is presented here, is not a very interesting guy. He's no brilliant criminal mastermind. He's just a guy who was in the right place at the right time, made a lot of money and blew it all. He comes across as a rather pathetic figure. The movie tells you right in the beginning what Jung's ultimate fate is so there's no great drama in seeing how the story plays out. Even if you know how it ends, you'd think there would at least be some real excitement along the way. But nothing much happens. George has some issues with the feds and some issues with his partners and some issues with his miserable shrew of a wife. But there's nothing that really grabs you, excites you. The whole movie has a very bland feel to it. Who knew drug trafficking was so dull and mundane? Johnny Depp turns in a decent performance playing George but he's let down by the fact that this guy just doesn't make for a very compelling movie character. The movie endeavors, probably misguidedly, to make you feel sympathetic towards George but chances are you really won't feel much of anything at all. Indifference reigns. And if you're making a movie that is basically about one guy and the audience ends up being indifferent towards that one guy your movie is doomed to fail. As the movie slogs along your mind may begin to wander. One thing you may find yourself wondering is hey, I thought Penélope Cruz was supposed to be in this movie. Eventually she does show up and only serves to make a bad movie worse. Her character is completely unlikeable and Cruz's overacting really grates on the nerves. But if you hate her at least you're feeling something. You never really feel anything for George. Depp does the best he can but he can't salvage this movie. You do get to see Pee-wee Herman playing a gay drug-dealing hairdresser though. So there's that.",5,2,3,11 July 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Solid. Satisfying. But not spectacular.
","The Dark Knight Rises had to be stunning and spectacular and brilliant just...because. After a very good start with Batman Begins and a truly magnificent follow-up with The Dark Knight how could Christopher Nolan go wrong? Expectations were off the charts. And those expectations were not quite met. Nolan certainly didn't get it all wrong but he surely didn't get it all right either. There's no way around it, this film is not as good as The Dark Knight. Does that mean it's a total letdown? No, not at all. It just means it is not the glorious triumph everyone expected. It's a satisfying finish to a great trilogy. People were just hoping to be able to use a better word than 'satisfying'.So why does this film not measure up to the last one? Well there are a few reasons but one stands out above the rest. It's glaring and obvious and there was nothing Nolan could have done about it. This film misses Heath Ledger's Joker. Bane is an ominous presence. But a rather dull one. And what the heck is he saying anyway? The Joker had a manic intensity to him that this film sorely misses. Stretched out to almost three hours, clearly too long for its own good, this film desperately needed some real jolts along the way. Someone had to grab a hold of the story and shake the audience up. The Joker did that, Bane does not. Yes, Bane is frightening and foreboding and clearly very dangerous. But the personality just isn't there. There's no sense of wonder. The Joker always had you on your toes, what would he do next? Bane never intrigues you that way.If you miss the Joker it could also be said that this film leaves you missing Batman. Christian Bale is solid as ever in the dual role of Bruce and Bat but in this film he spends very little time in that famous costume. We see an awful lot of Bruce Wayne, very little of Batman. The other familiar faces from the first two films are back. Gary Oldman and Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman doing what they do. New characters? Well, there's Anne Hathaway doing a better than expected job playing Selina Kyle, who's kinda sorta maybe but not really Catwoman. Marion Cotillard plays Miranda Tate, investor in a Wayne Enterprises energy project. This character is woefully underdeveloped which proves to be problematic. Tom Hardy does the best he can with Bane, a very challenging villain to portray. Hidden away behind a mask it's hard to infuse the character with any personality. And again, seriously, what the heck is he saying? And there's Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing young police officer John Blake who knows Bruce Wayne is Batman just...because.The fact this nobody cop knows Batman's identity is not the only disappointing contrivance required to move the plot along. The location of Bane's lair? Convenient. The entire Gotham police force trapping themselves underground? Very, very convenient. And dumb. And let us not even delve into Bruce Wayne's remarkable healing powers. This is a story which at times really struggles for momentum. With the Joker around lack of energy was never going to be a problem in the last film. Here things really get bogged down on more than one occasion. But while the film certainly has its flaws it does ultimately manage to satisfy. The trilogy gets the big sendoff it deserves. The Dark Knight Rises doesn't reach the spectacular heights of Nolan's last Batman effort so maybe you come away a touch disappointed. But taken on its own merits this is a good film. True greatness may elude it but it is a worthy end to a terrific saga.",7,7,13,8 February 2013
Any Given Sunday," Misses by an inch
","Oliver Stone would have you believe that his Any Given Sunday is the most realistic film depiction of professional football, both on and off the field. On the field Stone does capture much of the excitement and passion which makes people love the sport. He also is probably reasonably accurate with much of his depiction of the off-field excesses of our modern-day gladiators. But both on and off the field he probably goes a little too far. He pushed it a little beyond the point of realism and believability. Modern professional football is a grand spectacle but perhaps Stone made it just a little too grand for this movie's good.With Stone laying bare some brutal truths the NFL was never going to have anything to do with this movie. So the story follows the fictional Miami Sharks of the fictional AFFA. Their veteran coach Tony D'Amato has had a distinguished career but has the game passed him by? The team's owner certainly thinks so. Oh, by the way that owner, Christina Pagniacci, is played by Cameron Diaz. Cameron Diaz owns a football team? OK then. Well, it turns out daddy died and left his daughter the team. And Christina is no shrinking violet. She is driven and determined. Which is a nice way of saying she's a bitch. When she isn't making her coach's life miserable she's trying to blackmail Miami's mayor for a new stadium. She thinks she's in control but does anyone really respect her? The answer to that question may well disappoint her. Meanwhile his raving shrew of an owner is far from Tony's only problem. In the first game we see the Sharks lose their star veteran quarterback to injury. And then lose his backup. Enter Willie Beamen. And all hell breaks loose.In no time at all Beamen goes from anonymous third-string quarterback to superstar. Really, I mean no time at all. Sorry Mr. Stone but I don't care how well you play you don't go from complete unknown to having your own rap video and your picture on the side of every bus in town in two weeks. Just one clear instance of the movie not really ringing true. Anyhow, Beamen's winning games and exciting fans but he's driving his coach and teammates nuts. He ignores the coach, makes up his own plays, does it all his way. And despite his success he ends up tearing his team apart. The coach sees this happening and tries to rein Beamen in but it's a futile effort. Especially when the owner doesn't back the coach. The Sharks are now winning games but there's conflict all over the place. Everyone's got their own agenda. The owner, the coach, the players, the doctors, everyone's pulling in their own direction. This seems destined for a spectacular blowup.Stone has a great ensemble cast but there are two roles clearly more important than the rest. The movie is at its heart about two men, Coach Tony D'Amato and 'Steamin' Willie Beamen. Al Pacino plays the coach and is as good as you would expect. A little over the top in some moments but the whole movie goes a little over the top in many moments. And Pacino is very good in the quieter moments such as heart-to-hearts with his two quarterbacks, the aging star and the young hotshot. Speaking of that young hotshot Jamie Foxx plays Beamen and captures all the character's excesses wonderfully while also conveying the hurt and frustration of a guy who never felt he was given a fair shot in football or in life. It's Pacino and Foxx who really have to carry the movie and they do a very good job of it. But they have plenty of support. Diaz is surprisingly effective in a role which certainly does not seem tailor-made for her. Dennis Quaid, James Woods, Matthew Modine, Aaron Eckhart, Ann-Margret...the list goes on and on. Notable performers who all add something to the film. There's also room for real-life football stars. Jim Brown we already knew could act. Lawrence Taylor is a pleasant surprise. He plays an old, broken-down linebacker facing the end of his career and his own personal demons. So basically, LT's playing himself. And he handles that very well.So the cast is generally excellent and the story's entertaining enough so why is there the nagging sense that the movie's not quite as good as it could have been? One problem is the football action. Stone takes you right onto the field, capturing the sound and fury. But he goes too far. Realism takes a back seat as we're presented with a lot of rather cartoonish football, guys doing full-twisting double somersaults into the end zone and such. The game is exciting enough as is, Stone didn't need to crank it up past the point of truth. And a lot of the off the field stuff goes a little too far as well. There's a lot of craziness and excess. Our on-field warriors are wild men off the field. A little too wild at times to take the movie seriously. And then there's the central plot point, Beamen's rise to instant superstardom. The media makes stars quickly but not that quickly. It's just not really believable. Coach D'Amato tells us football is a game of grabbing that last inch. Any Given Sunday comes close but when we stretch out the chains it comes up just that inch short.",6,1,1,23 September 2011
Bruce Almighty," God is a funny guy
","Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck Buffalo TV reporter for whom things just never seem to go right. Soon after we meet him Bruce is passed over for the big promotion to the anchor desk. He reacts...poorly. And gets himself fired. Who does Bruce blame for this latest misfortune? God. Well, God isn't going to take that lying down. God summons Bruce to an empty warehouse. Hey, if you're God where else would you rather hang out than an empty warehouse in Buffalo? Anyhow Bruce doesn't particularly believe the strange man he meets in the warehouse is God. But God has his ways of convincing Bruce. Turns out God is a bit of a showoff when it comes to using his powers. And now he is going to give those powers to Bruce. If Bruce thought God was doing a bad job well here's his chance to prove he can do it better.So being given all of God's powers seems like a pretty good deal. And Bruce wastes no time putting those powers to good use. He is able to impress his girlfriend in all sorts of ways. He's able to sabotage his rival and get that anchor job he so coveted. He's even able to get his dog to stop peeing on the furniture. All well and good but all these things he's doing are just for his own personal benefit. When you're God you have to look out for everyone. There are a lot of prayers out there waiting to be answered. Bruce is more than a tad overwhelmed and inevitably he makes a mess of things. And that mess extends to his personal life. Issues with the girlfriend arise. Well that's easy to solve when you're God, just snap your fingers and make her love you again right? Nope, not even God can mess with free will. Turns out being God is no fun if you've lost the love of your life.As with any Jim Carrey comedy there are plenty of antics from the star. Nothing over-the-top though. And, it must be said, nothing that's really outrageously funny either. This is an amusing movie but not a hilarious one. But what it may lack in huge laughs it makes up for with charm. Carrey is very endearing. Jennifer Aniston does well with the role of Bruce's girlfriend, Grace. Aniston doesn't get many chances to showcase her comedy chops, those moments are pretty much reserved for Carrey. But she's so charming, eminently lovable. And Morgan Freeman is the perfect God. Sly, witty, but with the sense of authority required of someone who is, you know, God. Maybe Bruce Almighty could have been just a touch funnier. Maybe the movie lays it on a bit thick with its efforts to show that Bruce has really learned something. Most people aren't looking for life lessons with their comedy. But the movie does have significant charms. Bruce Nolan is a guy worth rooting for. The love he has with Grace is worth fighting for. And his attempts to play God are worth enough laughs to enable this movie to succeed.",7,2,2,6 August 2014
Ben-Hur," Perhaps too epic for its own good
","We begin with the birth of Jesus. And then we leave Jesus behind as we spend three and a half hours following the story of Judah Ben-Hur. Subtitle notwithstanding this is not 'A Tale of the Christ'. Oh Jesus pops up now and again for a few brief moments. But this is a tale of Ben-Hur. So who is this Ben-Hur fellow? Well he's a man whose life's journey goes something along the lines of wealthy Jew in Jerusalem turned galley slave turned adopted son of Roman nobleman turned champion chariot racer. Well that certainly sounds like an exciting life. But the way the story is presented doesn't make for a particularly exciting movie. This movie is quite a slog. 212 long, long, long minutes. And the sad reality is it didn't have to be this way. The movie could have so easily been streamlined to great effect. So many scenes that go on so much longer than they have to. So much time utterly wasted. This movie could have clocked in at two and a half hours without losing anything important. Instead what we get is a potentially fascinating story which, in the way it is told, ends up being somewhat monotonous. There are good reasons nobody makes three-plus hour biblical epics anymore.This is a movie which has its moments but there is a lot of tedium along the way. The most famous sequence is of course the undeniably exciting chariot race. But even that scene serves as an example of the ways in which the movie goes wrong. The race itself is a little long but we can forgive that as by this point in the story we're looking for all the excitement we can get. But the wait for the race to actually start is interminable. The buildup as we wait for the chariots to get to the starting line goes on forever and a day. Just the most obvious example of a sequence which serves no purpose other than to bring the film's momentum to an abrupt halt. Honestly, was director William Wyler being paid by the minute? This movie screams out for an editor with the freedom to slice and dice this thing down to size. But alas that was not to be.I suppose one has to make allowances for the time in which a movie is made. Ben-Hur clearly is a film with a style which plays much better in 1959 than it does today. It's big and grand and epic. But in so many ways too big and grand and epic for its own good. It certainly looks spectacular, making it easy to see how awards for cinematography, costume design and set decoration were among the slew of Oscars which came this film's way. It's understandable that Charlton Heston would get an Oscar for his challenging task of carrying the film over it's endless running time. I'm still trying to figure out what Hugh Griffith did to get a supporting actor Oscar though. You can see how the pieces were there to make a potentially great film. And you can see why upon its initial release it was in fact lauded as a great film. But it's not 1959 anymore. Time has been less kind to this 'great film' than others of its period. In the end the movie suffers because it refuses to end. On and on and on it goes. Brief moments of excitement, long stretches of boredom. Even after the great climax of the chariot race the movie just won't stop. We get a good old-fashioned leprosy storyline which is about as appealing and entertaining as you would imagine it to be. And finally, and I do mean finally, Jesus shows up again to bookend the proceedings. No prizes for guessing how the Jesus story turns out. As for the Ben-Hur story it's one which had the potential to entertain and inspire. But the story's impact is dulled by the way in which it was told. It's a self-important epic which is too darned epic.",6,17,41,29 July 2010
Casino Royale," Certainly over-hyped but still rather enjoyable
","The relentless hype machine would have you believe that Daniel Craig is 'The best Bond ever!' and that Casino Royale is the film that 'saves the Bond franchise!' None of that may be particularly true. The Bond franchise may have needed a little tweaking and updating but it certainly didn't need to be saved. And while Craig is very good in the role can we let him do more than one of these before we dismiss all who came before? But once you get past all the breathless hype you do have a very good film.Casino Royale is, at least compared with the slew of films which preceded it, a serious James Bond movie, if there can be such a thing. Many of the Bond films have been overly campy and at times ridiculously over the top. Not here. This is a much more grounded film and the new tone works wonderfully. This movie actually seems believable. Even the action scenes, which in many Bond films were ludicrously impossible, ring true. You get the sense that this stuff could actually happen which is refreshing. And happily, the film is less about action and more about plot, about engaging characters and the dramatic situations they find themselves in. Yes, this Bond film goes in a different direction and it pays off.Now, for all the positives this is certainly not a perfect film. It definitely drags at times and probably would have benefited from some scenes being left on the cutting room floor. A poker game that takes up a rather healthy chunk of the film's running time is certainly vital to the plot but definitely slows things down. But, as a whole, the film works. The film certainly looks terrific with the visuals as stunning as you would expect from the Bond franchise. The key roles are all performed well. Craig may not be the best Bond ever, at least not yet, but he is certainly very good, entirely believable in all aspects of the role. As always, this Bond movie comes with plenty of villains but Mads Mikkelsen is the key bad guy and his performance is terrific. Appropriately menacing and much more believable than many prior Bond villains. As the requisite Bond girl, Eva Green may not be quite as good here as Craig and Mikkelsen but she holds her own. You get the sense Green and Craig could have had a little better chemistry but it's a minor quibble. In the end, everything comes together rather nicely. The story, while a little slow moving at times, does hold your attention and ultimately goes off in some surprising directions. Add in the fine acting performances, the great visuals, some riveting action and you have a film that's definitely worth your while. Maybe not an all-time classic but a very good film which makes you anxious to see where Bond goes from here.",7,1,3,17 August 2007
Toy Story 3," It's been a great ride
","An animated movie about plastic toys really shouldn't make a grown man cry. But with Toy Story 3 the good folks at Pixar make that possible. Your level of weepiness may vary but if this film's final act doesn't at least induce a sniffle or two you may want to place your hand on your chest to make sure that you do actually have a heart. A three-film journey is complete and what a ride it's been. And after three films full of great entertainment, adventure, comedy and thrills the saga of our favorite plastic playthings ends with some raw, heartfelt emotion. It's hard to say goodbye to our toys.In many ways you know going in what you're going to get from a Toy Story film. First off, you know it's going to look fantastic. The animation revolution which the first Toy Story film began is in full bloom now. There's some truly breathtaking looking stuff. You'll hear that familiar and beloved song, You've Got a Friend in Me, with a new twist and Randy Newman will have some great new music for you too. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen will once again brilliantly bring our heroes, Woody and Buzz, to life. And most of your other old favorite voices will be back too. Could we really have a Toy Story movie without Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Wallace Shawn as Rex or John Ratzenberger as Hamm? Of course new friends introduced into the Toy Story universe in Toy Story 2 will be back as well, notably Joan Cusack's Jessie, Jodi Benson's Barbie and Estelle Harris's Mrs. Potato Head. And then you toss in the new toys. There are some real gems in the new bunch. Ned Beatty has the most significant new role, that of Lotso the hugging bear. Timothy Dalton is a treat as thespian hedgehog Mr. Pricklepants. And Barbie needs her Ken. Enter Michael Keaton who is perfect in the role of the guy who, despite all his protestations, is totally a girl's toy.So the gang's all here, old friends and new. The story begins with Andy, owner of all our favorite toys, now grown up and about to head off to college. The toys end up, after a few misunderstandings and contrivances, being donated to a daycare center. Most of the toys seem happy with their new fate. But ever-loyal Woody knows he must get back to Andy. And the rest of the toys soon get a cold splash of reality. Life at Sunnyside daycare isn't so sunny after all. They've gotta get out. In Toy Story 2 the other toys set out to rescue Woody. This time Woody sets out to rescue the other toys. There are moments where it does seem a little too familiar and repetitive. But there are more than enough great moments, and certainly enough great characters, to keep the movie chugging along. And ultimately there will be great drama, danger and peril. Forget little kids, even adults might be covering their eyes. There's a lot of scary stuff our beloved toys go through. Amazingly this animated movie about a bunch of toys manages to put your heart right in your throat. A wonderfully exciting climax to this great three-movie ride. And then, right at the end, the serious heartstring-tugging begins. A beautiful, heartfelt, poignant end to the great Toy Story saga. A terrific and fitting ending which, over the course of three beloved films, these toys and the Pixar geniuses who created them have certainly earned.",8,0,0,30 May 2011
Bull Durham," The Church of Baseball
","Annie Savoy is a spiritual woman. Her religion is baseball. Every year she shares her spirituality, and her body, with one member of the hometown minor-league Durham Bulls. But this year Annie has a dilemma. She can't decide who this year's lover should be, wise old veteran catcher Crash Davis or hotshot rookie pitcher, and total rube, Nuke LaLoosh. Complicating matters is that Crash has been sent down to lowly single-A Durham for the sole purpose of grooming Nuke, the organization's golden child. But Crash quickly uncomplicates things by saying he's a veteran who's not going to try out to be Annie's fling of the year. With a memorable speech about what he believes in Crash leaves Annie with Nuke. He also leaves her very much pining for him.So Annie embarks on her relationship with Nuke. She tries to give him a little bit of wisdom and spirituality. His interest in her does not seem to extend outside of bedroom activities. All the while Annie keeps a watchful eye on Crash. It's fairly obvious that Annie and Crash would make for a much better match than Annie and the hopelessly immature Nuke. But Crash keeps his distance. And meanwhile there's a baseball season to be played. And unlike so many sports movies this one gets the sports part right. It's a great depiction of minor-league life. Smart, quirky, often funny, always honest. It's very easy to buy into these Durham Bulls. These guys actually seem like a real team, with all the ups and downs of a season and all the complicated relationships a real team has. The movie focuses on Crash and Nuke but we get to know enough about the other players, and the coaches, to care about them too. This is the rare sports movie where the sports totally rings true. It feels real. But that doesn't mean it can't be funny too. Ever wonder what gets discussed during those interminable conferences on the pitching mound? This movie has a funny answer. There's nothing in the movie that will make you bust a gut laughing but there's plenty of subtle, smart humor to bring a smile to your face.The movie is definitely helped by some pitch-perfect casting. Kevin Costner is superb as the worn-down, but wonderfully wise, veteran Crash. Tim Robbins is a hoot as cocky, flighty, silly Nuke. And Susan Sarandon is the perfect high priestess in the Church of Baseball. Her Annie Savoy is mature and worldly and fascinating enough to entice a man like Crash. And sexy enough to rope in young buck Nuke. Seeing Annie open herself up to the possibility of a real relationship, not her typical fleeting fling, is some of the best stuff the movie has to offer and Sarandon nails that change in the character wonderfully. Of course that change won't come easy. She may want to be with Crash but she's actually with Nuke and baseball keeps getting in the way. The relationship between Crash and Nuke will prove to be as important as any of Annie's entanglements. The old vet has to prepare the young star for life in the big leagues. But when the job is done, when Crash has done all he can to shape Nuke into the player and man he can be, then what? What use is there for Crash then? A sobering thought. Crash has led a terrific, albeit obscure, baseball life. What will that get him in the end? Annie has loved many a player in her own unique way and then sent them along up the baseball chain. Is it time to stop that particular cycle of life? And Nuke? Well, he's gonna announce his presence, bring the heat. And they all lived happily ever after? Who knows? The joy of Bull Durham is in embracing the possibility. This is a movie which gives us such great characters. And puts those characters to very entertaining use, making us smile and laugh but also making us care. A home run.",8,0,0,2 September 2012
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Uneven, ultimately disappointing
","Vicky is a prim, proper, practical woman. She is engaged to the type of man prim, proper, practical women marry. Vicky's friend Cristina is everything Vicky is not. Adventurous, spontaneous and quite willing to hop into bed with some random man she just met. Vicky knows what she wants in life. Cristina is searching. The two friends are spending the summer in Barcelona. Artist Juan Antonio, of whom Vicky and Cristina know nothing other than he tried to kill his ex-wife (or maybe the other way around), introduces himself and suggests the three of them fly off to Oviedo for a weekend of sightseeing and sex. Mostly sex. Vicky is of course appalled. Cristina is of course intrigued. Off to Oviedo the threesome goes, Vicky only agreeing to go along to keep an eye on Cristina. And then things get complicated.Woody Allen has set up an interesting situation here but the film doesn't live up to its initial promise. Ultimately it is quite a letdown. This seems like a story which should be full of emotion but the movie is oddly flat. The performances of the leads don't help. Scarlett Johansson, playing Cristina, is a blank slate in desperate need of some color. She's quite dull. Rebecca Hall, playing Vicky, comes across somewhat better. It is really left to Penélope Cruz, playing a prototypical Spanish firecracker, to inject some life into the proceedings. The movie noticeably perks up when Cruz is on the screen. Her scenes with Javier Bardem, playing Juan Antonio, have some sizzle to them, a notable contrast to Bardem's interactions with the film's other leading ladies. Cruz brings good energy but not nearly enough to rescue what is all in all a rather boring movie.While not a total misfire Vicky Cristina Barcelona has too many flaws to be deemed a success. The dialogue is rather pretentious. There is an incredibly annoying narrator who just never shuts up. The story, which seemed to have great promise, ends up falling rather flat. Some of the key performances fail to engage. And in the end it all seems rather pointless, there is no satisfying resolution whatsoever. Cruz and Bardem work well together. Unfortunately that which surrounds them disappoints. You can see potential in this movie. But Allen was unable to put the pieces together properly. One of those frustrating movies which you can't help but feel should be much better than it actually is.",5,1,4,18 August 2015
Beowulf," Well, it certainly looks nice
","Here we have a film which is a triumph of animation. Unfortunately it is not a triumph of storytelling. The animation is so good, often eerily lifelike, that it is almost worth seeing the film for that reason alone. But be forewarned that in order to see all the impressive visuals you're going to have to sit through a story which fails to engage. And if you're a Beowulf purist, because I'm sure there is such a thing, be prepared to be disappointed as this film version of the story strays in very significant ways from the original text. I suppose it's understandable that the filmmakers would find it necessary to jazz up such an ancient story for a modern audience. But so many of the changes seem pointless and any attempt to liven things up seems to have failed because, at least as it is presented in this film, the story of Beowulf is a rather dull one. All the eye-catching animation can't hide the fact that this story really drags.Despite the failings of the story, it must be said that there are some fine performances in this film, although seeing as the actors are not actually 'there' on the screen, it's a whole different kind of performance than we're used to. But the king Hrothgar sure looks and sounds like Anthony Hopkins, now doesn't he? And hey, isn't that Brendan Gleeson? And Robin Wright Penn? And Angelina Jolie, only all painted up gold and with high-heeled feet? Hopkins and Gleeson and all the others do a fine job of bringing their not-quite-real versions of themselves to life. As Beowulf himself, Ray Winstone may look less like himself than the others but his performance is fine as well. And a special mention for Crispin Glover, who I am fairly certain is not in fact a giant, hideous monster in real life but who here does a good job giving some life and personality to the monster Grendel. But still, despite the impressive cast and the impressive way that cast is brought to animated life, the film really doesn't work. The story fails to take off and for much too much of the time we're left just biding time until the next admittedly visually stunning battle scene. For all the obvious effort that went into the animation you'll end up wishing a little more attention had been paid to the story itself. The story is where this movie fails.",4,9,17,30 November 2007
Amélie," Charming. But not THAT charming.
","Amélie is a playful, whimsical film, very quirky. Maybe a little too quirky for its own good. It has acquired a reputation as being among the most charming and inspiring films ever. That is overselling things quite a bit. Yes, the movie has its charms. It will probably leave you with a smile on your face. But the truth is it's just a cute little film, a pleasant diversion but really nothing more than that. Audrey Tautou does an excellent job in portraying the title character, it's easy to fall in love with Amélie Poulain. But this young woman will frustrate you too. She sets out to do good, to bring happiness to others. That's nice. But she goes about it in such a roundabout way, nothing is ever straightforward. At times you really do wish the character, and the film, would just get on with it. Amélie doing things in her own very unique way is what gives the film much of its charm. But there comes a point where it's all a bit much.Amélie Poulain had a very sheltered childhood, she had no friends and unsurprisingly that has made her into a very socially awkward woman. She finds a man she might be interested in but is way too frightened to even introduce herself to him. Instead she concocts an elaborate scheme to make a tenuous connection with him. If there is one thing Amélie is good at it's concocting elaborate schemes. But will she ever overcome her fears and embrace the possibilities of love? Who knows? In the meantime she'll help others, spreading happiness the way only she can. The whole thing is very sweet, to the point the film almost drowns in sweetness. Tautou charms you all the way through but, charming though she is, she can't prevent the film from getting bogged down a bit. As Amélie's schemes play themselves out you get the sense the film is going in circles, not moving forward. It is a film of great imagination but imagination can only carry a film so far. There's not quite enough substance to pay off all the imagination. It all adds up to a reasonably entertaining, charming film. Not one of the most charming films ever, certainly not one of the most inspiring. But a film that should leave you feeling at the very least happy that you've seen it.",6,0,2,27 May 2014
The Producers," Springtime For Mel Brooks
","For Mel Brooks, The Producers is the gift that keeps on giving. The film, the Broadway musical based on the film, the second film based on the Broadway musical...maybe you can make more money with a flop than with a hit but I'm sure Brooks has done just fine for himself with The Producers. And this is certainly no flop.A plot summary seems rather unnecessary as most everyone should be familiar with the story. And the story is really secondary anyway, there really only to set up a succession of jokes, sight gags and one outrageously funny, utterly brilliant musical number. The film is not always uproariously funny. For much of its running time it inspires mild chuckles rather than gut-busting laughs. It's a movie that certainly has its moments but it is not consistently hilarious. But just when you think this might be just another reasonably amusing comedy it happens. 'Springtime for Hitler.' The musical number so perfect, so outrageous, so impossibly funny that it elevates the movie as a whole. In this moment everything comes together and the comic payoff is priceless.Some of the jokes and gags do fall a little flat but overall the film always manages to be entertaining. The cast is terrific. If it is true that opposites attract Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder could not be any more perfect in their roles as Max and Leo, the producers themselves. The bombastic Mostel and jittery Wilder play off one another brilliantly. They are the two central characters but they are surrounded by a terrific ensemble which really brings the lunacy of Mel Brooks to life. Kenneth Mars as a deranged Nazi playwright, Christopher Hewett as a ludicrously flamboyant Broadway director and Dick Shawn as a hippie Hitler are among the standouts. And while her screen time is minimal Lee Meredith is an absolute treat in the role of Ulla, Max's Swedish receptionist. Ulla may not be much of a receptionist but she sure is fun to watch. In the end The Producers is a real treat. Other movies may be more consistently funny but this one is certainly funny enough. And it has that one transcendent moment which is simply as good as film comedy gets. Well done Mel Brooks. Turns out you can make plenty of money with a hit.",7,2,3,2 January 2009
Casino," GoodFellas in Vegas...it was better in New York
","Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a GoodFellas rehash. Casino is not a bad film. But it pales in comparison to what has come before it. It would be much easier to applaud Casino if we could take it on its own merits. But the parallels to GoodFellas are so numerous and so obvious, Casino always leaves us wanting more. We've seen this all before and we've seen it done better.Casino starts quite literally with a bang with a rather shocking car bombing before the opening titles have even rolled. It's a fascinating and highly intriguing opening but Casino never is able to sustain that energy. The film slogs along for three hours with the pace so slow that at times the movie seems to come to a dead stop. Scorsese has, even in his most brilliant successes, been criticized for the pacing (or lack thereof) in his films. Casino is a prime example of a Scorsese film that would have benefited greatly if the action could have been pushed along just a little bit faster. There's a terrific story here, top-notch acting performances and the typically brilliant Scorsese visual touches. What's missing is the energy a film like GoodFellas had. For all that Casino has going for it, in the end it's simply not entertaining enough.After the shock of the opening sequence, Casino goes back in time ten years to tell the story of Ace Rothstein, as played by Robert De Niro. We see he is running, on behalf of Midwestern mob bosses, the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas. Through use of voice-over narration (a la Goodfellas) Rothstein, and later Joe Pesci's Nicky Santoro, explain how the money moves through the casino and into the hands of the mafia kingpins. As the story begins everybody's getting paid, everything's running smoothly, everybody's happy. When mafia tough guy Santoro, played wonderfully by Pesci who could do this type of thing in his sleep, takes up residence in Vegas things start to unravel. Santoro's a hothead, out to make a quick buck for himself. Where Rothstein had been free to operate his casino in peace, when Santoro starts stirring things up he brings unwanted attention from the authorities. Rothstein's wife, Ginger, is not helping matters by being constantly drunk, stoned or drunk and stoned. Sharon Stone plays Ginger and the character is such a train wreck it's hard to really evaluate Stone's performance. She's certainly convincing as a glamorous call girl early on, perhaps less convincing when she's forced to be hysterically screaming all the time.Anyhow, Ace ends up having problems with the wife, problems with the authorities and problems with his onetime good friend Nicky. It's fascinating to see all the conflict swirl around him and De Niro is reliably brilliant in his performance as he deals with all the madness around him. Pesci is terrific and Stone is OK. Actors playing smaller roles also do noteworthy work. James Woods does well in a bit part as a man who is part of Ginger's past. Frank Vincent (GoodFellas parallel number 8,362 or thereabouts) settles into his mobster's role quite easily. And Don Rickles and Dick Smothers of all people have serious parts to play and each does a fine job. So, the acting certainly isn't the problem. The main characters, and some of the secondary ones, are wonderfully developed. Casino is beautifully photographed as you would expect from Scorsese. And the story is a good one, intriguing from beginning to end. It's in that long journey from beginning to end where Casino stumbles somewhat. It just takes too long to get where we're going and the film can't sustain the energy it opened with. A fascinating story, but in the end one that with a better pace could have been told in a much more entertaining way.",6,6,11,1 July 2005
Heat," Too much Heat
","There's a potentially great two hour movie in here someplace. Unfortunately the reality is what we have here is a mediocre three hour movie. So many scenes which could have, and should have, been cut. So many characters that are so woefully underdeveloped they serve no purpose at all and end up just taking up space. And taking up time, lots and lots of time. There are certainly some exciting and fascinating sequences but in too many places the film just slogs along with nothing of any significance whatsoever occurring. Ultimately Heat frustrates because you see what it could have been. It has a terrific cast and what should have been a terrific story if only it was told better.Of course the vast majority of hype which surrounded Heat concerned the two lead actors. Robert De Niro plays Neil McCauley, who leads a group of professional thieves in Los Angeles. Al Pacino plays Vincent Hanna who is the lead investigator on McCauley's trail. De Niro's performance is reliably brilliant. He is undoubtedly the best thing this move has to offer. He shows how subtlety can be a great asset for an actor, something Pacino apparently forgot somewhere along the way. Pacino's Vincent is a guy who goes through life screaming things at the top of his lungs for no good reason and this act gets really tired really quickly. Perhaps not coincidentally the only time in the whole film that Pacino comes back down to Earth is when he's seated across a table from De Niro. Robert De Niro, a calming influence? Who'd have ever thought it? The rest of the cast is littered with big names who have nothing much to do besides watch De Niro scheme and Pacino scream. Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Amy Brenneman, Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria...they're all here. But we never really get to know much of anything about their characters. It's De Niro and Pacino, Pacino and De Niro, all the time. Whenever De Niro or Pacino isn't on the screen it feels as if the movie is just killing time. When these other lesser characters see their respective stories ultimately play out it's hard not to think, 'OK, whatever, I don't really care what happened to them anyway. What are De Niro and Pacino up to?' From its beginning, through its slow, plodding middle and all the way up to its inevitable conclusion Heat is all about Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Maybe if Pacino could have toned down his act and the film didn't take so long to get where you know it was going all along, that wouldn't have been such a bad thing.",5,4,9,13 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Epic in every way
","A classic story with a perfect cast, memorable score and dazzling special effects. Movies don't get any better than this. More space opera than true sci-fi, Star Wars takes you on a magical ride through a galaxy far, far away.The first moment of genius comes right at the very start with a written crawl which gives a basic plot outline and without which all that immediately followed would be hard to place in context. After John Williams' now legendary opening theme we are thrust into the first of many thrilling space battles to come. Almost immediately we are introduced to one of the great movie villains of all time, Darth Vader who is voiced with true menace by James Earl Jones, and it becomes clear that this film is not quite like anything we have seen before.Star Wars may seem to be your typical good versus evil swashbuckling adventure but there's a lot more going on here. The hero, Luke Skywalker, is your typical simple, clean-cut farm boy who will soon be thrust into the middle of a galactic war of as grand a scale as could be imagined. But he is not our only hero. Princess Leia, a leader of the rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire, is certainly not your typical helpless fairy-tale princess. She gives as good as she gets. Obi-Wan Kenobi is the older, wiser more seasoned hero and the mentor young Luke will desperately need. Han Solo is a space pirate in it only for the money, not for any revolution. Solo's first mate aboard his ship, the Milennium Falcon, is Chewbacca, a giant Wookiee who is remarkably adept at space flight for a creature which resembles a hairy two-legged dog. Also along for the ride to help our heroes are the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 who provide not only critical help for our heroes but some comic relief for the audience.The performances in Star Wars are all first-rate. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker plays the young, naive Skywalker very well and Hamill grows right along with the character throughout the film. Carrie Fisher brings the appropriate smarts, skills, sophistication and determination to Princess Leia. Without Fisher's quality performance it might be hard to believe that this young woman could play such a pivotal role in a rebellion of this magnitude. Alec Guinness is reliably brilliant as old Jedi master Kenobi. He is mysterious, quiet and reserved yet very strong indeed. Stealing the show is Harrison Ford as Han Solo. It seems Ford gets all the best lines and he makes the most of them. Luke Skywalker may be the nominal hero of the film but it is Ford as Solo from which Star Wars gets most of its personality.George Lucas has crafted a true masterpiece here. The classic struggle of the underdog against the evil oppressor takes on many new twists here. The mysterious Force, the foreboding and menacing Darth Vader, alien creatures of all imaginable shapes and sizes, the epic nature of a battle which rages across an entire galaxy...in the end it all comes together to form something unique and truly wonderful. With action and adventure on a grand scale, fascinating characters on both sides of the fight, special effects that were revolutionary for the time and an ever-building sense of drama and excitement Star Wars is an absolute triumph.",10,5,7,25 May 2005
Easy A," Maybe not quite an A. But a solid B+
","High school is a weird time in a person's life. And it's about to get a whole lot weirder for Olive Penderghast. Olive is a nice, if rather anonymous, girl. She's not popular. She's not unpopular. She's just there, pretty much invisible. Then, in the interest of shutting up her somewhat annoying best friend, Olive makes up a story about having lost her virginity to some college guy. Unfortunately this phony confession is overheard by Marianne, leader of the pack among the school's group of young religious zealots. Marianne spreads the word all over the school. Olive isn't anonymous anymore. Everybody all of a sudden is very interested in her. She uses her newfound notoriety to help out her gay friend Brandon, pretending to sleep with him so he will be accepted by his peers. This works for Brandon, but not so much for Olive, furthering her reputation as a dirty slut. At this point Olive decides to go all-in, fully embracing her new image as the school's resident tramp. And this makes for a pretty fun movie.Easy A is an homage to all those teen comedies of the 1980s we know so well. This movie may not be quite as good as those other movies it pays tribute to. But it's certainly good enough to provide some solid entertainment. The best thing this movie has going for it is Emma Stone who is absolutely fabulous in the role of Olive. Olive is a smart, charming, witty, endearing girl and Stone brings all of that out wonderfully. It's a star-making performance. The movie doesn't have very many huge laughs but it has its amusing comic moments and Stone nails each and every one of those moments. What the movie may lack in big laughs it makes up for with smarts. It's a very well thought-out movie, scripted with a structure that really works in delivering the story in the best possible way. It's a very simple story but the way it is laid out makes it work well. And while Stone is clearly the star, and weighted with carrying the film on her shoulders, the supporting cast adds a great deal to the proceedings as well. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci are terrific in playing Olive's exceedingly quirky parents. Thomas Haden Church plays one of Olive's teachers in a way that makes it very easy to see why he is Olive's favorite. And all of the younger performers fall comfortably into their roles as well with Amanda Bynes making a particularly good impression in the important role of God-loving Marianne, a great antagonist for Olive.This movie takes Olive on quite a strange trip. Once she starts down the path of fake whoring there's the sense she may not quite understand what she's getting herself into. Things could get rather messy. But you always believe she'll be resourceful enough to extricate herself from whatever messes she may create. And you'll definitely be rooting for her to do so. Olive is a character who is very easy to love, full credit to Stone for making that so. Olive's smart and very charming. And so is the movie. Yes, it could stand to be a touch funnier. But there are enough laughs here to satisfy. Easy A definitely makes the grade.",7,1,1,28 August 2014
Apollo 13," A most thrilling ride
","If you have even the remotest knowledge of history you know how Apollo 13, based as it is on a true story, will turn out. And yet the film is filled with a tremendous sense of drama, placing you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Being able to wring that much drama out a of a film which you might expect to have a sense of inevitability about it is a tremendous achievement. Full credit to director Ron Howard and his brilliant ensemble cast of wonderfully talented performers.Apollo 13 tells the story of a 1970 American space mission gone terribly wrong. The crew of Apollo 13 was headed to the moon which sounds exciting but at the time nobody in America seemed to really care. The general public now saw space travel as routine and the sense of wonder had been lost. A successful mission would have been barely noted by the American people. It took a potential disaster to capture their interest and the story as it is told here will certainly grab hold of you as well.When their spaceship is crippled by a potentially catastrophic failure the crew of Apollo 13 is facing seemingly insurmountable odds in its quest to safely return home to Earth. This film brilliantly captures the hardships the crew had to endure and the bravery and grace under pressure they exhibited. The film also shows the heroic efforts of the men on the ground who attempted to devise a way to bring the crippled ship home. All of the key roles are performed wonderfully. As the central figure in the drama, spaceship commander Jim Lovell, Tom Hanks is reliably brilliant. Lovell had to be a real leader and it's a role which fits Hanks perfectly. Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton portray the other two astronauts aboard the ship and each has his moments of brilliance as well. Gary Sinise has a key role as Ken Mattingly, an astronaut originally scheduled to be on the fateful mission who now does all he can from his spot on the ground to help bring his comrades home. Aside from Hanks probably the best performance is by Ed Harris as the man in charge on the ground, the resolute, confident, unwavering Flight Director Gene Kranz. Harris does a great job of bringing this character to life, inspiring you to believe that the seemingly impossible is possible after all.While the film, quite literally, takes a little while to get off the ground, once the spacecraft takes off Apollo 13 is an absolutely thrilling journey. It is wonderfully acted, beautifully photographed and packed with drama. Even if you know what's coming you can't help but be swept up by an immense wave of emotion. Given the benefit of a great story to work with Ron Howard delivers a masterpiece. Brilliantly done.",9,2,4,14 October 2005
The Great Escape," How great was that escape?
","There's one thing you have to ask yourself about The Great Escape. That is whether that escape actually was so great. Was all the effort worth it? The film tells the more or less true story of British prisoners in a World War II German POW camp. The prisoners considered it their duty to try and escape, to confound and harass the enemy. But what would it take to consider the operation a success? The plan was to bust out 250 prisoners. Sounds great. But it wasn't as simple as digging a tunnel and popping up on the other side of the fence a free man. Once you exit the tunnel you're in Nazi Germany with the Gestapo hot on your heels. For all the incredibly hard work that went into the digging of the tunnel getting out of the camp was always going to be the easy part. Getting out of Germany was the hard part. And for all the meticulous planning that went into that part of the operation there was always the sense that might be a hill too high to climb. And if that effort failed the consequences would be dire. Was it all worth it? Was it really such a great escape after all? For as much as the men found it their duty to attempt to escape the fact was that they weren't really that bad off as prisoners. The camp in which they were imprisoned was not the typical Nazi house of horrors you would expect. The prisoners were actually treated pretty well. The camp commandant seemed rather sympathetic to their plight. Should they escape the Gestapo who would be responsible for hunting them down would be much less sympathetic. But escape they must decide the prisoners. And thus begins a rather incredible effort. It's so much more than digging a tunnel. Everyone had a job to do and everyone did it well. You can question whether the prisoners really should have tried to escape in the first place but there is no denying that once they set their mind to it the effort they put in was remarkable. It was always going to be an overly ambitious plan. 250 men coming out of the tunnel and finding their way to freedom? Never going to happen. What would constitute success? Everyone can have their own opinion on that. But it is hard to see how whatever could be gained was worth what in the end could be lost.So maybe the escape itself wasn't as great as we, or certainly the escapees themselves, would have hoped. But what about the movie? Again, a noble effort but not as great as you'd hope. One problem comes with Hollywood getting its hands on a true-life story and changing it to suit the needs of Hollywood. Enter Steve McQueen because an American audience demands an American star. Even if in the true story there really was no such person as McQueen's Captain Hilts. Even if in the real history all the Americans had already been moved out of the camp by the time the escape happened, let's send James Garner through the tunnel too. Garner's character at least blends into the story well. McQueen on the other hand seems to be acting in his own little movie. All the effort to give the big American star something to do, to give him some big dramatic moments detracts from the film. The character of Hilts is portrayed as the big hero. The real heroes of the story get the short shrift. Richard Attenborough, playing the leader of the escape efforts, gets plenty of screen time. But so many other characters who seemingly had a lot to offer get pushed into the background as the Steve McQueen show plays out. A shame. It's not that McQueen gives a bad performance because he surely doesn't. It's just that his character was forced into the movie and never quite fits. Not to mention the fact that all the time spent with McQueen stretches out the running time of an already notably long film. With all that went into the preparations for the escape this was always going to be a long one. Toss the character of Hilts into the mix and you've got a movie which goes on so long that it often struggles to maintain its momentum. But at least you know you have the escape to look forward to and when it comes it is undeniably dramatic. And then the tension really kicks in. What will be the ultimate fate for all of these brave men? The movie's ending packs an emotional wallop. Ultimately, and unfortunately, it comes back to McQueen. He gets the show-off motorcycle ride he demanded. And his character gets the last word so to speak. Which is a shame because the real story provided more than enough real heroes to choose from. Add it all up and this is a movie which had the potential to be great. But it comes up a few yards short.",6,3,10,20 December 2011
Click," Adam can act
","It's not the typical Adam Sandler movie and thank goodness for that. This movie has some actual drama, some real heart to it. It's not all lowbrow toilet humor. Has Adam Sandler grown up? Even in this more grownup venture he apparently just couldn't help himself, tossing in the obligatory disgusting fart joke. But we'll give him a a pass on that one because pretty much everything else in the movie shows a refreshing maturity. Well, OK maybe not the humping dogs. But what do you want? Sandler's never going to go full-blown serious dramatist and who'd want him to? This movie maintains the humor Sandler is known for but also gives you a story you actually care about and moments of great emotion and poignancy. Along the way Sandler gets to show that he does have some actual serious acting chops. One scene with him and his father, played by Henry Winkler, particularly stands out. Here Sandler's character has so much emotion coursing through him. And Sandler performs the scene so well you feel the emotion right along with him. Very well done, and more than a little surprising from an actor who is not known for this sort of thing.The story revolves around Sandler's character of Michael, an overworked architect whose family takes a backseat in his quest for career advancement. He loves his family, he just doesn't have the time for them. Then he meets Morty, a mysterious man who bestows upon Michael a gift which will make things so much simpler. It's a universal remote which actually control's Michael's universe. Now he's got all the time he needs. He can pause, rewind, fast forward. But inevitably there will be complications. Michael ends up fast forwarding through his whole life. He misses everything. And he gets really, really fat. It seems in order to really appreciate life Michael had to miss it. Can he get it back? According to Morty that's not part of the deal.Those expecting a straight comedy are going to be very surprised with Click, but probably pleasantly so. There are plenty of laughs but nothing that's really uproariously funny. And most of the comedy is shoehorned into the first half of the film. The second half takes on a more serious, at times even somber, tone. A somber Adam Sandler movie? Who wants to watch that? You should. Sandler breaks out of the little box that is his admittedly wildly successful career to try something a little bit different and it pays off. Sandler is really terrific in this. And he's got great support from the rest of the cast, most notably the always reliably brilliant Christopher Walken playing the eccentric Morty. Not everything in the movie works perfectly. Some jokes fall flat, some dramatic moments don't grab you quite as much as they should. But most of it works, and works very well at that. Adam Sandler can make you laugh. Turns out he can tug on your heartstrings too. Who knew?",7,1,1,17 August 2011
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Sadness of the vampire
","Maybe the vampire life isn't all it's cracked up to be. The chance to live forever, that's a good deal right? But that deal comes, of course, with complications. Foremost among them being the need to kill. This is something Louis never really comes to grips with. Louis has been a vampire for 200 years. As we meet him, in modern-day San Francisco, he is about to tell his story to a reporter. And what a story it is. But it's a story tinged with melancholy and sadness. Some may embrace the vampire life. Louis though mourns the life he once had, the humanity he long ago lost.It all began in Louisiana in 1791. Mourning the loss of his wife and newborn child Louis just wants to be put out of his misery, to die. Instead, when he crosses paths with the vampire Lestat, he is born to a new eternal life. And immediately regrets it. Lestat more or less embraces his vampire existence. Louis never does. He soon finds himself feeding on the blood of rats. Better that Louis thinks than taking human life. But eventually Louis will have to accept what it is that he has become. He may accept it but he doesn't have to like it. This is one morose vampire. Perhaps what he needs is a companion to shake him from his doldrums. So Lestat gives him one. A child, Claudia. A young girl turned vampire. Louis loves Claudia and protects her. Not that she initially seems to need much in the way of protection. This girl's a killer, she loves the taste of blood. But what happens when she realizes she will never grow old? Will she accept her eternal childhood? No, she will not. And the ramifications for the happy little vampire family of Lestat, Louis and Claudia will be severe.This is a movie with a dark, gloomy feel to it. Necessarily the story unfolds entirely in the nighttime which only adds to the foreboding darkness. The vampire life we see here is anything but glamorous. As modern-day Louis tells his centuries-long story it is obvious he does not feel he really lives. He simply survives. When he had Claudia to love things were better but that story never seemed destined for a happy ending. Ultimately Louis is a lonely man, walking the Earth, feeding on those who cross his path and cursing the dark 'gift' he was given. Brad Pitt does an excellent job in the role of Louis, capturing all the melancholy, the weight of 200 dark years. As Lestat, Tom Cruise gets a much more flamboyant part to play and he does very well with it, taking the opportunity to chew some scenery but also doing some notably fine acting. Antonio Banderas, who pops up as a mysterious figure late in the proceedings, and Christian Slater, playing the reporter to whom Louis unburdens himself, both turn in good performances. With all the gloominess the film could use a lighter touch here and there and Stephen Rea plays a character who provides a few fleeting moments of levity. But there's a darkness in that character too. The vampire life is not one of fun and games. Perhaps the best performance in the film comes from young Kirsten Dunst playing Claudia. She's a real scene-stealer. Claudia's a woman, with decades of life experiences, trapped in a child's body. She has a maturity which belies her appearance and the actress playing that part had to show that same quality of maturity beyond her years. Dunst does so wonderfully. There's a lot of life that has been lived behind Claudia's young eyes and Dunst captures the essence of the eternal child perfectly. But as good as Dunst and Cruise and all the rest may be it's really Pitt's movie to carry. This is Louis's story. And it will prove to be a rather fascinating story indeed. Louis may not embrace his vampire life but you can definitely embrace this very entertaining movie.",8,0,0,7 July 2011
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Sublime silliness
","Silly boys. Those Monty Python chaps send up the King Arthur legend as only they could. Silliness from beginning to end. But silliness can be brilliant you know. And there is some truly inspired stuff in this movie. It's a farcical parody in which the laughs come fast and furious. You've got a three-headed knight. You've got a knight who just won't quit, no matter how many 'flesh wounds' you inflict upon him. You have knights who sing about that silly place known as Camelot. And of course you have knights who say 'Ni!' You have snooty, condescending French persons and their flying livestock. You have rabbits, both Trojan and killer. You have a unique use for coconuts and the question of whether coconuts can migrate. All of this surrounding the main plot, the quest for the Holy Grail. Oh who are we kidding, there really is no plot. The movie just careens from one gag to the next.The movie is brilliantly performed by the Pythons, each of whom takes on multiple roles. Graham Chapman, playing King Arthur, is the glue that holds everything together. All the nonsense revolves around him. Chapman is the straight man, if this movie could be said to have such a thing. Everyone else gets to be gleefully silly while Chapman's Arthur is a little more restrained as he focuses on his noble quest. But Chapman is as funny as any of the others. Arthur's Knights of the Round Table meanwhile are a quirky, eclectic bunch and each provides plenty of laughs as they go off in their own directions seeking the Grail. And for as good as they are portraying their respective Knights it is in the other characters they also play that the Pythons perhaps shine brightest. How can you not love John Cleese's Taunting French Guard? Michael Palin is great as the peasant Dennis who bemoans the class system and questions Arthur's legitimacy. Palin also plays the King of Swamp Castle and Terry Jones does great as heir to the swamp Prince Herbert. Among other things Eric Idle is a great dead collector, shrubber and monk. Terry Gilliam has comparatively little screen time but makes his own contributions with his great animation as well as co-directing the whole thing with Jones. No small task pulling all this film's wonderful nonsense together so Gilliam and Jones have to be given a great deal of credit for their directing work. The movie is really let down only by its ending. It's jarring and abrupt, the Pythons pulling the rug out from beneath their audience. It's typical Python though. But this last bit of silliness doesn't really work. For all the great stuff that came before the movie deserved a better conclusion than this. But a misstep right at the end isn't going to detract too much from the overall experience. This movie is funny, brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable from the opening credits all the way to the end. Well near the end anyway. Easy to see why this is one of the most beloved comedies ever. This movie which sends up the great Arthurian legend has become legendary itself.",7,1,2,9 June 2011
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The darkest and best of the original trilogy
","One of the rare sequels which manages to surpass the original, The Empire Strikes Back is an all-time classic. A much more personal tale, this film is really all about the journey of young Luke Skywalker. A New Hope followed Skywalker as he became involved in the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Here the rebellion is put on the back burner. This is less the story of a grand rebellion and more the story of one young man's growth as he continues to fulfill his destiny.We pick up with the rebels in hiding on a secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. All the familiar figures from last time around are here, including Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. And Luke Skywalker is here as well and it is Skywalker whom Darth Vader seems most interested in finding. Last time out Vader and the Empire were simply interested in wiping out the mostly anonymous rebels. Now, Vader has taken a personal interest in young Skywalker. The movie kicks into high gear as the Empire locates the rebel base and a great battle ensues. The rebels are forced to flee their base and here our heroes go off in different directions.Guided by the spirit of former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness in what is basically a cameo role) Luke Skywalker heads for the distant swampy planet of Dagobah where he is to be trained by the old Jedi master Yoda. Soon to be one of the most beloved characters in the series, Yoda is a 900-year old, two feet tall, green alien creature. The performances of puppeteer Frank Oz as Yoda and Mark Hamill as Skywalker are crucial here. Were the performances lacking audiences might have found it hard to believe these scenes where the young Jedi trainee converses and interacts with the rather odd little creature. But Hamill and Oz pull it off well. On Dagobah Luke (and the audience) learn much about the Force and the ways of the Jedi. In the original film the only Jedi we saw, Obi-Wan Kenobi was a rather mysterious figure. Now some light is shed on exactly who the Jedi are and what is required to become one.While Luke trains on Dagobah, Han Solo and Princess Leia are sidetracked on their journey to meet up with the rest of the rebels. Harrison Ford is terrific again playing Solo as he has the ultra-confident wiseguy role down pat. Carrie Fisher is again strong in the role of Leia, who drops some of the pretense of the last film and begins to give in to her rather obvious feelings for the swashbuckling Solo. Eventually Han and Leia make their way to Cloud City where we are introduced to another new character in the saga, Han's old friend Lando Calrissian. Han and Leia don't quite trust Lando and it soon becomes apparent that things in Cloud City are not quite what they seem. Sensing his friends are in danger Luke Skywalker leaves Dagobah to attempt to rescue them.Skywalker arrives in Cloud City to meet his destiny. Han, Leia and the rest of the characters fade into the background as the climax, much as the entire film, will be all about Luke Skywalker. Where the original Star Wars ended with an epic space battle, here everything leads up to a thrilling one-on-one showdown capped by one of the most jaw-dropping revelations ever seen in film.Some will say the ending of The Empire Strikes Back leaves the audience hanging. It is true there is not a clearly defined traditional ending as in the original film. But the ending here is powerful in its own way. It leaves you in great suspense, eagerly awaiting the inevitable conclusion to the saga. The film is not truly self-contained, it requires the knowledge of what has come before and the expectation of what will come after. It is by not going for the easy Hollywood ending that The Empire Strikes Back truly triumphs.Taken on its own merits The Empire Strikes Back can be said to even surpass the original Star Wars. The acting performances are again first-rate. Yoda is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable new character. In playing Lando Calrissian, Billy Dee Williams gives us someone well worth rooting for. Or against, we're not quite sure. The John Williams score, including the famed spine-chilling Imperial March, is magnificent. The visuals are dazzling, as would be expected. And most importantly we have a truly great story. The Empire Strikes Back, much more so than A New Hope, is Luke Skywalker's movie. It is fascinating to watch his journey as he moves towards fulfilling his ultimate destiny.",10,4,7,27 May 2005
Sin City," Style isn't enough
","Few movies are as stylish or as visually striking as Sin City. The movie looks spectacular, featuring beautiful black-and-white cinematography with little splashes of color which are used to very good effect. The visual effects are very well done which is rather important since the entire movie is basically one visual effect after another. So, in adapting Frank Miller's famous graphic novels, Robert Rodriguez unquestionably got the look right. But while the look of a film is important ultimately success or failure is determined by the story. The story is always the most important thing. And in Sin City the story, or in the case of this particular movie multiple stories, disappoints. Miller's tales may have worked very well in graphic novel form. But something has been lost in translation.The movie tells three stories which are only very loosely connected. Unfolding in a very strange, ultra-violent, rather corrupt metropolis each story centers on a good guy taking down a bad guy or two. And these good guys have a lot to say which brings us to the movie's first problem, an unrelenting voice-over narration which wears thin very quickly. Each hero narrates his own story and they narrate pretty much every single second of them. These guys just will not shut up. Never is there a peaceful, quiet moment to let the movie breathe. And this movie could sure use a little peace and quiet mixed in with all the bloody violence. By the time one of our heroes carries on a running conversation with a dead man you're quite ready to put your fingers in your ears. But the movie still has a long way to go from that point. And at times it's quite a painful slog. Even with all the action and mayhem the movie manages to, quite remarkably, be rather boring.All that style but so little humanity, that pretty much sums up Sin City. Very rarely does the movie make you actually feel anything. Of the three heroes it's the old cop Hartigan, played by Bruce Willis, who comes across the best. You really do root for him in his noble quest. Nobility is in short supply in Sin City. Mickey Rourke plays hero number two, Marv, who wakes up next to a murdered woman and vows to avenge her death. A solid performance from Rourke but Marv is a tough guy to root for. As heroes go he's a rather brutal one. The lines between good and bad, hero and villain, are often blurred in Sin City. At times those lines are wiped away completely as is the case with Dwight. Clive Owen plays this guy, a man with a sketchy past, who in the course of trying to protect the city's prostitutes (bad-ass girls who really don't need his protection) eventually finds himself in the aforementioned conversation with a corpse. It's this segment which really grinds the movie's momentum to a halt. And the movie never really recovers. There are some big moments, some cathartic triumphs. But there's also so much stuff which is entirely mundane. And will those narrators please shut up? The star-studded ensemble cast does the best they can with the material. Willis is very good, Rourke does well with a challenging role. With the possible exception of Jessica Alba who's a little flat (a problem since her character is the heart of the film's most emotional story) all involved do fine work. But the stories, at least as they're presented here, just don't work well enough. Sin City is a spectacular-looking movie. But movies can't get by on their looks.",5,1,3,3 November 2014
Gangs of New York," Born in the streets
","Gangs of New York takes a fascinating look at a largely forgotten slice of American history. As the film's tagline states, America was born in the streets. This is the tale of the 19th century Irish immigrants who came to New York City to build a new life for themselves and of the 'Natives' who tormented them. Put 'Natives' in quotation marks because they are not natives at all, their ancestors came over from Europe just as the Irish were doing now. But, led by the villainous Bill the Butcher, the Natives make life miserable for the poor Irish who are just trying to survive in New York's notorious Five Points slum. Bill the Butcher rules the Five Points with an iron fist, the Irish rally behind their own leader, Priest Vallon, to oppose him. The film opens with a battle in the streets, the Butcher's gang of Natives squaring off with the Priest's Dead Rabbits, his gang of Irishmen (and an Irish lady, the fearsome Hell-Cat Maggie). Carnage ensues, this is one of the most violent, blood-soaked scenes ever seen in any film. Brutal, raw violence, hand-to-hand combat which ends with Priest Vallon falling under the Butcher's knife. Young Amsterdam Vallon witnesses his father's death. He is sent off to the orphanage. He'll be back.16 years pass before Amsterdam returns to the Five Points. It is now 1862, the Civil War now rages and that war will come to touch the city. But the story the film follows is not of the grand scope of the great war but a smaller, more personal tale of Amsterdam's quest for vengeance. But it is not as easy as just turning up in the Five Points and stabbing Bill the Butcher while he sleeps. Bill is the king of the Five Points and you kill a king where everyone can watch him die. Amsterdam makes plans to kill the Butcher at the annual commemoration of the victory of the Natives over the Dead Rabbits. But that is months away. In the meantime Amsterdam falls under Bill's sway, rising to become the right-hand man of the unwitting Butcher who does not know the young man's true identity. Eventually the time will come when Amsterdam must make his move. And then things will explode.While the tale that Martin Scorsese tells here is a highly fictionalized account of what went on in the Five Points it is still a very worthy look at that unique time and place. The main storyline here may seem to be just a simple revenge story but there is so much else swirling around. Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher are not the only characters who have their own stories to tell. But it is the confrontation between those two characters which is at the heart of the film. That confrontation is made all the more fascinating by the fact they spend so much of the film as allies, Bill treating Amsterdam quite ironically almost as a son. Knowing Amsterdam's ultimate intentions you almost feel sorry for the Butcher. Almost. Because it is hard to generate true sympathy for this villainous, murderous man. An amazing character brought to life in a tour de force performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Day-Lewis plays the part with white-hot burning intensity. It would be a challenge for any actor to match him but Leonardo DiCaprio proves up to the task in the role of Amsterdam.The brilliant performance of Day-Lewis is the best thing the film has to offer but there is much more here to catch the eye. DiCaprio is excellent as well and a fine cast of supporting players chip in splendidly. Most notable are Brendan Gleeson as another Irishman who will cross the Butcher and Jim Broadbent as the gleefully corrupt Boss Tweed. John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, Liam Neeson and a host of lesser-known performers help to bring the Five Points to life. Perhaps the only misstep is Cameron Diaz who never entirely convinces in her role of a woman caught between Amsterdam and the Butcher. Diaz is not awful by any means but her performance just seems off a bit, she never quite seems to fit the role. Another issue comes with the film's ending, the sense that the climax doesn't quite match the epic opening. But these are only minor quibbles with a generally excellent film. Scorsese tells his fascinating story well, eventually weaving the larger war story into the mix. We see not just a personal battle between two men but ultimately a nation indeed being born in the streets. Visually the film is a masterpiece, Scorsese filling the frame beautifully. The bloody opening battle sets the tone for both the film's story and its look. The story holds your interest throughout and the look of the piece is just remarkable, the Five Points brought to brilliant life. This is a story which demanded to be told and that story could not have been placed in any better hands than those of Scorsese. This film does justice to those history has largely forgotten, those who through their working, living and dying built America.",9,1,1,25 August 2013
Moon," The lonely man on the moon
","Sam Bell works on the far side of the moon. He is near the end of a three-year stint manning a mining outpost from which helium-3, a source of clean energy, is sent down to Earth. Sam is all alone. His only companion of sorts is his robot assistant GERTY. Communications problems make live contact with Earth impossible, meaning he and his wife can only send recorded messages back and forth to each other. This is a man who can't wait to get home. It's been three long, lonely years. But just when the finish line is in sight there's an accident. And here things take a very strange turn. Sam is going to have to ask himself some very serious questions as he tries to come to grips with the shocking truth with which he is confronted. What exactly is going on here on the far side of the moon?This is a movie which requires you to tiptoe around the plot as you attempt to review it. Best to let viewers discover the movie's secrets themselves. What can be said is that Sam Rockwell turns in a rather astounding performance in the role of Sam Bell. It's somewhat clichéd to say an actor has to carry a movie himself but in this case it's absolutely true. When we meet him Sam Bell is all alone, giving Rockwell nobody to play off of other than the computerized voice of Kevin Spacey as GERTY. It's a great challenge for Rockwell. And then comes the movie's big twist and all of a sudden Rockwell's challenge grows much, much greater. It's a performance which you probably can't fully appreciate until you've seen the whole film. Only then can you stop, look back, and understand how difficult this must have been for Rockwell. You'll also have an appreciation for director Duncan Jones who, with a rather meager budget, produced some rather astounding visuals. The effects in this film are very subtle, you don't even really think about or notice them when the movie is playing itself out. Then afterwards you think about it and realize that in this movie filming something as simple as a game of ping-pong is a masterful technical achievement.If there can be any complaint at all it would be that the story of the lonely man does make for somewhat of a lonely movie. It's a one-man show and as that one man Rockwell is terrific. But with nobody else around there are times where there is really nothing for Sam Bell to do. The film struggles for momentum at times, especially in the beginning. But the story is compelling and very well thought-out. Once it really gets going it will definitely hold your attention. It's not a big, flashy sci-fi movie. It's a personal story, Sam Bell's story. And that's a story you'll find yourself emotionally invested in. This story definitely has a lot of heart to it. It's compelling and more than a little surprising. The direction this movie goes in is certainly not what anyone would have been expecting when we first meet Sam Bell. It's a very unique tale, one performed wonderfully by Rockwell. Give director Jones credit for the very interesting story. And for the impressive visuals. The effects, the moon base set, everything in the movie looks wonderful. Jones created a great little world for Sam Bell but it was going to take a great actor to pull off what the movie required of him. And Sam Rockwell was up to the task. It's Rockwell's movie all the way through and it his brilliance which makes the movie work.",7,1,6,13 January 2011
Slumdog Millionaire," Rather dire and very contrived
","In all the various international versions of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? a few things remain constant. One of those things is that the show is not broadcast live. Except in this movie. That's just the first of many contrivances you have to be willing to accept if you're going to watch Slumdog Millionaire. This movie asks you to believe so many unbelievable things. The fact that the game show upon which the whole plot is centered plays out in a way that is quite frankly impossible is a problem. The game show being broadcast live isn't the only issue. Other key moments of the game within the movie play out in a way which, back in the real world, simply could not and would not happen. So the very heart of the movie brings with it incredible flaws. Some may say let it go, it's just a movie, you're thinking too much. That would probably be easier if the setup of the game show itself was the only major contrivance. It's not. This movie piles contrivance upon contrivance to the point the whole thing strains credulity.The movie tells the story of Jamal Malik, a young man from the Mumbai slums who rather unbelievably is on the verge of winning Millionaire's grand prize. The show's host certainly doesn't believe it. He's convinced Jamal is cheating and hands him over to the police who are to beat the truth out of him. Doctors, lawyers, the best and brightest of India's society have gone on the show and been stumped. But Jamal, the simple slumdog, somehow has all the answers. And we, and his interrogators, are about to find out how exactly that came to be. We flashback to Jamal's childhood and then, as we watch him grow into a man, see the incidents in his life which enabled him to know the answers to every question he was asked. It's an interesting story to be sure but so contrived in so many ways. It's just too perfect that every question has a corresponding event in Jamal's life. And the fact that the key incidents in Jamal's life proceed chronologically in the same order in which the corresponding questions are asked on the show? Very convenient that. This whole movie has more than a hint of impossibility to it.So it's contrived but maybe that's OK because Slumdog Millionaire is, as the film's marketing breathlessly tells you, the feel-good film of the decade. Really? This is the most bleak, dire feel-good movie I've ever seen. Jamal has led a life filled with unimaginable hardship. Hardship which is portrayed in unsparing, brutal fashion. People love a rags-to-riches underdog story and that's what we have here. But if the film is destined to be ultimately inspiring, and that's clearly what the filmmakers are going for, it sure is rather depressing along the way. Depressing and all too often not particularly entertaining. The flashback structure comes off as somewhat gimmicky and robs the film of much of its momentum. You're interested in Jamal's story but never completely captivated. There's not enough energy in the movie for it to really grab you. The key romantic storyline falls a little flat as the girl over whom Jamal obsesses is someone who in actuality he hardly knows at all. For most of his life he has had no relationship whatsoever with this girl. That makes it hard to sell this as some kind of great romance. Eventually the flashbacks catch up to Jamal's present-day life which sets up the big conclusion. But by that point the movie has kind of fizzled out. It's already been robbed of any joy that it might have had. Honestly the only time this movie enjoys itself at all is during the closing credits. And by then it's much too late. It's not as much of a feel-good movie as it's purported to be. It's certainly not as entertaining or enjoyable as it could have been. And the story is so contrived. Honestly if you think about it the whole thing doesn't make much sense at all. Somehow despite all of that the movie doesn't fail completely. There's enough good stuff here to make the movie passable but that's about it.",6,2,2,18 August 2010
Donnie Darko," Captivating but ultimately frustrating
","Putting together a jigsaw puzzle can be fun. And make no mistake, Donnie Darko is a puzzle of a film which asks the viewer to put the pieces together. But in the end there is frustration as you realize you were never going to be able to put it all together. There are pieces missing. So while the film, which is certainly captivating and thought-provoking, is often fascinating it ultimately is setting you up for a bit of disappointment. It's nice to have a film which makes you think, which makes you work to understand it. It's also fine to have a film which is open to interpretation. But if in the end you don't have all the information necessary to make a reasonable interpretation that is a problem. And that is the case here. What just happened here? Hard to say. The untidy ending doesn't completely ruin the film, this is still a film well worth seeing. But there's no denying that the ending is a bit of a letdown.So who is Donnie Darko? He's a high school kid, a really smart guy. But he's got issues. Paranoid schizophrenia maybe, at least that's what his therapist thinks. He suffers from hallucinations, he sees things. And right now he's seeing a giant bunny rabbit named Frank. One night a jet engine crashes into Donnie's bedroom. But Donnie's not there because Frank has summoned him to a golf course where he tells Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days. What is Donnie meant to do with this information? Is this schizophrenic teen supposed to somehow save the world? Oh by the way, that jet engine? The one that would have killed Donnie had a giant bunny rabbit not summoned him to a golf course in the middle of the night? Nobody knows where that engine came from. No airplane lost an engine. Well that's weird. Things are only going to get weirder but then again you probably already guessed that since the plot revolves around a giant bunny rabbit.So the clock ticks down toward the bunny-prophesied doomsday. Among other events Donnie gets himself a girlfriend, rebels against life lessons taught by a ludicrous self-help guru and discusses time travel with one of his teachers. Time travel? Is that what this film is actually about? Who knows. The film never comes close to fully explaining itself. But the film certainly holds your attention. You can't help but be intrigued. You expect that all the weirdness will ultimately pay itself off with some sort of brilliant finish. Sadly that is not the case. The ending, while admittedly powerful, only adds to the confusion. There is a director's cut which makes things a little clearer but in the original version you're left to figure everything out for yourself. And you don't have near enough information to be able to do that. Donnie Darko is a very compelling film. And it is performed wonderfully. Jake Gyllenhaal hits all the right notes in his portrayal of Donnie, a character who is just as confused as we are. And the supporting cast is by and large excellent as well. Whether it be big stars like Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze, or lesser-known performers who you've never heard of, everyone fits their role very well, contributing their solid piece to the puzzle. But that puzzle never does fully come together. And that ultimately makes Donnie Darko a somewhat frustrating film. There's so much good stuff here to recommend it. But there's also that little tinge of regret, a wish that perhaps the giant bunny rabbit could have told Donnie, and us, what the heck was going on.",6,14,23,22 December 2014
Back to the Future," Going back again and again
","How many movies can you honestly say you would never get tired of seeing? Most movies, no matter how notably excellent they may be, lose at least a little bit of their charm, their ability to thrill, when you've seen them a number of times. Back to the Future is one of those precious few movies for which the thrill is never gone. There's so much here. Action, adventure, humor, drama, romance. The story is fabulous. The performances are fabulous. The music is fabulous. Great characters, great dialogue, great effects. Pretty much great everything. And even if you know the movie by heart, and at this point I pretty much do, it doesn't get old. Not a bit. I'll go back in time with Marty McFly over and over again. What a fabulous journey Marty goes on. Lucky are we who are along for the ride.The story is wonderfully simple and yet incredibly intricate. Teenager Marty McFly is sent back in time, from 1985 to 1955. In 1955 the most beautiful girl you'll ever see falls for Marty. Lorraine Baines is the dream girl any guy would fall in love with...if she weren't his mother. Yes, Marty's mom now has the hots for him instead of his father. Marty has prevented his parents from falling in love. If he doesn't fix that he will be erased from existence. Of course there is also the small matter of getting back to 1985. Thankfully Marty has a friend in 1955 who can help, Doc Brown. Marty and Doc, one of the great pairings in movie history.The movie starts a little slowly as it sets itself up. But then Marty and Doc come together in that shopping mall parking lot and the magic begins. From the moment Marty hops into that DeLorean and revs it up to 88 this movie is sheer perfection. Michael J. Fox, playing Marty, is obviously the glue holding the whole thing together and he is magnificent. But Christopher Lloyd, playing Doc, may be most indispensable of all. Could there be any other Doc Brown? With gestures and reactions and facial expressions Lloyd brought this character to life in a way nobody else could. He can say it all without saying a word. Of course when he does say something that's memorable too. 1.21 gigawatts! If having the kooky Lloyd playing the exceedingly kooky Doc Brown weren't enough we also get Crispin Glover playing Marty's father George. Or would-be father once Marty screws things up. Glover is a performer quite unlike any other and he makes George his own. What a fabulous job he did. Thomas F. Wilson makes for a great villain with Biff, hated in two generations. And Lea Thompson as Lorraine? Now that's a girl worth getting run over by a car for. Thompson certainly looks the part of the dream girl but she proves to be much more than just a pretty face. Her performance is perfect. The sweet, innocent 1950s girl. Or is she really that innocent?This is a story which had to be worked out meticulously and it was. Any missteps unravel everything. But at heart it's still rather simple which makes the story, and the characters, so easy to embrace. Director Robert Zemeckis tied it all together brilliantly. The story, the characters, the actors...it was a perfect storm which came together to produce true movie magic. This is a movie which is not just enjoyed, it is beloved. And it should be. What's your favorite Back to the Future moment? Is it one that makes you laugh? One that makes you cheer? Or one that makes you want to get up and dance? Go, go! Go Johnny go! Yeah, even the music in this movie is perfect as Marty desperately tries to get back to 1985. Ah yes, 1985, that glorious moment in time where if you wanted to put a really cool rock star in your movie you went out and got Huey Lewis. Everybody, Huey included, plays their part in this glorious movie. By the time the end comes, with one of the greatest closing lines in movie history because this movie is perfect right to the end, you want to stand and cheer. No matter how many times you've seen it. No matter if you're all by yourself in your living room. Stand. Cheer. You know you want to. And this movie deserves it.",10,1,1,28 April 2012
Goodfellas," A gripping tale of a mafia life
","As far back as he could remember Henry Hill wanted to be a gangster. He got his wish and in GoodFellas we get to go along for the exciting ride. Before the opening titles have even concluded we get a clear sense of the very dangerous yet oddly thrilling lives Henry and his fellow gangsters lead. And the sense of excitement and wonder is maintained right up until the bitter end.Ray Liotta is the nominal lead in his role as Henry from whose point of view the story is told. While Liotta is fine in his role Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito and Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway are even better. The boundless energy and manic temper Pesci brings to Tommy are absolutely perfect. Pesci's performance in the now-famous 'I'm funny how?' scene is acting at its best. De Niro's performance is more subtle but also brilliant and his portrayal of Jimmy brings a sense of menace whenever he appears. Even though he is for the most part restrained, you know he is fully capable of exploding at any moment. Also giving fine performances are Lorraine Bracco as Henry's wife, Karen, and Paul Sorvino as the quiet, mysterious, yet undeniably powerful mob boss Paul Cicero.GoodFellas depicts the rise and fall of Henry Hill in his life in the mafia. We follow him from his beginnings as a simple Brooklyn youth through dizzying highs and maddening lows. Henry is in effect telling his own story here through Liotta's voice-over narration and this device works well, filling in some blanks, helping to move the story along and also giving some insight into the motivations which drive his actions. We also get some insight from Karen's point of view as sporadic Bracco narration sheds some light on how a simple, naive girl gets swept up in the mob life.The unique Martin Scorsese touch also adds a great deal to the experience. So many sequences are brilliantly conceived and perfectly executed. None is more memorable than the truly brilliant tracking shot where for over three unbroken minutes we follow Henry and Karen from the street outside the Copacabana nightclub down through the bowels of the club and right up to the front of the stage. Few directors would even imagine such a sequence much less be able to pull it off so wonderfully. Scorsese's use of music is also pitch-perfect as he seems to always be able to find just the right song to perfectly frame each moment. And as would be expected with Scorsese nothing is spared in terms of violence or language. Henry Hill and those around him led ruthless, violent, dangerous lives and Scorsese captures that wonderfully. Proceeding at its own pace, GoodFellas allows you to really get to know and appreciate these characters. Some might quibble and say things move along too slowly, that the pace could be picked up. But there is no denying that, overall, GoodFellas is absolutely terrific.",8,0,1,31 May 2005
The Birds," Not Hitchcock's finest hour
","With so many Alfred Hitchcock classics to choose from The Birds is one of the great master's films you can safely skip. There's nothing in this film to really grab you. There are some nice bits sprinkled throughout but it never really all adds up to much of anything. In the end, it's a frustrating and, almost unbelievably coming from Hitchcock, a downright dull film.The plot, such at it is, in this film centers on a series of unexplained bird attacks in a seemingly ordinary California town. There's a little romantic intrigue, or at least there's meant to be, but that angle doesn't add much to the proceedings. Basically the movie is a lot of talk, very little action. And when the 'action' arrives it ultimately disappoints. To the modern eye, the special effects used in The Birds appear outrageously amateurish. Many of the bird attack sequences, meant to be fearsomely frightening, instead come off as being rather silly, almost comical. Certainly not the effect Hitchcock was looking for. Meant to shock and terrorize, The Birds does no such thing. The whole enterprise falls flat.There are some decent moments here and there and the cast does the best they can with what little they have to work with. So much of the dialogue seems forced and unnatural. And boy is there ever a lot of dialogue as we sit around and wait for those infernal birds to show up. In the key role of young socialite Melanie Daniels, who sets what little plot there is in motion, Tippi Hedren gives a pretty good performance. Perhaps not up to the standards of some previous Hitchcock blondes (Grace Kelly anyone?) but OK. Playing off Hedren, Rod Taylor gives a somewhat wooden performance as the object of her desire but that probably has more to do with the failings of the script than his own abilities. The rest of the cast does the best they can trying to convince us we should be terrified but it just doesn't work. In the end, when it finally appears the film might be building towards something, there is only disappointment. The Birds is a film which ultimately is going nowhere. And it takes its sweet time getting there. Hitchcock certainly had his share of triumphs. This is not one of them.",4,10,20,12 December 2006
Cinderella Man," Uplifting and inspiring but could be more entertaining
","There is no denying that Cinderella Man is a feel-good movie. The true story of Depression-era boxer James Braddock is among the most uplifting that sport has to offer. The film does a great job of bringing that story to life. It draws you in in such a way that it is impossible not to be a huge James Braddock fan by the time the final scenes play out. You see what makes this amazing man tick, the love he has for his family, the willingness to do anything for those he loves. You see the courage and determination that was required just to get by in this poverty-stricken time. You see this seemingly broken, beaten-down fighter show the heart of a champion. You see all this and you can't help but be inspired as Braddock's amazing story plays out before you. But there's the sense that something's missing. For all that this film has going for it there is a certain energy missing. It takes a while to get going and while there are bursts of energy throughout that energy is never really sustained. The pacing, or rather the lack of pacing, keeps a very good movie from being something truly great.While the story may move a little slowly at times the fact does remain that it is a truly wonderful story. And the actors who bring this story to life all do a tremendous job. As Braddock, Russell Crowe gives another in a long line of remarkable performances. Balancing the heart of this amazing family man with the strength of this amazing champion is no small feat and Crowe is to be commended for pulling it off so brilliantly. Very few actors would have been up to the task. Also reliably terrific is Paul Giammati as Braddock's manager, Joe Gould. Giammati may seem a little over the top at times in his portrayal but it works. Much of the energy the film does have comes from him. Portraying Braddock's wife, Renee Zellweger is solid if not spectacular. This is clearly Crowe's film all the way and Zellweger is left to play off of him and she does so admirably. Other familiar faces including Bruce McGill, Paddy Considine and Craig Bierko have smaller, but still important, roles and each of these actors also turns in fine work.So what we have is a terrific story which is wonderfully performed. Should be an absolute knockout. But Cinderella Man never quite hits the heights one might hope. It's certainly a very good film, one worth seeing especially if you need a little pick-me-up. You can't help but be inspired. But you may wish you were a little more entertained.",7,1,1,24 March 2006
Jurassic Park," A blockbuster that delivers
","You go to see Jurassic Park for the dinosaurs. And you will not be disappointed. If you are looking for well-developed human characters, great dialogue or top-notch acting Jurassic Park is hit-or-miss. There are some interesting characters, some snappy, witty lines and a few notable acting performances. But there are also some one-note, rather dull characters, some truly inane conversation and some performances which leave something to be desired. But have I mentioned the dinosaurs? A remarkable technical achievement for its time Jurassic Park places fully realized, totally believable dinosaurs right smack-dab into this live-action movie. Watching the human characters interact with each other can at times be rather dull. Watching the human characters interact with these amazing dinosaurs, many of whom are bent on eating the humans for dinner, makes it all worthwhile.The plot, such as it is, is really rather simple and serves only as a way to get hungry dinosaurs chasing after terrified humans. Through a miracle of science wealthy John Hammond, played in one of the film's better performances by Richard Attenborough, is set to open a new theme park where real, living, breathing dinosaurs are the attraction. Before the park can open lawyers insist he gets the park approved and declared safe by a team of scientists. Enter dinosaur experts Alan Grant and Ellie Satler and chaos theory proponent Ian Malcolm. While Sam Neill shines in the role of Grant, really holding the whole film together, Laura Dern as Satler comes off as a bit of a cliché, the woman in peril trying to prove she's as tough as the guys. And Jeff Goldblum's portrayal of Malcolm, who thinks the park is a really, really bad idea, conjures up memories of the rather annoying guy you knew who always couldn't wait to tell you how much smarter he was than you.Anyhow, suffice to say that once our threesome of experts enter the park (with Hammond's grandchildren in tow because, well we need some kids in danger don't we?) things go terribly wrong. Dinosaurs break loose and these magnificent creatures are bent on destruction. So for the rest of the film, dinosaurs chase humans, humans try to avoid being eaten by said dinosaurs and Malcolm gets to say 'I told you so' a whole lot. You expect moments of great drama, sheer terror and somewhat unbearable suspense and Jurassic Park delivers. The movie promised a great dinosaur action-adventure and it delivered on that promise. Yes, you have to sit through some cheesy dialogue and some annoying performances. Dern is kind of dull, Goldblum somewhat too smart for his own good and the young actors playing the grandchildren quite obviously too inexperienced to handle much of what goes on around them. And the less said about Wayne Knight's cartoonish portrayal of blubbering idiot (yet supposedly brilliant computer technician) Dennis Nedry the better. So yes, Jurassic Park has its flaws. But once those dinosaurs are let loose the film is a rollicking good time and one can't ask for much more than that.",8,1,2,17 January 2006
Beetlejuice," The ghost with the most
","There are so many comedies of the 1980s which provided some laughs upon their release but which all these years later are not remembered all that fondly if they are remembered at all. Beetlejuice is an exception. It may not be an all-time comedy classic but it has stood the test of time. The film has so many moments which are, if not exactly classic, certainly memorable. The movie is certainly a bit out there but it is that quirkiness which provides so much of the movie's charm. You haven't seen many movies quite like this one.As our story begins we meet young New England couple Adam and Barbara Maitland, played charmingly by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis respectively. Yes, there once was a time when Alec Baldwin was capable of being charming. Anyhow our very charming couple are rather unfortunately about to find themselves quite dead. After a car accident they find themselves back in their home, rather unsure of how they got there. They will soon come to realize that they did not survive the accident. And thus begins their bizarre journey through the afterlife. Turns out they have to remain in their home for 125 years. Which wouldn't seem all that bad...until the Deetzes move in. The Maitlands find the Deetzes, with their big plans for remodeling the house, to be rather obnoxious and our ghosts are determined to scare them away. They will get sympathy from an unlikely source, the Deetzes' goth teen daughter Lydia, played beautifully by Winona Ryder, who can see the ghostly pair and relates to them a heck of a lot better than she does to her parents.Now am I forgetting anything? Oh yes, Beetlejuice himself, the 'bio-exorcist' as played so memorably by Michael Keaton. It's easy to go this far not having mentioned Beetlejuice because in the grand scheme of things the character really isn't on the screen all that much. But when he is he certainly makes an impression. The movie gets an unmistakable jolt of energy every time the 'ghost with the most' shows up. Keaton turns in a crude, bombastic, manic and often hilarious performance. And to be fair Beetlejuice, the movie, is often crying out for the energy Beetlejuice, the character, provides. The movie is a little flat at times but Keaton is there to prop it up when needed. Director Tim Burton created a fascinating world here and inhabited it with some great characters. Not everything in the movie works. Some of the effects look cheap (Burton will tell you intentionally so) and the story definitely has some lulls. But when the movie hits it hits big. There are some scenes here which will always be remembered very fondly. Most notably two scenes which make great use of the music of Harry Belafonte come to mind. All in all it's a movie which should leave you with a smile on your face and sometimes that's all you really need a movie to do.",7,1,3,16 October 2009
The Simpsons Movie," The Simpsons. Longer.
","Here we have an episode of The Simpsons. Only longer. And, if you happened to see it in the theater, bigger. Other than some slightly crisper animation at times there is really nothing to set the movie apart from the television show. You can pretty much just count this as another episode of the series. To be fair, as Simpsons episodes go, this is a better than average one. Then again, for all the time and money they spent it had better be. Basically, if you like the show you'll like the movie. If you don't, you won't. Rather simplistic but also rather true.The movie's plot starts in a rather familiar place...Homer does something incredibly stupid. In this case Homer's stupidity leads to the government quarantining the entire town of Springfield under a giant dome. The Simpsons escape and flee to Alaska and from there the story proceeds in familiar Simpsons fashion. There are some scenes which seem to be there only to boost the running time to feature film length. In truth there's really nothing about the story that couldn't have been shoehorned into a traditional 22-minute episode. But all in all, the movie works. There's enough here to remind you of why you loved The Simpsons in the first place. There is certainly some room to quibble with the movie. With so much of the focus on the Simpson family some of the most popular characters seem to get the short shrift. (More Mr. Burns please!) Some of the jokes and gags fall flat but more work than don't. The familiar cast does a fine job bringing their famous characters to life and there's room for a solid guest turn by Albert Brooks as the villain of the story. Could the world have survived without a Simpsons movie? Yeah. But if they were going to make one at least they made it a pretty good one.",8,1,3,28 February 2008
The Wizard of Oz," The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz
","'We're off to see the Wizard, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz...'It's impossible to simply read that line. One sees it and can't help but start humming that oh so familiar tune. Heck, forget humming, maybe you just want to burst out singing. And therein lies the magic of The Wizard of Oz, undoubtedly, and deservedly, one of the most beloved films of all time. Magical, and downright revolutionary in many ways, when it first premiered in 1939, The Wizard of Oz stands the test of time, forever a treat for all ages. What does this film have going for it? Start with a brilliantly conceived, and executed, story. Add in some of the most memorable acting performances of all time. Toss in what for the time was startlingly brilliant color and dazzling cinematography. Don't forget the wonderful special effects, which may seem mundane by modern standards, but which were simply amazing for their time. And oh, have I mentioned the songs? You'll be humming, or singing, for weeks after watching this one. 'We're Off To See The Wizard', 'Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead!', 'If I Only Had A Brain/Heart/Nerve', 'Merry Old Land Of Oz', 'It Really Was No Miracle'...each a toe-tapping, stick in your brain and refuse to leave treasure. And of course there is what would become Judy Garland's signature song, the incredibly poignant 'Over The Rainbow', perfect in every way for the character of farm girl Dorothy in this film and made all the more poignant knowing the troubles which lay ahead for Garland in the years following the making of The Wizard of Oz.Who doesn't know by now the story of The Wizard of Oz? The film takes a little while to get moving in sepia-toned Kansas but those opening scenes are critical in introducing us to some very important people we'll encounter again in different guises later on. Once a twister picks up Dorothy's house and transports her and her dog, Toto, to Oz the real fun begins. When Dorothy opens the sepia-toned door of her house all of a sudden the screen is bursting with the most brilliant color you will ever see. The transition from dreary Kansas to magical Oz is simply breathtaking. And now the real fun begins. After spending some time with the tiny inhabitants of Munchkinland, and encountering witches both good and wicked, Dorothy follows the yellow brick road to the Emerald City where she hopes to meet the Wizard of Oz who may be the only one who can help her return home to Kansas. That journey along the yellow brick road may well be the most magical in film history.While Judy Garland in the role of Dorothy is the unquestioned star of the film The Wizard of Oz is graced with universally brilliant performances from a wonderfully diverse and talented cast of characters. Most notable are Dorothy's companions along the yellow brick road, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Cowardly Lion, played by Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr respectively. Even hidden behind layers of makeup, these three actors still manage to give their characters tremendous personality, something so critical in allowing the audience to identify with the characters they portrayed. Garland is undeniably brilliant but The Wizard of Oz just would not be the same without the extraordinary, and often overshadowed, talents of Bolger, Haley and Lahr. Special recognition to Bolger, the perfect scarecrow, who twists and turns and contorts himself in such a manner it's hard to believe he has a bone in his body.Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch, Margaret Hamilton as Dorothy's adversary, The Wicked Witch, and Frank Morgan in a number of memorable roles also have key parts to play and they are each terrific as well. And of course there are the multitude of Munchkins who provide a truly surreal beginning to Dorothy's magical journey. There's really not much to quibble with here, everything is almost pitch-perfect. Perhaps the opening scenes in Kansas could move a little quicker and maybe the stay in Munchkinland could be a little briefer, as the tiny Munchkins' cute factor begins to wane just a touch. But once Dorothy sets off on that yellow brick road The Wizard of Oz is undeniably one of the most magical movie experiences ever seen. A classic in its time and a classic for all time.",9,3,4,11 April 2006
The Fighter," Micky Ward's toughest opponent...his family.
","The Fighter, the true-life story of boxer Micky Ward, suffers somewhat from the fact that Micky Ward is pretty much the least interesting person in the movie. Micky is just a normal guy, trying to make his way in the world, hoping for that title shot. Unfortunately his family is far from normal, they're a bunch of lunatics. It is Micky's family, and his feisty girlfriend, who provide all of the film's personality. Micky is a rather bland character, left to do little more than react to all the chaos swirling around him. It's supposed to be Micky's film but, probably mirroring reality, Micky was never destined to be the star of his own life story.Mark Wahlberg turns in a perfectly acceptable performance playing Micky but there's really nothing memorable about what Wahlberg does here. All the big showy moments go to other performers. Most notable is Christian Bale playing Micky's crackhead brother, and trainer, Dicky. An eccentric character to be sure and Bale holds nothing back in his portrayal. Bale might be a little too eccentric in his mimicry, so obviously performing that it becomes a little distracting. It's a performance which really calls attention to itself, maybe too much so. Look at me, I'm acting! Also wildly over-the-top is Melissa Leo playing Micky's chain-smoking, rather grating mother and manager. Amy Adams plays Micky's girlfriend Charlene, showing some great spunk as she stands up to Micky's looney tunes family in a way he never will. Micky also has a collection of seven sisters who are portrayed here in a way that seems to be meant to provide some comic relief. But they don't come across as funny, they are just pathetic.With all the nonsense around him Micky really does end up getting lost in his own movie. His is an interesting story but the way it's presented here it's not even really about him. His family overwhelms him and overwhelms the movie. But the movie does still manage to be compelling. It may never quite grab you like some other boxing movies we've seen. The boxing scenes themselves are not notably better or worse than those we saw in so many other movies. There is the frustration that there is so much time spent with Dicky, who is a total train wreck, and the mother who is about as unsympathetic a character as you could possibly have. But the movie still packs a decent punch. It's not a great triumph if for no other reason than it struggles to make us invest in the central character. The other characters steal the show. Those characters are interesting in their own ways. Still it probably would have been better if The Fighter were actually about the fighter.",7,1,1,9 May 2013
From Here to Eternity," Time is not always kind to classic films
","Some films are classics in their time, some films are classics for all time. From Here to Eternity is more the former than the latter. When you watch the film you can see why it may have been so highly acclaimed upon its release, why it was awarded a bushel of Oscars. But you can also see that it has clearly not aged as well as some other notable films of its era. To the modern eye it's more soap opera than classic film. And often a rather hokey soap opera at that. It's a film with a style which struggles to convince all these decades later.The plot unfolds in an Army barracks in Hawaii in 1941. Army. Hawaii. 1941. No prizes for guessing where this story is ultimately headed. But this is really not a war story, it is more than anything else the personal story of one soldier, Robert E. Lee Prewitt. Montgomery Clift plays Prewitt who has been newly transferred to the barracks. What drives Prewitt's story? He once was a talented boxer but he doesn't fight anymore. His commanding officer wants him to fight on the company boxing team and Prewitt refuses. The officer and members of the boxing team thus set out to make Prewitt's life as miserable and difficult as possible. And that is the story at the center of the film. If you think that sounds rather trivial you'd be correct. In the grand scheme of things, especially considering the time and place, are we really supposed to care all that much about some Army boxing team? The rest of the story deals mostly with some romantic entanglements and that is where the soap opera aspect comes into play. We have Deborah Kerr playing the commanding officer's wife and she's a woman who gets around if you get my meaning. Donna Reed of all people plays a prostitute but this is a film made in 1953 so we're not actually going to call her a prostitute. She's a 'hostess' in a club but what her hosting duties entail is quite clear. But she's one of those movie hookers with a heart of gold and she falls for Prewitt. Meanwhile Kerr's character's current affair sees her involved with Sergeant Milton Warden who happens to work directly under her husband. Actually it's Warden who really seems to be running things at the barracks as the commanding officer is much too busy carrying on his own affairs. It's quite the tangled web. Oh and there's Frank Sinatra too, hamming it up as Private Angelo Maggio, a rather entertaining drunk whose character seems to be there for comic relief until things take an abrupt turn and we all of a sudden are asked to take him seriously.All in all it's quite the soapy melodrama. Prewitt is at the heart of the picture and Clift does a fine job in portraying the put-upon soldier. Probably the best performance in the film comes from Burt Lancaster playing Sergeant Warden but even Lancaster is not immune from the moments of overacting which this film has all too many of. The women are mostly shunted to the side. Kerr doesn't have much to do. Reed makes a bit more of an impression but the story really belongs to the Army men all the way. And at times it is hard to really take that story all that seriously. The story certainly has its dramatic moments but at its heart it's all about a soldier being abused...because he won't join a boxing team? And there are the love affairs which seem better suited for modern daytime television. And Prewitt's story does not really pay itself off satisfactorily which is a problem since the film has spent its whole running time trying to get us to invest our emotions in Prewitt's fate. The end result is a bit of a letdown. This is not a bad film by any means but it certainly has its share of flaws. In its time it may have been a true classic. But some films do not age as well as others.",6,8,13,23 June 2009
V for Vendetta," Remember, remember...
","So who is this masked man who calls himself V? He is a freedom fighter. He is a terrorist. He is a hero. He is a villain. Depends on your point of view. The movie brings a young woman, Evey, into V's world. And it is Evey's point of view which will prove to be most vital. What will she make of this man who is her rescuer and then her captor? What will V inspire in Evey? What will she discover in herself? Does she have the strength to do what is right? And what is right anyway? It's a movie which asks a lot of questions, not the least of which is whether Parliament is going to get blown to bits.The story takes place in a near-future dystopian London. The world has gone to hell in a handbasket. The United States has collapsed, chaos and terror seem to be the order of the day worldwide. England is presented as the last bastion of modern civilization. But all is not wine and roses here. Control is maintained by a government which rules with an iron fist. The fascist totalitarian regime has stolen freedom from its people. And in some cases stolen away their very lives. Undesirables are shuttled off to camps. Dissidents, minorities, homosexuals, Muslims, anyone who does not fit the ruling party's standard of purity is taken away, presumably to die in the camps. Those who remain 'free' live in fear of the government. There really is no freedom at all. One man stands against this. V is determined to bring down the fascists, to give England back to its people. And to blow up some buildings along the way.The movie begins with V rescuing Evey from an attack by the corrupt, rather Neanderthal, secret police. V blows some stuff up and they go their separate ways but they are soon to meet again. V commandeers a TV station to invite the people of England to rise up and join him. Conveniently for the movie's plot Evey works at this station and she helps him escape although she gets herself knocked out cold in the process. V brings her back to his hideaway and tells her she must remain there with him for one year for her own safety and to protect his identity as he builds toward the big climactic moment of his revolution. Understandably not thrilled with this scenario Evey plots to escape. But while Evey and V are together what connections will form? What does she really think of the man behind the mask? Events transpire which will force Evey to evaluate not just V but herself. She must find an inner strength. She changes, grows, learns so much about herself and perhaps comes to understand V's point of view. He may be an anarchist or a terrorist and the High Chancellor surely wants his head on a plate. But maybe V has had it right all along. OK, his methods are admittedly unorthodox but where does the true evil in this story lie? On the surface this may seem to be V's story, V's movie. But the argument can be made that it's really Evey's story which is most important of all. It's her evolution which drives the movie forward. And Natalie Portman does a wonderful job portraying that evolution. As Evey finds a power she didn't know she had Portman grows right along with the character. Hugo Weaving, in playing V, had the challenging task of giving life to a man hidden away behind a mask. Weaving does this beautifully, giving personality to a man whose face we never even see. Supporting players Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry and John Hurt all turn in fine work in their respective roles of detective, talk show host and tyrant. It's a movie about two revolutions. There's V's grand plot to topple tyranny. And there's the revolution inside Evey as a passive young woman begins to strive for control of her own destiny. It's a very compelling story presented in rather stunning visual style by director James McTeigue. Remember, remember, the Fifth of November. This is a movie which most certainly should never be forgot.",8,1,3,22 October 2012
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The Odyssey with music and laughs
","The Coen brothers present a reasonably entertaining comedy very loosely based on Homer's Odyssey. The hero of this film's journey is Everett, whose first name is actually Ulysses, and whose story parallels that of Homer's hero. But Everett's story is very much unique, the Coens take a rough outline from Homer and then make the story all their own. The story unfolds in rural Mississippi in 1937, a unique and, as we will come to see, rather strange place. Everett is an escaped convict who has two companions on his journey. Pete and Delmar were chained to Everett at the time of his escape, he convinced them to go along with him by filling their heads with a story of buried treasure. They lose the chains, will they find the treasure? The first person they stumble upon after their escape tells them they will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. Interesting. What will fate have in store for our trio at the end of their arduous journey? This is a comedy film which has its funny moments but the film is rather uneven. The laughs don't come as consistently as you would like. It is music more than comedy which really sparks the film to life. Everett, Pete and Delmar end up unwitting radio stars, the Soggy Bottom Boys. Their hit song, Man of Constant Sorrow, is a treat. The film has a good, lively mix of folk and bluegrass music throughout. So, the music is fun. The story doesn't quite match the music though. There are times where things move a little too slowly, times where things get a little too weird. At one point Delmar is convinced Pete has been turned into a toad. Yes, weird indeed. Delmar is a bit of a dim bulb, Pete isn't much brighter. Everett is the brains of the operation but, while he's got a quick wit, he's surely no genius either. There are times when the dimness of the trio is endearing, but there are times where it wears thin too.Everett, Pete and Delmar are certainly the focus of the story but they meet plenty of interesting characters on their Homer-inspired journey. And, keeping with the offbeat theme of the entire film, many of these characters are exceedingly odd. This really is a strange film but the Coens pull it all together reasonably well. George Clooney, playing Everett, is a good star to build around. Clooney brings real personality to the role. John Turturro, as Pete, and Tim Blake Nelson, as Delmar, complement Clooney well. There may be times the story drags, times where the comedy misses the mark. But it is not the fault of the performers, everyone suits their role very well. John Goodman and Holly Hunter are among those who pop into the film, portraying characters who take the story in some surprising directions. It seems a simple story, that of Everett and friends on an ordinary journey. But there is nothing ordinary about the world of this film. The Coens have populated this world with some supremely strange people. And that makes for a decent bit of fun. Maybe the film doesn't always work as well as it should but it perks up enough here and there to keep you interested and entertained. Things get a little bizarre at times but there is some fun in that too. And the music keeps things lively, you'll be clamoring for more of the Soggy Bottom Boys. This is certainly not the greatest comedy the Coens ever produced. But it's good enough to satisfy.",6,0,0,1 August 2015
The Godfather," What is there to say?
","Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.",9,5,6,16 June 2010
