The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Home Run First Time for Stephen Chbosky
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the better teen flicks of recent times. While I wasn't familiar with male leads (Logan Lerman and Ezra Miller), they could match wits against the excellent Emma Watson in a movie about early '90s teenage angst. Set in the South Hills of Pittsburgh, novelist/screenwriter/director Stephen Chbosky did a fine job with his first book/script/movie.One highlight of the movie is that most of the characters are fairly well-developed. Even without knowing everything about him, Sam (Watson) and Patrick (Miller) can tell our hero Charlie (Lerman) is another 'misfit toy,' just as they are. All of the kids have had trouble in the past or in the present, and they're generally dealing with it. But Charlie, especially, has difficulties. Chbosky shows how Charlie's past problems can't always be hidden, and emerge in some unexpected ways.The movie makes good use of its Pittsburgh location, particularly with some memorable trips over the Fort Pitt bridge. Any movie that can both cast Tom Savini and give Eide's a plug is good in my book! This movie might be a movie like American Graffiti in the future - a movie with an awful lot of young talent in one place at one time.",9,2,4,2 October 2012
I'm Not There," Fascinating Art Film
","I'm Not There is basically a two-hour long experimental film with uniformly excellent acting and production values. Todd Haynes' deconstruction of the writings of Bob Dylan was always interesting.But the movie doesn't just deconstruct Dylan; it takes a pretty good whack at American and British culture from the late '50s through the mid '70s, particularly the mod scene in London in the mid-'60s.Cate Blanchett is the best Dylan of the bunch, as the icon who turns the singer electric and leads him into a drug-filled time in London. She looked and talked more like Dylan than anyone else. Michelle Williams did a great turn as an Edie Sedgewick-esquire model named Coco. It was a pleasure to see Richie Havens in a small role as a guitar player early in the movie.While this is not a literal biography of Dylan in any sense of the word, the movie uses his music and attitude very well. I'm not a huge Dylan fan, but I know his music and parts of his life well enough that I really enjoyed the movie.",9,1,6,2 December 2007
Ted," Rare Comedy That Doesn't Give It All Away in the Trailer.
","Liked much of the movie very much - not every plot point is revealed in the trailer, for one thing. For another, while it was raunchy and foul-mouthed, it wasn't disgusting (well, except in one part), so it didn't annoy me quite as much as Bridesmaids did last year. It makes many insightful comments on mid-'80s culture (or lack thereof) and on celebrities. It does fall apart a little about 2/3rds of the way through when it generally stopped being so funny and started taking itself a little too seriously. While I don't care for Seth McFarlane's TV work, I enjoyed most of Ted, and think he, like Ben Affleck, has a great ear for the South Boston style of speech and attitude.",7,2,5,8 July 2012
Spotlight," Spotlight - Spot on!
","I had a feeling when I first saw Spotlight that it would be my favorite movie of the year, and it is. Exceptionally intelligently written, one of the best ensemble casts ever, it brilliantly portrayed how difficult dealing with child abuse in general is and how very difficult it was to deal with it in Boston when the biggest perpetrators were employees of the Catholic Church. It's a powerful and painful movie that never lost track of the importance of the past in dealing with horrors of the present.I lived in Massachusetts in the '80s and '90s. I was horrified by the former Father James Porter case and utterly dismayed by how little things changed after that case became oh so public. Spotlight insightfully portrayed why things failed to change after former Father Porter went to jail.The writers, Tom McCarthy & Josh Singer deserve all best original screenplay awards for 2015 hands down. I didn't see another movie all last year that was as solid as this movie. McCarthy also previously wrote & directed The Station Agent (Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson & Bobby Carnivale) and The Visitor (Richard Jenkins) and wrote the story for one of the best animated features ever, Up. Almost everything he touches portrays real people like real people on camera and I love that (yes, even in Up).I'd long been a fan of Michael Keaton and I'm very pleased that he's been in each of my favorite movies of the last two years (Birdman and Spotlight). Mark Ruffalo gave both a passionate and compassionate performance. And the actors who played the abuse survivors, particularly Neal Huff (Phil Saviano), Michael Cyril Creighton (Joe Crowley), and Jimmy LeBlanc (Patrick McSorely) captured the difficulties of telling their stories.While much of this movie may come off as religion-bashing and a love letter to The Boston Globe, watch carefully because there were times when the Globe failed and other times when individuals in the Catholic Church tried to help and were rebuffed as no one (including the Globe) believed them.When I look back at so many movies this year, I've seen many with great performances (like The Danish Girl and Concussion) but they seem to be lacking something in the storytelling. Spotlight lacks for nothing.",9,1,2,9 January 2016
Milk," Milk: The Best Movie of 2008
","It's possible I might see a better movie in the next two weeks, but I doubt it.When history is known (like, say, with the upcoming WWII movie Valkyrie about a plot to assassinate Hitler), a movie can loose its dramatic tension since 'we know what happens.' A good director, screenwriter and cast can compensate by dynamic direction, an intelligent script and spot-on acting. Milk succeeds on all points. Director Gus Van Sant and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black have created a compelling movie. And Sean Penn gives the most joyful, winning performance I've ever seen from him.Milk is the story of an unlikely political activist. Harvey Milk was a closeted gay guy in New York City until his very late 30s. The early scenes of Milk remind you what a bad old time the '50s and '60s were for gay men, with old footage of police raids on gay bars.By the early '70s, Harvey had met Scott, a much younger man. They ran off to San Francisco together where they opened a camera store. They had a very affectionate relationship. If this movie had been about a heterosexual couple and not a homosexual couple, it would have been rated PG-13 instead of R. Still, I've heard reports of some audience members leaving during the early kissing scenes (there are some sex scenes, but they are extremely discreet). Why would you go to a movie about a gay man coming out of the closet if watching two men kissing was going to upset you? As a business owner, Harvey understood the importance of being out and being organized. He became a frequently unsuccessful candidate for local office, while becoming more politically able and building a network of young men to support neighborhood causes. In these scenes, some of the actors are actually old friends of Harvey's from the '70s. In at least five different scenes, you see the writer Frank Robinson, a man who was Harvey's contemporary. While I wish they'd mentioned who Frank was, it was nice to see he was involved in the movie.Harvey became an expert at working the crowd and working the press. While Scott had served as Harvey's campaign manager, he was disillusioned by politics and the pair split up. Harvey went on to win the 1977 election for city supervisor. Harvey became involved with a volatile Hispanic man named Jack, and became close friends with Cleve Jones.Even though Harvey had a local victory, he got very involved fighting California's Proposition 6, a measure to fire gay teachers and their supporters. It was promoted by Anita Bryant (who only appears in this movie in old clips - a nice touch to reinforce how passé she should be) and John Briggs, a California state senator. After months of pushing, Harvey got to debate John several times. In the run-up to the statewide vote on Prop 6, Jack committed suicide which left Harvey fairly depressed. However, after pollsters and early results made it look like Prop 6 would pass, it wound up failing by a large margin.While he was fighting against Prop 6, Harvey tried to cultivate positive relationships with the other city supervisors. The relationship between he and newly-elected conservative supervisor Dan White was fairly contentious. After months of not getting any legislation passed, Dan resigned from the city supervisors and tried to get his job back. When he didn't get it, he smuggled himself in the city office building, and assassinated both Mayor Moscone and Harvey Milk.The movie certainly captured the grief of San Francisco following these assassinations. But these impact of these murders went way beyond San Francisco. I was 21, married, and living in Pittsburgh when I heard about them. To this day, I can't watch that famous tape of Diane Feinstein informing the public of the murders without weeping. And I had the same reaction today, at the beginning and ending of Milk. But most of Milk is one of the most vivid recreations of the '70s I've ever seen, with a performance that should win Sean Penn his second Oscar (and, maybe an supporting actor Oscar nomination for James Franco's fine performance as Scott). Emile Hirsch was fine as Cleve Jones, who later went on to be an AIDS activist and create the Names Project (the AIDS Quilt).This movie should most be seen by the people least likely to see it - the people who think things like Proposition 8 are a good idea. Consenting adults deserve to live their lives as they choose, without fear of retribution.",9,4,9,20 December 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Spectacular Art Direction!
","This is a fine, ambitious movie in a year when movies have been mostly pedestrian. It blows the cute Harry Potter right out of the water in terms cinematic impact. LOTR also has about the best art direction I've ever seen in a movie. The worldbuilding of Middle Earth was just wonderful.The casting is also top-rate. Elijah Wood did not disappoint as the young Hobbit who takes a very unexpected adventure. And Ian McKellan is superb as Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen, an actor who'd never made an impression on me before, was particularly fine.As I'm not a Tolkein purist, I don't mind seeing Arwen's part beefed up a little, because the lack of women in the trilogy has always bothered me. The adaptation was just great. The first time I saw the movie, I did complain about the editing, but, now that I've seen the movie many times, I think I may have seen a somewhat flawed copy of the movie.So while I don't think this is the best movie I've ever seen, it is a very good one, definitely worth your time even if you haven't read Tolkein.",9,0,0,25 December 2001
Cold Mountain," Good but not Great Movie
","Jude Law and Rene Zewelleger both give great performances in Cold Mountain. They, along with the  gorgeous photography and art direction, make the movie worthwhile.  But the movie, while not quite as dense as the book, rarely drags the viewer into the movie (except during the battle scene early in the movie).",8,1,1,27 December 2003
Spirited Away," Disney Ought to Be Ashamed...
","Ya gotta wonder - Disney is the US distributor, Disney knows how to market animated features - why has this breathtaking animated feature not been promoted at all in this country?It's a great movie, but really not for small children and it really doesn't have the toy/gadget possibilities of Disney flicks as most of the characters are not at all cute (except for Chihiro, of course).  And, perhaps, since animated features are now eligible for an Oscar, perhaps Disney decided to dump this movie, keep it forgotten in America, so they can promote the amusing (but hardly great) Lilo and Stitch come Oscar time.This movie has some of the most breathtaking backgrounds and animation I've ever seen.  True, here and there it has the kind of stilted animation of '60s TV animation.  But once Chihiro starts her adventures in the bathhouse, the animation practically leaps off the screen.  The level of detail in the backgrounds, particularly in the 'witch's lair' is unlike anything I've ever seen (even better than Beauty and the Beast, which set the bar pretty high for outstanding detail).I don't know much about Japanese myth/legend, and I suspect that the Japanese moviegoers got much more out of this movie than I did.   Still, it was great fun to watch.  Chihiro is a genuinely annoying kid early in the film, and showed more character development during the course of the movie than some live actors I could mention.  Early in the movie, her parents are enchanted by a witch, and the rest of the movie is about little Chihiro almost going through hell to bring them back.This is probably not a good movie for sensitive children, but most kids much above six or seven should have a ball with it.",9,1,2,2 November 2002
Bridesmaids," Who Spoiled Bridesmaids?
","I've had very mixed feelings about this movie from the first time I saw a poster for it in my local theater. On the one hand, I love Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig and I like raunch (like the scenes with John Hamm). OTOH, I hate scenes like the food poisoning scene. So, I wasn't going to go, but one of my husband's cousins (female) said it wasn't that disgusting so my daughter and I went.We liked it, though the disgusting stuff was too much, there was enough funny stuff that the movie almost came together. My daughter tells me that Hangover 1 was less gross than Bridesmaids. I wish people would pay less attention to Judd Apatow.The interesting thing was that most of the audience when we went to see it was women between the ages of 40 and 60 and a few men of about the same age. I figured the audience would have skewed much younger.What made the movie work for me were the scenes like the brilliant staredown between Kristen Wiig and Rose Byrne, the generally sweet scenes between Kristen Wiig and Chris O'Dowd (what a cutie!), the scene where Wiig knows she must dump Hamm, and even the scene when she makes the incredible cupcake for herself, during a time when she's swearing to other people that she's no longer baking. And the scenes in the jewelry store - hysterical!I was also happy to see Jill Clayburgh, even if I didn't recognize her at first (she died not long after the film was done).Now, about Meghan - what bugged me about her was that she was written and performed like Rosie O'Donnell. Not all fat women, even not all Irish fat women, act like Rosie. But, I like that Meghan was quite successful and smart on her own, even if she was socially very awkward. I just wish every time someone decides it's OK to show fat people having sex, that food wasn't instantly involved.As a writer and an actress, Kristen Wiig has huge potential. I just hope some guy doesn't ruin her next script. Bridesmaids wasn't ruined, but it wasn't nearly as good as it could have been.",6,2,6,31 May 2011
The Pianist," Polanski's Best
","It was a fine movie that could have benefited from some tighter editing. Brody was brilliant in the lead role, and Polanski has easily made the most harrowing movie of his career.I haven't read the book, but one thing that fascinated me about the first 1/3rd or so of the movie was that life in the ghetto was almost being told from a child's perspective. Certain things had an emphasis that I wonder if they came from the book or from Polanski's memories of being a child in the middle of the Holocaust. For example:Szpilman keeps running into a somewhat deranged woman who wanders the ghetto in a fur coat, looking for her husband.There's an old man entertaining a group of children.The way the adults dove for food that hit the ground.Many shots of the ghetto seem to be taken from close to the ground looking up, not so much at Szpilman's eye level.There was also good use of sound throughout the movie, but I note that it was not nominated for a Best Sound Oscar.The movie is interesting in that, here and there, there's an attempt to humanize a Nazi, something pretty much unseen in Holocaust movies since the late '70s miniseries The Holocaust (the Michael Moriarty character, while he invents ways to more rapidly exterminate Jews, feels very guilty about it). The music-loving commander near the end of the movie, who sees the end and would rather not go out of his way to kill every Jew he stumbles over.The main flaws in the movie were a tendency to let scenes drag a little (particularly towards the middle) and not really indicating what a celebrity Szpilman was pre-war (if that was the case). According to the movie, he seemed to be the last person to perform on Polish radio before the Germans took over. For nearly half of the movie, he's no where near a piano (for obvious reasons), but, when he is, he seems like he's a talented but fairly pedestrian classical pianist. Is surviving the war what made him great?",8,1,3,30 March 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Wonderfully Sensual Movie
","This movie has a sense of beauty and grace completely absent from American movies.   Ironically, about the last American movie I can think of that even attempted it was last year's otherwise forgettable Anna and the King (also starring Chow Yun-Fat).  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is just such a feast for the senses that you can willingly suspend your disbelief and just enjoy it.  Even the fight scenes are fun to watch.",9,0,0,12 February 2001
Children of Men," Best Movie of 2006
","2006 was a pretty awful year for movies, but Children of Men is an astonishing exception. Well-acted, well-directed, mostly intelligently written, Children of Men is one of the best movies ever. The fact that it's a science fiction movie gauls some to the point where they will not call it science fiction. It's a dystopia set over 20 years in the future. It's a science fiction movie with great acting, which makes it a rare movie indeed.V for Vendetta, the other big British dystopia, got more attention earlier in the year as it was a very flashy, explosive movie. But what Children of Men lacked in explosions, it more than made up for in a stronger sense of reality.I'm sure you've heard the plot - it's about 20 years in the future, women stopped reproducing and a flu pandemic killed many children. There's no one left younger than 18, so the remaining countries are in complete despair. Clive Owen is the poster boy for despair. I've enjoyed performances by Clive Owen in the past, but he's emotionally naked in this movie and he's absolutely superb.There's an extraordinary scene late in the movie that may be one extremely long tracking shot (or, then again, maybe not). It follows Clive Owen into a street battle and into a ruined apartment building. It shows the harrowing nature of urban warfare better than almost any movie I've ever seen.While it was a very violent movie in places, it's not gratuitously violent. The R rating may be more for the language than for the violence (well, and one scene involving a naked woman, but the nudity is not gratuitous either).I highly recommend this movie.",9,3,7,13 January 2007
The Dark Knight," Aaron Eckhart Shines in a Good (but not Great) Flick
","This movie tries very hard and has brilliant casting, often brilliant special effects, and some genuinely frightening make-up effects. Heath Ledger is very good, but I was particularly impressed by Aaron Eckhart, who's gotten extremely little notice for a very tricky part. Eckhart starts off as an extremely sincere Harvey Dent, but if you know anything about the Batman story, you know Harvey Dent has...eventually...issues. You can also figure out how Harvey changes during the course of the movie, and the director and screenwriter handle this part of the movie very well. I'd also like to give some kudos to Maggie Gyllenhaal whose Rachel Dawes had a little more oomph than Katie Holmes' version did three years ago.Perhaps the basic problem problem with the Batman movie is that, in many ways, it's the most grown-up comic book movie ever. But, it's still a comic book movie, so it's violent in places and weighed down by chase scenes and wild hostage situations.I enjoyed Iron Man very much earlier this year, probably because it never took itself completely seriously. The Dark Knight takes itself quite seriously and mostly succeeds. But, a few less semi-tractor trailers flying through the air would have been very much appreciated.",7,4,7,19 July 2008
Mystic River," Frustrating Movie with a Great Sean Penn Performance
","I love slow movies that build, particularly if the writing and direction are sharp and the acting propelling the movie along.  Mystic River started off being that kind of movie.  There's a tragic flashback, and a leisurely look at a fairly typical Saturday in the present day in an urban area near Boston (unclear where - probably Charlestown based on its proximity to the city). Suddenly, Saturday becomes Sunday and the day is in no way typical.  Senn Penn does a great job at playing the grief-stricken father.However...Kevin Conway has a great (and uncredited!) bit part as Annabeth's father, appears briefly in one (or maybe two scenes) then disappears off the face of the earth.One character pretty much arranges to have another character killed.One character (a person without much money) has managed to anonymously pay someone $500 a month for about 12 years.  How does that work exactly?The dark lighting effects are sometimes handled brilliantly (when Dave is telling his son about the boy running away from the wolves) and sometimes render the actors invisible.Another character shows a steely spine after being something of a mess for most of the movie.The ending is just so scattered you wonder how it happened, after the movie starting off so promisingly.I don't hate this movie.  I'm glad I went.  I don't know if it's just very faithful to a muddled book or what.  But it's almost as if a different director and writer did the second half of the movie.",6,0,0,8 November 2003
Steve Jobs," Captured the Chaos Around Computer Launches Very Well
","Steve Jobs really isn't a biopic. It was a look at how Apple/NeXT computers were introduced to the public, how Steve Jobs made those launches happen, and his relationships with several pivotal people in his life (Joanna the marketing czar; Woz his early partner & hardware guru; John his mentor/Apple CEO; Andy, longtime Apple developer; Chris an old lover & mother of his eldest daughter; and Lisa, his daughter).The movie opens with the SF writer/futurist/inventor & 2001 author Arthur C. Clarke talking in the early '70s about how he envisioned the future of computers. Just about everything Clarke described happened in the computer industry by the late '90s. It was a great introduction to life pre- Internet/pre-personal computer - some people felt the technology would come (before flying cars even). And people like Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates and Paul Allen helped to turn futurists' dreams into realities that conflicted and competed for decades.The movie covers 3 different computer launches - Mac (1984), NeXT (1988) & iMac (1998), the chaos around them and how to make it look like the computer was working as expected even if it wasn't. Characters weave in and out of Steve's sphere as Joanna tries desperately to keep him focused on the task at hand. A few flashbacks back to the early development days in the garage show how far Jobs came. In many ways he was more of a marketer than his marketing department was.This movie is great for people interested in computers. It may not be all that revelatory about Jobs himself, though the scenes between Steve Jobs and John Sculley were particularly good. The scenes with his ex-lover and daughter were a little too soap-operish and seemed almost out-of-place even though they were important to the story. Michael Fassbinder as Jobs and Kate WInslet as Joanna were particularly good, but the entire cast was terrific.I expect to see the movie Steve Jobs adapted as a play any time now, the script is so strong.",8,0,3,23 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Very Good Looking, But Not Great
","The first half hour or so is one solid video game - all sound and fury, signifying very little. It gets a little more interesting in the quieter moments, until an awkward Lucas line hits, or Hayden Christiansen looks more uncomfortable than dangerous. The effects are great, but because there so many special effects it seems like overkill after a while.The final battle is pretty good, and there is a frighteningly ironic detail that shows you how Vader survives his encounter with hell.The acting is all over the place, but it's mostly pretty good, led by very strong performances by Ian McDarmind (Palpatine) and Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan). Christiansen is certainly stronger in this movie than in Attack of the Clones, but still doesn't quite pull it off. Natalie Portman is good as Padme but is given depressingly little to do. It would have been nice to see more of Jimmy Smits. Yoda has become the best CGI character since Gollum.***Comments on how it should have been*** **sorta spoilers**There is a wonderful scene in Return of the Jedi between Luke and Leia, where they talk about their parents. Leia has a line where she simply says 'I remember my mother. She was so beautiful...and so sad,' as if she'd known her biological mother, and her mother had died when Leia was a little girl (and not just when Alderan is blown up in Star Wars). I'd always hoped that Padme survived childbirth, perhaps being presented as a queen on Alderan, to raise Leia as her daughter. Since Leia is, also, raised by an adoptive mother, that line won't feel the same the next time I see Return of the Jedi.I thought it was a terrible cheat to not show Annikan slaughtering the Jedis-in-training. We saw him slaughter everyone else, and the movie was rated PG-13 for a reason! I'm not advocating blood and guts, just honest, on-camera proof of what a monster Vader had become.",7,0,1,19 May 2005
Wonder Woman," The Wonder of Wonder Woman
","Months ago, I had very mixed feelings about going to see the Wonder Woman movie. I was never a big Wonder Woman fan in the first place. I'd read the comics sometimes in the '60s, watched the amusing Lynda Carter show in the '70s but was never really into it. I was really sick to death of the current Marvel and DC comic movies - the Marvel movies were no longer very funny and the last good DC-related movie was probably Batman back in the late '80s. I figured I'd give WW a pass.And then I started seeing the trailer for the new Wonder Woman movie. It was an impressive two minutes. Interesting photography, athletic leaping about, some humor...maybe this would be good. I'd always hated the slow motion in movies like The Matrix but the use of slow-mo in the trailer made sense for Wonder Woman. So I went on the first day. I went on about one hour of sleep, so during the first hour of the movie, i dozed off periodically and missed a few points. The theater wasn't terribly full for a 12:30 show, but it had more than the 10-20 you often see during the first show on a Friday. I did manage to stay awake through most of the second half and really enjoyed most of it. The scene where Wonder Woman rose out of the trenches and ran across the battlefield was extremely moving on many levels.There were at least two backward-nods to 'Great Famous Feminist Moments in Movies and/or Books. The scene I mentioned featuring WW racing across 'No Man's Land' just screamed the famous moment from Return of the King where Eowyn rips off her helmet, screams 'I am no man!' and kills the Witch King (with help from another 'non-man,' Merry). The other moment was a little quieter and I missed it during it first time I saw the movie (I liked it so much I went again on Saturday with my family) as I was sleeping. There's that amusing scene when Diana and Steve talk on the boat, and she explains that she understands about pleasure seemed like a shout out to Teri Garr's famous comment in Tootsie 'I'm responsible for my own orgasm.'The action scenes were all well-shot, and there was always enough character development and dialog to keep the movie interesting. Strong photography, effects, costumes, production development, acting, script - this is probably the best action movie I've ever seen. I ranked it an 8 on IMDb. Congratulations to Patty Jenkins, Gal Gadot & the rest of the crew - you did a GREAT job!!MY ONE SPOILERY BIG QUIBBLE WITH THE MOVIEI had such hope that maybe, just maybe, the 20 minutes of bloated fighting at the end of every action movie would not happen in Wonder Woman. When Diana killed the German general, I nearly stood up and cheered. But then she realized that even though she thought she'd killed Ares, the war was going on...because the war-mongering general was not Ares, but someone more behind-the-scenes was...which, after a few minutes of interesting discussion about how Ares worked, launched into about a 15 minute-long boated fight scene. Oh well, at least it seemed a little shorter than usual.",8,6,14,5 June 2017
Vanilla Sky," An Interesting Effort
","This is not a great movie, but it held my attention for the most part.Cameron Crowe is generally very much an actor's director, but he went into the stratosphere with the script and it's hard to tell if he succeeded or not.  I suppose I'd like to see it again to make sure! In light of the views of reality in this movie, I'd be curious to see what he would do with Neil Gaiman's American Gods, should that novel ever be optioned for a film.  And I'd definitely like to rent the Spanish film that served as the film's inspiration and supplied the ever-evocative Penelope Cruz as the female lead, playing the same part she had in the original (is that the first time this has ever happened?).Tom Cruise really did not impress me in this movie, with the exception of one scene very near the end.  I'm not sure what it is about Cruise - he's given some incredible performances in a few movies, notably Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire.  He and Crowe work well together.  He was a convincing narcissist during the first third of the film, but he really had enormous trouble playing a man whose life was ruined.******SPOILERS/SPOILERS/SPOILERS**********The very first voice you hear in the movie is Penelope Cruz saying 'Open Your Eyes.'  But, 'in reality,' Tom Cruise is having a dream and hasn't met the character of Sofia 'yet.'The next voice you hear is Cameron Diaz saying the same thing, only this time it's 'reality.'That made me think that, perhaps, the whole movie was one long dream.Reality is a little skewed in any case.  In an early scene, Tom Cruise's car has an inspection sticker with a date of '2/30/01.' Late in the movie, what is 'reality' and what is 'the dream' are explained.  Various red herrings are revealed and discarded - or are they? The last thing you hear is yet another female actress saying 'Open your eyes' at the very end of the movie.  'In reality,' the Cruise character has been in cryonic suspension for 150 years...or has he?  Is he just still dreaming lucidly?",6,0,0,14 December 2001
Blade Runner," Director's Cut vs. Original Theatrical Release ((Spoilers - Don't Read if You Care About the Deckerd Controversy))
","I really admired the original theatrical release of Blade Runner. The reimagined Los Angeles was fascinating. The performances were all very interesting. The voice over didn't bother me all that much. But I've argued for years that Deckerd can't be a replicant, based almost purely on the voice-over.Now that I've finally seen the director's cut, it's clear that he is. There are only very tiny changes between the original release and the director's cut, but they are enough to change your mind about who is not a replicant and who is. The removal of the voice-over, and the occasional use of 'replicant eyes' reinforces that 'replicant status' of the various characters. And it was enough to make me up my rating of the film from an 8 to a 9.",9,1,2,2 March 2005
Signs," Excellent beginning & details, but poor script logic and horrible ending
","This movie is so promising.  A lovely cast, good dialogue, sharp directing early on.Oy.Sadly, the movie is kind of a mess, though Gibson and the kids give pretty good performances.Spoilers. * * *At one point, the Hesses are in a pizza parlour, talking about the paranoia gripping the small town after crop circles are discovered. Then, the director pans to a man walking to his van.  The man is, the director, an Indian man who is walking in small town American while the cast talks about fear of outsiders.What a great moment, I thought.Unfortunately, I missed a key piece of dialogue.  The Indian man, it turns out, was the town vet who'd fallen asleep at the wheel of his truck and killed Mrs. Hess several months before.  And that's why everyone was eyeing him so warily.That was the first of many disappointments in this movie.Actually, the logical gaffes start earlier.  We are supposed to believe that no airplanes or helicopters fly over Bucks County.  So that the Hess's massive crop circle is completely unknown by anyone outside of the family and a very tired sheriff.  How could it have remained unnoticed??We're supposed to have a sense of growing paranoia about the possible alien invasion.  (Our local movie critic, a man who typically writes intelligent reviews, completely lost it over this point - he felt that no one would be afraid of an alien invasion since everyone had seen ET.  But everyone's also seen Independence Day...)  That was generally pretty well-handled, except that Hesses completely loose it before it's clear that the aliens are probably malevolent.  The aliens pretty much stay up in their spaceships and send down periodic reconnaisance.  They don't level cities like in Independence Day.The Hesses nail themselves into their old farmhouse, then go into the basement (a great place for a boy with severe asthma to hang out). The aliens make a lot of noise (shades of Close Encounters without the backlighting!), but never actually invade the room.  When an alien finally meets up with the family, you can absolutely see the ending coming from about the middle of the movie.The last quarter or so of the movie, and the director way overusing himself in what should have been a walk-on, were very problematic. M. Night Shyamalan also has a bad habit of recapping his movie near the end.  While it was effective (and almost necessary) in The Sixth Sense, it was really ridiculous in this instance.  And using that moment to flashback to Mrs. Hess' death completely broke the tension in the 'now' of the movie.I liked The Sixth Sense quite a bit, and found Unbreakable flawed, but interesting.  However, Signs, particularly the last half hour, is just plain dumb.  And extremely disappointing.  I think Shyamalan, the director, needs to fire Shyamalan the writer before something worse happens.",6,0,1,3 August 2002
Amélie," Cute, well-photographed, but slight movie
","I enjoyed Amelie, with its charming cast and photography, but this is not a great movie.  It's a very European look at a withdrawn young woman who starts to break out of her shell due to complete happenstance.However, if you're looking for a diverting movie that isn't populated by violence, stupid teens, and the standard moronic American script, you can't do much worse than spend a few hours with Amelie. Heck, there's even a little quiet mayhem and not-quite-so-quiet sex in this flick. And the photography is quite interesting.",7,0,1,10 February 2002
Gladiator," Worst 'Best Picture Oscar' since 'The Last Emporer'
","This movie is just such a mess, that last year must have been a worse year for movies than I'd realized.  That said, Traffic is head and shoulders in quality beyond this silly toga movie.There are little scenes in this movie that do not relate to ANYTHING - most notably, the scene near the end where someone puts a poisonous snake in a bed.  The viewers are lead to believe that a certain traitor was being killed; the set-up about Cleopatra had been made in the previous scene.  But nothing happens - the character is clearly alive later.The scenes involving war crib from the best - Rashoman and Henry V, with music stolen from Holsts' The Planets.  The gladiator scenes steal from Spartacus (with more gore, of course; Spartacus, made over 40 years ago, is a vastly superior movie despite Tony Curtis' problems with acting).  The Collesium scenes use many shots from Ben Hur.The performances are all over the place.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed (whose ruminations on death in the movie are all the more eerie since he died during the filming) are terrific. Russell Crowe is pretty good, but not great.  His best scenes are during his general days early in the movie.  But Juanquin Phoenix and, to a degree, Connie Nielsen feel like they are in a completely different movie.Some of the photography and most of the CGI work (except when they attempted to animate a tiger) is quite good.  The animated tigers intercut with real tigers showed the CGI isn't perfect because the perspective is extremely flat when the animated tigers are used.This movie is an ambitious disappointment.  It is very much like Ben Hur in that it has flashes of brilliance but is undercut by a surprisingly awkward script.  On the whole, I'll take Ben Hur and Spartacus for great cinema about Rome.",6,0,1,8 April 2001
The Proposal," Lightweight Confection with Very Good Casting
","This was a fun flick, mostly filmed in Massachusetts, in a community on the north shore called Rockport. Even with some mountains CGI'ed in the background, Rockport didn't look that much like Sitka, Alaska. It looked...well, like Rockport with mountains inserted. Still, they tried. At least the second unit might have gotten up to coastal Alaska for a few shots of mountains and the midnight sun (or their special effects folks had some fun with that).Yes, Sandra Bullock's character behaved like a jerk for most of the movie, but Ryan Reynolds was getting something he really wanted - a massive promotion. So the script observes frequently that he's manipulating her as much as she's manipulating him. He's getting something he wants desperately.I loved Betty White - where's she been? She was great! While Mary Steenburgen was good, it was a little disconcerting that she looked so much like Bullock. It lent a little Oepipal tint to the proceedings.I'm not normally a fan of Ryan Reynolds, but he was pretty charming in this movie.So, I didn't think this was a waste of money. Of course, I only paid $6.50. I might have been more critical if I'd paid a little more...",6,0,3,20 June 2009
