First Man," One of the most boring movies I've ever seen
",I wanted to quit this about 40 minutes in but my wife wanted to finish it. I guess she likes Gosling. So unbelievably boring. I would expect them to make it exciting since it's the seven thousandth movie about the moon landing.,2,1,3,25 December 2018
Hereditary," Best horror flick since the Shining
",Amazing amazing movie. If the main chick in it doesn't win an Oscar then the Academy Awards are rigged.,10,2,6,4 December 2018
Creed II," So bad
","A total cash grab. I was supposed to care about the main character, I didn't. Mostly all drama and nonsense. To be honest, I couldn't even finish it so. It was just too awful.",2,17,31,14 February 2019
