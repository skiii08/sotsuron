United 93," A Film to Be Appreciated, not Entertained
","If you go to United 93 you will appreciate the intelligence and the art that went into making this move, however, it is far from entertaining and I don't sense that the producers meant it that way. If you don't feel sad I suspect you are not human.It is film making at a much higher level than we are used to getting. The passengers on the plane deserve at least this for what they did rises above what we are used to getting in the mundane trite formula movies of today. When I left the theater I felt that I had left a requiem that left me sad, and also a celebration of life for the people on the airplane.I predict that this movie will become a classic and much more appreciated after time has passed. Yet, I would not wait for time to pass to go see it, the people on the plane have earned that honor now.",10,3,7,30 April 2006
Gravity," You don't need IMAX or 3D or Aliens to make a great space movie
","I have macular degeneration, more pronounced in one eye than the other so I don't have much sense of depth. Therefore I didn't bother to see it in anything other than widescreen format. Even so, the film really fulfills my yearning to see at least one more great movie in the theater. This film was the perfect film to fulfill my yearning. It is terrific in widescreen format, the best of the best of fusion cgi and actual sets. Bullock does a great job, the best space movie I have ever seen. Clooney if likable but he could have mailed in his performance. And no cgi aliens were needed although I have been so used to that genre of horror movies I watched for an alien to jump out. None did if you don't count a subconscious dream that helped to solve a problem. If you see it, I would recommend do the 3D or IMAX experience if you can, I see from other reviews that it takes the photography to another dimension. I will go back and see it in 3D just to make sure I don't miss something. I suspect that those who can't get that this is a great movie were expecting a mundane film that they can play computer game with. This movie has content, unlike the one dimensional movies we have gotten so used to. Like if the movie goer is challenged to think,they don't have that cognitive ability developed yet therefore they pan that which they can't comprehend. Footnote: I went and saw the movie again in 3D and IMax. It was better than in 2D for sure.",10,3,6,9 October 2013
Once," Ironic But Hopefull
","It is the ironies that sets the movie apart from other movies of its time. Two people meet and fall in love. It is as if each completes the other, the irony is that neither has completed the semi past romantic relationships they are in with others, It will do no good to consummate their relationship until that work is finished.Whether conscious or with awareness, each commits to the other, and then go their separate ways. We are left not knowing how they will reunite, but with the feeling that they surely will when the time is right.I admire how this movie was made, the script although unpolished, is original. The acting is subtle and tells the story wonderfully. The director takes us on a journey that i think that we each wish we would take at least once in our life time. I find myself still remembering the music a week after seeing the movie. Well done.",9,3,4,3 August 2007
Knocked Up," Should be on 2007 list of worst movies
","With all the hype and great reviews by film insiders, I felt for sure that I would be seeing the comedy of the year. As it turned out about the only thing I can recommend this is for is to be put the list of the worst movies of the year. It didn't get close to delivering the laughs promised. It wasn't about the acting or production values that I say this, its because there just isn't any humor in the movie. Attempts at humor in the early part of the movie were pathetic, by the time they got to near the end, who cared. The script and direction left me wanting to throw my popcorn at the screen because they were so lame. I think that Katherine Heigl is drop dead gorgeous, and I hoped that this movie would turn out great so I could see more of her on the big screen. In the whole movie the very best part was when she folded the baby clothes using her huge tummy as a table. When you find this to be the funniest part you know it isn't funny.Don't take a date to this movie, you will both want to run out screaming.",5,9,22,1 June 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Ultimate Boring Movie
","If you are so easily entertained by mindless car chases, wrecks, fights, and gun shots that you would rate this movie higher than a 4 you are getting what you deserve. The plot is so thin in this that it could only have been written by a committee dedicated to screenwriters anorexia. Dialog is painfully dull and relationships between actors so scantily developed that I would be ashamed to have my name on this.The cutting of this film leaves you feeling like you have taken a ride inside a pinball machine. It seems to swat you around from one point to another in the script without regard for any development of its characters.If this isn't bad enough the decision to make it with hand-held cameras with all Steadicam turned off creates the feeling of being aboard a small boat in a bouncing ocean.It was just plain boring, not Bourne.",4,20,39,4 September 2007
Silver Linings Playbook," Good Entertainment but not at all realistic - see it anyways
","Although this movie is definitely entertaining and well made it does little to show the actual road to Bi-Polar Effective Disorder (BAD) recovery. In the movie the subject spends eight months in a mental institution after a major break with reality. He is then discharged without being grounded except with medication that he resists taking. He is easily seduced into a dance contest in order to be with a girl with whom he is attracted. She is just about ungrounded as he is. Then after doing well in the dance contest it looks like it is going to be all silver linings.If one knows anything about B.A.D. it is that the recovery takes a lot more than is shown in the movie.However, there can be recovery if a person works at it. The work they will have to do is to grieve many wounds and losses they incurred while growing up. It takes deep grieving and unless they are prepared to do the work they will most likely run from it. It is the hardest spiritual work they will ever be required to do. But, if you do it you will come out feeling whole and in charge of your life. You will feel okay with yourself. If you commit to do the work the things you will need to do will become apparent. Keep faith.You will have to let loose of some relationships that are in your life because they will not want you to change. This will hurt but it is necessary. Good luck",9,0,1,14 February 2013
Ratatouille," Delightful and Fun For All Ages
","This movie is an absolute delight. It has something to offer to all ages and I predict that it may become the movie that deservedly pulls in the most box office in 2007.The cartoon characters are well developed and because of that the 'Rat' aspect is soon forgotten and you are absorbed into the movie. The voices perfectly matched to the personality of the characters and can not be faulted in any way. The backdrop of Paris is done so well it made me want to book a trip soon.The story is expertly told, and that combined with the other elements elevate this to the top of the list for cartoon movie storytelling. Hooray for Hollywood, they got it right and this will be around for years after its contemporaries are forgotten.",9,0,0,2 July 2007
To Rome With Love," If this is humor, then what is funny
","This movie was a waste of two hours of my time. Non-stop silliness is not humor. Good stars do not make a film, a screenplay is essential. I like Allen's films, some are more neurotic than others, some are poignant, some have a decent plot. This is mainly neurotic without any meaningful purpose other than to make a film and get some money coming in. I guess that after Midnight in Paris, which I considered very good and funny, that Allen has given up trying to do anything creative. Allen and the stars must be laughing themselves silly about having anyone with any sense of critically rating a movie would find this anything other than other than one worn out clich√© after the other. I hope that this is not Allens last film, I would hate to see him go out with this exposing his own neurotic-ism one scene after the other in an awful screenplay.",6,9,18,16 July 2012
The Lives of Others," As near perfect as movies get.
","I was disappointed when Pan's Laybrinth didn't get the Academy Award for the best foreign film of 2006, but then I hadn't had a chance to see this movie. I'm an avid movie goer for the last 60 years and I have just about seen every worthwhile movie made. This movie is as good as any other movie I have seen if not better. It is by far the best movie made since the turn of the millennium if not for all time.If you are looking for a typical 'Hollywood' formula movie then you had best not go to see this one. But, if you are looking for sublime movie making in every respect then this is the movie made for you. It doesn't matter if the movie is in German the subtitles are excellent and along with the acting and direction a perfect story is told. Support excellence in movie making by putting this movie on the top of your list to see this year.",10,9,14,24 March 2007
The Reader," Hanna was Victimizer and Victim
","The German psyche is complicated, and so is this movie. There are no easy answers as to what motivates the characters. There are hints of shame, pedagogy, and nationalism.The German psyche was ripe for Adolph Hitler and his hatred of the Jews. Out of this hatred was born National Socalism which expressed with some pride an answer to the shame that was felt by a people who had to create a superior race to overcome losing World War I.Hanna, who to me is the most interesting of the characters, is whether by genetics or upbringing not capable of abstract thinking. To her there is right and wrong and nothing in between. She cannot see of what she has no awareness.Filled with her own personal shame for being illiterate, she lands in a job where to follow orders is equated with rightfulness. She is young like many who wind up in the military and do not have the benefit of self awareness to differentiate herself from her pedagogy. She admits to horrible things because she did not herself see them as horrible but as her duty. She feels no guilt using and sending prisoners to die who's only value is to read to her.She is amoral, not capable of empathy.Her final shame comes when she learns to read and write and is shamed for her lack of intellectual empathy. She cannot face this final shaming and kills herself.Michal, her young lover, is only important to the story because of his contrasts to Hanna.This is a well made movie, one that over time I predict will become a classic.",9,2,4,19 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I'm not very excited about this.....
","The good thing about this movie is that it tied the two trilogies together and explained Darth Vader's fall from grace.I loved the first trilogies, they were new explorations in film making. But special effects of the kind in this movie have long reached their zenith and are today old hat. Fewer obvious special effects, and more real scenes set in real places would have served the audience better.I thought that most of the movie was average at best. For the first half hour I felt like I was in someones living room while they played video games on their Play Station, except with very good surround sound and I could only watch. The early battle scenes were not necessary and probably only put in to sell video games. It had the feel of a video game.A movie can't have good acting unless a movie has a good script, I'm afraid that the actors were let down by the script. Many of the scenes were overly melodramatic at times, and there weren't many laughs that succeeded in breaking the tension. Even the devoted fans who stood in long lines weren't laughing during my showing.This movie did not make my hair stand on end like the first ones did, and I have a lot less hair these days. Maybe its my age, I just couldn't relate.",5,1,2,19 May 2005
Munich," Some people won't want you to see this movie.....
","This is a movie that some people won't want you to see because it gets beyond the simplistic propaganda of the media, and self-righteous introjected beliefs of our parents. It is a reality that goes beyond wishful thinking.It is not a movie of hope in the naive sense, but hopeful in the sense that just maybe we can raise the consciousness in the world that we can at least respond to the situation with sanity.Violence, complicity, duplicity, manipulation and paradox will make this movie a challenge to the belief systems of those who prefer to take in their information about the world from single sources.Look beyond the ratings of this movie, those that would prefer things not to change will not like it. I was never bored although the movie is long, and I was entertained although the movie was very serious.",10,3,9,26 December 2005
