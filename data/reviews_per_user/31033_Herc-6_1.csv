Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I liked it a lot - Brilliant film - Not as good as SW Ep4
","I really liked this film but didn't find it as good as SW - A New Hope...but hey we have to remember that this is only one part of an incomplete trilogy.It was very entertaining and has left me waiting impatiently for the follow up (Episode 2). Lucas, in my opinion, has done it yet again with a pod race-tastic filmÂ… Brilliant.My main complaint is that the musical score could have been a bit more like that of which was heard in episodes 4,5 and 6.",Null,0,0,18 July 1999
