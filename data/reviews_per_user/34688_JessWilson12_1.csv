Black Swan," Brilliant! Not for everyone but sensational
","OK, first of all this movie wont be for everyone. That much is obvious. I see some people on here have deemed this a horror/drama/thriller movie (and one Japanese horror which is ludicrous!!). In my opinion it is a psychological thriller. The demise of Natalie Portman's character is one of pure beauty and horror. Coupled with the influence of Kunis and Cassel's characters is simply brilliant. Full credit goes to the actors, if the Kings Speech wasn't so good (apparently) then I would tip this for a clean sweep at the Oscars. The dedication of Portman and Cunis to train and diet for this is fab because, lets be honest, they were very thin. Portman especially did not look well!The sex scene(s) are graphic yes but that, plus the few jumpy and creepy bit only adds to the intensity of the destruction of the mind. Can't praise this enoughLike I say, it wont be for everyone but then what film is?10/10 and I would see it again",9,1,4,23 January 2011
