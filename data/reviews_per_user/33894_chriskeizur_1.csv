Hereditary," Captivating take on grief
","During the inciting incident in 'Hereditary' (no spoilers, but anyone who has seen the film will know what I am talking about) I drooled on myself. I was so captivated and stunned by what I was seeing, that my jaw literally dropped. Ari Aster's debut feature length film gets its hooks into you early, and keeps you engrossed throughout. It's a moody flick, that follows some of the tried and true practices of horror-greats without ever feeling like a retread. In fact, if you are looking for a popcorn scary movie that will have you shouting with fright at jump scares and gratuitous gore, then stay away. But nonetheless those patient enough will find this movie will have you squirming in your seat. The cinematography is inventive, with lots of dynamic shots and clever incorporation of the main character's profession of designing dioramas. At times, it becomes difficult to tell if what you are looking at is real or not - something the characters struggle with themselves. And the acting is a shining triumph in this film, and one that should be recognized come award season. Gabriel Byrne and Milly Shapiro are both delightful, with the later shaking off the narrative that child actors can bring a performance down, while Alex Wolff does a decent job (despite some strange crying). But the standout star is Toni Collette, who portrays the mother Annie. She is so visceral in this movie, and whenever she is on set the film elevates into a whole other level. Her performance during a scene around the dinner table is one of the best moments in acting I have ever watched. 'Hereditary' is a strong movie that continues the recent trend of horror films breaking into prestige territory - much to my chagrin, a self-professed coward. It shows how grief can seep into a home and infect and warp those touched by it.",10,2,3,23 June 2018
