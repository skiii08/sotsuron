Requiem for a Dream," It's hard to watch, but it's worth it.
",It's really hard to watch. It gives very effective messages on substance abuse. It also brings heavy criticism to the pharmaceutical and medical sectors. You can be quite surprised to learn that the music we have been listening to for years is made for this film. Shooting techniques allow you to get involved in the story and increase the film's fascination.,9,0,0,12 July 2019
Gravity," A Complete Cinema
",Alfonso Cuaron has done a very high level of technical work. Particularly in the first half hour you are severely stretched. The use of long plans made sense. These long plans allow you to focus more on the film and experience the horror of those astronauts. Watching on a small screen becomes a disaster. You need to watch on a very good screen. It is a great lesson to have such an impressive film from such a small subject and a simple script. The realism part can of course be discussed. Music is great to use. The song in the film's finale is really good.,10,0,0,29 November 2019
The Irishman," It might be a different movie than you'd expect.
","We waited a long time for this film. Expectations have risen considerably. There were people waiting for a new The Godfather. But it looks more like a documentary shot. Martin Scorsese's style is reflected in this film. It has a similar narrative style to Goodfellas. The shots are impressive, but simple continuity errors have been made in editing some scenes. There's nothing exciting about it being biographical.I liked the use of CGI technology for Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. For Robert De Niro, it wasn't complete. I can't say masterpiece, but it's worth watching. He could fit in two and a half hours.",9,2,7,28 November 2019
Troy," Why not in top 250?
",Actually it is one of the best movies i ever watched but it seems imdb users didnt like it. Wonderful historical theme and epic war scenes.,9,3,6,28 December 2018
Lost in Translation," Sofia Coppola has done a good job
","I didn't see Sofia Coppola as an important director. I can't say that I liked her movies I've seen before. But I found this movie quite mature. It is impossible not to be impressed by the beauty and acting of the young Scarlett Johansson. It's not a very deep story, and it's also simple to predict what will happen. But you still want to watch and finish the movie because the tempo is very well adjusted. Bill Murray's performance is great.",9,1,1,28 November 2019
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Epic and Impressive!
","I think this film is one of the most impressive films of silent cinema. The actress, who played the role of 'Jeanne d'Arc', performed at a high level. Although the film is silent, the orchestral music playing in the background increases the power of the film. One of the main points that make the film legend is the use of a camera. Close-up is often preferred. These close-up scenes are like a cinema course. The camera angles used in the film are very brave and the reference point for someone who will learn the camera angles today. It was the right choice to tell not the whole life of her, just a small part of her life. It is impossible for even a stranger like me to be impressed while watching this film about a French and Christian cultural figure like Jeanne d'Arc. For those of you who don't know, I suggest you find out who Jeanne d'Arc is before you watch the film.",10,2,3,1 December 2019
The Godfather: Part II," Best Picture
","Best movie of cinema history. Acting,script and directing are awesome",10,2,2,27 December 2018
Toy Story 4," Better than I expected
","This sequel, which came after many years, is satisfying in terms of script and fluency. Pleasurable.",8,0,1,8 July 2019
Saving Private Ryan," Amazing
",A masterpiece that clearly reveals the reality of war. Inspiration of dozens of films,10,0,0,27 December 2018
The Lion King," It wasn't necessary.
","I was disappointed as a big fan of the original film. It doesn't mean it's better to film it more technologically. It's a story where animals talk, cry, sing. For this reason, the images in documentary reality are meaningless. They knew the curiosity of the fans of the old film and took such a risk. For those who haven't seen the old movie, it's a waste of time.",6,0,1,24 November 2019
Mulholland Drive," For people who love hard
","The film contains a lot of complexity. It's hard to comprehend which events are real. When the analysis written on it is read, it is clear that the script is written with extraordinary skill. In the second viewing, it's likely to become your favorite movie",10,2,3,8 July 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Like a comic book
",The film contains serious irrationality and exaggeration. The director does this willingly. Scenes with animation and titles shown before scenes show that they are not in vain.,8,0,2,8 July 2019
Blood Diamond," It's a cheap scenario for such a good subject.
","It is a pity that the story, which has such a striking subject, is full of clichés. The acting is fine. Exaggerated to over dramatize. If stereotypes were not included, it could have been a masterpiece.",8,1,1,9 July 2019
Joker," Satisfying from many points
",This film impressed me as a spectator who did not like superhero films. Art management and Joaquin Phoenix's performance deserve great prizes. It's more like a Taxi Driver than a superhero movie. The music reflects the psychological mood of the film well throughout the film. It's ridiculous for the film writers to create such a low Metascore from a sociological perspective. The weakness of the film is that the script is clichÃ©. I think the events in the Joker's madness are exaggerated.,8,1,3,24 November 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Good but a little overrated.
","The film has a nice tempo and I think it's quite smooth. It is also impossible for a film with Emmanuel Lubezki and Alejandro G. Iñárritu to be visually bad. But when you say 'The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance' you think you're going to watch a very philosophical movie. I also find it unnecessary to try to make the film look like a single shot. The long plans of Emmanuel Lubezki's Gravity and Children of Men with Alfonso Cuaron were much more meaningful. Acting is fine. You have to watch it, but not to exaggerate.",8,1,2,28 November 2019
