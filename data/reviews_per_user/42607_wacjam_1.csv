Resident Evil: Afterlife," Where were the Zombies???
","For me personally this movie was a major disappointment. I consider myself a fan of all things Zombie. Being such I believe Zombie movies should include 'Zombies' as a main part of the film. Unfortunately in this movie the Zombies were used basically as a morbid backdrop at best.Resident Evil Afterlife was more about Annie's ongoing battle with the Umbrella Corporation and its waves and waves of armed guards. It began looking like a cheap rip-off of the Matrix trilogy from years gone by. Even their new Umbrella Corp. 'bad guy' seems to be invincible like the Agents in the Matrix.The Zombies themselves (although true to the game) have taken on a new squid faced appearance turning their looks into something more like a bastard child of Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean) apposed to a traditional Zombie.If you are looking for a true representation of the video game you'll probably be pleased with this movie, but if you are looking for a great Zombie flick you just might end up being as disappointed as I was.I guess I'll have to wait for World War Z for my next Zombie fix... I just hope it turns out better than Afterlife did.",1,31,62,13 September 2010
