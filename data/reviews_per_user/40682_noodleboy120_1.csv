The Blair Witch Project," it WAS scary!
","i can understand why a lot of people hate this movie. not much happens, all hand held camera work. But just forget about all that.Go with the movie and watch as these 3 people lose it to the unknown. It's what you don't see thats scary.And the ending is truly freaky stuff!!",Null,0,1,18 December 1999
