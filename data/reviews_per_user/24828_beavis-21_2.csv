The Blair Witch Project," kind of disapointment
","I've notice only one week ago that the movie actually existed. After having seen the trailer, I've been facinated by the movie and after having red a few things about it on the net, I was convinced that it would be the first movie ever to scare me up and the fitst horror movie to disturb me. Well, not at all. I don't think I've been scare more than ten seconds at all in the movie. But it's still a really great movie. I've been impressed by the cast performance, I felt the tension rising and I've loved all the dialogues, especially from Heather, witch provided pretty funny moments. However, I do get why people vomited in several teathers. It's not because of the emotional charge but because of the hand camera effets, always moving one side to the other, enought to give everybody who gets disturb in a simulator a nausea. Maybe that's what broke my trill. I was actually hoping the movie ends fast. I had to close my eyes every minutes for 10 seconds to make the nausea pass. Maybe it will be the first movie actually more trilling to watch on video.",8,1,1,31 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," big, expensive piece of bulls..t
","I've waited close to an hour outside the cinema to see it. Not because I had great expectations of the movie(I got a big feeling I wasn't going to like it) but because I didn't want to be the only person in North America not having seen it. I don't think I have even smiled  once during the projection, not like the group behind me which applauded when the previews began, when the previews ended, when the Lucas Films logo apeared, everytimes Lucas's name apeared when R2D2, 63PO, Anakin... have been introduced in the movie and at the end of the movie. Then, the first thing I've heard was from my 13 years old brother saying the movie was nothing more than an insult to his intelligence(in french). The truth is that the movie was purely a mix of things that worked well in episodes 4,5 and 6 as a result, a movie made for less than ten years old, filled with plates, easy jokes (witch are not funny at all) and characters made to sell stuff at McDonald.  I just feel angry against the big Star War fans saying this is the best movie of all time. They know it's not true, they were ready, I guess, to say that way before the production of the movie had started cause nobody over 10 years old can seriously think it.",4,0,1,27 May 1999
