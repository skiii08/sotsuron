Hereditary," Nope.
","Don't get me wrong. This could have been a great movie. The acting is brilliant, the cinematography amazing for this type of movie. It doesn't frighten you with cheap jump-scares, it's more the psychological horror that makes you uncomfortable.I don't understand the high rating on this movie. Haunting of Hill House got a 9 from me, but definitely not Hereditary.But I agree with another review beforehand and need to note the following:<ul><li>You don't send a 13 year old to a high school party with a senior. Nor would you just take your sister without an argument. You also would have an Epi pen on you at all times, if an allergy was THAT severe.</li></ul><ul><li>To quote what someone else wrote: 'People who just decapitated their sibling in an auto accident don't simply drive home, go to bed, and leave a human head on the ground ... Additionally, when this kind of thing happens, the cops tend to get involved...? In this movie, however, that's exactly what happens and no police, no cleanup and they're driving the car in the very next scene.' That. So much that.</li></ul><ul><li>'When your son, who has weeks or days earlier killed your daughter, resumes going to school almost immediately, without therapy or counselling, has a seizure and bashes his own face in on the desk, you don't load his lifeless body into the same Volvo, drive him home, and deposit him into his bed - still unconscious - without any kind of medical consultation or observation at all.' 100% agreed.</li></ul><ul><li>The plot is about....satanists (including the grandma) getting a demon into this world, Paimon? And to give him the appropriate body, the brother has to accidentally kill the possessed child and then inn the end throw himself out of the window and die himself ? That's the twist, really? Not very innovative, and lazy execution with major plotholes.</li></ul><ul><li>In the end I felt weird about the entire movie. It wasn't a dumb, scary movie. It started off as a psychological thriller, a drama, and got really strange to the point where I felt weird myself.</li></ul>",4,1,2,2 November 2019
The King," Epic.
","You should know that this movie is based on historical events and Shakespeare's Play Henry V, with some changes and additions. The original play ended with the unison, but in the movie there was a (very enjoyable) twist to the end.
Henry V was one of the greatest warrior kings of medieval England, particularly known for the Battle of Agincourt.If you expect a highly accurate historical piece, don't watch it, maybe read a book about Henry V instead or watch a documentary.Brilliant acting, great visuals/costumes & cinematography - and overall stunning storytelling.Highly recommend watching it!",9,5,8,3 November 2019
Black Panther," How did this movie get so much positive praise?
","If you are going to watch a Marvel movie, you know you are not going in for THE cinematic experience of the year or an intelligent, clever plot. To put it simply, Marvel is entertainment.Thor: Ragnarok was a delight. The director Waititi ('Hunt for the Wilderpeople' and 'What we do in the shadows') played a huge role in that, personally I just love his sense of humour. Even if you don't enjoy that quirkiness - it was still a good story, good dialogues and a visual eye-candy.Somehow it is 7.9, while this movie is 7.8. 
How did that happen?Black Panther is stale nonsense. The dialogues are horrific, the acting not worth mentioning and as for the characters...I didn't care about a single one. 
The storyline entirely predictable, the 'big bang' in the end a joke. 
The movie tries to be cool (Constant Hip hop beats, flying an airship in yoga position) and utterly fails in that respect.",4,0,3,7 April 2018
