The Expendables 2," Most Entertaining Action Movie In Years
","I postponed watching this movie as the original, although good enough to watch, did not give as much 'in your face' OTT as I had hoped. The sequel however delivered this in abundance! The additions of Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme were a brilliant choice and extended roles for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger were much appreciated.This was old school action at its best, guns, bombs, knives and fists took up the best part of the film and the dialogue was perfectly cheesy throwing in a lot of well received references.This is possibly the most fun I have had watching an action film in my life let alone the last few years. I do understand some people feel the story was lacking and the puns were too much but it adds much more memorability and banter with the lads! I am happy to hear there will be a 3rd instalment and pray that the legends of the genre once again deliver 'a real mans film' (being PC this is just an expression of course, I'm sure many women enjoy this type of film :D). I've missed movies like this as film makers have added a more 'thriller' feel to modern action flicks. SOMETIMES I JUST WANT TO SEE PEOPLE BLOWING SH*T UP!!!TLDR?: Thoroughly entertaining :)",9,2,3,28 March 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An Unexpectedly Great Journey!
","Sat at the cinema with no intervals (the movie started late) my bum was extremely numb by the end, but who cares because this film was well worth it. After reading then watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy I was slightly disappointed about the amount of stuff that had to be cut out to fit in 3 films. I am extremely glad that this will not be the case with The Hobbit. Some might believe there is not enough action and adventure involved but avid Tolkien fans will be more than pleased with the attention to detail this film provides. Although there are parts that are slightly altered (as with most every book-film) the majority of it is as if the words have jumped out of page and onto screen. The casting was great, Freeman played a convincing Bilbo, of course Sir Ian McKellen was excellent and I am a small fan of Richard Armitage and James Nesbitt and felt they were a healthy addition. The acting was very good as expected and the performance of the songs was perfect (especially Thorin's song).I eagerly await the second part of the film based on an incredible piece of literature.",9,1,5,28 March 2013
