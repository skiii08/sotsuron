United 93," Overrated
","I recently saw this film and I have to say that this is one of the most overrated movies ever. I simply don't get how everyone you ask says this is one of the most touching movies ever.Cause it's not.I want to make this clear. I don't think it is a bad movie. Not by a long shot! It is one of the better movies of the year, by far. I'm just saying all the buzz about it is a bunch of crap. Some people may find this movie touching. Mostly Americans, but others too. But I didn't see what is so good about it. It's a bunch of people on a hijacked plane. Not to interesting, if you ask me.Is it a bad movie? No. I certainly think it will be nominated for a couple Oscars, and it rightfully should be. It's just a shame that it's probably gonna sweep the Oscars, which it shouldn't. cause it's not a super-great movie.",6,2,8,15 May 2006
