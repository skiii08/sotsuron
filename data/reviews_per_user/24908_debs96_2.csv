It," A little bit of everything
","IT made for great viewing on the big screen, and was the first horror movie I went to see for years. IT has a bit of everything- scares, suspense, humour and a great cast. I havent watched the original (series) so I cant compare them, but I really liked this movie and chapter 2 is out very soon!",8,0,0,29 August 2019
Us," What a waste of time
","I dont know where to begin, this movie was just plain BAD. I knew it wouldnt be as good as Get Out, but this really done a 360 instead. I was so excited to watch Us after seeing the trailer, but what I actually watched was a hot mess. I laughed a few times, and it was due to complete cringey moments. There were too many plot holes to even keep count, and the script was also pretty poor at times. None of the characters are all that likeable, and the 'twist' ending failed to phase me, I just thought it was such a cheap explanation. I sat waiting for something to happen but the film was very dragged out, it did not have to be so long. Im SO glad I didnt pay to see this one in cinemas because im gutted enough that I wasted 2 hours of my life watching it as it is! The critics overhyped this title majorly, AVOID AVOID AVOID",3,2,3,28 August 2019
