The Blair Witch Project," Stolen plot alert! Garbage breeds garbage.
","Original? Please.  The whole 'idiots-go-into-the-forest-(or jungle)-and-film-their-own-harrowing-ordeal-which-is-later-discovered-and-shown-to-a-shocked-audience' has been done before.  Look up 'Cannibal Holocaust' in the IMDb or see the film.  Actually, don't, it's just as bad as this garbage.Stolen plot aside, this film simply was NOT scary (for me.)  I think for a film to be scary one must care about the characters.  Personally, I cannot muster sympathy for such blockheads.  I found myself saying 'Just kill them so we can all go home.'  The sad thing is that so many mallrats let the media tell them that this was the thing to enjoy, and thus, a BIG HIT at the box office.  Break out of your heard and see an intelligent film about intelligent people!I also cannot believe that anyone actually thought this was real!  I mean, if it was we would have heard about it and the footage would never have been seen.  Gees!  The things people will fall for!Skip this, and go to the Sundance Channel section at Blockbuster and pick up something by Atom Egoyan or Mina Shum instead.",Null,0,1,5 July 2000
Scream," Quite a feat, delightfully genre-bending.
","Director Wes Craven, and writer Kevin Williamson have quite effectively bended horror genre conventions to create a clever, tight, suspense-filled film.  Just as the audience believes they know what is about the occur, the filmmakers twist you in the opposite direction.  The protagonist, Sidney Prescott, differs from the norm as a horror heroine in that she has dealt with trauma in her past, and is smart and strong, definately not your typical screamer.  Clues as to who the antogonist is are dropped throughout the film, but in such a way the audience wanders down the wrong path consistantly until the final revelation in the last reel.  Scores above any other horror film in recent memory.",Null,0,0,2 August 1998
