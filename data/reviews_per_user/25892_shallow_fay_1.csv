Sucker Punch," OK, if you're looking for action
","I felt this movie was beautiful. The graphics were really cool, the fight scenes were well-done (the variety made the movie not flow that well, but they all probably would have worked well in different movies), and the girls were pretty hot (lol) but over-all the plot... sagged.It was kind of like a video game, goal achieved BA-ding! repeat. I was disappointed at Babydoll's dance or rather our lack of seeing it. I was disappointed by how Babydoll gets the other girls to agree to her plan with little to no resistance despite the situation. The premise was unique, I'll give it that (though.. a dream within a dream within a dream seems kinda familiar).I was so excited for this movie and I left the theater feeling ripped off.",5,0,2,3 June 2011
