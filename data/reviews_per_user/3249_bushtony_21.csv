The Avengers," It's good for what it is..and what it is is OK by me...
","It's good-enough entertainment for what it is, and what it is is OK by me.Ultimately a CGI superhero bun fight with lots of noise and eye-melting visual FX. Indeed, there is some significant measure of wit and gravitas in the principal performances and it's altogether, in summation, a very jolly, non-threatening and unchallenging exercise in popcorn artistry on a grand scale. And you know pretty much how it's going to end before it begins. So no need to worry about any of the characters or invest too much concern or emotional currency.Worthy of all the hype, resultant adulation and strikingly impressive box office cash-cow achievement? Probably not. But then that's an impossible reputation to live up to. It's never going to be as good as it's made out to be in terms of most people's honest expectations - even if they feel they can't admit it - but then again, whatever is? The first hour is moderately tedious and draggy and takes it's own sweet time about re-introducing characters, thumbnail sketching them, and setting up the story. A bunch of aliens are waging war on the world, coordinated by Thor's evil brother Loki. The world in this case is Manhattan. Why? Who knows. Just is. Only a brave but mismatched band of spandex-wearing, armour-clad, god-like or accidentally mutated super-dudes stand in their way. Not exactly original as narratives go, but it's only a hook to hang the CGI action on after all. It's not there to be inventive or innovative. Complexity need not apply in this particular universe.The whole point is the action - a dynamic eye-candy smörgåsbord of fights, explosions, gunfire, detonating machinery, devastation and mayhem in all it's high-spec CGI glory. A beautiful computerised cartoon of dazzlingly destructive technical wizardry. And on this score it delivers impeccably.Kudos to the cast for instilling some crucial human elements into the characters they play, deftly aided and abetted by some astute dialogue from Whedon. The sly and self-aware way in which he overloads the exchanges between Stark and Banner with meaningless technological gibberish that he just knows is utter rubbish is very smartly satirical. Arch cardboard ciphers made self-knowing and appealing. In terms of the characters, though, what strikes most is out of all of them the one who ends up being the most emotionally engaging, charismatic and sympathetic is the one who is a complete CGI render - The Hulk. Maybe this says something pertinent about modern cinema and modern movie acting. Food for thought, perhaps? As superhero movies go, it's amusing, entertaining, watchable and spectacularly burns into the retinas with the best of them. Better than BATDUDE or SPIDERGUY? Subjective, but I enjoyed it more than a lot of the other stuff around. There are long stretches of boredom in most superhero movies, but apart from the (probably necessary) preamble, AVENGERS avoids the customary slog. The fact of the matter is that when superheros in superhero flicks are not doing their stuff as superheros in superhero flicks there ain't much of great interest going on. And it can bore.AVENGERS is a Michael Bay movie with wit, charm, some heart and care and more of a brain in the driving seat. Whedon taps into the consciousness of the crowd in order to understand what makes a crowd pleaser. He's a smart guy who has studied the psychology and identified where people like Bay and Emmerich get it wrong, thus avoiding those pitfalls and getting it mostly right.I enjoyed it. I'll probably watch it again and enjoy it again. After that, though, doubt it will need a further revisit any time soon.",7,4,9,8 September 2012
The Expendables 2," Expendable Fun
","Um, right. Pretty much non-stop action, violence, shooting, explosions, chases, blood, guts, fights, rampant mayhem and a script drenched in more corn and cheese than you could shake a battery farm full of egg laying chickens dipped in Edam at. Most of the Expendables could be more aptly termed the Expandables, and they certainly show their age in front of the unflinching eye of the camera lens – which quite brutally exposes more plastic work, face and eye lifts than a Joan Rivers lookalike convention. Statham looks the most normal and less of a bloated cartoon caricature out of the older contingent, but then he's younger than they are. A mere pup.It thinks it's funnier and cleverer than it is and it thinks it's a lot more fun to watch than it is. There's something a bit sad about it all, probably because it fails to acknowledge that these guys ain't the young buck action heroes they once were and treats them as if they were still at the top of their game. If the comedy and satire focused on their advanced ages maybe it would be a touch more endearing. But it doesn't really and it isn't.The jokes and quips are a bit flat and come over as if they were just made up as the shoot rolled along. The script sounds random and improvised, so it's not exactly a tightly wound machine. There's no way that a cast list like this is not going to be of interest, but the idea of it is a lot better than the actual experience and execution.If thick-eared self-aggrandising action fantasy semi-parody is your bag, and you like seeing a bunch of pensioners all getting together to kick ass, it will appeal. Just don't expect too much other than a moderately engaging action movie time-filler trading heavily on the past glories of some of its cast. Not essential viewing, more expendable fun, if you will.",6,0,0,1 November 2012
Skyfall," Nobody Does It Better - Ever
","Nobody does it better. Everybody with an ounce of sense knows this. But just to dispel any doubt, EoN immaculately raise the qualitative bar for the modern action movie/espionage fantasy thriller once again and Bond blows away the competition just like that. The doom-mongers, naysayers, whingers, whiners, gloom-merchants and malodorous Bond misanthropes have got it wrong again.SKYFALL is good. Very good. It taps effortlessly into the pop culture iconography and history of a fifty-year old movie franchise sparingly and with thoughtfulness and care. Then, with deadly accuracy and magnificent potency, updates and upgrades it to fashion one of the most audacious and dynamic Bond movies ever made.Painstakingly choreographed action set-pieces litter the film strategically. They are framed by and rendered in some of the most dazzlingly beautiful cinematography to ever grace the franchise. Truly a feast for the eyes. The neon and glass track-down and hand-to-hand combat sequence with Patrice in Shanghai is one of the most sublimely original and retina blistering events I have ever seen on screen. Yet this is not even the best bit of the film.Sonically, it is both crisp and precise, with Thomas Newman's subtle and marvellously nuanced score complimenting the visuals to perfection. The music and sound effects match the visuals blow for blow in terms of aesthetic aspiration and achievement.Anyone with concerns that Sam Mendes might not have what it takes to direct an action movie need have no worries. Mendes is creatively inviolate here, his vision and sense of tone and dynamic is right on target, and he probably turns in what is technically his best and most consistently sustained job of screen work to date.As for the performances, some are near faultless. Craig, Dench, Fiennes, Bardem, Whishaw don't put a foot wrong. Craig, Dench and Bardem are especially notable. And Craig IS James Bond 007 in the here and now. He is the super-cool super-conductor, the core element of the entire film – and he is damn good at it.As a 50th anniversary item, SKYFALL pays skillful homage the franchise with pleasing nods and winks that are carefully reverent and respectful whilst retaining a playful, mildly satirical sense of humour. In some other movies, DIE ANOTHER DAY for instance, the approach was one of blunt sledge-hammering parody and was tediously crass and distasteful. Fans will get a big kick out of the use of the Aston Martin along the sly digs at the way in which gadgets for the sake of deus ex machina moments have become terminally passé, chronically outdated.The plot is relevant and suitably reinforces Bond's relevance in the modern world, so paving the way for future adventures. The payoff gives us a return to the way things used to be but in a modern and updated context, so anyone who was ever a fan should be deliriously happy about that and the way in which it provides Bond with somewhere to go – even if it turns out to be the line of least resistance in the long run. If - and it's a really big IF – but if the Oscars has a complete cultural and ethical transplant and actually started to give awards for real cinematic achievement rather than for morally bankrupt and intellectually corrupt reasons, SKYFALL would garner a limo-load of statuettes.Witty, clever, literate, smart, funny, some great dialogue, wonderful visuals, breathtaking action, good music, emotional punch and meaningful contextual architecture. It builds on the CASINO ROYALE reboot, the QUANTUM OF SOLACE conclusion to that thematic story arc, and consolidates it seamlessly into a fabulously intoxicating Bond cocktail, making it not just a great standalone piece of movie entertainment but a great and significantly important Bond movie.Nobody does it better. Indeed.",10,7,23,27 October 2012
Gravity," Tears In Zero Gravity
","The set-up is simplicity itself, you probably know what it's about, so let's not waste time with that.On the positive side it's gripping, fast-paced and involving. Visually, it is superb, one of the best–looking, best designed movies you're ever likely to see. Overall, an intense little thriller with some well-sustained edge-of-the-seat moments and a neat, quite brave twist as the one half of this superstar two-hander bows out half way through the running time. In some respects, the most interesting and charismatic of the two as it happens.On the downside, the dialogue is mostly doggerel – trite, manufactured and clunky. The hackneyed and stage-managed life-affirming epiphany bestowed on Bullock's insular grief-stricken character is both heavy-handed and monumentally unsubtle. And a bit gag-inducing to boot. I can do without references to a child's missing red shoe and knotted hair and conversations in the afterlife and all that phony corn-syrup coating.The two leads do relatively well with their cardboard cut-out roles. Clooney is his usual practised mix of macho smarm and sophisticated swagger. Bullock whinges and hyperventilates effectively all over the place whilst her frozen face is now surgically incapacitated beyond the remotest chance of projecting convincing emotional expressions.There are some great touches which could have delivered much more emotional impact. For instance, Bullock's tears floating in zero gravity. Now if only her face could have looked as if she were actually distressed and crying that would have been an amazing scene, rather than one that merely strikes as a very imaginative creative idea.Cuaron directs with confidence and style and he conveys a stunning atmosphere of outer-space realism with a convincing use of physics and dizzying camera-work. He makes it easy to believe in the on-screen environment he has created. Sadly, I found it a lot harder to believe in the characters. It's strange but true, little things like bad dialogue and blank facial expressions that don't fit dramatic situations can jolt you out of a carefully constructed and immersive cinematic environment, diminishing the experience somewhat.Bottom line, a solid, well-made, sci-fi flick with an ingenious narrative. Shame that shoddy characterisation and dialogue along with some self-imposed physical restrictions on the part of the lead-actress let it down. Could have been great, but wasn't. However, remains very good viewing despite the wasted potential.Ah, wasted potential. Always the worst cinematic crime.",7,0,2,13 December 2013
The Hunger Games," The Youth Of Today...
","The creative philosophy underpinning DEATH RACE 2000, ROLLERBALL, THE RUNNING MAN and others re-imagined here for the TWILIGHT tweenies. A survivalist action-drama set in a dystopian future, it does for bleak prophetic sci-fi bread and circus flicks what TWILIGHT did for vampire cinema. It's teen-trendy, twee, diluted and toothless. Vapid, unchallenging and oh-so safe with every punch tastefully pulled, every mock-emotional set-piece carefully orchestrated to tug the superficial heartstrings of the wannabe emo self-harmer brigade. Overlong. Really overlong. And it was tripe.What this stuff needs is jet-black humour and vengeful rebellion to make it work. For the protagonists to win and turn on the architects of their plight with guns. cudgels and knives and pulverise their asses in a climax of violence, retribution and destruction. Upon meeting Donald Sutherland's President, Katpiss should have stabbed him through the eyes with arrowheads and stamped the mockingjay pin into his nose with a jackboot. Then spat on his still twitching corpse.The youth of today. What the hell's the matter with them? Why did I watch this passionless, meaningless crap? It was new. It was in the house. I had time to kill. I'd heard some promising things about it. It was still against my better judgement, but I thought no, give it a chance. That'll learn me. Anything with the faintest hair-gelled aroma of TWILIGHTism about it, keep the hell away.",3,4,6,1 September 2012
Silent Hill," Dear God, where will it end?
","With a wealth of technology at their disposal, with the backing of major studios, with a sea of class 'A' horror/fantasy material written, ready and waiting to be developed for the screen, it challenges belief that filmmakers seem singularly unable to make decent horror/fantasy movies anymore. What really bugs me (just as a brief example) is that no one has yet produced a satisfactory movie of Richard Mathesons' seminal 'I Am Legend' or even attempted William Hope Hodgesons' 'The House on the Borderland' or Clive Barker's 'Weaveworld' or Ramsey Campbell's 'Ancient Images' (well, in Campbell's case, anything he's ever written). Written works of tremendous quality and potential exist out there, just begging to be developed.The earlier, stark and visceral approaches of directors such as John Carpenter, George A. Romero, Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven and others seems to have been diluted these days (even by themselves). They either produce nothing at all, or crank out sanitised re-imagined versions of past glories.Compare 'Land of the Dead' with 'Day of the Dead,' or 'Ghosts of Mars' with 'The Thing' or 'Red Eye' with 'The Hills Have Eyes.' What's going on? As Hitchcock aged he matured as a director, as a creator and purveyor of suspense on a visual-emotional level. Granted, his last movie 'Family Plot' was tripe, but the penultimate 'Frenzy' was a classic serial killer thriller with some wonderfully manipulative set pieces. He lost none of his creative powers right up until the near end of his life. So, what is going on? Film makers (due to market forces, or youth culture, or whatever) appear bent on feeding us bloodless, disinfected remakes ('The Fog,' 'When a Stranger Calls') or glossy throwaway fodder based on video games. Seemingly, as the video game has evolved into a media 'art form' of its own with a significant and growing penetration into the youth market, it has become, along with the comic book or graphic novel, the preferred source material over the written word. And so we are served up flashy, nonsensical garbage that eschews narrative drive and the creative development of suspense and shocks in favour of tenuously related CGI set-pieces strung together by inane dialogue telegraphed through wooden cipher-performances from actors who really should know better. Still, a buck's a buck. The preceding paragraph sums up for me the movie version of 'Silent Hill.' To truly enjoy this film you'll need to be about ten years old, play video games in a darkened room, have never read a book in your life (apart from the one about Spot the dog), never seen a truly great horror/fantasy movie (or if you did, dismiss it because of a lack of CGI), get easily confused by an episode of 'The Simpsons' to the point where following a plot line for anything becomes superfluous to your enjoyment and you must have no idea of what good film making is about. This movie is just soso cynical. Sean Bean, for instance, autopilots through his role in such an uninvolved and uncaring fashion that you know he's just doing it for the money. The same as everyone else involved. The writers have made no attempt to structure the plot in any meaningful way  it's disjointed, fragmented and has no focus whatsoever. I agree that a film needs a beginning and a middle and an end, and not necessarily in that order, but there should be some attempt to instill a degree of depth and quality, some emotion into the process that engages with the audience. Nope, 'fraid not. It's loud, sterile, about as scare inducing as a buttercup with as much life in it as a quick-dissolving aspirin. You don't care about the characters  unless you have a particular emotional attachment for cardboard cut-outs  and ultimately watching is a tedious process that is much like chewing celery sandwiched between balsa wood, only using your eyes and ears instead of your mouth and tongue.Hitchcock's 'The Birds,' Carpenter's 'The Thing,' Romero's original 'Dead' trilogy, Hooper's 'Chainsaw,' Dario Argento's 'Suspiria,' - 'Carrie,' 'Pet Semetary,' 'Halloween,' 'Psycho,'  anything that uses the language of cinema to communicate something of relevance and meaning and entertain by so doing. Watch anything but 'Silent Hill.' Dear God, where will it end?",1,10,21,19 August 2006
The Amazing Spider-Man," Amazingly Average
","It wasn't all dark, doomy, terminally introspective and morbidly fatalistic like Nolan's Batdude exercises in bloated style over content and self-absorbed guilt-tripping. Neither was it quite as fun as Raimi's earlier initial updated comic-book take. So, it lands itself in the middle ground between the two and turns out to be...well...middling.There are some tweaks to the back story, involving Peter Parker's parents picking a peck of pickled peppers. Or, rather, dying in suspicious circumstances linked to Oscorp. And the love interest shifts away from Mary-Jane to comic book second stringer Gwen Stacy. Andrew Garfield looks goofier than Tobey Maguire due to unfeasible teeth and has a blander and less convincing way of delivering dialogue. Rhys Ifans looks and acts like a man just there for the cash, fully realising that he's merely a villain-cipher in a sea of green screen. A lot of the time he looks as if he's going to burst out laughing at the absurdity of it all. It's not that he's bad, more that he doesn't seem to care that much and is therefore simply going through the motions and waiting for payday. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are decent enough, looking happy to still be in gainful employment, and they do lend an air of humanity and characterisation to their roles in the proceedings.Standout for me is Emma Stone as Gwen – who is absolutely gorgeous and cute and emotionally astute. She lights up every scene she's in and never gives the impression of being contrived or fake in her performance.Like THE AVENGERS it's a mass of CGI, which is par for the course these days. Some of it is convincing, but a lot of it looks continuously unnatural, and where THE AVENGERS had a clever sense of self-aware humour to act as a buffer against the intrusion of the SFX pulling you out of the moment, SPIDER-GUY doesn't have that same creative mindset.I'm really getting tired of this superhero CGI stuff. I gave this a spin because it was available and I picked it up at random. It filled a viewing space, and I wouldn't have gone out of my way to see it. It is neither offensively bad nor astonishingly good - just amazingly average.",5,1,3,25 December 2012
The Exorcist," Pure Cinema - 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray
","Having just taken delivery of the 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray edition and watched the director's cut I am reminded fully of just why this is one of the most influential and important motion pictures ever made. The longer cut (by 11 minutes) doesn't add that much to the theatrical version (also included) apart from a minimal feeling of having watched a slightly more complete and thorough presentation. But, really, it's neither here nor there.The plot is simple. Daughter of actress single mother is possessed by an evil spirit (may or may not be the devil), an Old Catholic priest intervenes to perform an exorcism and he's accompanied by a young modern Jesuit priest experiencing a crisis of faith. Yes, simple. But the content, the events and the themes explored within are immensely complex and emotionally affecting.It's a tale of good versus evil, of the power of religious faith along with redemption through self- sacrifice. Now I'm not a religious person but even I was impressed by the compelling and matter-of-fact way the film seeks to reaffirm belief in the existence of both God and the Devil. And I still remain astonished at the amount of religiously oriented people, even today, who are offended by this film. Considering it works on an acceptance of God's existence and clearly shows good triumphing over the best efforts of malicious evil; how is that offensive exactly? What I personally find offensive, but admittedly unsurprising, is the number of people who haven't actually seen the film but feel qualified to critique and judge it. This is a testament to the closed-minded intolerance of religion and the power of media mythology. More powerful than God for some, it would seem.Undeniably, pure evil is depicted as monstrous, defiling, sick, twisted, malevolent and destructive. The host child is physically tortured and made to behave supernaturally and unspeakably. Well, what would anyone expect – a demon that just pops around for crumpets and afternoon tea with perhaps a sedate game of lawn croquet thrown in for a clincher?The deal here is, for those of a particularly media susceptible and narrow-minded nature and those who haven't seen it but know something of the reputation; put aside the myths and sensationalism surrounding THE EXORCIST. This stuff is causing you to miss out on experiencing a classic exercise in pure cinema.Friedkin (director) and Blatty (writer) employ almost peerless craftsmanship in structuring and executing this film. It represents the masterwork of both and they will probably never better it. There is some incredibly fine acting on show from Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb and Jason Miller. Not forgetting the best ever screen work of Linda Blair. As the possessed child she is a revelation. Whatever subsequent acting performance she gave as an adult it was, quite honestly, atrocious in comparison. Child actors are unselfconscious and blessed with monumental confidence and self-belief and the ability to imaginatively project. Some of them lose this when they grow up. Linda Blair certainly did. However, in THE EXORCIST, she was something else entirely.The screenplay by William Peter Blatty is one of the most carefully composed and atmospherically chilling pieces one could imagine. He draws each and every character as a three-dimensional human being and takes time over development. Quite remarkable, considering Blatty had been a hack comedy writer up to this point (he scripted, of all things, the Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau flick A SHOT IN THE DARK).Friedkin directs each shot with painstaking care and an eye for making the commonplace seem frightful and unsettling. Case in point is the scene when Ellen Burstyn is simply walking home in daylight. Autumn leaves blow along the street, kids trick-or-treating run by, the wind tugs the habits of some passing nuns, and Mike Oldfield's signature loop from 'Tubular Bells' plays in the background. It is really uncannily unnerving. And quite brilliant. Friedkin's choice of this particular music is inspired, but it's used very, very sparingly (only twice?) throughout the movie. Oldfield's piano repeat has a weird hook/tempo that the listener can never quite get their head around. This is what makes it addictive and unsettling and it gets into your head, stays there and helps set a unique tone.The audio visual tapestry Friedkin weaves builds steadily and seamlessly through a series of escalating events and the tension increases in sympathy. Owen Roizman's cinematography is absolutely magnificent, framing the story in a psychologically affecting range of strikingly beautiful textures and tones. Add the support of some immaculately subtle audio effects, the incredible vocalism of Mercedes McCambridge and some truly shocking but never arbitrary or exploitative sequences, and you have one of the most frightening and emotionally rewarding cinematic experiences ever committed to film.THE EXORCIST is one of those rarest phenomena; like PSYCHO, it's a movie that invokes strong feelings in anyone who sees it by intricately creating an atmosphere that is unrivalled in film. There has never been anything else quite like it. And probably never will be again. It's pure cinema and as such demands and deserves the attention it gets. Scrap the media-generated infamy and see it for what it is.The Blu-Ray print is a thing of impressive beauty – crisp, clean, fresh and vibrant. The director's cut has a very slight edge over the theatrical release, if only for providing the most complete viewing platform available. You get a lot of bang for your buck – commentary by Friedkin and Blatty, interviews, documentaries, trailers, all the usual suspects. Plus you get the theatrical cut thrown in. It's worth the dough.",9,1,2,28 October 2013
Quantum of Solace," Bonded To The Here, Now and Future
","QoS is the fastest moving, most visceral, bone-crunching, eye-wateringly stunt-laden Bond move yet made. Where CR was a roller-coaster ride with longish quieter stretches of track for contemplation, drama and character development, QoS is a roller-coaster ride with seriously reduced stretches of track and less respite. My guess is, that in response to the CR critics claiming that there is no place for character development in a Bond movie, that Bond shouldn't be too emotional, CR was too long, CR didn't have enough action or set-pieces, the producers have reacted with the shortest, punchiest, diamond-hardest staccato rap-attack they could muster. QoS is a continuous blast from beginning to end. This is the deal – if you want protracted and deliberate plot spoon-feeding, if you can't multi-task, if you are so pussy-whipped to a sissy state that searing, pulse pounding action cinema makes you close your eyes and cry, if you want a Jane Austen costume-drama, you won't get what you want from this film. If, like Chris Tookey of The Mail, you thought that CR was romantic art-house Bond, and romantic art-house cinema is what excites you, then you're going to find this boring in comparison. However, if you want the full-monty kick in the balls, sock in the jaw, rabbit punch to the kidneys, cinematic acid-burn to the eyeballs, gut-wrenching adrenaline rush to the synapses, you're going to have a great time. Craig is all business here, still a revelation as 007. He's not crying any longer (much). He's out to cut a swathe through the villains and despatch and destroy, burn and blow-up anything that gets in his path, or threatens to deflect him from it. Cool, muscular, sardonic, full of subtle nuances and mannerisms that communicate so much to the audience – provided they are paying attention, that is. He has now consolidated the domination of another strata of the character – that of the trained killer on a mission. He's perfected the art of dispensing death and destruction with a compelling brutal, cavalier elegance. An absolute joy to watch. As for the content of the film, here is a list of things that the pretenders (some of those delusional people who pretended to have seen it prior to release) got completely wrong: Camille does not die. Correct. Anyone who said so, didn't see the film and was lying through their scum sucking teeth. Bond does not resign at the end. (More later). Bond has not not gone completely rogue. He is supported and sanctioned by M for most of the film: 'He's my agent and I trust him.' There are some satisfyingly subtle quips and one-liners: 'Don't bleed to death.' 'She's sea sick.' Mathis: 'I think she has handcuffs.' Bond: 'I do hope so.' 'We're teachers on a sabbatical. We've just won the lottery.' 'Can I make a suggestion? Why don't you people find a better place to meet?' Camille: 'Your mother?' Bond: 'She likes to think so.' And more. As for Arnold's score, it's another triumph of mood, atmosphere and relevance. It pounds daringly during the action, emotionally compliments the quieter moments. The signatures drawn from the theme song are incorporated. As in CR, segments of the Bond theme itself is utilised at key moments throughout. The title sequence (banal theme song apart) is stark and hard-hitting, incorporating teasing hints of the Bond gun barrel into it's conception. The henchmen have little to do, but Dominic Greene is a fine, vile, villain. Oh, by the way, as far as the audience is concerned, he does die in the end. At Bond's orchestration. Pleasingly referenced are Goldfinger (Fields coated in oil – an irony, because 'there isn't any' oil). The Spy Who Loved Me (Sandor being held over the edge of a high building; the desert trek, etc). Any critic who states that the film consists of a series of completely random action sequences must have been watching something completely different – everything has a logical place, purpose and rationale within the narrative. Plus, anyone who couldn't follow the plot, which is clearly obvious and well defined throughout, has a serious case of receptive dysphasia. My daughter, who is fourteen, had no problems. And she's blonde. Lastly, I totally loved the interplay between Bond and Mathis. Worth the price of admission alone. The poignancy and tenderness (yes, tenderness) woven into their interaction, especially at a certain critical point, was beautifully rendered. Craig's emotion-wracked delivery of the line: 'He wouldn't care,' is almost heart-rending. Finally, the ending was a real coup and this is a true spoiler: M: 'I need you back.' Bond: 'I never left.' Cue – gun barrel. Cue - Bond theme. The gun barrel, Craig's first classic one, is a terrific way to end the film. Think about those final lines and the inclusion of that iconic image/sequence. What does that say? For me, it absolutely pegs out a stall, lays down an agenda for the future, makes a statement that Bond is here to stay. He will return. Personally I can't wait. Better than CR? No, it's different. Tone, style, content – different. If I believed in such things, I would rate it 8/10. Perhaps more importantly I would conclude ultimately that if you are a Bond fan and a fan of thoughtful action cinema, my guess is you really can't go wrong and you'll appreciate it no end. I can't wait to see it again. That's the truth.",10,45,87,1 November 2008
Insidious," Less than half good
","The first half is great. If I were rating this on the first half alone it would score an 8 or 9. But then, well...Haunted house movies are overburdened with clichés these days and this one is no different. Yet, the way in which the atmosphere is generated from the outset is extremely skilled and considered. The camera angles, the build-up, the inspired use of music and sound, all combine to create a successfully creepy and nervy ambiance. The scene where the wife sees through the window a short figure in black dancing to 'Tiptoe Through The Tulips' gives the nape of the neck a good tingling for a moment. The triggers within the script are cued immaculately, timed just right for the right unnerving effect. It kicks off and sustains an unswervingly solid creativity for the first fifty-percent of it's running time.Everything is cleverly crafted until this critical midpoint, wherein a decision must be made about the reveal, the moment for exposition when the audience begins to take delivery of what is going on and why. The makers opt for the most campy, hokey, misguided direction to take and the whole construct catastrophically falls apart.The introduction of the two Ghostbusters rejects, paranormal comedy nerds, is utterly jarring. They have lots of homemade electronic spirit-detecting paraphernalia to talk about and a standard slacker animosity for each other. Then the little old psychic lady, a physically normalised version of the eccentric short-stop from Poltergeist, steps in and dons a gas mask for a séance. She rattles off lots of mind-stupefying mumbo-jumbo about the afterlife and out of body experiences that absolutely ravages the fabric of credibility that the film has established. Next we're off to the astral plane, the realm of the dead, and it's really very badly realised - a sort of emptier, darker version of the real world with grinning, painted mannequins and lots of Alice Cooper eye makeup. The downhill plunge all the way to the 'oh, like I didn't see that coming - yawn' shock ending is astonishingly abrupt and irreversible.What starts as a genuinely disturbing paranormal chiller suddenly and sharply devolves into a banal, low-rent version of The Cell or Dreamscape, and my interest almost completely evaporated. It's such a shame that the trajectory of the premise didn't continue and deliver the expected payload in the second half. Seldom have I seen a film go from near genius to total bilge so completely, utterly and irredeemably. It's a real shame.The lesson is, when it's time to reveal what's been going on, these filmmakers should really try a lot harder in future to make what comes next as good as, if not better than, what has gone before. The foundation was there, but the roof caved in and wrecked it.",4,5,11,2 May 2011
I Am Legend," I Am Lacking
","Let's get my history out of the way first. I'm a big fan of the groundbreaking book. It represents the first and perhaps the most defining modern horror/fantasy novella ever to re-position the genre in genuine and contemporary circumstances which are recognisable and relatable to most of us. No Gothic castles or dense European locales replete with dark-haired men in capes slavering over bodice bursting virgins. Horror fiction came home. It roosted it's lethal vampiric form in the suburban and the urban. And a new genre was born. Stephen King is merely one writer who accredits IAL as being his major literary influence. It reinvented the genre. It deserves respect. More so than the movies has ever given it.There has been no satisfactory cinematic version to date, and Will Smith's update is no exception. 'The Last Man On Earth' was cheap, poorly edited, badly shot and gratuitously schlocky. 'The Omega Man' turned its' premise into a hippie-based pseudo-religious fable and the undead into a mutated cabal of cult followers in monk-like garb. Way out sheet, man! Then along comes Will. And a $150, 000, 000 budget. So, what do we get for entertainment in this day an age and at this particular price? I'd like to pick out the plus points. The depiction of a ruined, desolate city, ravaged by plague is superbly rendered. The production values are well represented up there on the screen and it shows where they spent a lot of the dough. Will acquits himself fairly well, especially in the scene where he kills his only companion  the infected German Sheppard. He tries really hard to give a value-for-money emotive performance and comes close to pulling it off on a few occasions. The art direction is spot on and the whole production glows with that big-budget epic sheen. The ending  and Neville's fate  was, I think, a brave move for such a big-budget production, and I applaud the producers for taking the route they did.The downsides: The film comes off as flat as a pancake and almost pleasantly banal. I have long since accepted that Hollywood is incapable of filming a straight adaptation of Matheson's scary and atmospheric novel, so I wasn't expecting that. I was, however, expecting some visceral thrills, chills, spills and jolts along the lines of the '28 Days/Weeks Later' movies at the very least. There's a lack of real blood and guts and the CGI rendered infected mutants are quite tame and poorly rendered overall. They were not frightening and imposing in the way that the infected in the '28 Days/Weeks Later' films were. I suppose because in IAL they looked like what they were for the most part  computer generated animations. They did not present as remotely real or realistic. Impossible, therefore, to take seriously. I'm going to assume the shock/horror/gore was deliberately toned way down to avoid getting an 'R' rating Stateside and thus perhaps limiting the films box-office appeal. In the process, the movie had its claws trimmed and impact diluted.IAL generates little atmosphere. Heston's 'The Omega Man' sees the protagonist cruising deserted streets littered with decaying corpses, shooting at anything that moves with his machine gun, a paranoid loner close to the edge. It strikes a primal chord. IAL gives us a flashy superstar racing at high speed through too-clean looking, corpse free cityscapes, hunting deer with his rifle and his dog, chilling out to Bob Marley. It's not apocalyptically unsettling or unnerving. Will seems to be having a little too much fun, whereas Chuck was understandably becoming increasingly mad, bad and dangerous to know.The script is littered with some truly clunking dialogue and Will does his best with it. Ultimately, though, he is sorely miscast and too darn friendly, cosy and nice generally to project the edgy, paranoid, grief-stricken obsessive personality of Neville in anything approximating a believable frame of reference. It's not that he's out of his depth, just in the wrong picture for his particular talents.I'm not going to dwell on the inconsistencies in the script or how, for a supposedly intelligent guy, Neville fails to see the infected as socially evolving  there is a 'leader' who shows open defiance by venturing into sunlight, luring him into a trap and sets infected dogs on him (clear evidence of an ordered thought process). Instead, he sees them as devolving to a more sub-human state. For a scientist, that's not very bright.Bottom line, yes, I was moderately entertained for the duration, the film held my attention despite very little adherence to or respect for the source material. Although miscast, Smith approaches his role with commendable enthusiasm but is badly let down by the shoddy script and the awesomely detached performances of Alice Braga and Charlie Tahan. It would have been a nice touch if Anna and Ethan had turned out to be further evolutionary mutations of the infection out to capture Neville and not be just arbitrarily immune  tipping a nod to the book at least  but it was not to be.Although it's a futile hope, one day someone somewhere may see the validity in realising in cinematic terms 'I Am Legend' as a faithful representation of the book in terms of its' content and themes. Until then, I'm afraid the current version will have to do, lacking as it is.",4,5,7,1 June 2008
Paranormal Activity," A truly cunning stunt...
","...or, to be more accurate, how a very cheap and silly film was repackaged and pumped-up to fool an audience and make an absolute fortune.'Paranormal Activity' is truly about as scary and believable as an episode of 'Scooby Doo.' Nothing more than a brutally cynical, major-league exercise in hype, marketing and ultimately a result of mass-audience gullibility for such things. Along with the plebian tendency to concur about the Emperor's New Clothes being everything they were led to believe.Whatever people see in this 'film' of any emotional or creative worth, I'm afraid I don't, and I'm going to stand up, point and shout: 'But the Emperor hasn't got any clothes on!' Let's face it - old hat, badly done. Liked the string pulling the door closed though. Was that included as an in-joke do you think? A little ironic jab in the ribs?To borrow a rhetorical slice of quippery from one John Lydon (a.k.a. Johnny Rotten): 'Ever been had? You 'ave now!'",Null,6,11,24 November 2009
Sinister," Deliver us from dumbness
","Critics praised and the public turned-out so see it in decent numbers. I found it dull, toothless and disappointing. I could stop there. However, IMDb requires more word-burning, so...True crime book writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is on the skids, desperate to come up with another hit bestseller. To this end, he moves his wife, son and daughter to a house in the sticks where the previous occupants were found hanged from a tree out back and the youngest daughter remains missing. He omits to inform his wife and kids of this information, because it's the sort of stuff that might influence a decision to buy or live in a particular property, and sets out on his merry investigative way.Hawke finds a collection of old 8mm films in the loft. They depict a series of murders of several families. Hawke reasons that someone must have filmed these events (smart guy) but who could it have been? The killer, perhaps? This is the point where it all falls apart and reason and logic evaporate into the ether never to be seen or heard from again.Right, yes, I know that horror/fantasy flicks arbitrarily require that logical behaviour need not fully apply and characters are fully within their rights to behave in ways that in the real world would give others some reasonable pause for thought. It's a given. This has to remain, though, to some acceptable degree, within logically explainable parameters in order to suspend disbelief and not alienate the audience and consequently erode their patience and goodwill.Now, I can accept the supernatural rationale for events, because in SINISTER's particular cinematic world it is the chosen raison d'être of the movie. And that's fine. But anyone who finds a box full of snuff films on their property and watches them and after doing so decides that it would be a really great idea not to turn them over to the police has just drop-kicked the living daylights out of all conception of what constitutes reasonable behaviour – even for a character in a horror flick.OK, it can be argued Hawke's character is under pressure, he's desperate to write a hit true crime expose, but come on! He's unearthed new evidence the police don't have. Handing it over makes him a part of the case, puts him square in the picture, part of the focus rather than an outsider and does not jeopardise in any way his chances of completing the book he wants to write. Rather, it increases them by getting the rather hostile fuzz onside. So concealing this new found evidence is intended to achieve what, exactly? Answers on a postcard.My sympathy for the character dissolved and with it much of my interest in the way things would then play out. An evil pagan entity is influencing kids to snuff their families and then join him in some spiritual parallel-dimension netherworld once the deed is done. This provides lots of scenes of ghostly looking zombie kids popping up at random moments and putting their fingers to their lips and going 'Shhhhh!' in an attempt to elicit some jump-scares, but really that's all it amounts to. Predictably, as is the way with most modern horror movies these days, everyone is doomed, evil triumphs, that's how it concludes.It's a shame, because the lead-in up to the point where Hawke makes his decision about the films is cleverly constructed and quite creepy and unnerving. There is a sense of genuine style, flair and atmosphere-building bubbling away. Then it vaporises. Recently, INSIDIOUS suffered from much the same problem – an excellent build-up blown to bits by a crass second half of irrationality and a humdrum cookie-cutter denouement. It would be nice if more often than not these movies were fashioned to deliver on their earlier promise. Dare to be different.",5,1,2,25 November 2012
Where Eagles Dare," The ultimate Nazi turkey shoot - what's not to like?
","Along with Aldrich's superlative 'The Dirty Dozen' this is the ultimate boy's own wish-fulfilment Second World War Nazi turkey shoot. And one of coolest war movies of all time. I make no bones here  I love it. Alistair MacLean's convoluted and twisty original script (he turned it into a novel at pretty much the same time) is designed to shift like an over-fuelled V2 rocket on nitroglicerine steroids. The plot is a vaguely labyrinthine vehicle for the pyrotechnics and mayhem; it drives the action without begging too much thought. A group of crack Brit paratroops (and one American) are dropped into snow-swept Bavaria to rescue an American General who is being held captive by Fritz in the impenetrable Schlos Adler  reachable only by cable car and helicopter. General Carnaby is, however, a fake  an American actor impersonating the real article. From then on in it gets increasingly more complicated, but, what the hell, who really cares? The two male leads, sixties movie icons in their own distinct ways, are unlikely bedfellows to say the least - Shakespearean Welsh actor Richard Burton and sardonic, minimalist American anti-hero Clint Eastwood. Yet, the way in which their polar opposite acting styles compliment each other is a rare surprise. Both stars seem to be having a ball, and neither overshadows the other. It makes for intriguing if not compelling viewing. This film has an almost Biblical disregard for human life and revels in arbitrary death and destruction. The sardonic and self-satisfied laughter of Burton as he and Eastwood blow up half a Bavarian village as a distraction and flee on a motorcycle and sidecar gives a clear hint at the gratuitous lack of conscience. Indeed, Nazis are shot, strangled, stabbed, blown-up, incinerated, hurled through car windscreens, kicked off cable cars, thrown down mountainous drops, etc, with a frivolous sense of cruel glee. Eastwood's special-forces assassin is as blackly humorous as he is cold and lethal. His stock greeting of 'Hello' just before he shoots someone point blank or machine-guns a stairwell full of Germans somehow (strangely) helps make him a likable character. He kills more people in this film than he has in any other to date. The dialogue is littered with sharp witticisms and memorable catchphrases: (After Shaffer/Eastwood has just killed a German with a knife) Smith: 'That was quick.' Shaffer: 'Fear lent him wings, as the saying goes.' Smith: 'Broadsword calling Danny Boy.' Mary: 'You're too old for this.' Smith: 'Thank you for those few kind words.' In the end, though, the aim of the film is to cram as much non-stop action into it's running time as it can and waste as many sons of the Fatherland as possible in the process. Technically, it is a product of it's time. The back-projection on the cable car scenes is shockingly poor by today's standards, and in many other respects it shows it's age. Also, Eastwood's resolutely sixties hairstyle and cynically hip demeanour places him incongruously in a whole different time frame. Yet it continues to remain a ripping yarn and a terrific thrill ride with a cracking cast. I've watched it dozens of times over the years and something always seems to draw me back to it. I've seen what are considered to be more 'worthy' and meaningful war movies a mere once or twice and probably never will again. That's entertainment for you.",9,1,2,3 June 2008
Taken 2," Taken 2 Far?
","Essentially a rehash of the first movie that seems to lack that films' pervasive sense of malevolence, danger, urgency and visceral gut-punch. This sequel is more of a by-the-numbers action workout that is a bit less coherent and engaging.That said, I don't think it quite deserved the stomping it got from the critics. It's well choreographed, the chases are quite exhilarating, and the shaky-cam is not really all that intrusive or troublesome. Cinematography is crisp and clear. Script and dialogue are as baseline functional and brain-dead as one would expect and there are no artistic pretensions whatsoever about the project. Although the violence is somewhat less explicit this time, it remains pleasingly jarring and bone-crunching, so the lack of a prohibitive adult rating is not missed overmuch.Liam Neeson remains a class act throughout and as an exercise in watching a superb performer in action man mode capping lots of sleazy foreign types it does the business with some skill. Let's face it, the xenophobe in all of us is catered for admirably and the motif of a lone hero blowing loads of swarthy scumbags to kingdom come is an action movie staple that has some lasting appeal. So there's that main attraction.If you liked the first, chances are you'll get some mileage out of this even though the basic premise seems to be running out of road. I do think a third entry in the series might be pushing it.",7,1,2,22 December 2012
Casino Royale," Their word was their Bond.
","The producers promised us something new, and their word was their Bond.Once I acclimatised myself to the level and tone it's pitched at I absolutely, thoroughly enjoyed it. Best Bond film since Lcence To Kill - and it is a 'Bond film,' despite some flailing critics deliberately manufacturing garbage diatribes to the contrary because they are at a loss to develop a truly functional critique.It has the character of James Bond in it played by an actor with a rare understanding of what that character is all about. This is not a Bond for Brosnan or Moore only fans, but holds appeal for those whose preferences included Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. Those used to and entrenched in hopeless love with the schoolboy targeted pseudo-Bond of the Brosnan tenure will not understand nor possess the capacity to accept or enjoy this movie.It is produced well, directed with dynamic flair and instinctive Bondian comprehension and conceptualisation (which surprised me, I admit) by the much evolved and improved Martin Campbell, and underpinned by a thoughtful and literate screenplay. It's a classic Bond updated to the modern world. I had reservations, but it's more or less what I wanted to see. There are flaws, it's not perfect, but I think it's a brave and positive forward step.Much spleen has been vented upon issues of Daniel Craig's casting, continuity and anything that constituted change from the well-worn formula. Twenty minutes into the film, all these concerns and considerations evaporate with the realisation - for anyone who has ever read the books - that Craig's portrayal is the closest to Flemings concept of the Bond character than anyone else's (including Connery and Dalton). It is so refreshing and exciting it gives that 'Yes!' feeling when you realise that Craig has nailed it.On the downside, it's overlong and would have benefited from trimming by 15-20 mins for cinema release. The expected director's cut DVD will be even longer - not a problem for me personally - but some with limited attention spans may feel their interest waver slightly. Plus, the character of Le Chiffre isn't given enough to do and never fully makes his presence felt until the expertly handled torture scene - by which time...well, you have to see the film.Personally, it's one of the best Bonds and I think it's going to grow in stature (much like OHMSS) as time moves on. I eagerly await the next instalment. After years of treading water, Bond is back where he belongs.",10,12,20,20 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Nostalgic Emotions...
","I've read a lot of reviews of the latest SW thing, and in many of them the authors cite feeling as if they had been transported back in time to when they first experienced the first SW movie when they were younger. It evoked nostalgic emotions.Over the festive period the opportunity arose for me to see Forced Wakeup, and so I went. And I saw. And I have to admit it I experienced the same nostalgic emotions the original film left me with after queueing in the rain to see A New Dope when it was first released unto the world. Yep, I'm that old.I was impressed with the music then, and I remain impressed now. I was impressed with the visuals then (they were groundbreaking, technologically stunning for their time) and I was impressed now. The CGI is some of the best I have ever seen - dazzling stuff, brilliantly executed. The sound design remains a winner both then and now. And finally, on both counts, I experienced that familiar 'what is everybody else seemingly seeing or getting or engaging with that I'm not?' sensation. It echoed down the decades with the force (see what I did there?) of a deja-vu moment on steroids and was as such undiminished.OK, I wasn't bored, never felt the need to get up and leave, was wowed by the technology throughout, but the plot, the dialogue, the characters, the tweeness, the hollowness, the irrational stupidity of the whole thing marked the film as a B movie 50s potboiler dressed up in superb hi-tech clobber. I mean a key character buys the farm and the emotional response of the film is the equivalent of 'Oh dear. Shame that. Anyway, roll on some more CGI and whizz-bang and let's get some more pyrotechnical eye-candy up in you!' The character who dies is, to all intents and purposes, the human heart and soul of the whole original trilogy. No special powers, you see. But it's not really worth the time of day when the ultimate aim is more 'DUMB-DUMB...DUMB-DUMB-DA-DUMB-DUMB!'I never did understand the adulation expressed by people of all ages across the globe for SW. I didn't get it then, I don't get it now. And I love sci-fi flicks. But the SW phenomenon continues to leave me cold and mildly bewildered. Maybe it's my loss and I'm very likely in a minority - but hey, so be it. I certainly don't begrudge anyone their love if it, because in my experience we don't necessarily choose who or what to love. Authentically, anyhow.",4,14,19,10 January 2016
The Purge," Purged of any suspension of disbelief
","OK, yes, I know cinema - especially the horror/thriller genre - assumes some reasonable suspension of disbelief as a given. But THE PURGE is a film that makes it so hard for the audience to achieve, it ultimately falls flat on it's face due to the complete illogicality and irrationality of the narrative and the mind-blowingly stupid actions of the characters. In a comedy/spoof you'd just about get away with it. But my guess is, THE PURGE is not intended as a rib-tickler.The concept of targeted, channelled violence into recreational pursuits as a means of imposing political control through catharsis is a sci-fi mainstay and is nothing new (DEATH RACE 2000, ROLLERBALL, THE RUNNING MAN, etc). That it's a generally ludicrous conceit (go to a UK football match for proof) doesn't matter providing the fictional construct depicting it has some internal logic going for it that enables effective suspension of disbelief. You gotta be able to buy into it.Here, we are expected to believe that citizens can vent all the anger and violent urges they have suppressed for the rest of the year and let it explode over a twelve hour period. Then, when the time is up, go back to being a law-abiding citizen for another whole year. They can kill, mutilate, slaughter with no psychological ill-effects and carry on as normal. This, we are told, has reduced crime in the US to almost zero and has cut down on poverty and homelessness because it's the poor and homeless who are the main targets for victimisation.In the UK the current Coalition Government are trying much the same thing with increased taxation and benefit cuts instead of outright mass homicide. It's sort of backfired, though, and is in fact increasing poverty and homelessness. Maybe they'll see this film and consider the approach for their next election manifesto.Anyway, the premise is absurd, but I can live with it. What I can't live with is:1. Hotshot home security genius heading for the top spot at work who has a feeble and next to useless security system installed in his own home.2. 'Intelligent' techno-wizard son who overrides the security system on Purge Night to allow sanctuary to a bleeding black guy he doesn't know. The streets are awash with homicidal stalkers toting some serious weaponry. He knows this. He also knows the security code - who the hell gave it to him and why? Put yourself in this kid's position. Wouldn't you at least mention your plan to your parents first, considering everyone's life is on the line? What, no discussion? Just do it? Smart kid. Really. You just got everyone killed. 3, Teenie daughter who, once an unknown person with an unknown agenda is loose in the house on the most horrific and deadly night of the year, wanders off on her own like some petulant Tinkerbell. OK, arguably she was traumatised by the death of her boyfriend who had just tried to execute her father. But come on, she knows the score. What is she, three? 4. You're a home security hotshot and you don't have a panic room or a feasible defensible position in your home. 5. Once the house is invaded by a bunch of sociopathic killers with guns, axes, knives and cudgels, everyone splits up and wanders around in the dark, rather than staying together in the most secure, defensible area of the house and letting the nutbars come to them and then letting rip with their collective firepower. In the film ZULU there's a reason why the troops at Rorke's Drift didn't randomly wander off separately into the veldt looking for the ZULU warriors. Any ideas? 6. No one looks behind them to see if there is anyone there. Why?7. Why spend ages duct taping the black guy to a chair rather than just immediately throwing his incapacitated ass out through the door as per the attacker's demands?I could go on and on, but that's enough or I'll be here for a week.On the plus side - although the dialogue is largely tripe - the performances by the actors are generally solid, even if their characters are terminally clichéd: model wife, exec husband, hormonal teen daughter, nerdy son, histrionic pantomime villains, token black victim (who just happens to be a homeless, poverty stricken loser and societal pariah). Decent production values for what it is, some well orchestrated fight scenes with accompanying bloodshed and a pleasingly downbeat if slightly preachy and moralising ending.Although purged of any capacity to engender suspension of disbelief, in fairness it's never boring or tedious, just illogical and frustrating. The germ of a good movie is in place and maybe the proposed sequel will put it to more satisfying use. But then, we know what most sequels are like. Right?",5,1,3,29 June 2013
Looper," Circle of One
","Time travel conundrum action flick from writer/director Rian Johnson whose debut feature, BRICK, is one of the most super-hip, ultra-quirky and subversive modern noir detective flicks ever made. If Raymond Chandler had been a high school slacker in waiting in the 21st century, BRICK is something he would have written. Needless to say, I like it and rate it highly, and was the primary motivation in my wanting to watch this offering.LOOPER is a bigger budgeted sci-fi thriller with some celebrity muscle in the cast (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels) and some studio monetary polish shining the surface. The hook is that in the near future criminals from the more distant future are sent back in time to be executed by hit men called Loopers, thus all evidence of the killings are erased from that distant future time. Loopers are well paid for this service, but there comes a day of reckoning when the act of 'closing the loop' may be visited upon them, involving their own future selves being sent back for the chop. Joe (Gordon-Levitt) is a Looper whose future self (Willis) is sent back but doesn't want to play ball and goes on the run. This leaves Joe with the prickly problem of having to find and kill his future self whilst evading capture by his fellow criminals. The narrative is further complicated when Joe meets young mother Sara (Blunt) and her son Cid on their isolated farm. Cid it seems has a big part to play in Joe's future destiny, but what, exactly? LOOPER is fast-paced, thoughtful and well-executed. The paradoxes and complexities of time-travel theory are neatly glossed over and generally airbrushed out so they don't give the audience a distracting and perplexing headache. The way in which Gordon-Levitt and Willis play the same character at different ages is masterfully handled through shared physical similarities, vocal inflexions and mannerisms and some pretty nifty acting and interplay from the two leads. This adds a great deal of credibility to the proceedings, helping to suspend disbelief significantly.Ultimately, it is slick hokum, yet has a degree of heart and soul with a nice twist of sacrifice and redemption thrown in. Johnson is sure-footed in most of his moves here and at least delivers something a decent cut above the low-brow common-denominator. Oh, and Jeff Daniels scene steals like the clued-in pro he is â€“ always worth a look.",Null,0,2,25 November 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," You're in for a big surprise
","Joss Whedon co-scripted this atypical horror flick and his creative fingerprints are all over the film. It's what SCREAM could have achieved, but fell short of. Where SCREAM aspired to deconstructing the mythology of the slasher flick and reconstructing it as a self-aware parody, CABIN sparks the target in a much more holistic and satisfying way - subverting the entire modern horror movie genre in order to achieve it's ends. Clever, smart, it absolutely takes the stereotypical set-up and characters for thousands of by-the-numbers slasher/horror flicks and turns them upside down and inside out. It's funny, subversive, unpredictable. An intriguing, perplexing roller-coaster ride with vats of gore and a cracking conclusion. And Sigourney Weaver.What's not to like.",Null,0,4,2 September 2012
Spectre," Tempus Fugit
","First things first. Saw it last night. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Today, I want to see it again. So, for me, it really is that good. Effectively, it's a bit of a table-turner on the detractors/haters of the Craig-era Bond movies. The ones who felt that EoN, in the process of deconstructing Bond and the Bond movies, had thrown the baby out with the bathwater. What they have now done is put both the baby and the bathwater back – albeit in an updated/modernised way.There may be spoilers from here on in, so if you don't want to know, stop reading now.Gunbarrel back at the start – and it's the old fade-to-black type rather than the zoom-out version. M – complete with bureaucratically austere office – is male and running the double-0 section. Moneypenny and Q are in place – and Q ventures into the field with Bond as Desmond did on occasion. Tanner's back, always good to see him, and Felix gets a mention. There are gadgets – exploding watch, tricked-out Aston with flamethrower, ejector seat (this time with parachute), etc. A globe-trotting plot that is hilariously silly, twisty and convoluted (par for most Bond movies). One-liners, some rude, some just smart. Ludicrous and inexplicably achieved changes of clothing for Bond and Swann. White tux – always a nice touch. We get a very badass and mute (apart from one line) henchman who is infinitely more physically powerful than Bond (Oddjob/Jaws). Nehru wearing villain complete with lair (not a hollowed-out volcano, granted, but a meteor crater in the desert housing a high-tech and very explosive installation). Villain gets a very familiar facial scar (think Donald Pleasance). White cat also. Vehicles that turn up without any prior introduction (Bond arrives flying a plane at one point, where the hell did he get that? Never mind, doesn't matter, just enjoy the spectacle as it gets progressively trashed in the Alps). There are multiple action set pieces beautifully shot and choreographed, but the opening pre-credits sequence is one of the best ever. That long tracking shot is creative gold, and the faint echoes of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY in the helicopter climax brought a smile to my face early on.I could continue for quite some time yet, but I think that's enough to illustrate the point that the stall SPECTRE lays out is fundamentally old school. General audiences and fans that accept it for what it is and go along for the ride will reap the rewards in terms of entertainment value. Those who want the more introspective vibe of SKYFALL, the muscular punch and nouveau tough edge of CASINO ROYALE or the rapid fire jump-cutting mayhem of QUANTUM OF SOLACE will not find that stuff here. There are personal elements for Bond, but they hardly have any effect on him and are shrugged off in favour of getting on with the mission. Craig plays him as a confident, ruthless, faintly sociopathic rogue with a cool steely line in sardonic humour and a penchant for shallow romance. And something of a heart and soul, of course. The past may influence the future, but the future is where this Bond is headed and what's behind him pales into insignificance in comparison with what's to come. And that's a good thing in SPECTRE.Those 'fans' and others who made up their minds in advance not to like the film probably won't. Those who slavishly indulged and bought into all the publicity and hype surrounding it may very well be disappointed, as like most movies it doesn't fully live up to it. All that jazz needs to be put aside – everyone knows it's just smoke and mirrors...don't they? Those who feel they can appreciate an old school Bond movie in a modern context or just want two and a half hours of slickly made escapist entertainment featuring one of the greatest action heroes of modern film and literature, will very likely have a blast. For me, it felt too short rather than too long. Tempus fugit. Especially when you're having fun.As for the negatives - can't really rave over the score or the theme song as I found them pretty underwhelming – SPECTRE cries out for something a bit more rousing, but unfortunately it doesn't get it. Craig could easily throw in the towel at this point, as SPECTRE brings his tenure full circle if we look at it as a story arc. The ending – a bit unsatisfying from my perspective - leaves things open-ended. I would have preferred something a bit more conclusive. But there you go. The world is not enough and you can't have everything – and ain't that the truth?",9,11,31,1 November 2015
