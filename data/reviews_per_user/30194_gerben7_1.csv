The Avengers," So many mistakes....
","So many mistakes in one movie.The biggest ones: In the middle of the alien attack, Hulk rushed through a top floor of a building and people there are still working!!! Is it normal to keep on working in a high building if the city is under siege of a bunch of aliens?When there is a far view of the beam on the city, you see ships still not moving away from it.They are not fleeing the scene. The aliens that attack the earth, have not even powerful weaponry, only small firearms,or ships with a very small blast radius. There are no huge blows.If I was to invade earth I would bring serious firepower.The army of Thanos, has not. I did not see the US air force, anywhere!!You would say that they would scramble all jets to fight the aliens.The army and navy (with cruise missiles to knock of any target that comes out of the beam) are not in sight either.Where are all other superheroes when earth is under siege?It makes no sense to make a event with this impact (the earth is at stake) if you are not able to get all heroes in one movie.I know there are different franchises, so I would suggest that something else would be at stake, the live of a superheroes or a small republic.Now this has become a movie with huge gaps, all heroes survive miraculously and Coulson relives in a series after he died.It is poor.",Null,2,7,5 October 2014
