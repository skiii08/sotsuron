Blade Runner 2049," The curse of the sequels.
","The curse of the sequels appears to be one of the few iron rules of cinema after the only iron rule of cinema inscribed on the tablets by screen writer William Goldmann that 'nobody knows anything'.It only seems to have been broken, as critics and audience generally agree, in Godfather II.To my mind, it wasn't broken in Blade Runner II (2049).Hollywood seems to have this predilection for inviting, in preference to British and American directors, French directors to direct big projects, such as Fifth Dimension by Luc Bresson, and frankly 'je ne sais quoi pourquoi.' (I don't know why.)French directors tends in Hollywood at least, to be portentous, overlong and doomladen and Blade Runner II by Denis Villeneuve is for me a case in point.The original Blade Runner of 1981 is by general acclaim one of the great sci-fi films of all time where Ridley Scott got everything absolutely right.I have seen both two alternative endings (original and Director's Cut), in the original where both were open-ended but one was a little more optimistic. I think both of those endings worked.Denis Villeneueve, and the writers, of the sequel decided to give us, in my opinion, a downbeat one. I have used up two and three quarter hours of my life to watch an ending only a little less pessimistic than Shakepeare's King Lear. But, well, I had to watch the sequel since I so loved the original. I will watch the original again and again. I very much doubt I will spend another two and three hours watching the sequel.I have also to critique Ryan Gosling's performance as the successor to main character Deckard not because it was badly acted or uncommitted, it wasn't, it was a decent performance, but he had, probably inevitably, so much less charisma than Harrison Ford in his prime.The visuals were gorgeous but then they would have been so under any director, given the advance in special effects (sfx) since the original in 1981 - whose sfx still hold up pretty well.To be fair to this film, however, it was worth me watching to gauge the sequel and spend the time in writing this review. There are very few Hollywood films these days about which I might say that. It was an honest attempt at intelligent sci-fi. How films of that sort are made these days?",3,9,15,4 August 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Profoundly disappointed, a missed opportunity
","Very, very, very few sequels are as good as the originals. The scriptwriter William Goldmann may have written that in Hollywood 'nobody knows anything' but there is at least this one iron law, from which everyone should learn.Frin'stance, where sci-fi films are concerned, the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey was 2010 and it was a feeble sequel to the original, even though it featured the original script-writer Arthur C. Clarke. Its director Peter Hyams simply wasn't up to the job. The genius of the original was due to the collaboration of Clarke and director Stanley Kubrick.Neither has director Denis Villeneuve proved, in my view, up to the challenge of Blade Runner: 2049. And yet once again, one of the original screenwriters collaborated on this film, too; Hampton Fancher.I fear that great films may simply be unrepeatable in their greatness. The Godfather Part II was the exception which proves the rule.Ridley Scott, director of the original, cannot by himself guarantee a great film. He needs great collaborators to match his genius for visualisation but in the original he had them.In the words of British director Michael Powell, with a film all you can do is built a nest and hope a magic bird makes a nest in it. This is what the original Blade Runner did. This is what the sequel simply does not do.K... to specifics. There is at the end of the original film an open ending, an ending of hope, through all the rainy, futuristic darkness which was gone before. This sequel is just shot through with Gallic pessimism, without even any redeeming Gallic wit. If you like Gallic pessimism in your films, so be it. But I don't see why 2049 had to be a Gallic film. I personally wanted it to be a Hollywood one. And it was so plodding. Ridley Scott said the sequel was too long by an hour but it wouldn't have been plodding had it been engaging. Gallic films are not known for their warmth and human engagement. (K... Denis Villeneuve may be French Canadian but that counts as French in my view.)The visuals are gorgeous but Denis Villeneuve wasn't responsible for those. With modern special effect, they would have been glorious whoever had directed it.Also, none of the major actors in this film had the charisma of the originals, Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean Young. Yes, Harrison Ford does make a guest appearance in the sequel but that is all it is.Ryan Gosling is a decent enough actor but he is inferior to Harrison Ford's brooding, dignified and manly presence in the original. Harrison Ford, who was in his prime, carried the original in the same way that Hamlet carries, well, Hamlet. Ryan Gosling cannot carry the sequel. None of the female leads equal the glorious beauty and tragic femininity of Sean Young. There is no successor in the sequel to Rutger Hauer, God rest his soul, but then how could there be?Jared Leto makes a serviceable corporate villain as Niander Wallace but is still outclassed by Joe Turkell as the cerebral and amoral but not so brutal Eldon Tyrell of the original.I am not saying that Denis Villeneuve is a bad director but just that he wasn't right for this film. (And I liked a lot Peter Hyam's Capricorn One). Nor that Ryan Gosling is not a good actor but he was not right for this film.I go back to the words of Michael Powell. 'All one can hope for is to build and nest a hope that a magic bird will fly to it and makes it nest.' The original Blade Runner is a nest which a magical bird made its own. In my opinion, this cannot be said for 2049.However, Ridley Scott speaks of the possibility of a tre-quel. I would still like to see that!",3,2,5,11 August 2019
As Good as It Gets," Emotional intelligence
","What this film has and which no Marvel comic blockbuster has is 'emotional intelligence'. In this case, basically, the film is emotionally literate. It is dealing with the raw emotions of real people.Speaking as a guy, I don't like that Jack Nicholson's character Melvin, for all his flaws, ends up so much in debit to Helen Hunt's character Carol and her hard edges. Guys aren't always in the wrong and it is usually the case that the gals like to put us permanently on the defensive. I don't like that in real life and I don't like that in film. Helen Hunt's character Carol has an ailing son for whom to care and she is a fierce mother, there is nothing wrong with that, but Helen Hunt's Carol is the kind of woman from whom perhaps someone like Melvin should actually have stayed away. She has some very hard edges to her, for whatever reason, that could cut a guy every which way, although, to be fair to her, you sense that in her fierceness she can show a fierce loyalty, too. Speaking as a guy, however, I am not sure it is a happy ending for OCD but otherwise sensitive Melvin to end up with her. But I say again that what I like about the film is its emotional intelligence. It is about the ordinary human emotions, the emotions which make us human, or lacking which make us not so human. So many films today are emotionally illiterate for young males in America, Europe or Asia or wherever, who are emotionally illiterate but want something sexy in the picture and in which people get killed and things get blown up every ten minutes or so. For the Hollywood accountants, this is what puts bottoms on seats, brings in the dough.I am not sure that 'As good as it gets' could be made today for where is he Jack Nicholson or the Helen Hunt with the subtlety to make it.The film has one of my all-time favourite scenes. Melvin has been to see his psychiatrist but he is still not happy afterwards, about his life or life in general. So he appeals to the people in the waiting room: 'Is this as good as it gets?' Is this not the question that any intelligent person must have asked themselves at some point? Repeatedly.",9,1,1,12 March 2017
12 Angry Men," Legal philosophiser to appeal to any intelligent person
","There are, that I know of, two legal systems, the Anglo-Saxon adversarial system and the French system. The French system has judge and jury as paid legal officials. The idea behind that is that trained and experienced legal officials at all stages of the process can deliver a better verdict. But the weakness is that such a system is more open to political corruption. In the English system there is judge, jury - made up of ordinary people who are drafted - and barristers. With some tweaks, the American system follows the British system.Which is the better? An un-answerable question but a fascinating one. I have always thought there is a moral ambiguity at the heart of this film. The number of genuinely decent, intelligent, educated and well-meaning jurors seems to be outweighed by the number of bigoted, prejudiced, mentally lazy and ill-educated ones. In the latter category, what psychologists today call those affected by 'motivated reasoning', made founding US father Alexander Hamilton distrustful of pure democracy and hence his electoral college to elect the President. So this film is a powerful disquisition on both the Anglo-Saxon jury system and democracy. Actually, any legal system is intimately a reflection of the political system. The moral core of the film is Henry Fonda, of course, whom Republicans today would call a 'bleeding-heart liberal'; certainly some of the characters in the film called him that more or less literally so that conservative pejorative labelling is not new. His willingness to give the young defendant, accused of killing his father, in what some of the jurors lazily called an 'open and shut' case, what you Americans call a 'fair shake' is what drives the plot. Then other jurors, better intentioned, rally to his standard and others less enlightened subsequently rally to his standard, as most people do to a true leader, one of his persuasive qualities and of his quality of character, if only to follow the tide of loyalty.One of the jurors calls Henry Fonda's character an exponent of the soft-sell. But that plain-Joe juror doesn't understand the difference between selling marmalade, which is the latter's job, and intelligence allied to a genuine conscience, which are the hall-mark qualities of Henry Fonda's 'architect' persona.Solon, the ancient Greek lawgiver, was once asked what would it take for justice to come into this world. He replied that justice would only come into this world if enough people who did not suffer injustice would feel for those who did. We are not there yet. In any film, play or novel a successful one is one in which all the leading characters are well-rounded and you feel that if you met them on the street you would recognise them immediately. This the film amply fulfills. Apart from anything else, the film is a master-class in top American actors of the late fifties.I would certainly like a Henry Fonda character on my jury if I ever faced murder in the first degree. But the curious thing is, the curious thing is, that on reviewing the evidence as it is presented in the film and despite the attempt at rebuttal which is the agenda of this film, I think the evidence stacked more against the defendant than for him! But I repeat, I would surely pray for a Henry Fonda character on my jury. One of the characters in the Sidney Lumet's excellent 'The Verdict', (1982) a wise old black doctor, (I likee how it was so aptly described as a 'legal Rocky') consoles Paul Newman's lawyer with the sentence that juries can sometimes surprise one in the rightness of their verdict. I guess for all its faults the Anglo-Saxon version of justice is the better.",10,1,2,1 March 2017
The Natural," Baseball as King Arthur's quest
","Of course I love the scene at the end where Robert Redford's fated Roy Hobbs wins the all-important pennant game by smashing the baseball into the floodlights. It is one of the great scenes of American sporting cinema.But my favourite scene is previously when Glenn Close as his genuine love interest, as opposed to the evil character of a modern Morgan la Fay, so well-played by Kim Basinger, stands up in Wrigley Field magically willing him to break his poor batting run. Her character tranfuses strength into him, giving that scene an Arthurian, chivalric resonance. But then so has the whole film that glorious mythic quality. I am also thinking of Field of Dreams, here. What is it about baseball which so lends itself to films of mythic power?In this film some elements of its success can be readily identified: Barry Levinson's direction, the star power of the actors and, of critical importance, the power of Randy Newman's score. But then it also has a magic over all that, unanticipated by its makers.",10,4,6,15 December 2016
Interstellar," Appallingly badly written for a major serious sci-fi film
","The various merits or demerits of Christopher Nolan's style of film-making is beside the point.This was the worst plotted and written major sci-fi film I have ever paid good money to see. Having seen it a few months ago now, that response firmly stays with me. To be sure, it had sumptuous production values and committed performances but this film cannot be considered serious sci-fi for how poorly it was plotted and written. I read that it had been written with serious scientific input from experts on black holes but that didn't show to me.Now I like space opera and I also like sci-fi films with ideas, the bigger the better. Black holes are incredibly complicated phenomena for the eggheads to understand, let alone the average or even the serious film-goer. Black holes also speculatively throw up all sorts of illogical ideas about their nature, which cause headaches for the scientists but which can be fun to work through on the silver screen. I wanted to like this film. I don't need my sci-fi to make perfect sense. I love Kubrick's 2001. I like the mystery and awe engendered by contemplating the cosmos, whether philosophically or dramatically. I just felt as I watched this film how my intelligence was being increasingly insulted by logical non-sequiturs of plot and character - even allowing for a scenario involving black holes where all kinds of paradoxes could and should be thrown at the characters and played around with - which were in my judgement the result of plain bad or lazy writing. This script had it not been written by the Nolans would never in my opinion have been passed in a film school project, let alone made into a big-budget film. I have ticked the box about the spoilers alert but I am not sure I have any spoilers to spill. It was a few months ago that I saw the film and I can now barely remember the plot because it made no sense to me on any level at the time. Even if a plot isn't easy to understand and appears illogical, and once again I re-iterate that with the inherent nature of the subject we are talking about metaphysical paradoxes here big-time, it ought to have an inner logic, make an inner sense. This was just a script-writing mess as far I could judge it. Incidentally, watching his Batman film I thought there was some very lazy plotting in that too, so this wasn't a one off. Does no one in Hollywood care anymore about good writing? Are major films now all about 'never mind the quality feel the width'?",1,6,12,18 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Better than I expected.
","No spoilers! I promise.I have always watched the Star Wars franchise for the special effects rather than the plot and characterisation. I read in my younger days serious science fiction writers, such as Arthur C. Clark or Stanislaus Lem, and there has never been, in my view, any serious science fiction in Star Wars! Just cod mythology. But done with verve and excellent special effects.But, as I say, the special effects as were gorgeous as ever and I have given it quite a high rating because I found it unexpectedly moving. I won't say why, of course, but J.J. Abrams is a first class sci-fi director and it shows. He rejuvenated the Star Trek franchise and he has rejuvenated this. The references and recapitulations of previous Star War films was expertly and movingly done.There was almost a Shakespearian depth to some of the plotting.It is interesting that Mark Hamill said that George Lucas would work without actors if he could .Well, there was no clunckiness to the script of this film and I think it tidied everything up in a nice Tattooine bow as neatly as one could have hoped.May the force be with you.",7,5,17,8 January 2020
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," No spoilers here just a very general criticism about Hollywood actioners
","I give this film five out of ten for the excellent CGI for I am a sucker for CGI.I believe I can pinpoint the problem with the Hobbit as I can some (though not all) of the Steven Spielberg films and nearly all of the George Lucas films - and indeed most of the American actioners since 1914!If you look up the 'Peril of Pauline' (1914) in Wikipedia you will read an article on the genesis of all modern American actioners, no matter how sophisticated their production values are these days. The Perils of Pauline is one of the primeval actioners. There is no pacing in Perils of Pauline as it is all about how every ten minutes there is an almost insurmountable physical danger or problem for the heroine to solve but that 'in a leap he/she is free'. This appealed to the unsophisticated cinema audiences of the time, which is fair enough when cinema was in its infancy, and they knew that the stunts were real, but sadly still appeals to the unsophisticated cinema audiences of today, worldwide, though they demand, of course, better special effects. I am not great fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's work - I consider it mythological pastiche - but I intuit he would be horrified at the complete lack of dramatic nous modern cinema directors display in reproducing his work, whether they are American or not.This legacy, in my humble opinion, which most Hollywood directors have never outgrown, presumably because the films are still so profitable, has disfigured American cinema in this genre for the past century and there doesn't look to be any prospect of it changing in another century.",5,1,2,29 June 2015
Black Hawk Down," 'Only the dead have seen the end of war'
","'Only the dead have known the end of war.'This is the statement by the classical philosopher Plato with which the film commences. And it is well chosen for this is the theme of this magnificent and thought provoking film. I don't need to say any more on the excellent cinematography and pacing of Black Hawk Down, as so many of the threads have noted. It is a Ridley Scott film after all. His eye never fails him but he is always reliant on a good script and his failures have been films lacking them but here the script is for its subject spot on. I wish to make my own personal, political observation, which is what the film provokes in me, beyond, of course, its excellent entertainment value. In the jargon of geopolitics, Somalia was, and today tragically still is, a 'failed state'. Without preaching at you, Black Hawk Down gives you the visceral experience of what fighting in a failed state is like, from both the American and the Somali perspective. The film hints at the limits of American power with echoes of the previous American defeat in Vietnam but also at the idealism which brought American soldiers into the country in the first place, trying to bring peace, justice and food to the desperate, starving and cruelly exploited Somali populace. The fate of the West, and perhaps the fate of the world, now more than ever will depend upon a hundred more such missions as depicted in Black Hawk Down and whether we win them or not; indeed, whether we fight them or not. This is the ultimate test of humanity, to be borne by both civilians in the midst of a brutal civil war and the peacekeeper soldiers brought in from outside whose story is told in this film. This entertaining but also harrowing film provides the cue for the more thoughtful of us to reflect on the human condition. Given the perfect geopolitical storm, is any country on this earth, , entirely immune from the risk of becoming a 'failed state'? We should not arrogantly assume that any of our countries could never, ever descend to the level of Somalia, with brave but stressed soldiers struggling to hold the ring and civilians caught in the murderous crossfire. This is what Black Hawk Down means philosophically to me, a warning for the future for any country, however prosperous and peaceful it may presently be, and a warning for the future of humanity. With regard to the performances, I thought that Eric Bana was particularly good in the film as a reflective, quietly competent, decent and brave American soldier. I wish we had subsequently seen more of him.",10,2,3,28 August 2016
