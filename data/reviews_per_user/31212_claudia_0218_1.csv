The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Just wonderful
","I just saw it and I hardly wait to see the next one. I love the sound, the music and I was happy that finally the director realized that the first Twilight has a very good music and use it again. The wolfs scene, when they found out about Bella being pregnant, was terrifying and very well done, but there was more fights between wolfs and vampires who I enjoyed them. I appreciated that the book has been carefully observed. I recognized every line in this movie. And everything was sprinkled with beautiful landscapes, moon lights, beautiful houses, lovely scenery, lovely people. Before I go and see Breaking Dawn, I read a lot of bad reviews and, honestly, now, i don't understand it. My advice would be, for everybody, to go and watch, and judge each on by its own. I watched expecting the worse and I had a very very good surprise. Twilight fans, because this movie is especially for you, and people who are in love, you will appreciate this movie so much. Go watch it!",10,3,12,24 November 2011
