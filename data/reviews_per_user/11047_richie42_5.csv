The Blair Witch Project," YAWN
","Yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, is it over yet? Yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, Ha-ha! Yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, sorry - did I fall asleep? Oh, God! It's still going on and on and on and on and on and on and not doing anything different or interesting. Yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn. Oh great! It's finished. Now to do something interesting . . . . . . .",2,0,2,31 March 2003
Alien," H P Lovecraft goes to space in a monstrous gunmetal grey boat
","Seven explorers pick up a hitcher in deep space. The hitcher proceeds to bump them off one by one.A variation of a classic premise?Undoubtedly!Ever been done better?NO!With the genius triumvirate Ridley Scott, Dan O'Bannon and H R Giger driving this film with their unique visions so rock solid in design and concept, how could it be?Ridley Scott demonstrates his unique cinematic view to the utmost here, paralleled only by 'Blade Runner' and 'Gladiator'. Even the bright sets are relatively under-lit and diminish in frequency as the movie progresses; as it draws ever nearer its dark heart. You are always looking into the shadows to see if there is anything moving. And because of Scott's excellent pacing and character development - Ripley emerging as the strongest for one - you are always rooting for her, especially willing her to get the emergency cooling system to start up again. Shouting at her to get up that ladder quick before the boogeyman comes up behind her.We see Dan O'Bannon finally get to deliver the horrendous monster he first thought up for John Carpenter's 'Dark Star' (remember the beach ball that gets nasty in an elevator shaft? In an enclosed space?) And we also get to see his workable, lived-in view of the future.And Mr Giger? The man who can make horrible, horrendous things look eerily beautiful? There is no doubt that without his perfectly spine chilling creation(s) this film would not have worked; this film would not still stand today as one of the all time great science fiction/horror movies.#62 in the IMDb top 250? Behind 'Star Wars'? Behind '2001'? I think not!H P Lovecraft would have loved this story.10 out of 10 (even if it is just a guy in a suit!).",10,0,1,16 June 2002
Aliens," One of the best copies ever!
","When I first heard there was a sequel to 'Alien' been made I thought that classic line from Douglas Adams' 'Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy': 'Oh no! Not again!' For what sequel has ever surpassed its original in quality and style? Or remotely matched it, for that matter?Well, 'Aliens' did - with considerable style, aplomb and NERVE!What do I mean, 'nerve'?The ending of course!It's all over - just like the original was.Ripley killed the monster and got to safe haven - just like she did in the original.But the alien came along for the ride - just like it did in the original.Then there was another do or die fight - just like there was in the original.The monster was once more bested - just like in the original.And they all went to sleep with the camera zooming in on their faces - just like it did in the original.That's what I mean by nerve.And did James Cameron's near direct lifting of the original's ending spoil 'Aliens' in the least?Definitely not.For what Cameron managed to do was turn the slow suspenseful plot of 'Alien' into a hold-on-to-your-seat 5-gees roller-coaster ride. He managed to give us another side - another view - of the aliens and to help us to understand how tenacious the species is.As usual with Cameron films, the 'Special Edition' gives even more depth to the original theatre release. I have both versions. I only ever watch the Special Edition. I have just one reservation about the Special Edition: there is one too many Hudson scenes - the one where he's blabbing on about all the weapons they're carrying on the drop ship; in the APC. It just goes on too long (Paxton improvising?) and for me weakens his character.Never mind.10 out of 10.(A footnote to sequels: a certain J K Rowling has surpassed each and every Harry Potter novel with the next one. Let's hope the films manage to do the same!)",10,1,2,16 June 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," The best science fiction film ever made.
","Yes, it is! (Even James Cameron said so - don't ask me for the reference, I just saw him interviewed on the TV.)It may not be the most exciting SF film ever made, but it is definitely the closest thing ever filmed to future reality. This is because the reality level in this film is extremely high - just a few blunders (see the 'goofs' page http://us.imdb.com/Goofs?0062622 and look at the 'factual errors' entries). There are none of the ridiculous explosions, such as those in the 'Star Wars' series, or 'The Fifth Element', or the 'Star Trek' films (don't get me wrong - these films are high up on my favourite movies list), audible through vacuum. (But remember the 'Alien' tag-line: 'In Space no one can hear you scream'!) I know it sounds good and adds to the occasion and lets the subwoofers rip - BUT IT'S WRONG! Also, there's none of the exploding-eyes-in-a-vacuum rubbish such as in 'Total Recall' and 'Outland'. (Although Bowman's lungs should have burst when he held his breath while awaiting the explosive bolts to blow. Breathe out next time, Dave!)The reality level is not, however, '2001''s winning factor.It is the scope of the film that transcends all other SF movies - 'The Dawn of Man' to his ultimate incarnation. That is what the movie is about - no mystical mumbo-jumbo. Plain, simple Charles Darwin evolution - a theme that Arthur C Clarke has touched upon in other of his novels and short storys - that of the consciousness developing to the point where it can leave biology (body) and machine (cybernetic extensions) behind and become pure thought; pure logic. (Has 'Trek's' Spock been reading ACC?)That is not a foetus floating in orbit around Earth at the end - it is a representation of the rebirth of man. (Okay, so there is a little symbolic mumbo-jumbo!)The fact that this film was made *before* man landed on the moon is also another of its great achievements.The greatest achievement?That Stanley Kubrick pulled it off with such scintillating visual prowess.",9,0,2,16 June 2002
Cube," When you see daylight - LEAVE THE ROOM
","The concept behind CUBE is not new - the exploration of human nature is, after all, the premise for countless films. CUBE, however, manages to do this with an interesting and highly claustrophobic twist.But that's it - there is a twist at the end of this movie. One of those awful, pointless, non sequitur twists that spoils the entire 90 mins.Some twists are clever, intriguing and thought provoking. The twist at the end of CUBE is twist for twist's sake.This is why I say, 'When you see daylight - LEAVE THE ROOM' - because if you see the end of the movie you'll know you've wasted your time watching it.",6,1,2,21 April 2002
