Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Movie, but a too fast first half.
","I liked the movie very much. He's great, definitely StarWars, with good battles, action scenes and the slower parts where you meet the characters. But I think George wanted to put too much information and sequences in the first half of the film. They follow each other very fast and so it seems a bit chaotic. Kinda like, I have to tell them this but I don't exactly have the time to do it properly. Like the Gungan sub breakdown, it could have been a little bit longer like the Falcon stop inside the astroid. But once the movie reaches Tatooine he's fabulous. I like the ending very very much (the bad guy is very impressive) !! Good job George !!!",8,0,0,30 August 1999
