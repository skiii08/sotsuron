3:10 to Yuma," stupid movie
","Very disappointing. It started out okay but the last 1/4 of the movie was so incredibly stupid that it ruined the whole thing. I'm a big fan of 'modern' westerns (yes, i know it's a remake of a not so modern western), and I'm a big fan of Russell Crowe. This movie, however, was a total waste of time. The only reason that I'm even giving it a '4' is b/c I can see on my old ratings that I gave Jurassic Park III a '4' and I don't know that this movie was any worse... it certainly wasn't any better. I know, you want to watch it anyway and 'see for yourself'. Fine, go for it, but you will be doing yourself a big favor if you turn it off after the first 1:30h and just make up your own end to the story.",4,3,7,9 January 2008
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," They did it again - amazing!
","When I first saw the preview for this movie a couple of months ago I was very worried that it would just be a repeat of T2 with a cute chick thrown in the mix. Not the case at all! - The storyline was creative and 'realistic', the action was filmed beautifully, and there were no whining little 10 year olds for Arnie to babysit.  And to top it all off, the couple of Arnie one-liners were actually funny. Kristanna LÃ¸ken, aka T-X Teminatrix, was absolutely awesome!  She really nailed the part.  The look, the eyes,the bod, and the vicious killings really worked for me.  She's got a new fan. I just got back from the movie and I am already planning to go see it again. ASAP.Go see this movie.  You will not be disappointed.-Demon420 Official rating: 2 bongs up!",9,0,0,2 July 2003
The Waterboy," This movie is the devil!!!
","Adam Sandler at his best!  I've seen almost all of his flicks - I'm not a huge fan, but I give credit where credit is due.  I didn't find anything special about the Wedding Singer, and I thought that Billy Madison was 'ok' - But I thought that Happy Gilmore was absolutely hysterical and I think that The Waterboy is even better!  I have watched it several times already and it just keeps getting funnier!! A++",10,0,3,20 August 2001
True Romance," Tarantino-Violence and dialogue -AWESOME- A modern day Bonnie and Clyde
","This is my favorite movie.  The first 10 minutes are a bit corny but they just serve to set up the story.  The rest of the movie is non-stop action with appearances from by some of the coolest actors around! Would you just look at the cast!! Excellent, world class performances by all!  Patricia Arquette is HOT!!!",10,0,3,20 August 2001
