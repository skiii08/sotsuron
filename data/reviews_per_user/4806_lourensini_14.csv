Alien 3," Alien and Aliens is Overrated, and Aliens 3 Underrated.
","I've done a simple review about the two first movies, saying they're overrated for a series of reasons. Simply, they're not as perfect as people say.But Aliens 3 ain't that bad as people say neither.In Aliens 3, the black and blue atmosphere is shifted for a black and yellow. This represents better a prison and the best part: YOU CAN SEE WHATS HAPPENING ON THE MOVIE, what was the worse about the first movies (that was not scary, it was confusing).Of course ain't just that what makes me say Aliens 3 is underrated. But its because the first movies aren't that amazing. Aliens 3 had the capability to surprise me, what didn't happened watching its predecessors. It has lots more fun and action, and since Alien and Aliens didn't scared me a s**t, why would I consider the series as a thriller? Alien 3 has some similarities with first and second movie, even though it is a whole different one. By that I mean: alien will keep killing for fun, such as the company trying to protect it. But except that you will almost don't recognize it.In aliens 1 and 2, producers have gave to good actors forgettable characters, and in Alien 3, producers have gave to forgettable actors, pretty good characters. Even though those actors doesn't give us they best performances.As in Alien 3 as in Alien and Aliens, soundtrack doesn't do much beyond follow the film, so, don't expect to much from it.One problem I've had to notice in Alien 3 is the free gore stupid parts, like someone exploding when crashing into a real slow fan. We could pass without this.Since the first movies didn't leave any of those character in my memory i'm pretty sure I'm gonna remember some from Alien 3, because they were different, more original i'd say.Alien 3 has its issues, I must say that, but i can't talk about them without leaving you spoilers, but if people say those extremely boring first movies are so F*****g amazing, why tha hell would Alien 3 be so bad?",7,4,4,4 February 2012
Source Code," Messing with time it's always funny,
","Source code is above most 2011 releases. It provokes us to watch more and more, and makes us question whats going to come next. And the best part, it has the capacity to take us by surprise.Jake Gyllenhaal does an amazing job on his character, awhile Jeffrey Wright shows no emotion at all. All the other actors don't call attention at all.I wouldn't call Source Code as a Thriller. Well, it does it's job. But not enough to make me apprehensive. But i really wanted to see what was going on, this doubt is one of the best reasons to not read the synopses before watching. Let the movie drags you to it's world. One more thing about this is that Source code it's all about action and syfy. Quantic physics ain't so much syfy nowadays, but action movies doesn't have to be all about explosions and gunshots every 5 seconds. At this point, Source code really went great.The plot takes us by surprise almost every time and this is what can guarantee an overall rate to any movie.One of SOurce Code problems were that it's soundtrack looks like Harry Potter. No Kidding. We can almost see wands about to come out from people pockets.It's not always a movie can hold out attention for an hour and half without letting us down by the end. Source code is amazing at this point, too pity it's too short (but this is questionable).I'd recommend it more than just a pass-time, but as something to be watched again, to be understanded more than just the story itself.Watch like if you could go back not to just to change the future, but to understand the lives you haven't lived.",8,0,1,1 April 2012
Resident Evil: Extinction," Pretty faces and zombies.
","I must say i wasn't expecting i would rate it a 7. Not after the mindless Apocalypse. Well, RE Extinction does not offer a brilliant storyline or great acting. But presents us with some good twists.REE doesn't look like a movie per se. Actually, after you watch it, you get he sensation it is just a halfway to the fourth RE. It makes you want to watch its sequel right when you finish this one.Lets start with its issues: Too many beautiful people. Thats one of the reasons i liked Walking Dead. Why does all the characters must be pretty? what sense does it make? Is it really gonna attract more viewers? Nop. Pure bullshit. Pretty faces and organized hairs are the last matter in a post apocalyptic world. Its stupid to put it as a priority when choosing actors. So what happens is now we have half of the cast formed by poor actors, at least they're pretty and dress fashionably.Now, the Pros: AMAAAAAAAANZING SOUNDTRACK. I can compare this soundtrack with Transformers. Amazing and really well made sound effects pulls you inside the movie. And this is the best part of the whole thing. I'm really impressed, because its even better than first and second RE.Action scenes were better produced, along with zombies make up, what is probably because of technologies improvement. They have made a highly entertaining zombie action movie, even if it is not a brilliant film, has some power to catch our attention.Good to watch eating something caloric if ur looking for a mind relaxation.",6,0,1,30 March 2012
Alien," If you could at least see something on the screen...
","Directors must realize that ain't darkness that build a thriller. It's the plot. And I'm not going to do a personal review saying the movie is amazing just because Ridley Scott directed it.Alien is too much overrated. And except the fact it's a pretty original movie, it has nothing to call my attention. There ain't nothing amazing about the actors and the plot is mostly predictable. You can see whats about to happen since they get out from the spaceship to explore another lost ship in a distant planet. The Soundtrack follows whats going on in the movie, thats nice (or is the minimum music producers should do. But it ain't no The Untouchbles. The worst part is the constant dark screen. And when it ain't black, is black and blue. Of course, its supposed to create a thriller atmosphere. But it doesn't. It just makes you try to imagine what the f**k is going on through the hole movie. Actors perform well (but not impressively), at least if we compare this to Alien Ressuraction.The reason I'm giving it a six it's just because Alien its and amazing creature, smart and with incredible capabilities to procreate without and male (through parthenogenesis, I assume). And to kill whats near by it without even feel threatened.",6,5,10,3 February 2012
Predator," Much better than Alien (and it's impossible not to compare)
","Recently I've watched all the Alien movies, in order to catch up with the Alien vs Predator series. And since my reviews about Alien quadriology didn't ended up as I've spected, lucky o'my Predator is much more funny to watch.I've remembered when I was a kid I saw a horrible scene when there was people hanged upside down in a three without they're skin, and that scared me so much I could barely sleep at night. Haha, now I've faced one of my worst memories.Predator has its fails, and things could be improved, but its still amazing. Every scene Gran master Arnolds appears has the capacity to make the movie interesting, because you know his about to kick some asses. And better than that: Dutch personality ain't just like a juggernaut, his smart, combining muscle and mind at the same quantity.Carl Whethers does a pretty good job either, since you don't get flash backs of Rocky every time his character, Dillon, appears.Im not intend to talk about every character in this movie, but just to know: there ain't no similarities between one and other, what makes them remarkable. I'm pretty sure you'll get to the same conclusions after watch it.Along history goes, you'll feel the intensity of a great soundtrack presented in Predator (composed by Alan Silvestri), what is better than Alien (composed by Jerry Goldsmith). That happens because Predator it's more intense and the music continues along the action scenes. Like I said in review title, it's impossible not to compare one to other, but in soundtrack matter: Predator is better.The story line happen into closed forest, and I liked, because it changes from day to night what helps to 'renovate' movie atmosphere, it doesn't get boring like Alien and that Black and Blue along the whole thing.So, from the massive destruction to the chilliest scenes, Predator looks like a bipolar movie that captured my attention all along.But now a little bit of what could be improved.I really feel special effects could be better on this one. When predator appears, his silluet it too much 'offensive', and easily distinguishable. And His/It's lasers and shoots looks like paint made. Even if it's 1987, I know it could be a lotta better, and if you think it couldn't, take a look on Star Wars - Return of the Jedi (1983) and you're going to get the message.Predator is really an amazing movie, even better if you haven't enjoyed Allien. Definatelly a Must See!",8,1,2,5 February 2012
Warrior," Good part of this movie success comes with the time it was released.
","There are lots of good things in this movie. You won't see a bad acting, not even from the fight judge. I didn't remember when I've seen big muscled actors making bigger interpretations in a movie before, and those guys are f+++ing big. Warrior also give lotta attention to the fight itself, and half of the movie they're doing just that: fighting. And the fights look so real that actors probably got some injures while training and recording scenes (Tom Hardy, actually, broke some ribs and fingers from hands and feet broke up during shots). So, since half of the movie is based on the Sparta Championship, you get sucked into it.So far I've told you the good, now the bad comes in.1-I can be wrong, too bad I'm human, but the plot seems to have a lack in its story, because I didn't understand what made those brothers hate each other so much. Their dad was a drunk prick and screwed up with his sons, nice, but how exactly? I wanna know how. 2-The other issue is: you know what will happen every time. Is too obvious, from the begin to end. 3-Another missing in this movie is when Paddy (Nick Nolte, the dad) starts training his son Tommy. Well, there ain't a single scene whe he actually trains Tommy. 4-Certain movie point Tommy gets out for a walk and then he mets his brother Brendan. That would be OK if he could, like a divine inspiration, guess that his brother would be, alone and coming out of nowhere, appearing in the same spot as he was going. It could be a coincidence? Nops, watch the movie and you'll see how strange it is. 5-Everytime there's just two people talking each other in some ambiance, the scenes gets black and yellow. Even a movie nobody could handle such as Serbian Film could do better than this. Its boring to watch this set of lights because is kinda obfuscate the actors and doesn't let you to see they facial expressions. Nick Nolte did a great acting in this movie and in the first scenes his face gets hard to understand. 6-The first part of the movie, when you start to know the characters, you see a Tommy drinking like and idiot, just like if real MMA fighter could forget about they diets and do whatever they want with their bodies. You can't compare this behavior with a real fighter. It's stupid. And it was the first thing Rocky took care when he decided go back to the competitions (who doesn't remember Rocky waking up to drink 5 whole raw eggs? not exactly a pre-workout meal, but its something better than Tommy drinking like his messed up father).After watch Warrior I could just though that its success is due the time of release. We're just living the day MMA beated Boxe down and become a popular sport around the world. The day bodybuilding become so popular, we'll probably watch 'No Pain, No Gain' as a masterpiece. Since Warrior was a great success, producers will certainly try a sequel and I bet it will pass like, 5 or 6 years before this, just to explain what actions lead this family to ruins, because Now I just can't.",6,2,5,17 January 2012
Aliens," If you could at least see something on the screen...again.
","I've just reviewed Alien (1979) and here I'm about to say the same things: Aliens is overrated as much as its predecessor. You can't see much on the screen and again you gotta figure out whats going on. Some people say this darkness mixture with blue makes the movie scary and interesting, but comm om, it just makes it confusing. It's not even enough to scare us, but it was enough to make me bored. Acting here goes pretty much the same as Alien (since the first movie wasn't that exceptional), except for some short role characters interpreted by bad actors. But good news: the third and fourth Alien its about to get worse. Soundtrack passes by without get stuck in your memory, it just accomplishes it's role: follow the scene.Aliens plot gives you more twists than the first movie, but right in the end of the movie you gonna see something amazing: an Alien waiting to use the elevator. Isn't she brilliant?Since Aliens basically repeated it's predecessors formula, if you have enjoyed the first one, you'll like this. If you haven't, you'll agree with me.",5,3,9,3 February 2012
Resident Evil," An Almost Constant Soundtrack makes this an great cybernetic atmosphere
","Since I was 15 i've heard my friends talking about this movie. It's impressive a guy like me, that have had watched a thousand movies still didn't look for Resident Evil.Well, RE starts trying to make us want for more. Not just the first scene, but the whole movie. It didn't called my attention that much at the beginning, but te final scenes did. I wanna watch the sequence right now.The best about RE is it's soundtrack. It's what makes this movie convincing, entertaining, frightening and apprehensive at the same time. Even if the soundtrack isen't that original. It is pretty well placed in the right moments, and it's almost constantly throughout the movie. This , and not the scenario is what makes it have a cybernetic_high-tech atmosphere.RE's photography could really be better, a little bit more of dark would be welcome. And talking about photography, I also must say about special effects and GCI computer generated imagery). In 1999, Matrix have had presented us with amazing special effects and cgi, soon, I truly believe monsters could be improved 3 years later, in Resident Evil. Even if it's not the same company working on it.Actors are not that great and sometimes pretty bad, script is the easier ever written. I've watched on English (I'm Brazilian) and still did understand everything they were saying, giving the simplicity of it's language.RE is and entertaining film, won't add much at your knowledge, nothing like cult-movies or the most intelligent ones, but you'll like to spend some hours watching it.Cheers.",7,0,0,22 March 2012
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Mindless Bad Ass
","ADVISE: I HAVE NEVER PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE. THEN, EVEN IF IT'S BASED ON A GAME, I'LL TREAT IT AS A MOVIE WITHOUT CONSIDER THE VIDEO GAME.It's really rare to produce a sequence as good as the first movie. With REA, the same happens.Resident Evil (2002) has it's lazy moments, but at least, it is smarter than it's postcessor. In exchange, most film is reached with bad ass action scenes, fulfilled with a good soundtrack and better computer generated special effects.Unfortunately, those good points doesn't fill it's lacks, bad characters, bad interpretations and deficient plot. In REA we are obliged to believe that Umbrella's company is even worse than Monsanto selling Roundup. And for the biggest and most powerful company n the whole world, kill it's own soldiers seems to be real stupid to me.Except for what was already said, one thing is well though in this sequence: the capacity of a powerful company to manipulate the truth making it turn against it's releasers. That tell us to think again every time we hear about conspirations theories.A movie to turn off your brain, eat some popcorn and that's it.",5,0,1,22 March 2012
Limitless," A Phenomenon 'on steroids'.
","If you've watched Phenomenon and liked, you're gonna love this one! Limitless is the same idea, placed in a different way. This time the booster is a drug. Something like that already exists, only they don't have the same effect as NZT Eddie takes in the movie, and they're called Nootropic drugs, usually used in Alzheimer treatment and other degenerative diseases.The main character, its well presented right in the first 10 minutes, and makes you be caught by his history of live mistakes and frustration. He's f****d up, and couldn't be different.Limitless has a clear photography. The viewer never gets those black scenes where it's impossible to know whats happening. A pretty good visual art.In general, acting is good, not memorable, nor poor, stays in the between. But Bradley impresses.The best about Limitless is the plot, it takes you by surprise at 90% of the time. What is really an impressive characteristic, since 90% of the movies from 2011 suck at this point, really suck, and I've watched lots of them.Of course, you can't stop thinking about Phenomenon (1996) when watching Limitless (if you've had watched phenomenon), but actually, the similarities are only the '1000 QI points', because intelligence here is treated in a different way. It's more about 'what will I do now to get more money?' and not like 'oh, I'm super smart, now I can't stand a relationship'. Eddie is, actually, even more brilliant!Limitless is really one of the most exciting 2011 movies I've watched. It's dynamic, and didn't let me down any of his acts. Fun!",8,0,0,21 January 2012
In Time," A Brilliant idea! Not that brilliant executed.
","Taking off horrible car actions scenes and the unstoppable message of 'time is money', In Time is a brilliant movie, with an original idea (at least I haven't seen a movie treating the 'life span' like this one before).Timberlake does a good job on his character, and its impossible to see Johnny Galecki and do not remember him on The Big Bang Theory. Because his laugh is exactly the same, haha. Apart from these two, there is some bad actors doing poor acting. Something to take care of, if someone intent to make a sequel (or prequel, because how science evolved to the point on put a clock on people's arm and make them share life time like a USB cable from arm to arm is still a mystery).Right in first 10 minutes we can see we're about to get bored about how many times they will spend talking about time and enjoying life, and bla bla bla. Really, this was supposed to be subjected, and not repeated throughout the whole plot.Another issue is the car action extremely slowly moving scenes. Is this the best stunt man can do? They're clearly the worse part of the movie. They're so bad produced that we can see when the car is 'running' 5 miles per hour. Really, they suck.What salves In Time is photography and the fact producers used old muscle cars instead of prototypes in a futuristic scyfy movie. That was really a well though idea! Amazing! it gives a kind of retro atmosphere to it. Thumbs up! Apart for some mistakes, In Time is really a great movie. To bad it doesn't make you think like one.",7,2,3,28 March 2012
Rango," Rango, For the Love of Water.
","What would I expect from a movie called Rango with a lizard on it's cover if a haven't even read the synopsis before watching it? Yeah, it took me by surprise.Latelly we have a new Depp's movie like almost every month, and since he does the same job all of them, he's getting to repetitive for my taste. But Rango couldn't be done by another actor. This time, Depp has overcome my expectations, and he was brilliant. Another actors did an amazing and remarkable job, but the attention I've gave to Depp was because I wasn't expecting to much from him.Rango is fulfilled with an amazing soundtrack that is capable of stealing viewers attention every time it shows off. Characters design was also pretty well made and they also kinda remind me some actors I've seen before, like Kate Micucci (Raising Hope) and Beans.References to Fear And Loathin in LA was a plus, too bad I couldn't see another one like another viewers, but Rango has it's bonus.Visual art and character design deserve some attention too, and the atmosphere is also stunning.Plot ain't the best I've seen from an animation movie, there's lotta things that could be improved or changed (like every good movie has, since we humans has the 'power of creativity') and because of my constant pursuit of originality as an spectator, I did expected little bit of changes in the plot since I started to understand whats going on. Because of this predictability, I can't give Rango a an 9.But what about the message? Rango has a brilliant and expressive one: 'Who controls the water, controls everything.This is an Inconvenient truth, what's Rango is all about. Almost like a science fiction predicting future. We'll be re-watching Rango in 50 years from now in children's in primary schools to teach kids to better take care of the world and all that attitudes we'll be embittering off someday.Another problem in Rango was some moments characters could remain quiet but they wasted on old jokes. This is something we don't do nowadays if we wanna make an original film.Except two little things that could be done, Rango is amazingly well directed/produced/designed and performed movie. Worth 8/10",8,0,0,11 March 2012
Despicable Me," The Human Touch
","Despicable Me Has some issues, but it's 80% amazing.It touched me. And I don't remember Toy Story 3 provoking the same emotion or not even an emotion at all.Visual art is clear and simple. At least at a first look. Because if you give it more attention you can see amazing lights, shadows and reflexes effects. Faces expressions are also pretty well expressive. Even when they're simple like moving half a lip. You can feel what the character are feeling. This is hard to get even from an good actor...Soundtrack and other sound effect are also good. All voice acting are pretty well interpreted. Characters come alive.But the best part are those woompa loompas Gru's little helpers. They're are really funny in every scene they appear. And it's amazing they could be design so funny looking just like yellow capsules. NICE! It's simple and they walk funny, express funny, and talk funny.But Despicable Me misses on balance. If by one side, Gru doesn't take too little or too long to be attracted by the 3 little girls, the plot seems to forget very often the focus on how bad he is and his quest to steel the moon. Another issue is the way he does that could be better worked, because he spend just 5 to 10 movie minutes to do so.Once he becomes a better person, everyone around him becomes Mr Nice Guy too, and that's boring.Despicable Me is really a good movie and pretty well made, but some little issues takes away the chances for me to rate it as a 10.",8,0,0,1 April 2012
50_50," So you think you can bear its weight?
","I'm recently passed through a surgery to remove 2 herniated discs (at 21y), what is nothing compared to a cancer, but from this simple thing I could have a bit of an idea about how people who surrounds you can deal with it, and they suck with it. The movies told you that perfectly.Well balanced between comedy and drama, 50/50 shows the fragility of life when you think you're having a problems free one. Everything's OK, you go to work, you laugh with your friends, f**k your girlfriend and then, out of the blue, you have to accept you can die from one of the worst diseases a human being can have. The cancer. The movie makes you think if that happen to you how would you react, 'who would stay at your side?' 'who would fake you're OK?' 'who would lie to make you feel comfortable?'. Sometimes who's at your side can't bear the weight like you do.Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) its the 50% drama while Kyle (Seth Rogen) is the other part, fulfilled with black humor jokes, always trying to be the best friend to Adam, and so speak, the only one who can really pass throughout the disease without making Adam go down in tears and self-pity.Ketherine (Anna Kendrick) interprets a young psychiatrist, who has to treat a complicated patient, giving that she just started working at a clinic and has no much idea about what to say to him. The others actors and characters doesn't get much of our attention, except for Alan (Philip Baker Hall), a old men who's being treat from cancer at the same hospital as Adam and will certainly makes you laugh.The soundtrack is almost missed along the movie, and some characters are design to not know how to express themselves, witch leave some scenes with a 'lack of dialog' and you'll be willing to speak for them.Watch 50/50 trying to put yourself in Adams situation to see how life would look from your point of view. And see how fragile life is, doesn't matter how much solid things are.",8,0,0,16 January 2012
