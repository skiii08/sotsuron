The Avengers," Best movie ever!
","Do not know how someone could not love this movie. First of all Joss Whedon is a genius and everything he touches is gold. Beyond that, he has infused his witty sense of humor into the Marvel world so that this movie is by far the best superhero movie made to date.Avengers highlights the best of each character, giving each their time to shine without getting too involved with any one character. They are perfectly blended which creates a fun entertaining atmosphere for the audience.I could go on for forever on how great this movie is (gets even better the more you watch and pick up on things) just have to give it a shot, you won't be disappointed! BTW cannot wait for the Whedon created TV series S.H.I.E.L.D and of course Avengers 2. Love you Joss!!!!",10,4,9,27 September 2012
