3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to ridicule
","Before saying anything about this insult to good old western films I would like to wonder why, when 153 (plus this one) out of 293 user reviews describe this movie as awful... the score on her main page is 8.1 ????3:10 to ridicule,The story of a crazy, as cow, rancher taking a sentimental & very understanding criminal to take the trainÂ…A nice movie to watch while at hugs with your gal & trying to put up with her bitter comments of the bad guy not being as tough as he was bragging about the entire movie. Come on, I'm going to watch me a Brazilian soap opera next time a modern filmed western like this one appears.I liked a lot the bad guys main sidekick though. Who is killed in cold-blood despite all his efforts to save his 'boss'.ri-di-cu-lous",1,9,15,14 January 2008
Prisoners," Bullshite movie...
","A movie about an old lady kidnapping small kids and giving them drugs with a needle... Wow!!! and a parent losing it and torturing a guy with a deformed face in an abandoned property of his, which he cannot repair due to economic problems. I think that movie adds to the mission of cinema and cinematography in general. No wonder why there are so many weirdos overseas... And I have to write ten lines the least for my movie review to b posted. So I'll start say awful things about this movie... Don't even try to press play on this movie it doesn't worth it. The Spiderman guy tries to act as a detective and the Wolverine guy tries to act as a family guy. The first has a tick and I believe that's why this movie is having an 8.1 average in IMDb and the latter has a problem with alcohol and he can't be convincing for even a second. Ahhh my ten lines (or more) are complete. Go Away from this so called movie. GO AWAY!!!",1,25,59,4 December 2013
