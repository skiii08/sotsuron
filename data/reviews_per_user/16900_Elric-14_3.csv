The Blair Witch Project," Pointless, boring and annoying
","Not even close to being worth the hype. I was not frightened one iota by this wretched movie. The only disturbing thing about it was the motion sickness brought on by the camerawork. I saw it in a relatively crowded theater, and at the end, my unspoken sentiments were echoed by two or three other people who said 'That's it?'Next time, get the characters to start out competent and have them do things in the woods that real people would do...screaming and kvetching at each other gets old really, really fast.",2,0,3,4 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Flashy but flawed
","Before I say anything else, the special effects are nothing short of spectacular. Besides them, however, the movie is sorely hurting in a number of areas. While I disagree with most critics' panning of Liam Neeson (I think his detachment is perfectly appropriate for a Jedi), George Lucan needs to hire a decent editor, Ewan McGregor is sadly underused, Jake Lloyd ranks about a 6 on the child-actor-annoyance scale, and I was ready to throttle Jar Jar Binks after about 2 minutes. Natalie Portman, however, was a very pleasant surprise, and Darth Maul kicked major heinie. The most, and by the time it was over with basically only, interesting thing about the movie was how it so blatantly set up the next two (I can't wait for Senator Palpatine to reveal himself as Darth Sidious and whack the whole Jedi Council). All that aside, it was great eye candy.",5,0,1,1 June 1999
The Matrix," Whoa...Dude, that was a trip.
","This movie is impossible to describe. I never ever ever thought I'd ever be impressed by Keanu Reeves, but he was very good, and the special effects have to be seen to be believed. This movie may well supplant Austin Powers as my all-time favorite.",10,0,0,2 June 1999
