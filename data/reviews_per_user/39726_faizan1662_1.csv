The Expendables 2," armed monkeys
","If you want to imagine what will happen if you provide a bunch of monkeys with fire power, what would they do to this planet..thaa, thuu, thiskiyaaaon, dharr, dharrr dharrr... end of the movie. I do know for sure it'll be one of the reasons aliens won't talk to us or the reason bin laden bombs buildings... why USA is spending billions of dollars on armies, why don't they deploy these monkeys in Iraq or Afghanistan... This is the kind of entertainment that does not consider worth flying in a martial arts superstar Jet Li and as you have sit around firing a machine gun, stopping occasionally to deliver most awkward line readings of his career.",4,0,1,14 August 2014
