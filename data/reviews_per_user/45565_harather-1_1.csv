The New World," nature vs. civilisation, love vs. vanity
","Probably his best film ever. Shot in IMAX format. To be seen only on the big screen. The heart shattering destruction of a lively character and of a vibrant, childlike civilisation. The King of England seems like an Indian chief.The difference between the worlds is the perception of nature, one side feels as a part of it, the other one feels they can conquer it and so they did. The same goes with human nature, some live in it, others conquer.The ascetic believe of the Christians has no understanding for the tantric religion of the primitives. A must see for followers of the church of Cinema. Unfortunately words are not meant to describe it.",10,11,24,4 January 2006
