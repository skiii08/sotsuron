Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A bit dull really - includes SPOILERS
","***************** SPOILER WARNING ******************
I came away very disappointed with the ending of Kill Bill V2.  The first three-quarters of the film had me captivated, but it completely lost me once the Bride got to Mexico.  Half an hour of predictable and uninteresting talk and then a criminally short end fight.  After sitting through four hours of KB, I had at least expected a spectacular ending, but instead we saw a very short and amazingly predictable fight. Some of the acting in KB2 is awful. Michael Madsen, although very charismatic on screen is one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and seems lost unless he is doing the one emotion he has mastered, menace. 
Many people have been raving over David Carradine, and to be fair his performance when judged by his usual standards was pretty good, but when judged against a decent actor, would only appear mediocre.  Fortunately, Uma Thurman, Daryl Hannah and Gordon Liu are all awesome, so the film isn't all bad.I'd give it 6/10.",6,0,1,29 April 2004
The Ring," Don't waste your money, see the original instead!
","Once again Hollywood takes an excellent foreign film and produces a bland, uninteresting copy with no merit of its own.  Gone is the creepy atmosphere of Ringu, the urban legend theme that gave the original its believability is barely touched on and cheap shocks (which don't generally work) replace the genuine horror of the Japanese version. This is basically a cynical exercise in film making by numbers, cashing in on the original's notoriety.  I challenge anyone to come up with a Hollywood remake that even comes close to a foreign original.  Do yourself a favour and see Ringu instead.",3,0,1,4 November 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A masterpiece!
","Do you remember the feeling you had when you first saw Once Upon a Time in China?  You knew you'd just watched something pretty special.  I felt the same about CTHD.  I'm going to write this without including any spoilers, so apologies if something doesn't make sense.  It will do when you see the film!Firstly, this is a film that breaks a lot of conventions.  Just when you think you know what is going to happen, it does something different. Characteristically of director Ang Lee, it is the female characters who are the strongest.  Michelle Yeoh is, as you would expect from her, excellent both in terms of acting performance and her martial arts.  But the star of the film is Zhang Zi Yi  who I regret I know nothing about, who shows amazing speed and agility and takes her role suitably seriously especially in some of the sequences that are direct homages to genre cliches.  And she's cute too!  Chow Yun Fat once again puts in a sterling performance, given that he is not a martial artist, he didn't look out of place wielding a sword, although I thought one or two shots might have been over cranked.  In a couple of his previous films he has looked a bit out of place when it comes to fight scenes, but here he was fine.  Shows what a versatile actor he really is.The fight choreography is by Yuen Woo Ping, so you know it's going to be good.  Most of the fights are fairly stylised, lots of large sweeping moves and stances and all incredibly fast.  There is a lot of wire work of which I'm not a fan, but it's used to give the fights more of a ballet type feel and didn't detract from them at all.  The film has a steady sense of humour and keeps it up all the way through, which included interrupting one of the fight sequences with one of the best gags in the picture.Downsides?  Well a couple.  Stylistically, the film can't decide whether to be shot in a Western of Chinese style, so there is a bit of both which seemed to me like a compromise.  Whilst most of the fights are done in wide shot, there were some sequences done in close up which was even more annoying than usual because they were back to back with the wide shots.   I also thought the exposition in the middle giving Zhang Zi Yi some back story was too long, the point this was making could have been done in a far shorter time.I must say a word about the extras.  One of the things I always love about some of the old Shaw Brothers films is the fantastic faces you get on some of the extras.  CTHD has some of the best extras I have ever seen.  Loads of big, mean looking thugs with strange beards or moustaches carrying huge, weird and wonderful weapons.  It really adds a great deal to the character of the film.The audience I was with loved the film, cheering and clapping during the fight scenes and in all the right places.  There were unfortunately a couple of bits of unintentional laughter but I suppose that is to be expected. Because this film was made for a Western audience as well as an Eastern one, the subtitling is excellent, always clear and readable and making complete sense.  Those of you who haven't seen this film are in for a real treat.  I just can't wait for a chance to see it again.",9,0,0,8 November 2000
X2: X-Men United," Not really as good as the first film
","I enjoyed X-Men 2, but I can't help thinking that it isn't as good as everyone is saying it is and it certainly isn't as good as the first film. Sure, there are great effects and lots of action, but there are too many characters - some of whom have absolutely nothing to do - and the plot is overcomplicated and the film too long.  X2 lacks the characterisation and relationships that set the first film apart from others of the genre.  None of the characters has been developed, and the relationships that were so strongly built in the first film are sacrificed to give the action more screen time.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are both wonderful as always, the rest of the cast have little to do beyond flex their super powers.",8,0,0,14 May 2003
Gladiator," Don't believe the hype!
","Now don't get me wrong, Gladiator is not a bad film, it simply isn't as good as everyone seems to be saying it is.  For some reason it has captured the imagination of what I call the James Bond audience, the people who only go to the movies once or twice a year and this has artificially inflated it's rating. There are plenty of other people writing about how good the film is, so I'm going to concentrate on it's flaws.Firstly, it is far too long.  Clearly the producers wanted to make an epic like in the old days, but they seemed to have assumed that epic means length.  Wrong!  I'm sure a half-decent producer could have taken at least half and hour out of the film.  It takes far too long to get going.  After the inital battle, which for me was the high-point of the film, there is no action for about 45 mins.  This is the point where the plot takes place. The problem is, the characters are all so cardboard that the audience can easily work out what the plot is about, and five minutes here would have been more than ample.The fight scenes were some of the worst I have ever seen.  You would think Ridley Scott (or his second unit director) would have seen The Matrix, a Jackie Chan film, or at least one Martial Arts film.  That is how to direct an interesting fight; long, stationary shots showing off the skills of the stuntmen, not close-ups and constant irritating cutting on movement.  It was impossible to work out what was going on in most of the fight scenes.Thirdly, there is far too much CGI.  Yes it was impressive to recreate the Coliseum, but then they ruin the effect with overkill.  And the CGI tigers were absolutely awful.  Surely real tigers would have been cheaper and far more impressive.Fourthly, historical accuracy...  oh we don't need to bother with this, after all, it's only a movie...And don't forget the wonderful array of accents!I can't help comparing the film to Ben Hur or Spartacus and I'm afraid that Gladiator comes a poor second in terms of story and spectacle.",6,0,0,5 June 2000
