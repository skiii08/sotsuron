The Incredible Hulk," Worst movie ever! ! !
","I saw two movies on the same day, The Happaning and Hulk. I loved The Happening and hated the Hulk.I guess I am getting too old for this type of films.I am sure if I was younger I'd love it.It is a wonderful movie for kids not adults.Good movie for the younger.I personally prefer a more complex storyline.But I am sure kids will love it.I suggest seeing The Happening instead.But if you are young then I'd recommend The Hulk.I give it 1/10 Worst movie I've seen in years ! ! !",1,14,42,14 June 2008
