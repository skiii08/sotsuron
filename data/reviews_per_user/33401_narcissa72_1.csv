Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette
","Marie Antoinette is not historical accurate movie and it is also very slow, still I love this movie. I see the film as Sofia Coppola's interpretation and view of who Marie Antoinette was in her personality. It is her interpretation of the world she lived. Sofia Coppola has done is not really a movie about Marie Antoinette - it's a movie what it is to be the queen and alone. I like scenes from Versailles and Trianon. As long as one sees the film as a fairy tale and not a historical film about Marie Antoinette the movie is very good. I would like the film a 10 I like the atmosphere and the pictures given - but it's all too much historical facts are wrong and it pulls down my rating.",8,2,3,6 October 2014
