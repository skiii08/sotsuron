Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Best Character Performance Ever
","Sasha Baron Cohen jumps into the role of 'Borat', fully committed to letting Borat do what Borat does. The first time I watched Borat, I didn't know that most of the filmed situations were actually real, but later that knowledge spiced up the experience even more (I've watched this movie quite a few times)!The character of Borat is innocent in his ignorance, but totally sexist, racist, antisemitic, anti-feminist, and just quite simply politically incorrect in just about everything he thinks or does. And the reactions and looks on the faces of the people he meets, make for some hysterical moments!Cohen plays this part quite unapologetically, delivering an absolutely unparalleled experience to the viewer. This kind of devotion is amazing to watch, and reminds me of Chaplin, who had his crew film even when something went dangerously wrong.The result is a captivating work, that saved the year for me in terms of movies. Nothing else I saw that year comes close, and quite frankly, very few titles in the whole history of cinema do. I still find myself waking up in the morning sometimes, laughing at a scene I've recalled from Borat.Original concept, great implementation. Full points for this one. 'Great Success!'",10,0,0,12 January 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Wonderful adaptation of a loved tale
","I watched this in 3D, and this was the first 3D-movie I ever saw that works as a 3D-movie. The scenes were adequately bright not to make the scene blurry, as has been the case for me in some titles...The Indiana Jones -style of cozy lighting, and antique furniture etc. makes for a nice atmosphere. I like how the characters have been rendered: as almost life-like but still comicky.The only minus I have, is the excessive action scenes. The palace-escape scene was too long, and crazy. But perhaps this is what Herge would have wanted. I don't know. But I didn't care for that.The best part was when Haddock memorizes the stories of his ancestry.",8,0,2,19 December 2011
