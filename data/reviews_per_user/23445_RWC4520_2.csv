The Blair Witch Project," Total waste of time and money
","Empty plot, stupid characters, horrible language....this is one that is definitely worth missing.  I found it a total waste of time.  No one else that I have spoken with thought it was worth seeing.   It reminded me of a made-up ghost story told around the campfire when I was a kid....and they weren't scary even then.",Null,0,2,2 August 1999
Armageddon," Complete waste of time and money
","This movie was one of the worst I have seen in years. Everything was predictable, the characters were caricatures, the dialogue was banal. The film was an insult to the intelligence.",1,1,4,4 November 1998
