Skyfall," close your eyes and bond over
","Who the flower gave 7.9 to this totally brain dead production? Even if there is nothing to spoil what could ruin the suspense, because there is none,let's whisper: 'Take the bloody shot!' Well, let's melt this sentence on our tongues. It meant, shoot the bad guy even if you hit the good one too. And we don't talk about some collateral damage here, we talk about our hero. This is the opening of an awful construction without any sense, humor or inner logic. Plot as plot can: Apparently somebody knows all the codes and secrets of MI6 and is able to hit them badly, yep, just blast the headquarter. Nobody can do anything against it. Even not the politicians in the Westminster Palace can be saved from this man - deep frustrated, apparently homosexual ex-MI6 sociopath-agent Javier Badem - who storms in with a bare pistol in his hand. Yes, they're truly lost down there in London. So tremendous lost, that the story finally leads to the childhood house of James Bond in the Scottish wilderness. This is the last resort where him an M seems to be save. Sure, it's just a bait, and sure, the old housekeeper is still there. Now: Three against the evil. We just miss Pater Brown up there in the highlands and the steamy moor. Beside this facts of raging stupidness it dismantles Bonds background secrets as an agent and as well as his character. Like conspiracy in own matters the myth of a serial hero has gone forever: Thank you for watching.",1,8,18,22 February 2013
