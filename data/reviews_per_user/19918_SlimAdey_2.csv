Catch Me If You Can," One Spielberg will want to forget
","Tom Hanks, Leo Di Caprio, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Steven Spielberg - how can you go wrong? Very easily by all accounts watching this film.After an hour and a half I couldn't wait for the credits.I almost sunk into a coma when after 2 hours the film appeared to be ending only for it to drag on for another 20 minutes.With some better editing and a more cohesive plot (rather than a sequence of scenes) this film could just about get away with it, if it ran for 90 minutes.Unfortunately none of these apply.",4,3,14,13 May 2005
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Far far far far worse than I'd feared
","The LOTR Trilogy was spectacular but somehow I'd missed the Hobbit so I decided to binge watch all three movies over the course of 3 nights. Having read the book a number of times in my youth I was somewhat surprised that they had made a 9 hour trilogy of this work and I set my hopes fairly low that this series would deliver. An Unexpected Journey came nowhere near my low expectation and I considered not watching The Desolation of Smaug but I did and I wasn't surprised that,if anything this film was worse than the first. My masochism must have kicked in at this point as I forced myself to watch the third and final instalment - The Battle of the Five Armies that set a new standard in awful. What the hell was this slash fest all about? I had to wind back the sequence when Thorin dies three times before I could make any sense of it I still failed. He's stabbed in an area of his chest as close to his heart as you could get yet still manages to kill his adversary and then gets up to have a walk round with no sign of a wound!! he then collapses and dies.# What was all that about? Dreadful series of films. I'm annoyed with myself that i wasted 9 hours of my life watching it.",1,7,11,20 May 2017
