Requiem for a Dream," Bleak, but brilliant
","I think it is fair to say that this is a film that unquestionably does not take its subject matter lightly. When approached with an open mind, this film will suck you in, and give you insight into the most foulest depths of depravity and denial that addiction can bring.The casting, cinematography and editing are excellent, and allow you a perspective into a world that most us have no understanding of, and in parts make you honestly despair as you are drawn into the whirlpool of desperation the characters inevitably slip into. Its almost harrowing to watch, but worth every second of the runtime. Although not it's intention, nothing else could portray the destructive effects of drugs better.",9,1,3,23 October 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Don't believe the hype
","I love Tarantino movies. In the past all his movies have had razor sharp dialogue, brilliant set pieces, great pace and plenty to keep you compelled. And for this reason, I gave two hours and thirty three minutes of my life to watch it. I really wish I hadn't. With the exception of Waltz and Kruger, the acting is pure ham. Tarantino should definitely give up casting Hollywood 'buddies'. I didn't get any sense of perspective from the story - was there a point to any of it at all?! Rambling scenes followed, and the general pace of the film was slow and limp, asides from the occasional abrupt burst of violence which often simply stopped characters from developing further. I found it very hard to feel anything for the antagonist in the movie and Brad Pitt's constant over the top accent and overacting just made me want to watch his scenes with the sound muted. Definitely Tarantino's worst film to date...a far cry from the directorial skill behind Pulp Fiction.",2,8,14,2 May 2010
