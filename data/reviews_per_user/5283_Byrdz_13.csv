The Blair Witch Project," Sadly it's an 'awful' One
",This picture had so much potential to be great. I had heard about it for years and had it on the VHS shelf forever but had not read much detail about it. I had heard glowing reviews when it first came out. It being Halloween week I finally decided to give it a whirl.The first time Heather dropped the Conversational F-bomb I did an internal uh-oh. When she 'interviewed' the crazy lady she constantly interrupted her and completed her sentences... another nasty trait of the lead character.The 'dialogue' which I have now read was impromptu is non-existent. Because (mostly) SHE has sworn so much when she is not upset she is left with nothing more to say so she just yells bleepables louder. I gave up after 33 minutes and only stayed that long because I did not want to be mocked by my fellow viewers .. one of whom actually said .. 'That film was in pretty good condition for having been in the camera in the woods so long' ... HE thinks it really IS a documentary.This COULD have been a good scary movie but the 'script' was so lacking that it just did not work for me. If you object to pointless swearing ... give this one a miss despite what the cult-fans say !,Null,1,2,27 October 2015
Mulan," One of the better ones.
","Mulan stands out as one of the better films from the Disney Studio. Perhaps because it is a tale that is not familiar enough to see how the Disney Studio did a hatchet job on the original story ((Cough... Hunchback... Cough!)) That being said and gotten out of the way, the Hero(ine), Hero, Sidekicks (human, insect and dragon variety) are all well presented and entertaining. The story moves right along and the songs actually add to the film rather than being mere distractions.The Villain looks like Jack Palance and it might have been a great idea for him to have done the voice but...Give it a go ! It is quite a good film.",Null,1,1,11 December 2016
The English Patient," Worth a re-watch.
","I watched 'The English Patient' a few years and pretty much agreed with Seinfeld's Elaine's assessment ... 'when is he going to DIE ???' BUT, the film being on my shelf and it being an award winner and not having been seen for quite a few years, I decided to give it another try.I am very GLAD that I did. It is an excellent, though complicated, romantic love story. The acting is all very very good. The scenics are very similar in quality to 'Lawrence of Arabia' and that is saying a lot ! I found it interesting to see actors who are now familiar to me but who, on the first viewing, were total strangers.All in all.. worth a watch or a re-watch !",Null,3,4,27 October 2015
Tangled," If for nothing else, watch it for the horse !
","Yes ! You read that correctly ! If for nothing else, watch this one to see THE HORSE !!!! His name is MAXIMUS. He is a very large white horse with attitude. He moves like a dog and he seems to think like a dog as well. He snuffs along the trail of the hero.. At one point he even sits on his haunches and when that sweet spot under his chin is scratched, he starts to kick himself with a hind leg. Found him IRRESISTIBLE !!! He and the hero have a brief Wile-E- Coyote / Roadrunner encounter on a tree branch. SUPER ! Oh, Tangled also has a very appealing Lost-Kidnapped Princess as Heroine and a delightful smoldering (his word) thief turned hero. The hero's gang of miss-fit-thief pals is supercalifragilistically amusing. There is a good ensemble song as well. Almost forgot the Villainess (hissss booooo). She looks a lot like Cher and sings up a storm like a Broadway Diva. Again... TERRIFIC ! Disney required mascot, Pascal (a chameleon) this time around is rather over-shadowed in appeal by Maximus. Remember him ?. He just turns colors and makes hand movements that aren't really clear as he only has two fingers and little hands.The animation is incredibly well done. There is a frying pan (with a large part in the proceedings)that looks as it it is really there and mighty even be a real frying pan. All the marks and dimples are just right. the scenery and special effects are also 'just right'.There is a trio of little girls who have their day made when a lady with 70 feet of shining golden hair enters their city.Little 'bits' abound in this wonderful and rather neglected film from the Disney Company ... their 50th Animated offering and for me, one of their best.",Null,2,3,3 February 2016
The Thing," If you like gore
",If you like gore and explosions more than a clear story this one is for you. The techy talk was awfully fast and all that running through tunnels was a bit much. It was even hard to tell who was who what with the parkas and the beards and the yelling last names at one another without any clear introduction as to just who was which. They were looking for 'Blair' and I thought that he was a totally different character.The opening shot with the helicopter and the dog were pretty cinematically impressive. The explosions and gore were also impressive BUT awfully repetitive. The only jump worthy scene was during the 'blood tests'. That actually got a 'whoa !' reaction.Not a fan of this type of film and I did prefer the 'original'. EDIT: Re-watched the original just now and see that the Font for the TITLE was the same ! Cool.,Null,2,7,8 January 2016
Edward Scissorhands," Oh Dear , I wanted so to love it.
","I had seen this one before and had a vague on the positive side memory of it. It was being discussed on the IMDb board and many praised it to the skies. Curious, I re-watched it. Possibly a mistake.STILL have no clue as to why 'The Inventor' gave his creation not only scissors for fingers BUT long, unwieldy, multiple fingers ! The hands are not only useless but in the way. This plot hole is INCREDIBLY distracting !!! That plot problem aside ... the MUSIC is the best thing about the picture. Danny Elfman is the best when it comes to Burton films.Johnny Depp, Wynona Ryder and Diane Wiest shine at what they are given to do. Peg is one of the best film moms ever. The supporting characters acting-wise are aces. The villainous bully boyfriend is hateful and hated so he was also doing his job. The cop who is kind to Edward is a really interesting addition.I do wish that I loved this film as I like fantasy stories and such and usually like Burton's quirkiness BUT this one ... not so much.",Null,0,0,16 February 2016
Man on the Moon," Like Latka and want to keep liking him? Be careful what you watch.
","I liked Latka. Not the best character in 'Taxi' and they took to featuring him in the story lines way too much for me but in small doses he was fun.I didn't know Andy Kaufman's other works and had no idea who his obnoxious nightclub 'singer' persona was. I didn't know about the fake 'wrestling' and 'feuds' or the 'dead lady on stage' 'gag'.I don't like 'practical jokers' ever. At all. No-one. So, the 'real' Andy Kaufman would have been someone I would avoid.Carrey was really very good but I now actively dislike Kaufman and would never want to watch the film again, ever !Spoiler .... what is the ending saying ? was it another Andy 'joke' or not ?",Null,1,1,1 April 2017
Moulin Rouge!," Skip it. Skip it, NOW!
","I never, ever have written a 'review' of a film I have not finished watching. Until now.Consider this a public service warning. SKIP IT ! NOW! Unless you really like to listen to contemporary songs in a 18th Century setting being sung by non-singers, skip it.Unless you really really like to look repeatedly at close up shots of lace and taffeta clad women's crotches, skip it.If all you want is a well photographed film of a pretty stupid story with totally obnoxious characters, then this one is for you. If not, (all together now) skip it. I wish that I had.",Null,2,5,1 April 2017
Mission: Impossible," Blow something up, run away, yawn .
","If you are making a 'blockbuster' type movie, first thing ya' really have to do is introduce the characters and make the viewer actually care a whit what in the world happens to them. You have to have a plot that you don't have to take notes on to even remotely follow. You need to have something more than special effects and explosions if you want a picture to appeal to more than one 'fan-base'.For me, 'Mission Impossible' failed on too many levels. I really wanted to like it. I really did. BUT, I didn't.Too muddled. Too twisty. Too many explosions and deaths. Just did not care what happened to any of these people and eagerly awaited the end of the film.",Null,0,0,23 February 2017
Groundhog Day," Hate to wait a whole year to watch it again.
","It has become something of an annual event to watch 'Groundhog Day' ON February 2nd or as close to that date as can be arranged. Which is GREAT except that the 'house rule' only permits a once per year viewing. This is one that keeps getting better and better and better.It was originally seen as 'just' a comedy BUT as years have passed and the film has been re-watched and reviews and analyzes of it have been noted, the depth of it have become more apparent. It's FUNNY as all heck. But it is also incredibly sad and in many cases incredibly moving and almost heart-breakingly so.When first seeing Phil Conners this year, my first reaction was ' I hate this guy... he is a snarky bully'. This is the first time that I reacted to him quite this negatively, btw. BUT as the film progressed and he realized exactly what was happening to him but not WHY, he became something / someone quite different. One of the most BRILLIANT decisions of the film makers / writers was to NOT tell us just WHY this happened to Phil ! Actually, it's done so well that I never even asked this question .. it just WAS ! The entire cast is just right. Reading about who was considered for the role brought forth 'what were they thinking?' The cast just WORKS ! Watch it. Watch it again. And again. It's that kind of a picture. Layered.. multi-tasking... GREAT !Feb. 2, 2017. STILL great. 'Keep trying until you get it right'.",Null,1,2,3 February 2016
Speed," Real life has changed how we see some movies.
","If I had written a review of 'Speed' in 1994, it would have praised the special effects, the thrills, the tension, the uber-villainy, the charming comic relationship between Keanu and Sandy ...BUT: I watched 'Speed' this week for the first time since 1994. The world has changed. Totally and irreversibly changed. Villainy is real and in our face. Explosions occur on a daily basis. It's just not fun to watch any more.It was a good movie. I supposed that it still is. It's just that I could not enjoy it the way that I did back then.",Null,0,0,1 April 2017
Rear Window," As it might have been reviewed in 1954
","Oh WOW !!! Did I just see a peach of a picture. It's called 'Rear Window' and it's sure a doozey.That nice Jimmy Stewart is in it but he doesn't get to move around very much as he's stuck in a wheelchair the whole picture.His girlfriend is played by Grace Kelly who is just pretty enough to be taken for a princess. She hasn't made many movies yet but I just know that she will have a very long and successful career in Hollywood.Thelma Ritter is terrific (as usual) as Jimmy's nurse and she really should get nominated for an Academy Award but the way things go, she probably won't be.Outstanding as the bad guy neighbor is some fella named Raymond Burr. What a bruiser. I cannot for the life of me imagine him ever being hired to play anything other than a villain... no way! not ever ! Anyway, enough chattering ... go see this latest Hitchcock movie. You won't regret it.",Null,1,5,19 November 2016
Beetlejuice," Hurrah... I liked it. I really liked it !
","Have been feeling sort of negative with the films I have re-watched lately and it's good to find one that I still enjoy as much as I did the first go-round.Alec Baldwin is great and so young he's nearly un-recognizable. Geena Davis A++. Silvia Sidney so cool as the case worker Juno. Wynona perfect as the Gothic child. Heck.. all of the actors are fun ! Michael Keaton, too, disgusting creature that he is, he makes ya laugh out loud, as they say. Special effect all over the place ... well done.The Music !!! Danny Elfman again. The use of the Calypso music is just perfect. Burton films are so enhanced by the music.If you've not seen it... Watch it. If you have, you know what I'm talking' about !",Null,1,1,16 February 2016
