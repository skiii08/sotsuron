Blade Runner 2049," Don't fall for the hype, this is a thin patchwork of incoherence
","Let me start with the length. I like long movies, properly done, they give you an extended, hopefully rewarding experience. But first, that experience has to be generated. I am not sure what experience this sequel is working toward. It is very vague and amorphous and extremely patchy. The patches do not work toward a cohesive whole. It is as if they will need another movie of equal length to make it coherent and to finally find some meaning (I am sure that idea was/is being kicked around). A slapped together, disjointed, virtually incoherent mix of settings, characters, images, dialogue, etc. sums up the essence of this movie. This is amplified by how these elements are obviously borrowed from other films. 
 
Considering the visuals, we get some interesting tricks that are amusing for a moment but they serve as distractions from the thin, hazy plot. 
In the original, the viewer is allowed to immerse them-self into the dystopic Los Angeles and get a feel for it. That dystopia was absurd and beyond unlikely in many ways but the richness and consistency with which it was presented made it easy to accept it temporarily. Not here, instead we get absurdity for sure but internal logic is not even attempted. We get a very strange place that is never explained and never makes sense. Are we so dumbed down as viewers that we just accept any mishmash of extreme images wrapped in fog as a coherent and believable vision-of-the-future? 
 
Dialogue? Being vague and pseudo-cryptic with some cynical clichés does not equal being profound or meaningful. 
 
There are very few characters of any kind here and by the end, I did not care about any of them, even Ryan Gosling's 'protagonist'. There is leftover sympathy for Harrison Ford's Deckard but they don't help it along much and there is not much for him to do. By the time he shows up, one is momentarily hopeful that something interesting will finally happen. But instead he just passively folds into the slowly swirling mess. The dog that hangs out with Deckard for a while might have been the most sympathetic creature. At least he/she might have been a creature. Keeping track of who/what might be human, replicant, or hologram is not easy. Again, this is a huge contrast to the original that had a large number of substantial characters. 
 
Another symptom of the patchwork is the number of wasted clichés and theatrical name dropping. For example, Dave Batista had a small part that he does well but which was incidental at most. Edward James Olmos was back from the original just so they could say he was there. These bits attempt, but fail to paper over the fact that very little actually happens. We don't even get any good fight scenes. (one tries to find a silver lining and fails) 
 
If you missed this movie, please don't worry, there are better ways to use the time. In fact, you will be better off as your memory of the original will not have the shadow of this cast over it.",4,5,9,15 June 2018
The Big Lebowski," starts nowhere, goes nowhere and not funny
","This is a cut and paste mishmash of caricatures and stereotypes (as most Coen movies are). The shame is that the caricatures are awkward and insult one's intelligence as well as the targets of the caricatures. They even manage to insult and degrade 1930s musicals. All that might be partially forgivable if it was funny but it never gets past the cringe stage. As for the story. There really isn't one. There is just an excuse to wander from one absurd, meaningless, barely coherent scene to the next. In one sense, it is truly post modern, i.e. there is no meaning, no theme other than impossible, dysfunctional characters thrown together to no purpose and you cannot feel good about any of it or take away anything useful from watching them.Critics and people in the industry seem to give not just the benefit of the doubt to the Coen brothers. Any paint they throw at a wall is hyped and sold as some kind of high art. But there might be method to that madness. If this kind of thing can be elevated to high art, it allows anything slapped together with a splash to be likewise elevated. In the mean time, movies as an art form and a cultural expression are down graded again while presumably the profits continue to flow. If that is what is going on, then this movie starts to make sense.The only redeeming things I can see about this movie is that John Goodman tried to do something with the wretched material he was given and Sam Elliot just manages to maintain his dignity as the writing and directing attempts to drag him down into ridiculousness. But if I think about it too long, I might conclude that they became caricatures of themselves. Again, that might be forgivable if it was funny, but it isn't.As for Jeff Bridges, he seems to be deliberately trying to act badly, i.e. blatantly artificial. To what end, I am not sure. Did the directors want that? Possibly, the Coen brothers have certainly used unnatural characters before.Did Juliane Moore enjoy her incomprehensible role? It didn't make sense even in the vacuous context of the movie.Please don't fall for the hype. See garbage for what it is. This is not classic or significant in any positive sense.",2,4,11,1 May 2019
The Last Legion," Truly bad, bad, bad
","Usually when a movie is bad, I just let it a pass and don't say anything because others will be doing that. In this extreme case, I have to drive another nail into the coffin.Plenty of money was spent on costumes, on-location shooting and some actors whose names you will notice and an actress who will look good no matter what she is doing. That is where you can end the positives. Everything else is very low quality and in some cases, unbelievably bad. What you get is a children's fantasy comic book with stiff acting, cliché writing and nonsensical fight choreography. One keeps hoping that if they had the wisdom and integrity to shoot on site and not resort to computers that the awkwardness will end and a good stretch of the movie will begin. It never happens. Rai and Kingsley are especially misused/miscast although Rai of course looks good always. They have to milk her looks quite hard as nothing else goes well. Even the good locations are not used to their full potential.",2,3,7,9 October 2012
Dunkirk," Tries to be 'artsy', doesn't amount to much
","I appreciate when a film-maker tries to do something different. In this case, we have someone thinking or pretending they are doing something different. We get a non-linear story line that jumps back-and-forth in time. We get some moody, underplayed music instead of loud, militaristic music. That was a bit refreshing at first. We get an emphasis on the lower ranks struggling to do their tasks and survive. We get little insight into the larger picture or how the situation arose in the first place.
In the end, it still boils down to a low key propaganda film. The Germans are entirely faceless and amount to some kind of vague encroaching evil force. The British are very human, vulnerable, forgiving and guiltless and yet heroic. Just so perfect. In the end, this is another WW2 propaganda film wrapped up in a different package and tied off with the obligatory Churchill speech. I say different as it is different than more bombastic propaganda such as Saving Private Ryan but it is not original. Frankly, it reminded me of the remade Battlestar Gallactica. Stylistically, it is a close relative.",4,1,4,3 April 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," a definite step down from part 1
","People often worship this part of the trilogy but it was effectively ruined by the grossly unrealistic portrayal of the battles. A bit of rudimentary research could have prevented that up but Peter Jackson, who otherwise has a great eye for detail, clearly didn't respect his material or his audience enough to do his work properly, or, he was badly advised.spoilers followFor example; One does not launch mass cavalry charges down steep slopes. Anyone who has ever rode on a horse would know this. Historically, people have not been so crazy as it inevitably would lead to a mass pile up at the bottom and a complete disaster. One also does not charge cavalry directly into a well formed pike formation even on flat terrain, let alone down a slope. It is suicidal and skilled, experienced soldiers would avoid such tactics as a matter of routine.There were other very badly handled scenes but I won't start listing them all but they are there for anyone to see. It is really disappointing to create such wonderful costumes, bring in lots of motivated extras and state of the art SGI effects and then neglect to do even the most rudimentary research on the simple physics of battles (let alone intelligent tactics). It is also disappointing that the viewing public accepts such incompetence as justifiable 'artistic license'.As an analogy, think of an otherwise well produced WW2 movie that portrayed soldiers and equipment doing things that were physically impossible or downright crazy. Wouldn't that hurt any film that set itself up to be an epic?",6,6,11,15 September 2005
Taken," Reasonably good concept but with predictable, formula execution
","This movie starts off with a workable plot, maybe even a good one. Certainly it had possibilities. Thereafter, it retreats to a predictable mash of violent, adrenaline rushes with cliché dialogue (one liners, come backs, etc) that any movie watcher over the last 30 years must have had their fill of. Once the plot is set, you knew generally how it would pan out. It was just a question of which country the gangsters were from, exactly who their accomplices and enablers were, and how many brutal fight, car chase and shooting scenes there would be. And also, what kind of gadgets would be used. It is all worn-out formula. 
 
Liam Neeson does okay with the material such as it is, I guess, but you almost expected him to morph into Bronson, Van Damme or even Arnold. Yes, Neeson suggests a more complex, interesting character but it is only a suggestion. Everyone else is barely there. It is entirely a Neeson vehicle. And forget about seeing any interesting directing, camera work or art direction. 
 
If this type of thing is your cup of tea, enjoy but don't look for ANYTHING special.",5,0,2,30 December 2017
The Good Shepherd," uneven and gives away few secrets, a lost opportunity
","For sure there are people who found this moving to be revealing and perhaps shocking. However, if you were already aware of the real history of the 20th century, it is soft, almost pablum. Only once does it start to really cut through the hype and deception and start to get at reality. I won't give it away directly but look for it during an interrogation. Most of the acting is effective and at times, excellent. Angelina Jolie is probably the biggest acting disappointment but her material was one of the weakest parts of the writing and it could be argued that giving her that role was not a good casting decision. In fact, the entire handling of the marriage and relationship between Damon and Jolie felt more like an awkward sub-plot rather than one of the main building blocks of the film which it was. The set direction and lighting were very good. The camera angles and editing were conventional and relaxed but there are times when one gets the impression that some more dynamic work in those areas could have added to the movie.",6,1,2,15 November 2009
Centurion," Seriously flawed, partly rescued by good on-location shooting
","I managed to enjoy the movie because of the on-location shooting. We don't get much of that anymore. The many small mistakes, use of clichés (both in dialogue and action) and the continuous abuse of history were hard to take. Likewise the adrenalin surge style directing and lack of good dialogue and proper character development amount to lost opportunities. It could have been soooooo much better. Really, I would like to kick the director and the producer in their heads. They had the potential to make something really special and missed the target by a wide margin. The ending seemed to set up for and hint at some kind of a sequel. Maybe they will do better with that. It wouldn't be too difficult. Make it longer, slower, more dialogue to explore the characters and respect the viewer by being more faithful to history.",5,3,6,8 October 2012
Prometheus," An expensive, pretentious waste of time
","Prometheus is almost without any redeeming characteristics. It is a recycled, old hat, extremely pretentious waste of money and talent relying on a mix of attempted but misguided gross-outs and pseudo-intellectual babble. Despite the money spent on state-of-the-art effects, the visuals do not generate suspense or awe. It is all tired and since they are not added to a satisfying storyline or great characters, they just coldly glide past the viewer. The supposedly big original thought about humans being engineered by extra-terrestrials is not new. It is a very old idea but they wanted to add something new to the Alien franchise. Ridley Scott himself has alluded to the fact that he wanted to make something original rather than a straight prequel. I think they would have been better off with a straight prequel. The twist they add to the Alien universe is forced and a let down. They just had to bring in that theme even if it meant permanently messing up a conceptual framework that had worked. The dark, shadowy atmosphere of Alien is there but it is really tired and over done here. It seems to be there just to be there rather than contributing to anything in particular and also to confirm that, lest there be any doubt, this is part of the Alien franchise. We get some action and gore as expected but again, it seems just to be there because it has to be. It is not suspenseful or interesting and it gets very cartoonish at times. A word about the acting; these people had little to work with and were being directed in a context that went nowhere, so they cannot be blamed. Some of them had to physically work hard so you can say they tried. As for the dialogue. Well, I am shocked that there are people who actually think the drivel in Prometheus is interesting, significant or insightful. Is this what we have come to? My heart is sinking. The more I think of it, my rating of 3 is perhaps too high but given the production talent and money spent, some viewers might find that worth something and it could have been even worse so a 1 would be unfair.",3,137,271,1 July 2012
300," ugly clichés, tired imagery, no brain (very minor spoilers)
","<ul><li>minor spoilers regarding imagery mainly -</li></ul>This movie takes actual events and reduces them to the lowest level possible. The history of that time is actually interesting and complex as were the contesting sides. To say it was a lost opportunity is fairly irrelevant as they clearly had no intention of trying to use their resources to create an historical drama. They created a comic book which was likely what they wanted. What we get are a swirl of images and clichés. All of them are tired along with their symbolism. This is just formula. The skill is in the computer graphic people. The dialog, story, acting are virtually non-existent. All that can stay with you is in the tiring images that are pounded at you. Do the creative geniuses have nothing else to offer? Formula, clichés, tired symbols; The one dimension talking/shouting head characters, the black and white choices, the obligatory lesbian kiss, the quasi-rape, the quasi-orgy, the whacko jewelry, piercings, straps and thongs, the torches, the staircases, the earth-mother in the field of grain with the rising sun and her young son running to her, the treacherous hunchback, the blatantly scheming and treacherous politician, the treacherous priests, the one eyed messenger, the miscast ethnicities, the blazing light between columns (several times), the soldiers doing super-human movements, the disjointed battle sequences, the illogical battle tactics, the endless symbolic gestures, the killing of the messenger with the threatening message, etc.Then we get to the outright nonsense. The 'good' Spartans are given costumes that approximate reality but their opponents are faceless leftovers from Lord of the Rings. One swears they were dressing from the same closet, although a few did have robes that some Persians might have worn. Then we have the beardless, effeminate Xerxes with multiple piercings and gold speedo trunks, essentially a joke from bars and salons I try to avoid. This takes Hollywood's willingness to disrespect history to new heights. It's a new low standard that will be hard to beat.Even if you want blood, gore, action, fight scenes, what you get here is a video game of dark CGI. A comic book. But that is to insult comic books which often do have dialog, characters, depth, etc.",1,4,8,14 September 2007
