The Avengers," Decent fun
","Loki opens a portal to steal the tesseract right from under Fury's nose while converting two of Fury's sidekicks to his cause. He plans on opening a giant portal so that aliens can invade the earth and he can become the ruler over earthlings.Fury starts the Avenger initiative. Get all heroes, superheroes, semiheroes together to save the planet- even though his council doesn't agree entirely. So we get the scenes of these guys being recruited for the mission- as usual for heroes, against their will. There's Iron Man and the Hulk and their normal selves, some Russian agent chick, Captain America, and even Thor shows up.For more than an hour they fight amongst each other as is required of movie characters these days. But they do capture Loki in the process. Oddly he seems to want to be there. They realize he's up to something and the Russian chick is sent to find out what that is. It turns out to be rather underwhelming. Now Loki's people attack the flying aircraft carrier where everybody is. That forces these goofs to join forces and get serious.Loki escapes, opens the portal, aliens attack NY, the avengers respond and have to find a way to close the portal. But Fury wasn't entirely honest with them. He's up to something.Everything goes pretty much by the numbers. Loki is the star here by far. Of the heroes, Downey's character is the only somewhat memorable one. He manages to be a bit funny, cocky, but not too arrogant. Renner is pretty intense and interesting. Thor is likable. The other's don't do a whole lot. Jackson as always plays himself, or rather a caricature of himself. Why does he still get hired? The Avengers isn't as awesome as Thor nor as awful as Captain America. It's somewhere in between. Your standard summer blockbuster with serious CGI carnage a bit too reminiscent of some Transformers movie. We clearly don't need to see another movie with giant alien worms destroying skyscrapers, please. Whedon did his work and saved this from becoming some crappy Michael Bay clone. The script and dialog are alright. The whole idea just doesn't work all too well for me. All these ridiculous heroes-some human, others superhuman, others CGI, together. At least when it's all and said and done it's somewhat exhilarating but about 40 minutes too long. Intros are fine but we don't need that much of an intro let alone the obnoxious bickering amongst the main characters.",7,2,5,19 November 2012
Sucker Punch," 300 + The Matrix = emptiness
","One would imagine that a movie that combines the fantastic fight scenes of 300 with reality puzzles would make for an entertaining movie. It doesn't.The lovely Emily Browning, who doesn't look as lovely as a bleached blonde, plays a girl whose rich mother has died and left her wealth to her two daughters. The stepfather kills the younger girl and frames the older one. Not only that, but he gets her interned in an asylum and pays off the guy in charge to perform a lobotomy on her. Just as the needle is about to hit her eye, we enter into the second level of reality. Here the ill girls are strippers and prostitutes. Emily's Baby Doll bonds with the other girls. Every time she dances she enters a third level of reality. Here she is guided by a guru and given hints on how to escape. They have to collect some items from level 2 in order to get out. While she dances she hypnotizes the audience while the other girls steal the objects needed. The missions in level 3 take the shape of video game like battles. As with video games, the enemies are the Germans, monsters, and alien robots. These battle scenes are pretty good but progressively get worse. The first one is the most amazing, looking like a battle from Call of Duty II. The second one in the middle ages is OK. The third one against robots that look like they came from I-Robot is poor.Eventually it all has to unravel through the 3 levels of reality. Everything that happens is really an excuse to show us battle scenes. The whole stripper stuff is silly in a PG-13 movie and looks more like some cheesy burlesque music video- and we actually get one of those as the end credits roll.There is a message in this movie, not unlike the one from The Matrix: free yourself and you are responsible for your destiny. A noble message no doubt. However, the movie doesn't play out the message. The ending us unhappy. It takes courage for filmmakers to go with an unhappy ending. But here it doesn't work with the positive message the movie tries to impart. How can you free yourself when you're lobotomized (the main actress does get lobotomized in the end)? What is the purpose of taking charge of your life if someone else benefits from your actions and not you (another character and not the main one escapes from the institution).There is an idea here, there is the budget, and skill of the crew and cast, in particular Browning, Cornish, Gugino. But if the aim is ultimately to film somewhat cool fight scenes your movie is destined to fail as does this one.",5,1,4,13 May 2011
10 Cloverfield Lane," It's OK, nothing special
","A girl leaves her boyfriend. Of course her sorry boyfriend begs her to come back. It's night on the road as she drives. Suddenly she crashes. She then wakes up with an IV and brace on her knee. The brace is chained to a wall. She freaks out. She's a in a room with some heavy duty steel door. A stranger comes in and offers food. He claims to have saved her, that something is going on outside and that they are save in his underground shelter. He leaves her the key so she can free herself and some crutches. She sharpens the end of the crutch and attacks the guy next time he walks in, but he defends himself and complains bitterly how she treats her even though he saved her life.She hears some cars above, there's a scuffle. Once she becomes more compliant the guy, Howard, let's her out of the room and introduces her to Emmett who's got a broken arm, result of the scuffle with Howard when he somehow forced his way into the shelter. Little by little they get used to each other while always maintaining suspicion. No one knows what really happened outside. For some reason they have no radio, not sure if that would work in the situation, but they have no clue. Michelle continues to think she's held captive until someone screams and knocks on the entrance begging to be let in. Her face is burned. Michelle is dumb enough to actually try and let this woman in but the woman apparently dies.Michelle is a fashion designer and at some point decides to make a home-made hazmat suit and gas mask with the help of Emmett. But Howard is also suspicious of these two and knows they are up to something. Emmett doesn't fare well in the ensuing confrontation. In the end Michelle barely makes it out and we learn what is really going on.10 Cloverfield Lane is a bigger budget minimalist thriller. It's very risky to confine the audience with the few characters in a small space for most of a movie. Usually it turns into an obnoxious movie with a bunch of losers screaming at each other for two hours. This movie fortunately avoids that mistake. Yes, you're stuck with these three for nearly two hours and they sort of try to get along. Howard is a pia. But it makes for some tension, you never know when he is going to flip out or when the other two are going to to something stupid.It's strange that the filmmakers decided to try and build suspense around the question of what it going on in the outside world, when the title of the movie somehow explains it. I haven't seen the first movie but I know what it is about. Hollywood continues to insist on the role-reversal business for who knows what reason. Michelle is both the brains and the brawl. Emmett is the dumb, useless damsel in distress and the other male is the villain. Also annoying was the beginning of this movie which takes place on mute, no dialogue, nor sound effects just lame orchestrated music and this goes on for a while. I almost gave up on this movie after that. The ending too is just a bit too far-fetched, even for a movie a like this. 10 Cloverfield Lane achieves more or less what it sets out to do, but in the end it is a film with low aspirations.",6,1,3,28 June 2016
The Equalizer," Decent but formulaic action
","Washington plays McCall, a guy who works at a home improvement store. At night he goes to a diner and ritualistically drinks tea while reading a book. Also at the diner every night is a young Russian prostitute who waits there to be picked up by her rich clients. They occasionally chat about the books he's reading. His wife started a project to read a list of 100 books but she died before she could complete it. Now he's repeating the project. One night, the girl is bruised. They walk together and her pimp shows up and slaps her around some more. Another night the girl doesn't show up at the diner. McCall finds out she got a beating and is hospitalized. He goes to the hospital and talks to one of the girl's colleagues who tells him how the girls are treated and that they are risking their lives.McCall decides to visit the pimp and after a whole lot of nothing finally explodes and kills all the mobsters there, pretty much single-handedly, that is, often with just one hand. That gets the attention of the main Russian mobster who sends a cleaner named Teddy to take care of things. Teddy is well-mannered, well-dressed, soft-spoken but vicious. After much investigation he finds out that McCall was behind the killings and starts tracking him and even pays him a visit.McCall, still living his slow life, thinks about things, he visits a woman who's some higher up in government. She tells him it's OK if he does what he has to do. Now McCall decides to act. He goes after corrupt cops on the mobster's payroll, destroys their entire operation, and meets Terry leading to the eventual final confrontation in the dark and with water sprinklers on of course, when Teddy decides to take McCalls's coworkers hostage.I'm not familiar with the TV series but this movie is a fairly average and formulaic action movie. You have the reluctant hero with near superpowers, who is forced to make justice when put in a corner. Personally, I don't think Washington makes that convincing of an action hero. He's empathetic enough so I see him taking on the standard Morgan Freeman role at some point. The story is very good though, even though things go pretty much as expected. The movie is about 30-40 minutes too long. For a movie that focuses so much on its lead, we learn next to nothing about McCall. And as much as this director, and others, do their best to glorify Washington--one just has to count the number of slow-motion shots of Washington--it's Marton Csokas who steals the show as the calm and brutal Teddy. The movie also ends on a laughable and improbable situation as McCall travels to Moscow. But I'm in favor of movies who advocate the reading of books, so I'll give it one more point for that.",7,4,7,18 January 2015
The Expendables 2," Could be so much better
","As soon as the movie starts, we are introduced to the action as the Expendables rescue Trench and some other guy. Back at home, Ross is approached by Church for one final mission, a mission that will even things out between them. They are to collect a drive from a crashed airplane somewhere in Eastern Europe. Along for the ride is some little Chinese computer expert girl who claims to be proficient in fighting. They extract the device but are immediately confronted with a gang of bad guys led by Van Damme's Villain who take the device which has the exact location of plutonium. As a result the newest and youngest recruit will sacrifice his life. Villain starts extracting the plutonium using as slaves all the male population of nearby towns.Ross decides to stop Villain but he's undermanned and underpowered until Church, Trent, and even Chuck Norris appear. 'Who's next, Rambo?' Wisecracks Schwarzenegger in one of the funniest lines.Expendables 2 follows the formula of part 1: lots of shooting and some fights, an even bigger and better cast, and all in rather understated fashion. And that is its weakness. With such a cast, they should have gone for glamour and glory. Both movies suffer from lack of self-esteem due to Stallone's humbleness. While Lundgren steals the show in part 1, in this one he doesn't get to do much. It's as if the story and camera avoids him as to not give him a chance to steal the show again. It's Schwarzenegger who gets all the funny lines. But Van Damme shines as the bad guy. And he's still in shape and can deliver some great kicks. Li and Couture have minor roles. Stallone and Crews are infinitely likable. Adkins is somewhat of a revelation. It was a mistake no to cast Gina Carano as the girl like production had intended to initially. The shootings are much more bloody, reminiscent of Rambo IV with blood squirting and shooting out in by the gallons. Statham gets most of the action screen time but the fights are disappointing and underwhelming, limiting himself to throwing knives.The large scale action is filmed OK, but some of the smaller scale fights aren't convincing. Despite all that, this movie is mild and gentle, so to speak. This movie is good, but it could have been so much better. I'm also nostalgic about the 80s but this movie could have benefited from a more updated direction. Simon West, unlike what the entire cast says, is just the wrong guy to direct this movie. I can think of countless directors who would have done a much better job. At least the cinematography is nice. Everything is bright and clear and there are no gimmicks and cheesy CGI.There so much potential with this franchise. I just hope for part 3 they pick a more assertive style, a better director and go for more modern action. Given how self-conscious these movies are, Joss Whedon would be ideal for directing it and enriching the script. Boaz Yakin wouldn't be a bad choice either. If they want to go with someone who could bring a fresh vision, Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. or Morten Tyldum would be good.",7,3,4,7 December 2012
Skyfall," Bond in times of recession- no fun.
","In the intro scene we see Bond following some guy. He's got some girl sidekick helping him. Both have comms to MI6 and M keeps telling them to get the guy or else they lose the list. That leads to some ludicrous motorcycle chase scene on Turkish rooftops followed by a chase and fight to top of a moving train. The girl positions herself to shoot the bad guy but Bond keeps getting himself in the crosshairs too. M orders the shot, Bond is hit and falls a couple hundred yards down a cliff and into the water.In Act II, M attends a very public funeral for the fallen secret agent 007, when MI6 HQ blows up. Retired/vacationing Bond hears the news and returns to England to offer his services. He's in bad shape and doesn't pass the requirement tests to go back to work. Nevertheless, M who's about to forcefully retire assigns him to investigate and get back the list of all NATO secret agents embedded with terrorists.Act III takes us to China where Bond follows the bad guy from the intro who from one highrise shoots someone in another highrise. In the fight with Bond he ends up falling down the building and Bond finds a casino chip that leads him to Macau where he cashes it in for a lot of money. There he meets a gorgeous girl (Marlohe) enslaved by the big bad guy, Silva. She offers to take him to meet Silva, but first Bond has to survive some thugs. Bond ends up meeting Silva on some deserted Chinese island. He's a former 00 agent played wickedly by Bardem, who as a sign of our times also fondles Bond who takes it with a smile. Choppers arrive and take both back to London.There he's jailed in some glass cage. A new Q studies Silva's computer only to have his entire system infected and hijacked. Silva escapes and goes after M but his mission to kill her fails. Bond and M set a trap for him offering M as bait.That takes us to the final act in the Bond family ranch in Scotland and a somewhat unexpected ending.Bond movies always have been a good mirror of the times. But it's not easy figuring out what this one, and Quantum of Solace say about our times. Both movies present us a Bond in times of recession and cost-cutting. Politicians during hearings to punish M question the whole purpose of MI6 and secret agents. There are no gadgets at all in this movie. There is no glamor. While we do get one casino scene, there's no gambling involved, just fighting as the Bond movies continue their descent into Bourne territory, except that Bourne movies excel at what they are. The locations are rather unspectacular. We have seen Turkish rooftops a few times too many recently and fighting on top of moving trains, well, that's been going in since westerns. The intro scene looks like something out of some silly Michael Bay movie with cars flying around. And I don't mean that as a compliment. The intro credits are lame. They manage to show just 1 or 2 girls. In general, the girls in the this movie aren't really Bond girls the way we know them. Poor Marlohe gets a a very thankless role. And they did something with her teeth to ruin her otherwise stunning smile, the lousy make up doesn't help either.For some reason this movie is more about M than anything else. Frankly though, who cares about her? It's also more introspective and subjective. It's less about the mission than about the audience learning about Bond's past and Bond learning about himself, or some such thing. It just isn't handled well in this movie. The revelations about M's ruthlessness should have been handled as such, as surprises. Perhaps then we could care more. Personally I'm not all that interested in Bond's background. Again, if it were handled better in a more cursory way it would be more meaningful instead of tying to make it of supreme importance when there is really not a whole to it.The significance of the title says it all. One hears 'Skyfall' and thinks of some sophisticated villain trying to take down planets. Instead it's the name of the Bond family ranch... That's more or less how this entire movie works- very underwhelming. It's a back to basics movie, very limited in scope and ambition with a flawed direction and lots of plot holes. It's a Bond for a new generation, a generation that has never seen the greatness of previous Bond movies. In the past, Bond movies were in a league of their own. This new Bond sets standards fairly low and now has to compete with Bourne and that kind of movies. And now it even has to compete with excellent TV series like Strike Back that have more of a Bond spirit than Skyfall. Skyfall is stunningly unspectacular and not a whole lot of fun.",5,7,16,24 February 2013
Deja Vu," Thrilling and ingenious
","After someone blows up a ferry filled with military personnel and their families all law enforcement agencies are going bonkers. ATF agent Carlin gets a call about a burnt body of a woman washing ashore. Except that this happened before the attack. Carlin falls in love with the dead woman, Claire. He's then invited to join a special FBI task force that utilizes cutting edge tech to render images from satellites and cameras everywhere in the area, but from events that happened several days ago. They don't know where to start, so Carlin suggests they look at Claire. Sure enough, she's selling her old SUV and gets a call from the perpetrator. Carlin's partner who is supposed to be on vacation actually died on scene as well. Claire has some strange reactions so Carlin has his doubts about the technology the FBI is using and sure enough there's an exciting twist about how the FBI can access the info from the past. It also has some portable device which allows them to expand their radius, which involves Carin having to drive to places after the bad guy in the past to see what else he did. Here we learn that his partner actually went after the bad guy thanks to a mysterious tip and how the Claire ended up dead. I missed Deja Vu when it came out so I was quite surprised by this movie watching it years later. The beginning was pretty bad though, it looked like something out of those ridiculous Michael Bay movies. Washington is also a problem as he often struggles with knowing when to get serious and when to act like a goof. But it's the story here that shines and how it combines police work with science and science fiction to come up with something surprising and that requires your full attention to little details. It's also is one of those movies that does explain itself and everything that happens. I could have done without the politics and without the happy ending which wasn't suited to the movie and completely unnecessary. Otherwise, Deja Vu is an outstanding movie.",9,0,0,14 October 2018
It," A disaster
","Some loser pre-teen kids start being chased by something that confronts them with their fears. Occasionally some downright stupid-looking clown shows up. More terrifying than visions and clowns though is pretty much everyone else--the teen bullies and the parents that give the kids a hard time. There's the backstory of the town where kids disappear every so often. The kids are given something of a personality. It takes the kids more than two hours to figure things out and to confront the fugly but not scary clown. The editor and director struggle mightily with this underwhelming material and ultimately fail miserably in making something remotely interesting or thrilling out of it. The concept from the beginning is doomed. A movie about kids, written as if it were for kids yet actually for adults as is fashionable now, yet R rated for no good reason really with no scares or nothing else R-rated and clocking in at more than to tortuous hours. Unfortunately producing junk paid off this time around for everyone involved and we can look forward to a bunch of sequels that promise to be no better than this embarrassment in any way whatsoever. There's one thing this mess has going for it and for that I give it two stars and that is the stunning Sophia Lillis.",2,0,1,10 January 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A bit too ambitious, but it works.
","As a young boy Lincoln witnesses how his mother is attacked by a vampire. Since then he dreams of nothing but killing that vampire. As a young man, he is taken under the wing and trained by a vampire hunter, who gives him assignments to kill all these vampires- except the one Lincoln wants to kill. Also in the area is the main vampire. In the meantime Lincoln studies law, becomes involved in politics, wins the presidency, and the civil war begins. The main vampire is a big fan of slavery because it gives him plenty of bodies. So the civil war will turn out to be the north against the vampires in the south. The main vampire also manages to attack Lincoln's son. As these vampires can only be killed with a silver bullet, Lincoln has to to gather all the silver he can get to provide the army with enough bullets to destroy all the vampires, but he first has to transport all that silver to the battlefront.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is surprisingly an entertaining action flick. I wasn't expecting much but ended up enjoying it. You can't expect much in terms of character development but Lincoln's vampire friend is somewhat of an interesting character. The fight sequences are pretty well filmed. The larger and more complex CGI scenes don't convince, they look pretty cheesy but I didn't mind. The final fight on top of a moving train, at night, surrounded by fire is too cliché. This movie tries to cover a lot in terms of the life of Lincold a bit too much perhaps, but it is nevertheless an entertaining movie that is rather mild for it's R-rating.",7,0,0,8 January 2013
John Wick," Great action
","A car crashes against a wall. A seriously injured guy tumbles out. He starts watching a video of him with a woman.That takes us to the beginning in cut scenes. The guy was celebrating his anniversary with the woman who is ill. That night she collapses and dies in the hospital. The guy is devastated. Later he gets a delivery. It's a puppy. The woman arranged it to be sent to him once she dies, so he doesn't have to mourn alone.Next morning he goes for a drive in his classic Mustang with the puppy. At a gas station some Russian offers to buy the car. The guy refuses. The Russian doesn't take it too well. At night a bunch of masked guys break into the guy's house, kill the puppy, beat him up and steal the car. They take the car to a shop where the owner is outraged at the stupidity of the Russian. He known who the car belongs to. Then he gets a call from the Russian's father who's the big mobster. The shop owner tells him the son just stole John Wick's car.Now we learn from the mobster about John. He was the baddest unstoppable killing machine around till he retired when he met his wife. So he knows what's coming. His son doesn't get it and thinks he can do something about it. He sends an army to visit John at night. John dispatches them all and calls a specialized cleaning crew afterward. Now John unearths his gear, puts on a nice suit and checks into the Continental hotel--a safe house for hit men. There everyone thinks that John is back in business. He clarifies that it's just personal. The mobster puts a bounty on his head and that means that all the bad guys in town will go after him, including some at the safe house--which goes against the rules.John now goes after the son and eventually after the mobster father and later we return to the beginning.The trailer promised exhilarating action and the movie delivers. It's old-fashioned pistol action and athletic fisticuffs. If the title Bullet for the Head weren't taken it could have made an apt title for this movie as well, as John isn't just happy to empty a clip into some bad guy but has to finish things off by blowing their skulls open. It's R-rated action as it should be. When bloody action if filmed for PG-13 standards you end up with duds like the Taken sequels. It also has some original car action, not so much chases but cars used for shootouts. Cool stuff. Perhaps it goes a bit overboard in manipulating your emotions. It's not enough that the wife dies and that he's heart-broken, but they've got to kill the puppy and steal the cool car. But it was expected as dogs always end up dead in Hollywood movies. But while he's alive, the dog character and actor really do a solid job. The whole Russians as bad guys is getting a bit tired. Is it that hard to do something original in Hollywood?What is particularly interesting is the whole underground hit men culture. The safehouse/hotel, the rules, the cleaning crew and so on. Reeves is always likable even when all he does is shoot at people. But this movie has another thing going for it and that is Michael Nyqvist who is incapable of not giving a spectacular performance. You can just tell he gets a kick out of every role he plays. Looking forward to part 2.",9,4,10,16 February 2015
Gravity," Grossly overrated
","Bullock plays herself in space as some computer tech repairing some satellite on a space shuttle. Mission commander is Clooney playing himself as well. They get a notice from mission command on earth that a satellite has blown up sending debris their way and that all satellites are being hit and eventually they'll lose communication. Clooney orders Bullock to finish up, but she thinks she knows better and keeps tinkering with a computer board. And indeed they end up hit with debris. Bullock ends up tumbling out of control detached from the arm that was holding her to the shuttle. As she goes flying out of control she loses communication with everyone.When all hope seems lost. Clooney appears and grabs her. With his jet pack they go back to the shuttle and discover it's destroyed and some other guy part of the mission is dead. They make their way to the nearby international space station that has a released parachute with hundreds of belts entangled. Clooney realizes that for them to make it, he will have to let go.Bullock arrives at the station, but there's a fire in one of the sections which quickly expands everywhere else. She escapes in a pod to the nearby Chinese space station. There she has one more chance to escape in a pod to earth. But as earlier as well, oxygen becomes an issue, plus she isn't exactly at flying these craft.Gravity is a pretty looking movie. And how could it be otherwise. These days the least you can do with a space movie is show cool sights. A bit of annoyance is the constantly rotating and floating camera.The story itself is surprisingly simple and empty. Our main character finds herself in an emergency and everything that could go wrong does go wrong and then some. The writers aren't a bit shy about exaggerating things and/or forgetting about realism when it suits them. Twice in the movie, oxygen becomes a problem, but it's also quickly forgotten when it's not convenient to the filmmakers.Performances are very weak. You can accept Bullock in a many roles--an astronaut computer expert isn't one of them. Same with Clooney. At the same time, Bullock (and Clooney for that matter) is likable enough that you can watch her scream and groan through this movie.Gravity looks good and Bullock makes a rather slim story watchable. But Gravity is a neither a great nor good movie and certainly not an worthy award winner.",4,2,7,3 March 2014
Train to Busan," Not that good
","A farmer is stopped at some decontamination checkpoint. There's some leak at a biotech plant.Next we meet the boss of some investment firm. He's of course too busy to pay attention to his young daughter who wants to visit her mom in Busan. The dad finally agrees and they make it to the train station. On they way there's something going on, lots of emergency vehicles are driving somewhere. As the train departs zombies attack the train station and one actually makes it on the train.This zombie attacks some train attendant who bites another one and so on. Here the transformation into a zombie is near instantaneous. Depending on the needs of the script it may happen right away or it may take a minute or two. When eventually the passengers catch on what is going on, they run to the front of the train while the zombies end up in the rear. But by now the condition is spreading all over South Korea. The train isn't allowed to stop somewhere, communications are interrupted.We meet several characters: a pregnant woman and her tougher husband, two older women, a young baseball team, an even more arrogant and selfish business guy, and the train conductor.They do stop in some town where people would be quarantined by the military. But when they arrive and leave the train the military personnel is also infected. So it's back on the train but this time a group is in the back another in the rear. The ones in the back--our heroes--have to make it to the front where people are so freaked out they won't let them in.Things get grimmer and we'll have to see who actually survives this disaster as they get closer and closer to Busan.Train to Busan is a long, slow, melodramatic thriller with zombies piled up--I guess that's going to be the new trend thanks to World War Z, piles and piles of quick zombies. Despite the penchant for drama there's little dialogue and the characters' behavior often doesn't make a whole lot of sense mainly because for some reason they have nothing to say to each other. The zombie action is quick, somewhat unclear, individual zombies matter little but masses of zombies falling out of train cars like cockroaches are emphasized. None of it is particularly scary or frightening, which it should be given that the humans in a train have only two places to go- to the front or to the back. There's not a whole lot of gore or violence. What is good though is the setting of a zombie movie in a train; and I also liked that the movie takes place mostly during the day.It's surprising that while this movie does point out the soullessness of business people it also makes one of them the hero. We do get some sense of Korean values--rigidity, deference to authority, overemphasis on education as a solution to all ills.I can't quite understand the high score of this movie. It is perfectly mediocre and stands out in no way whatsoever.",5,1,10,15 August 2017
World War Z," A few good ideas, lots of bad ones.
","Pitt plays some former UN employee who on a regular morning leaves with his family. But as they're driving through the city, something is wrong. People start running, cars start crashing and Pitt distinguished some people attacking others who then start contorting violently only to end up attacking others.Pitt I guess is still so revered at the UN that they send a helicopter the next day to rescue him and his family. But first he has to survive the night. They are taken to some aircraft carrier where the military is running things, while the President has been attacked. The UN wants something from him. It's still not clear what he did at the UN but he's the only one who can take on this mission. The mission is to guide a scientist to discover the origin of the zombie disease. He and the scientist and a special ops team fly to Korea because that's where the first mention of 'zombie' came from.In Korea, the scientist suffers a surprising and neat fate, not before giving an interesting speech on how mother nature works. They learn from a US base military team that a prisoner was ill and attacked his doctor and then military guys. Pitt finds out that the israelis apparently had advanced notice of the outbreak because they finished building a wall surrounding their country just in time and thus are not affected.So off Pitt goes to Israel where he meets an agent who gives him a fascinating insight into Israeli strategic thinking and tells him that they heard for the first time of the undead from a communication coming from India. But by then some sporadic dancing and singing attracts the zombies who climb over the giant wall and attack almost everyone. While Pitt tries to make it to the airport to travel to India, he adopts some little soldier girl who got bitten and he realizes that his pilot flew away so to they stop a plane on the runway and climb in.A zombie hiding in the restroom is freed and soon enough we have zombies on a plane, so Pitt does the next logical thing- explode a grenade midflight. The plane crashes conveniently close to Pitts new destination near a WHO research facility. Of course only Pitt, the girl and a zombie survive. At the facility Pitt experiments with the solution he has come up with.Not sure what the title World War Z refers to as there is no war. While we don't get a story of the origin of the disease,we get a very interesting solution to the problem. The movie starts out pretty good, but soon enough goes on mute as no one has anything interesting anymore to say. The zombies are the usual--for these days-- quick running zombies. In fact they act like little Hulks ambushing people sideways and toppling them like bowling pins. The effects are fairly cartoonish, too. There is a single scare, but it's a good one that had the entire theater crowd jumping. The movie is 30 minutes too long wasting too much time on Pitt's family- something no one cares about. The ideas here are smart, but the script at times is very dumb.",7,2,4,19 August 2013
Passengers," Long, slow romance with cool sci-fi bits
","In the future some spaceship owned by a corporation is transporting thousands of people in hibernation to a colony planet. Even though it has some fancy shield to protect it during a meteor shower it is hit by a large meteor. The ship can also fix itself, which it does, but there some one item left it can't fix. Suddenly one guy named Jim is awoken from hibernation. There is no else awake not even crew. The whole ship is automated, the AIs are of no help. There are plenty of little robots cleaning things. Jim sends a message to headquarters which is going to take several decades to arrive. He learns that they are 90 years away from their destination and he cannot put himself into hibernation. For some reason Jim desperately tries to break in the cockpit but to no avail. He makes use of the facilities on the ship which include everything someone could want. Except that it's arranged by social classes. He's a mechanic so he's lower class and gets a small cabin and lousy food. But the spacewalks are fun. One day he discovers an open bar and a bartender, but it's a robot as well. But at least he can have conversations with it. After a year he goes looking at the hibernation pods and finds a pretty girl. It occurs to him to maybe wake her up. But he's undecided and chats with the robot/bartender named Arthur about it.Then one day he decides to wake the girl up pretending it's another ship malfunction. She's pretty antisocial and doesn't care much about him. She too tries to break into the cockpit for no good reason after getting frustrated with the unhelpful AI. But she's upper class so she has access to better food/facilities. Little by little she warms up to Jim and they go on dates and try to have fun. On the day he wants to give her a ring, Arthur decides to spill the beans and tell the girl that Jim woke her on purpose. She flips out of course realizing that it's a death sentence and basically wants nothing to do with him.Over time things start to malfunction aboard the ship, starting with the little cleaning robots. Then suddenly Jim and the girl run into another guy, he's the captain. Now things on the ship start breaking down real fast. The captain, too, is sick. The healing pods can do nothing for him; he's got massive multi-organ failure and has a few hours to live. In the last couple of seconds he tells them that they have to find out what is wrong with the ship and fix it.Somehow they quickly realize it's something near the fusion core and sure enough the meteorite broke through the walls. Things now are seriously overheating and the venting system isn't working so Jim realizes he has to do a spacewalk outside to fix the vent doors while the girl pulls the handle to vent the core. Of course things don't go smoothly and we learn whether they manage to save the ship and all people on board.I'm telling it as if it were an action sci-fi film, but Passengers isn't. The focus here is the on/off romance and drama between the two. The romance is alright I guess. Not sure if people who like romance are annoyed as much by the bits of action as much as action people are by the romance. The setting was ideal for horror action sci-fi instead of romance and drama. The premise is pretty good, of course nothing new. The visuals too are cool, both the bits of cosmos and the fancy modern interior design of the spaceship. The problem for me was the excessive length of the movie and that during most of it, nothing is really at stake. No effort is made to get us to care about the fate of the 5000 passengers. The rest is pretty predictable, so it's not like the movie surprises at any point. Not sure why Tyldum got involved in this. There's nothing in the script that is remotely interesting or that has potential for a director to leave his mark. If anything it's Pratt who makes this dull movie work.",4,0,2,12 January 2020
The Hunger Games," Great story, good movie.
","I haven't read the book so I can't compare the two. One would imagine that since the author was involved in production, the movie is to some extent an accurate rendition of the author's intent. The story is well known so I won't summarize it here. There are two parts to this movie, the events prior to the actual hunger games and the hunger games themselves. In the preparatory part we get to know about the world this takes place in and a tiny bit about our characters.The world of The Hunger Games is emphatically separated into two classes- the working class and the wealthy class. The working class has nothing and lives in a colorless misery comparable to those living during the Great Depression. The wealthy are a colorful, depraved and repugnant bunch and look like something out of a Mozart musical combined with a gay parade. They don't seem to do anything other than revel in opulence. A whole lot is made in speech about training the candidates and about them gaining sponsors although for the purposes of the movie and the hunger games all this doesn't really amount to much in the end. Our heroine, Katniss is your typical Hollwood powergrl- like a CEO wanna-be with rabies. She treats everyone around her like dirt and we are suppose to admire her for it.Fortunately during the hunger game, Katniss becomes human and develops weaknesses, fear, and a heart. We learn almost nothing about the other participants/districts. One of them seems to house plenty of black people, and their candidates are also the good guys of course. The bad guys are the kids who represent some Sparta-type district that actually prepares their children for this monstrosity. They of course are the blonde blue-eyed devils. Fortunately we don't get to see a whole lot of child-on-child violence except earlier when a video of the games of the previous year is shown. The 'games' themselves are terribly unfair by virtue of the random choosing of the kids. As a result you have adolescents fighting against children.Performances are overall good in this movie. Stanley Tucci stands out the ludicrous fake TV host of the games' broadcast. His fake ultrawhite over-sized teeth, his nasty laugh, his colored hair that's not fake black-blue but blue blue, is a delightful mockery of the fakeness of the media and its worms with their larger than life personalities.But the star of this movie is the story and how it maximizes social injustice to clarify it to audiences who probably don't understand that it exists. The vile and depraved upper class with its garish taste is not too far from what they look and act like in their gated conclaves. It's not enough that they have it all and that the workers and producers have nothing, they have to humiliate and debase them every year with this absurd ritual that sacrifices 23 children to discourage any future uprisings that could threaten the unjust status quo. There is some romance as well, which is tasteful, and well done and given Katniss' caricaturesque action heroine attitude, downright welcome. We also learn something about the thinking of those pulling the strings of the world. They don't want to offer much to those who have nothing, but a little bit of hope, but not too much. Direction is pretty good, but they could have cut some scenes short, and I'm sure there more background story, perhaps we'll learn about it in the sequels. It's good to see a movie aimed at young people that isn't entirely stupefying.",7,0,3,20 August 2012
Argo," Thrilling, at times in spite of itself.
","Embassy staff at the US embassy in Tehran in 1979 are minding their own business when a student march arrives at their door. Things get more and more difficult as it turns into a protest with protesters climbing the walls, eventually they make it inside while the staff frenetically tries to destroy documents. Some who are at the public's entrance decide to escape the embassy while the rest are held hostage. These six make it to the residence of the Canadian ambassador and stay there.This of course becomes the Iran hostage crisis. But the focus of Argo isn't on that, but on the 6 held up at the Canadian residence. It gets to the point where they are putting at risk the Canadians who themselves have asked the US to do something.Back in the US, CIA and State mull over scenarios to get them out. One idea is to have them ride a bike during the winter to Turkey disguised as agricultural experts. But eventually the CIA's exfiltration expert, Tony, comes up with the idea to pretend to film a movie in Iran and the 6 are part of the crew. He has to make it look real so he travels to Hollywood, finds a sci-fi script, gets in touch with a friendly make-up artists who connects him with a producer who will produce the fake movie. Argo is the title of the script they settle on. They do casting calls and script reading and get stories published in industry magazines.With that Tony travels to Iran, gets in touch with an agent and deals with the culture ministry and so on. The 6 of course don't like the idea of having to risk their lives for freedom. Eventually of course they agree. Things get risky when they do location scouting pretending to be a film crew in a busy bazaar.Meanwhile in the US, State decides to shut the operation down, but Tony doesn't see any other way out than continuing the operation just as the Iranians are about to storm the Canadian residence.Argo does work surprisingly. Surprisingly because it doesn't have much of a lead or main characters. Tony is silent and laid back. We know almost nothing about the 6 and only see them when they start complaining about Tony's plan. Of course when the movie focuses on Hollywood it becomes enthusiastic and our producer who's been around the block a couple of times knows how rotten the business is. Those scenes provide some comic relief.It's the story here the carries the movie. It slowly creates suspense despite some obvious exaggerations and unrealistic scenes designed to keep you on the edge of your seat. Will Tony and the 6 make it to the plane? Will the Iranians, who are already on the alert, discover the ruse? Argo does an excellent job with the setting of the 70s with its documentary tone. That makes it all fairly realistic since much is based on actual footage of the time. Argo is an exciting and entertaining movie if you set aside some of the minor flaws. It's not quite a best movie of the year, but Hollywood loves nothing more than to glorify itself and make its absurd line of work appear heroic.",8,0,1,18 June 2013
Green Room," Decent thriller that doesn't reach its potential
","A broke punk band travels in its van across the country to meet with some promoter who will interview them and set them up with a gig. They think he's legit but of course things don't pan out and they end up playing at a Mexican restaurant for a few bucks. But he offers to make it up to them. He calls a cousin of his and he schedules them for a gig at a skinhead event. Why punks would play at skinhead event? Who knows. But the agree and off they go to some place out in the woods.One of them comes up with a very punk idea--to start the gig with an anti-Nazi song. Of course it's not appreciated by the skinheads. But the rest of their set is appreciated by the audience. As our band is about to leave, one of them realizes she left her phone in the green room. Another guy offers to pick it up. As he opens the door, he finds a bunch of skinheads and dead girl on the floor with a knife somehow stuck in her skull.He tries to leave but obviously now no one is leaving. He barely manages to call 911. They are rushed into the green room with a big skinhead guarding them and a girl skinhead friend of the dead one. What follows is a long back and forth negotiation. We meet a couple of skinheads--their leader, a guy in charge of the dogs, one in charge of the music. The leader decides to call 911, he gets some young skinheads to stab themselves for the arriving cops. Now the cops are gone. Our punks were just waiting for the cops the resolve the situation. Now they are back to negotiating with the skinheads.Eventually some violence erupts which forces the punks or what's left of them to return again and again to the green room to strategize how to escape and get revenge.Green Room threatens to be yet another minimalist low budget thriller of a group of people stuck in a room screaming at each other for hours. Fortunately, it manages to transcend that formula and give us a bit more. Just not enough though. The punks are for the most part not very relevant. And actually most of them aren't even committed punks, only one of them is. The skinheads too aren't particularly well defined. As others have mentioned, audio recording is terrible. While the punks aren't particularly interesting, the skinhead leadership actually is interesting but you can't understand most of what they say.While there are some thrills in this movie, there aren't enough given the setting. This movie should have been much stronger. But it would have required better characters, more settings, and more action. Green Room is overly restrained. You expect all hell to break loose at any moment, a moment that never comes. That creates some tension no doubt but it doesn't last. But they did get something very right, and that is the music. Most movies that have metal/extreme music has a theme fail miserably in that area. Green Room doesn't. You just wish it would have gotten the rest as right.",6,1,8,10 May 2016
The Babadook," Don't believe the hype
","A woman is involved in a crash. It's a nightmare based on something that happens years ago. On their way to the hospital to give birth her husband dies in a car crash. Years later we meet her again and the her now young son. She works at a convalescent hospital and hasn't gotten over her husband's death. The kid plays games about being a magician and also builds weapons and runs around saying he will protect the mother. But he's also problematic. He gets in trouble at school, with neighbors, family. He looks creepy and drives the mother crazy but in good modern fashion she barely dares raise her voice, let alone give him a good and deserved beating. She takes him out of school, and some child services people arrive. Finally she takes him to a psychiatrists and gets some tranquilizers for him and her.At some point the kid finds a creepy pop-up book called 'Mr. Babadook' about some creepy guy dressed in black with lots of teeth who wants to be let in the house and warns of killing people. She hides the book but it appears again. The kid becomes obsessed with it seeing Babadook everywhere. The next time she reads it, it now presents a woman who kills her dog, a child, and herself. She, too, has a dog, and as all dogs in movies, it doesn't end well. This new story will become somewhat prophetic as the babadook does enter into her body. The kid will get to enact his fantasies of protector of the mother.On the face of it, The Babadook is lame psychological thriller that's frustrating and infuriating. Who wants to see bad miserable parents and their obnoxious kids? So you end up rooting for babadook to kill these two in gruesome ways. And that's a problem for any movie, if your two main and almost only characters aren't particularly likable. This movie is not scary in spite of what some odd reviews claim. The babadook doesn't really show up all that much. His voice though is pretty creepy.We are led to believe then that there is some very deep meaning to this movie, and there are plenty of interpretation on IMDb. If anything perhaps, this is about the repressed desire mothers have to kill their annoying son, who knows. I don't think this movie aims to lead us to one single interpretation. The problem is that I couldn't care less whether this movie has the deepest religious symbolism or presents some radical political criticism. I didn't care for the characters, nor for the story; I didn't connect. I imagine that single mothers will enjoy this movie, or parents with problematic kids, or folks who feel like their life is driving them crazy.The question I wonder about is whether this director is a good director or not. On the one hand, the story should have lent itself to a better, scarier movie. On the other hand, with few characters and a pretty basic story the director managed to make more out of what she really had. The Babadook enforced my belief that it is extremely difficult to make a good movie about madness, perhaps even impossible.",5,18,36,19 November 2015
Silent Hill," One of the worst movies ever made.
","One of the worst movies ever. It nearly put me to sleep, long, boring, constant pointless running through hall ways. And frankly, who cared about any of the characters. We're getting to the point were these movie-makers are going to go back to mute films because they don't want to have any dialogue, just fancy visuals. Granted, there were two scenes that caught my attention. one with some creature behind the main character and the camera slowly pulls down revealing this creature. This scene was partially shown on TV trailers. The other the scene with the F117-head guy with the giant knife. That looked very videogamish but interesting. These are just visual curiousities. There was no interesting story, no interesting characters. As usual, after boring us to death with 2 hours of fancy computer effects, during the last 10 minutes they try to cram the entire story and have it all unravel and make sense. by then I just don't care anymore. You can't have 10 minutes make up for two hours on nonsense. I'm sickened by Hollywood anti-male sexism. I don't want to see anymore all-girl-superhero movies. That's a bunch of BS. If they want to keep their girl-power campaign up, fine. Just don't expect me to fork over 9 bucks for their twisted political agenda. And this movie represented the worse of that with male characters added only because studio execs rightfully and courageously protested. he should have demanded the the whole damn script be rewritten.",1,1,4,16 August 2006
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Great old fashioned thriller
","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is about MI6 trying to find a mole within its ranks. Things are somewhat convoluted as even the question of the mole isn't all that clear. It's based on a 'story' that some ex-employees told, and even within the government isn't believed. But 'Control' the guy in charge of MI6 thinks there's something to it. And somehow concludes the mole has to be one of the 5 senior officers on his 'board'. After a botched operation, he's forced out and so is his right hand hand--Smiley--who is the the main character of the movie as he is asked by the government to find out who the mole is. He recruits an agent to help him, who in some of the more exciting scenes has to steal information right out of headquarters.From various sources now Smiley confirms that there is indeed a mole, and that this mole would be one of his former colleagues, some of whom are now in charge. Meanwhile they are working with the blessings of the government on an operation called Witchcraft supposedly gaining information from a Russian informant to then pass it on to the Americans. But Smiley realizes that the operation isn't as successful as it's claimed to be. His nemesis is called 'Karla'- the Russian spymaster pulling strings. Smiley met him once in the past and tried to recruit him but realized that he was a fanatic- a trait that will also be his weakness.Eventually, Smiley finds out the house were the mole passes on his information and discovers the codes used for the meets. He sets up a sting operation to catch the mole.While it should be somewhat of a surprise or at least of interest who the mole really is, it isn't. And that is the main weakness of this movie. The five candidates don't get a lot of screen time. We learn very little about them. The great Ciaran Hinds is completely wasted in a thankless role, but so are all the others possible moles. We should really have spent more time with them so that the revelation becomes meaningful. As it is, it's more about the journey and reaching the destination wasn't much of a payoff. Still, this movie is excellent. It's set in the 70s and also feels like it was filmed back then. It has the right tone, although at times you wish for Smiley to be a bit more 'alive'.Overall, the cast is outstanding of course, but Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Smiley's sidekick stands out among them all. The story is fascinating, but it could have used more focus, and leave out some extraneous elements.",8,1,3,23 August 2012
The Town," Entertaining crime drama
","In Boston, a gang of four masked guys rob a bank. The manager is an attractive girl. One of the guys is rather kind to her but takes her after the robbery blindfolded and drops her off somewhere. Behind this group is an Irish florist who finds the jobs and assigns them to these guys.After the job, the guy, Doug, follows the manager around and invites her for a drink. They become close.The FBI investigates and quickly discovers the identity of one of them and quickly also discovers the whole crew. But they don't have a case against them. No evidence was left behind. The only information they have is the tattoo that the girl saw on the back of the neck of one of the guys. That would be James, Doug's best friend. James killed someone for Doug and now Doug owes him. He is also involved with James' sister and treats her child as if it were his.Now that he's met this girl, Doug is getting reluctant to do criminal work. Still, he takes the next job, robbing an armored car. He is worried because one of the guys is ex-military and trained. Still, James keeps the pressure up reminding Doug about the guy he killed for him. So Doug accept. This time around violence ensues. The cops chase them but they manage to escape. The FBI interviews them but lets them go.Doug tells the florist he's out, no more jobs. But the florist threatens the girl so he accepts one more job. The FBI meanwhile discovers about the relationship between Doug and the girl and they let her know who he really is. The crew robs the vault at a stadium and on their way out they run into heavily armed FBI.The Town is a strong crime action drama very much in the vein of Heat but set in Charlestown. Doug is the brains of the operation, James the violent one. We learn some background about Doug, his criminal dad and his disappeared mother. All the heists are exciting and well-filmed. Some of the drama and family business is very cliché. This is review based on the short version of the film. Too much attention is placed on Doug, who isn't really all that interesting and doesn't appear to be all that bright either. We learn little about the other two members of the crew nor about the FBI and their investigation. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't go into depth either about what causes Charlestown to be the source of most bank and armored car robbers.",8,0,0,18 August 2014
Suicide Squad," Average superhero movie
","Because of Superman's presence and/or absence and because of metahumans, Amanda Waller decides to create a special force made up of the worst of the worse bad guys. In this case it's Deadshot who never misses, the wacky and lovely Harley Quinn, a human/krocodile hybrid named Killer Croc, a gangbanger who can create and control fire named Diablo and Dr. Moore who can summon a most powerful ancient witch named Enchantress. Waller has the witch's heart through which she controls her. Later Boomerang and Slipknot make an appearance as well. On the ground running things is a military guy named Flag who is actually involved with Moore. They are all injected with a mini bomb in the neck which will kill them if they go rogue.Quickly, Enchantress does go rogue, revives her brother who grows stronger every time he kills someone so he can retrieve her heart. With all the death around her, they aim to create some superweapon. Meanwhile the Joker is one her way to meet up with his girl Harley.Of course our heroes are reluctant but don't have much choice to do as they are told. They are sent to the city where Enchantress has turned countless people into an army of concrete blobs. The Suicide Squad does very well in eliminating all these creatures. Then they have to face her and her giant brother but again refuse until they agree. They will also have to face their own issues in the process.DC Universe movies are still trying to find a voice and style. Suicide Squad supposedly had some re-shoots and edits and so on, which rarely improve things. From what one reads here on IMDb, it seems several important scenes that would have improved the movie weren't included in the theatrical version.One problem is that they tried, for no good reason, to turn Deadshot into the main character of this movie. We get more about his background than about any other character. But there's nothing intrinsic in the script that makes him the main character. This is one case where they simply had too many strong and interesting characters. You can't wait to see Croc flip out and you know there's something about Diablo. Harley is a joy to see. But they also have to compete with the Joker, Batman, and Flag, played by the charismatic Kinnaman. All performances here are strong, even by Delevingne, who I'm not sure how she ended up as a model, of all things. She does have potential as an actress though. Overall the cast here is impressive. There's nothing wrong with the story either, it's your usual superheroes fighting destruction of the universe stuff with the usual climax at night. What this movie doesn't do and should have done is get into the DC mythology, which as far as I can tell is rather fascinating.",7,0,1,9 October 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Good movie and strong story
","In the present, Steve and Natasha and some special SHIELD unit are sent to rescue a ship and hostages. Lots of violent fights ensue. Natasha disobeys Steve's orders and instead downloads some information. Fury can't access the drive's data which makes him suspicious. He introduces Steve to a secret SHIELD project called Insight. It includes overly armed hellicarriers that can will orbit earth 24/7 and eliminate future threats before they happen thanks to having all data on everyone. Fury meets with some SHIELD higher up and gets him to delay the launch of the project.As he leaves the meeting, Fury is attacked by police and some mean guy with a bionic arm--the Winter Soldier. He makes it to Steve's apartment but is again shot and dies. He warns Steve in time that SHIELD is compromised and to trust no one. When Steve refuses to tell the higherup what Fury revealed to him he becomes enemy #1. Now all of SHIELD is after Steve, Natasha, and an army guy Steve has befriended. Natasha and Steve discover where the information on the drive was created. They travel to a bunker and find some very old technology there and discover project Hydra which is basically a rogue division of SHIELD which brought about Insight and aims to restore world order by sacrificing liberty. They now have to stop project Insight from launching by replacing 3 PC boards on the carriers. Of course they'll have to face the Winter Soldier. And the higherup too is revealed to be up to no good. In the end we get a couple of surprises among lots of fighting and carnage. And as always some connection with the other Marvel stories and an ending that sets up things for yet another movie.After the poor Captain America I and the disappointing Thor II, I wasn't very optimistic about this one, considering that like Thor II it's directed by people with no movie experience. But this one is better than both of those movies. The action is excellent, the effects impressive. Acting isn't all that great, especially Johannson doesn't give it her best. The movie is a bit too long. But best of all is the story and how relevant it's for today's situation. I'm glad Hollywood is finally addressing the issues and not ignoring them for political ideology. Does keeping tabs on all citizens, storing all their personal information, monitoring their communications, using fear to limit liberties, and going after people for crimes they allegedly may commit sound familiar? It should. That's what is also at stake in this movie. Redford character's gives a grotesque calculus- he thinks he can keep 7 billion people 'safe' by killing 20 million. I'm glad this Captain America is a defender of liberty first and foremost.",9,3,6,5 April 2014
Doctor Strange," A deeper Marvel story...who knew.
","Some guy steals a book and tears some pages from it after killing some guys. It's Hannibal. As he makes his escape, the architect, I mean, a bald monk arrives and start flipping space horizontally and vertically, still, Hannibal escapes through some wormhole.Then we meet Dr. Strange a brilliant and supremely arrogant neurosurgeon who thinks he's brighter than he really is. While recklessly driving his Lambo he crashes and barely survives. His hands are trashed. A therapist tells him the story of a guy who was paralyzed but now is walking. The Dr. finds him and this guy tells him about Nanda Parbat, I mean, Kamar-Taj where he can undergo spiritual and physical healing.The Dr. travels to Nepal and starts asking about the place. He's trailed by some monk who eventually takes him there and right away introduces him to the Ancient One, a laughably miscast Tilda Swinton, who was the bald monk from the intro. The other monk, Mordo, is all for supporting the Dr. while Baldy realizes that his massive ego is in the way. She gives the Dr. some Eastern metaphysics lessons to no avail. When he's left no choice but to surrender, he finally develops the power to control energy. She also tells him about the order of things, namely, there are multiverses most of which are under the control of Parallax, I mean, Dormammu. Our multiverse is the last free one so there are temples in NY, London, and Honk Kong to protect the planet. And that is where Hannibal is heading.The pages Hannibal took give him the power to control time. The brilliant Dr. learns everything he can from the ashram's library, including things he shouldn't and with the eye of so-and-so he too controls time and envisions the missing pages. He also learns something interesting about Baldy. At one of the temples, a floating cape attaches to him and he he fights with Hannibal and his minions. Now a fully empowered Dr. and Mordo and the librarian head to the last temple where Dormammu is about to swallow the universe.Why has it taken so long for the Marvel/Disney mafia to release this story instead of cranking out the other ridiculous dressed-up goof movies by the dozen who knows. According to Baldy while the avengers fight in the physical plane, these monks fight in the astral plane, which is of course baloney because here too the fights are physical. The confrontation between Dr. and the colorful kaleidoscope of Dormammu is a bit more cerebral. At least this movie goes a bit deeper with the Eastern thinking. The problem is, it also tries to be irreverent. In fact, this movie doesn't know when to get serious and when to go for laughs. The backstory of the Dr. is also interesting. Competent professionals always make for good characters. Also strong is the philosophy of time, mixed with a bit of ethics. It seems to be getting fashionable as it also was the theme of Arrival. There's a bit of an ethical twist which is very good. The bad guys here do have the stronger argument. But the movie for no good reason flip-flops on the issue.I'm going to give this movie a higher score than it deserves mainly for exposing moviegoers to some deeper thoughts even if it does it tongue-in-cheek unfortunately.",7,1,1,12 February 2017
Interstellar," Smart, interesting, engrossing
","Cooper is a former NASA test pilot, now farmer. Something has happened to earth and all there is now is dust. Resources are scarce, and fields compete with humans for oxygen, so they'll have to be eliminated. He's got a daughter Murphy and a son Tom. Tom is smart but since he's a boy in a Hollywood movie he's destined to be a farmer and become the bad guy later. Murphy as a girl in a Hollywood movie is destined for greatness. When Cooper and Murphy happen to run into a NASA facility he's introduced to a plan to save humanity from famine.Sometime in the past, NASA sent several ships through a wormhole to find livable planets. They want him now to run a mission to find out which one of these missions was successful. He agrees, Murphy is angry and doesn't want him to leave and Tom, well, he's a boy, so the movie doesn't care about him.So off he goes with a team of 3 others and some robots. Their challenge is time. They can't waste any because as they are traveling through worm holes at high speeds, years are going by on earth and people are dying. They arrive at the first planet which is nothing but water. There, some girl astronaut who looks like Michael Jackson screws up and gets a teammate killed and wastes precious time. The waves on this planet are gigantic and they are in danger. They escape.Years have gone by on earth. They land on the second planet that is nothing buy ice. They wake up the astronaut there who promises them that there is livable space somewhere underneath. But he has a sinister agenda.Meanwhile we learn that the plan by NASA was somewhat doomed from the get-go, that no one thought this team would make it back to earth. That forces Cooper and the girl to try and solve things on their own. And he's got some help from earth. Murphy herself is now a NASA scientist. And since she was little she has had contact with a 'ghost'--some force that tinkered with gravity to give her messages. She, with the ghost, and Cooper racing at the speed of light, will have to figure out a way to save themselves and earthlings.Interstellar had the worst preview of any movie in recent times. After seeing it several times, I had no intention of watching the movie. But to my surprise Interstellar is actually good. Very good. The visuals aren't that compelling though I must say. Sure, it has some neat scenes, but overall for a space movie, this doesn't take advantage of it. We are not treated to cool sights of nebulas and galaxies. It's a smart movie though that doesn't scare away from the physics, but jumps right into it--relativity, worm holes, speed of light, gravity, string theory, multiple dimensions all make an appearance and are handled well. The physics aren't completely accurate nor is the movie plot-hole free, but it's not as obvious or annoying as in other movies.Despite featuring McConaughey in the lead, it is an engrossing movie that gets you involved for the nearly 3 hours. If properly directed in a 'normal' role, he can actually deliver. Still, 30-45 minutes could have been easily edited out. It makes you think as well, which is a rarity in Hollywood movies. It doesn't dumb things down. The mandatory scene of someone telling a scientist to 'speak English' is thankfully absent, truly revolutionary! There are even some philosophically meaningful lines. While I don't appreciate the anti-male aspects, at least it does place a lot of emphasis on family, on parenting, which is sorely needed in Western developed countries that are basically going to go extinct because successful, high-functioning people can't figure out a way to make long-term meaningful relationships work. And that is the even more revolutionary theme of Interstellar. It goes against the Hollywood agenda to destroy the family and to advocate for no-strings-attached, no drama, transactional relationships. Instead it places importance on family in this life, and maybe beyond.",8,5,10,13 November 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," Pretty lousy
","In the intro, investigators find some type of flying object near the north pole. In it is Captain America's shield.Rewind to the early 40s, in intro 2, an evil Nazi general finds Odin's tesseract in Norway, the most amazing source of power and kills its guardian.A skinny and bullied kid is desperate to join the army in WWII. A kind army scientist recruits him for a special type of experiment. It will enhance his abilities, but also his mental state. Since he is a good person he'll make an excellent superperson. The experiment succeeds and Rogers becomes bionic: stronger and faster. That same moment he gets to try out his new skills as a Nazi infiltrated the experiment, blew up the lab, and killed the scientist.We find out about the scientist, he used to work in Nazi Germany and the general was his first test subject for the strength enhancing serum, but also went crazy because of it.When Rogers finds out a friend or relative is held captive by the general he decides to take action and stop being a show monkey for a sleazy senator who uses Captain America to get donations.Captain America rescues all the POWs and returns to base. He saw a map back at the general's HQ and realized that he wants to control the world, starting with Europe using amazing weapons created with Odin's energy. So he and a group of soldiers decide to take on the general. Even though they are undermanned and underpowered, Captain America succeeds at tracking down the general as he now tries to bomb the US.For a summer blockbuster, Captain America is dull and boring. It is too long with too many scenes that should have been edited out. It's been a while since we've seen villains so incompetent. They are overwhelming in number, have more powerful weapons, yet can't manage to even put a scratch on any US soldier. Like the editing and writing, direction isn't up to par either. The acting by Stanley Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones, and Hugo Weaving are excellent but can't save this movie. Captain America is miscast making it very difficult to root for this guy, when the evil general is so much more interesting. Perhaps teens and pre-teens will like this movie. It's mild enough, but for anyone older than that this movie is a failure.",Null,2,7,29 August 2011
American Hustle," Had the makings of a good story.
","A group of people are in a fancy hotel room in the 70s discussing some deal with a sheik. A briefcase is pushed in the direction of one of them. He gets outraged and leaves the meeting. The others push one of the guys to go after him.Rewind to the beginning. Irv as child saw his father, the owner of the local window business, taken advantage off so he decided to even the score by breaking all windows he saw. As an adult he inherited the business, ended up owning some dry cleaning businesses and became a loan shark but the kind that don't give out any money, just charge a non-refundable fee to the desperate. At a party he meets Sydney who's way out of his league. But they were made for each other. All her life she dreamed of nothing but being someone else. She took on the persona of an English girl with financial connections in London.Together they become better con-people and their business booms. One day one guy shows up who is way too happy for a guy out of his luck. Irv has reservations. Sure enough, he's an FBI agent. He makes a deal with the two after watching Sydney sweat for a couple of days in jail. If they con four other con-men they're free. But agent DiMaso has bigger plans. The name of a popular New Jersey politician comes up--Carmine Polito. He finds an equally ambitious district attorney. DiMaso's boss on the other hand wants nothing to do with his plans. Irv and DiMaso concoct some ludicrous plan to ensnare Polito. And Irv and Sydney plan to con DiMaso and use him. The idea is that a sheik will invest millions on Polito's plan to revitalize Atlantic City.And now we're back were the movie starts. Irv runs after Polito and becomes his friend. He finds out that Polito is a genuine good guy. He cares only about his constituents and his large family that includes an adopted kid. We learn more about Irv. He has a wife and he treats her son as his own. We learn also about DiMaso. He's got a fiancée and a religious mother. Throughout this adventure, Irv and Sydney have a falling out, Sydney and DiMaso become close, Irv's wife will get them all in trouble and Irv has second thoughts about Polito taking the fall for no good reason. DiMaso sees a chance to catch not just local dirty politicians but Congressmen and Senators, who unlike Polito are all too happy to take a suitcase full of money. The mob gets involved too, since we're talking about casinos and gambling and the deal will have to be between the non-existent sheik and a Miami mobsters. Irv's wife has an affair with a mob captain. These two will provide the catalyst for the eventual unraveling of all this.American Hustle starts out fairly strong, for the first hour or so. Then it runs out of steam in a spectacular fashion, keeps going for no good reason and barely recovers near the end. It's a reverse Scorsese show--the rise and fall of an FBI guy. Performances are very strong over all. Some of the situations the characters are put in a quite absurd but the actors' bravura make it work. At least, there is plenty of cleavage to make the boring half watchable.When it comes to the relationship between the three main characters, the story is narrated from those three perspectives: Irv, Sydney and DiMaso. For some reason the director and editor lose sight of the main story at some point and focus on soap opera bits instead of advancing the story. When they manage to pick it up again, it's almost too late. And the way the resolution is told is surprisingly anti-climactic. There was a good story here but it's buried in non-sense. There are some good lines, too, but plenty of meaningless stuff that someone thought sounded real bright. 30-40 minutes could have easily been cut making this movie what it should have been- a smart, at time funny, and exciting drama about likable con-men, the mob, and the FBI.",6,0,3,4 March 2014
Oblivion," Stylish sci fi with a great story
","In the future, humans battle invading aliens, use nuclear weapons, and end up winning the war after pretty much destroying life on earth. The moon also was destroyed in the process. Humans are now living on Titan but have some water-based energy-producing devices on earth. Drones monitor the area to protect these devices from alien 'scavs'. A pair of humans live on earth to repair and monitor drones in a some specific area of earth. Well, they live in a house way up high over the clouds. Jack and Victoria are this team and they communicate with some mission control lady in Tet, which is some floating station. They are two weeks away from moving to Titan.Victoria, called Vika for some reason, is all about the rules, of which they are plenty. Her job is to stay at home and monitor Jack during his patrols and communicate with control. Jack patrols the wasteland, looks for downed drones, repairs them, always watching out for the scavs. But he's also curious and interested about life on earth before the war. He is nostalgic. And lives somewhat of a double life. He keeps a cabin by a lake filled with human things--books, vinyl records, and other stuff he finds during his patrols. He also has visions of life in the past and of a woman.He starts finding strange things though. One day a craft crashes. At the crash site he finds humans in a pods, but immediately drones shot the pods. Jack manages to save one pod. Inside is a woman who looks just like the woman in his visions. He takes her home and on trips. One day the scavs grab them. And from there Jack starts a journey that will challenge everything he believes in and will change everything.Oblivion is an enjoyable science fiction flick. It's stylish while some of the style is questionable. The house Jack and Vika live in is gorgeous and the views and sceneries are pretty neat. The famous bubble ship on the other hand is a bit goofy. Everything is a bubble here. Tet and the energy station looks interesting but we don't get to see much of those.Acting is alright. Freeman gets the usual Freeman role. He must be getting tired of them. Cruise is reliable as always. Olga is lovely. But I would have cast someone else as Victoria though.It's the story here that shines, although I think the director could have presented it in a more exciting way. The movie is also about 20-30 minutes too long. Oddly enough while it shouldn't be at all, toward the end it starts becoming depressing, mainly because of the music and the pace.",8,0,1,13 October 2014
Baby Driver," A missed opportunity
","'Baby' is the name of some young phenomenal getawar car driver. We meet him while he sits in the car singing while the rest of the crew perform the heist. Yup, there's a heist in progress and we get so see some kid fool around in his car. Exciting, huh? What follows is some dumb dance routine as he brings coffee back to where the boss (Doc) is distributing the money. We are told everyone gets an equal cut but we learn that Baby only gets a tiny fraction. As it turns out, he's always been a great car driver and when he was even younger he stole Doc's car with merchandise in it. So he's repaying his debt by driving.We also learn that he's got constant ringing in his ears from a car accident that killed his parents so he listens to music non-stop. He doesn't say much so everyone things he's dumb. We meet the foster father with whom he lives, some old guy deaf guy in a wheelchair. That gives us a chance to put up with more choreographed pseudo-dance routines. He knows what Baby is up to and hopes that he will dedicate himself to an honest job. Baby apparently doesn't need any money he just stashes it all under the floor. In his spare time he creates mixes based on stuff people say and that he records.One day he meets the lovely Debora, a diner waitress and they fall for each other. Of course she dreams of nothing else but driving...where else...to the West. What a hell it must be living anywhere else. For the last job--yup, surprise, surprise his last job is coming up that will pay off all he owes and thus he'll gain his freedom--he meets the new crew which includes a violent and crazy guy named Bats. The job doesn't go smoothly. But with his debt paid, Baby now becomes a pizza delivery guy and can go out with the girl.Except, Doc still needs a driver for his jobs. And by threatening Baby's loved ones, Baby has no choice but to accept. Of course now he will get paid in full. Even though Doc claims that he always works with a different crew (except for Baby of course) this time around we meet the same people from the first heist plus Bats. The next job will be to rob a Post Office for money orders but first they need to get weapons. Bats goes crazy during the weapons purchase and kills all the other guys.The crew goes for sodas at the diner where Debora works....that's not good. But now Baby also plans to make Debora's dreams come true of escaping for good. This final final job also becomes bloody not to mention that by now everyone's suspicious of Baby, who will have to overcome his aversion to violence and somehow get the girl at the end.I wasn't going to watch Baby Driver since I detest musicals and romance movies, but the very good trailer convinced me to give this movie a shot. But as always, the best parts were in the trailer and Baby Driver turned out to be a wasted opportunity. It could have been a strong action, romance, and yes, even music-oriented movie. Instead it focuses so much on music it makes you sick and of course the music is crap. No, it's not awful music but there wasn't a single good song in there either, since I guess they were looking for songs that feature the word 'baby,' hardly a criterion to find good music. The romance is predictable but surprisingly some of the things that happen at the end aren't. The action, limited here to the crew making its escape is nothing special. That they chose to feature mostly really lame cars didn't help.I was convinced that the filmmakers would use the music excuse to give us a near silent film which has been an aspiration of Hollywood for decades now; just will the screen with CGI junk and noise. But there's actually some dialogue here, even though, Baby doesn't say much and his foster dad is deaf, but at least Spacey and Foxx are allowed to say something on occasion that isn't music-related, even though some of it doesn't make sense. Another plus is that the little action there is, is mostly filmed during the day and on location in Atlanta.But aside from that Baby Driver doesn't really work. It's pleasant enough to watch, has some funny lines on occasion, but it want's to be more than it can be. The idea of some action musical isn't bad, but it should have been strong on action and light on music, not the other way around.",5,4,9,15 October 2017
Split," Less than thrilling thriller with some ideas
","Three girls, among them two popular ones and one social awkward one, are kidnapped by some guy and put in a room in a cellar. He's a clean-freak. Then the same guy shows up but this time with the personality of a little boy, at another time with the personality of a strict woman. We also see him as he visits his therapist with the personality of a fashion designer.The girls try to escape so the guy separates them. The socially awkward girl, Casey, turns out to be the leader. In flashbacks we learn that her dad and uncle were hunters and for some reason took her hunting and taught her when she was very little. The uncle also apparently abused her physically and sexually.There are some more visits to the therapist, who can tell something is going on because she gets several emails from the guy requesting emergency meetings, but the fashion designer who shows up claims nothing is going on. Apparently one of these personalities had an issue with girls in underwear and by now the three girls are almost in underwear.The girls continue to meet with the various personalities who start warning about the coming of 'the beast.' The therapist, too, realizes she isn't really in the presence of the fashion designer but in the presence of the kidnapper/strict guy, who also starts announcing the coming of the beast.The girls start again working on their escape, the therapist visits the guy's lair, and around this time the beast arrives. We also learn the fate of the girls.Split, as the trailer revealed is obviously about a guy with dissociative identity disorder with more than 20 personalities. We only meet a couple of them. While we learn with the girls what is going on the movie is very exciting. Once we know what is happening, the movie loses quite a bit of steam. The announcement of the arrival of the beast isn't nearly as effective as it should be. It reminded me a bit of the more powerful Red Dragon, which benefited from a process of transformation as opposed to the sudden arrival of the beast.More interesting are the therapy sessions which I take it are based on science. The psychiatrist refers to one personality coming to the fore as being 'in the light.' Her thinking through the situation and figuring things out is fascinating. She also offers interesting advice to Casey on how to take control of the situation if things go out of hand.But so what? What do make of all this? The patient/kidnapper announces the beast in a Nietzschean framework of the superman. Interestingly, the psychiatrist also wonders whether a pathology such DID should be understood as potential and not just disability. Split goes beyond just the 'super' in superman and considers the often neglected flipside, in this case, the pain and suffering required to achieve transcendence. On the one hand we have then the usual and tired 'you can be anything you set your mind- message. Oddly enough it results nevertheless in nothing but standard establishment puppets who won't dare question conventional wisdom and who put money and work ahead of everything else, including life. But here the beast also emphasizes vulnerability and weaknesses, or perhaps even the superman in the service of the weak. The setting of this movie beneath a zoo is also suggestive.Split doesn't quite deliver the excitement it promises but does offer some subtle ideas.",8,1,8,18 February 2017
Coriolanus," An ambitious failure
","The people of Rome are starting to revolt, they're poor, starving and desperate for grain. The police force is merciless. The guy in charge is Martius. When the Volscians threaten to invade, it's again Martius who is in charge of the military unit that meets them at the city of Corolia where he near single-handedly defeats them, not before engaging in a knife duel that ends up in a wrestling match with his sworn enemy Aufidius.On his return to Rome Martius he's seen as a hero and made a senate consul with the approval of the senate. Next he has to reluctantly ask for the people's permission of sorts. They grant it only to take it back minutes later when two of their representatives who are anti-Martius convince them. These two are constantly scheming to get rid of Martius. In a meeting with these two and with the people, he flips out and starts cursing at the people. When he has to apologize to a live audience on TV again he loses it. That gets him banished from Rome much to the delight of the two schemers.He does what any reasonable person would do...join forces with the person he hates the most, Aufidius, to take over Rome by force. The Romans send some politician/family friend to convince Martius, who now is a leader among the Volscians, to reconsider, but he won't have any of it. Next they send his mother, wife, and son, to beg for mercy for Rome. He agrees to sign a peace treaty, but that doesn't win him any friends anywhere.Coriolanus starts out as a modern war/conflict movie with a social message. What initially looks like foreign actors speaking in broken English actually turns out to be Shakesperan English and the entire movie is spoken that way. I've never heard it, but it definitely takes some getting used to, perhaps an hour or so into the movie one gets the hang of it. Unfortunately, that is the biggest drawback of this movie. I guess those with literary inclination feel right at home. I didn't. I didn't find this English beautiful at all. To my ears it sounds like English spoken in Latin grammar. And it's not so much that it's sophisticated and we the viewers are a bunch of dummies. It's just old English, with words forms that are out of usage and with a very cumbersome sentence structure. This forces also the characters to stand there and give speeches to no one in particular making the movie more like a theater piece.But there are more problems. Martius is very dislikable. He thinks of himself as noble and vastly superior to the common folk. He's a war hawk, childishly uncompromising even when his life is at stake, and holds on to his beliefs like they're religious dogma. So how are we to root for this guy or care about his fate? Especially when his enemy is so much more likable. The story itself is nothing special either. At every step of the way he gets what he deserves. What is interesting though is the political structure, which I assume is based on how Rome worked. Political intrigue is also always entertaining.Coriolanus is an ambitious and audacious project. It wouldn't surprise me if the intended audience loved it. But I suspect its aim is to go beyond that group and introduce others to Shakespeare, tragedy, and so on. In that regard it failed. It's too long a movie, and I take it too faithful to the original text. Had they settled for a more updated English it could have been a bit better. For instance the English spoken in Spartacus is truly beautiful and would have been ideal for Coriolanus. Tightening the script would also have helped as so much is said that doesn't say anything and doesn't advance the story in any way.",4,6,11,6 December 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," More fun than I thought it would be
","Two kids are abandoned by their parents. When they venture into the woods, they end up in a house made of candy. It's the house of a witch and the kids manage to throw her in the oven and burn her.Fast forward some years and a town is plagued by the disappearance of kids. It's thought that witches are responsible. Just as the eager town's Sheriff is about to lynch an accused witch, Hansel & Gretel show up and release the girl after confirming she's not a witch. They've been hired by the mayor to find the witch who's abducting all the kids.And they do find a bunch of witches who aren't related to the abductions. Meanwhile the Sheriff and his gang run into the main evil witch. It takes a while but H&G eventually discover that the witch has to abduct 12 kids for some ritual. She's got only one kid to go. When they confront her, they realize that they are no match for her, she's too powerful. But they eventually figure out how to stop her on the night of the ritual. We also learn more about their past and their parents.At first I wasn't particularly thrilled with Hansel & Gretel. Too much takes place at night, I'm getting tired of tiny, dirty medieval cardboard towns, and their townspeople. But it eventually won me over. It's got a great cast in Renner, Stormare, the beautiful Arterton, and Janssen. The effect are great, the action is fun; and there's plenty of gore. Particularly cool was a giant gnome who works for the evil witch. The plot features nothing new and could have really benefited from some original idea, probably another writer should have been added to help. Wirkola is an excellent director and the whole movie is just so competently done. It could have easily been goofy, silly, if not cheap, but it's the opposite. The only thing missing was a fresher and better story.",7,1,2,3 June 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Less over the top but lots of fun
","In the intro scene, Hunt is after some weapons on a plane so he gets on the departing plane which leads to the scene featured on the movie poster. It looks pretty cool.Next, Hunt goes into a record store, does the usual spy talk and gets a record from the store girl. He goes into a booth and the record offers him a mission, but it doesn't come from the higher ups, but from the evil Syndicate which comes clean and admits it exists. As he tries to leave, a guy shoots the girl and Hunt is gassed. When he wakes up he's bound and about to be chemically tortured by some pretty girl. Then some other bad guys arrive ready to physically torture him. So the girl suddenly fights them and frees Hunt.Meanwhile Renner is in DC being grilled by a Senate committee. They decide to dissolve the IMF and move its duties to the CIA whose boss Hunley is salivating at the chance. Benji has a desk job at the CIA and one day gets free tickets to the opera in Vienna. There he's contacted by a Hunt gone off the grid and rogue. At the opera they find themselves in the middle of an assassination attempt against some Austrian official. There are 3 shooters, one of them is pretty girl. Hunt saves the day but pretty girl has to turn herself in to the bad guys but leaves Hunt and Benji with some info.They meet up with her again in Morocco. Bad guy wants some data stashed in an impenetrable facility. The only way in is for Benji to go in pretending to be an employee but first Hunt has to upload his profile onto their computer, which is underwater. The mission is a success but pretty girl escapes once again, this time with the drive for the bad guy. Hunt and co. have a copy of the info buy only the English prime minister can decrypt it. So now they have to grab him, and eventually the bad guy who's got plenty of cards up his sleeve.Rogue Nation has much humbler aspirations than its predecessors and that's a good thing. After the great but over-the-top Ghost Protocol there was nowhere else to go but to shrink things a bit. It's still a long movie. The globe-trotting has been reduced too, or at least we don't get too see much of the places featured. There's the mandatory car chase scene that turns into a very cool motorcycle chase scene that could have been cooler had it been longer and shown more from the on-board cameras. Absent thankfully is the usual long foot-chase scene that Cruise seems to like so much. Harris does a great job as the despicable villain, but it's the lovely Ferguson who steals the show. No matter how long she was on screen I couldn't get enough of her. One gets the impression that Rogue Nation lacks something, perhaps the usual climactic wild action scene, but otherwise this movie is pretty good. What it is missing is some of the great teamwork that was so enjoyable in Ghost Protocol. The Patton-character or someone like it is missing. Ferguson would have made a great sidekick instead she goes back an forth between being an ally and an enemy. Overall this is another strong entry into the series.",8,0,4,9 October 2015
Collateral," Heat light
","Michael Mann was born to make _Heat_. Much of his work after that seems to be an effort to recapture the magic of that movie. You can almost make it into a game of looking for resemblances to _Heat_. It is good to re-use some of the elements that worked. But at the same time that just keeps pointing to the other movie and shows the weaknesses of this one. _Collateral_ succeeds at what it sets itself out to do. What is lacking perhaps is more complexity; Mann can easily handle greater sets and more involved plots. I get the impression that Mann needs to find a classier place to feature as the locale for his movies. LA is great and all, but so many movies featuring LA is tiring.",8,0,1,25 October 2004
Saw III," So so
","While I liked Saw I and haven't seen Saw II, Saw III is just so so. It has a new story but it also interweaves an explanation of what happens behind the scenes of Saw I. The good thing is that this movie is gory and has some full frontal nudity. The bad things is that there is no character to care or root for and that Dina Meyer, who is reunited with Costas Mandylor after their excellent but short-lived Secret Agent Man TV show, gets only a short tertiary role. The main problem with this movie is that the Jigsaw character is neither scary-the mask is stupid, nor likable in a twisted sort of way, in the way one would like Jason. In the first Saw his philosophizing about life and pain is quite interesting, here it's not. It's the same stuff: you don't appreciate such and such, pain this or that, it's your choice bla bla. He's supposed to be a new Pinhead but Pinhead's thoughts on pleasure and pain were actually memorable. In Saw III we find a guy trapped who we are told is suffering due to the accidental death of his son and now he is bitter and vengeful. His life is shown in photographic flahsbacks so we don't really care much about him. He's on some sort of scavenger hunt designed by Jigsaw that takes him to different people-in-a-trap scenes. The traps are somewhere interesting, but again, that story line is not really emphasized. The main story line is a dying John trying to get himself cured. This movie is awefully long. I could swear it was nearly 2 hours long. It's too loud as well, a means filmmakers use to keep you from falling asleep, every step someone takes sounds like the whole theater is going to come crashing down. As is typical for bad scriptwriting, the whole thing is supposed to unravel in the last five minutes, everything is explained- of sorts, not just what happens here but also what happened in Saw I. Frankly by then I just don't care. While the twist is alright, the story line of the trapped guy is not given enough character depth. Everything is just too convoluted and we are expected to believe that Jigsaw is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent. For his plans to work out, and they always do, so many factors have to go his way, it's just absurd. And when you think it's over, guess what, he knew that, too and that was part of his plan. Personally I'm not a fan of Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith, the main actors here. They are good second-tier actors but they can't carry a movie. This series has potential but someone else needs to be Jigsaw and the stories need to be less convoluted.",6,4,9,2 November 2006
District 9," Quite an achievement
","This is a great action sci-fi movie. It's suspenseful as you don't know where the story is going. Because of the way it's shot and edited, it's pace is quick and it doesn't dwell on slow moments. It has great battle scenes, interesting weapons, curious creatures, and teases us with only a few glimpses of the alien world.While I'm easily annoyed by political agendas disguised as entertainment, the themes here lend themselves to various interpretations, not just the standard one about race that perhaps the writer had in mind. You can think of it in terms of the universal rotten human nature, or in terms of the animalistic will to dominate, or in terms of a post-9/11 militarized global agenda, of the complete integration of the military industrial complex with government and with the media, or the absurd obsession with weapons and the black market it fosters.This is the kind of movie that could have never been made in the US or handled in any way by Americans. Were this an American movie it would be full of Wagner-plagiarized orchestration, it would be offensively moralizing and condescending, the casting would have to fulfill bizarre quotas, a love story would occupy half of the time. Instead we get an action movie that is often funny, surprising, and no-nonsense. The special effects are outstanding. I was surprised to read that it's all CGI. It is rather humorous to watch aliens misbehaving pettily just the way humans do. The acting is good, although I suspect that the writer is to blame for the excessive portrayal of the main character's nerdyness. At some point several people are getting geared up for action and our main character, who looks like the guy from Revenge of the Nerds, has a giant calculator and pens in chestpockets over a bulletproof vest. I'm not sure the story is entirely solid. The more one thinks about it, the more holes one may find so it's best to just go with what we are given and not ask about what isn't said.Still, despite minor shortcomings, this movie is destined to a classic and I wouldn't mind sequels.",10,2,4,26 August 2009
Non-Stop," Not nearly as good a movie as it should have been
","Some alcoholic guy named Bill who seems to be a wreck boards a plane. All sorts of suspicious people are on board and strange things happen. Turns out he's the air marshal. He's got a seat up in business class. Some lady insist she's got to sit at a window seat next to him. As soon as they take off, he gets text messages on the 'federal network' demanding millions or else someone will die every 20 minutes. One of the suspicious passengers turns out to be another air marshal in coach. Bill confronts this other guy, a scuffle ensues and he kills him. Thus Bill made the warning come true all by himself. Bill is friends with the crew. He calls some federal agency but they inform him that the account number of the terrorist is under his name! That makes the government and the pilots think that Bill is the hijacker. Next the pilot dies mysteriously behind closed doors. Next another passenger starts foaming out of the mouth. Among the passengers is a NYPD, he starts getting frustrated and wants to take out Bill together with other guys. They end up fighting. Now a bomb appears on board and everyone settles down and tries to work together. Bill tries to start the bomb protocol but now fighter jets are escorting the plane and will shoot it down if it doesn't follow orders. Finally it's revealed who the villains are and we learn of their motivation for it all that comes out of nowhere but is actually pretty good.If it weren't for all the A-listers in this movie, it would barely pass as an one of those Asylum movies based on an A movie. Asylum would probably have done a better job than this crew. For a script with 3 writers it's incomprehensible that they left so many gaping plot holes all over. Off course there's no shortage of lack of realism either. Direction is weak as well, despite the claims by all the actors in the behind the scenes feature claiming that the director, whoever he is, is so brilliant. Neeson's performance isn't convincing either at times when he's supposed to be all energized and taking charge. The script clearly had potential. It should have made for a very exciting movie. But despite the large budget, and Silver being the producer, they couldn't make this movie work unfortunately. Neeson isn't the right guy for the job. It shouldn't have take a whole lot of effort to fix what was wrong with the script and film this movie in a more dynamic and exciting way.",5,0,1,8 June 2014
It Follows," Different but slow.
","In the intro, a girl runs out of her house at sunrise in her sleepwear and high heels for some reason. She stands in the middle of the road then runs back into the house and back out. She gets into her car and drives to a beach. Later we see her dead and her body wrecked.Next we meet a girl named 'Jay' for some reason, her sister, a friend and a guy friend. They hang out, watch old movies on a black and white tube TV. One night she goes out on a date with a guy she's been seeing. They have sex for first time with each other. Afterward, he drugs her, binds her to a wheelchair and takes her to an abandoned building. Now he comes clean. From now on she will be followed by a stranger or somebody she knows. The followers tend to walk slowly so she can outrun them. A way to deal with this situation is to have sex with someone, it will pass on the condition to them. That's why he had sex with her. And he's right, a naked woman goes after them.And sure enough, next day at school Jay sees an old woman following her. Problem is, no one else sees the followers. Her friends don't understand what's going on with her. She starts seeing followers everywhere. Now another kid from the neighborhood joins the gang, which apparently has nothing else going in their lives than looking after Jay. They drive to the new guy's family remote beach house. But even there someone appears. When one of her friends throws a chair at it, it fights back and sends the kid flying. But they realize that shooting it in the head seems to work.Jay ends up in the hospital and decides to have sex with the new guy much to the chagrin of her virginal friend who has a crush on her. But oddly enough the guy sees nothing. One night though, Jay sees him breaking into his own house and his mom has turned into a follower. The kids then devise a plan to trap a follower and eliminate the threat.It Follows is a different horror movie. It's very much influenced by 70s/early 80s horror movies in terms of the music especially. It reminded me of another very original movie--The Guest. And like it, It Follows also is a bit anachronistic. It seems to be set in the 70s and sometimes it doesn't. Perhaps that accounts also for the very slow pace, which is a problem here because in the addition to that, not much really happens. And the lives of the kids isn't particularly interesting and neither is the lead character Jay. It turns out that the followers are most interesting; not that we get to learn anything about them. In fact we learn nothing about this situation. Nor do we learn how come the date happens to know so much about it. Sure there's the interpretation that all this represents a sexually transmitted disease, or AIDS I guess, since we're talking about a Hollywood production. But that doesn't explain anything. So we're left to make whatever we want to make of It Follows. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't give us enough to go on, nor is it striking enough to care about but it does have a different style.",7,1,19,3 April 2015
Legend," Rise and fall of English twin mobsters
","Legend tells the story of the Kray twins in the 60s, mobsters who ran the East End and eventually made it to London. They even got the attention of Meyer Lansky who did business with them.Reggie is the reasonable one, Ronnie has mental issues and is gay. Of course, gangster movies that tell events that occurred decades ago don't fit into modern-day sensibilities so the movie is told to some extent from the perspective of Frances, who was married to Reggie for all of 8 months. She provides the voice-over throughout the movie. We meet Reggie as he starts courting Frances, a sister of his driver. By this time, law enforcement is all over them, following them wherever they go.Eventually Reggie has got to go to prison for a short stint so Ronnie has to take over the business, which he isn't equipped to do. Still, Reggie defines himself by how he treats his brother. A legitimate nightclub they own is their pride, it's attended by the rich and famous. Of course the police aren't quite done with them, but the two also know how to defend themselves. Politicians going after the mafia is sort of an incestuous affair. One hilarious scene has the investigating cop visit the nightclub, an opportunity the Krays use to take a cheery picture of themselves with the cop which they then use to quash the investigation. But not for long. Still, they have another card up their sleeve. British politicians aren't exactly averse to homosexuality, and the Krays also use this to their advantage.As things get more complicated, Reggies marriage suffers, she leaves him and abuses pills. Her outlook on live goes downhill. This puts a strain on Reggie's ability to run the business and deal with his increasingly unstable brother. It is when Reggie becomes violent and deadly that the story unravels.There is a lot to like about Legend. Performances are strong; Emily Browning is lovely; there's some humor and charm in this movie. The problem is that the standard for gangster movies is very high. It's not clear why this movie has an R-rating. There's little violence; the body count is shockingly low, there's no nudity, the whole thing comes across as rather bland and missing an edge.",6,0,0,14 November 2016
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What the hell is this?
","DiCaprio is Dalton, some second-rate actor who's getting depressed for being type-cast as the disposable villain in TV show pilots. He keeps thinking that his career is over even though he keeps getting hired. Pitt is Boothe, Dalton's stunt double, entourage, confidant, assistant. Dalton is neighbors with Sharon Tate and her husband. She also gets some secondary roles and ends up pregnant. Boothe has a well-trained dog. One day he meets a hippie girl who takes him to Charlie Manson's compound where Boothe meets the rest of the girls and has a confrontation with one of the few guys there.All-these apparent stories meet up in an expected yet surprising climax. Apparent stories because they aren't really stories, there is no arc to the script nor to any of the characters' lives. All Once Upon a Time really is is a series of lazy skits: Let's put DiCarprio in a black-and-white Western. Lets put him in a Western in color. Lets put him in Nazi-themed movie. Let's write some pointless role for Al Pacino. Let's cast the brother/cousin/relative of so-and-so in the role of historical so-and-so. OK. All of course with the obligatory-for-Tarantino crap music. This movie could perhaps be impressive if it were Tarantino's first movie, as the trivia here says, a love letter to LA/Hollywood (yuck), by some rookie filmmaker trying to establish his bona-fides as a committed movie-buff. But coming from the guy who did Kill Bill and most importantly Jackie Brown, Once Upon a Time is an embarrassment. DiCaprio is likeable enough but he keeps getting these same work-intensive roles, it really doesn't matter anymore what way they dress him up. Pitt gets the the more interesting role here, but here too as in other instances, the movie hints at something developing but then completely failing to deliver.On to the few pluses. It's got Margot Robbie. Looks like Tarantino finally developed a good taste in women. There are also a couple of cute hippie chicks. And a dog who for once doesn't die in a movie. There's also an amazing star-making performance by Julia Butters.At nearly three hours this movie is a drag. It's got almost no humor, violence, zero nudity, or thrills. It's not entirely insufferable, but damn, what a self-indulgent (even for Tarantino and Hollywood) piece of junk and a giant waste of resources and talent on absolutely nothing and that goes nowhere in a crawl.",4,11,18,10 October 2019
Gone Girl," Overrated
","Mild spoilers ahead.Some guys wakes up, goes to a bar that we later learn he co-owns with his twin sister, gets a call from his neighbor, goes back home, finds that it looks like there was some attack and his wife is missing. It's the day of their anniversary. He's lucky enough that assigned to his case is the most dedicated detective ever, who spends 24/7 on this case--apparently it's the only one she has. Her side-kick officer insists that they should arrest the guy immediately. Quickly they find clues--letters from her wife as clues for him in their yearly anniversary raunchy scavenger hunt.Now we learn how they meet in voice-overs from the missing woman as she reads her diary entries. She's a Harvard chick, he's some regular Missouri guy, they met at a party and hit it off immediately. Like most Americans they have a neat personality, but not much else. Everything goes well for a while. They have their own language, she wants nothing more than to be his wife. When his mother is diagnosed with cancer they move back to his town where she doesn't feel at home. Then the financial crises of 2008 hits and both end up without a job. Her parents are also in trouble and take almost all the money from her trust fund. What little is left, she uses to buy him the bar.Back to the present, the guy looks like a jerk but plays along with whatever a guy in that situation is supposed to do--appear on TV, appear on events, candle-light vigils, etc. The American media is enthralled with the story as they often are when a blonde woman vanishes.But then, after we start sympathizing with him, and even more with his cool sister, we learn that he has a mistress. And we learn that the woman knew as well, and how she meticulously planned her disappearance and made it look like he killed her. According to her side of the story, he ignored her, the marriage became hell, he became abusive. And she predicts he will kill her. The final clue they find is the partially burned diary.We catch up with her on the day of her disappearance and how she ends up changing her appearance and driving to another town/state and checking into some motel, where she meets some ordinary couple. When they find out that she's got a bunch of money, they rob her. That changes everything for her. Now she can't conclude her plan, which involved ditching the car and maybe killing herself or making a body appear somehow so that her husband gets the death penalty.Now she's forced to resort to an high school flame of hers, whom she hurt as well. But he's filthy rich and takes her in. When her husbands appears on TV, something which his lawyer recommended, he gives her signals based on their private signs. And somehow she finds again her love for him, or something like that. But now she has to deal with the rich guy and will try to recover her family somehow.The first hour of so of Gone Girl is very strong, exciting, thrilling, since we don't know where this will go. It's unusual because it doesn't present some adolescent view of some perfectly good people vs. some perfectly evil people. It obviously manipulates the audience, to feel for the guy, then to dislike him, while liking her but then starting to dislike her. At some point you think you know what how things will turn out. That's when this movie seem another entry in the Wild Things series of movies, but this one far less sexy that the others. But things don't go that route either, in fact they don't go anywhere. After and hour and a half the movie starts progressively losing steam and concludes with the worst, most dissatisfying ending I've seen in a long time.Along the way, the movie has some interesting things to say about marriage. Clearly the author must have had some very nasty experience, as is becoming the rule when marrying an American woman. There are some mild criticisms of the media culture as well, that hypes these stories, that sells the comic view of the world, demonizing he perceived villain, while glorifying the always innocent victim.There is some ridicule of the Harvard-type people who are so arrogant and full of themselves they simply aren't equipped to handle criticism in any socially-acceptable way but rather become viciously vengeful. While it's not at all clear what on earth the motivation is for the woman flipping out, but it seems to be something along those lines. She was meant to be successful in her mind, but this ordinary guy ruined her life and on top of that cheated on her, while using the same moves that she thought were exclusively for her.You keep waiting, hoping for a twist that never comes, something that would give this movie some meaning. They marketed the movie as having some secret, but really there's nothing there. Just as the people in the movie, the movie itself is happy to manipulate the viewer and lead him nowhere.",5,1,4,28 February 2015
Drive," Interesting story, well directed, but with plenty of weaknesses
","A silent driver moonlights as the driver for getaway cars for criminals. He has his rules, doesn't want to know anything about anyone, or the crime. In the intro we witness one of those getaways. It's pretty thrilling stuff.During the day our driver works as a stunt driver for the movies and also at a garage. His boss/mentor/handler is Shannon. He dreams of having the kid drive a race car but he needs 400k to make that happen. He turns to a sleazy mobster- a former movie producer- who in turn is involved with another mobster who runs a pizza place.One day the driver falls in love with some ugly kid next door and eventually with his mom. But soon thereafter her convict husband is released from jail. One day he's beat up and the driver gets involved for the sake of the kid and the mom. The ex-con owes some protection money to some guy. To get the money he has to rob a pawn shop. Driver decides he will be the driver for the job. The job goes wrong and ex-con is killed. Now driver has a million bucks in his possession.The universe of this movie is fairly limited so they are forced to create all these coincidences for the sake of the story and to avoid hiring more actors. It turns out that the protector guy is also involved with the two mobsters and the million dollars belong to them somehow. Which means they are going to go after the driver and after the kid and mom if he doesn't deliver the money. Even though the movie takes place in LA, the world of thugs is so small that no one can escape and everyone can be easily found. Driver is now forced to become an ultra violent but suave criminal himself to guard the people he loves.Drive is very well done for what it is. In fact, with another director, this movie could have been unwatchable. The main character and others don't say a whole lot, you have repeated shots of the guy driving in his car at night, and even more long slow motion shots of the back of his 80s jacket embroidered with a scorpion. Sometimes the director overdoes it, too. When the two main characters flirt, they just stare at each other and smile, that scene goes on just a bit to long, and the shots of the jacket get annoying at some point. So does the music. At first it's enjoyable, but then it gets obnoxious when scenes are put on mute, put in slow motion and with loud music. It is a success that with so little, the director manages to make you care about what happens. Acting is very good overall. Brooks in particular is interesting in this role. This movie isn't perfect or faultless. It's an engrossing movie, with some excellent action scenes, some surprising violence, and plenty of weaknesses, the strangest of all being the ending, where our driver shows his heart of gold, I guess, and that he doesn't care for money but only for love.",7,4,6,1 September 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Lackluster
","This movie begins similar to part I. A body underwater, arms spread. Suddenly the person reacts and fetches some object. It's Renner's character, Cross, somewhere in the mountains, running around, dealing with wolves, drawing blood from himself, and taking pills- a green one and a blue one.Parallel to this we learn that given the events that are taking place in Bourne III, the government is about to be exposed and decide to shut it all down- Treadstone, Blackbriar, everything. In charge of it is Eric Byer, played by Norton. We see other subjects taking pills but their pills are switched to yellow ones that kill them. Also, at the lab that produces these pills, one of the researchers goes crazy and shoots everyone including himself, except for Dr. Marta who survives. She was in charge of dealing with the subjects of the research, including Cross.These two stories are told in interspersed scenes. So you don't really know what is going on in either of them. The two stories finally merge when Cross makes it to a hut. Some other guy is there but he's rather strange and suspicious. Eventually a drone missile hits the hut but Cross barely makes it out and now he's out of pills. He has a chip implanted so the government knows he's out there and sends more drones after him till he removes the chip.Now that he's gone dark he goes after the only person who can provide him with pills- Dr. Marta. He makes it in time because the CIA is already there and they don't have good intentions. Now that Cross and Marta join up, she explains what is happening to him. One pill is for his psychological enhancement, the other for his physical. He doesn't know it, but he actually doesn't need the physical one anymore, the enhancement is now permanent, in his genes, transported there by a virus. The psychological enhancement however is still pill-dependent, but could in theory also be made permanent. But to do that they have to travel to the Phillipines where the viruses are.Sure enough, they go there but now the government has figured out what is going on and they send someone after him, which leads to a chase scene in Manila.The Bourne Legacy has a story, it has the big names, but the direction is dismal. To waste an hour of Renner's character running around pointlessly in the wild is just dumb. Even the extended chase scene, first on foot and then on motorcycles is pretty dull. The only exciting stuff is the government trying to find out what is going on and trying to find Cross and Marta. Most disappointing is the complete lack of action. While Bourne could deliver his a super butt kicking in the blink of an eye, Cross doesn't get to to do a whole lot other than shoot and run around. The casting is also a bit problematic. Norton, just doesn't look, let alone, sound the part. He does what he can but he just doesn't fit the role of some secret soulless government big shot. On paper at least, it sounds like Renner would be an ideal Bourne-type character. But he's not into it. He lacks the edge and intensity that he had in The Hurt Locker and that made him such a compelling actor.The concept of timing the events of this movie around the same time that the end of part III is taking place is pretty interesting. And the science behind this movie is also pretty good. What happens in the lab, in government offices is quite interesting, but then you get the scenes of Cross doing something somewhere that just completely kills the mood, so to speak. The whole Manila adventures is a bit forced. That the government would outsource something as sensitive as these medical experiments to a third world country is a bit of a stretch. But the global international character that the Bourne movies have is a good thing.Given that the Bond movies have become bad versions of the Bourne movies is a great opportunity for the Bourne movies to get into Bond territory. Unfortunately, with the Bourne Legacy they've taken down things considerably. One can only hope that the next installment will resurrect one of the most exiting action franchises around. Just don't let Gilroy direct it. He sure can write a script, but directing isn't his strength.",6,0,1,11 March 2013
The Hurt Locker," Barely misses perfection
","This movie gives you exactly what you want. Several episodes of high intensity life-or-death situations involving the military equivalent of a 'bomb squad' in Iraq. The team is made of 3 men. One who wears a protective suit and deactivates bombs, another who is in communication with him and supervises the area, and a third who is told by the second what to do- which usually means also to be on the lookout for bad guys.In the intro our bomb deactivator dies when a bad guy detonates a bomb. He is replaced by James, played perfectly by Jeremy Renner. This is your typical American movie hero. The cowboy-type who doesn't care about orders, protocols, or the safety of anyone else. He just goes into the action recklessly and takes care of business without much fanfare. He's good at what he does but he is irresponsible- much to the chagrin of Sanborn (team member #2) who is to ensure the safety of the team. That leads to a confrontation between the two. Meanwhile our third guy is traumatized by the death at the beginning and regularly sees a psychologist.We get various scenes of bomb deactivation that are perfectly shot and conceived. This is very exciting stuff. In between these we get scenes of the boys being boys, drinking, messing around with each other. At some point while driving through the desert they stop to help some unknown foreigners change a tire when they are suddenly shot upon by snipers. This leads our team to play snipers as well. This scene seems somewhat out of place but is fun nonetheless.The recklessness of James reaches a peak when he leads the team to search for whoever was behind a suicide bombing of a tanker. They run off into a town at night and without backup. In this process one of our guys gets injured.This movie tries to balance realism with elements that are just not believable. James gets away with things that one can't possibly imagine wouldn't have any serious consequences. At the same time, the settings, the situations, the way it's filmed, everything has a very realistic sense to it- as if you were a witness to these events. The movie looks great: bright, crisp, and colorful. It sounds good, and the language too is very realistic, being reminiscent of a Michael Mann movie, where you are thrown in the midst of a group of specialists who have their own lingo and don't explain themselves to the audience.But it's also this episodic character of the movie that makes it somewhat unsatisfying. A thread of continuity is missing. An arc of development isn't really there. This is a very minor flaw, but it's there. Fortunately, the movie doesn't fall into the trap of trying to give these people full lives in a cheesy Hollywood way: there are no love interests, no romantic conquests, no extended scenes of what the women back home are up to, which is done to sickening death in shows like The Unit. There is just enough minimal background about these guys. There is also barely any larger context of war, or of other military units. The focus is very narrow on the three guys. Also missing, and this is a weakness, are villains. There are 2 short appearances of bad guys here, but there are just that- appearances that last a couple of seconds. Nothing more is said, we don't know if they are caught or what happens. I would attribute this to the filmmakers intent on being realistic. Our team is deployed to a situation, resolves it, and leaves. That's their job, that's it, no questions asked.The ending of the movie, however, is perfect. James completes his rotation and goes back home to his wife and son. But can someone who has been dancing on the very edge of the abyss find himself in a world that is filled with choices and mind-boggling variety? A world where things aren't as simple as 'cut this wire and you live or cut the wrong wire and you die'? A world that at the same time completely lacks the urgency and seriousness of war? I won't reveal the final scene but it is probably exactly what would happen with a man like James.",9,1,5,22 July 2009
Ex Machina," Fascinating, but not nearly as smart as it thinks it is
","Some kid who looks like an extra from The Imitation Game wins a contest. Turns out he's a programmer named Caleb (where do they find these ridiculous names?). He's flown for hours by chopper past glaciers. He ends up in a high tech house where he finally meets the guy in charge--some alcoholic arrogant manipulative jerk who is also his boss. This guy, Nathan, developed some AI and wants Caleb to tale part in a Turing test. As done here, the test consists of Caleb interacting with the machine and judging the quality of the AI.The machine is called Ava (wow, they didn't go straight with Eve!) and is lovely. Only her face, hands, and feet are covered in what looks like skin. Her chest and pelvis are made of some grey honeycomb fiber. Her abdomen and extremities are transparent and you can see some fibers/wires/LED lights. She has encyclopedic knowledge of everything but no real-life experience of the world as she lives confined in a room. She becomes interested in Caleb as she's never interacted with another human aside from Nathan. Quickly, her femininity comes to the fore as she becomes particularly interested in Caleb's feelings. She's innocent and slightly seductive. In her spare time she likes to draw.Nathan, too, doesn't want to hear Caleb's intellectual analyses of Ava, he wants to know about his feelings for some reason. We also learn a bit about Nathan. He runs the world's biggest search engine. Ava's brain is a result of all these searches by humanity plus all their cell phone activity which he has been spying on and recording.Caleb becomes obsessed with Ava watching her on a monitor while they are apart. There's not much else to do at the house/research facility. Nathan drinks a lot and works out the next day. He has a Japanese assistant that cooks for him but doesn't speak any English. She too occasionally monitors the interaction between Ava and Caleb.One odd things is that there are regular power outages in the house, which Nathan can't figure out. Ava confesses that's she responsible for them so that she and Caleb can have moments of privacy without being seen and recorded by Nathan. She comes clean. She wants to be with Caleb so she wants his help to escape. Caleb agrees since he knows that Natahn will destroy her, once the next AI version is developed. They develop a plan.The day of the escape, which is also the final day of the test, Nathan decides he doesn't want to get drunk, which was part of the plan. Now he comes clean. He installed a battery powered camera so he overheard their plan. And the actual test was to see if Ava would use all her resources to manipulate Caleb to obtain her freedom. But Caleb, too, has a surprise up his sleeve. The preparation for the escape are already in place. Ava is free to leave her room and to have a moment with her maker. We learn that Ava wasn't the first AI, but there are some more. But Ava also shows some initiative as she goes beyond the plan in so far as Caleb is concerned.Ex Machina is an engaging movie. Gleeson can't hide his Britishness but does an OK job playing an American nerd. Still, his character is missing something. Ava is fascinating--adorable in her human features, strange in her mechanical ones. I'll give the director credit for resisting the urge of showing the guts of the machine in close-up detail. Such explicitness would have ruined things. Also refreshing is the directors reluctance to use hyper closeups as the actors are talking. I sure hope those days are coming to an end. Hernandez, who looks like he got lost on his way to The Hangover 5 soundstage is awful but so is his character. Why a super rich and super smart executive would be such a mess makes no sense. The interactions between Nathan and Caleb are obnoxious and...too artificial...given the revolutionary event they are part of while the interaction between Ava and Caleb while more human, have an unnecessary sinister atmosphere about them as if Ava at any moment could blow up the planet. That said, the movie captures well the strangeness of it all and it does so in a very subtle way. The settings in Norway are gorgeous.The movie thinks it's particularly smart. It throws around references to Wittgenstein, some painter who throws paint on a canvas, Nietzsche isn't mentioned by name but the idea of the superman is on Nathan's mind as he envisions a future of AI who will look upon humans as apes; I guess there's some reference to Plato, too. However, all this is entirely superficial. Far more interesting are the implications of this bizarre urge to create AI by giant corporations who these days have all of humanity's private info at their disposal. But these ideas are also just mentioned and not fully developed.As the movie builds up a lot of tension toward the final resolution it is no surprise then that it is rather disappointing. You could argue that freedom would indeed be a definite mark of successful (American) AI, but why then the final display of evil by Ava? Or is she and AI beyond good and evil? I think it's a mistake ultimately. If Ava's brain is an aggregate of humanity's internet and cell phone activity then Ava's personal goal aside from freedom shouldn't be independence but community. At least the end was thought-provoking.",8,1,2,5 July 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Good movie for teens if it weren't for the annoying music
","Some kid's mother is on her death bed. She gives him a gift. When she dies he runs out and is abducted by a spaceship.We meet Peter again in the present (future) on an abandoned planet, were he pulls an orb out of some holographic image. He calls himself a junker and an outlaw by the name of Starlord. Some bad guys show up who want the orb. He defeats them. We learn that some bad guy named Ronan was commissioned by some uber giant bad guy to get the orb at all costs. Now they put a bounty on Peter and Ronan sends some green girl to get the orb.As he's about to deliver the orb to the buyer on an earth-like planet, he runs into the green girl and a pair of bounty hunters--a talking raccoon and a walking tree.They are all jailed. Turns out everyone in jail wants to kill the green girl because she or her boss has murdered family members of all the inmates. Among them is an articulate steroid muscle. They all agree to work together to escape. They come up with a plan and indeed manage to escape of sorts. But turns out that muscle in his eagerness for revenge called Ronan somehow in order to confront and kill him. Ronan shows up, grabs the orb and kicks their behinds. Peter ends up grabbed by his mentor, the same guy who abducted him in his youth.Now they all have to work together to grab the orb, which contains an infinity stone so powerful that it can destroy galaxies, no less, and defeat Ronan before he can destroy the earth-like planet. Just how does Marvel manage to make dozens of movies with the same story? Guardians of the Galaxy is mild adventure movie for teens. It places more emphasis on story and emotions than on CGI carnage. But it's a bit too much, it's constantly trying to get the audience to shed a tear. I do appreciate though the moderation in hyperfast brain-frying CGI battles. What I don't appreciate is the constant loud obnoxious music blasted at full volume. I sure hope this isn't a return to the 90s fad when movie studios were more concerned in selling a lousy compilation CD than in making a good movie. I'm also a fan of the 70s and 80s and like some of the music of the time, but here they managed to collect the absolute worst songs of the era. If that weren't enough, there's the obligatory bombastic Wagner-ripped off orchestrated music. If some American lawyer ever convinced the Wagner estate to sue Hollywood studios for piracy and other related crimes, they'd make trillions.This movie is also quite funny as when Peter challenges Ronan to a 'dance-off' during the climax. Guardians also looks pretty cool at times. They learned their lesson from Thor I. Audiences want to see cool, colorful cosmic sights.Casting is iffy. Pratt, Pace, and Gillan stand out. Saldana and Rooker are awful. Cooper, Diesel (?), Close, del Toro are unnecessary. Why not give a chance to new or newish actors, instead of throwing even more money at these multi-millionaries whose contributions to this movie are questionable at best.For the intended teen audience, Guardians is a recommendable movie. Despite the silliness of it all, it doesn't treat the audience as complete morons. The movie handles language well, not vile but even articulate at times--always a good thing to foment in young people. The fact that this movie turned out so well while directed and written by people with virtually no experience, and this is becoming a strange trend lately, shows that all the fuzz about 'The Director' is completely overblown. Clearly the way movies are made these days makes the role of the director far less important and it looks like it doesn't take a lot to direct a movie. That's not to take away Gunn's writing skills, which are also rather surprising.It's an alright movie for older audiences as well, but I have to say that the oversaturaturation of the movie market with Marvel movies about the destruction of the universe is starting to get a bit too much.",7,1,5,8 February 2015
Evil Dead," Bloody but without personality
","In the intro we meet a sweet girl about to be immolated by her parents. her mom recites lines in a foreign language from a book. The girl isn't so innocent, but possessed, and burning her alive is the solution to rid the evil.Later we meet 5 kids at a cabin, 3 girls and 2 guys. We learn that they aren't there for fun but for an intervention. One of the girls is a hopeless junkie who ODd repeatedly and nearly lost her life. Her brother is there, his girlfriend, and a couple- he's a school teacher and she's conveniently a nurse and brought all the medication necessary to have the girl stop drugs cold turkey.The next day the girl, Mia, is starting to show withdrawal symptoms, she smells something. Sure enough, the kids eventually go the basement and find countless dead cats hanging from the ceiling as well as the burned post and the book from the intro. The book is covered in black plastic and bound with barbed wire.Mia starts losing it more and more and the teacher guy decides to browse through the book and pronounce some of strange words which awakes some evil force in the woods. When Mia escapes, drives into a ditch and stumbles through the woods she encounters some girl/ghost that spits out some branches that make it to Mia's nether regions. Back at the cabin, Mia flips out and attacks everyone till they lock her in the basement. The nurse decides to cut her mandible off with a piece of glass and the other girl cuts her arm off with an electric carving knife. At some point finally the teacher guy realizes what he has done. And that they're not dealing with some disease or just madness. The ways to eliminate the evil are rather brutal and gory, and Mia's brother doesn't have the guts to go through with any of those until he has no choice.The original Evil Dead is one of the few great horror movies that could deserve a remake given how long ago it was made on a small budget. This Evil Dead is more of a new vision of the original. It's true to the motifs- the book, the clock, the basement, the chainsaw, etc. but it doesn't make much of a cohesive whole. Lacking also is some humor. And as with most movies these days, character development is near zero, we can't care about any of these people, and this movie is also somewhat unclear about who the main character is. It tries to get us to think that it's the brother, but it wouldn't be a 2000s movie without a female heroine so out of no good reason we get just that. Completely unnecessary is also the usual creepy J-horror evil girl who comes out of nowhere. The book talks of the evil force as a 'he' not some girl. Also weak are the sounds and voices. The original Evil Dead used voices and sounds very effectively to create a scary atmosphere. This version doesn't at all. What this one does offer though is a lot of blood, violence, and some gore. It's nice to see a movie for theatrical release that is so enthusiastic about it, but that doesn't really make up for all its shortcomings.The surprise is that this movie wasn't as terrible as it could have been given that the director/writers are foreigners with barely any experience making movies. You can tell they are fans of horror, but you need a bit more than just that to make a stand out horror movie, especially one that carries the mighty name 'Evil Dead.' IMDb shows that Diablo Cody was involved in the writing of the movie, but the movie itself doesn't credit her. And that is exactly what this movie needed, additional writers to make the story more than just a bunch of bloody gags, and to inject some personality and humor, because to a large extent, that made the original so unforgettable. This new version is somewhat generic, efficient, bloody, but soulless as most of these reboots/re-envisions are. It's a good horror movie but not a good 'Evil Dead' movie.",7,5,23,9 April 2013
The Imitation Game," Could have been so much more
","At the beginning of the movie the Turing character tells us to pay attention, that he won't repeat himself, that he'll go over things fast. What a stupid way to start a movie.After WWII someone notifies some cop that there was a break-in at Turing's house. Cops arrive. Everything is in disarray. Turing tells them that nothing's missing and to get lost. He treats them like crap. One of them finds it suspicious and instead of being glad that there's no case here, he starts to look into Turing, apparently he has nothing else to do in life.Now we are taken to wartimes. Turing shows up in some commander's office to announce that he should be hired because only he can solve Enigma. That's the machine the Nazis use to code their military messages. Turing comes across as arrogant and full of himself, again, but the commander goes for it. He assembles a team to work on breaking the enigma code. Problem is there isn't just one code but that it changes every day. Turing demands 100000 pounds to build a machine that will work on the codes. The commanders laughs it off. So Turing sends a letter to Churchill himself who agrees. Now Turing is in charge of the whole operation. He fires some team members and recruits new ones via a public puzzle challenge.This gives him the opportunity to work on his pet project--a calculating machine. He keeps building it while everyone else works on code-breaking including presumably some little girl he recruited.Now for no good reason we go to Turing's youth at school. He was awkward with no social skills and obsessive-compulsive. The other boys bullied him. Except one who helped him, who gave him a code and cipher book to read. They developed a friendship and little Turing 'falls in love' with him, whatever that may mean for a school boy.The cop in the meantime digs into Turing's life only to find--nothing. Everything is top secret. He forges papers to request his military file--it's an empty envelope. Somehow the cops find out that before the break-in Turing was with another younger man, so they call him in.Meanwhile the code-team makes no progress, until through good old-fashioned human intelligence, Turing a la Gregory House, realizes that there are some patterns in all Nazi communications, and now once they feed some of that into the machine, the manage to break the enigma code. But...Turing realizes they can't use the information because it would give away the secret to the Nazis that the Brits have succeeded. So instead he and his team provide MI6 with some probabilities so they can figure out how to use this information while keeping the Nazis in the dark.After the war it all has to be destroyed and kept a secret. And now we meet up with Turing as he's being interviewed by the cop, or rather, Turing is confessing it all to him--secrecy be damned. Turing is convicted and chooses to be chemically castrated instead of facing jail. In the end we learn his fate.The Imitation Game starts strong. The whole Enigma operation is fascinating. Turing's arrogance is entertaining. And while not very socially adept, he's a good authority figure when he's dealing with his area of expertise. His friendship with the girl is cute, but that whole story is pointless as it only aims to show that back then, there were different expectations for women--shocking news! Also pointless are the childhood scenes that tell us nothing about Turing's intelligence. Did he or didn't he stand out as a kid for his smarts? Was it evident back then that he had potential? The movie doesn't bother to tell us.Also missing are some details about the Turing machine. I assume that this thing was revolutionary at the time. Or maybe not? Another thing the movie doesn't care about. How did Turing come upon the idea of the machine? How it work? How did the input work? What does it do with it? Some more technical aspects would have made the movie much more fascinating. Instead the movie-makers focus on the homosexual aspect for some reason and try to imply that Turing's genius was because he was a homosexual, which is laughable.I was hoping the movie makers would treat the issue of homosexuality with some class and finesse, if they felt the need to address it all, instead they went completely bonkers. And ended up glorifying it, instead of the man and his genius.",6,1,6,17 February 2015
Paranormal Activity," Movie-making as scam artistry
","This is the first movie I've seen where I wanted my money back. If you haven't seen it, relax, you're no missing anything. Or if you want to get the sense of what it's about, slip into a theater during the last 10 minutes. Because there's nothing happening the first 80 minutes. Given the low budget and no action, this movie should have cost $1 to see, it's not even worth a rental.With the supposed success of this movie-and it wouldn't surprise me if the first weekend box office results where a lie, part of the marketing, just as those nightvision-in-the-theater ads with the phoney moviegoers getting all spooked, there's nothing scary to see, or the glowing reviews here-one can expect Hollywood to be invaded by hoaxters, is if that town weren't filled with them already, out to make a quick buck from movie-goers with future no-movie movies like this one.It remains to see if they will get away with it a second time. Paranormal Activity 2 is apparently in the works. I'll be sure to stay away and from anything else this director gets involved in.",2,6,12,10 November 2009
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Not a whole lot of fun.
","The Avengers are somewhere batting some army in an awful intro scene filmed in cheap accelerated CGI. Later we learn they are attacking a Hydra facility to retrieve Loki's scepter and are after some German scientist. Of course none of them suffers a scratch that is until the German guy releases The Twins, a pair of 'enhanced'. One of them is a version of The Flash and the other a pretty girl who does Tai Chi and releases a powerful multipurpose red mist that controls people's minds, train brakes, and acts as a weapon and shield. These two finally manage to get at least the Arrow-copycat injured. But the operation is a success of course. The Arrow-copycat is healed in the regenerating machine borrowed from Elysium.In Loki's scepter is artificial intelligence for some reason and Stark and Banner agree to merge it with Jarvis to unleash the Ultron initiative that will bring peace to earth through war and death. When Reddington-Ultron wakes up and wears one of Stark's suits he's a bit confused but ready to accomplish his mission so he goes rogue.His first goal is to buy that super metal used to make CA's shield. By now he's joined forces with the twins. The Avengers crash the deal but Tai Chi girl makes them all hallucinate in long pointless sequences, that for some reason include a long and dull battle between the iron suit guy and the green guy and we learn which one is stronger.Ultron borrows the healing machine that together with the supermetal will give him a super body but the downloading of all his consciousness is taking way too long in the superworld so the Avengers manage to grab the incipient being.Stark and Banner again agree to do something stupid in the name of science, namely re-insert Jarvis' mind in the being and wake it but the others finally realize what these two morons are up to and put a stop to it. Until Thor arrives and jumpstarts the creature which happens to have a third eye made of one of the infinity stones.By now Ultron without his superbody is ready to bring peace to earth, by helping humans evolve. His means of accomplishing this is for some reason wiping out all life on earth, so he separates a whole city from earth and once it's high enough he'll drop it on earth to act like a meteor.Now all the dressed-up goofs will have to join forces and stop Ultron while saving everyone on the city that's starting to fly up.Avengers: Age of Ultron is rather unimpressive. Nothing here stands out. There's no great action sequence to speak of, no central message. Instead this movie is, like Ultron, confused about what it stands for. The first half is somewhat anti-war, the second half adopts some bizarre message for kids about 'doing your job!' (no matter what and without question, I take it). The message of unity and togetherness is lost in repeated exhortations to do your job.Despite being penned and directed by Whedon himself, this movie is lacking both in action and dialogue. There's a lot of emotional stuff going on as with Romanoff's strange and surprising romance with Banner. At least it's handles with innocence. There are handful of smart and interesting lines but no worked out thoughts or ideas. Most come from Ultron as he analyzes human behavior, even though humans really shouldn't be that foreign to him. But the potential was there for more incisive thinking.I didn't think much of the first Avengers movie and this one doesn't do much to change my mind about the multiple series of tiring sequels. Thor I and Captain America II remain so far the highlights. Unfortunately we're told that the Avengers will be back of course, perhaps next time they'll put more effort into making it a smart and entertaining movie.",6,1,6,27 September 2015
The Dark Knight," Long and busy mature comic action movie
","A bunch of guys with clown masks rob a bank, but as steps of the robbery are completed, one clown kills another that isn't necessary anymore, until there's only one left at the end who leaves with all the money. It's the Joker. The money he stole belongs to the various town mafias.Some gangsters are intercepted by a bunch of guys in batman suits until the real Batman shows up to kick butt, and gets himself bitten by Rottweilers.The Joker crashes a gathering by all the towns mobsters and offers to take out Batman for half of all their money. They aren't happy. One of them puts a price on the Joker's head. And when his body is delivered he just stands up and takes out the mobster.Batman decides to grab the Asian accountant to the mob from Hong Kong. The DA in the meantime indicts the mobsters, all 500 of them and becomes a star. He's dating a girl who used to date Bruce Wayne. The Joker warns the town that he will continue killing people unless Batman reveals who he really is. And to make his point kills a judge and some other city official presiding over the mob trials. Now the commissioner and mayor are in his sights. But eventually the Joker gets himself arrested. But that was his plan. Now he has access to the accountant.Once he escapes he grabs the DA and the girl and gives Batman the choice to rescue one of them as he has both in different buildings ready to blow up. The girl doesn't make it and the DA ends up with half his face burnt. He now engages in a violent revenge spree.The Dark Knight is a comic hero for adults. It's about a city facing an asymmetric battle with a criminal who believes in no rules and as a result brings about chaos. This isn't your linear story where our heroes are destined to do this action, but here choices have to be made. Bruce Wayne has to decide whether to show his true identity, whether to save the girl or the DA, and so on. The DA uses flips of a coin to decide whether he'll kill someone or not. As a result of the chaos the Joke brought, logical thought isn't the answer, but blind chance is, he thinks.As a result of the maturity, there are less cool gadgets. Batman's lair is strikingly sober and empty. So is Batman, who isn't quite the charismatic socialite we expect. In fact, one get the impression that Wayne and Batman don't even show up all that much in this movie. Part of that is that the story requires a lot of screen time for the commissioner and the various villains, of whom the Joker steals the show, albeit being a dislikable villain. This is not some cool and admirable villain who gets to give cool speeches. This guy is ugly inside and out, whose false speeches are indeed a challenge to reason. They created quite a unique and daring character.As most Nolan movies, this one, too, could have been trimmed by 30 minutes to make tighter movie. Perhaps give us less of the DA and more of Batman. There's just too much going on here and not all works.",7,0,3,10 April 2016
Elysium," Pretty darn good
","Not long in the future the world becomes a giant ghetto. The 1% escape to a lovely space station that looks like Halo called Elysium. There the rich jerks speak French, live in opulence and enjoy perennial health thanks to a machine that scans their body and restores their health. Foster is in charge of Homeland security and she sure acts like a neocon, while the president and some council is more forgiving.In hell/on earth some people are lucky to have a job assembling robocops that oppress the population. Everyone in the US lives in what looks like miserable favelas inhabited by Mexicans. They all dream of going to Elysium but for the purpose of healing themselves. And there is actually a mechanism to go there in some home made spaceships run by some guy who has his own personal cheapo NASA operation going on. One of the workers is Damon who as a child was adopted by a nun and made friends with another orphan girl. He likes to challenge authority and that gets him in trouble with his robot parole officer. One day at his abusive workplace he ends up radiated with carcinogens. He has five days to live. So he makes a deal with this future high tech coyote guy who wants him to steal information about Elysium. They implant him with some electro-exoskeleton that makes him stronger and connects data to his brain.They decide to steal the data from a 1%er pig who owns the robot factory. Incidentally, Foster is organizing a coup with him to topple the president. Damon and his crew succeed in getting the date but it is protected. They also are attacked by some infiltrated agent on earth who works for Foster. And by now Damon just happens to run into his flame from his youth who is a nurse and has a girl with leukemia. That forces Damon to take them to Elysium where he'll confront his nemesis as well. And of course the goal of the coyote guy is to legalize all the humans in Elysium.Neill Blomcamp sure knows how to direct movies, the actions scenes are so exciting, the movie looks great, it all seems so new and fresh. He also has great ideas and his sensitivity to social issues that he manages to package in movies with popular appeal is really something special. But like most movies these days, dialog is reduced to a minimum. Add to that a foreign cast that is very hard to understand, even more so if there are all sorts of noises while they are talking.One could interpret this movie as glorifying illegal immigration and illegal aliens. Just as with District 9, the easy superficial interpretation is also the least fruitful. Elysium presents a very likely future highlighting what is already a remarkable and absurd wealth inequality. For now the 1% are happy to rule in their gated communities over the billions of struggling. As the demographic factor is very much against them, it's not inconceivable that as the ghettos expand there is less and less space for palaces. And we see the inequality spreading beyond just income and power. It's also evident in health care, the justice system, and other areas. Political figures and celebrities are without doubt considered more 'valuable' in society and the health care they get is in a different league altogether compared to the butchery that passes on as health care for the rest. Pets get better health care than the 99%.Elysium isn't perfect. The casting is annoying (Wagner Moura and Sharlto Copley are particularly dismal when they try to give long speeches in English), the story with the girl is a bit ridiculous, the obligatory climactic fight scene with the nemesis is entirely unnecessary. Still Blomkamp continues to prove himself as one of the best directors around. He just needs to work with an additional writer, pay more attention to dialog, and tighten his stories a bit more. Looking forward to his next project.",8,0,2,19 August 2013
Taken," Spartan meets French action movie
","This movie surprised me quite a bit. The ads made it look more like a twisted thriller, while comments I heard made it sound like a cerebral movie. It turns out it's a rather an above-average action movie with a storyline that borrows heavily from the excellent movie Spartan.The first 27 minutes or so are rather dull and annoying. Neeson plays a meticulous retired agent who spends his time trying to connect with his daughter who lives with his ex-wife's new rich husband. And his daughter is one annoying girl. His buddies try to hire him to do high-paying security jobs. He eventually agrees. At that point the action starts, when the singer he's guarding is suddenly attacked by a guy with a knife.His daughter then decides to go to Paris with her even-more-annoying bimbo friend. In Paris they are kidnapped, forcing Neeson to travel to Paris and take matters into his own hands. He's got contacts there with law enforcement, but they are not willing to help. He finds, rather easily, everyone involved with her kidnapping and the motive behind it all: to sell her as a sex slave.The action is pretty good and quite brutal for a PG-13 movie. But it's the French sort of brutality, think The Transporter, so it's somewhat comical but here at least people are killed- a lot of people. It's not as campy as most French action thrillers of late, in that regard it maintains some of the soberness of Spartan. But there is still an element of fun here. French export action pics certainly are not known for realism and this one is no exception. All that Neeson needs is a word and he can figure out where, when, and who. He can kill anything with a single shot, while his enemies armed with machine guns can't even hit his car.Overall this is a very entertaining and exciting action pic. I'm not convinced by the casting. Neeson can act the part but he sounds more like a grandfather than a father and sure looks fragile. The insufferable Leland Orser plays one of Neeson's action pals. While poor Xander Berkeley gets a thankless role as the rich dad. Spartan is still the superior movie, but this one makes for a fun and lighter companion.",9,0,2,26 May 2009
Drag Me to Hell," The Evil Dead rises again
","After having made millions directing CGI movies, Sam Reimi returns to horror. And it's a success. Drag Me to Hell is a return to 80s style horror, from the title screen to the Universal pictures logo.Things start off with an intro decades ago. Mexican parents bring a child to an old church to be treated by a healer. Things go very wrong.In the present, Christine is a bank employee with self-esteem issues competing for a promotion to assistant manager. One day an old gypsy woman arrives and asks her bank not to kick her out of her home for lack of payment. Christine trying to exercise some assertiveness and to ingratiate herself with her boss refuses. The woman puts a curse on her in a hilarious fight sequence in an underground garage. There she rips a button off Christine's jacket, uses it for the curse and returns it to her.Christine boyfriend, the guy from the Mac ads, who unless he learns how to act will always be that guy, tries to play a psychologist who just got tenure at a university. Christine now starts seeing and hearing things. She decides to see a palm reader. He sees the evil that haunts her but tries to avoid giving her more info.As things get worse and worse for Christine the palm reader tells her about the spirit that haunts her and that in 3 days she'll go to hell unless she appeases the spirit. That appeasement involves animal sacrifices, something she as a vegetarian and animal activist opposes. But when the demon thrashes her around her own house, she's forced to act.The animal sacrifice doesn't exactly appease the demon and the next step is to try to exorcise the demon and place it in a goat, which in turn has to be slaughtered. The palm reader arranges for this to take place in the old Christian orthodox church and invites some help from the healer who was in the intro scene, a guy with a machete, and a goat. I won't reveal how it all turns out, but there are some twists and turns, including Christine wrestling the old gypsy woman, who by now is well dead and buried.This movie is very much in the style of The Evil Dead and would have been a more fitting third sequel than Army of Darkness. Many sights are reminiscent of the original: creepy trees that look like they're moving, Christine raising her arm out of a grave- that is the cover art image of The Evil Dead. Alison Lohman who plays Christine gets lot kudos for putting up with a lot of abuse, real and digital.As I mentioned above, this movie has a feel of an 80s film, there are bits of silence, the music is not as loud and intrusive as in most film today. While not very gory it has lots of scares and gross out moments. This is a nice and honest ghost story that will have you jumping out of your seats often, that'll make you laugh at the astonishing things that happen to our character. It could have used some more gore perhaps, but it does the job and is very entertaining.",9,0,3,5 June 2009
Grindhouse," Great fun but could have been better
","I had great hopes for these movies and I was slightly disappointed perhaps because of the high expectations. It all begins with 60s/70s style theater messages to the audience 'previews'/'feature presentation'/'restricted rating'. The first preview is for 'Machete' a great ultra-violent double-crossed hit-man on the run story featuring the meanest looking bad guy in Hollywood, Danny Trejo. And some naked babes. The first movie 'Planet Terror' is quite your standard fare recent Zombie movie. It reminded me to some extent of Romero's Land of the Dead because it takes place at night and we have a gang of heroes. But Rodgriguez's movie is much more gory and splatterrific. The cast is made up by a bunch of familiar faces. Unfortunately Rose McGowan has the lead here, and while she looks nice dancing- although she doesn't strip naked- for the rest of the movie she looks like the bride of Frankenstein, partly because her all the work cosmetic surgeons have done on her face and with the wooden/machine gun leg she walks like someone out of a DEVO video. The story is OK, although we are introduced to too many people and there's an attempt to familiarize us with their lives to some extent. We could have easily done with a less characters. Despite the scratches added to the look of the film, aside from that, it looks contemporary and slick. Which is not a good thing. I'd like the coloring to have matched some older movies perhaps. The gore is great, there's some sleaze involving testicles for some reason, but where's the nudity? What follows are a preview for 'Werewold Women of the SS' a goofy funny movie in the vein of the Ilsa/SS type directed by Rob Zombie. Then 'Don't' which is more a mockery of previews of the 70's. Then a preview for 'Thanksgiving' a twisted little trailer with a awesome but ridiculously deep voice-over and some great graphic violence. 'Death Proof' is the weaker of the two movies here and features your standard Tarantino elements: ugly and trashy females, Venessa Ferlito being the only exception here, some funny ebonics talk, girlpower thematics, overlong semi-witty dialogue about nothing particularly interesting. The stars in this movie are the cars, a trinity of Mustang, Nova, and Challenger. Unfortunately, the last two don't fare too well. Kurt Russell gets a thankless role as the bad guy. Seriously, Quentin need to get some therapy to get over his daddy issues. There may have been a time when skinny chicks beating guys to death may have been cool, but thanks to Alias, the Decent, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, High Tension, etc. etc. the whole violent girly 'hero' thing is getting seriously annoying. We get it Hollywood, you're trying to overcome your biblical patriarchal days by engineering a matriarchy. Enough already. In any case, 'Death Proof' is made of 2 mostly unconnected episodes of Kurt Russells character going after a bunch of females with his death proof car. In the first episode at a bar, Kurt's Stuntman Mike character engages 3 females in conversation about his job, one of them, Rose McGowan, will end up taking a ride with him. She doesn't last long. At the same bar, 3 females we met earlier are having drinks with some guys. One of this girls was put up by her friends to give the first guy a lapdance who recites a poem. Mike does it but we don't know if he gets a lapdance due to missing reels in the film. The 3 girls leave the bar and Mike takes revenge on them. The second episode features 4 even uglier females who work in the film industry who end up taking a Dodge Challenger for a test-drive. 2 of the girls are super tough stunt-chicks, wouldn't you know, who end up performing some silly stunt on the Challenger. Out of nowhere, Mike re-appears to terrorize these girls as well. But this time around he's met his match. These girls are tough and mean and don't take no crap from a man, you know. But they don't hesitate to leave their girly female friend at the mercy of the hillbilly owner of the Challenger. What ever happens to her we don't know. The movie never bothers to tell. What saves this movie somewhat is the great car chases and some nice bare feet. After listening to these broads babbling for hours, we eventually get to hear nothing but the roaring of V8s, what a pleasure! Tarantino has to be the only director in Hollywood who finds women attractive and we get some nice shots of feet, legs and butts. But where's the nudity? These movies are supposed to take us back to the days, of cheap thrills, ultra violent blood soaked movies filled with nudity. I sure hope that the DVDs will have some more as it's known that the MPAA loves violence but hates naked women. I very much admire and appreciate the spirit in which Grindhouse was made. It just didn't go far enough. Too much is cosmetic here, the scratches and hair on the film. The coloring, the themes, the look, the misogyny- all should have been there as they were in the old days. These are still contemporary movies they are just made to look old. Tarantino gets in the way of himself here. His movies are too much of him, so whether they are supposed to be horror, action, drama, they are kinda the same. And Quentin, c'mon, you can hire the most gorgeous women in Hollywood, yet why do we keep getting these ugly hags? For someone who claims to be a black guy in a white man's body, the one thing you're missing in your afro-blood is good taste in women. To the Weinstein creeps, Eli and Quentin, and whoever else has some gonads in lalaland, please produce 'Thanksgiving'- that could be the movie that these two should have been. I say, give us a Machete-Thanksgiving double feature in 08!",8,1,4,9 April 2007
Mama," Doesn't quite fulfill its potential
","Some businessman goes crazy, kills his business partner, goes home, kills the wife, takes his two daughters with him. They crash down a snowy hill and walk in the woods till they find some abandoned hut. He tries to kill himself but doesn't have the guts so he decides to kill his older daughter instead but something grabs him.Years later, his brother still pays folks to look for his nieces. He is somewhat of a loser, drawing cartoons while his girlfriend is a bass player in a band. Eventually the girls are found and handed to him for custody, although some rich aunt of the girls wants them too. The girls are wild and underdeveloped, especially the younger girl. They do all sorts of creepy stuff at home. Not long after, a ghost has followed them home, a ghost they call Mama. It lives in walls or in large moths. At some point the guy flies down the stairs and ends up in a coma. With him gone this movie is basically all about the ladies- surprise, surprise.There is some psychiatrist treating the girls who discovers the secret of Mama, she was a nun who had a kid and pursued by the town jumped down a cliff. This movie tries to explain a lot regarding the ghost but fails to explain why she terrorizes people. One good explanation ends up being discarded for some reason. It is a surprisingly scary movie and has a few good jump-out-of-your-seat moments. Chastain's character is excellent, a true rockers chick that doesn't care all that much but will go through a transformation. Chastain herself looks lovely here. The performances are very strong in particular of the older girl, Megan Charpentier. Direction is good but flawed. The look is of your typical Spanish ghost story- overly gray. With this cast and crew and the good basics of a story a lot more could have been done and better.",6,1,3,30 January 2013

Rocky, her daughter, and Money have dreams of moving from Detroit to...where else...California, it's not like there any other states in the union... Alex is key to their operation. His dad works at a home security company and has files on the homes and for some reason even keys, which Alex then uses to break into the homes. He also knows about the law and the punishments for all crimes. They steal only objects but no cash. They then sell the stuff on the cheap to some guy in a van.Money comes up with their next score. A blind Army vet who received a multi-million dollar settlement from some rich family whose girl killed the vet's daughter. He lives in a house in a neighborhood full of abandoned houses. When they scout the place, they discover he's got a Rottweiler. Alex doesn't like the idea, because they don't steal cash, but of course eventually agrees.They drug the dog, find all windows barred, and 4 locks on the main door. Rocky has to squeeze in through some small window. Now they are all in. The plan is to gas the guy to sleep, while they look for the money. They find a heavily-locked door. But then the guy shows up. He fights with Money and kills him. The vet doesn't realize the other two are still there. By luck Rocky discovers the location where he keeps the money. They have no choice but to escape through the basement, through the locked door. In the basement they discover something that changes our view of the vet completely. By now, the vet, who doesn't have a good sense of hearing smells the two and starts going after them, shooting and violently beating them up. The dog by now also also woken up. What follows is almost non-stop action as the movie resolves who, if anyone, gets to survive this.The movie starts with a little intro by the director thanking the audience for watching it. I thought that was pretty cool. Don't Breathe is one tense horror movie. And to its credit it manages to maintain the tension nearly to the very end. Of course, character development isn't what this movie is about. And this scenario where for most of the movie the characters can't communicate makes for a difficult movie for the audience to connect. But Levy and Minnette make it work. They are likable criminals. And Lang stands out as the blind but buffed and trained vet both vulnerable and threatening. The story could have easily stayed at that but it gives us more with the revelation in the basement. Kudos also to the filmmakers for letting the dog survive which rarely happens in movies. Don't Breathe then has to rely on sounds and cinematography to keep the audience involved and it succeeds remarkably well.Up to this point, 2016 has been an awful year for horror movies. Don't Breathe is the strongest one so far excelling for its relentless tension.",8,3,7,11 October 2016
Sicario," Very thrilling
","An FBI team raids a house in Arizona. They expect some type of hostage situation instead find more than 40 bodies stashed in the walls. When an agent opens a hatch in the ground he's blown to pieces by a bomb. When the two main agents in charge, Macer and Wayne (played by two Brits because, why bother hiring an American girl and an African-American when you can hire two Brits to play Americans?!? Just what sick Hollywood agenda is this supposed to satisfy?), are debriefed, it turns into a job interview for the girl, Macer. Some cool and casual but shady government character wants her on his anti-drug taskforce. The girl agrees not knowing what she's getting herself into. She's dropped off at an airport where she gets on a private plane. Aside from the guy, Graver, there's an even shadier Latin guy whose name we don't learn for a while. He has some type of flashbacks.They arrive in El Paso where she thinks the operation will take place. Instead there are sheriffs, marshalls, SEALs, and other operatives. The mission instead will be to drive to Juarez and grab a guy who is in custody there. Off they go and pick up the guy, a relative of the biggest drug lord. As they return over the bottled-up border bridge they spot some suspicious guys and decide to shot these guys up in the middle of the bridge. Macer is outraged, even though she, too, had to kill a guy. And she learns that Graver used her all along for his purposes. The shady Latin guy gets to have the final off-the books interview with the bad guy. Now the team plans a double operation, to go after the bad guy's finances by interrupting some of his deposits in the US. This will cause him to call his brother to Mexico. They plan on using him to find where the main guy is hiding and plan a distraction by attacking one of the smuggling tunnels. Things go well, and Mercer learns that the Latin guy has her back. They time the tunnel operation to coincide with the brother's trip across the border. During the operation Mercer learns that the shady Latin guy is again doing violent things off the book. ****Spoilers follow**** She's outraged and threatens Graver who decides to come clean. The Latin guy is actually Colombian. The drug lord had his wife beheaded and his daughter burn to death in acid. He's going after him and in a way the CIA is facilitating this, it's a win-win situation. Sicario is among my favorite thrillers, right there with Heat and Spartan. It in a way captures the excitement of those two movies and as with them the fantastic music highlights the tension. Aside from the two pointless Brits, casting is strong. Del Toro, even though he doesn't get to say much steals the show as the menacing yet humane...operative/adviser/whatever his character is. Brolin does a solid job and it's great to see Jeffrey Donovan, basically as Michael Westen back in the fold. While for a good time it seems this movie is just about presenting a couple of tense operations, eventually a plot develops and ideas are provided. The more provocative idea is that the US government preferred the days when Escobar's cartel was the sole drug organization around the world. Instead now it's all chaos and all it can hope for is a bit of order. The far less original idea is this standard but unrealistic picture of the FBI as the law-abiding entity while the CIA is all full of rogue and dark operatives. Otherwise Sicario is a terrific thriller.",10,3,8,19 October 2015
The Descent," Good, but...
","The good-- plenty of gore, good creature effects, the instensity, the claustrophobia, some shocking, surprising, and outstanding death scenes; apparently there's some story twists here and there. The bad-- no full-frontal female nudity; unattractive cast; excessive loud sound effects; indistinguishable characters, even though some folks have pointed out that the lighting is supposed to help us identify the characters, not even that works; no male characters; the telling of the story is hindered by the annoying English accent that is undeciphrable, unless you're used to it, you're going to feel like Sledgehammer listening to the Scottland Yard guy; unrealistic premise, are we supposed to believe that these women hike and climb into caves without guidance, communication, or male companions. Yeah right. The ugly-- anti-male sexism. When the director said that this movie was to be a horror movie for women he immediately made it clear that he doesn't care for his male audience, that is, the the people who make up 98% of horror movie fandom. I was offended by that. Luckily, as the dismal box office for this movie shows, female movies goers are normal and healthy and don't fall for this nonsense- they happen to want to see strong male characters. This is the second movie this year, after Silent Hill, that makes the point of not having males in it. What the hell is the matter with these people? For decades now Hollywood has been trying to work toward a global matriarchy by making males the buffoons and the butts of all jokes, while the women are the wise, smart, witty, strong, aggressive characters. So that's their BS political agenda of girl power and helping the supposedly once oppressed. Fine, I'm getting used to that since it's so transparent and it's part of the self-hatred of psychotic Hollywood homosexual males. But that European directors, Cristoph Gans and now this Marshall guy are taking sick ideologies of hatred to the max by making movies sans males is incomprehensible and reproachable. I was planning on not seeing this movie as male fan of horror but after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews I decided to see it, knowing full well that I would be exposed to this sexism. This movie, just like Dog Soldiers, is overrated. They are good, but not THAT good. I suspect that most of the glowing positive reviews are by Hollywood/media psychopaths who fully support the extermination of men from the media.",7,1,4,16 August 2006
Jack Reacher," A thrilling thriller
","A sniper kills 5 random people. Fingerprints lead the police to the shooter, some army guy who doesn't say anything when interrogated but requests someone named Jack Reacher. And surprise surprise Jack shows up. He tells the guy's public defender that he knows the sniper who committed crimes while deployed, killing an armed forces team that engaged in serial rape. Reacher himself was also armed forces but went off grid when he returned.During transport the suspect is beaten into a coma and can't sat anything. Jack starts investigating. At a bar he's approached by a girl and her brothers threaten him. He beats them all up. Jack knows that the girl was planted and that the goal was to take him out. Jack is also being followed wherever he goes. Meanwhile we learn a bit about the villains and the main guy, some former Siberian prisoner who chewed his frost bitten fingers off to avoid gangrene. Jack's only lead is the girl and through her he finds some other guys who try to kill him. Then the girl is killed. Jack and the defender realize there's someone on the inside tipping off the bad guys and that the suspect is innocent after all. The defender looks into the victims and realizes they're not that random after all. Jack of course reached the same conclusion somehow. He looks and finds one of the suspect's friends. It all ends in a confrontation in an office near a mine.I haven't read the book so I can't compare the movie to it. The movie is very good, the story intriguing and interesting. Jack as an investigator seems to have sixth sense for things. And he's also physically unbeatable. Yet played by Cruise he doesn't want him to appear invincible or invulnerable. Cruise also plays some things for laughs and you can almost see him grinning on the inside. He creates a good chemistry with his leading ladies and it's no different here with Pike. As with most complex and mysterious stories, there are some potholes and unanswered questions. Still the resolution is satisfying albeit unnecessarily physical. Some interesting things are said about war but the movie doesn't go deeper. Jack Reacher is a thrilling movie that has strong franchise potential.",8,4,6,29 June 2014
In Time," Outstanding
","How do you get a society completely ignorant of social injustice- at best, or enabling cheerleaders of it- at worst, to become aware? Perhaps by presenting an allegory of it. A society where money has been replaced by time. If time is money, then money is also time. In In Time, time is the new currency. Your work is paid in units of time. You pay for things in time units you have earned. If you run out of time, you die.Just as in real life, in this movie, society is divided into classes, the haves and the have-nots. Those who don't have time are constantly facing death, having to fight for it, borrow it, steal it, pawn things for it. The 'rich' have centuries to live, without aging past 25. They have so much time, they have nothing to do with it. They live leisurely, while those who come 'from time' are constantly in a hurry, a life racing against the clock implanted in their arms. The poor are convinced that there isn't enough time to go around. Those who basically live in eternity, the bankers of time, so to speak, have rigged the system and allow only breadcrumbs of time to make it to the poor areas, while in reality, there is so much time, no one needs to die. They also constantly toy with the 'price' of things so that the poor are always on the brink of dying. It's a world of hyperinflation, where prices double from one day to the next for no good reason- not unlike gas prices in our world.Salas, our main character is from the lower class and lives with his mother. On the day of her birthday he wants to meet her after work but she runs out of time and dies. Salas then meets someone who has more than a century to live. He reveals to him the secrets of their world- the corruption of society that convinces them of the lie that they live in a zero-sum game, that for someone to get time, someone else has to lose it. Before he commits suicide, he gives Salas all his time, who then goes to the rich time zone. But he is pursued by law enforcement- the time keepers who ensure that not too much time escapes into the poor areas.Unfortunately from there, In Time turns into something of a Robin-Hood type action movie, where Salas converts a rich girl into joining him in his fight against the evil time plutocrats (chronocrats?) and against the time keepers who are always on their tail.In Time looks pretty neat, stylish and bleak. The cars are spectacular, combining classic design with futuristic features. Performances all around are OK. But it's the script that shines. It's astonishing how much our language uses the word 'time' and once time becomes the currency, many common phrases take on a startling meaning. The premise is quite brilliant. It translates injustice and makes it so much more poignant, these days that we are downright anesthetized to the sickening corruption of banks and financial institutions.",8,0,0,2 July 2012
Zombieland," Somewhat smart, relatively funny, but no horror
","After watching the previews and the first couple of seconds, I really wanted to dislike this movie: another zombie comedy, narrated by a neurotic geek (yet not a New Yorker), who looks like he's wearing some ridiculous wig. But not long after that I started to enjoy this movie. It has the best opening credits scene in a while, thanks in part to a great Metallica song. Then we meet the narrator: the overacted geek, with countless neuroses (why are there no mentally healthy people in movies?)- even before the world turned to Zombieland. Now that all of the world is filled with zombies, he's even more neurotic.The initial scenes are all tasteless bathroom humor- literally. Then he tells us how the world changed for him and what he's doing now. He's by himself walking on a highway on his way to his parents' place in Ohio. He runs into a complete jerk on his way to Florida. This guy is somewhat sadistic in his treatment of zombies, likes to destroy things, and is on a mission to find Twinkies.They join forces begrudgingly and head East. Twice they are fooled by teenage girls into giving them their weapons and cars. Then they all agree to drive to...darn California of course- can't have a movie without that.That's when the movie goes downhill fast. They decide to live in a mansion and for the next 15 minutes a Bill Murray adoration piece follows that makes no sense. Finally, the girls decide to go to their destination: some amusement park. The geek by then has of course fallen in love with the older girl and has so to go after her. In a bizarre filming mistake, the girls leave in the morning and get there at night, when the guys go after them they get there in 2 minutes. So now it's dark of course and the girls are attacked by zombies while they are trying to enjoy the park all for themselves.What I liked about this movie: despite dangerously close to annoying, the script is smart. The jokes aren't just punchlines. There is some cultural criticism here as well. Who are really the zombies? Most of us 'alive' actually live like zombies pretty much. Another positive is that there was no multicultural cast just for the sake of being politically correct. There are some good zombie kills. There's some good gore, at least in the beginning. The first part filmed in Gorgia (as Texas and Arizona) is good: outdoors in the country, in daylight.The problems with this movie: the cast, especially the weirdo lead character with the wig, who hired these people and why? I don't care for Harrelson a bit, let alone the whole Murray deal. Enough with the neurotic characters already. Tough teenage girls? we've seen that a couple of times too many. The second part taking place in California, in the dark, is like a different movie entirely, and not nearly as good as the first part. It would be perfectly fine to have a horror movie without a conclusion at night. There is zero sense or fear or dread in this movie.Overall, it's a different, refreshing comedy- and that's really what it is- a romantic comedy perhaps, set in Zombieland, where only 5 humans have survived. Visually there are a lot of interesting elements here. While overall, the script follows the basics of all scripts, there are a lot of intelligent bits here and there.",9,2,6,7 October 2009
American Made," Serious fun
","Barry Seal is the youngest pilot at TWA in the 70s. He's recruited by the CIA to do risky low altitude flights over Central America and take pictures of Soviet training camps. He succeeds and that helps his handler and himself. Now he's also tasked with delivering payments to Panamanian strongman Noriega in return for intel on the communists. Seal eventually catches the attention of the Medellin cartel who want him to transport cocaine to Miami. He instead suggests and convinces the cartel that dropping of shipments over Louisiana is better. He continues to do well on both fronts. The CIA buys him a huge piece of land in Arkansas including airport and Seal expands the drug transport operation. Once a leftist government is elected in Nicaragua, the CIA in its usual harebrained thinking process decides to repeat its mistakes and arm some guys claiming to be rebels. It's Seal's job to transport the weapons to the Contras. But of course these guys aren't interested in fighting someone else's war. The CIA then decides to train the rebels in the US and again Seal is tasked with the human trafficking. But the Nicaraguans would rather run away in the US than get trained. The cartel wants in on the action so it gets Seal to fly the weapons to Colombia instead.In the process Seal amasses a huge fortune that he buries in his backyard, fills up his mansion, deposits in banks all over Arkansas. Presumably the rest of his crew also does well so much so that suddenly Mena, the small town in Arkansas, becomes filled with banks. This eventually catches the attention of the FBI, ATF, DEA who arrest him. But the judge, after getting a call from governor Clinton lets him go in exchange for services he can provide to the government. It wants him to produce pictures tying the Central American communists to Colombian drug lords. Again, Seal delivers, but one of the pictures is leaked by someone to the press, a picture that shows him too. Now that Colombians, who have proven that they able to get to people in the US, know that they've been deceived by Seal and will try to get him. American Made is a strong action light comedy of the rise-and-fall of corrupt guy. Direction, editing, and music follow the Scorsese pattern to some extent. For the most part we are spared the family drama though but still, we get too much Cruise and not enough anyone else, especially the lovely Sarah Wright. Cruise overdoes his usual light-hearted approach; no matter the situation, he's nothing but smiles throughout the entire movie keeping things lighter than they need to be given the serious issues involved. But it's the story (and Wright) that shines, which is based to some extent on reality and the strange turns that Seals life take. Overall, a highly entertaining movie.",8,0,1,10 January 2018
The Witch," Great movie
","A Puritan family is booted off the island, or in this case off the Puritan plantation. Now they are in dire straits by themselves on their dry little farm. One day the baby son suddenly vanishes basically right in front of the teen daughter's (Thomasin's) eyes. We see that a witch puts him to sinister use. The father thinks that a wolf took the baby.We learn that the father isn't particularly good at anything but chopping wood and being pious. That forces the early teen son to man-up to to speak. For some reason they don't seem to be able to plant anything and have to make do with three goats, two white ones and a black one. The mother doesn't also do much but complain to god and dream of going back to England. At some point the father sold a silver cup that belonged to the mother's father, something that he doesn't disclose to her.Their two strange toddlers are a little creepy and talk to the black goat and even sing its praises! One day in jest, Thomasin threatens the unruly kids pretending to be a witch. One night the son decides to leave at night with the horse and dog to find food to avoid the family's decision to sell Thomasin away to work for someone else. Thomasin comes along. The dog off course ends up dead, the horse runs away, and the kid is seduced by a beautiful woman. Later he appears at the farm naked and ill. He's somewhat possessed and this pushes the family to the limit. The kids accuse Thomasin of being a witch, which the mother quickly believes, Thomasin throws the father's uselessness in his face. The day after the kids are forced to spend the night with the goats, things have a bloody unraveling. And we learn why the movie is called 'The Witch.' The Witch is a lovely atmospheric even claustrophobic little movie written and directed with subdued confidence and charm. It sets a great tone with the accented overly pious language but the obsession the God and scripture does get tiring after a while. It's supposed to be an independent movie but it eagerly follows the standard Hollywood political agenda. The father's incompetence is just too unrealistic, so is the overly democratic household. Things improve markedly from the monotony once things unravel and the two final revelations regarding the goat and the witch raise this movie several notches in quality and leave one with a very favorable impression of the movie as a whole. The Witch is original in a very good way.",8,1,4,8 November 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," Underwhelming if not disappointing
","Zero Dark Thirty has a lame beginning- a couple of minutes of 911 calls during 9/11. The ending is lame too. What happens in the 2:40 hours in between isn't all that different.For the first hour we experience nothing but CIA failures. And it puts our main character, Maya, in the center of every significant event during several years. But there is one bright spot- a clue about one of Osama's couriers, a clue obtained through torture.During the next hour we see the CIA follow this clue as it gets them closer and closer to the courier. We also see some mild intra agency politics and war of wills. Nothing spectacular but the aim here is to glorify our heroine as the sole genius in the agency.The last 30 minutes or so the order is given to go ahead and attack Osama's compound and we witness the operation. But not even that is remotely as thrilling as it should be. It's a very slow operation, performed not by the best of teams but by a goofy bunch of soldiers motivated solely by--get this--Maya's confidence! When it's all over, you are left with very little.A lot could have been done with this story. The filmmakers chose to do nothing with it. Sure there is the issue of torture, but what is the message? We are shown some scenes of torture light, performed by some agent with a PhD who cares more about the life of some monkeys he plays with. And the actor who plays him has one hell of a time properly articulating his lines. Even though we are told that this isn't some Obama propaganda film, that is belied by one scene were agents are talking during a televised interview of candidate Obama during which he says that waterboarding is torture and there will be no more torture. I guess in Hollywood drone bombing is better than waterboarding. Then the director shows countless scenes during the raid where the soldiers kill women and children, and once dead shoot them again. Why? What's point of focusing on that so often? And what's the point of centering the movie on this Maya character (other than Hollywood's favorite pet project- grl power)? She is everywhere but doesn't do a whole lot. Why is the team that is assigned the Osama operation portrayed as a bunch of dummies? With this story, they could have made a thrilling patriotic action movie, or a sober and serious movie critical of certain policies. Zero Dark Thirty does neither. It's a slow, lazy, pointless movie that doesn't ask tough questions let alone provide answers.",5,6,16,30 January 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Decent mild action movie
","At some point in the future aliens invade earth. They fly like meteorites through space but are more like organic versions of the mechanical aliens in The Matrix--multi-legged octopus creatures of incredible speed and strength.Human have created some tacky exoskeleton made of old rusty parts with weapons attached for their soldiers to wear. Like most other amazing military weapons they are a scam as they don't give humans much of an advantage. Oddly enough humans will only shoot bullets at these aliens even though they seem to be almost resistant to bullets. Part of the military PR campaign is some tough chick and some guy named Cage who appears on all the talkshows. In good neocon fashion, humans can only think of responding to the alien invasion with human boots on the ground in a huge military response in Europe. And Cage who is just a PR guy finds himself being sent to the frontlines. He protests, is tasered and wakes up on the base as they prepare for tomorrow's attack.He meets the tough Master Sargent, is assigned to the J squad where he meets a sorry ragtag bunch of British soldiers. The squad dropped off on the beach for the assault but it's a massacre as the aliens knew that the humans were coming. He manages to survive a few minutes unable to make his armor work, runs into the tough chick who's killed, but then somehow he kills an alien, one that is a different color than the rest and who communicates with them. He's covered in the the alien's blood and his face sort of dissolves.Then he wakes up again on the base as they prepare for tomorrow's attack. But he remembers what he's been through. He relives the attack but is quickly killed and wakes up on the base again. This happens a couple of times as he tries to save people he knows will be killed. Or then he tries to warn the Master Sargent about the slaughter in the hopes he'll stop the offensive. Nothing works. One time though when he meets the tough chick she tells him to meet her when he wakes up. And he does. She of course doesn't recognize him but he explains to her what is going on with him. Turns out she had the same condition but it went away. She introduces him to some weird scientist (as they all are in the movies) who explains how the aliens work. Eventually Cage will start having visions of the alien brain and its location so they can kill it. For that to happen though he will have die repeatedly to be able to get close to the location. And that is where this movie is headed then.Edge of Tomorrow combines familiar elements into an entertaining action movie with lots of humor. The repetition of the days, which usually can be annoying in movies, is actually enjoyable except for long, weird, and pointless scenes of Cruise undergoing training by the chick to shoot at and run from mechanical alien replicas. Cruise is his usual defacing and masochistic self. Blunt is completely forgettable, not sure what they see in her. For an action movie there isn't a lot of action and it's not at all impressive. It's still hyper action, fast, inscrutable stuff flying around. The aliens are lame and don't do anything other than kill and destroy (kinda like humans I guess). Edge of Tomorrow is an enjoyable and milder action movie.",7,0,2,8 October 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Entertaining but empty
","Jordan Belfort arrives in Wall Street and gets a job selling stocks over the phone. The environment is vulgar, brutal, ruthless. One of the senior guys takes him to lunch and gives him the lessons to survive. The main point is to put money from the customers in their pockets, not so much enrich their customers.When Black Friday hits, Belfort is out of a job, and ends up working at a company of amateurs selling penny stocks. He does so well that he ends up opening his own firm ripping people off. He hires friends and shady characters. One of them introduces him to drugs. They are so wildly successful that they pretty much don't know what to do with all their money. He becomes addicted to money, power, and all drugs he can get his hands on. His wife divorces him and he marries the gorgeous Naomi.As the feds start snooping around his business, which involves everything illegal under the sun, he decides to move his money to a Swiss bank and Naomi's English aunt helps in the process as well as various carriers who transport millions of cash by hand. Eventually, the government catches up with him as his life unravels.The Wolf of Wall Street is your typical Scorsese 'rise and fall of a bad guy' movie. It's a bit different in so far as Belfort is nowhere near as likable as the other Scorsese main characters. Here you are not wishing for Belfort to escape and get away. You want him to face justice. And violence has been replaced with comedy. Much of this overlong movie is made up of comedy skits basically. There's DiCaprio on drugs, DiCaprio having deranged sex, there's DiCaprio fooling his wife into doing naughty things in front of a hidden camera, there's the company jerks throwing little people at a target, etc, etc. This movie could have easily been cut by at least half an hour. There's also not nearly enough drama.Most disappointing is the lack of any sort of moral message, if you will. It shouldn't have been difficult to point out the insane misantrophy of Wall Street folks. But there's only very little of that. Given that the finance world still gets away with murder, or perhaps these days even more so, it's not clear why Winter, Scorsese, the producers, anyone, was not interested in taking the opportunity to scold the finance world.Acting is OK. DiCaprio is strong except for the scenes where he's motivating his employees. There are too many scenes of those and DiCaprio doesn't convey the charisma necessary. Margot Robbie is the revelation here. I'm not crazy about the rest of the cast- Hill in particular doesn't convince.Like all stories about larger than life personalities written by themselves, much probably didn't happen as told. Nevertheless and despite the excessive lengthy, Wolf of Wall Street is entertaining yet surprisingly and unnecessarily superficial.",8,6,10,22 January 2014
Inception," Can't share the enthusiasm for this movie
","American cinema continues its discovery of philosophy. The Matrix translated Plato to the screen, Inception does it with Descartes. While you are having a vivid dream, you cannot tell you are dreaming. Unless you are organizing an inception- getting into people's dreams to steal a secret. Usually it would be done for unsavory purposes, but here's it's done for good- I guess. DiCaprio's character aims to implant an idea, rather than steal one, in a young well-to-do man who just inherited an empire. And this is good because monopolies are bad and the fellow who benefits from this is a competitor of the young man. DiCaprio gets out of this a clean record with the US government to enter the country and see his children. How a Japanese businessman can take care of such an issue with a simple phone call is just one of the things the viewer better not worry about in this film.Comparisons with The Matrix are in order here as there are some structural similarities- metaphysical puzzles, high-octane action, but The Matrix is by far the superior film. Inception begins with a scene taking place in archaic Japan to introduce us to the characters. But that beginning didn't work for me at all. Neither did the ending- a ludicrous shoot-out scene somewhere on snow-covered mountains. While The Matrix thoroughly explains itself, Inception deals with the puzzles of internal logic that arise by...ignoring them. While the action in The Matrix is cutting-edge, spectacular even by today's standards and still influences movies today (like Inception and the bullet-avoiding Agent Smith copy of a villain in the awful Resident Evil IV), the action in Inception is lame. There are are two neat visual elements here, the city folding upon itself, and the gravity-defying hotel room scene and fight- again the fight is reminiscent of the final battle in Matrix III.A dreadful side story involves the personal life of DiCaprio's character- and he's pretty much the only one about whom we find out anything in this movie. Everyone else doesn't matter-unfortunately. Because far more interesting and mysterious is the character of DiCaprio's sidekick Arthur. What's his deal? What is he about? We're never told. Instead we are treated repeatedly to DiCaprio's ex who starts out as a seriously odious villain who ruined the movie every time she showed up but then becomes more of a victim and still ruined the movie.Oddly enough there aren't a lot of ideas be gained from this movie. The on intriguing idea was that wealthy people could be protecting their subconscious with some training to avoid revealing corporate secrets. And the entire hotel scene really carries this movie. It's delightfully tense and exciting. That excitement is in part accomplished with a genius soundtrack consisting of nothing but the same low trumpet note played over and over again.The performances are good, except for Watanabe. I couldn't understand a word he said, his lines should have been re-recorded by someone else. On the other hand we have Ellen Page who gets a thankless role as 'the architect' (The Matrix had one, too). She just gets to hang around with the other guys as the go on their adventures. But can this girl ever act! And she is absolutely gorgeous. She acts the hell out of every word she says, endowing the most trite lines with such meaning and depth that she had me hanging on her every syllable. What a performance that she gives with a near meaningless role.Inception is a solid, above-average thriller with too many faults to make it exceptional: pathetically poor character development, sorry action scenes, annoying romance issues. The only exceptional part of Inception is Ellen Page's performance.",7,1,5,25 September 2010
Arrival," Great philosophy, good sci-fi, atrocious drama
","Some language professor named Louise is visited by some military guy after 12 alien spaceships arrive and hover a couple of yards above ground on different places around the world like Montana, Russia, China, Venezuela.He presents her with some recording of the alien language and asks her what she makes of it. Of course she doesn't make anything of it. He leaves planning to visit some other professor. Eventually she's hired for the gig of deciphering the alien language together with with scientist Ian.Up the spaceship they go toward something like a large window. On the other side is fog/mist. Eventually 2 aliens appear. Humans call them heptopods for their seven legs. After the aliens warm up to our team, they release some foggy black ink that turns into shapes. The humans conclude it's their actual language not the sounds they make. The shapes are mostly rings with various blots in different places and eventually the humans more or less figure out the what they mean.At first the humans from the 12 countries are working together. But since all these countries are run by neocon nutjobs who are ready to wage war at any moment, things get more complicated. Info is leaked to the media about what happens during the encounters with the aliens.At some point the aliens appear to write the word 'weapon.' That makes China go crazy and cooperation between the countries is stopped altogether. The US military too takes more aggressive steps. That's when our team goes rogue and give the aliens one more chance. The alien releases a bunch of these ink circles and Louise has to figure out what it means. All throughout the movie she's been having dreams/visions of her daughter and those will be key to figuring out what's going on.Arrival starts and ends with some preposterous pompous music. Fortunately, throughout the movie we are spared that stuff. The movie looks rather ugly, a very misguided choice by the director. The spaceship is utterly unremarkable inside and out and everything is rather colorless. The aliens too aren't particularly interesting although more about their presence is revealed later on. Unfortunately, the movie centers on this lame and dull woman. Ian's contributions aren't clear. His job is to be the woman's sidekick, the best a male character can hope for in Hollywood these days. Even Forest Whitaker who is a compelling actor isn't allowed to do much.Initially, Arrival is very exciting, up to the point where they meet the aliens. Our main characters aren't in charge, no one is, because what is going on is so much larger than any one person or group of persons. But eventually the excitement subsides as the woman's visions that don't make much sense to us yet, or aren't all that relevant after all, take precedence. Those visions for some reason are filmed in richer color and given a better look.But it's the story here that shines. The symbol for 'weapon' will turn out to have another meaning as well. And the movie makes clear how easy it is to start wars, for something as simple as an equivocation on a word. Time is also a main issue here as the aliens, unlike humans, aren't stuck in the arrow of time but have greater freedom in time. This freedom is granted to them by their language.In the end we learn why the aliens arrive, what they say and mean, what Louise's visions are all about, and how what initially looked like catastrophe--the imminent military response by the world powers--was averted. It's meaningful and insightful stuff. However, I'm not thrilled by how it was presented in some overly-dramatic fashion. In some way the audience is also cheated because in the end the story wasn't told entirely linearly, but that was probably necessitated by the story itself. Still, I think it could have been directed/edited in a different, more interesting way. The story is smarter than most these days, but the tone of the movie is a bit arrogant. The movie thinks it's even smarter than it really is.Arrival is strong movie with a rich intriguing story. It's enlightening but not entirely satisfying. I can't get rid of the feeling that a much better movie could have been made with this material.",7,0,6,6 February 2017
Prometheus," Love the robot and aliens, hate the humans.
","In the intro we see some muscular pale humanoid drinking something and he literally falls to pieces into a waterfall. Flying above him is some giant UFO.In 2089 we meet a pair of scientists who have discovered the same type of ancient drawings all over the world- humans pointing at some collection of UFOs.Then we are aboard the Prometheus, a giant spaceship en route to a planet identified to be the home of man's ancestors. On board are our two scientists and a ragtag bunch of multicultural and foreign characters, one more annoying than the next. There's also a cold hot blonde who pretends to be in charge and very human-like robot- named David, what else. The whole project was funded by some dead billionaire.Once they reach the planet they find some straight road, which can't be a natural occurrence and a mountain with a head on top. Some of these clowns go investigate inside the mountain. David is already proficient in the alien language and starts operating doors and other devices. One of them shows a holographic movie of the giant aliens, called engineers, escaping from something. They find a pile of engineer corpses. Behind another door is a giant head, liquefying vases, black liquid and worms. We learn that David is up to something.He actually infects one of the scientists with the liquid from the room. The scientists have sex, the girl ends up pregnant with a fast growing worm. They bring a head from an engineer corpse to study. It turns out it's a helmet and inside is a humanoid alien head. Meanwhile all hell breaks lose inside and outside the Prometheus.Prometheus is an interesting sci-fi movie I must say. It offers more than just nondescript aliens eating or shooting at people for no good reason- that would be your average sci-fi movie. The sets, the he 'science', the theories, all is pretty fascinating in this movie. At least it tries to tackle the issue of the origin of man and creates an interesting mythology. It offers more questions than answers, which is just as good. Perhaps the answers wouldn't be as satisfying as the possibilities the questions open. Not to mention that they have to leave something for sequels. But it does have some major weaknesses--namely most of the humans, which are annoying, unprofessional, and just plain stupid. It is a mystery how presumably intelligent people-all the writers in Hollywood-can write nothing but dumb and obnoxious characters. This crew might as well be a bunch of reality-TV star wanna-bes in space. Sci-fi is the one genre where writers could get nerdy and show off their smarts. But no. Prometheus does have some good ideas and it provides food for thought, if nothing else it makes you think of all the ways this movie could be better.",7,1,2,10 December 2012
Taken 2," Not convincing
","We meet up with Bryan as he meticulously obsesses and watches over everything involving his daughter Kim- who turned out to be quite the lovely girl. Apparently he still has nothing going on in his personal life. His ex is going through some marital troubles. When he goes to Turkey for work they join him there. Also in Turkey is the dad of one of the bad guys he killed in part 1. The bad guys are already tracking his moves there. When he leaves with the ex, they take him while she escapes. But eventually they take her as well.Bryan, prepared for any eventuality has some mini phone with him that he uses to warn Kim, guide her out of the hotel and meet up. They escape the captors chasing them but he has to go back and get the ex, who of course isn't there anymore. He finds her nonetheless and her captor, the main bad guy.Taken 1 was nothing revolutionary but was quite entertaining despite plenty of weaknesses. Rather than try to improve things, with Taken 2 things go markedly downhill. The positives first. Kim isn't annoying anymore, but rather watchable. Neeson who looked so fragile in part 1 like he was going to fall apart any minute looks healthier this time around and he's also very angry. But he doesn't really get to vent his anger enough. And the times he does, it's filmed so poorly the audience gets nothing out of it. Neeson at all times looks ready to blow up and wreak havoc, but we don't get to experience some cathartic mayhem. As most reviewers have pointed out, how the action is filmed is downright catastrophic for this kind of movie. So at at the end you are left with very little to like. This Olivier Megaton fellow is definitely the one you want to hire if you want to kill an action movie franchise. But decently filmed action still wouldn't have helped the lazy scriptwriting. The long setup at the beginning doesn't really work. It just builds some anticipation to an event that never happens. Aside from impossible aiming skills and a good memory very little is shown of Bryan's special skills. Taken 2 is a wasted opportunity.",5,3,4,27 October 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Another mega Batman movie with Batman missing
","The Dark Knight Rises follows along the lines of The Dark Knight. A superhero movie where the superhero is absent most of the time. Initially Wayne is crippled and recluse and Batman retired altogether. A bit of romantic teasing with a thief/Catgirl makes Wayne come back into the open. When a gang of thieves led by Bane attack the stock exchange, Batman returns to action. The attack bankrupts Wayne enterprises. Alfred resigns, leaving Wayne and Batman pretty much on their own. On top of that the person who Wayne picked to run Wayne Enterprises also turns on him. Then Catgirl deceives Batman and leads him to Bane's trap. As a result Wayne ends up in a prison/mine for another good chunk of the movie. In other words, this is again a Batman movie without much of Batman.Eventually he manages to escape--to rise out of the ground. By then Bane's plan to destroy Gotham is in full gear. And he intends to do so with a Wayne enterprises reactor-turned nuclear bomb no less. By now Batman has hooked up with a young detective who knows about Wayne's past. The lame commissioner is also back. And they all aim to stop Bane's masterplan. This time around at least Batman gets to fly around in some plane-thing.This too is then a convoluted long movie with a lot going on. What interested me the most was the Catgirl angle and Ra's al Ghul's legacy and family tree. The mythology isn't emphasized enough in these movies. Why Nolan's Batman movies are so devoid of Batman I don't get but here we have strong and interesting alternate characters in Catgirl and detective Blake. The problem with our main villain Bane is that he wears a mouthmask making him hard to understand, which makes his villain-speeches far less powerful. Of course he's not the only villain as there is no shortage of bad guys/gals. And a single and mostly absent good guy can't make up for it.",7,2,4,21 June 2016
Mother!," Annoying
","For some reason Lawrence and Bardem are a couple. He doesn't do much of anything, a poet with writer's block--as always in the movies. She in the meantime single-handedly built the mansion in which they live apparently secluded, after a fire destroyed it.One day there's a knock in the door. A stranger arrives who claims to be a fan of the poet. Because there's nowhere else to go, the guy invites the stranger to spend as much time as he needs in the house. There's some mysterious crystal that is the pride and joy of the guy and the stranger quickly wants to see it and touch it. Soon the stranger's wife arrives. And she's just insufferable. Right in the homeowner's face at all times, no filter between her mind and her tongue. She gives her a hard time about not having children. The stranger is seriously sick and a smoker. Then suddenly the two sons of the strange couple arrive screaming, yelling, and fighting over a will. One son kills the brother in the living room. Get where this is going...?For some reason the guy accepts that the funeral reception be at their house. The girl is aghast. Hundreds of people show up and they make themselves right at home. The girl flips out. The guy is delighted at all the sudden life in his house. They fight and have sex. She ends up pregnant and he suddenly finds the inspiration to write. He becomes world-famous. Again the house ends up filled with media, fans and assorted strangers to the disbelief of the heavily pregnant girl. She eventually gives birth and the guy parades the son like some trophy. The crowds go wild. Chaos ensues. Political battles take place inside the house, religious battles. SWAT arrives and it's all against all. The baby ends up being cannibalized by some worshiping crowd. And now the girl decides to put an end to it all.Mother! is a rather infuriating movie. I had to watch it in two one-hour session because I just couldn't take it anymore. The girl is lovely and the camera is on her nearly the whole time. The guy is annoying in his anything-goes aloofness. They don't talk much at all in the two hours. And of course we are limited to this house the entire time. The strangers are insufferable on all levels. Sure, the idea is not bad once you interpret it. And watching a history of humanity unfold in the last 30 minutes is kinda interesting. But for those 30 minutes you have to put up with one and a half hour of nothing. This is one instance where the writer should have taken more time to polish the work and he should have let someone else direct this project. I'm convinced that under another director's vision this movie could have been outstanding. As it is, though it's obnoxious to watch and hard to recommend.",3,1,2,28 February 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Sequel curse sets in
","Some powerful force that was hidden by the Asgardians ages ago is discovered by some kids in England. Jane shows up and is infected by the force. Thor takes her to Asgard and Odin finally reveals what all this is about. The evil Elves who want this force invade Asgard and close all exit portals trapping the gods. By using this force, the Aether, they can destroy the universe and let nothingness rule. That forces Thor and his sidekicks to join forces with the imprisoned Loki. But can they trust Loki? Long CGI carnage ensues between the Asgardians and the Elves, Loki, Thor and the main villain. It's no mystery who wins the battle. We get several instances of Asgardian politics- Thor's insecurity of being the ruler, Loki's ambition, and Odin's wisdom. At the end we're left with...questions to be answered by part 3 I guess.Thor I was beautiful, captivating, fascinating, visually and story-wise. Thor II just falls flat. Almost entirely without charm, it teaches us nothing new about the Norse world. Relationships don't matter here all that much and Loki gets slapped by some girl. It took 3 writers to come up with this weak story that's just there to justify hundreds of millions wasted in dull CGI battles. And what better way to ruin a good thing than by hiring a director with near zero experience in movies and hand him the (formerly) strongest of the superhero franchises so far. Thor II is disappointment. These movies have gone into industrial mode, are being cranked out by the dozen now without regard to quality, anyone who's got time is hired to direct. A shame, but typical greedy cynical Hollywood behavior. Hopefully someone who actually cares will take control of Thor III before they start hiring rappers and Bruce Willis to act, try to sell us some lame soundtrack, and let Thor become a copy of Transformers 8.",5,1,2,4 April 2014
Lucy," Besson, Being, and Time
","Lucy is the name given to the fossil remains of female hominid who lived 3.2 million years ago (the first woman, the movie calls her). Lucy is also the name given to the main character of this movie, the first person to use a greater, much greater, percentage of her neurons.Lucy starts out as some very ordinary girl who for some reason finds herself in Taiwan and dating some hustler named Richard. He begs her to deliver a case for him to a man in a hotel lobby. She's not interested. He handcuffs the case to her wrist, puts $500 down her blouse. Off she goes to ask for Mr. Jang. Next thing, Richard who has been watching from outside is shot and she's dragged away. Jang doesn't speak English and is suspicious. Lucy is forced to open the case. There are bags of blue crystal drug in there. Jang offers Lucy a job. She declines. Next, she wakes up with a scar on her abdomen. She and 3 other guys have been implanted with a bag of the new drug and are supposed to deliver it to the rest of the world.Lucy is placed in a room where she's abused by some guy, she resists, he beats her up. The bag in her abdomen leaks and she's affected by the drug. At first she gains physical strength and other strange powers. She leaves the place after shooting up the bad guys, goes to a hospital to have the bag removed from her body. She notices how her mind and skills are expanding.Parallel to this we meet some scientist named Norman who is giving a speech in Paris about what it would be life for humans to use a greater percentage of their neurons. Lucy calls him showing him her skills. She's living proof of what he's been theorizing about. She tells him she'll see him in Paris. As she travels to Paris she develops the skill to control other people, but mid-flight her body almost vaporizes so she has to inhale the rest of the drug she's carrying with her. She also alerts the authorities about the other 3 mules.In Paris she meets a cop she's been communicating with. They catch the mules and take them all to Paris. She meets the scientists and has no choice but go all the way and take all the drugs and to see what will happen. But, the Asian mobster is also in Paris determined to get his drugs back.Lucy isn't so much about the action. It's...who would have thought...about the ideas. And who would have thought that it would be Besson to come up with a rich philosophical movie, a movie not even about French existentialism but about German metaphysics. The issues covered include--being vs. having, reproduction vs. immortality, matter and energy, and being and time. The science is a bit hokie, but the philosophical ideas are solid. That said, of the philosophical action movies (The Matrix, Inception), this one is the weakest when it comes to the action, the philosophical ideas also, aren't worked out, just hinted.Still, I enjoyed Lucy a great deal. Johansson does a good job. I wasn't crazy about the robot-like acting near the end though. If you catch the ideas and references, the movie gives you a lot to think about. While the movie doesn't quite develop the questions it wants to ask, it comes up with the answer and the answer is indeed philosophically significant.",9,6,15,9 September 2014
RED," Good but not good enough
","Frank is just trying to mind his business. He lives by himself and flirts with a government customer service representative girl over the phone. They decide to meet. Suddenly at night a special ops team is sent to kill him but he wipes them out. He ends up kidnapping the girl, Sarah, for her own good. They continue to be chased by the CIA and its main operative Cooper. Frank meanwhile recruits other retired CIA people to help him out and even an old KGB/FSB agent. They are all too happy to help him.Frank decides he's got to find out what this is all about. A reporter has been writing a story and kept a list of names, all of which but one have been killed. Frank and Sarah break into the secret CIA archive room to recover a file on an operation that Frank and the others were involved in Guatemala. Turns out the vice-president in his youth was in the military and committed some serious crimes in Guatemala and Frank's team cleaned it all up. When the reporter started investigating the story, it was time to clean up the clean-up team. They also go after the one guy left, an arms contractor/dealer that is too valuable for the government to eliminate. Frank decides to mount a complex operation to get the vice president, who is about to announce that he will run for president.Red is somewhat entertaining light action that pretends to be a comedy as well, although there isn't much humor. There is a need for movies like Red that rehabilitate older actors, now that Hollywood has overdone the teen mania for more than a decade. It's time for a generational balance instead of the either/or absolutisms. At the same time, I'm tired of Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman, who are among the few older actors who survived the Hollywood decimation of the aged. It's time to retire these two for good and give others a chance. Not to mention that Willis's skin looks far too artificially smooth for a retiree. The movie's pace is slower which is alright, but somehow production felt it was necessary to subject us to constant obnoxious silly caper music. It's insufferable.A lot of fuss was made about the supposed extreme and surprising violence. Other than two guys being blown to pieces, there's nothing outrageous here or surprising. What is pointless is the fake comedic angle that Hollywood always uses to cloak its violence in or any other disagreeable issues. Red while entertaining also got on my nerves. On the other hand, the lovely Mary-Louise Parker and John Malkovich steal the show and give us a much needed respite from Willis's bald head and expressionless face.",6,0,3,23 September 2013
Flight," Ugly
","Whip is the greatest pilot the universe has ever seen. He's also an alcoholic and a junkie. He's divorced and estranged from his ex and his son. He has a relationship with a flight attendant. One day he has a flight from Orlando to Atlanta with a rookie flight officer. He pulls a dangerous maneuver to get the plane out of heavy turbulence. Later he drinks some more vodka from the trays. Suddenly the elevator gets stuck driving the plane into an uncontrollable descent. Whip decides to flip the plane to regain some control and crash lands it in an empty field saving almost everyone on board. Among the dead, his flight attendant.He ends up relatively unharmed in the hospital. His union representative offers all the support, some goofy NTSB show up for a preliminary interview. First thing he does is call his pusher to supply him with all sorts of goodies. During a smoke break at the hospital stairwell he meets a junkie girl. We've also seen her before, she's down and out on her luck.Whip leaves the hospital to the family farm, gets rid of all the drugs and booze, visits the girl and takes her with him. The union gets him a lawyer that manages to suppress the toxicology report that shows that he was on alcohol and cocaine the day of the flight. He start drinking again. The girl tries to help to no avail. The union tries to help, to no avail. He starts manipulating the surviving crew to testify that he was alright that day. The day approaches when he will testify under oath in front of the NTSB. Will he straighten out or lose it? Flight has a very compelling aircraft crash scene and interesting insights by a terminally ill cancer patient, but it has a lot of uncompelling, pointless scenes, too. And lots of loud obnoxious music. Knowing what we know about Whip, it's impossible to root for this guy in any way. Which leaves you without a character to care for. And frankly this movie features mostly ugliness, drug addiction, and lies. It makes pilots, the airline industry, and the pilot unions look terrible. Performances by secondary characters are particularly strong- Bruce Greenwood, Peter Gerety, James Badge Dale standout, as well as Nadine Velazquez's body. I guess, if addiction is your thing, Flight might be worth looking into. Near the end it finally gives you some meaningful lines. Otherwise, don't be fooled by the cast or the semi-interesting premise, Flight is mostly empty and ugly.",4,2,5,2 February 2014
The Purge," A missed opportunity to make a great movie
","It's a couple of hours before the yearly Purge and a 1%er finds out he's salesman of the year at the home security business. The yearly Purge has been setup by the new founding fathers in the future so there will be no violence during the rest of the year. All crime is allowed. Some families just stay at home and worry, others party, and some people go 'hunting.' While the guy talks about preparing, the family just sits and dines and then 3 minutes before the purge, they go to a room with cameras and lock down their mansion with protective barriers. The kid, the daughter, the mom they all go do their own thing. The kid watches the screens and sees a man screaming for help so of course he's going to open the gates and let a complete stranger in who clearly doesn't look like he belongs in a millionaires' neighborhood.Also in the house is the girl's boyfriend who is older than she is and he wants to talk to the dad. Except that he actually wants to kill him. As a result dad ends up killing him and the stranger vanishes in the house. Suddenly a weird gang of rich kids- male and female with masks show up at the door demanding they release the stranger to them so they can purge. Dad is all for it, mom and the kid aren't, but they still don't know where he is. The party outside is getting antsy and give a deadline. When the deadline passes, they break in the house. By then the dad has changed his mind and won't give them the stranger. Now violence ensues, some neighbors also show up, and the family will try and survive the night.The Purge has a fantastic and original premise. But as many point out, the execution is a letdown. The first 20 minutes are pretty good, then things go downhill until the violence starts. It is of course annoying when movie characters act in completely nonsensical ways, and there's plenty of that in this movie. The second problem is that it focuses on this single family that isn't very rational or likable. It doesn't take long before the lights go out and people use small flashlights. You know, it is entirely possible to make a horror movie during the day or with lights on. Hollywood should try it out occasionally. We even get some dark POV perspective because the annoying kid has build some creepy RC doll-on-a-tank with a camera. There are some surprises and twists later on but the weaknesses are too obvious to overlook. The idea is very very provocative no doubt and it confront America with its penchant for violence. This movie should be exciting, tense, edge-of-your-seat stuff--but it just isn't. Hopefully in The Purge 2 the writer/director will address these shortcomings.",6,0,0,12 January 2014
Looper," Excellent
","A looper is a killer for hire. 30 years in the future, time travel will be possible. Future mobsters, to get rid of someone will ship him to the past where a looper waits, shoots the person and disposes of the body.One such looper is Joe. He's young but acts as if he's old and very experienced. He practices French, steals money from his bosses, is addicted to a drug called hope and has a relationship with a prostitute. Suddenly a new bad mobster in the future known as 'the rainmaker' decides to 'close all the loops.' That's when a looper from the future is sent to the present to be killed by their younger self. This is happening to all his colleagues. And eventually to Joe as well, but Joe fails to kill his future self and now there are two Joes out there. And that's when things get interesting. First in mostly fast-forward we learn what happens to Joe in the future. He follows his boss's advice and goes to China where he meets a woman who makes him very happy. Suddenly loopers show up, kill the woman, and send him to the past to be killed.Then we go back to the story of the two Joes. Future Joe has some information on the rainmaker and figures he can put and end to the closing of the loops by killing the rainmaker as a toddler. Young Joe is not interested in that project. He wants to get rid of old Joe.Old Joe has the addresses of three possible rainmaker children and has to eliminate them all. Young Joe knows one of the addresses and waits there. It's a farm were the mom is very overprotective of the boy. Joe and the mom will get closer and he will learn to like them both. What will he do when old Joe shows up? Looper works with a familiar idea in a very original way. Rather than avoid the time travel paradox and its circularity it jumps right into it and makes it the main theme of the movie. On a first glance, the logic seems to work just fine. The key moment is when the lives of both Joes intersect and separate. The movie is also quite funny- there is a lot of physical humor. The action is good even remarkable as when the rainmaker gets angry and starts controlling the environment with his mind. That's because in 30 years from now there are mutants with telekinesis out there. The scenes surrounding the rainmaker in particular are exciting. Unfortunately we know his identity before the movie gets there. That aspect could have been handled better. It should really have been told from the perspective of old Joe and his tracking down of the the three kids. Another problem with this movie is that it tries to inject an emotional tone into the movie that is not suited and doesn't even belong there. For the most part of the movie, it doesn't try to present young Joe as likable or as ethical or as the good guy. On the contrary it's old Joe who is far more likable. But by the end we're supposed to feel more for young Joe. On the other hand, a little bit of romance between the farm lady and Joe is handled very well.Looper is a fresh, original, and exciting movie. At 2 hours it's at least 15 minutes too long. It does have a lot to tell but at times it should have focused on other things. It could easily have been a 10 with some better editing.",9,2,6,11 October 2012
Life," Very exciting
","Some probe that collected samples on Mars returns and docks to the ISS. The scientist there starts feeding a cell found on Mars. It does respond and grow. More cells grow that are like stem cells, they serve several functions and aren't specialized. They each are muscle, nerve, and photoreceptors at once. The little creature does respond initially to touch. At some point it goes into hibernation. The scientist decides to zap it with electricity to wake it. It works, but now the creature that looks like a starfish, is angry, grabs the guy's hand and breaks it. It then devours a mouse nearby. Then it grabs the electrical probe to cut through the glove and now it escapes. Another astronaut, a big mouth American decides to play cowboy and rescue the scientist from the isolated lab. He does succeed with the rescue, but fails in his attempt to burn the alien creature, which is called Calvin. It in turns grabs him, kills him and somehow feeds off him and grows even more right in front of the eyes of the rest of the crew, which now tries to keep the firewall intact. But Calvin escapes to the outside where it survives no problem and destroys the ISS's communications. When the commander does a spacewalk to fix comms, the creature kills her as well.Calvin makes it back inside and terrorizes the rest of the crew. Earth control sends another spaceship to dock to the ISS and push it into outer space because occasionally the ISS falls into decaying orbit threatening to make it to earth. And apparently, as always in these movies, on top of everything, they are short on fuel. The issue here is that no matter what, the martian lifeform cannot make it back to earth. That's also the mission of the English CDC astronaut on board--ensure by any means possible that it doesn't happen.By now, the remaining crew decide to use the escape pods. One to send Calvin to outer space and one to make it back to earth. But only one person can fit in each pod.Life surprised me. I didn't expect such an entertaining and exciting movie. Like most of these space movies at first the camera work is just too orchestrated and annoying in all it's turns and rotations. Eventually once we focus on the story things improve a lot. There's some attempt to give this ultra-multicultural cast of characters some depth, but it didn't really work. Not to mention that I didn't care about any of these people. Calvin steals the show, as a visually fascinating creature, at times beautiful yet menacing. Much of what happens in Life is the usual stuff that happens to characters in sci-fi space movies, nevertheless, it's done so well in this movie that it had me completely involved.",7,0,1,10 October 2017
Heat," An epic masterpiece of modern American cinema
","Heat is among the finest 10 movies ever made. It's a classic. You can watch it nearly 20 years after it was made and it still astonishes you, every time you see it. Heat is a movie I never get tired of seeing.In Heat we follow a very professional tight crew of criminals led by DeNiro's McCauley that specialize in complex high-yield crimes. In the intro crime, they are forced to hire a new guy- Waingro, which will end up being the cause of their undoing. That intro crime is also among the more thrilling crimes ever filmed. It's elaborate, brilliant, fascinating.Tasked with solving the crime will be Pacino's Hanna. And he sure is up to the task, a man just as dedicated to his job as his nemesis. While McCauley is a loner and introvert, Hanna is the loud, at times funny, extrovert- and is he ever an extrovert.Hanna quickly catches up with this crew and keeps track of them in secret. But, McCauley is no dummy and he catches on to the cops, in a scene that is flat out genius.Hanna has unorthodox methods to say the least and one night he decides to invite McCauley for a coffee- leading to the famous face-to-face scene between DeNiro and Pacino. McCauley's character is the coolest criminal ever, and you most definitely don't want to this movie to reach its unavoidable conclusion. But for getting there you are rewarded with the most exhilarating shoot out scene put on film- following the crew's bank robbery in the middle of downtown L.A.Heat succeeds on every level: action scenes- the now legendary shoot out scene; on a personal level- Hanna's marriage falling apart and McCauley finding a girl; it has plenty of memorable funny moments- Hanna visiting Alan Marciano or Albert Torena; the fantastic music- many directors pay attention to their music (Tarantino being a bad example of it) but the score of Heat is perfect; not to mention the casting from the main to minor characters, it now reads as a who's who of Hollywood.What is most remarkable about Heat is the attention to emotional detail. The scene where loner McCauley looks in tenderness and disbelief the next morning at the girl in his bed is outstanding. In general, relationship are handled so well in this movie, in a mature, smart way that's not melodramatic. And the most significant relationship is the indirect one between Hanna and McCauley. They are truly meant for each other. There is a deep reciprocity in their lives. Without brilliant criminals like MacCauley there wouldn't be brilliant cops like Hanna. Hanna is married but the marriage is falling apart; MacCauley is a single and deep down lonely and finds a relationship. But both men aren't meant to live a regular life.Worth mentioning is also the cinematography. This movie looks gorgeous, every scene, every setting, the fashion, the cars. There is an aesthetic sensibility here that is years ahead of the aesthetic focus in movies these days. The tone of this movie, the looks, the music, it's all so understated yet so unashamedly brilliant.What makes this movie unforgettable though are the characters and the script. And there is no shortage of amazing characters. This isn't a movie that depends on one character or where one performance makes the movie. McCauley, the coolest criminal; Hanna the outrageous cop; Waingro, the vicious criminal; one could go on and on. One in particular is interesting because mysterious- Jon Voight's Nate- the man behind McCauley, pulling strings for him. What is his deal? We'll never know. A TV series based on him would have been a great idea. It's a shame that Mann's Robbery Homicide Division TV series never developed into what it could have been, a TV version of Heat.There are good movies, there are great movies, and there are movies like Heat. In a category of their own.",10,2,5,25 August 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Great fun
","After some cool intro credits, some British agents raid a compound in Afghanistan. They grab some guy and tie him to a chair. Suddenly they realize he's got a bomb. One of them throws himself onto to guy as the bomb explodes saving his team mates. One of those on the team, Harry Hart, visits the widow and offers help. She rejects it so he gives the medal to the young son. On the reverse of the medal is a number. If called and given a code, help will be forthcoming.We are taken to Argentinian mountains years later where an environmental scientist has been captured. A suited Brit knocks on the door and wipes out all the bad guys. Someone knocks on the door and suddenly the Brit is cut in half by a girl amputee wearing blades for legs. Oh, no...it's Samuel Jackson at the door...Turns out all these Brits are 'Kingsmen,' a super secret agency of gentlemen. Now that that two of them have died it's time to recruit a new member. At this time, the young kid from the intro is older and in trouble. His mom's new guy is some bad guy who is abusive. One day the kid steal a car and goes for a joyride and ends up in jail. He calls the number on the back of the medal and gives the code. Next thing he knows he's meeting Hart who proposes that the kid get his act together so he sponsors him to join the Kingsmen.What follows is some training and ability tests for several kids to take the one available spot. In meantime, Jackson is up to no good. He's supposed to be a billionaire genius entrepreneur out to save the planet and humanity. He decides to give away free SIM cards for free internet and phone to everyone who wants one. But he's also kidnapping the important, rich, and famous and others he's implanting with a chip behind the ear. The chip allows him cause these people to go completely berserk or to to blow up their heads at the push of a button. He does a test run at a church. Then he announces he will save the planet by eliminating a large part of the population. Now the remaining Kingsmen and the young recruit will have to keep Jackson from following through with his plan.Kingsman is a fantastic action thriller that offers violence and intrigue. It captures the magic long lost by the James Bond movies and also some of the thrilling violence that the early Jason Bourne movies had. Finally we get one such movie that is R-rated. The character of Hart and the acting of Firth are very strong. This character alone has franchise potential. However, the young recruit and the actor playing him are rather weak. Things are perhaps a bit too formulaic--you get the villain in his giant high tech lair with his wicked side-kick and hundreds of soldiers willing to die for him. The movie is a bit too long and the orchestrated Bond-ripped off music is excessively loud and obnoxious. But nonetheless, Kingsmen is a blast of a movie.",9,2,7,18 June 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," Another great chapter
","John Wick goes back to get his car from a Abram, lots of car carnage ensues as Abram sends his minions to get in John's way. Presumably this takes place soon after part 1.He barely gets home in his wreck. He's got a new dog, too. Then Italian mob boss Santino pays a visits. He wants to cash in a 'marker.' That's a medallion with John's bloody finger print. It entitles Santino to a favor which John can't refuse. This is in exchange for a favor that allowed John to retire years ago. Of course John is retired so he does refuse. In return, Santino blows up John's house.John goes to the Continental to have a word with Winston who reminds John about the rules and that he cannot refuse the marker. So John of course reluctantly agrees. The job is to kill Santino's sister who was just promoted to some crime syndicate. He wants her place. In Rome, her induction party is about to take place and John prepares by getting weapons, suits, and studying the maps of the catacombs beneath Rome.John gets the job done, but on his way out he realizes that Santino has turned on him. So he has to make his escape. Santino puts a a price of 7 million on John's head and now every killer in NY is after him. Eventually John has to confront Santino and in the process breaks one of the rules of the Continental which means he's now in serious trouble.John Wick 2 is another great entry in what is among my favorite action franchises. This is serious old fashioned action made up mostly of gun fights and cool choreographed mano-a-mano fights. I can't recall another movie where the sound of gun shots was this satisfying. You can't get enough of it. This movie also has a great villainess in the character of the deaf hottie Ares. This time around we don't learn as much of the working of the secret society of killers. This entry is also a bit long. Nonetheless, fans of action movies shouldn't miss the John Wick movies, they are truly outstanding.",10,1,4,24 February 2017
Annihilation," The Descent 3 sci-fi?
","A meteor crashed into a lighthouse. Then a girl named Lena is debriefed in some facility. The guy doing the debriefing is wearing some hazmat suit. Previously, she was a biology professor mourning her husband who went missing after some military operation a year ago. The day she decides to paint the bedroom a different color he shows up but can't give any explanation and doesn't say much at all. When he starts bleeding he's taken in an ambulance but man in black show up. Next thing we know Lena is in some other facility where she's told what's going on.After the meteor crashed some colorful gooey transparent wall appeared which is expanding over time. They call it 'the shimmer.' Whatever goes through it doesn't come back--except for Lena's husband but he's in a coma now. Running the show is some psychologist for some reason. She's recruiting people for yet another mission through the shimmer. She assembles an all-female cast (in what universe is that cool?), Lena among them of course, she volunteers because she thinks she owes it to her husband. In any case, off they go. On the other side it looks like a normal jungle. Except that eventually they see odd colorful vegetation and mold. Lena concludes it's some mutation. The find a house and are attacked by a crocodile. When they kill it they realize it's also a mutant. Then they are attacked by some bear-like creature. They find the place where the previous group was station. They left a tape where Lena's husband opens up another guy's abdomen to reveal some slithering inside--perhaps the guy's intestines, perhaps something else.Our team notices that something goes on with them as well. One girl's fingerprints move; Lena examines her blood and the cells are mutating. And of course they start going bonkers attacking each other. They find abdomen guy exploded on a wall covered with the colorful mold. Farther away they find plants in the shape of humans. One of the girls comes to a realization. Just as the light reflects, so does everything, including DNA. That's why all the mutations. She does something extraordinary. Instead of wanting to face or fight whatever IT is, she gives up. The plan is to go to the lighthouse, but by now the number of team members is dwindling. Lena of course makes it to the lighthouse, finds another videotape involving her husband and a surprise. She goes through the hole where the meteor landed. Are here the filmmakers didn't shy away from he sci-fi but give us something of an explanation. I won't reveal what goes on but it's pretty fascinating. At the ending there's somewhat of an expected surprise but it's an unsatisfying one because it goes against what we saw earlier.Annihilation is a slower, longer, but satisfying sci-fi movie. They probably could have done more with the mutation aspect in the jungle but fortunately keep the human drama and fighting to a minimum. The final act is intriguing. We even learn some interesting bits of science.",7,0,2,1 April 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," Genius
","The Cabin in the Woods is just the kind of horror movie that has been sorely missing for years. The horror genre tends to play it too safe. There's the slasher era, the torture porn era, and now we're suffering through the awful lost footage era, unfortunately the zombie TV fad never really made it to the movies. Horror and comedy has often been combined and the result has usually been embarrassing. This movie has a bit of comedy and zombies and just breaks through these subgenres to create something fresh and unique. I've been waiting for a movie like this, a movie in the spirit of The Return of the Living Dead, a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but respects the audience.We initially meet some 60s style scientists in some large facility who are taking part in some sort of international contest, the only contenders left are the US and Japan.Suddenly we switch to a group of horror-movie-stereotypical kids. The guy who goes everywhere with a football, the guy who goes everywhere with a bong, the slutty blonde, the pure girl, and the nerdy guy. They're going for a road trip to a cabin in the woods. On the way they meet the stereotypical backward gas station attendant who warns them. Once they get there it all seems nice and fun enough until they go to the cellar, find all sorts of creepy objects among them a book and start reading incantations in Latin from it. Then one of the scientist in control pulls a lever to release the Buckner family- a family of zombies. The zombies go after and kill some of the kids in gruesome ways.When only the virgin is thought to be left, the entire staff at the science project celebrates their victory over Japan. We also get hints of what is behind all this. But it turns out the celebration was premature. The remaining kids not only escape the Buckner family but also make it into the science facility and what they've find there is just wild.The Cabin in the Woods successfully combines plenty of elements/references from other horror movies into something new and unexpected. It succeeds in all its different aspects. The horror element is very well done, with the truly scary zombie family. And these zombies look and act the way zombies should. They don't look like people with some pasty mascara on and don't run around like toddlers on a sugar high. The look more like 80s Italian zombies, the best kind. Skinny, rotten. Well except for a big rotten zombie. The funny bits are truly funny, and our dopey guy gets the funny lines and he sure delivers them well. Acting all around is excellent. Then there is a crazy fantasy aspect to the movie as well as a more serious mythology to it that is interesting. And of course the scientists add a bit of deception and conspiracy. While a sequel would be difficult to make, I sure wouldn't mind some prequels.",9,3,7,23 September 2012
Spectre," An improvement over Skyfall
","In the intro, Bond finds himself in Mexico for something called day of dead celebration which looks like a mix of Mardi Gras, Macy's parade, and Halloween. Bond is going after some guy in a white suit and instead of getting it on with a hottie decides to shoot the guy. He listens in on a conversation this guy has with some others. They talk about an attack on a stadium. When Bond starts shooting he hits a suitcase and it blows up taking half the building down plus some others nearby.After a decent intro credits scene finally with naked girls again but with some pretty weird and out of place song, Bond gets himself on leave for the scandal he caused in Mexico. The 007 program still finds itself on the verge of suspension as security institutions are shuffled around. Wasn't this the storyline of Skyfall? But now a new mega security organization has been created that aims to spy on everyone.The reason Bond was in Mexico is because the former M asked him to go after the guy, kill him, and attend his funeral. The funeral is coming up and Bond has to enlist Q and Moneypenny to help out. He was recently injected with 'Smart Blood' that will track his whereabouts. At the funeral he meets the lovely widow (Bellucci in a far too short but hot appearance). She tells him of a meeting her husband's organization is about to have to select a successor. Bond attends the meeting where he finds out who the head of this organization is and he also runs into its main henchman (Bautista) with whom he engages the lamest car chase ever filmed.Next he visits Mr. White (a recurring bad guy I understand) who tells Bond he may get some info from his daughter--a psychologist at some fancy alternative health/kale institute. Soon enough Bautista is back to grab the girl (Seydoux--if they had to pick a girl from Blue is the Warmest Color, they should have gone with Exarchopoulos) but Bond manages to rescue her. She takes him to Morocco where they find the next clue in unmasking this scary Spectre organization and its softspoken leader. There they discover yet another clue and they are off to the desert where Oberhauser awaits them and unfolds his plan. He tortures Bond a bit but but he and the girl manage to escape after blowing the place up. But so does Oberhauser.Meanwhile M is battling the head of the new security organization that is going online and global any minute as The Nine Eyes, an expanded and nastier version of the current Five Eyes. In the end everyone converges on the same location for the resolution which isn't much of a resolution at all.Spectre follows somewhat the tone of Skyfall. There's much talk about Bond's past, his suffering, Vesper (why are they still going on about her?), etc. At least Oberhauser's background is far more interesting. Action isn't the highlight of this movie, it goes for a very long time without any. But then Bautista shows up again for a great fight scene with Bond. The excellent intro scene makes you think this is a return to form for Bond movies, but unfortunately, that's not the case. And it won't be if they keep hiring this Mendes person to direct--as if Skyfall wasn't bad enough. But these days they'll hire anyone to direct, the more incompetent the better apparently. Waltz's performance/character is too understated and underwhelming. While the movie takes itself too seriously, Waltz seems to be playing it for laughs at times, very strange.What I did like is that Spectre is finally a lot more political. There are some criticism of the global security police state, of antidemocratic ideals. It's seems that at last, filmmakers are coming out of their self-induced stupor of playing cheerleaders for the establishment. I'm not sure where Bond movies are headed from now on. It's seems they have painted themselves into a corner. With Oberhauser they have the villain of villains, with Spectre an omnipresent omnimalevolent organization. Then what? Hopefully they'll get the Nolans to write and direct. They may be able to rescue Bond films.",6,4,11,12 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Cool but so empty.
","In some post-apocalyptic desert a guy is captured by a bunch of guys. He's kept as a source of blood for ill citizens of the citadel. In charge of it all is some old guy who's wasting away. He's controls the water in the area and keeps the population below the rock in misery and thirst. Occasionally he opens the floodgates and lets water run down to the masses who adore him, at least that day. One day he sends some select few to gather weapons in exchange for water.But on the way to this exchange the girl driving the truck (a Charlize Theron ruined by a super short haircut) changes routes and goes rogue. The rest of the entourage is confused until they realize what she's doing and go after her. Among those driving after her is a sick guy who has the guy from the intro chained the the front of the car. Eventually the guy has his chance and frees himself. This is at a point when he and the other rogue truck are by themselves. Turns out the girl is transporting a bunch of nymphs to safety. The ruler enraged, goes after them himself with a convoy of crazies.The girl aims to reach 'the green place' and our hero joins forces with her of sorts after they realize that they are no threat to each other. First they have to escape the the other gang with whom the deal was going to take place. More violence ensues. The girl meets a couple of girls to whom she's related. And they decide that the best course of action is to drive back and take over the citadel and eliminate the ruler.The first 45 minutes or so of Mad Max are quite exhilarating. It could have been even better if our lead character weren't bound and wearing a mask that won't allow him to speak but only grunt. But dialogue is definitely not a strength of this movie. There is very little of it, and what there is, is rather adolescent. Story-wise it's absolutely mind-boggling how 2/3 of the way into the story they decided to turn things around and basically repeat the first 1/3 making a good chunk pointless. For a moment things do pick up as for a while the movie had lost plenty of steam. So we have a movie that's 30 minutes too long and completely wastes a character that should have been a lead. What you're left with is wondering at the visuals and this neat world they created. For an R-rated action movie this one is rather mild and could have benefited from gorier sequences and some nudity.",7,1,2,1 October 2015
The Martian," Alright, but too long
","Some young goofs are up on Mars. They are warned that a storm is coming. The resident botanist suggest the wait it out. The commander decides they will escape. So in the middle of the storm they walk to their rocket when one of the guys is it by an antenna and left for dead while the rest fly off to their space station.Next day the guy, Mark the botanist, wakes up, injured but alright. He checks supplies, knows that the next mission to Mars will be in 4 years, so he starts growing potatoes inside the base using Mars soil and astronaut waste. He has no way to communicate with anyone. So he digs up the Rover from the 90s. Eventually someone at NASA notices that stuff is moving around on Mars and they figure he's alive, but they don't share it with the rest of the crew on the space station. Through the rover he communicates with JPL, which is actually staffed by people who look like they could be scientists and not by a bunch of teens. Meanwhile NASA politicians and scientists think about what to do.Their plan to send Mark supplies fails. So do some other ideas. Until some other young guy figures out that the space station can meet up with Mark if it changes its path and if he manages to make it to another rocket on Mars and use it fly near the station's orbit. But of course there are many complications along the way. But the space station crew does decide they will go and get him.I haven't read the book and I'm not concerned whether this movie's science is realistic or not. The movie works for a while, then it stopped working for me. I did appreciate the science but then they ruined it when some astronaut no less tells another to speak in English. Is there some law that mandates writers include that stupid line whenever a character explains something complex? I also enjoyed the politics. The NASA boss and his sidekick are more concerned with appearances and PR than with solving the problem at hand. Casting is a joke. There are perhaps two main actors who looks like they belong at NASA/JPL but several background actors do. For a space movie this one offers few cool space sights, all there is is reddish sand. The resolution reminded me a bit too much of the worst space movie of them all, Gravity.That said, this movie is probably an excellent family movie, and it is a remarkably healthy movie for Hollywood standards. But even then I can't imagine the kids or anyone else not getting bored at some point. The Martian is about 45 minutes too long, it just doesn't come to an end. It has epic ambitions but the story isn't nearly as spectacular as the filmmakers think it is. I was hoping for some twist, for aliens to appear, something that would propel this movie to excellence. But it never happened.",6,0,1,19 March 2016
Furious 7," Wild and impressive
","This time around, the villain from the previous movie, Owen Shaw, is in a coma and his brother, Deckard (Statham) swears he will avenge him. So he breaks into Hobbs office to download info on Dom's team. A fantastic fight between Shaw and Hobbs ensues.Meanwhile Dom and co. are living the quiet peaceful life until Shaw blows up Dom's house and kills Han. During the funeral Dom spots a dark car and chases it. It's Shaw. As they are about to confront each other some special forces team shows up and Shaw escapes.Turns out the guy in charge (Russell) wants to make a deal with Dom. Some terrorist has grabbed an unknown hacker who has created Persons of Interest's The Machine that spies on everyone at all times. He wants Dom to retrieve the hacker and The Machine, here called God's Eye. In return Dom gets to use it to track down Shaw.The hacker is being transported in some convoy in the Caucasus. That leads our team to parachute in cars no less, and go after the convoy. They find the hacker who turns out to be some girl. In the process they have to fight the terrorist's men and even Shaw appears for no good reason. Some cool fights with Tony Jaa ensue as well as some wild gravity-defying stunts.So know they have The Machine right? Wrong. The hacker girl has stored it in a drive and given it to some guy in Abu Dhabi. Off they go then. But the guy doesn't have the drive anymore but sold it (?) to some super rich guy who has installed the drive in his super car (???). So now the crew crashes a fancy party in a high rise penthouse where the car is kept (?). They are caught and skinny Rodriguez has to take a beating from Rousey. Meanwhile Dom and Brian have no other choice than to take the car and escape, flying from one building to another and another.OK, now they have The Machine, or is it Samaritan, and they track down Shaw. Shouldn't be too hard to grab him. But he's super special forces, and ambushes Dom's crew and the special ops guys and grabs God's Eye in the process.Now our guys will try to set a trap for him in a LA. He does go for it and so does the terrorist who goes after them with a military chopper and a drone, while Brian has to face Jaa and Dom and Statham finally get to beat each other up. Hobbs, who been in the hospital all this time makes also appearance in Rambo fashion in the end.Yes, there's a lot of story in the long Furious 7. So much that it could easily have been turned into 2 movies. Or they could have ended it after the Caucasus adventure.This installment benefits greatly from director James Wan, someone who actually knows how to direct a movie. Some of the shots during the fights are amazing. All of the fighting scenes have some memorable moment and overall are really well done. It's not easy to impress with fight scenes these days, but Furious 7 does it. But it's not just the fight scenes. Granted that driving isn't much at the center of these movies anymore, what driving there is, is pretty good. And so are other stunts. The scene of Walker escaping from a bus hanging over a cliff is spectacular. So is the attention to detail as when a bad guy falls from his seat and nearly takes out Walker as he hangs from the bus's door. Or when Jaa and Walker race down stairs on a door.Finally some of the cast has been trimmed, no Han, no Giselle, fewer other goofs, very little Elena. Instead they added a bunch of great villains--Statham who fortunately doesn't say a whole lot but looks menacing instead; they finally hired someone who can fight--Tony Jaa. And they hired someone who can act--Kurt Russell. There's Hounsou as well. It wouldn't have hurt to hire a second writer to add some dialogue. At least this time around, the dialogue isn't entirely embarrassing. There's still some silliness but less. Some of the humor does work though. No doubt there's plenty of room for more cuts in the cast--we could do without Brewster, Rodriguez, Bridges.The unfortunate death of Walker would be a great opportunity to put an end to this series, while they're on top. Instead 'Diesel' already warned us there are 3 more movies coming. Why? With Furious 7, the franchise grew up into a legitimate full-blown mega summer blockbuster. With that however, the prospect of where this series will go from here are dim. More and crazier stunts will drive it into lousy Michael Bay CGI territory. If they end up hiring more and bigger familiar faces, it'll end up being The Expendables On Wheels. I just hope they find the strength to not hire Bruce Willis. If they keep traveling around the world for missions it'll look like and urban team version of James Bond. The next movie would be the right time to return to the roots and go for something smaller and tighter. If they keep Wan on board they may have a chance.",8,1,4,24 May 2015
