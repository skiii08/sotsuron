Ford v Ferrari," Ford v. Ferrari great period piece
","Ford v Ferrari celebrates friendship, and the good, old fashioned underdog spirit, going up against the odds to achieve the impossible.Bale and Damon make a formidable pair, jiving between friendship, respect, banter and an obscene amount of technical knowledge. Through their performances, they make the friendship and engineering relationship between 'man and machine' personal. And as the film finally waves that checkered flag, Mangold creates pure racing at its finest.Director: James Mangold Cast: Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, Caitriona Balfe, JJ Field, Noah Jupe, Ray McKinnon, Tracy Letts, Remo Girone Screenplay: Jez Butterworth & John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller Cinematography: Phedon Papamichael Music: Marco Beltrami, Buck Sanders U.S. Distributor: 20th Century Fox 8/10",8,1,2,20 January 2020
Insidious: Chapter 2," INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 (2013) 10 / 10 Totally Excellent!!!
","The haunted Lambert family seeks to uncover the mysterious childhood secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world.The second just has it (all) from Directer James Wan & writer Leigh Whannell . The original cast of Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye and Ty Simpkins in INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 knock this supernatural, Ghost possession out of the 'surreal' Freak me the F-out ball park. The weirdness with scores of jump scares and even an odd Back To The Future 2-style subplot that's undeveloped yet still adds to the overall sense of crazy. It's the screenplay's salient collision of past and present that sets the film apart from most horror sequels. Horror maestro du jour James Wan (Saw, Dead Silence, The Conjuring) serves up a juicy, fright-filled spookfest with this follow-up to the 2011 hit. Magnificent .",10,0,0,27 November 2018
Spartacus," Kirk Douglas is terrific as the iron-jawed slave fueled by righteous fury.
","Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, John Gavin, Nina Foch, Herbert Lom, John Ireland, Charles McGraw, Woody Strode, Joanna Barnes.
Epic-scale saga with Douglas as a rebellious slave who leads a crusade for freedom against the forces of the Roman Empire. Rousing battle scenes, great costumes and art direction, never been better cinematography and screenplay by Trumbo. WWII Navy vet Kirk Douglas gave Trumbo the screenplay credit.
Most of the film is historically accurate. It made Kubrick's reputation, freeing him to become one of the most influential directors of the last half of the 20th century. It's the only film the British masters Olivier and Laughton ever acted in together. The only Kubrick film yielding an actor's Oscar, for Peter Ustinov. When combat veteran President-elect Kennedy crossed Legion picket lines to see it, the film broke the Hollywood blacklist. Multi layered film and absolutely a must see masterpiece.",10,1,2,31 August 2019
It," IT is something unique and special and in this adaption they nailed it.
","In the summer of 1989, a group of bullied kids band together to destroy a shape-shifting monster, which disguises itself as a clown and preys on the children of Derry, their small Maine town.
Great performance by Bill Skarsgard. He nailed Pennywise .I couldn't picture anyone else bringing the character of 'IT' to life as well as he did. It was an awesome thriller that keeps you on your toes. Can't wait for 'It Chapter Two'!",9,0,1,4 September 2019
Hereditary," Ari Aster writing and directing is 'the genuine article' .
","Summary: When Ellen, the matriarch of the Graham family, passes away, her daughter's family begins to unravel cryptic and increasingly terrifying secrets about their ancestry. The more they discover, the more they find themselves trying to outrun the sinister fate they seem to have inherited.
A harrowing story of unthinkable family tragedy that veers into the realm of the supernatural. There are nods to great horror film such as (The Omen) and (Rosemary's Baby). Make no mistake though Ari Aster writing and directing is 'the genuine article' .
Hereditary is one of the scariest movies around, and a spectacular showcase for actors Toni Collette and Alex Wolff. Hypnotic and intense throughout, the brilliantly executed Hereditary taps into the ghosts within all of us .The insidious roots of family dysfunction ; and turn them upside down and all around. It's an audacious supernatural thriller where the psychological fallout is just as disturbing as the apparitions that come chillingly to life. 9/10",9,1,4,13 July 2019
Lifeboat," A true Alfred Hitchcock underrated classic .Basically a must watch film.
","Seeking a creative challenge after several years' worth of fairly elaborate melodramas, director Alfred Hitchcock stages all of the action in Lifeboat in one tiny boat, adrift in the North Atlantic. Director: Alfred Hitchcock use this single cinematic tech in Lifeboat first . Then he expands of this brilliant technique and pushes it further in 'Rear Window' & Dial 'M' for Murder . Lifeboat earned Hitchcock his second Oscar nomination for best director .
Only Hitchcock could pull off this compelling drama in such tight quarters!Several survivors of a torpedoed merchant ship in World War II find themselves in the same lifeboat with one of the U-boat men who sunk it. Stars: Tallulah Bankhead, John Hodiak, Walter Slezak.
Hitchcock's shifting sympathies guarantee our guilty involvement with the characters until he builds to a climax of intellectual and spiritual excitement. The film with its different character studies is a true Alfred Hitchcock underrated classic .Basically a must watch film.",9,1,1,16 February 2019
A Star Is Born," A Star is Born will tug at the heartstrings
","A musician helps a young singer find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral. In 'A Star Is Born,' Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga fuse their considerable talents to depict the raw and passionate tale of Jack and Ally, two artistic souls coming together, on stage and in life. Theirs is a complex journey through the beauty and the heartbreak of a relationship struggling to survive. In this new take on the iconic love story .Apparently you can make the same movie four times and still make it work, as this 2018 remake of the 1976 remake of the 1954 remake of the 1937 original certainly proves. Who knew Lady Gaga was this good an actor or, for that matter, that Bradley Cooper was this good a singer and director? Wonderfully updating the timeless story of rising fame and fallen stardom to our modern perception of celebrity, A Star is Born will tug at the heartstrings of even those who have seen this story play out time and time again. Absolutely deserves to be put up as one of the year's best films of 2018.",10,1,4,24 February 2019
Citizen Kane," Orson Welles's epic tale of a publishing tycoon's rise and fall
","The Orson Welles film is generally considered the greatest American film of the sound period, and it may be more fun than any other great movie.
Citizen Kane...has the best of everything: a great director and star, innovative cinematography, dreamlike - even nightmarish - art direction, a sonorous musical score, a skillful screenplay in which comic passages intensify the movie's tragic qualities by means of their grotesque juxtaposition (how lifelike!), a psychological / narrative form that predates our contemporary 'psycho-histories' by at least 40 years, and best of all, a memorial word that, when spoken, recalls the film out of thin air.",10,0,0,26 February 2019
Inglourious Basterds," The actors are top notch and the carnage is just right.
","In Nazi-occupied France during World War II, a plan to assassinate Nazi leaders by a group of Jewish U.S. soldiers coincides with a theatre owner's vengeful plans for the same.
Directors: Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth (uncredited). What a great flick.Quentin Tarantino returns with the story of the Basterds, a group of Jewish soldiers performing guerilla warfare and terror tactics behind enemy lines to strike fear into the hearts of German soldiers during World War II. Inglourious Basterds is a very difficult film to pigeonhole. It's part Jewish revenge fantasy, part gung ho war film, part knowing parody of patriotic flag wavers and 100% Tarantino. Tarantino has found his new muse in Melanie Laurent. She was fabulous . The performance of Christoph Waltz, playing the Nazi Gestapo figure Col. Hans Landa, is the highlight of the film. His ability to convey courtliness and sympathy and then go to commit the cruelest of horrors is simply superb.
Inglourious Basterds is naughty, apocalyptic fun -- Tarantino's version of a war movie, with history rewritten to avenge the guilty in ways that satisfy his pop-art cinema. Like a bat to the head, it's not too subtle, but you can't help but watch.",10,3,5,9 March 2019

","Packed with action, humor, and visual thrills, Captain Marvel introduces the MCU's latest hero with an origin story that makes effective use of the franchise's signature formula. It rises to the occasion with strong performances and with its directors' willingness to slow down and take their story seriously, balancing humor, action, and exposition in a carefully calibrated package. Watching Danvers' story play out, complete with boggling plot twists and a scene-stealing friendly feline, is hugely entertaining.
Captain Marvel, the first Marvel adaptation both to star a woman and to be co-directed by a woman. What a great choice this turned out to be . A satisfying standalone launch for Marvel's latest superhero combines sci-fi action with '90s nostalgia. Overcoming minor stumbles, it ultimately soars.",8,3,10,4 April 2019

","A nurse, a policeman, a young married couple, a salesman and other survivors of a worldwide plague that is producing aggressive, flesh-eating zombies, take refuge in a mega Midwestern shopping mall.Director: Zack Snyder
Writers: George A. Romero, James Gunn (screenplay)
Stars: Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Mekhi PhiferDawn of the Dead is not just a good remake ..it is a good zombie film in general. 28 Days Later basically kicked started the zombie genre again in 2003 and in a sense helped this movie get green lighted. It shows that the zombie genre is in full force because Dawn of the Dead 2004 does not disappoint. The director Zack Snyder really knew what we wanted. He did not just do a remake and carbon copied the original. He made the film stand out on its own and one of the thing he added was fast moving zombies. In my opinion it worked and made the film intense.The movie waste no time getting to the blood and gore. Within the first 10 minutes we are treated to an intense zombie opening . Not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked; followed by one of the best opening credits ever. What better way to start off this bloody film than with Johnny Cash?This is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. Spoiler :a zombie baby. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. This is one hell of a horror movie.",9,0,0,5 June 2020

The Irishman," Yet another epic film by Scorsese with a cast that is second to none.
","Storyline - In the 1950s, truck driver Frank Sheeran gets involved with Russell Bufalino and his Pennsylvania crime family. As Sheeran climbs the ranks to become a top hit man, he also goes to work for Jimmy Hoffa -- a powerful Teamster tied to organized crime.This proves that Scorsese has the skill and longevity to be considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The Irishman is one of Martin Scorsese's best films, that is all that can really be said. He is able to return to the gangster genre with a brand new outlook that makes this film wholly original. The Irishman examines the ideas of death and time through retrospect ; Pesci, DeNiro, Pacino are at the top of their game. The use of Groundbreaking VFX took Anti-Aging to the next level, whether it be from CG or makeup, is overall incredible. The editing is as phenomenal. While featuring three terrific lead performances the film also features many wonderful supporting ones as well. Ray Romano, Stephen Graham, Harvey Keitel, Bobby Cannavale, etc etc!A fine curated piece of art, that's what Scorsese put before our eyes, he brought out everything in his arsenal of skills, every move is calculated to the teeth, every work is accounted for, it never skips a beat, it comes packaged in a smart setup which is not surprising with a director like Scorsese, in its over three hour runtime, not a single second is wasted, every little thing meant something, every frame worked towards the story, whether it's a one-second still or a ten minutes sequence, everything clicks here.A blend of historical gangster storytelling with the main character weaving throughout it unobtrusively. Excellent cinematography with authentic backdrops, music, references. Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano demonstrate why they are such revered actors. A brilliant film that is a must see, destined to become yet another Scorsese classic.

Aquaman," good old-fashioned fun.
","From Warner Bros. Pictures and director James Wan comes an action-packed adventure that spans the vast, visually breathtaking underwater world of the seven seas, 'Aquaman,' starring Jason Momoa in the title role. The film reveals the origin story of half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime--one that will not only force him to face who he really is, but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be... a king. Aquaman swims with its entertainingly ludicrous tide, offering up CGI superhero spectacle that delivers energetic action with an emphasis on good old-fashioned fun.",8,0,1,17 January 2019
The Terminator," The thing that won't die, and the nightmare that won't end.
","T1 is really a pretty smart movie. It's Man vs. Machine in a really fake, low budget future. For the Machines to win, they send back a killer robot to kill Sarah Connor, who will mother a child named John, who in turn will grow up and one day lead The Resistance against the Machines. With her dead, no John, and the Machines win. So Man sends a man back in time (apparently, 10 years from now, in 2029, we'll be able to time travel) to stop The Terminator so John can be born. The story holds up nicely, but the action sequences have been done to death so many times since, they don't fare as well. Yet the movie manages to give you the feeling that the studio had no part in the creative process, and let them just make their little movie. Here's $6 mil, Jimmy, go out and play. I just read that James Cameron had the image of the metallic skeleton killer robot first, and worked backwards from there. And because of budget constrictions (he couldn't have a future that looked all that good, in the movie, not in real life), so he made it a time travel story so he can shoot in present day. Pretty cool, if it's true. I wonder if that happened to him with TITANIC?So like I said, some of the movie doesn't kick the way it did in 1984. For that matter, what does? David Lee Roth? Anyway, the good far outweighs the bad, and if you haven't seen it in decades, you should watch it again.",10,0,2,2 November 2019

Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Man: Homecoming
","This Spider-Man movie is the first Spider-Man movie in the Marvel canon. The prior two Spider-Man franchises are irrelevant to this series. Spider-Man, introduced in Captain America: Civil War, is part of the final phase of the Marvel Universe leading up to Avengers: The Infinity War/End Game. Marvel opted to skip the origin story of Spider-Man and instead, framed this film to be more of a coming of age tale for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and his quest to become part of the Avengers.Technically the film is very impressive from start to finish and there are some truly great scenes scattered throughout the picture. The action scenes are all highly exciting and it's the perfect use of CGI.The performance by Holland was excellent and I thought he was perfect during the scenes where the character is actually being a nerd and conflicted with various emotions. Keaton was also great in his role as he perfectly played the villain. Robert Downey, Jr. could sleepwalk in his role as Tony Stark and was fun as usual.It's nice light comic book fare. Others in the cast involve: Marisa Tomei as Peter Parker's Aunt May; Gwyneth Paltrow appears as Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's assistant/girlfriend; Chris Evans reprises his role as Captain America appearing in educational PSA videos that Peter ends up watching during school; John Favreau reprises his role as Happy Hogan, head of security for the Avengers; and Disney star Zendaya plays one of Peter's classmates. 8/10",8,0,0,7 June 2020

The movie exposes the reality of altered lives and the inability to communicate the experience of war on the front lines or the home front.The Best Years of Our Lives is one of the most timely and immediate Best Picture winners in Academy history.
Profoundly and sensitively balances the private demons of scarred veterans and the press of public policies that leave their mark on daily life.This movie is a masterpiece. The writing, the acting, the blending of several stories without being even the least bit choppy, everything about this movie is exceptional. Seven Academy Awards.

Glory," Perhaps the greatest film ever made about the American Civil War.
","Shaw was an officer in the Federal Army during the American Civil War who volunteered to lead the first company of black soldiers. Shaw was forced to deal with the prejudices of both the enemy (who had orders to kill commanding officers of blacks), and of his own fellow officers.We see the formation of the regiment, its first volunteers, their training, disputes with administrators, their first operations in South Carolina and, finally, their moment of glory - the attack on Fort Wagner.The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit themselves valiantly at Fort Wagner, SC, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates.

He is soon swept up in a an amusing and suspenseful twist of plot complications involving spies and counterspies with an unpredictable series of nail-biting scenes that never let up until the smashing climax at Mount Rushmore. The dust-cropping scene is a highlight, skillfully edited and photographed for maximum effect.As usual, the suspense begins with the opening credits as Bernard Herrmann's staccato notes of music prepare us for what follows.

","'The Exorcist' is one the most disturbing and terrifying films ever made; moviegoers were passing out and bolting from their seats and running from the theater because of the film's intensity when it was first released. I remember my mother would go to the neighbors for 'bridge card' night once a week . I was about 13 and did not need a sitter. I was off my lease and would watch TV unsupervised. I will never forget watching 'The Exorcist' on TV censored . But that did not matter it scared the hell out of me. I still remember to this day the censored line ' Your Mother sews Socks that Smell '. 'The Exorcist' was first released, the concept of demonic possession was something new for audiences to digest. The film pushed the limits of what was acceptable to be shown to audiences.The visceral language the imagery included a desecrated statue of the Virgin Mary, a young girl urinating on a carpet in front of dinner guests and that is the mild stuff . Director William Friedkin was bold enough to take the film where few filmmakers would have the courage to go, thus making the film unforgettable. Special Effects . The makeup of the possessed child is something you can't unsee; it's so unsettling in how it personifies the face of evil. Such realistic effects for the movie that it would be hard to see how computer generated effects of today could even compete. 'The Exorcist' feels less like a movie and more like a true-life event being captured on film.Mercedes McCambridge . The voice from hell. She provided the demonic voice of the possessed child, and her performance is one of the key factors that makes the movie so terrifying. I will never forget her voice acting as I watched as a youth it is still as frightening 40 years later.

This 'dirty dozen' includes a sex pervert (Telly Savalas), a psycho (John Cassavetes), a killer (Donald Sutherland), and the equally malevolent Charles Bronson, Trini Lopez, Jim Brown, and Clint Walker. On the dim promise of receiving pardons if they survive, the criminals undergo a brutal training program, then are marched behind enemy lines dressed as Nazi soldiers, the better to overtake the chateau and kill everyone in it--including the innocent wives and mistresses of the German officers.The cast here is brilliant and each brings something to the screen that makes this such a great film. As an action film, The Dirty Dozen ranks as a classic of the genre.",9,3,4,26 February 2019
Gone with the Wind," Gone With The Wind: My First Time View
","Producer: David O. Selznick
Director: Victor Fleming
Writer: Sidney Howard
Stars: Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, Thomas Mitchell, Hattie McDaniel
3h 58min Drama, History, Romance melodrama.Gone With the Wind. My new number 1 Greatest American Movie (followed by The Godfather, Ben-Hur , Casablanca, Taxi Driver, Star Wars , Citizen Kane , Rebecca).'Gone With the Wind' presents a sentimental view of the Civil War, in which the 'Old South' takes the place of Camelot and the war was fought not so much to defeat the Confederacy; as to give Miss Scarlett O'Hara her comeuppance. The tainted nostalgia comes with the territory. Yet as 'GWTW' approaches its 81th anniversary, it is still a towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well.Vivien Leigh stars as Scarlett O'Hara. In Gone with the Wind, She is always after something. She is fiery, stubborn, beautiful, and selfish, and won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal. When Scarlett O'Hara raises her fist to the sky and vows never to be hungry again, not only do we believe her, we understand her. Vivien Leigh's Scarlett , is one of greatest , most moving and varied , performance I've ever seen on the screen. A touchstone of great melodramatic acting. Rhett Butler is played by Clark Gable, a mustached, cocky, manly actor. Although Scarlett is the center of the film, Gable's intensity matches Leigh's. His ego seems to be competing with hers, physically wrestling hers on the screen. Their energy and passion rise up to meet the gigantic film. The supporting characters are lovely, too, especially Oscar winner Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett's Mammy. She steals every scene she's in with her explosive line readings, and her compassion.
five-time Oscar nominee Olivia de Havilland's performance as the moral fiber of society, was absolutely compelling and as beautiful as see is.Tremendously impressive cinematic experience. From the amazing performances to Fleming's incredible direction and awe-inspiring images and music. This is a film that deserves to be experienced. A time-tested favorite,'Gone With the Wind' 10/10Trivia about Gone With the Wind:The four principal stars were billed in this order: Clark Gable, followed by Leslie Howard (as Scarlett's obsessive love, the glum Ashley Wilkes) and Olivia de Havilland (as sweet Melanie Wilkes, Ashley's cousin), and then Vivien Leigh last with '...and presenting' -- that is, until she won the Oscar and it was changed to 'starring.'The film (originally rough-cut at 6 hours in length) was challenging in its making, due to its controversial subject matter (including rape, drunkenness, moral dissipation and adultery) and its epic qualities, with more than 50 speaking roles and 2,400 extras.Adjusted for inflation, no movie can match the $3.7 billion haul that Gone with the Wind's $390 million box-office receipts since its 1939 release would be worth in today's dollars. The film currently remains the box-office (Champ). Yes More Than #2. 1. Avengers: Endgame (2019). Box office: $2.796 billion.A nationwide casting search for an actress to play the Southern belle Scarlett resulted in the hiring of young British actress Vivien Leigh, although over 30 other well-known actresses had been tested or considered including: Katharine Hepburn, Miriam Hopkins, Susan Hayward, Loretta Young, Carole Lombard, Paulette Goddard, Margaret Sullavan, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Lana Turner, Joan Bennett, Mae West, Tallulah Bankhead, Jean Arthur, and Lucille Ball. In all, 1,400 actresses were interviewed for the part of Scarlett O'Hara, and 400 performed audition-readings. Although MGM star Clark Gable was expected to play the role of the dashing Charlestonian war profiteer Rhett Butler, Errol Flynn, Ronald Colman, and Gary Cooper were also considered for the part.The landmark film received tremendous accolades, more than any previous films to date: thirteen nominations and eight (competitive) Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Victor Fleming - the only credited director), Best Actress (Vivien Leigh), a posthumous Best Screenplay (Sidney Howard, along with collaborative assistance from Edwin Justin Mayer, John Van Druten, Ben Hecht, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Jo Swerling) - the first post-humous winner of its kind, Best Color Cinematography, Best Interior Decoration, Best Film Editing, and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel - the first time an African-American had been nominated and honored) and two honorary plaques, one for production designer William Cameron Menzies for the 'use of color for the enhancement of dramatic mood,' and the other a technical production award for Don Musgrave for 'pioneering in the use of coordinated equipment.'Many of the five nominations that lost were unexpected: Best Actor (Clark Gable who lost to Robert Donat for Goodbye, Mr. Chips), Best Supporting Actress (Olivia de Havilland who was competing against co-star Hattie McDaniel), Best Sound Recording, Best Original Score (Max Steiner), and Best Special Effects. Its record of a total of ten Academy Awards wins held firm until 1959, when Ben-Hur (1959) won eleven Oscars. It was phenomenal that Gone With the Wind did so well, given that 1939 boasted some of the greatest American films ever made, including Ninotchka, The Wizard of Oz, Wuthering Heights, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and Stagecoach.",10,3,4,25 February 2020

","You relish something. You don't relish in something. Abigail didn't kill the rabbit. Abigail didn't appear to be bad at first. She appeared to be a victim. Her badness and manipulative nature was revealed gradually. The way I saw the end was that Rachel's character, Sarah, had used Queen Anne for her own political purposes but she still had feelings for Anne, maybe even love. Abigail had no real feelings for Anne, or political agenda but just wanted to elevate her position through being Anne's favourite. So at the end, after Abigail has won out over Sarah, we see Anne and Abigail stuck in the rather bleak relationship. Anne as a lonely Queen using Abigail for sexual gratification without real feelings for her, and Abigail discontented but stuck in that role with no real feelings for Anne.",10,2,4,15 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon A Time in Hollywood film review
","Director: Quentin Tarantino
Writer: Quentin Tarantino
Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Timothy Olyphant, Al Pacino
Narrator: Kurt Russell
A bold preamble flashes up on screen announcing Quentin Tarantino's ninth film. It's a stark reminder that Tarantino is competing with his own legacy. Can anything truly match the sheer brilliance of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction?
First cuts are often the deepest, but Once Upon a Time in Hollywood comfortably reaches the bar set so unreasonably high.His customary attention to detail is forensic as 35mm, 16mm, 8mm, film is used to frame a story set in 1969. Fictional characters are cleverly set against true events as they mingle with real people in a concurrent storyline.Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a jobbing TV actor who fears the big movie roles have passed him by. He is consoled by Bounty Law; a long running Western where he plays the grizzled bad guy. Faithful wingman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is Rick's stunt double, best friend and confidante. Back in Beverley Hills Rick has new neighbors. Impossibly beautiful actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) has moved in with husband Roman Polanski. Rick is excited by the prospect and could be one pool party away from starring in a Polanski movie. If only he could actually meet them. Meanwhile, producer Harvey Schwarz (Al Pacino) is convinced he can reignite Rick's career with a spaghetti western. Interestingly, the Manson clan is hardly shown in the movie. I actually like this choice, because it left a lingering thought that perhaps Manson was a danger at all times, and didn't play to the audience the way I thought it would. It wasn't a story about the Manson murders. Manson just happened to be going on at the time Dalton and Booth were having their struggles, and it intersected.There are many pleasures to be found in 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,' but Tarantino's interest in replicating Los Angeles in 1969 is worth the price of admission alone. It's enough to find period cars and costumes, but Tarantino goes above and beyond, filling backgrounds with detailed signage and theater marquees, redressed buildings, and packing the radio with advertisements and glorious rock hits to set the mood. Tech credits are downright miraculous, securing the time machine nature of the feature, with Tarantino as much in love with his layered frames as he is with the characters, working diligently to take away the modern world. There's enough going on around the action in 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' to warrant multiple viewings, just to see the hospital corners Tarantino achieves when resurrecting the end of an era. Very impressive .DiCaprio proves to be such a perfect choice for Dalton that one can't really imagine anyone else in the part. It's one of his best performances, although he's arguably topped by a fantastic Pitt, that reminds viewers how wonderful he can be in the right material.It's a glorious fusion of genres; part western, buddy movie and homage to popular culture in the 1960s. Stylish and visually stunning, it bears the classic hallmarks of a Tarantino film. Maddening tangents, delightful cameos and set pieces all provide a compulsive mixture. The cinematography, the writing, the casting, the soundtrack, all flawless. This is a superior film and sits comfortably in my top three Tarantino films. 10/10",10,12,17,5 February 2020

Bolt," Bolt 2008
","Director: Byron Howard and Chris WilliamsStarring: John Travolta, Miley Cyrus, Susie EssmanBolt was the first 3D animated Disney movie to be released after buying Pixar and it shows. The 3D effects are quite noticeable and true to the high bar Pixar has always set for itself they are natural in presentation.It is a story of a super dog Bolt ( voice by John Travolta) who battles against the bad green eyed villain Dr. Calisco (voice by Malcolm McDowell) with his human girl Penny (voice by Miley Cyrus) in TV. Bolt does not know he is just an actor and that his super powers are not real.As a dog loving person I knew that I would like this at least in some level, but was pleasantly surprised with the quality of both the story and the technology. The animation just looks plain awesome in 3D all those animals hairs look so real and the 3D really works beautifully by making the movie an enjoyment to watch.The animal characters are incredibly cute, but they still have their own personalities and some edge. The dialogue is witty and charming. Bolt is a fun adventure with likeable characters and some good gags. There are also some very good choreographed action sequences.Good Disney movie for all ages. Well CGI animated film and a nice likable cast of characters. 8/10",8,0,1,27 March 2020
Dog Day Afternoon," Fueled by a gripping performance from Al Pacino
","A man robs a bank to pay for his lover's operation; it turns into a hostage situation and a media circus.Framed by great work from director Sidney Lumet and fueled by a gripping performance from Al Pacino, Dog Day Afternoon offers a finely detailed snapshot of people in crisis with tension-soaked drama shaded in black humor. As much as it is about a deeply troubled individual, 'Dog Day Afternoon' is about a shift toward exploitation in the American media via live television.

","The Fantastic Four learn that they aren't the only super-powered beings in the universe when they square off against the powerful Silver Surfer and the planet-eating Galactus.While an improvement on its predecessor, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is nevertheless a juvenile, simplistic picture that has little benefit beyond its special effects.",7,1,3,5 March 2019
1917," Marching Through a Labyrinth of Death
","Two young British soldiers during the First World War are given an impossible mission: deliver a message deep in enemy territory that will stop 1,600 men, and one of the soldiers' brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap.There is a lot of beauty in 1917. The war is catastrophic and the casualties are sickening, but it's all presented in this gorgeous light through the intricate eyes of Roger Deakins (cinematography).Bravo Roger Deakins! Thomas Newman's score is gorgeously depressing with this layer of victory sprinkled in for good measure. This is quite possibly the most technically sound film of 2019.1917 is a visual spectacle that is sure to be brought up again and again in the years to come. 9/10",9,0,2,10 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Heroes inspire others to be greater. I think that is what 'The Last Jedi' does best.
","Rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker, who is unsettled by the strength of her powers. Meanwhile, the Resistance prepares for battle with the First Order.I will admit I am wired with a with the sense of melancholy sensibilities. I lost track of how many times i wiped a tear while watching Rian Johnson's film. But I'm sure I also laughed hard just as many times, if not more. It is in general mind-blowing, it is emotional and it is filled with surprises. The Last Jedi really manages to keep the Star Wars spirit while being innovative on many fronts. Nothing can prepare you for the emotional ride it takes you on. It's a truly epic journey.Star Wars: Episode VIII had some amazing set pieces. Wonderful cinematography and special effects. the 3D presentation added to the film. The fabulous film score from the greatest film composers of all time, John Williams as splendid.The acting from Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are sublime. Tapping into my sense of nostalgia for Star Wars Saga. Daisy Ridley as Rey tremendous. Johnson eloquently deepens his characters in the story long, long ago in the galaxy far, far away. Adam Driver is welcome strength returning as the Dark Side Force's Kylo Ren. The other narrative threads are often perfunctory in the subplot with Resistance fighters Finn, played by solid John Boyega, Poe Dameron, played by intrepid Oscar Isaac, and Rose, played by stellar newcomer Kelly Marie Tran. And how does't like Benicio Del Toro ? Fantastic !The Last Jedi is clever, well-tailored and genuine. Heroes and villains, and those who are somewhere in between. Rian Johnson created a beautiful tale a filmed it with stylistic brilliance and terrific pacing. From the excellent cinematography, snappy dialogues and first rate music, The Last Jedi makes you feel overwhelmed and fills you with odd admiration for the story that is being conveyed. 9/10Director: Rian Johnson

Allen and Keaton had a winning formula for the 1970s Jewish neurotic plus WASP neurotic, equals successful comedy.

Pride & Prejudice," Zombie action, comedy and horror with some classical literature mixed in.
","The story revolves around the young ladies of the Bennet family, Elizabeth (Lily James), Jane (Bella Heathcote), Kitty (Suki Waterhouse), Lydia (Ellie Bamber), and Mary (Millie Brady). In this version of 18th Century England, the countryside has been ravaged by a zombie outbreak. But amid the carnage and eating of brains, life goes on and young women must endeavor to marry well. To better survive the ravages of the undead, anyone with means sends their children to the orient to learn fighting arts. The wealthy send their children to Japan, and the wise send their children to China. The Bennet girls are alumni of the Shaolin temple. And where in previous incarnations of Jane Austin young ladies are playing harpsichord and doing needlepoint, the young ladies of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies are seen sharpening swords and cleaning flintlock pistols. They're also seen training for and engaging in combat with the legions of the walking dead. Sign me the Up .Yes the action sequences get a solid 9 out of 10. And the special effects are equally as good. But the truth is this movie is absolutely hilarious. It's funny because aside from adding zombies, kenjutsu and shaolin boxing, the writers kept everything else as faithful to Jane Austin as possible. I have seen Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen quite a few times and much of the dialogue is identical, indicating that both versions stayed close to Jane Austin's original text. When real dialogue from the Pride and Prejudice is given while girls are cleaning muskets and sparring, it becomes gut wrenchingly hilarious. Zombie action, comedy and horror with some classical literature mixed in.

Once Upon a Time in America," Complex gangster epic
","A former Prohibition-era Jewish gangster returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan over thirty years later, where he once again must confront the ghosts and regrets of his old life.The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut 4 hours & 11 minutes running time.Once Upon A Time In America is the crowning achievement of director Sergio Leone. It demands total concentration from beginning to end. However,those willing to submit will find it more than worth it.What really makes this film different is it's overwhelming melancholy. Leone's favourite loyalty/betrayal theme is there,but the film is also a study of memory,of a lost soul coming to terms with his past.The acting in this film is an absolute joy to behold. This is one of the best De Niro performances.While an unlikeable character, Noodles is a very interesting study of a broken life. He is matched every step of the way by an exceptional James Woods as Max. Woods has said that this is his favourite performance of his. The younger cast members, including a 12 year-old Jennifer Connelly, are especially effective during the flashback sequences.The combination of Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone is epic and the mix of actors are outstanding. Sergio Leone's epic crime drama is visually stunning, stylistically bold, and emotionally haunting.",10,2,9,20 March 2019

From the opening space arrival scene to the final battle, this film has it all in terms of a video feast for the eyes and excitement for the ears. Whether watching the 3D or 2D Blu-ray version of this film, the main things to take note of are outstanding black levels (the scene where Jake Sully is trapped in the Jungle at night) and the fantastic color layering in the animals, plants, and landscapes presented in the film.Also, although the soundtrack isn't the 'hit-em-over-the-head' variety, it is a great example of well-blended and properly balanced audio mixing, which makes it the perfect complement for the video presentation. Of course, the best way to watch this film is in 3D - the 3D doesn't push you away but draws you into the fantastical world of Pandora that James Cameron created.",10,1,1,22 June 2019

Joker," Joker (2019)
","Director: Todd Phillips
Writers: Todd Phillips, Scott Silver
Stars: Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances ConroyThis film for me is fantastic. Everything from the acting, to the directing, to the cinematography, sound and editing.In Gotham City, mentally troubled comedian Arthur Fleck is disregarded and mistreated by society. He then embarks on a downward spiral of revolution and bloody crime. This path brings him face-to-face with his alter-ego: the Joker. This film has a great sense of suspense, tension and dread. It really depicts how mental illness and society can tear people apart.The use of dark colors (Black, Brown, etc) really gives off the impression how gruesome and dirty Gotham can be. The use of music in this film really heightens the tension, the score really sells the transformation of the Joker. It is bone-chilling and gut-wrenching.Our leader through this world is the relentless Joaquin Phoenix, who gives what is very possibly the finest performance of his career. He summons the feeling that he was born to play this role.
The writers (Todd Phillips and Scott Silver) placed all their cards in the Joker character with the film relying on him in every scene, and phoenix delivers to an incredibly high standard. Joaquin Phoenix is truly Oscar Worthy in this film.I personally believe that this film will be a classic in years to come. Even though the events that are depicted have shown controversy, I think it will gain a cult following.92nd Academy Awards Films I have seen to date:

The Bridge on the River Kwai," The Bridge on the River Kwai amused and excited me.
","The Bridge on the River Kwai opens in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in Burma in 1943, where a battle of wills rages between camp commander Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) and newly arrived British colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness). Saito insists that Nicholson order his men to build a bridge over the river Kwai, which will be used to transport Japanese munitions. Nicholson refuses, despite all the various 'persuasive' devices at Saito's disposal. Finally, Nicholson agrees, not so much to cooperate with his captor as to provide a morale-boosting project for the military engineers under his command. The colonel will prove that, by building a better bridge than Saito's men could build, the British soldier is a superior being even when under the thumb of the enemy. As the bridge goes up, Nicholson becomes obsessed with completing it to perfection, eventually losing sight of the fact that it will benefit the Japanese. Meanwhile, American POW Shears (William Holden), having escaped from the camp, agrees to save himself from a court martial by leading a group of British soldiers back to the camp to destroy Nicholson's bridge. Upon his return, Shears realizes that Nicholson's mania to complete his project has driven him mad. Filmed in Ceylon, Bridge on the River Kwai won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for the legendary British filmmaker David Lean, and Best Actor for Guinness. It also won Best Screenplay for Pierre Boulle, the author of the novel on which the film was based, even though the actual writers were blacklisted writers Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, who were given their Oscars under the table.",8,1,2,14 February 2019

SCREENWRITERS: Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Wan
CAST: Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, Chang Hyae Jin
In the movie, we follow the Kim family who doesn't have much money. By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.Then the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!The cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing.So, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10",9,12,17,9 February 2020

Marriage Story," Review: 'Marriage Story' 9.5 /10
","With 'Marriage Story,' Writer/director Noah Baumbach goes to a dark place to assess the end of a life shared by two unhappy people, taking over two hours of screentime to assess the difficulties of a specifically challenged marital union.
'Marriage Story' is richly detailed, tastefully balanced with some needed comedy, and consistently attentive to the inner lives of the lead characters, who endure all the dehumanization of the divorce process in America. And yet, through the gloom and rising anxiety, Baumbach always preserves the heart of the moment, fleshing out the struggle of legal and emotional separation.The film stars Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. Laura Dern, Alan Alda, and Ray Liotta co-star.Johansson locates surprising areas of honesty for the character, working wonderfully with Baumbach's observant screenplay. Johansson plays an interesting foil, so long in the shadow of her high-profile husband despite being the face of his success in many ways. You can see the pain on her face, but it slowly turns defiant as she discovers a new life and a new (or perhaps rediscovered) sense of self in California. Her performance is Sublime.Driver has grown into one of the most respected actors of his generation a fearless and magnetic screen presence capable of making you believe everything he's saying no matter the context. He spends much of the film in a bemused haze as their divorce proceedings turn from civil to contentious, unable to understand how things went so sour despite his role in fracturing their relationship. It's the sort of skillful and soulful performance that's expected of him now, and he doesn't disappoint. Their chemistry is undeniable, and their performances sell the emotion of the script with ease.While Driver and Johansson take up most of the space in the room, there's still enough oxygen for some fun and quirky supporting turns, be it Wallace Shawn's unfathomably horny thespian or Merritt Wever and Julie Hagerty as Nicole's sister and mother, respectively. But it's Dern, decked out in slinky, aggressive power dresses and extreme heels, who effortlessly steals the movie away whenever she enters a scene. She has great fun sparring with Liotta and Alan Alda (as a grandfatherly and mostly inept lawyer who may not be up for the job. 'Marriage Story' is all about its performances, and those performances are flawless in every sense of the term.'Marriage Story' manages to come out on the other side with a sense of calm and understanding, making an extraordinarily difficult viewing experience worth the pain to see how people can keep living even when life is determined to beat all the spirit out of you. The result is a near-perfect piece of transcendent art and one of the true standouts of 2019. 9.5/10",9,5,7,1 February 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," The Silence of the Lambs 10/10
","1991 box office hit, psychological thriller, not for the squeamish. Based on the Thomas Harris novel and directed by Jonathan Demme. Nominated for 7 Oscar's, winner of the 5 major awards, Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay (not original screenplay), Actor and Actress.The Silence of the Lambs (1991) became the third film in Academy history to win the 'Big Five' Academy Awards for producing, directing, acting, and screenwriting following It Happened One Night (1934) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975).A rookie FBI trainee is tasked to interview an incarcerated psychopath for information into a recent crime spree.

This is a slick, first-rate masterpiece! I give it a 10/10.",10,0,0,16 February 2020
Mother!," Thought provoking and intelligent film...
","Odd, interesting, and definitely a niche film. The visuals are beautiful from start to finish and really help set the tone for the disturbing atmosphere of the film. I found this film very thought provoking. Jennifer Lawrence delivers an outstanding performance . Yes, 'Mother' may be construed as a morbid tale if perceived at its face value. There is a lot to unpack. It has quite the polarizing effect on my brain . Darren Aronofsky combines literature and bibliography to deliver a really heart breaking message about humanity. Definitely left of center entertainment.",8,1,1,27 September 2019
Ben-Hur," Ben-Hur (1959) A story of Christ: One of Hollywood's greatest Epics .

Though Ben-Hur has some religious overtones, it doesn't overdo it, and it manages to be fairly limited in its content. The film is a standout piece of cinema that blends drama and action beautifully and will satisfy people who enjoy grand cinematic epics.

The Purge," Violent Delights
","To sum it all up . I don't usually go for this type Action/Suspense /Crime & Thriller/ Horror genre . My motivation was my liking of actress 'Lena Headey' 300 , Terminator 'The Sara Conner Chronicles' GOT. Shame, shame , shame . And actress 'Adelaide Kane' The CW's 'Reign'. Well it turns out I am a fan 'now'of the uber violent , moments of satire and social commentary. Quote: The Purge is not subtle. But why should it be ? It's not a movie about class and morality, but about violence--our own. We are the audience, after all, and we must be purged ,too. This films were awesome. Do not piss me off .",6,0,1,15 October 2018

The Wizard of Oz," Must See
","This film is beyond classic that fully lives up to its status . The Wizard of Oz remains the weirdest, scariest, kookiest, most haunting story made. This Technicolor extravaganza contains such trippy imagery . Most of us first saw Wizard as children, but I, for one, appreciate it much more as an adult. I see flaws in most of the films I liked as a child but look back on as a grown up. Many of them can be enjoyed only for their nostalgia value. When I re-watch Wizard, I realize that as a kid I didn't have the full set of tools to enjoy it properly. The film has an enduring impression on me.Adapted from L. Frank Baum's timeless children's tale about a Kansas girl's journey over the rainbow, The Wizard of Oz opened at Grauman's Chinese Theater on August 15, 1939.Director: George Cukor and King Vidor and Mervyn LeRoy and Norman Taurog and Victor FlemingStarring: Bert Lahr, Billie Burke, Frank Morgan, Jack Haley, Judy Garland, Ray BolgerAdapted from L. Frank Baum's timeless children's tale about a Kansas girl's journey over the rainbow, The Wizard of Oz opened at Grauman's Chinese Theater on August 15, 1939.'Over the Rainbow' was nearly cut from the film; MGM felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being too far over the heads of the children for whom it was intended.The song 'Over the Rainbow' was ranked #1 by the American Film Institute in 2004 on the 100 Greatest Songs in American Films list.Included among the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the Top 100 Greatest American Movies.The horses in Emerald City palace were colored with Jell-O crystals. The relevant scenes had to be shot quickly, before the horses started to lick it off.The 'tornado' was a 35-foot-long muslin stocking, spun around among miniatures of a Kansas farm and fields in a dusty atmosphere.Dorothy's iconic red slippers now live at the Smithsonian Institution, and are so popular that the carpet in front of the attraction has had to be replaced numerous times due to wear and tear.
A recent study claimed that this is the most watched movie in film history, largely due to the number of television screenings each year as well as the various video/DVD/Blu-ray/4K releases, which have enabled children of every and all generations to see it.Judy Garland found it difficult to be afraid of Margaret Hamilton, because she was such a nice lady off-camera.It took upwards of 12 takes to have Toto run alongside the actors as they skipped down the yellow brick road.Terry (Toto) was stepped on by one of the witch's guards, and had a double for two weeks. A second double was obtained, because it resembled Toto more closely. Judy Garland very much wanted to adopt Terry after the two spent so much time together shooting the film. Unfortunately, the owner of the dog wouldn't give her up, and Terry went on to a long career in films. She died in 1945 and was buried in her trainer's yard.The Munchkins troupe came from Europe, many of them were Jewish and a number of them took advantage of the trip to stay in the US in order to escape the Nazis. Professional singers dubbed most of their voices, as many of them couldn't speak English and or sing well.The Munchkins were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in November, 2007.The movie's line 'I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!' was voted as the #99 movie quote by the American Film Institute (out of 100). 'Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore' was #4. 'There's no place like home.' was #23.Besides 'The Jitterbug' being completely cut, other songs were trimmed. 'Lions and tigers and bears (oh my!)' was a song rather than just a chant. The lion's 'If I Only Had the Nerve' was longer, and the Scarecrow had a long dance sequence in 'If I Only Had a Brain.'The Cowardly Lion's facial makeup included a brown paper bag. Bert Lahr couldn't eat without ruining his makeup. Tired of eating soup and milkshakes, he decided to eat lunch and have his makeup redone daily :)Many of The Wicked Witch of the West's scenes were either trimmed or deleted entirely, as Margaret Hamilton's performance was thought to be too frightening for audiences.",10,0,0,10 April 2020
