The Rock," dumb but fun
","A group of renegade U.S. Marines—led by highly decorated but deeply disgruntled general Harris—take over Alcatraz where they threaten to unleash chemical warfare on San Francisco with a deadly nerve gas. The only way to stop them is to lead an elite SEAL team onto the island with the help of long incarcerated British operative Connery—the only man to ever escape The Rock—and FBI biochemist Cage—who's never been in the field. The film's violent, high-energy action scenes provide a pure adrenaline rush, but it might have worked a lot better without shaky direction, lame comedy, or far-fetched plotting. It's still highly watchable, especially on a no-brainer level, and sure to deliver what's expected for fans of the Simpson-Bruckheimer team. **½",Null,1,2,8 May 2002
The Devil's Advocate," this is how you make a thriller
","Stylish, sexy, suspenseful thriller stars Reeves as an accomplished southern lawyer who's never been beaten; he travels to New York City to take a job with powerful legal mogul Pacino, but his once ideal life is soon turned upside down as he's plunged into a surreal, demonic world of lust, temptation, and vanity. Slick writing, direction, and an array of startling scenes, breathtaking effects, and dazzling performances make this an imaginative thriller quite unlike any other. Reeves gives one of his finest performances to date, aided immeasurably by a wild, wickedly over-the-top performance from Pacino and a first-rate supporting cast. Not for all tastes, but highly watchable indeed. ***Â½",Null,175,208,12 April 2002
Ford v Ferrari," a great showing with moments of pure thrill
","Supercharged sports drama based on the true story of retired American racer-turned-entrepreneur Carroll Shelby and fearless, confrontational British driver and mechanic Ken Miles who are employed by Henry Ford II and tasked with 'going to war' against auto magnate Enzo Ferrari, who in the 1960s refuses to concede his position as the dominant manufacturer with the 24 Hours of Le Mans fast approaching. Fittingly, the relationship between Shelby and Miles escalates through a series of masterfully shot, white-knuckled racing scenes. With the duo of Damon and Bale you get fire and ice, and director Mangold's staging of the high-octane competition is remarkably good, but this is also a very personal story that explores the behind-the-scenes world of motorsports in ways you wouldn't quite expect. The length of the picture makes it hard to maintain a consistent level of adrenaline-pumping excitement, but it's quite a ride nonetheless, and as an added bonus gives the talented Damon another opportunity to employ a Texas drawl, and the inimitable Bale to once again be transformative onscreen. ***",Null,0,0,13 May 2020
The Mask," one of Carrey's best
","Broad, inventive comedy stars Carrey as a repressed, down-on-his-luck banker whose once uneventful life is dramatically changed when he uncovers a mysterious ancient mask that brings out his innermost desires. After developing a close bond and gradual affection for a sexy songbird and prospective client (Diaz), he then tangles with her ruthless, lowlife gangster boyfriend (Greene). Lively, imaginative comedy with big laughs and nifty effects that almost make you feel like you're watching a live-action cartoon. The violence borders on extreme, but Carrey is in peak form and provides more than enough classic moments to make up for it. A must for Carrey fans. ***",Null,41,45,15 April 2002
Moneyball," a good story that needs a bit more thrust
","Following a disheartening loss in the 2001 playoffs, frustrated Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane is concerned over the impending departure of several high-profile free agents. In a small market with a limited budget, Beane is given the difficult task of trying to assemble a competitive team with limited resources. With the aid of a savvy Yale economics graduate, Beane tries a radical approach by using sabermetrics to recruit undervalued players-much to the chagrin of experienced scouts who feel like he's gutting the team and jeopardizing all of their jobs. Features many of the usual elements you'd see in other sports movies including pivotal games, fast-paced action on the field, beating the odds, the high of winning and the low of losing, etc.; but it lacks character development, and doesn't end with enough emotional punch. Will probably provide the most enjoyment to ardent baseball fans or those who know more about the real-life figure. **½",Null,0,1,19 December 2018
The Avengers," gives you what you want and then some
","Assemble! The highly anticipated Marvel Comics ensemble arrives on the big screen in style in this entertaining collaboration. Wastes no time setting things in motion as the iniquitous Loki (Hiddleston) descends to Earth to obtain the Tesseract and subjugate the human race. Out of options, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Jackson) recalls the Avenger initiative, uniting a corps of Earth's most remarkable heroes including self-obsessed Iron Man (Downey), humble Captain America (Evans), mighty Thor (Hemsworth), agile Black Widow (Johansson), adept Hawkeye (Renner), and volatile Hulk (Ruffalo), to make a definitive stand. Fun, flashy, and fast-paced, this epic-scale adventure delivers just what you'd want and expect with an unforgettable cast of characters, breathtaking action scenes, striking visual effects, a disarming sense of humor, and—most importantly—a good dose of heroism and humanity. Long, with a storyline that's fairly basic, but once it gets going you definitely won't mind; a rollicking good time for fans and non-fans alike, and a model for years to come. ***½",Null,0,2,4 May 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," delivers big, lots of fun
","Not to be confused for a sequel comes the second half of the fourth film by eccentric director Quentin Tarantino. Picks up where the first installment left off, with deadly bride Thurman going on a bloody and brutal mission to claim vengeance against the gang of assassins who left her for dead. Not as fast or flashy as the first installment, but with Tarantino running the show you know there'll be lots to grab your attention including witty, amusing dialogue, bizarre characters, and a spectacular training sequence. The finale doesn't quite deliver the impact you'd hope for, but the film is certainly memorable. As expected, not for the squeamish. ***",Null,6,15,29 April 2004
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," shifts tone yet still manages to be just as effective
","Having brought the most recent games to an abrupt ending, the resilient Katniss Everdeen and her few remaining allies are transferred to (thought) destroyed District 13, a dour, underground society that's isolated from the rest of Panem. Once there, Katniss reluctantly agrees to become the mockingjay, and act as a symbol of the continued uprising against the Capitol. Sensing her growing influence among the people and refusing to give justification to their actions, President Snow responds by declaring it a treasonous activity for anyone to embrace the mockingjay. Although not as action-oriented as its predecessors, this bleak and riveting saga still managers to tell a captivating story with political overtones and tense character interactions, as well as plenty of close calls and startling scenes, anchored by a first-rate performance from Lawrence who believably conveys her character's various stages of anger, determination and vulnerability. ***",Null,0,0,25 March 2019
Changeling," impressively made with many profound themes
","Jolie gives an impassioned and intensely vulnerable performance as a single mother in late 1920s Los Angeles who becomes grief-stricken when her nine-year-old son vanishes. It's not until several months pass when the publicity-seeking LAPD 'reunites' her with a missing child fitting the description. Publicly proclaiming the child not to be hers, she gets caught up in an intense melee with the less than ideal police who are willing to go to extreme measures to silence her. A riveting real-life story that encompasses corruption, abuse of power, mental coercion, criminal culpability, but most of all hope. A rare instance where you almost yearn for a conventional finale, but the biographical source material leaves a few subplots open-ended, and although some obvious anachronisms are thrown in for enjoyment of the viewer, it's still a praiseworthy showing--directed, produced, and scored by Clint Eastwood. ***",Null,0,0,2 May 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," a few quibbles yet still a worthy follow-up
","Captain Jack Sparrow is up to his old tricks yet again, this time embarking on a historic quest to discover the Fountain of Youth. In the midst of his quest, he crosses paths with an old flame (Cruz), and the pirate that all pirates fear—the dreaded Blackbeard (McShane). It's a race against time to reach the fountain when Sparrow discovers that not only is rival Barbossa (newly appointed as a British privateer) in pursuit of the fountain, but that the Spanish fleet has embarked on their own journey to reach the fountain as well. Fourth entry in the series is much more straightforward in story and in tone, and delivers some exciting action scenes, nifty special effects, and plenty of humor. It's never quite as rousing or as memorable as any of its three predecessors, but still entertains, and benefits from the presence of series veterans Depp and Rush. **½",Null,0,0,21 May 2011
Men in Black 3," belated sequel that could be better
","Despite being partners for nearly fourteen years, veteran MIB Agents J and K still don't seem able to communicate. The true value of their partnership is put to the test when K mysteriously vanishes, apparently the victim of a complex time traveling scheme. To save not only his partner, but all of humanity as he once knew it, Agent J must travel back to 1969 to stop a sinister alien from rewriting history. A good setup and some genuinely clever ideas would have worked better without so much forced humor and phony special effects. Straight man Jones is still reliable, comic relief Smith (after a four-year absence) shows some rust, but there is a highlight in Brolin who perfectly embodies the younger, still deadpan version of Agent K. Acceptable, just not as much fun as it could be. **Â½",Null,1,4,27 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," some of the same flaws as the first but still entertaining
","With much time having passed since their last daring adventure, the capricious sleuth Holmes and the fickle Dr. Watson reunite to celebrate Watson's long-awaited marriage, but the marriage quickly becomes a secondary concern when a formidable adversary--the maniacally brilliant Professor Moriarty--unleashes a devious, elaborate scheme that spells trouble for all those who oppose him. Slow going at first, and--like its predecessor--bogged down by a convoluted plot, but eventually kicks into gear with tense action scenes, nifty special effects, witty humor, ingenious twists, and of course the joy of seeing lead actors Downey and Law play their parts to perfection. ***",Null,0,2,24 December 2011
Gremlins," not bad but not for everyone
","An eccentric inventor is on a business trip in New York City and stops in Chinatown to try and find the perfect Christmas gift for his son. He comes across a unique, furry little species known as a mogwai and is warned of the possible danger involved if he doesn't follow the explicit rules of ownership. He gives it to his son as a pet, but the rules are broken and it spawns hordes of little green monsters that thrive on carnage and wreak havoc on the once idyllic little town of Kingston Falls. Well-crafted film has a creative premise, dazzling special effects, and laugh-out loud humor, but goes way overboard on violence and destruction. Not bad, just not entirely necessary in terms of its content. **½",Null,0,2,4 January 2007
The Incredible Hulk," a definite upgrade over the initial installment
","Research scientist Dr. Bruce Banner has the weight of the world on his shoulders; a genetics experiment gone haywire could potentially turn him into a monster if he loses his temper, thus making him the target of a relentless U.S. government. Living in isolation in South America, Banner seeks out a cure for his unstable condition, but in order to complete his research he must return to the States and seek out his long lost love (Tyler) with her bloodhound Army general of a father (Hurt) in tow. Reimagining of Ang Lee's 2003 Marvel Comics adaptation succeeds by avoiding needlessly convoluted story tangents, instead relying on a more straightforward approach with plenty of destructive action scenes, superior special effects, and characters who make sense. It wouldn't be as effective without the work of an excellent cast, with Norton perfectly vulnerable as Banner, Tyler warm and empathetic as Betty, Roth chilling and tenacious as Bronsky, Hurt callous and cold-blooded as General Ross. Climax is a bit noisy, but it's still solid entertainment. ***",Null,3,5,14 June 2008
Antz," not quite innocuous enough for kids but lots of fun
","Clever animated feature is a perspective of the world inhabited by ants. The focus of the story is on one woefully neurotic ant who rejects the colony's organized structure and chooses to embrace individualism. This leads him to clash with a callous general lusting for power, win the heart of the princess, and lead a journey to find an insect paradise which may or may not exist. The computer animation, visual effects, and wildly imaginative world of ants is something to truly marvel at, and you couldn't ask for a better cast of vocal talents. The script is much too edgy and complex for young children, but overall it's quite an impressive showing. ***",Null,0,0,13 February 2002

This leads him to cross paths with an elusive and remorseless arms dealer (a cold, calculating Hoffman) who's in possession of a potent weapon with unknown destructive capacity. An efficient, energetic and suspenseful third installment with a good, coherent story, exciting—though often loud—action scenes, and well-drawn characters. Cruise is required to do more acting here than in the previous two films, and you're drawn into the story as his two lives unexpectedly collide. ***",Null,0,1,4 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," enjoyable though it doesn't pack that extra punch
","Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jin and Obi-Wan Kenobi are sent across the galaxy to try and negotiate peace between the Galactic Republic and a shady band of separatist leaders. On the planet of Naboo, young Queen Amidala (Portman) tries to maintain peace among her people despite the ongoing crises. Having had to resort to aggressive negotiations, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan retreat to the distant planet of Tatooine where they encounter Anakin Skywalker, a remarkable young boy with a special gift. Swift, action-packed prequel has dazzling, inventive special effects, and quirky, memorable characters, but it lacks that old-fashioned, rousing since of adventure prevalent in earlier episodes. Even though it may not be anything truly remarkable, there's still much to please. **½",Null,0,4,11 December 2006
3:10 to Yuma," not as forceful or fiery as it could be yet a solid showing nonetheless
","Ben Wade and Dan Evans; two men on opposite sides of the law. Evans is a Civil War veteran-turned-impoverished rancher, husband, and father of two driven by an uncompromising moral conviction that he hopes will allow God to grant him a break; Wade is a nefarious, elusive, immoral outlaw whose reputation makes him a lucrative target for lawmen. Their interaction is the basis for this test of wills tale set in the Old West, as the rancher goes on a courageous mission to turn the outlaw in despite the insurmountable odds that face him, including the outlaw's bloodthirsty henchmen hot on his trail. Long, with direction that's a bit too leisure, but made worthwhile by strong acting and good storytelling. Aussie Crowe and Welshman Bale are an uncommon casting choice for a film of this genre, but they're both effective in creating believable characters. ***",Null,1,2,19 November 2007
Ali," well-cast but not very informative
","Disappointing biography of the man who called himself the greatest boxer of all time Muhammad Ali. The film traces his early days as a young boxer on the rise who created controversy for his outspoken persona, as well as his personal tribulations ranging from his refusal to enter the draft in Vietnam, his alliance with the Nation of Islam, his relentless pursuit of the world heavyweight title, and his amusingly feigned, protagonist-antagonist relationship with announcer Howard Cosell (Voight). Has the best cast that money can buy, including Smith who gives it his all as Ali, but the direction is shaky and not particularly insightful about the film's central character. Some good fight scenes and strong performances, but unfortunately not much else. **½",Null,0,1,12 February 2002
The Expendables 2," accept it for what it is and it should be a good time
","Big, bad, in-your-face sequel chronicles Barney Ross and his motley, roughneck crew as they're reluctantly recruited by the enigmatic Mr. Church to complete their latest assignment. What begins as a routine mission quickly turns into a personal vendetta when a deadly rival intercepts them. Toss logic, character development, and a 'plot' about weapons-grade plutonium aside; this macho, energetic, mindlessly entertaining action flick knows just how to please its target audience with rough and tough action sequences, cheesy one-liners, clever in-jokes, gratuitous casting, and amusingly over-the-top violence. Inevitable climactic showdown is a bit underwhelming, but any concoction that can put Rambo, Lionheart, John McClane, Terminator, and Walker, Texas Ranger all in the same film is sure to be some fun. **½",Null,2,7,19 August 2012

Convinced that she's the one for him, he has the difficult task of trying to get her to fall in love with him day after day. A reunion for stars Sandler and Barrymore who were an ideal romantic duo in The Wedding Singer; film pushes its unique premise to the limit, but it's sweet, funny, well-acted, and benefits from beautiful scenery. Suffers from some inane supporting characters and silly gags, but it's pleasant and charming in its own way. ***",Null,0,0,9 February 2007

Using his quick wit and charm, the young man eventually gets what he wants by convincingly impersonating various professions and writing phony checks. His actions leave a trail, and over the years he gets drawn into a cat and mouse game with a shrewd, no-nonsense federal agent (Hanks). Overlong, but slick and interesting with a terrific cast. The two leads are definitely fun to watch, and despite some dramatic overtones there are plenty of laugh-out loud moments. ***",Null,0,1,22 March 2003
The Hangover," not much on paper but the finished product is hard to dislike
","A simple, familiar setup is actually made worthwhile in this amusingly raunchy comedy. Four friends from Los Angeles, one soon to be married the other three his loyal groomsmen, take a trip to Las Vegas to have the time of their lives and give the would-be groom a night he'll never forget. It actually turns into a night they all forget when they awake the next morning with a bad hangover, no recollection of what occurred the previous night, and a series of misadventures that only grow stranger as they try to piece together the events of their wild 'bachelor party.' What initially sounds like a variation on the dreadful stoner comedy Dude, Where's My Car? actually produces some very clever results with more than enough vulgar and very funny gags, appealing characters, and a feel-good tone. Slow at first, but the more out of control the jokes get the more laughs they produce, even though it does arrive at an inevitable conclusion. Beyond that it's wildly good fun. ***",Null,1,4,13 June 2009

His only hope is to enlist the aid of a slick con artist (Goldberg) who possesses the uncanny ability to communicate with the living dead. A smart, entertaining, and heartfelt tale of love and redemption, with occasional touches of comedy and suspense, crafty special effects, and perfect performances from the three leads. Swayze is commanding as the unfortunate victim, Moore terrific as his lost love, Goldberg amusing and just right as a swindling spiritual adviser. A good mix of genres and memorable characters make this one really special. ***",Null,1,2,23 April 2002
Iron Man 3," has its flaws but still a lot of fun
","In a post-Avengers world, billionaire/genius/playboy/philanthropist Tony Stark is deeply troubled; the eye-opening events of New York City have left him with post-traumatic stress disorder and an obsessive, nearly uncontrollable urge to perfect his Iron Man technology. Not only does this put a strain on his blossoming relationship with Pepper Potts, it also makes him that much more vulnerable to his newest foe: The Mandarin, a wily terrorist whose reach knows no bounds. With his world slowly being torn apart, Stark must find it in himself to conquer his demons and put a stop to the latest threat. Much darker than its predecessors, both in story and in presentation, but the film's tone is a frustratingly uneven blend of broad comedy and deeply penetrating human drama. Not quite on target, but still entertaining thanks to a formidable cast, outstanding special effects, and high-octane action scenes that leave you on the edge of your seat. **½",Null,1,5,10 May 2013

After falling victim to the 'curse' herself, she goes on a mission to uncover the secret that will beat it and stop the inevitable from happening. Well-crafted thriller has an unusual premise that holds your interest, and has a few startling moments here and there, but it presents about four different endings, none of which are very satisfying. **½",Null,1,2,4 August 2003

Set in 1936 comes this breathlessly action-packed story starring Harrison Ford as a brilliant and brash archaeologist recruited by the U.S. government to retrieve the sacred Ark of the Covenant, a mysterious religious artifact which may or may not be a source of unspeakable power. The result is the adventure of a lifetime as he confronts brutal Nazis, matches wits with an arch rival (Freeman), and tries to make amends with his lost love (Allen), all the while eluding venomous snakes, fierce booby traps, and every other death-defying stunt imaginable! Overflowing with notable fight scenes, memorable characters, spectacular visuals, and one fatal escape after another, this remarkable film single-handedly sets the standard for the adventure genre.

Alice is a resourceful survivor and hardened warrior who battles against the reprehensible Umbrella Corporation, but before she can lead a definitive strike she has to locate the remaining survivors and Earth's last bit of infection-free haven. The series formula is strained, to say the least, but the film makes effective use of its violent, in-your-face 3-D action scenes, anchored by the scrappy, always reliable Jovovich in the lead.

With the help of a covert government team and one of a kind technology, he discovers a method to travel back in time to try and save her. Swift, intricate thrill ride is exciting, suspenseful, and well-performed, with a unique—if convoluted—story that grabs and holds you from the word go. The script may not be airtight and tends to ramble in its own logic, but it does entertain and adds yet another level of depth and intrigue to the 'mind teaser' genre. ***",Null,1,2,6 December 2006

","Intense, well-made adaptation of the Stephen King novel transplanted to the late 1980s about a group of outcast kids in the rural town of Derry, Maine who are united by common encounters with the titular being—a demonic, shape-shifting entity that is preying on local children. Emboldened by one another, they set out to kill the creature despite their initial fears, insecurities, and seemingly insurmountable odds. Even with the source material this isn't a traditional, clear-cut horror film, but more of a character-driven, coming-of-age story about friendship and the loss of innocence, with spooky, spine-tingling elements and acerbic, laugh-out loud humor in equal doses. Makes some unfortunate changes from the novel, but some surprisingly effective ones as well that are sure to unsettle the most ardent fans. Skarsgard is ferocious and creepy as the monstrous Pennywise, and kudos to the film's youthful, well-chosen cast for embodying characters that are actually three-dimensional. ***",Null,4,11,9 September 2017

Police chief Cruise has his life turned upside down when he learns that he's been detected to kill a man he never met. He then takes it on the lam to try and find flaws in the system and prove his innocence. Gripping, highly sophisticated thriller provides endless futuristic visuals, intriguing plot twists, and unexpected laughs. Starts off slow, but once it gets going you have to hang on as Spielberg's swift direction rarely lets up. Solid and suspenseful it keeps you guessing, though the finale is a bit protracted.

Enter Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil, an intelligence officer handpicked as a test subject for CRT, a rigorous SEAL training program with a 60% dropout rate for men in the military. Despite all the bureaucratic red tape in Washington, O'Neil eschews special treatment as she progresses through the unrelenting, nearly inhumane training regimen. The setup has potential, Moore is effective in the lead, and Mortensen has an especially intriguing role as her austere Master Chief, but despite holding your attention it all builds to a conventional, contrived, and unsatisfying finale.

Hawke is an idealistic rookie narcotics officer who's just been assigned to a new unit; Washington is his twisted, maniacal senior officer out to give him an up close and personal look at the gritty L.A. streets. The young officer's morale is put to the test as he's given an in-depth look at both sides of the law, and forced to make a choice as he's plunged into the cruel world of police brutality. Washington is intensely believable and charismatically over-the-top as a seasoned veteran who doesn't play by the rules, and Hawke stands tall as his inexperienced but steadfast subordinate. Mostly good writing and direction falter at the climax—and require a certain suspension of disbelief—but overall the movie packs a powerful punch. ***",Null,2,14,14 February 2002

While awaiting further instruction and contemplating their situation, one of them tries to take in the sights, while the other shows nothing but disdain for it. A unique and riveting blend of dark comedy and character study with intriguing, well-defined characters, edgy but amusing subject matter, and a variety of profound themes including purgatory, redemption, and honor among lowlifes, made all the more worthwhile by colorful acting and a vivid setting. ***",Null,0,0,26 November 2018

","There was the 1937 original...then the 1954 musical...then the 1976 musical...and now comes this remake and directorial debut of Bradley Cooper about a troubled but successful country music singer and his encounter with a struggling but immensely talented waitress/singer-songwriter. Their connection forms the basis of this film as they go through the inevitable ups and downs of show business, and the difficulties of maintaining a healthy relationship. Although it's easy to figure out the trajectory of this picture, it's still deeply moving thanks to the work of Cooper who gives a magnetic performance, is a credible vocalist, and provides sure-handed direction, as well as Lady Gaga who's captivating in the dual role of actor and singer.

","Spectacular, visually stunning space odyssey/suspense thriller focusing on a medical specialist (Bullock) on her first space shuttle mission, and a veteran astronaut (Clooney) commanding his final expedition, and their arduous journey after an accident leaves them stranded in outer space. With a setup that initially seems indistinguishable from other films in this genre there's reason to be skeptical, but it immediately grabs you by the collar with a taut, multilayered story of strength, faith, and survival, and overwhelms you with some of the most arresting visual effects ever put on film. If there were ever a case to justify using 3-D for a mainstream Hollywood movie, this would definitely be it! Bullock easily gives the finest performance of her career, creating genuine pathos and conveying a gamut of emotions that have not yet been seen in her previous efforts.

Fearing the safety of her elderly father, the impetuous Mulan embarks on a daring mission to take his place. Well-crafted and interesting in spots, with a recurring theme of sexism, along with some striking animation, but the film revels more in its comedic overtones (specifically Murphy's wisecracking dragon sidekick Mushu who seems suited for another film) taking away from the presumably more serious central theme.

The two must quickly learn to adapt to one another after they're drawn into the dark side of human nature when they stumble upon an extraordinarily clever serial killer who punishes perpetrators of the seven deadly sins by turning the sin against them! Some of the film's graphic elements are so disturbing, so gut-wrenching, and so vividly realized that the film is off-putting at times, yet it's so captivating, so clever, and made with such realistic skill and ingenuity that you have to applaud the work of all those involved.

Unbreakable," despite a good setup it just doesn't payoff
","Mixed bag about an ordinary, everyman security guard who lives with the feeling that his life is unfulfilled even though he's married with a bright young son. While riding the train one morning, his life is drastically changed when it derails causing a horrific accident. Not only is he the lone survivor, he's also miraculously unharmed and meets an enigmatic comic book collector who tries to convince him that he's a unique being. Intriguing but ponderous and slightly silly story has a plot that holds your interest, and two capable leads, but it takes itself too seriously, turns overly melodramatic in the final act, and provides an unsatisfying conclusion. Willis and Jackson are both convincing, but when it's all said and done it just feels like a big tease. **",Null,1,2,12 March 2007
Fight Club," grabs and holds you but lacks a really strong ending
","Surreal, mind-boggling story from director David Fincher about a burned-out businessman who's fed up with his life and looking for something new. He does this by first developing a liaison with a dissolute woman, then by 'befriending' a slightly deranged soap salesman who helps him form an underground network of fight clubs where grown men relieve their frustrations by beating each other senseless...but that's only the beginning. Good direction, stunning visuals, and an engrossing story are bolstered by a perfectly stilted performance from Norton, a wildly over-the-top performance from Pitt, and a finely tuned performance from Bonham Carter, but the finale doesn't make much sense and seems tacked on. Still, there's plenty to take in, and a lot of intriguing, satirical viewpoints about society's balance of power. **½",Null,0,2,15 February 2002

An admirable affection for his favorite waitress (Hunt), his unorthodox, like-hate relationship with his gay neighbor (Kinnear), an unexpected and unlikely bond with his neighbor's little dog; all of these things and more accompany him on his tumultuous, funny, and emotional journey as he slowly but surely discovers his own humanity.

Darkest Hour," any shortcomings are redeemed by top-notch acting
","In May of 1940, the Wehrmacht continues to encroach across Western Europe causing the British Parliament to lose faith in the leadership of Neville Chamberlain. The search for a successor begins, but the only candidate that opposing parties will accept is the cantankerous, hard-drinking, cigar smoking Winston Churchill-a polarizing figure who is without principle and insufferable to some (including his wife Clemmie), and a tough, uncompromising leader to others. Tension becomes especially high amongst government officials as they try to resolve the conflict at Dunkirk. Director Wright plunges viewers right into the heart of old English politics with crucial decision-making, volatile character interactions, and an imminent threat of annihilation, but without a doubt the real highlight is an electrifying Oldman who embodies the many shades of Churchill, from surly and stubborn, to doubtful and ultimately good-hearted. The anticlimactic finale is a bit of a letdown, but the acting alone makes it worth the viewing experience. ***",Null,2,2,17 November 2018

Extremely dark, often tragic, at times unbearable story explores the violent and graphic depths of a life gone wrong, but it's well told and acted with conviction. Theron—rendered unrecognizable by heavy makeup—is stunning in the lead, and Ricci hits just the right note as her impressionable companion.

","From director Christopher Nolan comes this perplexing story of a man seeking justice in the form of revenge. Guy Pearce stars as an insurance agent on a mission to seek out the man who killed his wife. Unfortunately he suffers from a mental condition that prevents him from forming new memories, drawing you into an unforgettable, mind-boggling journey as he struggles to remember who he is, his life before the accident, and more importantly—whom he can trust. A unique, elaborate, and mesmerizing movie experience; director Nolan showcases a one of a kind crime caper in which the lead character battles himself and those around him in order to avenge his wife, even though the final payoff may elude him completely! To watch this film and experience the descent into the mind of this character is truly exhilarating; don't you dare miss a single minute of this multilayered, provocative story in which a new plot twist is added almost every minute.

Inglourious Basterds," a wild ride; film shows just how much fun a director can have
","That wacky Tarantino is at it again, this time making his mark in the historical genre by putting a campy spin on the events escalating behind the lines of WWII. Set in 1940s, Nazi-occupied France, the film spotlights a group of rugged, rebellious Jewish-American militia whose mission is to use anarchy to turn the tide of the war by killing and scalping as many Nazis as they can. Their efforts eventually lead to a golden opportunity to end the war once and for all...but that's only the beginning. Director Tarantino's thumbprint is all over this film and he's in fine form using a historical backdrop to create his own warped, hysterically over-the-top universe that's full of screwy dialogue, zany, larger-than-life characters, and audacious subject matter that can make you laugh and squirm in equal doses. Pitt is in rare form as the brash leader, intentionally bordering on caricature, and French actress Laurent is an alluring femme fatale, meanwhile Austrian actor Waltz is nothing short of spectacular as a wily, hawkeyed Nazi colonel. It goes on much longer than it needs to, and it's clearly not an accurate representation of history, but boy is it entertaining. ***½",Null,1,6,13 September 2009

An impressive historical picture from director Spielberg with a powerful and moving performance by Hounsou, an exceptional supporting cast, and some of the most truly graphic slave ship scenes imaginable.

","In a distant galaxy, an elite Kree military unit known as Starforce trains and defends to protect their way of life against an alien race known as Skrulls. When a vital mission goes awry, a junior member of Starforce who continually struggles to keep her emotions in check finds herself stranded on Earth in the 1990s. Trying to be the best version of herself in preparation for an intergalactic conflict between the Kree and the Skrulls, she's also deeply troubled by recurring dreams of her past life. The rudimentary storyline isn't compelling enough to make this soar, and the continuous use of flashbacks makes for an uneven narrative, but it still benefits from some sensational visual effects, thrilling action scenes, a welcomed sense of humor, and good chemistry between lead actors Larson and Jackson. There's also a lot of 90s sentiments to please nostalgic fans, and the expected references to tease dedicated MCU fans moving forward. **Â½",Null,0,9,10 March 2019

Soon she and a group of survivors, including a hardened police officer, a young man and his pregnant wife, and a callous security guard, must band together inside the town mall to try and survive. Pretty good for a remake, but the film has its ups and downs; fans of blood and gore will certainly get their money's worth, and the script certainly has a warped since of humor, but the story and characters are never fully fleshed out, and the dialogue is often clunky.

The issue is whether Stark can get it together in time to preserve his reputation, protect those around him, and protect himself as well. Action scenes are a blast, special effects are first-rate, and Downey adds plenty of panache, but there are too many characters, too many subplots, not many surprises, and it's just not quite as much fun to watch as its predecessor.

With approximately ninety years remaining until they reach their destination, they're forced to make the most of where they are despite their inevitable doom. An intriguing blend of romance, sci-fi odyssey, and suspense thriller, this features some genuinely powerful moments, and the interstellar effects are a wonder to behold, but it all unravels and resorts to convention in its final act.

To punish the districts for a past rebellion, each year the Capitol selects two tributes (one male, one female) between the ages of twelve and eighteen to compete in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death where there can only be one survivor. To protect her younger sister, sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, a skilled archer from District 12, volunteers to join the games where she's forced to compete against the various tributes, among them fellow District 12 member Peeta Mellark. Intense and exciting with creative action scenes, a vivid portrait of this bleak world, and a well-chosen cast across the board with Lawrence compelling in the central role. The violence is clearly watered-down, and the story loses some of its thrust in the third act, but the overall results are still impressive. ***",Null,1,1,25 March 2019

Wanting to return to civilization as they once knew it, a group of scientists use advanced technology to transport a convict back to the 1990s to find the source of the virus and stop it from spreading. This long, bizarre, complex, dizzying, and unique scientific saga certainly holds your interest, with a lot of innovative ideas, dazzling effects, and good performances, but its nuanced vision of the time traveling process is confusing and difficult to flesh out, especially at the finale.

Exciting, rip-roaring high seas adventure goes on too long, but delivers the goods with terrific set design, lively performances, eye-popping visual effects, and a better script that throws out new perils at just the right moments.

Meanwhile the seemingly self-assured Gosling finds his own personal challenge when he meets beautiful 'game changer' Stone, an aspiring law student who sees through his smooth-talking routine. What initially begins as a straightforward, occasionally raunchy comedy eventually shifts tone into a more serious, family-oriented drama; this throws things off kilter a bit, but there are some unexpectedly effective twists, good lines, genuine laughs, a meaningful (if familiar) message, and when cast to perfection like this it's really hard to miss.

Though peaceful at first, the trip quickly spirals into a nightmare when their home is invaded by counterparts of themselves...to reveal any more would be both confusing and a spoiler. With an intriguing set up and sure-handed direction the film grabs and holds you, has some clever moments, and is genuinely chilling at times, but the longer it goes on the more the tension dissipates, and too much time is spent preaching a message rather than telling a story that avoids all the usual horror movie clichés.

Wisely never taking things too seriously, this is a vibrant, voluble take on the whodunit genre with a unique assortment of characters, clever twists and turns, and an ending that doesn't cheat the audience.

","Rambunctious comedy features Culkin—in a star-making performance—as a troublesome but clever and precocious eight-year-old whose dysfunctional family inadvertently leaves him behind after they leave town for the Christmas holiday. He makes the most of his situation by doing all the things he couldn't do without his family's permission, but then unexpectedly finds himself defending his home from local wet bandits Pesci and Stern. Provides some poignant messages about the importance of family and friendship, but is most likely to be remembered for its hilarious slapstick, goofy bad guys, and a very appealing young star. ***",Null,1,1,18 March 2002

","In 2001, Keaton, Ruffalo, McAdams, and James are among a small team of journalists at the Boston Globe who research and publish investigative articles. When new editor Schreiber joins the staff and encourages them to follow a lead regarding child sexual abuse among the Boston Archdiocese, they uncover more than they could have ever anticipated regarding a systematic pattern of abuse and the ensuing cover-ups. Based on the true account of the Boston Globe's investigation that earned them a Pulitzer Prize in Public Service this is sensitive subject matter to be sure, but the story is compelling and holds you every step of the way, and is further elevated by a first-rate cast of actors. Not for everyone, but a fine showing regardless. ***",Null,0,1,18 November 2018
Terminator Salvation," there's potential here but the execution is lacking
","The year is 2018; the setting is a bleak, post-apocalyptic world that has been ravaged by an ongoing war between humans and the deadly machine empire Skynet. John Connor is a scrappy and resourceful survivor who's prophesized as the chosen warrior to lead the resistance and defeat the machine empire, but in order to do so he's going to have to live long enough to find and protect Kyle Reese. The threat of annihilation grows with each passing day, but Connor finds help from an unlikely source. What could've been a worthy addition to the Terminator franchise is unfortunately weakened by unappealing characters, uninspired performances, lazy dialogue, and shaky direction that fails to add any real tension to its numerous action scenes. Shows signs of life with an exciting finale, but the film seems to be lacking a certain spark and would have benefited from stronger acting. Bale—strangely—is fairly cardboard as the heroic leader, but not even his best performance could make up for all of the film's shortcomings. **",Null,0,1,30 May 2009

What could've easily been a run-of-the-mill cop flick is instead elevated into a stylish, atmospheric, and consistently gripping psychological thriller thanks to a top-notch cast, taut direction, and superb storytelling.

Aquaman," enjoyable despite being fairly routine
","His father a lighthouse keeper, his mother an Atlantean queen, Arthur Curry, aka Aquaman, is a half-breed hero with astonishing powers that make him a valuable asset to surface dwellers, and the rightful king of the undersea nation-a role which he continually refuses to accept. When his half-brother Orm unveils a scheme to declare war on the surface, Arthur has no choice but to reclaim his birthright if he wishes to protect those he loves. Latest addition to the DCEU is chock-full of conventional elements like action, globe-trotting adventure, romance, and cheeky humor (much of which you can see coming a mile away) yet somehow still manages to be engaging thanks to effective casting, a spectacular view of the aquatic world, and a good decision by director Wan to never take things too seriously. Glib, brawny Momoa is perfectly cast, and there's also good supporting roles for Heard as the obligatory love interest, and Dafoe as the traditionalist mentor. Despite the familiarity (of which there is much) this is more fun than you'd expect. **Â½",Null,0,1,7 April 2019

He's sure that she's the one, but she thinks it's all just a fantasy. Use of narration can be viewed as either an asset or a liability depending on your point of view, but it's still an intimate, well-crafted, and refreshingly unconventional story that examines the many intricacies of love. The two leads have a nice, unforced chemistry and the film's off-the-wall storytelling technique make it a lot more interesting than it otherwise would have been. ***",Null,0,0,23 December 2018

With the support of her parents and closest girlfriend, Juno finds a suitable couple to serve as adoptive parents, but still struggles to maintain a 'normal' life when the burden of pregnancy turns out to be much more difficult than she originally anticipated. Sweet, quirky, consistently funny film takes a familiar setup and makes the most of it with believable scenarios, well-drawn characters, perfect casting, and some of the snappiest, most colorfully amusing vernacular in quite some time.

There's Jack Vincennes (Spacey), a glamour boy and seeker of fame who runs scams for a sleazy tabloid; Bud White (Crowe), a volatile and hardened brute never afraid to dish out his own brand of justice; Ed Exley (Pearce), an ambitious and self-righteous golden boy trying to rise above the reputation of his scummy precinct.

Now the race is on as the world's remaining survivors must band together in order to escape the coming of a new ice age. The script strains credibility, as expected from most films in this genre, but there are plenty of suspenseful moments, destructive action scenes, and dazzling special effects to hold your interest.

They must also thwart the treacherous Lord Beckett who's using his control over Davy Jones' heart to try and eliminate the remaining Pirate Lords and rule the high seas. Overlong, exposition-heavy script fluctuates between confusion and coherency, but still manages to entertain with spectacular visual effects, rousing action scenes, an exciting, over-the-top climax, and big time laughs thanks to a first-rate cast, especially Depp as the irrepressible, larger-than-life Sparrow. Much rougher and tougher than the previous two installments making it too intense for the youngest audiences, but adults shouldn't have any complaints.

Don Jon," watchable though sure to be off-putting to some
","A unique hybrid of romance, comedy, social commentary, and character study with actor/writer/director Joseph Gordon-Levitt in peak form as the titular character, a suave Jersey stud who can pull 'dimes' at the drop of a hat, but prefers to indulge himself in the salacious world of internet pornography. He reaches a crossroads when he meets two vastly different women who dramatically alter his once routine life. With graphic subject matter and explicit dialogue this is definitely not for the faint of heart, but it's laser sharp in its observations, the characters make sense, the acting is strong, and the laughs are abundant. Lead actors Gordon-Levitt, Johansson, and Moore are all completely believable, but the film's resolution is just a bit too hasty and a bit too pat to keep it from scoring a home run. Still, it's an ambitious and impressive showing from a novice film director. **½",Null,3,9,29 September 2013

Realizing the full extent of the danger that awaits him, Wilson attempts to rally a team to his cause. Flip, amusing, and well-cast with an assortment of colorful new characters (especially Brolin who takes no prisoners as the nomadic Cable), this is a pretty good second helping for fans of the original, but with the exception of some clever in-jokes aimed squarely at lead actor Reynolds, it's never as shocking or as hilariously self-referential as the first one, though dedicated fans will likely overlook any shortcomings. **",Null,0,1,7 June 2018

This attracts the attention and resistance of Stewart's X-Men, a heroic gang of mutants who believe that the two groups can live in peace and harmony. Unremarkable, occasionally cheesy, but the story is good, and there are many engrossing and believable moments showing how humans fear and discriminate against that which they do not understand. Fans should have a great time, yet there's still enough razzle-dazzle effects to satisfy a few others. ***",Null,0,0,17 April 2002
Spider-Man 3," some good things but it never comes together
","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½",Null,229,368,8 May 2007

Thor—imprisoned on the other side of the galaxy in a race against time—must outlast the Hulk in a contest of champions while the fate of Asgard hangs in the balance. Despite a familiar setup, this silly and bombastic sequel completely veers from the style and tone established by its predecessors and features some exciting action scenes, unique new characters, laugh-out loud humor, and enough references to remind audiences that despite the absurdly in-joke tone of the film that it still is—in fact—a part of the larger Marvel Universe. Hemsworth looks to be having more fun here than in any other of his previous outings as the hero, and both Blanchett and Goldblum have a whale of a time in their colorful supporting roles.

Having attended a motivational seminar, he reluctantly enters a covenant to say yes to every opportunity, leading to surprising results (including crossing paths with hip nonconformist Deschanel). You know just by hearing the setup that this creates all sorts of possibilities, and would usually be perfect comic fodder for Carrey who can play zany and outrageous in his sleep, but the film lacks a certain spark and never quite takes off the way it should. Director Reed makes a fundamental error in not fully unleashing his lead actor's considerable talents, but it's still pleasing despite the lukewarm results. **½",Null,0,0,7 December 2018

With no place to turn and no good options, a motley group of survivors must elude flesh-eating zombies as they make their way across the desolate west hoping to make a new start. Leaden script with a nonexistent plot is redeemed only partially by Jovovich who's in good form as a scrappy, take-no-prisoners survivor, but beyond that it's just a senseless exercise in violence, special effects, and noise. A perfect addition to the undiscriminating/no-brainer genre. *½",Null,8,18,24 September 2007
The Prestige," holds you but isn't always easy to follow
","Intricate, serpentine thriller—not a surprise since it's co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan—set toward the turn of 20th century London about two ambitious magicians, one a charismatic seeker of fame with a penchant for showmanship, the other a sly and dazzling illusionist, who are devoted partners until their greatest trick goes tragically awry. Torn apart by their resentment and mutual desire to be the best, they become bitter enemies who'll stop at nothing to learn each other's secrets, and their rivalry escalates into a lifelong obsession of deceit and sabotage. Slow at first, but the story is interesting, the two leads are formidable (Jackman lively and flamboyant, Bale mysterious and subdued), and there's a lot of chicanery and hocus pocus to please the eye, but the plotting is confusing, almost incomprehensible at times, and the ending feels contrived. Still, director Nolan does a good job of building suspense and intrigue, but you'd probably have to watch it multiple times to appreciate all the skill and craft. **½",Null,0,0,28 March 2007

With the help of another futuristic warrior (Biehn), she must stay alive in order to ensure the future of humanity. Fast, forceful, energetic, violently action-packed thriller is entertaining every step of the way, with a spine-chilling performance from Schwarzenegger as an emotionless killing machine so potent that he garners more favoritism than the hero!

In the midst of a brutal blizzard, the titular strangers seek shelter at a local tavern but it soon becomes clear that not everyone is what they seem as startling revelations come to the fore. By now you know that whenever you hear this director's name and get pulled into his world that nothing will go quite the way you expect it to, but despite a flavorful cast of characters, vivid setting, and the expected scintillating dialogue, this is a surprisingly unmemorable effort; begins with an effectively tense and teasing build-up, but goes on way too long, with a final act that's relentlessly (and needlessly) violent, ugly, and mean, instead of twistedly fun like so many of the director's previous efforts. Playing out like some weird amalgam of Reservoir Dogs, Django Unchained, and Clue, this is self-indulgent to a fault, and doesn't provide a very resounding resolution given the excruciating length of time it takes to tell this story. **½",Null,4,14,10 January 2016

Often tragic, often funny, how much of it is actual fact versus fiction we may never really know, but it's always involving and bolstered by believable scenes on the ice and faultless performances by its cast. Robbie perfectly embodies the central character in all of her permutations, Stan (primarily of Marvel fame) shows some profound acting chops as her 'allegedly abusive' husband, and Janney is simply remarkable as her stern, indifferent mother.

The latest in a long line of tepid Hollywood sequels; the cast may have had fun making this film but that doesn't mean the audience will as it drags on for over two hours with endless story lulls, self-conscious humor, and banal dialogue. One particularly embarrassing in-joke falls flat and leaves you wondering just how desperate the producers were to earn cheap laughs.

These characters, their lives, and their inevitable encounters with one another provide the foundation for the film, as it gives viewers a believable, in-depth look at the anger, harshness, and ignorance of bigotry and race relations in America.

Despite how far-fetched it may seem, this is actually inspired by true events (though some obvious artistic liberties are taken) and naturally Lee uses this as a platform to inject some of his own political propaganda, but it's a fascinating story with fine performances, invigorating dialogue, and much more humor than you'd expect from a film with this type of subject matter.

When a new and well-equipped criminal enterprise emerges in New York City, Peter naturally wants to try and end the threat, but quickly gets in over his head--much to the chagrin of reluctant mentor Tony Stark. Despite being the sixth go-round, this is a surprisingly refreshing take on the titular character--wisely sidestepping the origin tale formula--and presenting a unique story with a lighthearted tone, coming-of-age themes, and just enough twists and references to weave it within the greater framework of the burgeoning MCU. Holland is wonderful, bringing a youthful ambition and naiveté that hasn't been seen in previous incarnations of the character, while veteran Keaton is a chilling antagonist.

Although initially reluctant, the crew reassembles when the job becomes personal. In this type of film it's futile to stop and criticize the far-fetched logic, absurd action sequences, weak acting, and threadbare story which is nothing more than a ploy to pull viewers along a supercharged ride, so if you can turn your brain off for the sufficient running time then the film delivers exactly what you'd expect.

The setup is good, the cast is game, and there are some visually impressive feats, but the execution is surprisingly mediocre; action scenes are redundant, key characters are either never developed or left completely in the background, and the film never really gives you anyone to root for. Smith is in good form, and Robbie really goes for broke with her giddily insane persona, but beyond that it's a loud, uneven mishmash of music, action, and gratuitous cameos, with occasional touches of colorful dialogue and humor. Starts strong, but all the fun drains away long before the finale, making this another miss for the expanding DCEU. **",Null,0,2,7 August 2016
Shutter Island," skillfully made but doesn't quite hit the mark
","Set in the 1950s comes this combination horror film and psychological thriller. Teddy Daniels is a highly intelligent U.S. Marshal with a troubled past. Partnered for the first time with fellow marshal Chuck Aule, he travels to the mysterious Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando, a murderess patient who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane. Upon his arrival to the island, he learns bit by bit that not all is as it seems. Scorsese does an excellent job of creating a creepy atmosphere of tension and suspense, and DiCaprio is also very good, but the story depends on a hook that, when you think about it, doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Still, there's a lot to take in, and the film holds your attention from the moment it starts. **½",Null,0,2,10 August 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," more than just a comic book adaptation
","It's two years later and a disillusioned Steve Rogers, now residing in Washington D.C., continues his shaky affiliation with S.H.I.E.L.D. while still struggling to find his place in the contemporary world. Adapting to modern society becomes the least of his worries when he finds himself caught up in a high-end conspiracy, while also coming toe-to-toe with a mysterious and formidable adversary known as the Winter Soldier. Unsure of whom he can trust, Rogers reluctantly teams with Natasha Romanoff and enlists the aid of war veteran Sam Wilson to unravel an elaborate web of deception and complete the task at hand. A tense and palpably real political thriller masquerading as a superhero movie, this one delivers the goods with gritty, all-too-believable situations, slick plotting, startling revelations, fantastic visuals, and well-staged action scenes that are powerfully good. Raises a lot of interesting questions and moral dilemmas that are especially poignant in this day and age, and guaranteed to please fans looking for more than just the traditional comic book fare. ***½",Null,1,3,5 April 2014
Life of Pi," an adventure you won't soon forget
","Piscine 'Pi' Patel, a middle-aged Indian man in Canada, recalls his life story to a curious novelist, tracing his early youth from being born and raised in a zoo, his introduction to Islam and Christianity, and a life-changing event at age sixteen when he was stranded in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific with his only companion being a fully grown Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Through a series of surreal, almost dream-like flashbacks, Pi conveys a fascinating story of hope, faith, survival, and ultimately friendship while combating the loneliness and danger of his remarkable journey. Based on the novel by Yann Martel, director Ang Lee creates a gripping and visually striking world that allows you to accompany this resilient young man through his arduous journey, and profound, allegorical themes that transcend the usual survival genre.

Nowhere near as slick or stylish as Ocean's Eleven the film is slow going at times, with a tendency to jump from one plot twist to the next without much transition, but it's still good-natured fluff with a good cast and some solid laughs along the way. The script can't bear close scrutiny, but it's enthusiastically performed—with Pacino making a welcomed addition as Bank—and a definite improvement over the laughable Ocean's Twelve. **½",Null,1,3,11 June 2007

Still stubborn and conceited enough to believe that he can defy the odds, Strange embarks on a journey of healing, seeking tutelage from the Ancient One where he learns about the metaphysical world, alternate dimensions, and the all-powerful Eye of Agamotto. Extremely well-crafted chapter of the MCU is a visual candyland of mysticism and magic, with phenomenal visual effects, thrilling action scenes, a colorful assortment of characters, and a witty, mischievous sense of humor.

Interstellar," doesn't go out with a bang but still entertains
","Having made his mark in cerebral explorations and superhero adventures, director Nolan takes his unique talents to sci-fi odyssey in this gripping and thought-provoking story of hope, survival, and love. In an unspecified future, Earth has become an agrarian society without formal government structure and little time left to sustain human life. McConaughey is a former NASA test pilot-turned-farmer and father of two who becomes the 'chosen one' to lead an expedition to the edge of Saturn when a wormhole is discovered that could be the key to finding the next habitable planet. Even with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, he's given the nearly impossible choice of saving the world or saving his own family. With a director of Nolan's ambition at work you know there'll be plenty to take in as the film boasts a compelling story, marvelous visual effects, enthralling action scenes, and the sheer strength of the human spirit; if only it didn't turn overly sentimental and revert to convention in its final act. McConaughey gives a passionate, emotionally-charged performance-one of his very best, and Chastain is also riveting as his headstrong, determined daughter; their powerful performances, along with the aid of a well-chosen supporting cast, help overcome any sloppy, melodramatic storytelling. ***",Null,1,3,9 November 2014

The second half traces their deadly mission through combat in Vietnam, where they try to utilize their dehumanizing training experiences to battle the enemy. The hardships of war shown in the film's latter half are more familiar, but as a whole the film is compelling, insightful, and extremely well-acted.

Bleak, isolated, and provocative drama from director Martin McDonagh is perfectly cast and completely unpredictable, with scintillating dialogue, tense character interactions, and a believable examination of human nature in the most dire of circumstances.

American Sniper," gripping portrayal of a legendary serviceman
","Intense biographical war drama based on the memoirs of Chris Kyle, a U.S. Navy SEAL sniper who became the deadliest marksmen in U.S. history while serving multiple tours of duty in the Iraq War. The film traces his early days in Texas as a hunter and failed rodeo cowboy, until the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings inspire him to enlist. A dedicated serviceman, his commitment to fulfill his duty drastically affects his psyche, making it that much more difficult to maintain a regular life with his wife and children. Like many films of this genre there's likely some artistic liberties that were taken, but the story is still compelling, more for the quiet, intimate scenes where the gung-ho Kyle wrestles with his demons, rather than the battle scenes which cover more familiar ground. Eastwood's transitions and passage of time aren't especially smooth, but they're compensated for by realistic, thoughtful depictions of post-war veterans struggling to adjust to civilian life, perfectly embodied by a transformative, tour de force performance from Bradley Cooper. ***",Null,1,24,10 March 2019

However the intense media hype, public mockery from the champion Creed, and a discovery that 'normal' life isn't all that it's cracked up to be draw him back into the ring for a highly publicized rematch.

Meanwhile, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi travels across the galaxy where he discovers construction of a secret, unauthorized clone army.

His life is still idyllic thanks to the support of his wife and daughter despite their well-founded reservations about his safety. When a personal tragedy occurs, he begins to unravel and his once prosperous career comes to an ignominious end. Some intentionally painful and ugly moments both in and out of the ring give you a sense of the dark path the lead character must walk down and endure, but it follows a much too familiar trajectory and builds up to a finale that you can see coming long before it ever gets there.

Fearing his technology will fall into the wrong hands--thus creating worldwide ramifications--Pym finds his solution in the form of Scott Lang, an ex-con looking to go straight. One of the more unique additions to the MCU this throws out some good (if derivative) special effects and nifty action scenes, but it stays strictly within the confines of the origin tale formula making it difficult to shake an inherent feeling of déjà vu. Lacks a compelling villain or well-drawn supporting characters, and fails to take any real chances, but has enough gratuitous cameos and in-jokes to keep dedicated fans interested, and goes a long way on its sense of humor.

","It's the early 1940s and the United States military has employed all of its resources to try and bring about the downfall of the Nazi regime. Steve Rogers is a feeble but courageous young man from Brooklyn who's only goal in life is to join the military. Having been continually passed up for enlistment, he volunteers to become the first test subject of a 'super soldier' program that grants him enhanced strength and ability. Not only does this boost the morale of his country, it also makes him the only suitable candidate to combat the Hydra--a scientific Nazi faction led by the maniacal and astonishingly powerful Red Skull. The latest comic book adaptation to be set in the Marvel universe has special effects to please the eye, a vivid sense of time and place, and the expected action scenes, but without a compelling story, a sense of wonder or excitement, or an effective climactic showdown, it feels like just another run-of-the-mill origin tale. Evans acquits himself well as the hero, and Jones provides some fun as his ornery commanding officer, but both Weaving and Atwell are underused as the villain and love interest.

A smörgåsbord of pure acting ability, interesting characters, effective twists, brilliant dialogue that recalls Tarantino, and plenty of tense, heated exchanges and character interactions that test the limits of each actor's ability. A bit on the long side, and not always easy to follow, but darkly humorous and always engaging, though the plot caves in at the end and seems much too formulaic for a film that is anything but conventional. It's difficult to identify a true standout because every actor (Bale, Cooper, Adams, Renner, Lawrence, et al) is sensational across the board.

The storyline is a bit of a stretch, but made worthwhile by strong acting from Washington, compelling as usual, and NBA star Allen, surprisingly credible in his screen debut, but there are some issues: film goes on too long by including unnecessary subplots that detract from the central story, and some genuinely poignant moments are undermined by a booming score that tends to overshadow the performances.

Finale is a bit unsatisfying, like you'd expect since this is only the first half of the final chapter, but there's still plenty left to reward fans of the series as they're reunited with a lot of their favorite characters, and thrilled by lots of exciting action scenes, fatal escapes, and jaw-dropping effects sequences. For non-fans the film is likely too long, with too many characters, and confusing exposition, yet it's still enjoyable and only creates more anticipation for the final chapter. ***",Null,0,1,25 November 2010
American Psycho," a nasty piece of work made tolerable by a committed actor
","In the late 1980s, twenty-seven-year-old Patrick Bateman-a shallow, narcissistic, and affluent businessman who works in mergers and acquisitions on Wall Street-lives the indulgent high life, and feels the need to fit in...but he also has a dark secret: he's an impulsive, psychopathic murderer who despite having all the characteristics of a human being, finds it increasingly difficult to control his nightly bloodlust. To watch this film is like seeing a natural disaster unfold right before your eyes; part psychological horror film, part dark comedy, part satirical thriller and character study with a vicious barrage of overkill, this surreal, uneven blend is not for the faint of heart, yet it's well-cast and very interesting, spotlights some memorable 80s tunes, and is carried a long way by Bale's devastating, undaunted performance.

","Third installment to the Terminator franchise takes place when John Connor is in his early twenties and preparing for the rise of the machine empire. An obsolete cyborg model is sent from the future to protect Connor and a veterinarian from a newer, far more advanced, and much more lethal model during an impending nuclear war. The formula that worked so effectively in the 1984 classic wears thin here, but it provides enough explosive action scenes and cheesy one-liners to be entertaining if you buy into it, otherwise it's pretty forgettable.

The lead cop on the case: embittered accident survivor Smith, who doesn't like nor trust robots. Now he must try to halt what he believes to be a robot revolution, that is if he can convince his superiors that he's not paranoid.

When circumstances change dramatically Miles is forced to grow up as the responsibility of carrying on the superhero mantle falls on his shoulders, but not without some unexpected help. Striking animation, large-scale action scenes, brilliant vocal work, subversive and ingenious gags, and a hip, energetic soundtrack are the driving force of this highly enjoyable film, but it also features plenty of heart, heroism, and an important message about family and responsibility. An exciting and frequently funny little ride that's pleasing even if you're not a dedicated comic book fan. ***",Null,1,3,24 February 2019

","An in-depth, shocking, clever and funny look at a dysfunctional suburban family. Spacey is terrific as the disillusioned patriarch who finally decides to try and quell his mid-life crisis; Bening is equally impressive as his frustrated wife who's abandoned everything in favor of her job; Birch is right on target and a standout as their insecure, alienated teenage daughter who forms a bond with her odd next door neighbor. At times unsettling, at times unusual, at times downright hilarious, but always on target with believable characters and situations, first-rate direction, and a sharp, original script. A praiseworthy film indeed. ***½",Null,0,0,12 February 2002

Little does he know that his long lost father was one of the world's deadliest assassins, that is until his latest assignment cost him his life. Wesley is recruited by a mysterious fraternity to become his father's successor, but in order to do so he's going to have to endure hell.

Their only chance for survival is to enlist the aid of an obsolete model (Schwarzenegger) that's been sent back as well to make a stand and protect them. Highly entertaining sequel has some truly remarkable, eye-popping special effects, accompanied by swift, pulse-pounding action scenes, but it fails to capture the creepy atmosphere of the first film.

When the Revolutionary War begins, he's reluctant to take part in it but soon circumstances—specifically his eldest son's enlistment—force him to join in the fight for independence. Unavoidably reminiscent of Braveheart the film holds your attention with its vivid set design and intense battle scenes, though it feels more like a one-man quest for vengeance rather than a historical drama.

","Excelsior! Having spent several months in a psychiatric hospital, a recently divorced man suffering from bi-polar disorder is released to live with his overbearing parents in a suburb of West Philadelphia-not exactly an ideal scenario given his unpredictable behavior and attempt to get his act together. While his mother tries to get him back on the right track and his father desires to make up for lost time by bonding through Eagles football, he meets and forms an uneasy friendship with an unorthodox young woman (recently widowed) who's just as messed up as he is. Like you'd expect the film has a foregone conclusion, but focusing on two lead characters who are totally screwed up creates more entertainment by sidestepping the typical elements of the genre. Moody, poignant, and unconventional, with colorful dialogue and important themes like family and friendship are all displayed by Russell's skillful direction that effectively captures the shifting moods of his mercurial characters. Cooper is appropriately brooding and neurotic, Lawrence perfectly feisty and acerbic, but the acting is superb all-around. ***",Null,1,1,12 December 2018

Along the way Van Helsing must also contend with the likes of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, ferocious werewolves, and Frankenstein's monster. An old-fashioned adventure is created on a lavish scale with exquisite set design and terrific special effects.

Although the odds are once again against him, and he's traveling to fight before a very hostile Soviet crowd, Balboa decides that a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. The formula is wearing thin, to say the least, but the training sequences are so adrenaline-pumping, the ring bouts so engaging, and the soundtrack so motivating that actor/writer/director Stallone gets away with murder as he presents a far-fetched, stereotypical script that's anything but credible.

When he and a manipulative co-worker decide to exploit the discovery for all it's worth, it quickly backfires in ways they could never imagine. An unusual but fascinating, cleverly-conceived story driven by subtle but broadly funny humor and effectively off-the-wall performances, especially Malkovich.

The daring plan quickly goes awry when he loses his own identity in the process, and discovers his arch-enemy is cohabiting with his family. Film's enjoyment depends on the viewer: you'll either condemn the story as absurd and far-fetched, or you'll buy into it and go along for this supercharged, over-the-top action extravaganza. Travolta and Cage are both extraordinarily good, and with Woo at the helm you know that you'd better hang on for dear life!

Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," worthwhile but tries to do a bit too much
","Crucial times lie ahead for the IMF as their superiors question whether the agency is in fact an asset or a nuisance, and pressure is applied from bureaucratic CIA operatives who believe the agency should be disbanded and absorbed. This puts veteran IMF agent Ethan Hunt in a precarious position as he attempts a complex assignment to try and eradicate the Syndicate, an elusive international crime consortium whose capabilities allow them to operate sort of like an 'anti-IMF.' With time running short, Hunt recruits the few loyal members of the IMF to try and complete the task, with lots of unexpected surprises along the way. The cast makes the most of the material but there are so many twists, turns, double-crosses, and cover-ups—which are intended to be slick and suspenseful—but instead just end up dragging out the plot and making it a lot more convoluted than it needs to be. Some key action set pieces, stunt work, gadgetry, and visual effects do make it worth the price of admission, but it never has quite the impact that its immediate predecessor does. **½",Null,0,2,1 August 2015

Lots of kinetic, cartoony action sequences, plus laugh-out loud humor to grab your attention, but the film's best quality is the realism and appeal of its characters and situations.

Well-crafted, strongly acted, and extremely political the film certainly holds your interest, but the script is unfocused, the subject matter never truly compelling, and the momentum slows more and more as it goes along.

Flawed but pleasant sequel is a bit protracted, and has a plot that shamelessly rips-off It's a Wonderful Life, but it works thanks to a lovable cast of characters, some effectively touching moments, and plenty of solid laughs along the way.

Their interaction is the basis for this riveting story, as the cab driver is coerced into driving the reprehensible killer from one 'appointment' to the next. Sharply directed with a vivid portrayal of the L.A. streets, the film never lets go as it takes viewers into a world of deception, murder, and the very depths of human nature. Cruise is excellent and delivers one of his most memorable performances to date as the remorseless assassin Vincent, and the film is a good showcase for Foxx who's simply riveting as his unsuspecting accomplice.

The film chronicles multiple, interwoven narratives of those attempting to flee, those doing their best to aid the effort from afar, and those who would rather stand and fight. From the moment it starts it pulls you in with a vivid, breathtaking sense of time and place, and continually offers new, unexpected story turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.

Are all the people he knows somehow in on it? While there are clues at his disposal, trying to decipher them could very well drive him off the deep end. Steadily bleak, unnerving psychological thriller recalls something out of The Twilight Zone, but it's mesmerizingly shot and edited with plenty of twisty, mind-boggling turns in the story that make it fascinating from start to finish.

Reboot/remake of the series that began with Sam Raimi's 2002 original can't avoid some familiarities, and is let down by a long running time and some thinly developed characters, but it's made worthwhile by good casting, nifty special effects, and intense, edge of your seat action scenes.

Once there, he's given the difficult task of trying to persuade an embittered Charles Xavier (McAvoy) and a maniacal Erik Lehnsherr (Fassbender) to work together to avoid future annihilation. Those who may have grown weary of all the excessive characters and subplots in the previous films will be pleasantly surprised as this tense, epic-scale saga provides multiple narratives skillfully woven together, breathless action scenes, superior special effects, an ensemble cast, a witty sense of humor, and elements of tragedy balanced by just as many genuine displays of heroism.

With new and very personal threats emerging, Earth's mightiest heroes suddenly find themselves engaged in conflict with their former comrades-in-arms. Not so much a Captain America solo adventure as it is an Avengers free-for-all, this is a unique and exciting blend of comic book adaptation and political thriller, with compelling themes of friendship, loyalty, and betrayal, not to mention the sheer joy of seeing so many superheroes engaged in a smackdown of epic proportions.

","The latest in the long line of video game adaptations is just as unremarkable as its predecessors. The overly and needlessly convoluted story centers around an elite SWAT team that infiltrates an underground genetic research laboratory on a deadly mission to investigate a biological virus that has contaminated the lab and mutated everyone into flesh-eating zombies. Like most films of this only marginally successful genre there are some exciting moments of action and violence, but the film is poorly directed, lacks tension, and has a frustrating tendency to let its music drown everything out. Had potential, but it's far too incoherent to succeed. **",Null,0,1,18 March 2002
Avengers: Endgame," a labor of love that serves as a fitting conclusion for devoted followers of the MCU
","The highly anticipated culmination of the Infinity Saga comes to a head in this gripping and episodic installment. Following the grave decimation left by the will of Thanos, the last of the Avengers are left to lament over their losses and failure to protect the universe. With their remaining allies, and a few new ones as well, they devise an elaborate, last-ditch scheme vowing to do whatever it takes to restore the world as they once knew it. Well-crafted, often intensely emotional story is much different in style and in tone than its immediate predecessor, and though the pace lags at times when it gets caught up in the necessary plot jabber (which may raise more questions than answers) it unfolds in ways you wouldn't quite expect with slick, clever twists and in-jokes, wonderful lines, moments of true nostalgia and heroism that pay tribute to the many characters that dedicated followers have come to love over the years. Doesn't quite capture that frantic, ongoing sense of urgency that Infinity War did, but it's rewarding nonetheless, with a smashing and unforgettable finale for series fans. ***",Null,1,3,13 May 2019

","Imperfect but visually impressive and entertaining sci-fi saga chronicles several human stories as Earth suddenly falls under siege to invading alien ships bent on the planet's destruction. Pullman is rock solid as a U.S. President trying to find the most rational solution; Smith is energetic and funny as an ambitious Marine officer; Goldblum is wonderful as a brilliant computer whiz who seems to have all the answers. Occasionally brought down by some weak narratives and stupid characters, but there's more than enough high-energy, high-tech action, and spectacular visual effects to make it worthwhile. Wouldn't hold up under close scrutiny, but a fun way to pass the time. ***",Null,0,2,23 April 2002
No Country for Old Men," a masterful showing from the creators of Fargo
","Powerful, unflinching cat and mouse tale centering around three characters in the 1980s: a dry, laconic Texas sheriff (Jones), a poor but resilient welder and Vietnam veteran in the wrong place at the wrong time (Brolin), and a merciless killer so evil that he could almost be The Devil himself (Bardem). Things get set in motion when the poor man stumbles upon some dead bodies, a stash of drugs, and a loot of two million dollars that he decides to try and keep for himself, but unfortunately this makes him the target of the killer who tracks him expertly while leaving a jarringly brutal signature of violence and mayhem everywhere he goes. It's up to the weary local sheriff to try and resolve the crisis before it's too late. Gripping, suspenseful, and deliberately volatile, this startling tale is on the long side, but never lets up for a minute with tense action, arresting characters, and a surprising since of humor despite the dark and graphic nature of the storyline. Jones and Brolin both deliver sturdy, poised performances, but the film belongs to Bardem—in a raw, powerhouse performance—who's simply bone-chilling as the eerie Anton Chigurh. ***½",Null,1,5,29 December 2007

","The journey continues in this enjoyable follow-up as Bilbo Baggins-having 'found his courage'-accompanies Thorin Oakenshield and his loyal band of dwarves as they push forward in their quest to rightfully reclaim their homeland. Along the way they encounter numerous dangers, and also cross paths with a resourceful group of Elves. Meanwhile Gandalf, trying to keep a promise he made to Galadriel, departs the group to investigate an impending danger in the ruins of Dol Guldur. Long, but unlike its immediate predecessor which was often monotonous and drawn-out, this is adventurous in spirit, features some great new characters, terrific visual effects, thrilling action scenes, and plenty of fatal escapes. The finale, though incomplete, is exhilarating, creating a genuine sense of wonder and serving as a perfect setup for the next installment. Is it on par with the director's previous works? Not quite, but it still entertains. ***",Null,0,1,28 April 2019

In order to succeed and overcome the town's heated resentment, the two must put aside their differences and unite to lead their team to victory. Conventional elements in the script are heavily upgraded thanks to remarkable performances from the young cast, and rock solid performances from Patton and Washington.

While out on the open road, Woody (as loyal and intrepid as ever) finds himself separated from the gang on a mission to find Forky. Encountering new faces, and some familiar ones as well, Woody begins for the first time to justifiably question his purpose in life. Despite being the fourth installment in the series, this latest feature is just as engaging as its predecessors, with a well-crafted story that manages to unfold in very surprising ways, along with stellar animation, terrific vocal work, plus the charm and nostalgia of spending time with so many characters that fans have grown to love.

","Engaging 'restart' to the Batman franchise with Bale well-cast and commanding as Bruce Wayne-a disillusioned young man who, as a child witnessed the murder of his parents, and then travelled abroad. Years later, he returns home to find Gotham City decaying from corruption and organized crime. Aided by his loyal butler (Caine, who provides the film's heart and soul), a steadfast attorney and childhood friend (an underwhelming but effective Holmes), and a scrupulously honest cop (the ever intriguing Oldman), he becomes Batman to strike fear into the hearts of criminals and reclaim the city for its citizens. Dark, brooding, and atmospheric, the film captures the spirit of the 1989 original while still managing to explore a new chapter of the Batman saga; slows down occasionally due to the film's sheer length, but the performances are rock solid, the characters deep and riveting, and the story always involving. Bale anchors the film as the new caped crusader, aided immeasurably by seasoned veterans Neeson (in an unexpectedly forceful performance), Freeman (as always a joy to watch), and Wilkinson (providing one of the film's most colorful supporting roles). Murphy gives an eerie performance as a creepy doctor, and Watanabe makes his presence felt as a deadly ninja.

The premise is formulaic, but it's made worthwhile by a perfectly cast Carrey who pulls out all the stops, taking viewers and his first-rate supporting cast along for the ride.

Recalling a specific time in his youth, Bilbo is recruited by wizard Gandalf the Grey to join a group of thirteen dwarves on a dangerous trek to reclaim Lonely Mountain. Given the source material and having Peter Jackson at the helm creates all sorts of potential, but the film is slowly paced and very long, lacks a rousing since of adventure, and fails to duplicate the majestic quality of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

With the help of a crafty swordsman and a gentle giant, Westley battles thieves, bandits, and fearsome monsters in order to try and reclaim the woman he loves.

The performances of the actors are beyond superb and provide the film's emotional stability as we're drawn into each of their minds as they begin to justifiably question the significance of the task at hand.

A fourth yet surprisingly fresh, fast-paced, and fun installment of the MI series is a globe-trotting extravaganza with sophisticated gadgets, inventive, eye-popping stunts, and slick plot twists.

Failed actress and dreamer April yearns to escape their ordinary, stifling existence, while cynical realist Frank hates his job, frets over finances, and has been reduced to a product of his environment. Not exactly the dream scenario for the long-awaited reunion of DiCaprio and Winslet who were so compelling as star-crossed lovers in the epic Titanic, yet this is clearly a testament to their acting ability as they're able to faultlessly portray a relationship that's the polar opposite of what we saw on screen back in 1997.

Things go awry in more ways than one, and the two teams must band together for survival.

While not as remarkable or awe-inspiring as previous Pixar efforts, this enjoyable film still delivers with stellar animation, high-octane action, clever in-jokes, and a meaningful story.

With only a limited amount of time, Ariel must rely on skittish fish Flounder and crabby crab Sebastian if she hopes to make her dream come true. Joyful animated feature with indelible characters, pitch-perfect vocals, and snazzy musical set pieces, plus as an added bonus important themes like parenthood and teen angst that will strike a chord in both kids and adults.

Old grudges will have to be put aside, egos will have to be kept in check, and unlikely alliances will have to be formed as all of the world's heroes (Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Star Lord, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, et al) must band together to take on an adversary unlike any they've ever encountered before. This intense, sprawling, multi-character saga has the requisite amount of witty humor and relentless, edge of your seat action, but pushes far beyond the boundaries of the comic book world and emerges as an ambitious, allegorical, and often heartbreaking spectacle of heroism and sacrifice that will resonate with viewers long after the film is over. Goes on for a long time, but seeing ten years' worth of MCU characters united for a colossal front is more than enough to compensate. Brolin makes Thanos a compelling, multilayered, and somewhat tragic villain who is sure to be remembered for years to come; a solid outing for non-fans, and a sure-fire hit for dedicated followers. ***Â½",Null,1,3,21 May 2018

Understanding each character's drive and motivation within the story is a bit muddled, thus taking away some of the overall dramatic impact, but striking cinematography and intense, fantastically choreographed action scenes help make up for any of the story lulls.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," overall it's well-made, but doesn't quite know when to let up
","An aging (and fading) Hollywood action star is stuck in an emotional rut in the late 1960s, believing that his once prosperous career has officially gone south-a belief he confides to his best friend and longtime stunt double who, like him but for much different reasons, is also struggling to find a place in the rapidly changing Hollywood scene. By chance the washed up star lives next door to acclaimed director Roman Polanski and his bubbly wife Sharon Tate, and believes that becoming acquainted with them will help propel his status. Tarantino's tribute to the golden age of cinema is well-crafted, features many of his frequent collaborators in key roles (including DiCaprio and Pitt who are a dream pairing) and is especially effective at capturing a specific look and feel of a memorable time period, but it goes on way too long, has a finale that's needlessly sensationalized, and a major subplot about the Manson Family that's more distracting than interesting.

Another mind-boggling story efficiently handled by director Fincher, this unsavory combination of murder mystery and intense psychological thriller will keep you guessing throughout, and though the plot twists may not be airtight, they're joyously manipulative and presented in skillful fashion. Affleck is a good anchor for the interminable firestorm that erupts around him, and Pike goes all-out in a tantalizingly twisted performance that will really get under your skin.

Django Unchained," certainly delivers on its promise
","Tarantino is back at it again, taking his talents to another genre and presenting this bold, brutal, and unconventional 'western' set in the Deep South during the late 1850s. Django is a man on a missionâ€”a freed slave who forms an unlikely alliance with a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter as he goes on a daring trek through various slave plantations to try and rescue his wife from the clutches of a cruel, eccentric Francophile. Combination western, buddy movie, and action-thriller, it delivers what you'd expect with searing action scenes, appropriately incendiary dialogue, and larger-than-life characters, all presented in an anything but straightforward manner. Takes much too long to get where it's going, and has a third act that runs on violent overdrive, but like most of the director's previous efforts it's memorable and well-acted. Foxx is well-cast as the titular character, Waltz matches him as the secondary one, and DiCaprio has an especially meaty role as the vile antagonist, but no one shines more than Jackson who creates one of his most memorable characters to date. Odd, outrageous, and unsettling, but wildly good fun. ***",Null,2,6,4 January 2013

They set out on their trip and...well the rest is really left for the viewer to discover. Writer-director Jordan Peele shows master craftsmanship by taking this simple premise and expanding it in many different directions, incorporating elements of racism, comedy, shock and awe, and wisely never taking things too seriously. The climax is a bit formulaic and over-the-top, but the journey is effectively unnerving and features much stronger acting than you would expect for a film of this genre.

Despite his current predicament, he believes he's destined for a greater future and is given the opportunity to obtain it when he releases a magical genie with the power to grant him three wishes. Though watchable, this probably works better for those who haven't actually seen the animated feature; throws out lots of flashy visual effects, a few new songs, and shoehorns in some dance numbers so as not to be an exact replica, but despite all the effort it still lacks the pizazz, sense of joy, and emotional resonance of the original. Smith makes a wise decision to not try and imitate or outdo Robin Williams, instead making the role his own from the get-go, and Scott makes a strong and passionate Jasmine, but the film drastically underserves the characterizations of Jafar and Iago who were so much more distinctive and vile the first time around.

Taking into account that this is based on Jane's memoirs, it makes sense that more emphasis is placed on Hawking's domestic life rather than his accomplishments in the field of science; film's structure deprives it of some expected conflicts, and thus the emotional impact that comes hand in hand with said conflicts, yet it's still riveting thanks to a remarkable, transformative performance from Redmayne (who earned a well-deserved Oscar) capturing the essence of Hawking with tremendous authenticity, and it's also a great showing for Jones as a strong woman who 'does her best' even in the most difficult of times.

Clearly director Emmerich has overplayed his hand in this genre, but no one will complain as long as the special effects are good and he's able to create a fun moviegoing experience; unfortunately this project has that 'been there, done that' feel to it, as an intriguing premise is overrun by one preposterous, over-the-top action scene after another, and any potentially poignant ideas are lost in the film's excruciatingly long running time.

He sells his soul to The Devil in order to forward his own personal ends, but it's not until years later that he realizes the extent of the deal which grants him unearthly powers that he uses to try and stop the maniacal demon Blackheart. The latest addition to the rapidly growing comic book genre has plenty of exciting effects sequences, as well as some first-class stunt work, along with a corny script; an excess of cheesy humor and familiar plotting weakens the story, but it entertains on a no-brainer level if you enjoy that sort of thing. **",Null,0,3,19 February 2007

Unfortunately for Simba, his embittered Uncle Scar has his own plans and will stop at nothing to take the throne. If you're capable of viewing this as a stand-alone feature (which isn't easy) then you can probably find some things to like about it...but--and it's simply unavoidable no matter how hard you try--when comparing it to the 1994 original it lacks the thrill, humor, and sheer emotional punch, despite some impressive visuals and a colorful assortment of vocal talents, including Jones whose reprise provides some much needed authority, along with Rogen and Eichner who seem perfectly cast. Unfortunately the spoken lines don't mesh well with the use of 'live' animals, and the music doesn't resonate as well as it should.

I Am Legend," some genuine chills and excitement early on but falters as it reaches its conclusion
","In the year 2009, Earth's scientists made a major breakthrough when they thought they discovered a cure for cancer. Unfortunately they were wrong and it mutated, morphing the entire population of citizens into horrific zombies just three years later. Dr. Robert Neville is a former military scientist and the last remaining survivor of the outbreak. Alone in New York City and accompanied by his faithful canine, he conducts extensive research to find a possible cure for the disease during the day, but at night he must go into hiding to avoid the threat of being infected. Apocalyptic thriller is unavoidably reminiscent of the eerie 28 Days Later, at times even feels like a horror take on Cast Away, but it builds plenty of suspense, features superior special effects, exciting action scenes, and goes a long way on the strength of Smith who creates genuine pathos as a lone and resourceful survivor. Only letdown: the third act, which leaves one too many questions unanswered and settles for a conventional finale. A decent way to pass the time, though not recommended for anyone who isn't a fan of the lead actor. **½",Null,1,2,22 December 2007
The Bourne Legacy," unnecessary but worth a look
","Now pay close attention: despite what the title says this is not a fourth entry that further chronicles the journey of Jason Bourne; instead this is a stand-alone film that exists in the same 'realm' as the original Bourne series and features some of the same characters and circumstances. This time around the protagonist is Aaron Cross (Renner), a member of a CIA black ops program who becomes a marked man after the program overseer (Norton) decides to eliminate all assets, that is until Cross acquires help from a reluctant scientist (Weisz), thus making them both a target. Not as tense or engaging as you'd like it to be, with a plot that's often too convoluted for its own good, but fairly effective at times thanks to good pacing, inventive action scenes/stunts, and solid work from Renner and Weisz. **½",Null,3,8,12 August 2012
Cars 2," a nice looking film let down by weak writing
","Pixar takes audiences back into the world of cars in this sequel to the 2006 hit. Lightning McQueen, having achieved much fame and success for his multiple Piston Cup awards, returns home to Radiator Springs to take a break and bond with his best friend Mater. Having been goaded by the supercilious Francesco Bernoulli, McQueen decides to enter the World Grand Prix and takes pal Mater along with him, but things quickly go askew when a case of mistaken identity plunges Mater deep into an espionage plot. Fantastic animation (especially key locations throughout Europe), and a stellar cast of voices can't overcome the clichéd themes and convoluted plot which even adults may have trouble trying to comprehend.

They go into business for themselves by tracking and exterminating supernatural spirits all over New York City, and unexpectedly turn into an overnight sensation. As with most lucrative business endeavors, they're forced to deal with lawsuits, scheduling conflicts, public criticism, and worst of all the forthcoming of a dreadful and potent evil. Refreshingly original, high-tech, snappy sci-fi comedy with imaginative visual effects, likable characters, and hoards of unconventional, screwball laughs.

","When the beloved King Harold falls gravely ill, lovable ogre and son-in-law Shrek is chosen as rightful heir to the throne. Not wanting to accept the responsibility of royalty, Shrek journeys to find Arthur, a hapless young knight who's the only suitable candidate to take on the role. Meanwhile, the pompous Prince Charming rallies a group of vindictive outcasts to try and conquer Far Away Land and get what he views as his fitfully 'happy ending.' Third entry in the witty animated series is likable and pleasant but never transcends its seen-it-all before aura; there are some laughs here and there, and plenty of zany, iconic characters, but not enough fresh ideas, innovative gags, or new plot twists. Sidekick Donkey's banter is forced and only mildly funny, and companion Puss-in-Boots is sorely underused. The film is redeemed to a surprising avail by the appeal of Shrek, but he can only carry this protracted premise so far; engaging enough for kids, strained and predictable for adults. **",Null,0,2,22 May 2007
The Hurt Locker," a powerful and provocative picture
","War is a drug; that's the central theme of this tense, arresting character study that plunges viewers deep into the adrenaline and chaos of modern warfare. On duty in Iraq and with 38 days remaining in their company rotation, two U.S. Army EOD operatives (Mackie, Geraghty) welcome new team leader Sergeant James (Renner), a hotshot ex-Ranger whose reckless ways only exacerbate the tension of their task as they work together in life or death situations to locate and disarm bombs. Taut, suspenseful, and deeply emotional, this authentic war saga vividly depicts the atmosphere of danger, hostility, and complete unpredictability of war, in addition to the bravery, heroism, and camaraderie of soldiers who balance the weight of the task with the pressure to keep their sanity. Intelligent writing and believable characters are perfectly realized by masterful direction and sturdy performances, headlined by Renner's intense portrayal of a gung-ho maverick addicted to the adrenaline rush of war. ****",Null,0,0,29 January 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," a retread of its origins
","Five winters after On Stranger Tides, some of the same key characters (and a few new ones) return for this latest high seas adventure. Callow sailor Henry Turner is on a personal mission to retrieve the Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact thought by many to be a myth. In the course of his journey he crosses paths—and eventually aligns himself with—wanted pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and ambitious astronomer Carina Smyth. The mission is further complicated when they run afoul of Sparrow's 'frenemy' Captain Barbossa, and learn that a gang of undead sailors are coming their way. Follows essentially the same formula as The Curse of the Black Pearl, but the characters lack charisma (even Depp seems curiously subdued), the story is never really engaging, and all the rip-roaring action scenes and special effects can only carry this uninspired journey so far. Bardem effectively sneers and snarls as Captain Salazar, but he's one of the few highlights in an otherwise forgettable entry. **",Null,13,22,27 May 2017

In the midst of the Cold War, a newly appointed, tough-minded Russian submarine captain and his reluctant, recently demoted executive officer must put aside their differences and try to complete the task at hand when their new, state-of-the-art submarine unexpectedly malfunctions during its maiden voyage. Ambitious story is strongly acted and holds your interest, though it never quite peaks in suspense or excitement the way you'd like it to.

Naturally, this attracts the attention of Xavier, Magneto, Mystique et al who are caught in the path of his destruction. Lugubrious addition to the X-Men saga initially seems ambitious and exciting, but stumbles over its excessive narratives, provides little in terms of character, and fails to overcome a feeling of redundancy.

","Crammed and cluttered sequel finds Peter Parker continuing to fight crime as Spider-Man, while also maintaining-or not-a relationship with Gwen Stacy, but then trouble begins: Parker is deeply conflicted about his feelings for Gwen; old childhood friend Harry Osborn returns and takes over his recently deceased father Norman's company which is bad news for everyone in N.Y.C.; born loser and disgruntled Oscorp employee Max Dillon has an accident that makes him a supervillain with a wicked agenda that doesn't make much sense, and that doesn't even sum up half of all the subplots going on in this superfluous comic book adaptation. Sloppy and meandering script could potentially be redeemed by a cast of this caliber, but there's too many characters, an infuriatingly unfocused narrative, and the director's attempt to stage big, grand action sequences is mediocre at best. Shows signs of life as it nears its conclusion, but up until then it goes in so many different directions that it's difficult to take any true enjoyment from it. Overlong, overwritten, and overdone, making this one of the more forgettable Marvel products. **",Null,14,29,1 May 2014

","Intriguing story set in late 19th century Vienna centering around four key characters: an awe-inspiring magician, a covetous prince, a befuddled police inspector, and an alluring duchess. Eisenheim is a magician of much acclaim, but Crown Prince Leopold sets out to expose him as a charlatan, especially when he learns that his fiancée (the Duchess von Teschen) is quite taken with the magician. This puts Chief Inspector Uhl in a bind as he's loyal to the empire, but can't help but to be equally fascinated by the works of Eisenheim. A unique blend of magic, romance, and mystery, this begins very strongly, with some terrific scenery and the expected visual effects, it's also well-cast with an especially strong outing from Giamatti as the conflicted policeman, but the story loses its intrigue after a while, and presents an ending that's beyond convenient. **½",Null,0,0,27 March 2020

It's a race against time for the heroic foursome when they learn that not only does his presence on Earth cause a drastic and threatening change in the environment, but that all of the planets he visits unexpectedly die eight days later. Sequel to Fantastic Four is never truly spectacular or awe-inspiring, but the story is interesting, the script much better than the first, and there are plenty of exciting action/effects sequences.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," an intriguing setup but too broad and too long
","From director David Fincher comes this tale of a man born under an unusual set of circumstances. Pitt is Benjamin Button, a man born old who ages backwards and has the difficult task of trying to live a normal life despite his bizarre and inexplicable predicament. Beginning in the early 1920s the story focuses primarily on his relationship with Daisy (Blanchett), and how they attempt to maintain their love despite the tumultuously changing times and their inevitable age difference. Director Fincher (who seems to be taking a page from Robert Zemeckis) creates a world all its own with striking cinematography, breathtaking visual effects, and unforgettable characters, but it goes on too long and doesn't seem to exist for any reason other than playing the gimmick of a man who ages in reverse for all it's worth. Pitt is good, though his performance is drowned out by the scope of complex makeup effects, Blanchett is adequate, meanwhile Henson is fabulous as the devout southern woman who 'adopts' and comes to love Benjamin as her own. Some touching moments, as well as some funny ones, but they'd be more effective with a shorter running time. **½",Null,1,2,15 May 2009

Despite having the prestigious Spielberg name attached, the latest project from director Michael Bay is—like most of his previous efforts—swift and flashy but equally hollow and cheesy; loud and annoyingly overlong it grabs your attention with destructive action scenes and high-octane, high-tech gadgetry that move at a breakneck pace, but who cares? An abundance of eye candy can't hide its lame characters, nearly nonexistent plot, and extraordinarily stupid dialogue that lead up to a noisy, video game-like climax.

Jones and Smith are once again a worthy duo, but the script isn't fresh enough, or inventive enough, or funny enough for this manufactured sequel to really soar. Some occasionally clever ideas, with a few solid laughs here and there, but the film is ultimately left with that dull, seen-it-all-before feeling as the plot is basically recycled from the first film and tries to squeeze as much as it can out of its two great leads. **",Null,2,4,4 July 2002

Only one problem: his strict, traditionalist family despises music. Trying to seize his moment, Miguel suddenly finds himself in the Land of the Dead where he uncovers more than he could have ever imagined about his familial ties. This is so much more than just a simple nod to the Mexican holiday of Dia de Muertos; it's a deep and thoughtful tale about following your dreams and aspirations, love, forgiveness, and the unbreakable bonds of family with extraordinary visuals, lively songs, colorful characters, and excellent vocal work; a moving and exceptionally well-crafted showing that is sure to please studio fans. ***½",Null,1,7,29 November 2017

If director Sam Mendes wanted to pull viewers into the trenches of the first Great War then he succeeded with flying colors: amazing cinematography, stunning visual effects, and masterful direction with the use of long takes make you feel like you're right in the heart of it, and the realism (and sheer horror) of the battle scenes are overwhelming.

A rich and compelling portrait of a man who sought change, with well-defined characters, an enlightening look into old American politics, and leisure, masterful direction from Spielberg allowing viewers to feel like they were there as it happened.

Despite two more than capable leads and a solid supporting cast this courtroom drama is only marginally entertaining; there are some good moments as the film raises interesting questions about the morality of duty and lawful orders in past as well as present warfare, but the film lacks a definitive spark, suffers from dramatic gaps, and has a dishearteningly mediocre finale.

Better directed than the first film, with some eye-popping action scenes/stunts, but some of the dialogue is extremely dumb and the camera work borders on epileptic. Jovovich is in fine form, adding a burst of energy every time she's on screen; Guillory and Fehr (of Mummy fame) have effective roles as hardened police officers, and Epps makes his mark as a wisecracking civilian.

For the most part this film is nothing more than a juvenile exercise in gross-out gags and toilet humor, but the cast is so enthusiastic and so infectiously likable that you almost have to laugh and enjoy this silly little ride.

The time has come for Merida to choose a suitor, but unfortunately for her overbearing mother Merida's only passion in life is archery. In an attempt to decide her own fate the impetuous young princess defies a custom that creates repercussions she could never foresee, and her inherent courage is put to the test as she tries to make amends for her actions.

Setup is familiar, but with impeccable casting, flippant dialogue, superior special effects, a rocking soundtrack, and enthralling action scenes, it pays back in spades. Non-comic aficionados may be completely unfamiliar with the characters and see this as a thinly veiled hybrid of the Avengers, Star Trek, and Star Wars, but the finished product is just so much fun to watch that it really doesn't matter.

This isn't the usual flashy, lightweight, or humorous mutant concoction; it's a gritty and raw saga with thought-provoking themes, in-your-face action, and dark subject matter. In what is reported to be his final time taking the reins, Jackman—playing an aged and much more vulnerable character—is sensational, creating one of his most memorable and distinctive interpretations to date. An impressive showing, one that isn't really made for fans of its predecessors. ***",Null,1,4,8 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," bites off a bit more than it can chew, but still delivers
","With S.H.I.E.L.D. dismantled and ominous threats still looming worldwide, the Avengers are left to their own devices as they try and maintain their status as Earth's mightiest heroes. Seeking a way to preserve global peace after their latest mission to retrieve the Scepter turns out to be especially demanding, team benefactor Tony Stark (now more the mad scientist than the billionaire genius), unveils the 'Ultron project' an artificial intelligence program that promptly evolves into a powerful sentient incapable of distinguishing between saving humanity, or simply eradicating it. Encountering new foes, familiar faces, and unexpected obstacles, time is not on their side as the team attempts to complete their mission. Never quite as epic in scale as it predecessor this often feels more like a transition or prelude to the next phase of the MCU, but it still serves up some sensational action sequences and stunts, memorable fight scenes, excellent visual effects, well-written dialogue, and an incomparable cast. Not particularly deep, as evidenced by its underdeveloped supporting characters and subplots, but it's still a lot of fun and most importantly leaves you wanting more. ***",Null,1,7,3 May 2015
Big Fish," a larger-than-life adventure
","As a young man, Edward Bloom was always a hopeful dreamer who reached for the stars. As an old man, he's become a warm, peerless storyteller to strangers, but to his son William he remains an enigma. Through a series of vividly imaginative flashbacks, William finally comes to know the father he never knew he had. On the surface, Tim Burton's enchanting tale is a visual playground of magic and myth, fantasy and reality, fable and folklore, but at its heart is a thoughtful, endearing bond between father and son. A dazzling and touching story with unforgettable characters, quirky humor, and an overall feel-good tone. Lots of elements effectively combined make this one enjoyable from start to finish. ***",Null,0,0,16 January 2008
The Dark Knight," amazing! a Batman film and so much more
","It's a critical time for Gotham City: behind the strength of Batman less citizens are living in fear, yet the last remnants of the mob still seek to claim the city for themselves. Teamed with prominent cop Lt. Jim Gordon and golden boy D.A. Harvey Dent, Batman meets his match in The Joker—a wily, sadistic anarchist out to send a message to the citizens of Gotham. It's hard to envision director Nolan crafting a better sequel, transcending the simple boundaries of the comic book genre and creating a powerful tale of fate and chance, morality and justice, sacrifice and redemption that's rich in emotion and nuance, large-scale action scenes, ingenious plotting, and strong characterizations. In his final film, the late Heath Ledger (he died tragically following the film's completion) is nothing short of astounding, creating a deranged and remorseless evil genius whose threat to the hero is formidable. The most major criticism is that it goes on too long, with a few climaxes too many, but it's hard to complain while viewing such masterful storytelling. Too dark and edgy for the youngest audiences but still solid entertainment, arguably destined to be a classic. ***½",Null,2,5,21 July 2008

Though hesitant he decides to take the job and they form a genuine friendship, that is until they decide to try and have sex with no emotional attachments-which of course never works. Snappy at first, with great dialogue, solid laughs, and some clever digs at the romantic comedy genre, but a lot of the fun drains away as it becomes more and more conventional as it nears the finale. Made worthwhile by the work of its two leads who have great chemistry and impeccable comic timing. **½",Null,0,0,19 August 2018
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," lacks the joy and imagination of earlier films
","The next chapter of the Harry Potter series begins with the gifted young wizard temporarily banned from Hogwarts for misuse of his power. When he finally does return, he tries to warn his classmates of visions signifying the return of the dark Lord Voldemort, but unfortunately his warnings are refuted by a bureaucratic new teacher who places a ban on all use of magic. Believing that he and his classmates may be in grave danger, Harry unites the Order of the Phoenix to prepare for a definitive battle against the treacherous Voldemort. The fifth installment of the series is enthusiastically performed but surprisingly uninspired; story isn't compelling enough to sustain the film's length, and there isn't much magic or adventure until the finale, but even then it's not very awe-inspiring. Die-hard fans of the series will probably enjoy seeing their favorite characters, but there isn't much to take in beyond that. **",Null,0,2,23 July 2007

Having just graduated from Emory University, he abandons all he knows and sets out on a courageous adventure of self-discovery. His mission: make it to Alaska and live happily amidst the peace and beauty of the wilderness, but along the way he encounters a series of characters who have an indelible affect on his life. Poignant, insightful coming-of-age tale loses some impact in the latter half, but nevertheless it's a thoughtful, emotionally gripping journey with strong acting and sturdy direction from Penn, though the use of chapter headings doesn't always seem necessary. Hirsch—showing some profound acting chops—is extraordinarily moving and believable as a restless young man trying to find himself. ***",Null,2,5,15 January 2008

Despite their differences, they eventually realize that they need each other in order to overcome a dangerous predicament. On the surface it's the first film ever done completely with computer animation, but at its heart is a compelling story of friendship, love, and acceptance.

Hounsou is a noble, hardworking farmer with a loving family that's torn apart after his son is abducted by a force of corrupt rebel militia. His only choice is to form an uneasy alliance with a covetous, crusading ex-mercenary and treasure hunter (DiCaprio) who has the means to find his son in exchange for the location of a rare and priceless diamond. Starts off good, with an intriguing story and rousing since of adventure, but quickly loses momentum, goes on too long, and shifts tone from action-adventure to familiar political propaganda. DiCaprio (once you get past the hokey accent) acquits himself well in an unexpectedly forceful performance, but the film is grounded by Hounsou's riveting, intensely emotional role as a father driven to desperate means. The father-son relationship is by far the most compelling one in the movie, and would have benefited from greater emphasis. **",Null,0,0,11 December 2006

There are more cat puns, idioms, and witticisms than you'll likely care to count, some which hit, some which miss, as well as some sly Zorro in-jokes so as to take full advantage of the vocal talents of Banderas, and familiar characters on hand like Jack and Jill, and one Humpty A. Dumpty. Despite all the characters and colorful lines the plot is pretty flimsy, and the protagonist seems better suited for a supporting role within the company of Shrek and Donkey instead of having his own full-length feature, as even with a fairly short running time it feels padded-out.

Upon discovering that she was unhappy and decided to completely erase the memory of him from her life, he decides to undergo the same procedure, but can he really go on living without the memory of a woman he once loved? If you're looking for a refreshing mixture of genres then this is an ideal choice as it plays with various tangible themes like loneliness, heartache, and heartbreak, all wrapped up in a nonlinear, mind-bending narrative that at times resembles a complex psychological thriller. As unusual as it sounds, and as bizarre as the presentation is, it's still able to create genuine emotional depth, brought to the forefront by a superb cast, with the usually comedic Carrey convincingly pained and sullen, and Winslet who's spontaneity and fervor make her the perfect foil. An intelligent and memorable hybrid of romance, comedy, and science fiction, not a surprise coming from the screenwriter of other oddball gems like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. ***",Null,0,0,12 June 2019

His goal this time around is to eliminate a fierce ancient warrior known as the Scorpion King, thus granting him control over the dreaded Army of Anubis. Opens with a bang as the introductory action set pieces take you on an over-the-top roller coaster ride, but it quickly loses steam as the rest of the film is desperately padded-out with a flimsy plot, cheesy dialogue, forced humor, and loud, redundant action on its way to an obvious finale.

Sweet, insightful sequel is filled with emotional, heartwarming moments, and remarkable visual effects that surpass its predecessor!

Grindhouse," a creative little feature full of flash, shock, and intrigue
","Startling, audaciously violent double feature from cult directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino is an homage to exploitation B-movies and the grindhouse theater. The first segment Planet Terror is a campy, tongue-in-cheek zombie flick from Rodriguez centering around a handful of survivors trying to escape from a virulent biological infection. A visceral, pumped-up, amusingly gross barrage of trashy overkill done with joyous skill and craft. Tarantino's segment Death Proof is an edgy, talky story about a sadistic stuntman who butchers young women with his car. Takes time getting started, but eventually unfolds into a dark, volatile, hilariously off-the-wall chase flick with an energetic, high-octane climax that will have you on the edge of your seat. Watching this unconventional, episodic, over-the-top little feature you have to applaud the effort of the directors who seem like two rambunctious kids in a candy store.

","Out with the old...in with the new...make way for the young...in the late 1920s silent film era this is slowly becoming the philosophy in Hollywood, much to the chagrin of narcissistic silent film star George Valentin, who refuses to accept the changing times and discourages the 'talkies' emergence in cinema, but a chance encounter with a fetching young woman completely alters the course of his personal life and once thriving movie career. Without the use of audible dialogue the actors are forced to convey their performances through subtle gestures, facial expressions, and body language, a feat which they accomplish with flying colors; this can be viewed as both a crowd-pleasing tribute to the magic of a defunct era in filmmaking, as well as a study of two immensely talented individuals and how they deal with the differing trajectories of their respective careers.

Enjoyable romantic comedy has a penchant for outrageously silly gross-out gags, but they are in fact very funny and cleverly avoid turning mean-spirited.

Long, but faultlessly performed and richly detailed with compelling battle scenes and vivid, breathtaking scenery.

","Young wizard Harry Potter is deeply troubled by a recurring dream in which something terrifying occurs. Once re-enrolled at Hogwarts, he's selected for inexplicable reasons to be a representative in the annual Triwizard Tournament, an intense competition in which the best wizards prove themselves by completing a series of rigorous challenges. To make matters worse, the evil Lord Voldemort returns to try and claim revenge against the heroic young wizard. Imperfect but very entertaining entry loses some momentum in the middle as it gets sidetracked by a distracting subplot, but other than that it's a visual smörgåsbord of magic and craftsmanship, and has an exciting, edge of your seat climax. Never quite as rousing or awe-inspiring as the Prisoner of Azkaban, but a fun-filled adventure just the same, with enough joy for young children, and enough edge and sophistication for adults. ***",Null,0,1,9 April 2007
Thor," an imperfect but effective origin tale
","In the distant realm of Asgard, a group of warriors wage war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim—a tyrannical group determined to conquer all of the Nine Realms. Meanwhile, the most powerful of Asgard's warriors—Thor—prepares to ascend to the throne of his father Odin. When Thor refuses to be diplomatic, and his arrogant nature rears its ugly head, he's stripped of his power and banished to the realm of Earth. Once there, he inadvertently befriends a group of scientists and sets out to reclaim what was once his. Norse mythology set against the backdrop of the Marvel Cinematic Universe delivers with awesome, otherworldly special effects, epic battle scenes, intense hand-to-hand combat, a compelling story, and a surprising sense of humor. Some key subplots never quite resonate the way they should, but once it gets going you probably won't mind. Relative newcomer Hemsworth is a forceful presence in the titular role, and has great help from veterans Portman and especially Hopkins. ***",Null,0,2,7 May 2011
The Happening," unclear what's happening in this movie
","Elliot Moore is an innovative Philadelphia science teacher whose marriage is on the rocks. That's the least of his worries however when a mysterious endemic strikes the northeast region of the United States, causing erratic behavior, violence, and even death among the general population. Along with a group of survivors, it's a race against time to try and make it to safety before their fates are quickly sealed. M. Night Shyamalan's latest showing is interesting, startling, unusual, but also frustratingly uneven; from one point of view it's a supernatural tale of human survival, from another it's a domestic exploration of love and reconciliation, and from yet another it's a deliberately distant, ambiguous story thread designed to pull viewers along before they realize there's really no point. A miscast Wahlberg tries gallantly to pull it off with a straight face, while some of his co-stars seem to be reading off of cue cards. At times serious, at times unintentionally silly (?) it plays mostly as a mixed bag. 'Different' would probably be the most accurate description. **",Null,2,6,14 June 2008
The Shape of Water," clearly a labor of love from a unique director
","Set in Baltimore, Maryland at the height of the Cold War, this unusual romance focuses on a lonely, mute custodian (a warm, wide-eyed Hawkins) who works at a high-security government laboratory. There, she runs afoul of a detestable military project leader (a vicious Shannon), but also forms a special bond with a captive amphibian creature. At times resembling the old silent pictures, this is an ambitious showing from director Guillermo Del Toro who creates a rich fantasy world imbued with vivid scenery, captivating characters, and deep emotional resonance. The set design is impeccable, the acting is first-rate, and the story unfolds in ways you wouldn't quite expect. Reminiscent of Beauty and the Beast this is unconventional, even a bit awkward at times, but thoughtful and touching in its own distinct way. ***",Null,2,6,1 December 2018

Doesn't have as many ideas or the fresh imagination of the first film, but it has some spectacular action sequences that provide a rush of adrenaline, and eye-popping visual effects guaranteed to leave you breathless.

The Disaster Artist," an impressive showing from actor/director James Franco
","In the late 1990s, Greg Sestero is an aspiring young actor in San Francisco looking to fulfill his dream. While taking an acting class at Shelton Studios, he happens to cross paths with the enigmatic Tommy Wiseau, an over-the-top, independently wealthy actor with whom he forms an unorthodox friendship. Within mere months, Tommy convinces Greg to move to Los Angeles to fulfill their dreams, but with both of them struggling to make it into the spotlight, Tommy decides to produce The Room, an autobiographical film that will eventually receive wide regard as one of the worst films ever made. How much of it is actual fact versus fiction is difficult to discern, but this is still a riveting story with intriguing characters, colorful acting, and a good balance of compelling human drama and laugh-out loud humor. A strong outing from director James Franco who truly captures the essence of Wiseau, and a good showcase for younger brother Dave as his long-suffering best friend. A solid supporting cast is just another highlight. ***",Null,0,1,24 September 2018

One, now a cop, races to try and solve the murder while the other, still bearing deep emotional scars, gradually becomes a suspect. Gripping, poignant drama with shades of American tragedy, leisure and detailed pacing from director Eastwood that allows his actors to shine. Penn-as a grieving and vengeful father-is at the top of his game, while Robbins-as a long-suffering victim-matches him in a more brooding, nuanced portrayal. Both won Academy Awards for their exceptional performances, but they're surrounded by an outstanding cast.

On a top secret assignment to decipher Soviet code during the 1950s, he finds himself caught up in a complex government conspiracy plot. Aided by his long-suffering but deeply devoted wife, he goes on a journey of self-discovery to conquer his demons and once again become the man she's always loved. Director Ron Howard's biopic of the bizarre, socially inept mathematician pulls you in emotionally and never lets go, creating a surreal, startling world of science and imagination, with unforgettable characters and jaw-dropping makeup effects. Connelly, in an Oscar-winning role, is sincere and believable as a strong-willed woman who refuses to leave her husband's side, while Crowe is simply shattering as the antisocial Nash. An unforgettable portrait of a man and his life. ***Â½",Null,3,8,11 February 2008

He learns of an eminent threat revolving around an ancient chamber of secrets that could potentially close down the school, but his fellow classmates become suspicious of him when they learn that he's a parsel-tongue and may in fact be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin. Like its predecessor it goes on too long, but the story is much more interesting, and there are an abundance of exciting, inventive, eye-popping special effects.

Matters get even more complicated when they're both assigned to the same target, then forced by their competing agencies to hunt each other down. An ideal summer movie experience; from the moment it starts it's a pure adrenaline rush of energetic action scenes and hip dialogue, but the film's strongest asset is its clever since of humor. Pitt and Jolie are a sizzling duo, perform effective fight scenes/stunts, and spout diverting wisecracks that give the film a pleasant and playful feel throughout. It also manages to display some merits of a healthy marriage despite its silly, tongue-in-cheek content. An impressive showing from the director of The Bourne Identity, and sure to please fans just looking for a good time. ***",Null,0,4,13 June 2005
The Departed," gripping story with a superb cast
","Simply riveting crime saga set in a middle-class Boston neighborhood run by a wily Irish-American gangster who uses his reputation, authority, and invaluable connections to stay a step ahead of the police as he carries out his reprehensible schemes. The story focuses on two cops who are closely acquainted with him, one a mole on the inside torn between his lifelong allegiance to the man who put him there and his swiftly rising duty as an officer, the other a young undercover who becomes the newest member of his fearsome crew and has his life thrown into disarray. An absorbing, cat and mouse tale of loyalty and betrayal, duty and devotion, crime and punishment, with terrific performances, crisp dialogue, and sure-handed direction, though the finale feels padded-out. Nicholson—in yet another patented role—is as good as it gets, but he's aided immeasurably by young co-stars Damon, Wahlberg, and DiCaprio who are all extraordinary. Profane and violent, but convincing and funny as well. ***½",Null,1,2,7 March 2007

","Violent, pumped-up action movie sets a gold standard for the genre for years to come. Willis stars as an NYPD officer visiting his estranged wife who works at an L.A. skyscraper when it just happens to fall under siege to a gang of ruthless international terrorists. Barely armed and alone in his efforts, he becomes the only hope to thwart the cunning and ruthless terrorist leader (Rickman). Starts off slowly, but once it gets going it never stops with eye-popping, in-your-face action set pieces/stunts, laugh-out loud humor, and a deadly cat-and-mouse game between two strong leads. An exhilarating action extravaganza, and a must for action fans. ***",Null,1,1,14 February 2002

It's going to be difficult to maintain a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend, but that becomes the least of his worries when his old ally Optimus Prime tracks him down and warns him of an impending threat that could spell doom for planet Earth without his involvement. Sam must then embark on a daring adventure and discover the secret of the Transformers origins if he hopes to combat the evil Decepticons. As expected—and much like its predecessor—doesn't provide much in terms of story and mostly coasts by on explosive action, superior special effects...and noise.

It's not until years later that they reunite, form a genuine friendship, then struggle to keep things platonic despite their obvious affinity for one another.

","The Cruise-Spielberg team that brought audiences Minority Report return for this big budget sci-fi saga about a working-class father and his two estranged children who must band together and fight for their survival after Earth is invaded and overrun by tripod war machines on a mission to exterminate the human race. With shades of Independence Day the film is well-crafted, suspenseful, and at times exciting, but the script leaves too many questions unanswered and never really delivers the way you'd hope for. Starts with a bang and works well as a thrill ride likely to please action fans, but those looking for a fresh, inventive sci-fi feature probably won't be impressed.

12 Years a Slave," good to the point of unbearable
","Excruciating and gut-wrenching drama based on the memoirs of Solomon Northup, a free-born New Yorker, musician, and family man, until he's kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Antebellum South. Director McQueen and screenwriter Ridley make no attempt to whitewash the graphic and unsettling subject matter, creating a vivid and compelling portrait of violence, brutality, and human cruelty, but at the same time glimmers of hope, strength, and inspiration, made all the more powerful by the film's autobiographical source material. A stunning and unflinching recreation of one of the most horrific periods in American history, tough to stomach at times, but so well-crafted, well-made, and convincingly acted that its impact can't be denied. Ejiofor perfectly embodies the gamut of confusion, fear, and determination of the beleaguered protagonist, Fassbender is disturbingly good as the vile, vicious monster of a plantation owner, while Nyong'o is simply heartbreaking as a demoralized slave girl.

The plan almost never fails, until they decide to try and pull off the crash of a lifetime and one of them ends up developing genuine feelings for his prospective target. Entertaining comedy turns conventional in its third act, but it's enthusiastically performed by two likable leads, and has a lot of memorable comedic moments.

There Will Be Blood," a dark, gripping, and multilayered showing
","Greed and corruption; family and fortune; faith and religion; spiritualists and swindlers; an embittered, self-serving, charismatically twisted individual eroded by his own selfish desires; these elements and more are the basis of this spellbinding film set at the turn of the 20th century oil industry, centering around an independent prospector (Day-Lewis) driven by his rapacious desire for large profit and uncompromising contempt for the human race. He's earned credibility as a chief manufacturer of oil, but to expand his empire and become enormously wealthy he follows an anonymous tip that leads him to a small California town. Once there, he matches wits with an influential young pastor (Dano) with an equally ambitious agenda. Paul Thomas Anderson's brooding, ominous tale takes its time to unfold, but emerges as a masterwork of superior storytelling with startling scenes, a haunting score, and strong acting, headlined by an astonishing Day-Lewis as miserly misanthrope Daniel Plainview. ***½",Null,0,4,22 January 2008

","In the early 1980s Gotham City has deteriorated into an incendiary cesspool of crime and apathy where the rich and powerful have cast aside lower-class residents like Arthur Fleck, a party clown who's been disregarded his entire life. In spite of this he aspires to make it as a stand-up comedian, but his troubled history and mental erosion have begun to strip away what remains of his sanity. If you're looking to bring a well-known comic book character to the big screen in a way that's never been done before then look no further: this relentlessly dark and morbid story from Todd Phillips (yes, the same one from The Hangover series) is a psychologically twisted and unnerving character study of a frightening individual's downward spiral and just how far he'll go to make a name for himself. Intense, riveting, allegorical but equally audacious, chaotic and off-putting with a sluggish first half, how much actual enjoyment is derived from watching it is in the eye of the beholder, but there's no denying the work of Phoenix (with shades of Christian Bale) who dominates the screen with his unflinching portrait of the damaged protagonist...not for the faint of heart. **Â½",Null,1,1,13 October 2019

After she's kidnapped by the mysterious leader of an underground crime syndicate, Creasy goes on a deadly rampage to seek retribution against those responsible. Well-crafted with a first-rate cast the film holds your interest, but the subject matter turns ugly, the direction borders on pretentious, and the story loses credibility as it nears the finale.

Unwilling to accept defeat, the Bellas seek out their only shot at redemption: enter and try to win the world a cappella championship. Despite a slew of returning characters, this is fairly monotonous up until the finale; tries to make up for a lack of lively musical numbers or interesting plot twists with an excess of crass humor and politically incorrect jokes, but that can only carry this so far. Steinfeld is appealing as a 'legacy' student who joins the group, and Key provides a few chuckles as an abrasive music producer, but beyond that there isn't much new ground to cover. **",Null,0,0,19 February 2019

Intense, exhilarating drama from director Damien Chazelle pulls you in right from the start and never lets up with vigorous acting and top-grade musical numbers on its way to a smashing climax. Teller is compelling as the youthful student pushed to his very limits, while Simmons (who looks like he'd be right at home in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket) gives a brutal, uncompromising performance as his relentless 'mentor.'

His success comes at a price though, and he quickly gets plunged into a reckless lifestyle where the money rolls in and the party never stops, even when the federal government gets wind of his underhanded dealings. To say that this is not for all tastes would be a drastic understatement; overlong, unapologetically profane, and unabashedly sleazy, this never attempts to sugarcoat the behind-the-scenes world of Belfort's lavish, hedonistic lifestyle, but despite how off-putting it is at times, it's never dull, with crafty direction from Scorsese (very similar to his work in Goodfellas), enough twists and turns in the story to keep things from becoming redundant, along with a great cast and knockout performances from DiCaprio, Hill, and Robbie.

Naturally everyone is a suspect except her, as she once again seems to be the primary target of the killer's deadly game.

Along the way, the bold officer acquires a reluctant partner in the form of a hostile civilian shopkeeper (Jackson). You'd think the series is wearing thin by now but it's not, and the result is a non-stop roller coaster ride of action and suspense, as the two leads run wild all over the city trying to stay one step ahead of their deadly antagonist.

Unfortunately for him, the plane is populated with some of the world's most heinous criminals—led by devious mastermind Malkovich—who take over the plane and make plans of their own. The cast is first-rate, and with Bruckheimer at the helm you know that the action scenes are sure to provide lots of fun, but they're thrown into the mix with a corny script that's ridden with silly characters and stupid wisecracks.

Not so much a sequel as it is a continuation of the source material, this time around Muschietti-clearly working with a larger budget-holds nothing back piling on the visual flourishes and gross-out effects (a bit too much at times) but makes a good decision to give his efficiently chosen adult cast a broad platform on which to explore their characters, and cleverly interweaves the narrative with pivotal flashbacks that allow viewers to revisit the young counterparts who set it all in motion. Devotees of the novel may be discouraged by some of the significant changes, and while it is difficult to maintain a consistent level of fear and suspense with the lengthy running time, it's still gripping and colorful, with some truly eerie moments, great dialogue, and a wonderful sense of humor, thanks largely to the work of Ransone and especially Hader, whose witty banter is a definite highpoint.

As an adult, he has yet to fully come to terms with the affair and how it drastically affected the trajectory of his life.

Years later—as an adult—he decides to embrace his destiny and take his proper place in the Circle of Life. Warm, intelligent, laugh-out loud funny film is a triumph in every aspect; unforgettable songs, snappy dialogue, remarkable animation, and a stellar cast of voices make this a treat for all ages. A rousing adventure that you can enjoy again and again, and arguably one of the finest animated films ever made. ****",Null,89,107,14 March 2002

","Dunst is immensely likable as a dedicated high school cheerleader who's appointed new captain during her senior year. She's excited about the possibilities, and is determined to keep her squad on top after years of success. Unfortunately winning the state championship senior year is going to be much more difficult than in previous years as they find a potent rival in the form of a black, talented inner city squad. On paper it may sound silly, but the film is well-cast, energetic, and very funny with hip, witty dialogue and keen observations that keep it from becoming predictable or taking itself too seriously. Dunst shines in the lead, and has great help from feisty Dushku. ***",Null,0,0,15 May 2002
Inception," a wildly effective mind game
","Exciting, intricate, cerebral thriller from the one and only Christopher Nolan. DiCaprio-a thief with heavy emotional baggage-is a professional 'dream extractor' who obtains inaccessible information from others by penetrating their subconscious mind. With the aid of a motley, high-precision team, he's recruited by powerful businessman Watanabe for his most difficult assignment yet and a definitive shot at redemption...and the hits just keep on coming. Only director Nolan (who captivated audiences with the labyrinthine thriller Memento) could pull this one off, delivering a gripping, perplexing, pulse-pounding, and multilayered story that's rich with emotion and nuance, endlessly inventive ideas, intriguing plot twists, believable characters, and more than enough high-energy action/effects sequences. Film's mind-boggling logic can be confusing-to say the least-even questionable at times, but the script always manages to deliver a new, effective twist to keep you on the edge of your seat. A rich, dazzling, dizzying, and challenging film that requires a careful attention span, and likely repeated viewings. ***½",Null,1,6,22 July 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," a heavyweight cast that's given little to work with
","A hollow, high-profile treatment of the Agatha Christie whodunit set in the mid-1930s about Hercule Poirot, a Belgian incarnation of Sherlock Holmes who may or may not be the world's greatest detective, and his attempts to solve a murder case while onboard the Orient Express. Lead actor and director Branagh seems to be overdoing it a bit, recruiting a star-studded cast who are unfortunately used to just show up and be recognized, rather than actually employ their acting abilities. Despite good scenery, a vivid sense of time and place, and the multitude of colorful characters, there's little in the way of suspense or intrigue, two elements sorely needed for a film like this to really succeed. Watchable, but fails to provide a truly satisfying payoff. **",Null,1,1,11 March 2018

However, that's only the beginning as he turns out to be a much more formidable foe than they originally anticipated. As the case escalates, the duo test the limits of their partnership, especially when a temptress and old flame suspiciously re-enters Holmes' life. Elaborate and entertaining, with Downey in perfect form as Holmes, Law a good sidekick as Watson, McAdams a strong and sexy heroine as Irene Adler, but it goes on too long and suffers from a convoluted plot. **½",Null,0,2,2 January 2010

One day he finally releases his anger, and discovers that he has a knack for aggressive tackling. With the help of a dispirited coach, he unexpectedly turns into a fearsome linebacker and college football star. The premise sounds incredibly silly on paper—and in fact it is—but if you don't think about it too much there are an abundance of clever, funny gags, a likable cast, and some effectively amusing cameos. Sandler is lots of fun, and the film is a great showcase for Bates as his needy mother. ***",Null,3,5,26 April 2002

","In the distant future, planet Earth has been reduced to an uninhabitable cesspool of garbage and humans have been forced to adapt to life in outer space. All that remains is WALL-E, a lonely but durable and industrious robot who's only companion is a cockroach. One seemingly uneventful day, WALL-E encounters a highly advanced robot named EVE whose mission is to locate any remaining plant life, and together they go on the adventure of a lifetime to try and return the human population to their proper home. The latest concoction from the one and only Pixar Studios has some spectacular animation, a lovable lead character, and plenty of chuckles throughout, but the unintelligible dialogue keeps it distant, and the pace lags heavily early on. Story is too complex for younger audiences, the gags—surprisingly—aren't sophisticated enough for adults, but it's made watchable by a very appealing WALL-E.

This time around the focus of the story is Dory, the amnesiac blue tang fish who has a sudden yearning for her missing family. With clownfish pals Marlin and Nemo in tow, she sets out blindly yet determined to reunite with the parents she once knew. Visual effects are impressive, clever gags are plentiful, and there are an assortment of new characters—including a slick, scheming octopus voiced to perfection by O'Neill—but there are some story lulls here and there, and it doesn't quite rise to the level of awe or heartwarming emotion as its predecessor.

What do they want? Are their intentions hostile or friendly? Paired with a reticent physicist at an encampment in Montana, these are some of the many questions she's tasked with trying to determine while tensions mount throughout the rest of the world. Riveting and intelligent sci-fi drama has a premise that sounds all-too-familiar, but it's meticulously detailed, convincingly acted, and masterfully edited, with just the right mix of gloom and uncertainty to keep you guessing.

He has little formal education, and lacks the aggression he needs to play football effectively, but his luck changes after he's taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Bullock), a gracious white woman who adopts him as a member of her family and teaches him how to hone his skills. A bit pat, to say the least, and doesn't provide quite the emotional payoff it needs to really make it soar, but the acting is rock solid and the fact that it's based on a true story makes it feel all the more genuine. The latest in a long line of films you can really get behind, and a good showcase for lead actress Bullock as well. ***",Null,0,1,10 August 2010

When the son lands a gig tutoring the child of a well-to-do family, the father seizes the opportunity to escape their squalid existence...to reveal any more would be a travesty. Takes its time getting started, but once it does hang on! Spellbinding mixture of social commentary, greed, horror, dark comedy, familial bonds, and a totally unpredictable narrative with creative, clever story twists that you can't possibly see coming, this inspires a multitude of emotions like anger, sadness, pity, humorous shock and awe, and just refuses to let up. The ending is padded-out, and definitely stretches the limits of credulity, but the film's overall impact is simply undeniable.

","Riggan Thomson was a famed actor who gained recognition for playing the lead role in a superhero film series.

Determined to stay relevant and be recognized as a serious actor, he takes on the task of writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation, taking his girlfriend, lawyer/best friend, estranged, strung out daughter, and a talented but loose cannon method actor along for the ride. An intense, surreal, and immersive movie experience with terrific dialogue, outstanding visuals, clever, self-referential humor, and a story that's riveting from start to finish. Nearly every actor is phenomenal across the board, and Inarritu's crafty directorial style is astonishingly effective, allowing for several tense, character-to-character interactions that will both shock and amuse.

He also gets an up close and personal look at the dark and depraved duality of man as he interacts with his equally strong, equally opposed sergeants.

A chance encounter with American military pilot Steve Trevor leads her to believe that she can locate the unscrupulous Ares herself, so she leaves her homeland and finds herself in WWI era London still determined to complete her mission. Unlike previous DCEU films, this managers to tell a compelling—and coherent—story with splendid visual effects, a vivid sense of time and place, just the right blend of action, drama, and humor, along with believable (and engaging) characters.

Despite their attempts to settle things amicably, the reality of the situation brings some long simmering emotions to the surface. A thoughtful mediation on marriage is beset by a few awkward moments in the script, but the up and down themes of love, family, parenthood, and all the emotional baggage that come with them are genuine, and it's acted with great conviction.

In order to restore peace to his swamp, Shrek makes a deal to go on an arduous journey to rescue a princess, but his trek is aided/hampered by the presence of a motor-mouthed donkey.

In the early 1960s, they select gifted mutants from all over the world and help them harness their powers in hopes that they can help combat a sinister megalomaniac who's bent on starting World War III. Undermined by needless, underdeveloped supporting characters, and unavoidably predictable story elements, but made worthwhile by efficient action scenes, good special effects, and effective casting in key roles.

Now, having reached an emotional impasse, he travels to Japan to visit an old comrade. Once there, he quickly gets caught up in a complex political power struggle that, for the first time in his life, makes him truly vulnerable. Jackman, not unexpectedly, is formidable in the lead, and there are lots of visceral action scenes, but that does little to compensate for the faults; film's tone is grim, its characters—sans Jackman—are unappealing, plotting is convoluted, subject matter turns ugly, and the pace lags heavily after a strong start. Jackman effectively spits, scowls, snarls, and flexes his muscles in what has become his go-to role, but he has almost no support; too long, too dark, and too serious to really be fun. **",Null,21,44,12 August 2013

With no remaining options, the aggrieved and reclusive Bruce Wayne must once again become Batman to try and save his beloved city from total annihilation, only this time not only is his adversary more fearsome than any other he's ever faced, but he also finds his resolve tested in ways no one-least of all he-could ever foresee. Third and purportedly final entry to Nolan's groundbreaking take on the iconic comic book character takes its time to unfold, but once it does hang on!

Innovative, well-crafted, and culturally significant entry to the Marvel Universe is a feast for the eyes with beautiful, breathtaking scenery, strong, captivating characters, but most importantly it's a very personal and compelling story with political overtones that raise serious, penetrating questions about the modern world.

Pacino is a burned-out coach who's given it his all, Diaz a venal team owner, Quaid an aging quarterback in the twilight of his career, Foxx a youngster on the rise so full of himself that he can't comprehend his fundamental errors. The cast, full of talented actors and recognizable sports stars, does what they can, but the film depends on loud, ugly, in-your-face action on the field which while intense and flashy, quickly becomes an assault on the senses.

A changed man, he decides to pull the plug on weapons marketing and covertly constructs a state-of-the-art iron suit that gives him the capability to combat rebel militia groups who've acquired his technology under the table...unfortunately that's easier said than done.

Director Aronofsky clearly favors extreme close-ups which are effective in creating a palpably tense and claustrophobic atmosphere, before eventually spiraling into an ugly, interminable abyss of madness and despair. Bardem, Harris, and especially Pfeiffer are all convincing, but this is Lawrence's show and she gives the kind of gut-wrenching performance that echoes the very reaction of the audience. Fluctuating between riveting, confusing, and downright appalling, the gamut of emotions on display here are simply exhausting, but buried somewhere beneath all the mishmash and chaos are some poignant allegorical themes...deciphering them is not a task everyone is likely to embrace.

The story isn't particularly compelling-in fact it's more of a retread of various elements seen in previous installments-but it maintains your attention thanks to some intensely moving dramatic scenes, and (not surprisingly) thrills you with its intense, adrenaline-pumping training scenes and ring bouts; an acceptable (if unremarkable) follow-up. **½",Null,0,0,14 February 2019

Majority of the incoherent story consists of a buildup to their inevitable encounter as the Gotham City billionaire and socialite—having seen firsthand the destructive repercussions of the battle of Metropolis—attempts to preemptively combat the man of steel whose otherworldly abilities have made him a controversial figure in the eyes of government officials. Dark, grim comic book adaptation succeeds at bringing the two iconic superheroes to the big screen, but strips away all traces of humor and humanity, can't seem to decide which story it wants to tell, and ends in anticlimactic fashion. Not only that, but the action scenes are presented with such bombastic overkill that they fail to generate any real tension or excitement. Affleck and Cavill carry their weight admirably, but there isn't much in the way of character arc or development, and a woefully miscast Eisenberg certainly can't fill the shoes of Hackman or Spacey as Lex Luthor.

Not a bad idea, but it's going to be a lot harder than they thought after they encounter a group of ruthless, volatile cowboys who draw them back into deadly conflict.

","Bruce Willis reprises his role as maverick cop John McClane in this old-fashioned but entertaining action-thriller. As the story begins McClane is at odds with his daughter, but has little time to make amends when he's recruited by the feds to track down a notorious computer hacker. Unfortunately McClane once again finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when that same hacker becomes the target of a cyber-terrorist ringleader who instigates a systematic scheme to shut down the entire country. Despite a twelve year hiatus and familiar plotting this post-9/11 fourth installment packs plenty of punch with inventive action scenes, first-class stunt work, and more than enough wisecracks. Rough, tough, and action-packed, with Willis in peak form as the 'old school' hero, and Long a good fit as his mild-mannered sidekick. Too long, and silly at times, but the story is interesting and the film serves as just what it should be: lots of fun. ***",Null,3,6,28 June 2007

In the midst of it all, maverick mutant Wolverine begins to slowly piece together his mysterious past. Endless special effects and exciting action sequences make it fun to watch, but the story isn't strong enough to hold up to them and overstuffed with silly humor. Mostly just plays as an exercise in how many different displays of power it can show in the film's running time. **½",Null,0,0,4 May 2003

","Although the reprehensible Loki has been captured and imprisoned for his various crimes, dark times still lie ahead not just for Asgard, but for all of the Nine Realms. Malekith-the ruler of an evil race known as the Dark Elves-has awakened after eons of hibernation and seeks to use a powerful weapon known as the Aether to leave the universe in darkness. Knowing that Malekith and his army will be too much for Asgard to overcome, Thor must reunite with Jane Foster and reluctantly recruit Loki for a perilous mission to try and save all. Made watchable by memorable fight scenes, excellent special effects, and a good sense of humor, but suffers from a standard storyline, as well as some poorly developed supporting characters and subplots. Hemsworth-now appearing as if he could play the role in his sleep-is again a force in the lead, but no one has more fun than Hiddleston who goes for broke as the villainous Loki. Acceptable entertainment, but with underwhelming results. **",Null,0,2,9 November 2013

He's also in the midst of his most difficult case yet in trying to get through to a troubled, introverted young boy (an exceptional Osment) who lives in fear and trauma of his uncanny ability to see the dead. One of the most effective thrillers of its time: gripping, suspenseful, flawlessly performed, and extremely well-crafted, with sure-handed direction that allows for plenty of spooky, spine-chilling moments on its way to a startling and awe-inspiring finale. A genuinely scary thriller that actually pays off the way it should. ***Â½",Null,2,3,7 March 2002

In a race against time, with his deadly adversaries in hot pursuit, he reunites his old team (Freeman, Mirren, Malkovich) in an effort to uncover the conspiracy. A few longueurs and some familiar plotting, but it's hard to miss with this cast, these energetic action scenes, and so many laughs.

Although initially hailed as a hero, a toxicology screening reveals that Whip was under the influence of cocaine and alcohol, and he faces some difficult choices if he's going to avoid culpability for the incident. What initially seems like a taut suspense thriller quickly transitions into a gripping and believable character study of addiction, loss, and redemption.

Along the way, Harry uncovers some shocking secrets and braces himself for what will be the ultimate battle of his young lifetime. About as entertaining a finale as one could hope for, with sure-handed direction, swift pacing, engaging characters, startling revelations at just the right moments, and amazing effects that create a world of magic, wonder, and mysticism.

Intensely riveting at times, as well as expectedly visceral and shocking, with sturdy direction from Spielberg that captures the essence of an infamous time in history, but the tension slowly dissipates as the story unfolds. Bana effectively conveys his character's growing vulnerability and disillusionment with the task at hand, and the always dependable Rush has a juicy role as his no-nonsense handler.

Newly arrived freshman Beca Mitchell, a rebellious and introverted loner whose father is on the teaching staff, likes music but not singing. Going against her better judgment she auditions to join the Bellas, but whether or not she can fit in and conform to their strict and traditional regiment remains to be seen. It's not hard to figure out the trajectory of this film, but it's elevated thanks to likable characters, good casting, laugh-out loud humor, colorful lines, and of course some fantastic musical numbers.

When Truman becomes suspicious of the façade, complications ensue for the cast and crew to try and keep the show running. An odd, but remarkable and fascinating story effectively brought to life by a surprising performance from Carrey—abandoning his comic roots—and a superb supporting cast. Unfocused at times, but always interesting and utterly believable.

To send a message, President Snow announces that the third Quarter Quell of the games will involve tributes selected from previous victors, all but guaranteeing that Katniss and Peeta will once again have to compete, only this time it's an entirely new game where they're pitted against trained killers. Impressive and emotionally gripping follow-up takes little time to get started and delivers with spectacular effects sequences, a clever assortment of new dangers, tense action scenes, and some unforgettable additions to the cast (played to perfection by Hoffman, Clafin, and especially Malone).

Fast forward to the present day where there are similar occurrences in the same region, only this time they find themselves on the trail of a giant super predator. But is this predator a friend or a foe? Starts off strongly, with sturdy direction and an effectively tense and teasing build up, but then in the second half it comes apart; goes on too long with excessive exposition, loud, redundant action scenes, clumsy plotting and editing, and a lack of real tension or character development.

","Flip, foulmouthed, hilariously self-referential comic book adaptation is the long-awaited solo project for infamous Marvel character Wade Wilson, a savvy ex-mercenary making a living as a 'bad guy' taking out 'worse guys' in the big city. Having found some degree of stability in his violence-prone, unpredictable life, he receives some devastating news, until undergoing a rogue experiment that grants him accelerating healing and the potential to be a superhero--that is if he can keep his thirst for vengeance and various other antihero qualities in check. Fans who've grown tired of conventional origin stories will be surprised to find this lacks any of the usual qualities of a traditional comic book tale; amusingly demented, unapologetically profane, with over-the-top violence and sexual underpinnings to boot, this earns its 'R' rating with a big smile on its face. Reynolds' ebulliently vulgar approach perfectly suits the material, and helps overcome any predictable story elements.

Broad comedy ensues as a group of zany ex-players are brought together to try and develop the chemistry needed to succeed.

Meanwhile, the infamous Leslie Chow has escaped from prison and has a long list of enemies, including a particularly ruthless one named Marshall (Goodman) who demands the Wolfpack find Chow or else suffer dire consequences.

Of course the obvious question is: can this unmistakable odd couple co-exist long enough to get the job done? Inspired by a true story this delivers many expected and familiar themes like racism, dignity, and friendship, and while the comparisons with Driving Miss Daisy are simply unavoidable, it features some snazzy musical numbers, a good central theme, and is highlighted by the performances of Mortensen and Ali who play so well off one another. ***",Null,0,2,31 March 2019

Long but absorbing and provocative every step of the way, anchored by Cruise's persuasive performance in the lead; a great achievement. ***½",Null,0,1,12 February 2003
The Wedding Singer," has its flaws, but worth watching
","Entertaining romantic comedy set in the midst of the lively 1980s. Sandler is a small town wedding singer who abandons the notion of love after his fiancÃ©e dumps him at the altar. He finds a friend in waitress Barrymore, but when he discovers that she's about to marry a real jerk he gradually begins to fall in love with her. Not the type of role you'd expect from lead actor Sandler, yet the film is engaging and sweet, with good performances, plenty of laugh-out loud moments, and a dazzling display of wardrobe to give homage to a very memorable era. Humor is needlessly crude at times, but two very appealing leads keep it afloat. ***",Null,1,1,26 April 2002
The Pursuit of Happyness," familiar but well-made and entertaining
","Conventional, but meaningful and well-acted true story of Chris Gardner, a struggling 1980s San Francisco salesman and devoted single father whose goal in life is to make something of himself. One day, a chance encounter with a successful stock broker inspires him to go for it all, and he stays determined despite all the difficult obstacles that life continually throws at him. The plotting is familiar, and the narration doesn't always seem necessary, but Smith gives one of the finest performances of his career as Gardner, accompanied by real life son Jaden, and the story is inspiring. Never quite as compelling as it could be, yet still deep and moving. ***",Null,0,0,13 March 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," familiar formula redeemed by great casting
","An ideal action-comedy/adventure if there ever was one; in this entertaining third installment archaeologist Ford must travel to Italy in 1938 to try and rescue his estranged father. However, the rescue mission soon turns into a historic quest as he seeks out the Holy Grail, once again finds himself battling Hitler's Nazis, and again encounters dangerous perils every step of the way. Follows basically the same formula as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but Connery is an added bonus as Ford's father and the two make a perfect duo. A good blend of elements as the film provides lots of exciting, cliffhanger action scenes/stunts, memorable lines, and genuine humor, but the relationship between the two leads is what really gives it stability. Lots of fun. ***½",Null,33,59,17 April 2002
Goodfellas," one of the best films of the decade
","Absorbing, pumped-up tale—based on real life incidents—beginning in the mid-1950s about an ambitious young man who grows up in the mafia-ridden neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. His parents have high expectations for him, but unfortunately for them his only goal in life is to become a member of the mob. From the moment the film starts it grabs and holds you with its riveting story, dark humor, memorable characters, colorful dialogue, over-the-top performances, and potent violence. Every member of the cast is superb, and Pesci is a real scene stealer. Runs around in the latter half and loses some of its impact, but overall a gripping, authentic, and startling look at life among mobsters. Unforgettable and really a must-see. ****",Null,2,5,4 December 2002
The Bourne Supremacy," imperfect but fun
","Taut, suspenseful follow-up to The Bourne Identity. This time around ex-assassin Jason Bourne has abandoned his former life as a government operative and is living undercover as a civilian, until he's brought out of hiding by a maverick agent (Allen) who suspects he's the mastermind behind the death of a Russian politician. Fast-paced and complex the story is convoluted, almost incomprehensible at times, but it's skillfully made and anchored by a firm, forceful performance from Damon as the amnesiac spy, as well as a solid supporting cast. The only disappointment is the action scenes which while fun to watch, are often frustratingly unfocused and deprive the film of much needed shots of adrenaline. Entertaining, but not recommended for those with little patience. **½",Null,0,1,25 October 2004
Hustle & Flow," won't appeal to everyone, but quite a showing nonetheless
","Terrence Howard is powerfully good in a gritty, layered performance as a cutthroat Memphis street pimp and dealer who's only ever known one life, and is trying his best to squeeze a dollar out of a dime. A chance encounter with an old school friend helps him realize he's at a crossroads, and he takes a one in a million shot to escape his dead-end existence through the world of hip hop. By exploring the harsh realities of the street life this expectedly contains plenty of less than flattering subject matter, but underneath all the dirt and grime is a gripping story of hope and inspiration, with some hype musical numbers and strong acting. Howard's tour de force showing is definitely the highlight, but the film is also a good showcase for Henson as the broken woman who catches his eye. ***",Null,0,0,3 April 2020
Sully," gets right to the heart of the matter
","An earnest, white-haired Hanks is ideally cast as Chesley Sullenberger, an adept pilot of forty plus years who on January 15, 2009 successfully landed a U.S. Airways flight on the Hudson River saving all 155 souls on board. Though initially hailed as a hero, the reticent aviator has little time to process everything he's been through when he finds himself under scrutiny by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). With a surprisingly short running time you almost want the film to go on longer than it does, especially when thinking about the miraculous real-life incident that inspired it, yet it's efficient and well-made. Never a dull moment in this affecting drama, which also serves as an unofficial love letter to New York City. ***",Null,0,0,8 May 2020
Cinderella Man," familiar but moving and triumphant just the same
","The producing-directing team of A Beautiful Mind crafted this true story of an impoverished Irish-American boxer from Jersey. It's the Depression Era, and James J. Braddock is the 'Bulldog of Bergen,' a tenacious but aging boxer who's too heavy, too slow, and too old to keep fighting. He takes an unsteady job as a longshoreman to support his wife and three kids until he's given a rare second chance to compete in the sport he loves, but at what cost? Not only an engaging sports bio, but also a close examination of domestic life and vivid reminder of the harsh reality that people faced while struggling to support themselves during a very bleak time in American history. Crowe looks stellar in the ring, but is equally good outside of it, and he's got admirable support from fiery Giamatti and empathetic Zellweger. It's awash with familiar story elements, but they're presented with raw emotion and depth. ***",Null,0,0,13 May 2020
Jurassic Park," one of the most memorable movie experiences of its time
","Breathtaking, highly imaginative adventure from one of a kind director Steven Spielberg. Based on the novel by Michael Crichton comes this incredible story of a wealthy entrepreneur (Attenborough) whose unprecedented scientific advancements allow him to create an island theme park populated with living dinosaurs. He invites a handful of researchers and his two eager grandchildren to tour the park before it opens to the public, but their peaceful tour soon turns into a deadly fight for survival as the park security system breaks down and the prehistoric creatures run amok all over the island. Tense, suspenseful, edge of your seat thrill ride starts slow but only gets better as it goes along, and dazzles you with some of the most astonishing, eye-popping special effects of all time. A triumph of science, imagination, and excitement, a mind-blowing adventure that you can enjoy again and again. ***Â½",Null,1,2,13 February 2002
Beetlejuice," very enjoyable
","In this imaginative and innovative comedy Baldwin and Davis are a happily married couple who have the misfortune of adapting to life after death when they're unexpectedly killed. When an obnoxious family moves into their once ideal home, they call on the services of an irksome bio-exorcist (Keaton) whose job is to get rid of the living! Considering the film's subject matter you might expect this to be much too dark for young children, but it's disarmingly pleasant and consistently laugh-out loud funny, with an over-the-top performance from Keaton, unique visual effects that really grab your attention, and a clever, original premise. ***",Null,1,2,7 March 2002
The Simpsons Movie," mostly for fans but still funny and good-natured
","Based on the beloved television show comes this enjoyable animated feature centering around Springfield's lovable suburban family. The story chronicles hapless dope Homer, loyal wife Marge, intelligent do-gooder Lisa, troublemaker Bart, and precocious baby Maggie in a doomsday scenario when they inadvertently cause the town to fall under siege, eventually leading a bureaucratic EPA official and the obtuse U.S. President Schwarzenegger to call for its extermination. Will probably deliver the most satisfaction to dedicated fans of the long-running TV show, but the animation and voice work are terrific, and there are consistently funny gags, in-jokes, and parodies. Story isn't very inspired, and the jokes never reach the level of uproarious, but it's pleasant and easy enough to take. ***",Null,1,4,31 July 2007
Dodgeball," a bland formula redeemed to a surprising extent by good casting
","Predictable but immensely likable and funny farce/beating the odds story centering around a burned-out gym owner (Vaughn) and his gang of oddball, out of shape employees who must band together to save their shabby gym from foreclosure. With the help of an aging legend (Torn), they must enter a national dodgeball competition and lock horns with a detestable fitness egomaniac (Stiller) and his team of superior athletes. By the numbers, to be sure, in fact you'll probably swear you've seen it before, but it's well-cast with some good gags that make for more laugh-out loud moments than you'd expect. Torn has, by far, the film's best role and adds life whenever he's on screen. **½",Null,0,1,13 June 2005
The Fighter," some limitations here and there yet still a good film
","David O. Russell presents the true story of 'Irish' Micky Ward, a gritty, two-bit boxer who strived to beat the odds and become world champion. The story focuses specifically on his relationships over the years with his troubled older brother and trainer Dicky—a former boxer who battled a drug-addiction and frequent run-ins with the law, his mother and manager Alice—who always felt that she knew what was best for him, and his girlfriend Charlene—who sought to steer him away from his detrimental family ties. Genre is familiar so the story elements aren't all that surprising, but it's still compelling, and bolstered by solid direction, believable fight scenes, and first-rate performances. Bale—in yet another memorable, disparate role—is outstanding, Wahlberg a perfect fit, Adams excellent in the kind of role you'd never expect to see her in. Leo also scores as the hard-nosed matriarch of Bale and Wahlberg's family. ***",Null,0,2,30 December 2010
Up in the Air," an excellent, multilayered film
","Clooney is a detached but skilled corporate downsizer who makes a living by traveling around the United States and firing employees for the higher-ups who lack the spine to do it themselves. Despite a lack of personal ties, he's content with his life and unyielding philosophy, but reaches a crossroads when he meets two vastly different women: ambitious, icy Kendrick-a young hotshot who wants to 'glocalize' his job, and sexy, sassy Farmiga-his female counterpart with whom he has trysts on the road. A thoughtful, well-crafted, and thoroughly engrossing story with believable characters and situations, colorful dialogue, laugh-out loud humor, and poignant life themes, made all the more provocative by three leads who are at the top of their game; a terrific all-around showing. ***",Null,1,1,26 November 2018
The Island," either you accept it or you don't
","From the director of Bad Boys and Armageddon comes this futuristic thriller that explores the notion of human cloning. McGregor plays a man who lives in a controlled environment where human contact is prohibited, true emotions don't exist, and everyone dreams of winning a vacation to a mysterious island with no questions asked. When he finally does question his seemingly futile existence and the work of its shady doctor (Bean), he finds out more then he ever imagined endangering his own life and also that of his closest friend (Johansson). Has a bit more substance than previous Bay efforts, and a plot that actually holds your interest, but relies predominantly on action scenes for effect and lacks a really solid finale. You'll either buy into it and go along for the ride, or just be left feeling nothing at all. The cast is good though and gives it their best. **½",Null,0,0,16 August 2005
Furious 7," does what it's supposed to do, though unlikely to resonate for non-fans
","The family of street racers are back, again; there are personal matters at stake, again; circumstances have forced them to team up for one last ride, again. Having successfully defeated criminal mastermind Owen Shaw, members of the crew have gone their separate ways. Little did they know about Shaw's big, bad-and ingeniously resourceful-brother Deckard, who comes lurking out of the shadows for revenge (heretofore unseen big brother comes to avenge little brother, truly a novel cinematic idea!). Add to the mix a few other ruthless bad guys, some shady and seemingly indestructible federal agents, a beautiful woman with brains, some rough-and-tumble fight scenes, one ridiculously over-the-top action sequence after another, and the stage is set for pretty much everything you've come to expect from this long-running franchise. Logic, character development, and story continuity/credibility take a backseat to needless exposition, crowd-pleasing one-liners, and superfluous action set pieces, like you'd expect, but the presence of series veterans, effective casting in key roles, and knowledge that this is the late Paul Walker's final film give it much more weight than it should. **",Null,62,148,3 April 2015
