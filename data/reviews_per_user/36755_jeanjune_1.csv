The Ring," You wanna start to stop watching TV? Then see this
","i saw all three of ring versions Japanese, korean, and american... i think this american version was not that bad as long as about spooky air they are trying give. but the diffrence between two culture was something too much to overcome. i mean there aren't any true heart-grip ghost thriller ,not horor, flick in hollywood. they have always been making zombies and zombies except some like 'the others' and 'six sense'. personally i don't enjoy seeing a horor flicks but always seem to get those when they came out. they make you feel alive, you know when i saw ringue at 23, not only was it well-made also scared hell out of me so that i didn't watch a TV alone in my won room for a while.i give edge to original version to every aspect. so those who didn't get scared, watch japnese original version and be happy. and who get scared of this dull american version NEVER WATCH IT! BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS NO WAY THAT YOU CAN SEE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.",6,0,0,12 January 2003
