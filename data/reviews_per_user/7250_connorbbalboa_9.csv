Blade Runner 2049," Completely over-hyped and undeserving of the praise
","I never was one of those people asking for a Blade Runner sequel. Now that Blade Runner 2049 is out, my position still stands. This film is simply a massive letdown and nothing more.The year is 2049 and the world has grown in technology, but not humanity. Ryan Gosling plays K, a Blade Runner (a futuristic cop) tasked with tracking down the last of the Replicants-androids that look like humans. Knowing that he himself is a replicant, he goes on a journey of his own when he finds a box containing the bones of a Replicant who gave birth to a child and is tasked with finding the child. Little does he know that the new head of the Tyrell Corporation that makes the Replicants, Mr. Wallace (Jared Leto), plans to use the missing child for his own purposes and kill K if he has to.My main problem with the film is that it was unforgivably boring. The film is two hours and forty-five minutes long, which is already enough to test one's patience (and bladder), but it feels so deliberately paced; the characters almost always move so slow, that it feels like the filmmakers thought that it was the best way to pad out the running time, despite having not enough material to justify it.The performances range from great to laughable. Harrison Ford is hardly in the movie, and his inclusion is clearly a marketing ploy, but he gives the best performance in his brief running time and he feels like a continuation of his character from the original, Deckard, in a world where things have just gotten worse. Gosling isn't bad as K, and his stone-face actually is pretty effective in a couple of scenes, but Rutger Hauer in the original gave his Replicant character more of a personality. Leto is trying and failing to bring a degree of menace as the villain, and his female Replicant sidekick competes with him in the field of phoning it in.What else shocked me was how unsubtle the film was. The original was not only a futuristic crime noir that had Harrison Ford's Deckard chasing down androids, but also a personal journey involving himself and Rutger Hauer as the villain that involved trying to find a degree of humanity in such a futuristic world, and that maybe, Deckard is a replicant himself. Here, the story is mainly of Gosling trying to come to terms with the fact that he is a Replicant and what it means in terms of his humanity. Whereas in the original, there were subtle signs, images, and bits of dialogue that hinted at Deckard's purpose in the original, everything is spelled out for the audience to the point that old bits of dialogue are repeated thrice at important moments. It doesn't respect the audience's intelligence at all. The first and final thirds of the film are mainly filled with dialogue that is basically speeches that preach ideas about conflict and the ethics of machines, but hardly any of it is explored in an interesting fashion. What's worse, the film feels so empty and devoid that for a time, I forgot what K's objective was.What I will say is that the cinematography is beautiful. There are a lot of colorful images with ancient ruins and futuristic tech in the background and foreground that could easily pass as being part of an art gallery. The only downside is that there is too much gray in some shots and it feels too clean compared to the original.Why Warner Brothers and Sony wasted their time making this film, I have no clue. Maybe it was Ridley Scott's fault. After being unimpressed with his Alien: Covenant earlier this year (and was also quite the snooze-fest), watching this only proved to me further that Scott just doesn't care about good filmmaking anymore. Denis Villeneuve is clearly an ambitious director, but his style didn't feel completely right for this film. Clearly, in a film that tries so desperately to say much more humanity than its predecessor, it comes out feeling empty and feels less human than the original did.P.S. A lot of people have accused me of being too shallow and wanting this film to be more action packed. I do not have that mindset. I enjoy films that take their time as much as the next film enthusiast, but this one just didn't do enough to justify what it was aiming for. I'm not ashamed in expressing my opinion. Just let me be clear on something: going at a slow, deliberate pace and speaking lines of preachy dialogue does not, I repeat, does not equal intelligence. The positive reviews baffle me, especially on Rotten Tomatoes. Sony owns the company, which leads me to think that maybe it bribed more than a few critics in the hopes that more people would see it. Clearly, that is backfiring and I'm happy that people are rejecting it.",3,381,735,7 October 2017
Rocky V," A desperate sequel with a poor script and cringe-worthy finale
","Sylvester Stallone once said he strictly made Rocky V to make a few dollars. Perhaps that explains why this Rocky film has hardly anything to offer. The first two Rocky films had great stories and really likable characters that you rooted for, so much so that you didn't care about how unbelievable some of the circumstances regarding the fights may have been. Rocky III didn't do it as effectively, but made up for it with some great entertainment value and a feeling of self- awareness regarding Stallone's career for the next couple of decades. Rocky IV threw all seriousness out the door and the quality steeped even more than with Rocky III, but it can be entertaining on a primitive level, similar to Stallone's other 1985 hit, Rambo: First Blood Part II. This film offers almost nothing special. It wants to be gritty and emotional like the first Rocky, but it can't seem to avoid having some scenes that are a bit, shall we say, 'macho;' unfortunately, those parts are out of place with the rest of the film and don't make it more fun. Having just defeated Ivan Drago (watch Rocky IV to understand everything), Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) returns home with his family and finds out that, thanks to Paulie, his brother-in-law (Burt Young), his accountant has stolen all of his money since he has power of attorney. What prevents him from fighting again to win some money is the fact that he has gotten significant brain damage (I can hear the realists saying 'Finally,' since Rocky would've suffered from this long ago if this was real life), and all he can do is auction off his big house, most of his stuff, move back with his family to Paulie's house in the same, poor Philadelphia neighborhood they once lived in, and run the gym of his late trainer and friend, Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith, who appears in a tear-jerking flashback). Also, he trains a young boxing hopeful named Tommy Gunn (real boxer Tommy Morrison, who passed away in 2013), and is harassed by boxing promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant), while ignoring his son (Stallone's real son, Sage), who is beaten up by bullies at school every day. Now, the main problem with Rocky V is its screenplay. First off, the way Rocky loses his money makes little sense; what he thought was a tax extension was really a power of attorney. How could anyone not notice the difference? Also, while Rocky's family thought they had paid fully the mortgage on their house, they still have $400,000 outstanding. Again, how could they have not noticed this? Also, Duke is a one- dimensional villain (a common trope in a lot of Rocky and Rambo sequels it seems) and a cartoon character that jars terribly with how serious the film wants to be. Also, when Tommy is asked by Duke to turn away from Rocky and sign with him, you'd think, given how much Rocky and Tommy seem to bond during the film, that Tommy would have doubts, but not once does he think, 'I dunno: Rocky's my friend. He really got me somewhere. Do I really want to do this?' But no: he just signs with Duke and when he beats the Heavyweight Champion, he only acknowledges Duke and completely ignores Rocky. Rocky's son is another problem with this film. He gets mad that his father won't help him against the bullies, but he later seems to take care of that problem (with physical violence against the bullies, of course) by himself, which just leaves him upset that Rocky is paying more attention to Tommy and not him, which causes him to act like a little punk (on Christmas of all days!!!). Rocky says that having Tommy as his student gives him a purpose in life, but throughout the two montages that show Tommy training and winning fights, there's no sense of development. Tommy's character arc just seems to be made up as the film goes along. First, he seems like a young hopeful who wants to box and eagerly accepts Rocky as his trainer, then he signs on with Duke without any shred of doubt and abandons Rocky, then he beats the Heavyweight Champion and gets mad because everyone thinks he's not good enough to fight strong opponents (the guy Tommy beats only got the title through contract), he challenges Rocky to a fight at Duke's insistence, and then, when Tommy provokes Rocky into a street fight, he yells at Duke, 'You don't own me! Nobody does!' Not to mention, the street fight is an absolutely ridiculous affair that no one in their right mind would shoot for television and just stand aside to watch, and it destroys any credibility the film did have. Rocky V is a complete waste of time and something not worth spending a few dollars to watch on demand or ten dollars to buy on Blu-Ray. More action-oriented fans can be forgiven for liking Rocky IV, but please stay away from this freak misfit.",3,1,5,28 November 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," One of the few films I have a grudge against.
","Out of all the X-Men films that have come out over the past decade and a half, this is the worst one ever. I hate this movie with all my passion and I think it is undeserving to be in the X-Men canon. What angers me even more about it is that this film is based off a great origin story from the comics and it has been horribly tainted by just about everyone involved, except Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber.The plot is basically retelling most of the important details about Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) origin, being discovering his bone claws as a child, fighting in different wars, his relationship with a Native American woman named Silverfox, his time on Team X and in Weapon X, getting the adamantium claws and his grudge against Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber). Also, there are numerous things added that were never part of the origin that just come off as the movie trying to show off other characters for the sake of it. For instance, Blob was never part of Team X and yet he's on the team as a normal-looking guy, and later, he becomes the Blob and used as the butt of a lot of jokes, particularly in a boxing match he has with Wolverine so Wolvie can get info. from him. Wolvie really would have just threatened to cut him open if he was truly like his comic book counterpart or anything like he was in the previous films, not to mention that Wolvie's adamantium skeleton and healing factor would both be strong advantages. Also, Gambit, one of everyone's favorite X-Men (I never liked him) also appears, but it's only for a couple of short scenes and his role is incredibly inconsequential. That is the least of the problems here.One major problem is the terrible special effects. Many are obviously computer-generated, and the contenders for the worst looking ones include the Patrick Stewart recreation and Wolverine's claws, which were a combination of practical and digital claws in the original trilogy. Usually, films with imperfect special effects can be forgiven if everything else in the film works. For instance, the effects in E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial are not ground-breaking, but because I loved the story, soundtrack, and the title character, I didn't care. However, the story and characters here are terrible, so there is no excuse.The characters are also all expendable, from Colonel Stryker (Danny Huston) to Silverfox. Most of the guys in Weapon X are just there to show off their 'cool' powers like Agent Zero's agility, Wraith's (WILL.I.AM) teleportation, and Blob's resistance to gunfire. The scene with Team X raiding an African compound is a special offender in this category. So much time is made for showing off each of these guy's powers, Wolvie and Sabretooth don't get a chance to shine. In X2, it was implied that Wolvie was a much worse person than he eventually became when on Stryker's team, and the film fails to explore that completely. Because these guys on Team X are given no character beyond their bad-a$$ery and their powers, I don't care what happens to them. People say that Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson was the standout among them, but I don't think he was able to prove himself as that character until 2016's Deadpool. Lynn Collins as Silverfox in particular has some of the worst dialogue and acting in the film, and the fact that her (fake) death in the film is Wolverine's reason for getting his adamantium makes the whole thing much more cliché.A lot of the events in the film don't make sense either. Why does Stryker order his men to blow Wolvie up when Wolvie has a healing factor and the adamantium in his skeleton makes him nigh-indestructible? How does Gambit run back down the alleyway and run back the same way on a rooftop when Wolvie knocked him out before fighting Sabretooth? Why does Wraith try to kill Sabretooth with his bare hands when he knows that Sabretooth has a healing factor? Why is Wolvie reacting to his claws in amazement instead of agony like the X2 flashbacks clearly show? How do adamantium bullets erase Wolvie's memory? That is unacceptable. What does Stryker hope to accomplish by combining the powers of several mutants into Wade, especially when more powerful mutants like Magneto and Professor Xavier could defeat him? How does Wolvie and Sabretooth being brothers add anything to their grudge? Why can't Sabretooth survive the adamantium procedure but Wolvie can, even though they have the same powers? Why do Silverfox's powers work on Wolvie but not Sabretooth? Why? What? How? The only good thing I can say about this movie is that despite being manipulated by the very poor script, Jackman and Schreiber do what they can with the characters of Wolvie and Sabretooth. Otherwise, this is a pile of junk that is so bad that even before the Days of Future Past retcon, the makers of this series started to forget its existence. It should have been more true to Wolverine's character and been a proper prequel to the original X-Men trilogy and NOT an advertisement for other characters and a poorly-written, clichéd superhero movie. I give this movie the least amount of praise possible and condemn it for the rest of its existence.",1,0,3,18 January 2017
Rocky IV," The day the Rocky series died (until 2006 that is)
","There is something to be said about film series that start with great, serious filmmaking, and then descend into goofball antics as they go on. The Rocky series is one of the definitive examples of this. The first Rocky was an excellent film that told a great story about a great character who was brought to life thanks to Sylvester Stallone's charm and raw acting. Rocky II was a fantastic sequel which, despite a couple of problems, managed to keep the viewer rooting for our favorite underdog champion. Rocky III started these antics with the Hulk Hogan wrestling match and Rocky relying more on showbiz than actual heart and talent, but it still had room for genuine human drama and was a self-aware metaphor about having too much of a good thing and how one becomes a different person when he or she is famous. In a way, I think it predicted how Stallone's career would go for the next couple of decades. It's such a shame that this prediction started to prove itself correct so soon.Rocky IV is considered a favorite to many fans, but it's soulless and has nothing that even resembles the first three films, despite the cast and the flashbacks to them. The story is, after the events of Rocky III, Rocky lives the quiet life until his new friend Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) asks him to be his trainer in an exhibition fight against Soviet Union boxer Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren); Drago is a fresh face in the Soviet Union who is the World Amateur Champion of Boxing and who is given steroids by his superiors to increase his strength and punching power. Apollo is ultimately disgraced as he is killed by Drago in a pretty short fight, and Rocky has to train in Russia and fight Drago himself to prove that good ol' America is better than the Soviets.You might've guessed this, but the main reason I really don't like this film is because of how goofy it is even when compared to the first three films. The fact that Rocky is fighting a big muscular steroid-pumped boxer a decade and a half his junior alone takes the cake in ridiculousness. Everyone knows that as the series went on, Rocky's condition became more unrealistic, but here, it reaches a peak in lack of credibility; if the fight happened in real life, it would have been over in 30 seconds. And while the Rocky films are not really a go-to on how to box, there was something to each of the final fights in the previous films. Here, Rocky and Drago are just beating the crap out of each other with the sole objective of making the other person stay down. But Rocky keeps coming despite the punishment; if Rocky seems to be doing fine despite this, then there are no stakes. Also, there is a big musical sequence before the Apollo/Drago fight and is all flashy and is only meant to show up Drago, as Apollo is still a cocky son of a gun (you'd think that there would be some character development after a few movies)Also, Rocky's brother in law, Paulie (Burt Young) has a robot that has no purpose in the film other than to add comedy and look sleek. Apparently, the robot was a legit thing that was used to promote autistic awareness; Stallone put it in the film because he thought it looked pretty cool. That gives you an idea of the mentality behind this movie.It also feels like Stallone has run out of ways to write proper dialogue for this series, as many of the moments of dialogue don't feel genuine and there is some dialogue that is rather weak.The Soviet bad guys are pretty one-dimensional and Drago, other than his fighting prowess is unimpressive as a human being; he doesn't speak (an intentional acting choice from Lundgren) and his dialogue sounds so monotone (trying to emphasize him as a robot). Brigitte Nielsen plays his wife and her acting is very unconvincing. Drago's superiors' main objective with the final fight is to prove how weak the U.S. is, and they have no qualms about Apollo's death. Bottom line it's pretty simple what the movie is saying: Americans: good, Soviets: bad. Again, it feels like there are no personal stakes for Rocky.Rocky IV is simply a bad movie that tarnishes what Stallone accomplished with the original Rocky in 1976 and should be avoided by those who have any respect for that film. Viewers watching the series for the first time should skip this one and Rocky V and go straight to Rocky Balboa once they've gotten past Rocky III.",4,1,3,12 November 2016
Gandhi," A simple collage of events and a big lie
","As a film lover, I have recently gotten suspicious of biopics and historical films. These kinds of movies tend to sugarcoat the truth to present almost typical Hollywood stories, for instance, making some people who weren't all that bad, the main villains, simply so the audiences can identify an antagonist (The Aviator is a big offender in this category). Gandhi (1982) falls into many of the these traps that other biopics fall into and as a result, becomes an over- glorification, a complete lie, and something that almost doesn't resemble a story, but merely a collage of events.The film basically presents us with the major events of Gandhi's career: his time working against British oppression of Indians as a lawyer in South Africa, the Amritsar massacre, the March of Salt, Gandhi's assassination, etc. The events are simply presented, very accurately from what I read about them, but the film leaves out many things about him that weren't very noble. Reading about events in Gandhi's life from all different sources, like books and online articles, I can safely say that I am appalled by some of the things that this man has done.When fighting British oppression of Indians in South Africa, he basically ignored native South Africans that have lived in the country much longer than any Indian or British person. Second, he was cruel to his family, so much so that his son spoke out against him and later died as a drunk; he even negatively compared his own wife to a cow. Additionally, when his wife was sick, he refused to give her British medicine and yet was willing to take it himself when he had malaria. After Hitler came to power and WWII started, he wrote to Hitler, addressing him as a friend, and after the war was over, he himself said that many of the Jews from the Holocaust should have let themselves die and submit to the oppression of the Nazis. Any sensible man or woman would know that this is could be nothing more than an insane and horrible suggestion and that it would be simply impossible to deal with the Nazis using Gandhi's ideas. This was the Gandhi that so many people idolized? I even read an article from The Guardian saying that a biography about Gandhi was forbidden for publication because it revealed too many things about his life.Other than the fact that the film is lying to everyone who sees it, the film is just too preachy. It doesn't barrage you with moral lessons every second of screen time, but half of the dialogue is moral lessons and guidelines on life and doesn't feel very natural. Even in the beginning, when it shows Gandhi's funeral, an announcer covering the funeral outright tells the audience (indirectly) what to think of Gandhi and how others, like Albert Einstein viewed him, and that we should view him that way too. Richard Attenborough, the director and producer, was actually advised against glorifying Gandhi. I don't get why he didn't take that advice to heart, considering that this was a passion project to him. Even some of the British officials in the film act like two-dimensional bad guys. One of the only positive things I can say about this film is that Ben Kingsley nails it as this film's version of Gandhi. He makes me wish that the Gandhi that has been glorified by the world was a real person, instead of the flawed and sometimes frightening human being that actually existed on this Earth. The film also has a genuinely good message, but like I said, it's just turned into a preachy sermon throughout most of the movie.What else can I say? I was so disappointed to realize that so much of this man's life was left out and simplified simply to be more Hollywood-friendly and attract more crowds. That is complete BS. What a movie biopic should do, I think, is have the courage to present the uglier details of a person's life and as a result, feel more challenging. Plus, don't preach a moral lesson to us if a person lived by one, because that's being unsubtle. Let us figure it out for ourselves. Some of those things I said were applied in the excellent film, Raging Bull, by Martin Scorsese. Not only is the film mostly true to life, according to Jake LaMotta, whom the film was based on, but it wasn't afraid to portray LaMotta as a brute of a man like he was in his boxing heyday and it didn't outright tell you what to think of LaMotta or how he was thinking; instead, it kept you guessing with Robert De Niro's performance and the cinematography. Gandhi is just too afraid to turn a man who undeniably made major contributions to humanity into anything less than what people wish to see him as. As a result, this film is disgraceful and is too much of a piece of Oscar bait to be genuinely good. I'm sorry, members of the Academy, but you made a terrible choice for the Best Picture of 1982.",3,8,15,22 January 2017
Flashdance," Style over substance, galore!
","Style-over-substance films usually annoy me. When those movie are as bad as Flashdance, I just want to ask the people who made them what they were thinking. Actually, this was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, who are well known for making films of cinematic gloss, but nothing with real humanity. The story is so simple, the whole thing is probably 50 minutes too long. This is basically Rocky if the story has dance scenes for filler, the numerous subplots went nowhere, and the characters weren't appealing.For a story, Jennifer Beals plays a young girl named Alex who wants to be a professional dancer, and not just to dance at a small nightclub. By day, she works as a welder at a steel mill; shocking since she is only 18. The steel mill boss's son falls in love with her and later tries to help her get into the professional dance group that she yearns to be a part of, if only she had more confidence.Everything that I highlighted in just three sentences is everything there is to know about the main story. Everything else is just music video-inspired dancing scenes (which, unfortunately, are mostly performed by Beals's body double instead of Beals herself) set to popular 80s songs, and subplots that go nowhere or are resolved in five minutes. For one thing, Alex sees the boss's son with his previous wife, she gets mad and throws a rock at his window, but the next day, he explains why his ex-wife was with him in the first place. Later, her friend joins a sleazy strip club, and Alex forces her to leave after three minutes. There is even an old woman who is Alex's friend, and conveniently, was also a famous dancer. Not enough time is spent on the relationship they have and the film never establishes how they met.The acting is average at best, with Beals giving the warmest performance of the whole cast, and most of the characters act like old stereotypes, such as the pathetic friend who makes useless jokes (which leads to another sub-plot that goes nowhere) and the aggressive jocks who have eyes for the main heroine. Alex herself is also the victim of the horrible screenplay. Close to the beginning of the film, she actually does come close to signing up for an audition for the dance group, but she backs out because she is afraid. Not a good enough reason? Well, the film still has an hour and fifteen minutes left, and if she did get her confidence at that moment, it would be nothing more than a short film.I have very little to say about Flashdance because the film offers so little. I guess the dance scenes are well shot, and Beals performance makes things a little more tolerable, but everything else is quite awful. Even some of the 80s songs are poor. This is easily one of the most uninteresting pieces of nothing ever made.",2,0,1,26 September 2017
Logan," 'Logan, you still have time...'
","I had a hard time just coming up with a title for this review. Because, honestly, how important is that when talking about a film like Logan? It's probably one of the few superhero movies I've seen that deserves to be called perfect. I just went to see this with a friend, and we agree that this film excited us, shocked the hell out of us, and presented us with characters that we love and are now all broken down, and a genuinely great story that follows how they spend their final days.The plot here is that Wolverine, or James Howlett, or Logan (Hugh Jackman) is spending his days driving people around the city for cash to buy medicine for the now emotionally-broken and physically declining Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) with the help of fellow surviving mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant) who can't go out into the sun without burning severely. Logan himself is declining too, with scars forming on his body and his healing factor working much slower than before. Everything changes when Laura (Dafne Keen) walks into their lives and asks to be taken to a place called Eden in North Dakota. All the while, they are pursued by Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) and Dr. Zandar Rice (Richard E. Grant), who want Laura back.What I will say right now is that this movie will break the hearts of anyone who loves X-Men and the character of Wolverine. I can't give anything away, but I will tell you that there are moments that show you how much people like Logan and Xavier can screw up and how they have to live with their mistakes. Logan himself is at his lowest point and he convincingly acts in a way where you wonder who the man was underneath that Adamantium skeleton and those berserker rages. Xavier himself plays off Jackman very well. He talks like a bitter old grandfather at times who is unhappy with his 'son' and yet acts like a grandfather who has the opposite personality: loving, understanding, and sharing his wisdom of the world with Laura. A scene where they watch Shane (1953) is especially touching.Despite what other critics have said, the villains are great here. Holbrook is properly cruel and twisted and Grant plays the kind of villain you want to hate. The fact is, neither of them play super-powered bad guys who want to take over the world. This is one superhero film where I wouldn't have cared if the villains didn't get much backstory or dimension, because it is not their story; they are just forces that Logan and co. keep running into and are part of a less tolerant and more unfriendly government.The violence is done well and Logan slicing his enemies up in a gory fashion is something we finally get to see. Here, Wolvie stabs people in places we haven't seen him stab before and whenever those claws do strike somebody, there's always blood. Logan shows that even though he's old, he's still a pro, and even then, we see that every new wound he receives in his state just slows him down even more and makes him worse.Dafne Keen is definitely something of a complete surprise in terms of child acting. Even though she doesn't say much for most of the film, she nails the aggressive stares and animalistic and child-like tendencies very well. When she cries and is frightened, it feels very real, and not annoying like with many child actors. In fact, some may consider this a stretch, but she might be the best child actor I have ever seen in a movie.The film seems to take a lot of cues from something like Mad Max, with similar desert landscapes, and the story of an aging iconic character who needs to get past his emotional pain and redeem himself is still exciting here. It worked with Rocky Balboa and James Bond in Skyfall, and it works here. It's clear that Logan feels pain and through his conversations with Xavier, it's obvious that he needs redemption. Its great script (filled with numerous earned curse words) drives one in to see if Logan actually achieves it.To end, Logan is a fantastic movie. Period. Not 'superhero' movie. This film will most likely make you question how good other superhero movies that you've seen really are, as it's doing to me now. I'm not kidding; this film will provide you with emotional satisfaction and leave you feeling like you had seen not a superhero movie, but something else entirely. Just be sure to bring plenty of tissues, because it will screw you up inside.",10,4,10,3 March 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Do not see this film.
","Here's the truth: I was skeptical about this movie before it was released. I was very nervous about Jesse Eisenberg's turn as Lex Luthor and the final trailer made me predict the outcome of the movie. After watching the movie, my fear was correct. I'll say it right now. I. hate. this. movie. I hate it with all of my passion. I feel like I want to destroy the print for this pile of trash. Ben Affleck manages to prove everyone who thought he would do poorly as Batman wrong and does a great job portraying the character, and the fight, when it finally happens, is awesome. However, these are the only positive aspects. First off, this movie feels so one-sided, it is so easy to tell that the filmmakers liked Batman way more than Superman. It is clear in almost every part of the film; Batman is always on top of things and Superman is always getting trashed by the government and the press and getting the short end of the stick. You wonder after you watch it, 'Will Batman lead the Justice League too?' Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster who created Superman would be really upset, and so would Richard Donner, who helped create the first two classic Superman movies with Christopher Reeve. Reeve if he was still alive would hate the disrespect towards the character as well. I wish he would rise from the dead to beat up this 'movie.' We've had enough modern movies that did Batman well. Try doing Superman right in this modern age for once. Wonder Woman is o.k., but the problem is she only is around in a few scenes, and only one of those has any reason for her to be around: to fight Doomsday in the end. If she was not in the movie, there would almost be no difference. Jesse Eisenberg is so terrible as Lex Luthor, I wanted somebody in the movie to kill that jerk because he was so annoying. I've had enough of villains in superhero movie who are nerds. Electro in Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Aldrich Killian in Iron Man 3 sucked. Why are super villains who are movie nerds getting more attention these days? Amy Adams is o.k. as Lois Lane but she is given almost nothing significant to do. She also makes a stupid decision at the end of the movie that is clearly a flaw in the screenplay. Everything happens in this movie without feeling significant; Batman and Superman's different points of view are given only a minimum amount of attention and those points of view are not the main reason they fight. While I think the fight is great, it is again pretty one-sided, and the setup and reasons for the fight are terrible. I also think there is too much stylized filmmaking going on here, with closeups on objects like bullets and cannons with slow motion being a prime example. Why? There is also a scene in this film that shows Batman as a kid falling into a bat cave and being lifted out by the bats. What? Quite a few scenes in this film have nothing to do with the main story and are clearly only put in to foreshadow the Justice League movie. The ending's only purpose is also to set up the Justice League movie. Doomsday, who only appears in the end as a grab to pull comic book and superhero fans in, looks very generic and only later in the battle does he start to look like the character in the comics. Finally, the fact that this is called Batman vs. Superman and is not really about how they will fight each other, come to their senses, then fight and defeat a major baddie, is just wrong. This movie should have been called 'Justice League Begins,' because that's a more accurate feeling from watching this movie. The more you understand it, the more it becomes clear that this movie only exists to set up a cinematic universe that wants to kick Marvel's butt and become the hot new thing in superhero movies. Well, I'm not buying it, Warner Brothers. Man of Steel also had problems, with a screenplay filled with contradictory moments and things that don't make sense, as well as a tone that makes you feel tired, but Man of Steel looks great compared to this. I hope whoever cast Jesse Eisnberg is fired from the movie business, I hope Warner Brother is disgraced by this piece of cinematic garbage, and I hope the DC Cinematic Universe is prematurely canceled. This movie fits into a Hall of Shame with other superhero movie odysseys of disgrace like X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Batman and Robin, Superman III and IV, and Amazing Spider-Man 2. I, a true fan of both Batman and Superman, curse this movie and the whole DC cinematic universe.",1,8,20,25 March 2016
Spectre," The weakest of the Daniel Craig Bond films
","The ending of Skyfall was very promising, as it showed James Bond finally manning up and becoming the brilliant secret agent that everyone knows once again. He was ready to take on new missions and possibly provide more stories that could expand on his character. Well, we got a partially traditional Bond, and it sucked. If not for other disasters like Moonraker and Die Another Day, I would call this the worst of the Bond films. Why, might you ask? Well, for one thing, the film is too long and too slow. Two-and-a-half hours is pretty extreme for a Bond film. Yes, Skyfall was slightly shorter, but it truly felt like 'the' epic Bond story that gave people something special. Here, we have a typical Bond adventure that has additional pieces of filler that we didn't need like the talk about drones and surveillance that Skyfall weaved into its story much better. Other old Bond tropes come about that I'm really tired of at this point; it's been a while, though, since I've seen an action scene on a train in one of these movies.Another problem is the performances. Ralph Fiennes is fine as M and shows himself to be very capable. Ben Whishaw is also good as Q, and he's almost as fun to watch as Desmond Llewelyn was in his Bond films. However, Craig is inconsistent this time as Bond. Sometimes he looks invested, but other times he looks tired. Lea Seydoux was also very dull as the newest Bond girl, Madeline Swan, and Christoph Waltz as Blofeld (let's not kid ourselves here) sucks. He's more like an annoying cartoon villain I would have expected from some of the earlier films than a worthy threat. He's no Le Chiffre or Raoul Silva. And the fact that Bond didn't just shoot him dead at the end like a truly tough Bond would left me feeling very unsatisfied.The story is that after a mission in Mexico that he undertook himself, Bond is suspended from field duty and undertakes a secret mission when he finds a video that has M telling him to seek out a specific target if something happened to her (Was there any reason she couldn't have told him about this during the end of Skyfall?). In Rome, Bond finds out about a secret villainous organization named Spectre (not an acronym), and is tasked by Mr. White from Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace to protect his daughter, Madeline. Together, they find Bond's believed-to-be-dead half-brother, Franz Oberhauser, who claims to be responsible for the events of the previous three films(????). This is basically the main plot condensed into a single paragraph, unlike the movie. Hmm.....The big 'twist' about Oberhauser being responsible for the previous films and being Blofeld is what ruins the rest of the film for me. It clearly demonstrates that the film can't decide whether it wants to be a traditional Bond adventure, or a more serious adventure like Casino Royale. The whole backstory is that after Bond's parents died, Oberhauser's father took Bond in and Franz got extremely jealous and offed his dad...instead of killing Bond and making it look accidental for some reason. Then...for some reason he decides to call himself Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Blofeld was his mother's maiden name, conveniently). Then...for some reason he decides to form Spectre and have control of the world. Next thing, he'd be saying that he lost Le Chiffre's money so the events of Casino Royale would happen or that he got Silva out of his jam with the Chinese so he could take revenge on Bond when it was clear that Silva was acting out of more personal motivations. What bull. What in the name of God were you thinking, Sam Mendes? You ought to be ashamed of yourself for allowing such poor writing to be part of your movie. And I'm not invested in Bond trying to rescue Madeline because the performances don't move me.Bottom line, if the 25th Bond film features Craig again, I hope that that film can correct the mistakes of this film. However, as it stands, this is the final Bond film with Craig as of yet, and it's a truly sucky way to end things. This franchise has seen better days, regardless of how few and far between they were.",2,5,10,1 March 2017
