Ali," Most inspiring film of the year
","This is probably the most motivational film of the year. The life of Cassius Clay/ Muhammad Ali. Portrayed quite realistically and raw. The story about the life of a big-mouth, know-it-all boxer.The Academy Awards nomination for Will Smith was more than justified. His attitude, his goofy remarks to his opponents, even his looks made the image of Ali come to life. The character development in the movie was very commendable. Although his love life may have not been presented as successfully as it could be.The camera work was superb. The movement during the fight scenes and the lighting really made the fights look spectacular and moments of Ali's self-reflection profound. A contrast, crucial at showing Ali's diverse life as a boxer and fighter for civil rights. He was a civil rights leader, only that he was not aware of that until he came to Zaire.Fights were amazing. Rough, nicely choreographed (notice the foot movement of Ali) and realistic. They were somewhat fair (the opponents resigned) and very tense. The camera's view from one of the fighters chest adds immensely to our realizing of the pressure, Ali was facing.Directing and acting are also top-notch. But one thing surpasses it all. The soundtrack. The score for Ali and the music are the two things that really shine. Rarely have I seen a movie so well intertwined with it's music. Sam Cooke at the beginning, Dungeon East performing Set Me Free, the African theme in Zaire, R.Kelly's theme during the last fight, it all moulds into the atmosphere of Ali.Jon Voight is also quite amusing as Cosell, the journalist (who I could hardly recognize) who made Ali the icon, people know and admire. And so did Don King, but he was more interested in Ali moneywise, as is clearly shown before the fight with Foreman.Altogether, the movie presents Ali as he was - a fighter, a 'bad' husband, for whom wives worry too much and an icon, which will not be forgotten.Michael Mann, you have done a great job.",Null,0,0,31 March 2002
X-Men," Minor glitches, major entertainment
","Before seeing this movie I've read many reviews of X-Men: The Movie and they were all about how this movie sucked. Some critics even described it as a plastic heap of overrated garbage. Well, I strictly oppose.First of all, the movie had a quite decent cast - Patrick Stewart was right in his place and Hugh Jackman added a bit of freshness into the movie. Ian McKellen, however, was not as good as in his previous roles (Apt Pupil) as his character appeared somewhat too calm or even sedated. But still the dialogue between him as Magneto and Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier were quite vivid and sarcastic.I also have to say that the effects were satisfying and from the middle onward quite surprisingly well fitted into the movie. Not too much, not too little. Just to support the plot. But the plot is another thing. It is the only thing that seemed only a bit over the average. Intro was O.K. But somewhere in the middle the initial line of mutants fighting for equality was quickly replaced by mutant fighting mutant fighting human.Directing and editing were average, but most people would say that is not important in action or sci-fi movies - Matrix, Odyssey 2010. Apparently not.I am a fan of the comic book and therefore I can see that the adaptation is quite good. The costumes are portrayed brilliantly (look at the descriptions of the suits in the comic books and you will notice this). Personalities of the characters are a bit two-dimensional (that does not go for Jackman and Stewart), but the interaction is, though rare, quite humorous.To put all into place, I give this movie an 8 out of 10. Anybody should see this movie and you may find yourself getting interested into the comic book or wind up owning the movie, like me.BTW: Viewing the DVD version is a very good idea...all you fans, don't miss it!!!",8,0,0,13 November 2000
Spider-Man," Admirable
","Spider-Man is easily one of the best comics-to-screen adaptation ever. After the not-so-good attempts by Batman, Spawn (very underrated), X-Men and other superheroes (Superman did quite well), Spider-Man does, what no other has. It is an ultimate thrill-ride, with good computer generated scenes, the humor, the villain, the atmosphere and most of all - the action. All of it makes this movie a wonderful experience.Tobey Maguire is wonderful in the role of Peter Parker and with his sort-of 'loser' character approaches everyone of us. When he becomes Spider-Man, everyone of us somehow does too. He relates to us, as he is shown completely human, troubled and has gone through great loss of his loved ones. His adapting to his strengths is very funny. His character is very-well developed, something, we could not say for the rest of the characters.
Mary Jane was well portrayed by Kirsten Dunst, but her character lacked in depth. Her attraction towards Peter was baffling, as she hadn't noticed him for six years since they've moved next to him. The best character, however, is Harry Osborn (Willem Dafoe), who acts as a desperate man, who realizes that family is more important too late and is haunted by his dementia in the form of the Green Goblin. Great casting.All in all, the movie forms a much clearer message than its predecessors in superhero movies - with great power comes great responsibility. Compliments to Sam Raimi for this great portrayal of this great superhero.Highly recommended.Leo Zingy*****/*****",10,0,0,13 May 2002
