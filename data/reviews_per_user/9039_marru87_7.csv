Maybe, but really, I loved this movie!",Null,0,0,5 October 2003

Moulin Rouge!," Tears!
","Do you know, how much I cryed, when I saw this movie first time? Well, I can tell you, that I cryed pretty much...And now, when I have seen it for about 7 times, I still cry! It is just so sad! Ewan McGregor is fantastic in this movie, I fell in love with him the first time I saw his face and when he started to sing I almost passed out! Am I exaggerating? No, IÂ´m not. See the movie and cry! And sing, I allways sing Satines parts.... = )",10,1,2,25 July 2002
