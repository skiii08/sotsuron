First Man," Didn't expect this
","Usually space movies are all whooshy and starry, with cool adventure equipment, all polished and clean, with brave heroes all perfect and willing. This film is so totally different I was completely stunned. It's an amazing achievement in all ways, understated, dirty, emotional, scary, brutal, even horrific. Captures what space travel must have been, and how absolutely mad it was to attempt it. Chazelle pulls off something unusual and delicate in among the mess of men playing astronauts, men doing really horrible, filthy, hard work because they believe in mankind, and the women who support them just as tough and adventurous rather than just mommies at home. I want to watch it again - terrifying beginning!",8,1,2,3 March 2019
A Star Is Born," Still implausible
","Although Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper both deserve acting and music nods at the Oscars for this film, with believable performances and a much improved screenplay to the Barbra Streisand version, it still remains an implausible premise. Firstly, there's nobody like Jackson Maine, no superstar who is his age and dresses like that who could walk into a drag bar and be instantly recognized. The closest is someone like Dave Navarro. Adam Levine, Steve Tyler, or Chris Cornell, but Cooper has made his character very old-fashioned, like Neil Young or Kris Kristofferson. Both of whom would not be recognized in a drag bar anyway. I feel like he should have been a rock n roller with eyeliner and rings etc. to be realistic for this generation. Secondly, it's implausible that his country fans would appreciate a woman they never saw before jumping up on stage the second song he performs to sing with him, and then take over! No promoter would agree to this! She could be the support act, but this takeover beggars belief. It just showed a lack of understanding of the music industry. The song she sings in the car park for two seconds he suddenly plays in front of 100,000 people and then she sings it with him, despite them never rehearsing. Also, why on earth would Ally agree to being the next Ariana Grande and whore it up? She was like Adele at the end! Very confusing. Although I suppose Lady Gaga herself took this route, although she was never as tacky and had art to her act. It doesn't add up. It also seems doubtful that Jackson Maine would still be pulling stadiums if he was that washed up. And the other problem, the music is just not epic enough. If he was such a superstar, he needed superstar tunes. He had none. This was also the issue with the previous version, but at least Kris K was actually a superstar in real life, so he seemed more realistic, whereas Barbra didn't. Talking of which, the final song is not a torch song and is pretty lame, so doesn't really work. I think this needs to be the last version of this movie ever because it's out of date and never worked as a music movie in the first place. Having said that, I think both Cooper and Gaga will get and deserve nods if not wins, and cue their duet at the musical interval. Sam Elliott should sweep a supporting actor role award. He was hands down fantastic.",7,0,1,23 December 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Felt like a real movie, hurray!
","So many boring movies with cookie cutter characters out now, and Spike Lee just nails it. I can't say I've been a fan, haven't really liked his characters before now, they always seemed a bit arrogant, but maybe he's chilled too, and now the maturity and experience is showing. It's like Tarantino meets Coen Brothers, and when I say that, I mean the classic elements, but then the Spike Lee twists come into play near the end. The ending made me cry, and I never want to see David Dukes' face again ever, he's a demon.I wasn't keen on some of the pacing, but then again I think it had the pacing of an older movie - try Pulp Fiction now, and you realize movies used to take their time.John David Washington is amazing! Laura Harrier, maybe a bit too pretty, but OK. Adam Driver as always shines it up, so droll, and where did they find all these other amazing black actors? Hollywood, come on, man, loads of great resources! Funny how the best films and shows of recent times are when there's a really properly diverse cast that mixes without always going on about their racial differences, which sound weird when I'm reviewing this film about the deep racism in the US, but it's true, really good writing to make the police team really feel like they care about each other, using black and white differences to do their job.And then you see, ah yes, Jordan Peele and Jason Blum producing. No wonder this is great.By the way, I'm white. Or am I...??????

Marriage Story," Not at all charming or about a marriage
","This is a very dull story of two people who split up for very tenuous reasons and then we have to go through the divorce procedural with lawyers. The spoiled immature brat thinking of only herself and not one second considering her delicate son forces her husband, a richly intelligent and creative man, first out of their bed and then out of her life. I felt no compassion for Scarlett Johansson's character, and spent the whole time wondering why this script was so dull and humorless. I realized then it was because it was written too shallow and didn't explore any nuance whatsover. I don't know how it's being touted so hard, maybe because it's one of three or four non-superhero movies for the Oscars, but it's not really written into enough to be a classic. Watch Kramer vs Kramer for this film done well. This is not it.",4,24,53,9 December 2019
