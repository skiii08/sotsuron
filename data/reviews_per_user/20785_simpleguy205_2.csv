Angels & Demons," literally unbelievable
","firstly,i would like to say that the performance by tom hanks in this film is quite ordinary,as we all know what he capable of(see cast away) .the film from start to end is quite unbelievable and that too literally.its full of coincidences it would become difficult to accept even for an ordinary sane person.its funny that they have shown that saving the vatican depends entirely upon mr.tom hanks.and that too he is like almost on his own wid a few ( 4-7 max)police officers wid him. could anyone believe that only mr.langdon in the entire world is capable of saving the vatican and shockingly he is it seems. and the things that mr.langdon speaks through-out is so 'out of this world' that i thought that even people from vatican wont understand any. i got fed-up of the fim after an hour.the film is quite amusing in the sense that none of the characters actually care what happens to vatican except for tom(at least it seems that way).they r in no hurry to do anything. and that too after getting a threat that the vatican will be blown within next 24 hours.its OK to watch for any tom hanks fan(one who is ready to accept that mr.tom hanks is a old super-hero )",2,5,11,10 August 2009
The Machinist," awful is an understatement
","the makers have just borrowed the concept of fightclub,change the actors,and remade it. OK,bale had lost a lot weight for the film,i agree. i felt as if the were trying to hammer that fact into my head and telling me 'u better like it'.that was an clear attempt to get an Oscar and has little to do wid the script.u wont believe in how many scenes bale shows off his skinny physique . at the end u realize that everything that was shown in last 90 minutes was just an imagination and was not happening in real.if anybodies seen fightclub movie ,don't watch this one. i knew from the weirdness of the scenes,that there would be a stupid explanation for all this crap at the end. yes,it is shown that it was just an imagination.y didn't the makers just imagined that they had made the film? y did they have to make this film in real. don't watch it and have pity have your soul",1,7,16,1 August 2009
