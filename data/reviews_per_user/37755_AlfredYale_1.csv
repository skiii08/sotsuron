The New World," Shame it was so close to greatness... Accent Irony
","First, of all I love this movie and am equally frustrated by it. This is the only movie I've ever felt was so close to being great but failed by just a few errors. LENGTH: You already know about the length -- just a little editing would have gone a long way, but I happen to like long movies.ACCENT: The irony that makes watching the DVD bug me is how a director insisted on forcing a Native American to speak English perfectly after only a few years. Why? The languages couldn't have been more different! You'd think someone on the set would have spoken-up -- pun intended -- and reminded him that since lots of the key crew had foreign accents -- and probably spoke English for decades -- then, perhaps Pocahontas would have one too. MAKE-UP: If the make-up department could have stepped in during the last part of the movie to actually age the characters, it would have prevented me from jolting out to the story to realize how young a now aged Pocahontas looked. MUSIC: I love Mozart, however his music didn't fit in with many scenes, especially the dance scene. A little more authentic Native American music -- especially during said dance scene -- would have gone such a long way.He was just so close to creating a true masterpiece that it's a crying shame a few errors prevented him from reaching that goal.",7,0,2,10 January 2007
