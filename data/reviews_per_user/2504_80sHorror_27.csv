It," A Classic!!! fore years to com. like Michael,Freddy,Jason and Letherface
","The town of Derry in 1989 is terrorised by a demon disguised as a clown until a group of kids decide to fight back. Remake of the 1990 TV mini series. One of the best Stephen King adaptations, coming across like a coming of age drama meets monster movie with excellent performances from the kids and a terrifying excellent performance from Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, one of horror cinema's all time great monsters who in time i can imagine being as well remembered as the likes of Robert Englund as Freddy Kreuger. Dark, creepy, tense and macabre with some humour in places and feeling like a cross between Stand By Me, an 80's Stephen King adaptation, The Goonies, Nightmare On Elm Street, Super 8 and TV series Stranger Things and faithful to the mini series without copying it. This is only part 1 or chapter 1 with part 2 to follow. Up there with the all time great horror movies. Do not watch if you don't like clowns.",10,4,9,20 September 2017
Hereditary," A new horror classic, tense and terrifying
","I've spent my whole life watching horror movies yet there were parts of this movie that left me in utter shock and horror, left me gasping and hoping they wouldn't go where they did. I can't praise this movie enough.. brutal, crafty, original, eerie, compelling.. just brilliant and utterly disturbing and terrifying. I can't say enough good things.",Null,1,3,4 November 2018
Train to Busan," Bloody' awesome! # 1 zombie movie , must see
","The best zombie film I've seen in a long time. With its ultra fast piling over each other infected undead it is more in the style of World War Z than TV's The Walking Dead and also does not have the latter's extreme gore. There is enough blood and violence so it is not too light for a hardened zombie fan but focuses more on tension and action. It also managed to build up the characters so I cared about them and once that happens the tension stakes are that much higher. The main characters are a business man and his young daughter on a train when a zombie apocalypse begins. Death while infected causes people to instantly turn so one infected girl on the train causes the infection to spread like wildfire and very soon two groups of survivors remain, separated by infected carriages. Edge of the seat tension and many action set pieces follow as the smaller group tries to get to the front of the train and things escalate in all sorts of ways with some unexpected turns, big action, all building to a powerful climax. I loved it and was gripped from start to finish, I'm a big zombie fan and it did not disappoint. It's serious in tone and has some great character drama with some decent arcs and things play out in ways that have just a slight spin against Western expectations. The zombies are really well done, not too heavily made up (they're fresh) but they move well, all twitchy and sometimes freaky spasms, very fast and lethal. It is Korean language with subtitles but is not dialogue heavy. The DVD also includes behind the scenes footage and 2 trailers for the director's forthcoming Seoul Station which is a cartoon that appears part of this same undead world.",10,2,7,5 February 2017
Captain Marvel," Ale the bad revies are from trolls!! - the moste of them are fake
","That's the biggest question i got after seeing the 5.6 rating (per 6th march). When i read the reviews, some of them are nonsense. They just gave a low score and they didn't review anything in it and didn't explain well about their reasons. I thought maybe some of them are the fanbase of another studio hehehe...For me, this movie is great. It was a fun movie with good comedy and great storyline. Well the character development isn't really good, but the storyline is quite refreshing. I like the change of who is the real villain and the change of motive in this film. Sure it's not the first movie that tells story like that but it's nice they tried that way.And this movie is the prequel to introduce Capt Marvel to the MCU before End Game, so what you expect the storyline from that? I read the imdb user's review and they said that the storyline is standard and not like they expected, so i ask what you expect from the movie that purpose only to introduce a new character for the universe and End Game. For me, it's perfect for this film to introduce Capt Marvel.",10,19,52,8 March 2019
Shaun of the Dead," A Classic - Absolutely brilliant!,
","Shaun of the Dead is a great film, no questions asked! Its very funny and has great HORROR,a great story and has some excellent acting! The first thing i like about this film is how amazingly funny it is! Although this film may not be that amazing to people who haven't watched any of George A Romero's zombie films as most of the jokes in this film are 'spoofy'. But even if you didn't find this film funny it would still be a great movie, not all great films are comedies! The second thing i like about this film is the acting. Almost everyone who has an acting part in this film has played parts in BBC/ITV dramas or comedies (Casualty and programmes like that)! And in Shaun of the Dead they really do their job well! The films set in the 'rough areas' of a 'rough area' of England so their are no American actors putting on a stupid English accent and all the actors play their parts very realistically, especially Ed (Shaun's best friend)! The story is great in Shaun of the Dead, its very clever the way they seem to place Shaun and 'the gang' in the same situations as the characters off George Romeros films and slip in little jokes! You might of watched the film many times before you notice some of these little hidden grenades of laughter! And if your a fan of zombie films (which you must be really if you want to get the best 'Shaun of the Dead experience') then there is also some violent scenes too! So overall this isn't just great film its incredible, funny, smart and probably the best film of 2004! If you haven't seen this film then don't just watch it but buy it, and buy Dawn of the Dead (make shore its the 1970s version) and watch that before watching Shaun of the Dead. This will help you to understand all the jokes! (This is also a pretty good DVD, there are loads of extras for a single disc edition)",10,2,5,19 November 2011
The Babadook," A haunting, disturbing and brilliant tale!
","There is this deliciously scary book 'Mister Babadook', which is full off simple yet terrifying images and which ends up (unexplainably) in the hands of a shouty and slightly psychotic 6 year old.This is a terrifying, stylish, beautifully acted (both Essie Davies and Noah Wiseman are excellent as mother and son in a broken family) and quite original film. So scary that I spent half of it hidden under the duvet. This is an atmospheric eerie psychological thriller which plays with your mind and brain, never really showing the true 'face of evil', and that's what's impressive about it (or maybe I just missed it, busy looking away!).",10,10,22,21 February 2015
Us," Boring nonsense !! - i dont get the score of 7.5!!
","I was suckered into watching this movie because of the rave reviews, and other than a few creepy scenes this movies fails as an horror film. The plot starts off alright but quickly becomes a confusing mess with many holes and makes zero logical sense. I was never excited or tense while watching this, it was really even somewhat boring. The film has no real atmosphere other than about three total scenes that where somewhat unnerving. The acting was fine I guess, but this movie is not a great horror film, and I believe it is very overrated. The movie could have been better if the ending nonsense was left out, it's really bad.",1,27,42,29 March 2019
The Adventures of Tintin," Very entertaining film
","Tintin is a young European journalist who also solves crimes. After buying a model ship, he becomes involved in a mystery about a pirate treasure and finds his life is in danger.I loved this movie. The motion capture technique is fascinating and so well-done. Some characters look cartoonish while others look very real; the scenery is strikingly beautiful. The action-packed story is part pirate swashbuckler and part Indiana Jones adventure; the combination makes for a spectacular, witty, and exciting film with a sweet, smart, and very likable young man at its center.Highly recommended, especially for adults, and you don't have to be familiar with the graphic novel source material to enjoy it.",10,1,2,14 March 2012
Interstellar," ABSOLUTE Over-hyped TOSH
",AM I THE ONLY ONE ON PLANET EARTH WHO THINKS THAT THIS FILM IS ABSOLUTE TOSH? Perhaps I'm being unkind because I could only handle an hour before walking out. I thought the acting in particular was very poor. The storyline is twaddle - a farmer with flight experience finds NASA in an unspecified location with a rocket that is going to save Earth - a typecast Michael Caine (thank goodness it wasn't Morgan Freeman) opens the boardroom door and there is the rocket!. It seemed to me that used actual rocket launch footage? The time element is misused and the special effects are not that great. I thought Elysium knocked socks off this film. I did semi enjoy the water sequence but it was at the point where they get back to the mother ship that I walked ................ very quickly out of the cinema. Ps I love Matthew McConaughey in true detective and I can't believe I was looking at the same actor,1,31,66,21 February 2015
Nightcrawler," See It, You Will Thank Me
","I've said it before and I'll say it again, Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the most talented and reliable actors alive today. He's blown me away in more movies than I can name (some of my favorites being 'Donnie Darko', 'Prisoners', and 'Enemy') and his latest role as the sleazy crime reporter Lou Bloom even further proves his genius. He manages to up his first-class standard of acting and single-handedly carry this thrill ride of a film. 'Nightcrawler' is one of those movies that comes out of nowhere and astonishes you, proving that Hollywood can still widely release great films. It's a game-changer, and an entertaining one at that.The film centers around Bloom, a driven young guy living in Los Angeles that never quite operates on everyone's level. Desperate for work and looking for something to occupy his time, he comes across the fast paced world of crime journalism. Quickly forcing his way into the business and filming anything the news stations will buy, he begins to tow the line between observer and participant, all for his own favor. The more dangerous it is to capture, the more money he receives. And as you can expect, things get out of hand (much to the pleasure of the audience).It moves at an insanely rapid pace from one incident to the next and is one of the most captivating films I've seen in a long time. I never stopped to check the time once, which certainly says something, and was mesmerized by the mannerisms and dialogue coming from this peculiar character. Everything about this movie enchanted me: the darkly comic moments, dedicated performances, and dynamite writing. Add all that up and you have one of my favorite films of the year. See it, you will thank me.",10,0,0,21 February 2015
Split," Over hyped and mediocre film!!
","I didn't think it was all that good, its one of those films that gets over hyped and in the end turns out quite mediocre and boring, yes its funny in parts but you won't be rushing to see it again! Personally, I thought the acting was incredible and I loved the character development. What I didn't like was the portrayal of multiple personality disorder. It went from a very interesting story to a mediocre silly ending where he turns into a monster and starts killing people and starts doing supernatural things. That ruined it for me personally. M Night shyamlans direction was horrible towards the end. So far his best film will only be the sixth sense.",1,180,445,5 February 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," If you are 6 and like pokemon this is your movie!!! Boring!
","boring and overly complicated with absolutely no character development...extremely disappointed. What a load of tosh. Don't want to spoil but they used one character as an exposition device all the way through and then sacked off at the end like it was nothing. Meh acting, less than exciting story. Bloody awful lot. Just cashing in on the Harry Potter name .just really boring.For a while it is exactly what movies are supposed to be ... entertaining! I liked the unusual animals but the magic imagery is a poor copy of the HP imagery. After a while the beasts and animals are just more HP type animals. Unlike HP story lines which always had stories within stories within stories this is shallow by comparison.",1,3,10,5 March 2017
The Conjuring 2," A good sequel! Highly recommended!
","Wow!! Just wow!! James Wan is fast becoming by top horror director of all time. So far the Insidious franchise has put my faith back in actual scary horror movies and not the awful horror violence movies such as Rob Zombies god awful Halloween 2 where there is nothing scary whatsoever seeing someone stabbed 13 times. But with Dead Silence, Insidious and now The Conjuring, James Wan has made and produced some classic horrors. With the first Conjuring, I thought it was excellent up to the kind of rip-off ending where it reminded me far too much of The Exorcist. That was my only gripe with the film though.In The Conjuring 2 however, yes we have another possession but it is the three 'demons' that Wan has added to this movie which just terrifies you. It was bad enough having nightmares about Red Faced Demon and The Bride in Black from Insidious. Now we have Bill Wilkins (The Old Man), The Nun and The Crooked Man. All three of these played on my fears that I had as a kid and they were truly terrifying. Like with Annabelle who was introduced in The Conjuring and got her own spin off film, the same will now happen with The Nun in this film and I for one can't wait. A special mention must go to the production design as well because the house that the family live in in this movie would be terrifying WITHOUT all the haunting's going on!! Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren are even better in this than the first one and are a great on screen couple with quite a nice scene at the end dancing to an Elvis Presley track.",10,0,2,5 March 2017
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Not enough publicity for such a great film!,
","I can't believe that such an amazing film had so little publicity or distribution - I am so excited that it will finally be released! As an avid horror fan, I had no expectations for Tucker and Dale. I basically watch anything and everything, and seeing as this was low-budget with very little publicity, I underestimated this. It has since become one of my favourite movies ever. Alan Tudyk is fantastic as always, and I had never seen Tyler Labine before but he basically steals the show. While the films it's ripping are pretty foul, T+D still manages to have a lot of heart, and Labine's character is so adorable! This does for The Hills Have Eyes what Shaun did for Dawn Of The Dead, while kicking Zombieland in the privates. Unmissable. This film has instant cult classic written all over it as the standard hillbilly survival horror is turned on its head. Two lovable bumpkins have to fight for their lives when a set of misguided teens think the well meaning duo are out to kill them in Texas Chainsaw / Deliverance style. You can't help but root for the hapless pair but also groan in enjoyable frustration as the teens start to drop dead in lots of extremely gory accidents. A total joy from start to finish.",10,52,55,19 November 2011
It Follows," Original and creepy
","This movie does have an awful lot of hype around it, the only way to enjoy this movie is don't jump in thinking its going to be a masterpiece, its not but it still is a fantastic movie for many reasons, its certainly very original, the story is basically about a girl who is currently dating a guy, they go out one night and have sex in the back of his car, he tells her he has passed something to her, something that will follow her, the only way to survive is to pass it to another person, then the terror begins!! you need to go into this movie with a very good imagination, I think most people only rate this low because they don't get it, the movie does leave many things open to explanation which is good, you have to fill in the blanks which makes it more fun, the movie has a good pace and gets more and more tense as it unfolds, the movie is directed really well with some nice quiet suburban locations, its certainly good at the scares and the feeling of sheer dread when the followers are on screen, the movie is very grounded and has little use for cheesy effects which is great, the cast is talented, all the female leads are great young actresses, the movies main star for me is the awesome music score by composer disasterpeace, the music really helps give such a feeling of fear, much like John Carpenters theme did for Halloween, the movie like people have said feels like a long middle, you don't get an explanation of where the supernatural element comes from and the ending is left very open to explanation too but you just have to use your imagination, the movie is certainly worth checking out if your a horror fan, its really well made, its not amazing so don't hype yourself up, its clever and original at least and will probably certainly be a future classic indeed",10,5,21,2 August 2015
Gone Girl," Very poor plot - full of logical flaws and over-hyped!!
","This really is a very poor plot indeed - but it would be unfair to list the many logical flaws here and so spill the story. But you can look up other websites for the synopsis if you want to discover what I mean. In summary though not only does the plot defy all reasonable logic and expectations of a true police investigation, but it's as if the author gets so far and doesn't know how to end the story and after dragging it one for nearly 2 1/2 hours panics and ends it all abruptly very unsatisfactorily. The characterisation suddenly implodes at the end and the main character played by Ben Affleck who has been stable and consistent the rest of the movie within the last 5 minutes suddenly changes 360 degrees to become a completely different character, which again makes no sense. It really is a waste of time and money to buy this DVD. I believe 90% of anyone who buys this DVD would not also be disappointed with their purchase after viewing.",1,5,7,21 February 2015
Insidious," This will be a classic like Poltergeist!!
","I couldn't wait to see this film, and I wasn't disappointed. I thought it was brilliant. I have watched it twice now, and I can't tire of it. It is an intriguing story, and well acted by all. I couldn't help but compare it though, to an updated version of the Steven Spielberg film, 'Poltergiest' Really really enjoyed this one. Well worth the money, and a watch in a darkened room! From James Wan, the director of the original and best Saw movie, this is an excellent very creepy movie about a young couple who think their new home is haunted. But they realize as they move house and the ghost follows them to their next home that it's not the house that's haunted. A very well acted film, Patrick Wilson from Watchmen and X Men First Class and Damages star Rose Byrne are both very good as the young couple, this has elements of both Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity though without the camera. This film proves that you don't need to have lots of blood guts and gore to make a good horror film though if you're one of those people that love lots of blood guts and gore then you will probably hate this movie as there is hardly any. Tension builds right from the start all the way through to the finish. Excellent.",10,0,0,11 March 2012
Saw," What a surprising film. At last, a fresh, original horror film that is a CLASSIC!
","SAW is one of my favorite films of 2005 and has an absolutely great story which goes well with some decent acting (although the acting can be pretty bad at times). As i was saying earlier probably the main reason i likr this film so much is because of it's amazing story. The other thing you have to watch in this film is the ending which is one of the best a horror film has ever has, i wont tell you what happens besause it will spoil it but it really will stick with you! This film isn't really violent but very sadistic at times. The killer in this film doesn't really kill people, he tests them and finds ways of making them kill them-selves because he doesn't like the way people live their lives, he thinks the gift of life isn't something you should waste! (or in short he is completely and totally mad!) This is a great film that any horror fan with a PSP should get!",10,0,3,21 February 2015
Sinister," Extremely scary and creepy piece of supernatural horror film
","Finally a horror film that packs some quality and delivers on the hype.Sinister is a very unsettling, disturbing and scary film.This film successfully mixes the POV 'Found Footage' style horror with the traditional narrative. Fans of the found footage genre will enjoy this but more importantly those who aren't fans of the genre might find this style works better for them as it blends both styles effectively.From the very opening shot you know this film is going to be a ride. I found certain sequences in the movie extremely disturbing (in a good way) and some images were burned onto my subconscious memory long after the film had finished. This is a true horror film in the sense that there are a few jump scares but it does not rely on them which is refreshing and it is not a total gore-fest. It balances the two very well and delivers a very tense atmosphere with some harrowing images.Ethan Hawke is great and carries the film confidently as he delivers a very convincing performance. I happily watched him for the entire duration of the film and didn't find myself taken out of the film due to bad acting, which is rare in a horror film.I regard myself as a very hardened horror viewer and I am not easily scared... When I got home after the cinema, I was spooked. I found myself closing my blinds and turning on all the lights.Not a particularly pleasant viewing, Sinister accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do.Good, solid horror film.",10,4,7,3 November 2012
Don't Breathe," Love it! The best horror film of 2016 - A classic!!
","This is certainly one fantastic thriller, a very original home invasion movie that's very tense and lots of fun and gripping throughout its running time, this movie is described in some reviews as a horror film but its really not, its horrific maybe as a thriller but not a straight up horror, there's no supernatural elements here. The movie is also described as having the best twist in years but that's overhyping just a tad I think as there is not so much a twist that makes you say wow I didn't see that coming its just a twisted story, none the less its a very well directed movie, very nice looking sets and locations, very well acted by a great cast and a tense soundtrack, if you like scares and jumps and nail-biting movies this is certainly for you, its not blood and guts. A must see thriller that's very well made and wont be forgotten for a while.",10,1,8,5 February 2017
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Visually stunning!! a classic
","Francis Ford Coppala's approach is unlike Bram Stoker's famous book, not horror, but more an approach to the Love-side of the story. There still is a lot of horror in the film that really frightens you, but the story is more centerd around the tragic lovelife of count Dracula. Also, another thing that makes this movie a really fascinating movie experience, is because of some erotic scenes. They make the scenes extremely powerful which really helps to power the emotion and the horror. It also makes it the most erotic Dracula film ever.The movie is made with beautiful sets and colour. There is a real colour theme going on in the movie that is truly maqnificent and which pleases the eye. The use of music and sound is also fantastically done. It makes it more frightening and exciting. The casting of this masterpiece is absolutely perfect. Gary Oldman plays the count Dracula with true emotion and lust. He steals the show. Also, Winona Ryder as the lovely Mina does a fantastic job. With further rolls of Anthony Hopkins as the professor Van Hesling,(who plays him with lots of joy and wickedness. He is the one who brings some humor into the dark world the movie is in), Keanu Reaves as Jonathan (A great choice for the part), and Sadie Frost as Lucy (Who really acts great! She made quite an impression on me because she played Lucy perfectly) makes this a wonderful movie experience.So are you in for a night of Horror, Erotica, Love, Action, great special effects and a lot of Vampire teeth? Than 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is the movie for you to see. This movie will truly amaze you from beginning to end. When the credits role over the screen, you do understand the tagline of the movie: Love Never Dies. Worth viewing many times!",10,16,24,1 May 2012
Kong: Skull Island," Classic monster movie!!
","Kong: Skull Island is a 2017 American monster film; let's be clear this isn't Shakespeare and unlike the dreadful 2014 Godzilla the film doesn't take itself too seriously. The film has the feel of a classic 90s Blockbuster; now depending on your view of 90s Blockbusters this is either a good thing or a bad thing. The film is a rip roaring, funny and fast paced monster movie where the monster gets the same amount of screen time as the rest of the cast. Although this is the cast; Tom Hiddleston as James Conrad, Samuel L. Jackson as Preston Packard, John Goodman as William 'Bill' Randa, Brie Larson as Mason Weaver, Jing Tian as San Lin, Toby Kebbell as Jack Chapman, John Ortiz as Victor Nieves, Corey Hawkins as Houston Brooks, Jason Mitchell as Glenn Mills, Shea Whigham as Earl Cole, Thomas Mann as Reg Slivko, Eugene Cordero as Reles and John C. Reilly as Hank Marlow. 13 main cast members all vying for 118 minutes worth of screen time.",10,24,50,11 March 2017
The Conjuring," Effective and creepy
","The purpose of this sort of film is to set goose bumps along your arms and make you jump and to that end the director has done a damned good job. My wife and I jumped several times during the movie even though we knew something was about to happen and numerous times I had chills running down my arms. This is of course all down to the effective use of music and sound effects together with the images, without them you probably wouldn't react because there is nothing here that you haven't seen before. It is just very well combined and presented. The story is the classic haunted house tale of a new family being tormented by an evil entity and the good guys that come to the rescue and is allegedly based on a true story. I noticed that some reviewers have referred to an interview with one of the daughters of the family but to counterbalance that the current owners of the house say it is all baloney and nothing has or does happen there. But there again they would say that wouldn't they? This is a great movie to give yourself and some friends a thrill at Halloween and there is no blood and gore which is a plus but don't watch it on your own if you are of a nervous disposition.",10,0,0,21 February 2015
Scream," The slasher film that started it all (again) CLASSIC!!
","The 'slasher' film, i.e. a killer stalking a selection of dippy American teenagers, had kind of gone out of fashion in the late eighties. Therefore, the early nineties were a barren place for masked nutjobs wielding knives. Then Scream came along.It's about a young girl, seemingly destined to spend the entire film being stalked by a masked killer who despatches her peers in many different knife-related ways. Nothing particularly unusual there, but don't let the basic nature of the plot put you off. There is definitely more to this than meets the eye.It not only revitalised the 'slasher genre' but it also was the first of such films to poke fun at the whole genre in itself. If you've ever found yourself yelling at the 'dumb blonde' on the screen to run the right way and not straight back into the serial killer's clutches then this is the film for you. It uses the horror clichés to the max and takes great pleasure in, not only pointing them out, but dispelling them.However, Scream wasn't just hugely successful because it poked fun at the genre. It was also a damn good mystery. With other similar films, the killer was normally quite obvious, i.e. the big disfigured bloke in a mask, wielding a chainsaw. But in Scream, pretty much every character is a suspect. The only time you can really rule them out is when they end up the wrong end of the killer's knife.If you love horror then you've probably already seen it. If you haven't... watch it now. The only downside you might find is that it was so successful that there were almost an infinite number of (nowhere near as good) copies. However, Scream is the original and BEST. It's fun, gory, well-written with great characters. What more could you want if you like scary movies?",10,1,2,21 February 2015
The Woman in Black," Super scary and super fun film!
","occasional hints of the terror that is yet to come. There's no gore or cheap tricks, just scares in the best tradition of traditional ghost stories. In one scene a shot of an open door manages to cause hairs on the back of the neck to stand up. The story harks back to the M.R. James ghost stories with a well meaning man unleashing a malevolent force, in this case the Woman In Black herself.This is one of the creepiest, spookiest ghost stories ever filmed. Adapted from Susan Hill's book of the same title, the tale centres around a young lawyer sent to settle the estate of a deceased old lady. At the funeral, he sees what he thinks is another mourner, a woman dressed all in black. When he mentions this to others however, he gets a strange reaction and quickly realises all is not as it seems. Whenever this woman appears, so local legend says, a child will die. From then on, things become more and more tense as he becomes haunted by this mysterious woman. This production uses no special effects or fancy sets and to be honest, I think it would have detracted from the film if there had been. Instead, the viewer is left to concentrate purely on the story which becomes increasingly tense as it develops. There are several moments that will make you jump or send a shiver through you. Watch it alone with the lights off if you dare!",10,14,24,28 February 2012
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A masterpiece of americanized fear
","A classic that will have a long line of descendants. All the necessary elements are there to make a blockbusting horror film, a phenomenal scary movie. It concerns teenagers that are definitely in between desire and sex, both creating and nourishing in them fear and insecurity. The main characters are girls who are even more insecure and more fragile in their sexual fantasms and fears. Then the film systematically blurs the limits between reality and dream, reality and nightmare. It is one fundamental human fear that has been with humanity since the first homo sapiens ever appeared on this earth : the fear that what you imagine or just plain see in your mind may be just as real, even if virtual, as reality. Virtual reality is the other side of the living coin and it is so simple to toss it over. Then you get into smaller elements like underground airless and lightless corridors. Nerverending furnaces that leak and steam around. Snakes, bugs and other creepy crawly monsters. Then the film can center its focusing eye onto the essential element that is going to shine bright on the background of fearful and frightening people and objects. It is the four long razor sharp metallic claws or nails that this Fred Krueger wears on his right hand. This handful of claws, this handful of expanded and deadly nails is the ultimate fear in itself : the hand that can crush you, choke you, strangle you, seize you, grab you, etc. The claws that can tear, cut, scratch, perforate, and do so many other actions. Then you just have to add some blood, some metallic shine, some rust, and some sharp sound and the trap is ready and your soul can fall in the hole and it does at the bottom of a bathtub or in the middle of a bed. Then the film is a neverending story",10,4,5,21 February 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," And a new classic horror series is born!! This is what Scream did in the '90
","These are the days we remember why we love Lionsgate. After collecting years of dust (due to MGM's financial collapse), the mini-major is taking a pretty hefty risk with The Cabin in the Woods, Cloverfield writer Drew Goddard's directorial debut. It only adds to the flavor that Joss Whedon (of 'Buffy' fame) co-wrote the screenplay for the high-concept slasher that stars the newly minted Chris Hemsworth (Thor). The most difficult aspect of Cabin is how to sell the movie without giving anything away, I'm about to experience the same dilemma in writing this review While there is a pretty heavy turn of events, one of the film's twists (if you can even call it that) is revealed in the opening scene. Cabin begins in an office atmosphere with co-workers Steve Hadley (Richard Jenkins) and Richard Sitterson (Bradley Whitford) comically riffing on a project they're working on. It's the mysterious setup that'll engage the viewer until the big reveal. Simultaneously, the audience is introduced to the stereotypical 'teens' that are about to embark on a journey to check out a cabin in the woods, recently acquired by one of their uncles. The two stories eventually collide into a bloodbath of epic proportions.The strength of Cabin comes in the playful nature of the screenplay. Goddard and Whedon play everything tongue and cheek in a completely meta atmosphere. The two take loving jabs at the genre, making fun of the array of clichés horror fans are used to seeing, all without it coming off like a Scary Movie sequel. But the true magic happens in the full delivery of the promised 'slasher movie to end all slasher movies.' It's hard to elaborate without giving anything away, but it should be known that Cabin in the Woods will become an instant classic among genre fans. It's immediate. To say it's the Scream of the new decade is sort of a misnomer - seeing that people outside of horror may not 'get the joke' - but for those on the inside, expect a heartfelt and blood-soaked homage to all of the films we've grown up watching.Ultimately, Cabin is an extremely fun movie that's beyond satisfying, especially for those expecting some sort of bloodbath. And even though there's a pretty heavy amount of CGI, there's an equal amount of unbelievable practical effects. Tonally, it all makes sense when you see it.While Cabin in the Woods is a tough sell to the general public, we as horror fans can only pray it finds its footing. It's one of those 'gateway' movies that'll open the world of horror to an entire new generation of film buffs. There's something special about this slasher that hasn't been felt since Warner Bros. released Trick 'r Treat all those years back (and unlike Michael Dougherty's anthology, Cabin is blessed to have found a loving home.) While I wouldn't go as far as to call it a masterpiece, it's definitely the kind of project that will leave its mark, especially on younger viewers. And with Jason Voorhees nowhere to be seen (again), it's the perfect movie to check out on Friday the 13th",10,15,40,4 April 2012
