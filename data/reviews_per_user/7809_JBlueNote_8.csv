The Avengers," 1 Must See Movie Down, Tons More To Go!!!
","Well, that movie was definitely as great and epic as everyone has been talking about. If the movie lacked in anything, it gained in its action. The only reason I kind of feel disappointed was that I thought there'd be more villains besides big and bad Loki and what ever he unleashed onto the Earth. Other than that, the movie was absolutely terrific. The heroes did seem to play like their normal selves like they were in their separate movies. Tony Stark was still cocky and such a smartass (excuse my French or whatever), Thor still had that meathead mentality, old Cap'n was still always ready to help anyone in need, and the Hulk was....the Hulk. This version of the Hulk though humored me the most since he always had jokes about why he had to act so cautious. The only characters that you really get to fully know more about are Nick Fury, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, who was my favorite of course. The actor who played him sure knows how to be in the roles I just love. I did some research before the movie on who the original Avengers were and I kept thinking that this one lady who was basically Nick Fury's right hand 'woman' would be 'Wasp', but maybe that will be for a later sequel. Speaking of sequels, there sure will be one judging by the sneak peek I got to see in the middle of the credits. Sadly I left after that and didn't wait until the end of the credits like a true fan. I hope I didn't miss anything great. Ever since 'The Grey', I've always been staying after movies like these which you know would have some huge secret at the end of all the credits. All in all, this movie was just so beast. I totally recommend this movie a thousand times over, a million times over if you're a die hard Marvel fan. I'd give it a 9/10. Now for a month or so wait until the next big movie I want to see comes out: Dark Knight Rises. Oh man, I just can't wait to compare that movie with this.",9,1,4,4 May 2012
The Expendables 2," Nothing But the Big Stars Showin' Off
","The Expendables 2 was just as I expected it to be: guns blazin', straight out violence, bloody gore, and the big superstars showing off. The plot was simple and had some holes, but I guess the action outweighed any story that it had. The acting was kind of off for me. Some characters had some weird lines and were hard to follow, including some of the new ones. I guess I shouldn't complain when this movie is something that's kind of in the same ballpark of 'The Avengers' concept wise where you have the biggest and baddest action movie heroes of the past two decades battle tyranny. Probably the only thing I liked besides the full-out action might have been how Chris Hemsworth's brother, Liam Hemsworth, faired in this movie among the veteran cast. Didn't think that another actor besides the obvious ones in this movie could have stood out in this movie. There's nothing really much else to say but to just get ready for another action packed, gore filled movie that will have you ooing, ahhing, and laughing at some times after hearing some of the jokes that go from 'Really, you had to say that again,' to 'Oh wow, that was really funny.' I'd rate it a 6/10 and recommend it if you really want to see a real life version of 'The Avengers', except the superpowers are replaced with guns, tanks, planes, bombs, etc.!!!",6,4,11,19 August 2012
Ted," A Man's 'Bear' Friend
","I haven't really watched Seth Macfarlane's Family Guy that much, but I knew this movie would be just as funny. Going in, I was thinking it would be some average version of a movie like a boy/man with his dog (where this time it's with his teddy bear), but once I heard the first opening joke in this movie, I was definitely hooked. After that, the jokes kept coming and I almost got to the point of tears, especially with one later in the movie. Some of them you felt OK laughing about, while some made you feel so guilty that you laughed so loudly after hearing them.I finally got to see how the great Mila Kunis acted and it's funny seeing Markie Mark talk with his New Yawk-like accent like he did in the movie 'Fighter'. It was awesome how it was basically Peter Griffin if he were a teddy bear. Even though he had a small part, Ralph Garman from the podcast 'Hollywood Babble-On' did great as Johnny's father when Johnny was little. It kind of felt odd seeing Ryan Reynolds in this, but his part was just as funny as everyone else's. Even though the plot kind of felt basic, the jokes were the main part of it. You kind of had that feeling of knowing what was going to happen next, but the stuff Johnny and his 'bear' friend (ba dumb tssh) are just so great you have to see it. I'll never look at toy teddy bears the same and also these pandas that I'm seeing on a local news station. I'd definitely recommend this movie if you're in for a very good laugh. I'd rate it a 7.5/10.",7,1,4,5 July 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Truly 'Amazing' Reboot
","Let's see if I can use the adjective in this movie's title until the very end of this review. Well that movie was just....phenomenal. I really enjoyed this one and to be honest going in, I didn't think I was going to from what I saw from its previews. The story, I felt, was closer to the comics than the other 3 previous movies were, and I barely read them. Andrew Garfield did an excellent job as Peter Parker/Spiderman. I'm still undecided on if he did a better job than Tobey Maguire, but he was about just as good. Emma Stone did awesome as Gwen Stacy and still had me having, and probably many others, the biggest crush for her. The only flaws I kind of had with it was that instead of using the webbers from his own hands like in the comics, this version of Spider-Man had to use these techno-gadget like ones that I'm still confused on how they worked exactly. I also did kind of feel like there would be more fights between the main villain and the protagonist, but I somehow it still fulfilled me. Of course the ending was a cliffhanger, and like the Marvel movies nowadays, there were clues to the upcoming sequel (if there will be one). I'd definitely recommend this movie if you're ready for a new type Spider-Man. Just like I said about going in not having high expectations for this movie, I felt really 'amazed' leaving this movie. If I were to rate it, I'd give it a 7.8/10.",8,2,5,3 July 2012
Brave," Pixar Still Amazes Me
","Unlike my mom, I enjoyed this Disney Pixar movie just like I have the others. It kind of felt like a movie for all ages since it was set in two layers, one part being for the kids, and the other part (being the morale of the story) for those who are older. Going in I thought it was going to be about the girl trapped in a forest or something finally facing her fear, but it was something kind of the same, and a little different. I do agree with what my mom said about its short length, but I liked it. I was amazed that there were still a lot of people, mostly families with their little kids, that came to see it. I almost couldn't find a seat. Perhaps they decided to go see this movie to beat the insane, 100+, record breaking heat that was awaiting us outside. I'd recommend it though if you're a Pixar fan or just want to see some movie that I guess would 'touch at the heart strings'. I'd rate it a 6.8/10.",7,0,0,6 July 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," Kathryn Bigelow Does It Again
","Kathryn Bigelow has done it again for me with her film 'Zero Dark Thirty'. It may have taken awhile to get to some of her scenes that almost make you too scared to see what's behind a corner, but those scenes were as equally exciting as they were in 'The Hurt Locker'. Going in to this film, I actually had something to compare this to besides what I and the whole world heard and what the U.S. government allowed us to see. Yesterday, I saw 'Seal Team Six: The Raid On Osama Bin Laden', and I definitely could tell the difference from that movie, or some film made for TV, to this one. That movie obviously wasn't as intense as this one was, but it at least gave you an idea of what the soldiers went through to get ready for their big mission. I felt that the main focus was on the main character played by Jessica Chastain. In the beginning of the movie, you see how she seemed so innocent and new to the task she was assigned to, but as the movie progressed, you see her become more and more obsessed with reaching the goal of this task, even if it meant her life or the lives of others. It kind of amazes you when you see the things the CIA did to finally reach 5/1/11.Once the movie gets to the point where the dream team comes in, you notice how it automatically focuses on them a little and gets straight to the action. Once the big objective commenced, it was as if you were transported into the room where Obama, Biden, Hillary, and many others were while watching a masterpiece play before your very eyes. I'm glad that I saw this movie since I got to see a depiction of this event that I doubt our government would ever release to us. The movie does give you that sees of doubt regarding some things and makes you come up with your own solutions, but even if the #1 target in that compound wasn't him, seeing the carrying out of that objective was thrilling and epic at the same time. I think I probably held my breath a lot during it. Besides that scene, there were some other scenes that made me hold my breath since you could feel that something was a little off during them.Overall, it's definitely a movie to see, but I don't think it was material for Best Picture. I really enjoyed it as much as I did Django Unchained, but I believe Django's nomination for Best Picture was right. Maybe my mom was right and that it got nominated solely on the subject and how authentic Bigelow made it. I got to give it to whoever designed the Bin Laden compound since it looked as so real you'd think that they were actually filming the movie in it. But still, I just don't see it making Best Picture. If it somehow manages to get that title, I'll be shocked. Overall, I'd rate this movie an 8.4/10 and would recommend seeing it if you want to see how we 'got' Osama Bin Laden.",8,7,19,11 January 2013
Prometheus," To Prequel Or Not To Prequel?
","This movie met all of my expectations. It may have even surpassed them. Even after all these years between the movies, Ridley Scott has not disappointed me. What an amazing movie this was that I just saw, and what an amazing cast this was. The girl who played in the original 'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo', Noomi Rapace, absolutely shined in this movie playing as one of the explorers of this foreign moon that she and many others embark on. Charlize Theron playing the commander of Prometheus seemed to act in the same kind of cruel, fierce role as I saw her act last weekend in 'Snow White and the Huntsman'. Idris Elba, who played as the captain of Prometheus, was great, too in this and seemed to act the same as he did in 'Takers' without the British accent. The sole survivor from the movie 'Devil' who played as another explorer did wonderful, too. And last but not least, the actor Michael Fassbender, who mostly everyone remembers acting phenomenal as Magneto in 'X-Men: First Class' did just that as the ever-so-too- smart-for-himself android of the bunch.The movie seemed to follow the same plot as 'Alien' where they explore a cave and leave with something unknown that changes everything. Like the first, Ridley Scott again shows how we are so mesmerized by things we have never seen, not giving into account of what dangerous things it could be capable of. Unlike the original movie, there was obviously more to it. It actually didn't feel like a prequel until the very end of the movie that I wish not to spoil. The visual effects were definitely something to see, especially it you're fortunate enough to see it in IMAX 3D like I did. It was set in the year of 2093 (which if I am alive by then, I'll be 100 years old) and definitely like what we think that year might be like. Holograms were everywhere and most of the controls were touch screen, just like how the smartphones of today are. If you didn't think this movie was a prequel to Alien going into it, your mindset could have changed at the revealing of the title since it was just the same as it was in Alien where at first it looks like symbols but then forms into letters. I definitely recommend this movie whether you've seen the other Alien movies or not. The ending may even make you want you buy or rent those movies at a store or check them out on Netflix, and I'd recommend those, too. If I were to rate this movie, it would be given an 8.5/10. With this movie finished, the next big movie that I'm really anticipating is the last Batman movie, 'Dark Knight Rises'. There is the other Spiderman movie, but I think this movie I just saw, and Batman will be of the greatest movies I've seen this year.",8,6,12,8 June 2012
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Made me hungry for more
","Just got out of the theater an hour or so ago from seeing this movie. Last night (thanks to Netflix), I started what seems like a tradition of watching a movie trilogy's first movie and watching the new sequel the night after. With it and the books (somewhat) fresh in my mind, I was ready for how this one would play out, and I was thoroughly enjoyed. From my memory, I think that the movie actually did about everything that happened in book from chapter to chapter. Usually with these movie/book type of franchises, you sometime see big, crucial parts from the book not in the film, but that wasn't the case for this film.The plot was pretty easy to follow, and felt pretty much the same from the first movie, but this time, the fake aspect to it that the two main characters had to put on in the first wasn't as prevalent as in this one. To be honest, that part almost killed the first one for me even though it was essential to the plot. Thankfully it didn't get to the confusing levels of Twilight. The violence, being part that actually got me into this whole franchise, really kept me in more in this one than in the first. It felt a bit more gritter with more violent and smart ways of killings than that which was seen in the first. It did feel that it sped through the first half again, but it definitely slowed down for the whole reason people were watching it for. I went with a friend who actually wasn't as pleased from this as I was since they felt it didn't focus on the new opponents as much as they kind of did in the first movie. For me, it felt as if they kind of went over them in about the same, quick manner.The acting was great, but of course there were some funny bits thanks to some characters' ways of acting. It was great to see how Phillip Seymour Hoffman played as the new game maker. For some reason, the funny delivery of his line, 'I'm going to hurt her,' from Mission Impossible III kept playing in my mind during the whole movie, which made some serious parts a little funny. Jennifer Lawrence shined again as Katniss, acting at about the same level, if not higher, as she did in the first. It really felt like this for the rest of the characters, with a slight bump. The new characters were great, and of course my favorite was Johanna played by Jena Malone. She was the kind of character that shocked you at first and really made you wonder where her alliance was after.If I were to rate this movie in terms of decimals, I'd give it an 8.3/10. In my view, it was better than the first, and if you read the books, it's a must see. Can't wait for Mockingjay, which I hear will be a two-parter.",8,2,19,23 November 2013
