Insidious: Chapter 2," It Will Take What You Love Most
","Insidious 1 was an amazing movie. It set a high bar for Insidious Chapter 2. The sequel is one of those rare movies better than its proceeder. This movie picks off right from where the first one ended. Instead of focusing solely on the Lamberts though, it brings in a mythological tale about 'The Bride In Black.' It also ventures into The Further, so those who thought The Further ruined the first Insidious, won't like the sequel. But it shows anything can happen in the Further. Though this one isn't as scary as the first one, the plot was a lot better with many plot twist that made this film to never get boring. But there still are the old jump scares from the first one. Their is also nice camera work, as Wan proves himself good with the camera. All in all, this movie was spectacular. Watch it like right now!",10,1,4,15 September 2013
World War Z," Below Average Zombie Film
","I don't understand why so many people like this film. Brad Pitt did an outstanding job but it was just like any other zombie movie but just not as good. Yeah the special effects are amazing. The graphics were good too. Aside from that though it's not that good. Plus, it isn't scary, yet it's considered a horror film. Maybe one or two jump scenes but it doesn't even have a scary build up or atmosphere. The plot was the same, if not worse, than any other zombie film. It's not your 2013 version of Night Of The Living Dead haha. But it is a good time killer, so if you're bored go see it! Just don't be disappointed when it's over and it doesn't live up to your expectations.",5,5,10,21 July 2013
Alien," You Can't Top Alien
","This is my favorite movie of all time. From the start, where Ridley and her crew wake up to the end where she blows up the ship it's pure brilliancy. This movie proves you don't need special effects to have a good horror/ SCI FY film. The chest-burster scene is just an unforgettable moment too. Who would think of an alien latching onto someone's face, then plant a seed in them? Then to make that alien die off and have the larva burst out of a man's chest. It's one of the best scenes in horror history. And it has a great build up, as the alien picks the humans off things get really tense. So if you're reading this review stop and go watch this movie. NOW! I promise you won't be disappointed.",10,0,1,22 July 2013
The Witch," Magically Brilliant
","Once a year, a horror movie is released that doesn't follow the original 'hot girl, jump scare' plot, and delves into a mind twisting story that slowly builds up until you're completely lost in awe. 2016's example of this is The Witch. What starts as a simple plot, a family getting excommunicated from the village in 1630's New England, turns into a tale of deception and family bonds being broken. One of my favorite things about the Witch was the dialogue; the entire movie uses Shakespearian-like dialogue that really draws viewers in. The acting itself is superb; there isn't a second that passes by where the actors aren't 110% in character. The film itself makes it evident that witchcraft will play a vital role in the plot, and while it does, the plot takes a turn and really builds itself upon the deteriorating family relationships. The setting of the film itself was beautifully haunting; shots of the forest surrounding the family's farm will fascinate you with a childlike sense of terror. The film's pace was also smartly planned; a well paced build up leads to one of the most intense endings in cinematic history. Overall, this is one of the best works of film I've seen in years, and not only is it an example of what horror movies should be, it's an example of what the art of cinema is.",8,6,12,20 February 2016
