The Blair Witch Project," Self-Destructive Whiners Lost in the Woods
","If you're scared of strange noises and being lost in the woods, you'll be terrified. Otherwise, you'll just get annoyed by the irritating characters, and sore eyes from the continuously jittering camera.The fright devices used in this film are older than dirt, there is no plot to speak of, and it's hard to have any sympathy for the characters. All they do is curse and bicker with each other as they wander in the woods making stupid mistakes. If the boogers didn't get them, they would have starved to death anyway. For example: they're afraid of what's out there, so they all pile into a tent in the dark, blind. Why not build a couple of fires and stand watches?The (anti)climax is a reprise of every cheap slasher film ever made, as they run around blindly in a probably danger zone calling 'Hello? Is that you?'.It's a great concept for a film, but fails utterly in its execution.",Null,0,1,13 August 1999
