Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good to see George making Star Wars Movies again.
","A bit disappointing.  Way too heavy on the computer generated action;  I felt like I was watching an animated feature, not a Star Wars movie. Overall, a good movie, but the Babylon-5 feel to it made it a bit out-of-place in the SW series.  Some of the lines are absolutely horrible. The last thing this movie needed was aliens running around ripping off old Mike Myers lines.  Excellent lightsaber duels and pod race scenes.  I'd rate it much higher if they had stayed away from the overly cute taglines (don't get me wrong -- I love some of the cheese from the originals) and the CG. Best line of the film:  Obi-wan's first line, 'I have a bad feeling about this.'",5,1,2,19 May 1999
