Minority Report," Unpredictable, humorous, yet very serious, #1 movie ever!!!
","Minority Report is the kind of movie no one expects, but everyone anticipates. The ending was a shock to me and any movie that you cannot predict must be a winner. Colin Farrell (Danny Witwer) is the new Brad Pitt and an excellent actor in this movie. I expect to see a lot more of him in the future. This movie makes you laugh, jump, made me nearly cry, and satisfies the entertainment part of you throughout, without leaving you waiting for more. Minority Report is thorough, does not drag, satisfies you, and really proves that there is still hope for new movie topics. If you have not seen it, see it, Minority Report will not let you down!",10,0,0,6 January 2003
