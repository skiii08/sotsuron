The Avengers," Solid movie but does not live up to its massive hype
","Solid movie across the board. I enjoyed it immensely while in the theater. But looking back two months later it was one of those movies that I could live without having to see again and I scarcely remember any of the fine details which make a movie truly stand out and be an all time great.It was a very good film and they really nailed the Hulk this time, especially. Robert Downey, Jr. is still an excellent Iron Man and despite the disappointment of Iron Man 2 in comparison to the first one(which is my all time favorite Marvel movie), it was still very good.I don't believe the Avengers fully lived up to its massive hype but still a good, entertaining and action-packed movie that most comic book and superhero fans should enjoy.",1,3,10,29 June 2012
