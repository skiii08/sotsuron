The Sound of Music," One of the best movie
","This is one of the best film I have ever seen. There are many songs and these songs is very important in this film because these songs bring some changes in character's life.Maria(a governess of Trapp's children) is very Cheerful and active. Mr.Trapp(a military in Hangary)and his children changed through her cheerful. When I watched this film,I got spirits from her.This film is made from a true story so we can learn the history in Austria but some part is different from historical fact.If you have not watch this film, please watch it and enjoy the story and music.",Null,2,8,11 July 2010
