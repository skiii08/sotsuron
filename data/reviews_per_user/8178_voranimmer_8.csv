The Avengers," This is The Film my friend I hope it never ends))
","This is an example of a successful movie. The successful movie is when you watch it breathtaking, easy watching and yet this is a movie very hard to make.The hell of making such a movie is to write a handful of protagonists - each having a separate movie of their own - into a single movie, where all of them should be main characters and equally. A hell of a job)) Yet of all Avengers movies, including Civil War, this one is the best. So.. this is one of the movies you wish it never ends) But first.. I want to praise the role of Cobie Smulders. She is very sexy and played her role of Maria Hill very and very sexy) I'd very much like to have such a girlfriend in me life)) So) The task was to make many episodes like video clips)) where each of the characters have single and impressive dialogue and acting. Then - to unite them all into a movie. Personally, after watching it three times.. I'm a big fan of Scarlett so first time I was all into her.. Second time I watched it I liked the performance of Tom Hiddleston, well.. this is a movie where all actors are just perfect))Tom .. there is something ideal for him to take the role of Loki.. you will never see him as a villain)) You will understand him and have compassion - this is what Marvel is all about)) But today.. as I watched it the third time.. it was all about the connection. about understanding, about to be together. Strange but this third time, I noticed the trust Captain America tried to have to this team, strange and unknown to him.. Sacrifice Iron Man made.. their mutual partnership.. you know.. Marvel's movies are not about fun comics blockbuster they have a meaning) This movie was about understanding and to be together despite all odds) A dialogue between so different people and about not to be alone but to be together)) This is why I love Marvel movies so much) They have this humanity in it)) Beauty of humanity in all of the rage of a blockbuster))So today.. it is about Thor still loving his half brother, Widow saving Arrow, Iron man and Captain working together.. Hulk.. trying so much to be a good man he always is.. This is not thanks God just a superhero movie this a movie about understanding and God! it ends too soon - the movie))Thank you Marvel) It is marvel)) The fairy tale not about heroes but about us))",10,1,1,6 June 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Unnecessary Sacrifice
","Recently Star Wars Universe has become more laid back and entertaining. With younger auditory oriented animation series, Rebels and Clone Wars, and the greatest fan fiction of it all, The Force Awakens, Star Wars seems to loose its burden of tragedy and titanic struggle of few against many. So, Rogue One is an effort to remedy this...Nabooo sunshine with some inferno of Mustafar. Does it work? Well, what does work is a path well trodden - establishing a likable company of heroes, to become the core of future movies and probably TV series. Felicity Jones is energetic, dark, impulsive and virtually non-stoppable. Diego Luna is absolutely stunning and very charismatic. Donnie Yen is a great addition to Star Wars universe, his role is sadly smaller than it should be but he is definitely an actor and martial artist new Star Wars need. And thus, the company gathered, and they all together proceed to...And here follows a strange turn of events. You see, true tragedy lies not in numbers but in depth. There are many deaths in this movie. And they all sort of look like...unnecessary. They all happen in period of ...about 20 minutes of movie time and look more like a hasty wrap-up of urgent movie production issues than a coherent movie story.Agreed, sometimes numbers are in place. In episode III, the massacre of jedies was in tune with the dark storyline, descending into the abyss, but here....it doesn't work. Jyn Erso's struggle to clear her father's name and to become his legacy of freedom and redemption, aspiring higher and higher up to the top of Scarif tower, is impressive and visually symbolic. But the sacrifices....however justified by the highest goal and the better good...do not, historically look like the Battle of Iwo Jima, but more like the trenches of World War One...",6,3,4,14 April 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Steve+Nat=win)
","The only complain about this movie is that action scenes are too quick. Shaking camera and too much happening in seconds makes it hard to follow..apart from that it is a...Marvellous Movie))) Streve Rodgers was not my favorite character from Avengers, until I watched this) I was always into Scarlett) Here... this is what they call an ideal action movie)) with impressive action scenes and usual Avengers stuff - the meaning and the message behind the action. So..to put it simply - this is the best Avengers action movie and probably the best action movie of 2010s)) The joyride of watching this.. and two hours swishing like 15 minutes)) Battle music, Steve being the knight of the world and Scarlett breaking me heart again that I do not have such a marvel in me life)) this is what an action movie is all about))P.S. There is a lot of praise to dramatic performance of actors in drama movies.. but still.. here.. to look so convincing in every second of action scenes like Chris and Scarlett did.. requires no less talent))",10,1,1,22 June 2017
Doctor Strange," Doctor Sherlock Strange)
","This movie is fast. First time I watched it - it looked like half an hour, maybe there is really some 'time trick' in Doctor's Strange fashion)Well, essentially it is Ben's show. Nothing wrong with it. Benedict Cumberbatch is very charismatic, to watch him on screen is always fun. His witty remarks, Dr. House style) his irony and sarcasm, and still - probably to attract audience - his Sherlock persona put right into the character of Stephen Strange, all of this is magic) Yes this movie looks like a stand-alone show of Benedict Cumberbatch. But it is somehow justified by the plot - Stephen Strange was always sort of a diva, egocentric genius, who lived like all the universe was moving around his sun. And he never changed. Rachel McAdams was very nice in her role of a protective girlfriend and the only ally Strange had in his life. Her role of the only satellite in the lonely galaxy of Strange's life should not be underrated and she's very likable in this movie.So, good things are, to sum it up. First - Benedict Cumberbatch, going on with his Sherlock persona - I think everyone who watched the Sherlock show were laughing watching the scene with the collar)) and some others scenes as well)) Second - Rachel McAdams as a loyal,trusting and beautiful character, supporting Doctor Strange in a way like Cameron tried to help Doctor House.Third - Very witty script, and good directing. And still let us be honest. What would this movie be without Ben, his sparkling witty sarcastic remarks and good job of directing? Well... it would be essentially a B-movie. Special effects are impressive and yet a bit boring with the same 'wrap'em buildings' style. First time watching it looks impressive, second time - not so. All attempts on bringing some 'ancient wisdom' and rebirth of a man into a perfect character are not convincing. Personnaly. for me it was a very harsh treatment of a desperate man. Stiil , I like this movie) Not for special effects, not for some Eastern philosophy but for the character Ben's so wonderfully played) As a fan of Marvel's movies, I have this movie in my list of favourites with the Avengers and first three X-Men) There is magic there, Marvel's magic)",7,1,1,6 June 2017
Captain America: Civil War," This is wrong
",Of course this movie is still Avengers stuff I Love. But the message is wrongSome spoilers ahead.1. This line of 'X-vs-Y' movies Hollywood's been making all these years - gets better with every movie...A long way from Alien vs Predator to...for instance - Batman vs Superman. Still it kinda looks like they are out of ideas and playing with characters like toys for your usual summer blockbuster2. It is tragic. I was always with Steve in this movie. Still... the script was written a bit unconvincing...probably because of the Avengers magic...like.... believe it or not - the characters themselves did not want to be in this movie and fight each other. Because they didn't want to be toys for entertainment in the first place. So the perfect Formula of Marvel's - action and deep message - actually didn't work here. The message was too deep on the brink of simply drowning in it and the action was inconsistent.3. The message however was still there - a tragic of a drama of friends fighting each other. On both sides and these both sides are the same and good. Still the thing about this movie is that Marvel actually was not able to decide what part of the Formula -action or the message - they should make a priority. The result - lots of painful dramatic moments and unconvincing action scenes - simply because Avengers are not Batman and Superman - they are a team so they cannot impressively fight each other 'cause they can impressively fight together),5,3,7,23 June 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," What a marvel is - to be human
","This movie is very interesting. There are many critical comments about this movie because of the attempt Marvel has made - to show the human part of superheroes. Little spoilers ahead) This is not the usual Avengers thing..more like X-Men story )This is much more deeper - the family of Hawkeye... moments of romance between Natasha and Bruce. Even the compassion I think many of us can feel to Pietro and Wanda..This is a very beautiful movie because of these moments.The best scene of the movie was the family of Hawkeye, - the only shelter of Avengers... and Clint Barton finally had a very deep and great part of the team here ... I love this movie exactly because of it - no superheroes but just humans like us... the message is very good.P.S. And Scarlett is amazing like always)) the more I watch Avengers movies the more I feel sorry for Bruce and want them to be together. Mark Ruffalo is very good and convincing)))",8,1,3,20 June 2017
Jaws," The Real Danger
","Stevens's message is all in a background) You think it is about a shark) No) It is about the people.The scenery in this particular Spielberg's masterpiece is all about Ignorance..Well..ignorance is one of the eternal messages in Spielberg's movies, it's peak reached in A.I. Artificial Intelligence, but here, what does the shark represent? You think - society as a people lazying on the beach not knowing what awaits them?) Yes)) There is no specific message in this movie , compared to A.I., where the message is clear - Tolerance. Here, however, the Shark represents the Danger. Real Danger. To the society and how it deals with it. Ignorance starts early. Steven fights this particular demon of human society bitterly. A girl dies alone, and a guy..simply fades into slumber...this is actually a very powerful message. Then.. an outlander, Chief Brody fights not the shark but local government concerned with profit, and local population, full of fear and helpless... is it really a shark what is a danger here? The movie is excellent.. Script is fabulous ..every part of it is amazing.Spielber's style - every part of a script challenges the watcher) No fillers at all)) Actors... live here not just act... Spielberg's magic is everywhere))And the message is everywhere also)) We are vulnerable, too used to lead a peaceful life where karate kids train at our fences, where local kids bother us more than.. we all are..after all.. good decent people... not ready for the shark... and what we will do if it appears? Shall we listen to the Voice of Reason? This is what it is all about))",10,1,3,8 April 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The greatest Fanfic in Star Wars Universe)
","This is warm) This feels warm) Like a kid who suddenly got his dream come true - to create his own Star Wars Movie) Onle this kid is an accomplished professional J.J. Abrahms))Come on guys)) Have you ever wondered what is behind the helm of a Stormtrooper?) The Star Wars Universe is diverse. Mostly it is very doom-laden, fate and tragedy universe, except for maybe Rebels show... It is somehow difficult to imagine one watching the original trilogy lazying in the sunny afternoon) So..The Force Awakens is not a fun movie. It's a tribute. Definitely not Lucas' style, but very open to us all..and Daisy Ridley is very convincing and energetic and highly likable) and sexy) I would really look forward to mives like these exploring the possibilities of the Star Wars Universe) And without the Creator's (George Lucas) hard-pressing weight of fate and tragedy for a change))This movie is a fresh air a rain in the desert of Tatooine) May it stay the same...well.. who knows..J.J. is not going to direct the next one)",10,27,72,23 March 2017
