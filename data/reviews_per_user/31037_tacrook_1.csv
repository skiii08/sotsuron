The Lobster," Single people are sent to a hotel in order to find a mate or be turned into an animal
","This movie is sick, pointless, a waste of time, and one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Buyer beware. If you are a sadistic zombie maybe you will like it. If not,you should avoid it. I saw no redeeming value. I Went with 5 other people, none of them liked it either. There was a line of people wanting their money back so I was not alone. The actors were competent, but I found it difficult to find any sympathy whatsoever for any of the characters. This for me is a sign of a bad movie. We have a very violence loving society so maybe this movie is just a statement of our society. Spend your money on something uplifting not depressing and vacuous.",1,30,50,4 June 2016
