Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't listen to the critics (or anyone else for that matter)
","Menace is great-it's Lucas. Lucas is one of our great CLASSIC storytellers. But I had to rate it an 8. The storyline(of course)and the effects(of course, he's the owner of the greatest effect artist company of our time,ILM) I rate a 10+. BUT (and maybe it's because I'm 30 and not 9)when I saw 'Star Wars-A New Hope' in '77, I felt like I was in the X-Wing fighter and I blew up Death Star. At 'Menace', when I walked out of the theater, I felt like I just saw another amazing creation by Lucas. I walked out with a BIG smile, but not the goosebumps. Again, I'm 30 and not 9. But as I said, 'Don't listen to the critics. Or anyone else for that matter'. Go see for it yourself. It definitely will NOT be a waste of your money.",7,0,0,21 June 1999
