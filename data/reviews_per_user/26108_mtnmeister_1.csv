Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny, but Over-Rated and not for the Easily Offended
","A pretty funny film, but certainly not the '10' many give it. Moments of brilliance (the dinner party scene) offset by some crude visuals and humor. More fat, old male gonad shots than I ever need to see again. Rumored to be totally unscripted, part of the films brilliance is the uncertainty of what is spontaneous and real vs. what is contrived. While the film allegedly makes Kazakhastan look bad, it is Americans that come off looking the worst - gay bashing, Jew hating, and cheering for the death of Muslims.The theater we saw it in (a very liberal Californian venue) had a pretty mixed reaction. 1/3 howled with laughter, 1/3 quietly chuckled, and 1/5 were shocked and dismayed. About 10 people walked out but another 20 sneaked in.",7,2,6,10 November 2006
