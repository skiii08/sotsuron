Requiem for a Dream," When I first saw this, I thought it was deep. Then I turned twenty.
","This film reminds me of 'Catcher in the Rye' being one of those things that seem incredibly important and original when you are fifteen or so, and then totally silly as soon as you grow up. Yes, big, Big, BIG tragedy. OOOOH...the drug world. Yes, drugs are bad. Well, for the most part drugs are bad. So is unprocessed sugar. Judging by the size of the average buttock in America and the UK, people need to worry a whole lot more about how much they eat then drugs as far as health is concerned. I wonder if in its time people saw 'reefer madness' a film where a gifted young man with a dream ends up in jail, and his girlfriend in a mental ward, all because they smoked a joint, and reacted just like people did to this film. Lets look at this thing objectively; Point 1)This movie seems to miss is the purpose of bail. You do not actually need to post the entire amount. Also, you get all of that money BACK as soon as the person in question appears at the trial date. The state doesn't KEEP bail money. Its not a fine. Its collateral. Point 2) And possibly the DUMBEST thing in the film is how Harry and Tyrone are arrested because a doctor saw the signs of drug use. What exactly are they arrested for? It is NOT illegal to be a drug user. Its only illegal to possess drugs. It doesn't matter if you use them or not. What are they charged with? Track marks? Possessing money? Driving? I mean honestly. The message of the film is if you use drugs you will fail at everything you try to accomplish, loose your limbs and your mind. OK, I applaud the attempt to keep people away from dangerous substances, but making up nonsense scenarios to do it is just lame.",1,3,8,8 September 2017
Wind River," It was really good in soime ways, really bad in other ways
","The acting is amazing, especially Renner. The scenes well crafted. But the plot was just laughably bad. there were no clues to the mystery. It was like one minute you know nothing, the next you know everything. And Jane, poor jane must be litetrally the dumbest, and most inept FBI agent ever born.",10,1,6,28 September 2017
Hostel," why the hostility towards this movie?
","Its really not worth ten stars, but so many people are disliking the story for no good reason, I felt like i should even it out. First of all, I am EXTREMELY disturbed by people saying they had no sympathy for young men being tortured to death because they 'didn't like them enough'. Really? I would have sympathy for anyone brutally murdered. Then we have the people who are upset with portrayal of Slovalkia, or upset that a gay character was portrayed as a bad person. Get over it. Gay people can be as bad or as good as anyone else. The film is clever enough. There isn't much story, but what there is fits together very well. The reason they were killed is because someone felt like killing them for gratification, and they had the opportunity because they are foreigners. Thats it.",10,1,4,2 July 2017
The Mist," an illogical mess
","Besides the less then stelar opinion of mankind presented, the movie has nothing to offer. The most egregious insult is the fact that the stupid woman that went out into the mist that killed everyone because her kids were alone made it out safe. HOW? By some magic that protects idiots who think kids are the most extra special thing ever? Garbage. And how did everyone not realize they were dealing with animals from somewhere else? It seemed pretty clear that the mist was the atmosphere they needed, so if they worked on getting rid of the mist itself, maybe they would have made it. Also, the idea that religious people crack up is old. And boring. I bet most religious people would stay logical and good natured longer then some liberal kiddie. Just waay too typical.",2,3,6,29 September 2016
Murder on the Orient Express," Meh. Too much added political correctness which made a boring adaptation just that much more boring.
","Im not sure if they were trying to make it modern, or what they were doing, but all they managed to do was put me to sleep. The re writing was just vile. It completely contradicts the reality of the 1930's. No one would have gone to a black doctor then, not even if he had been in the war, and had been sponsored by someone. It was all about current issues. The word 'race' was said over 20 times until I lost count. I just got tired of them talking about segregation laws, and whatever else. Not that this isn't a worthwhile subject, but it simply does not belong in a Agatha Christie mystery at all. Then they went out of their way to go after sexism, making sure Penelope Cruz's character was 'trained to fight' which is also absurd given the time period, and generally absurd given that she is tiny, and a reasonably healthy fifteen year old boy could probably win a fight with her. Agatha Chritie didn't write Buffy. The most likeble character was Ratchett himself, which is a big problem, and the opposite of what Christie wrote. I can't think of a worse adaptation of this work, and I have seen many. Just terrible.",2,83,149,13 November 2017
