The Avengers," Whedon establishes his name with directorial debut
","Joss Whedon, who has made a name in television, namely for ANGEL (tv, 1999-2004), FIREFLY (tv, 2002-2003), and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (tv, 1996-2003), as well as having written the screenplays of TOY STORY (1995), ALIEN: RESURRECTION (1997), TITAN A.E. (2000), and the concurrently showing CABIN IN THE WOODS (2012), establishes himself as a full-fledged director with a big bang. THE AVENGERS features an array of box office stars, fantastic special effects and tightly-directed action scenes, with a sprinkling of dramatic moments and comedic relief (mostly from Robert Downey Jr's wisecracks and Clark Gregg's gay-like adulation of Chris Evans' character). The major players (Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Incredible Hulk) are introduced briefly but markingly, and from the onset you know Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has his hands full, bringing together this group of superheroes with flamboyantly clashing personalities. The tesseract, a cosmic cube of debatable origins that has unlimited powers, has been stolen, and Fury assembles the Avengers to retrieve this cube. Villainy is provided deliciously by Tom Hiddleston as Loki, and Gwyneth Paltrow is a welcome addition (from Downey's IRON MAN films) -- as well as Colbie Smulders, making her Marvel film debut as Agent Maria Hill. Only the last third of the film loses steam, with one vaguely wondering why the robots-attack- city scenario is oddly familiar (TRANSFORMERS, anyone?). An ambiguous ending also mars the otherwise energetic proceedings, with Thor accosting his brother Loki back to Asgard. Alan Silvestri's vivid musical score adds to the kinetic frenzy, and Seamus McGarvey's cinematography is impressive. Whedon has crafted a well-crafted action movie with much visceral excitement and an earnest cast.",9,1,4,16 May 2012
Argo," Affleck will have staying power, a la Eastwood
","ARGO, from Warner Bros. Pictures, is a well-padded film that tackles the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis (52 American hostages were held hostage inside the US embassy, during Carter's presidency, for a gruelling 444 days!) but with a fanciful twist that, in the hands of a lesser star-director, would have come up shorthanded or even mundane and trashy. But Ben Affleck has come a long way from goofy performances (1997's CHASING AMY, 1999's FORCES OF NATURE) and ever since his marvelous team-up with Matt Damon for 1997's GOOD WILL HUNTING (for which they won the screen writing Oscar), Affleck has shown he IS a force of nature to be reckoned with. Take THE TOWN (2010), a heist movie that was an uncanny character study as well, which Affleck starred in and directed (culling an Oscar-nominated performance out of costar Jeremy Renner), with 23 nominations from various bodies and academies. Even earlier, take GONE BABY GONE (2007), an abducted-child thriller, with Affleck also directing an Oscar-nominated performance out of Amy Ryan, the film replete with 12 nominations from various fronts. The 42-year-old Affleck has, as of press time, the distinction of sheperding a CIA-thriller into an astounding 63 nominations! For the 2013 Oscars alone, wit: Film Editing, William Goldenberg; Original Musical Score, Alexandre Desplat; Sound Editing, Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn; Sound Mixing, John T. Reitz; Gregg Rudloff; José Antonio Garcia; Best Motion Picture of the Year (Affleck, Clooney, Grant Heslov) Supporting Actor, Alan Arkin; Best Screenplay, Chris Terrio. If you've loved films like STATE AND MAIN (2000) and THE LAST SHOT (2004), ARGO will stun you, despite its taking 'poetic' liberties (part of the actual events are glossed over, some parts in the film are fictitious, etc.) -- as it straddles the fine line between movie-making tract and CIA thriller. Affleck scores well by underplaying CIA agent Tony Mendez, who helped rescue 5 State Department agents to safety. How did Mendez do it? By pretending to be part of a filmmaking crew shooting in Tehran! Affleck disappears into the role, sporting a goatee and appearing meek yet hardworking, bedraggled and contradicted by superiors, yet his mind devising a million ways to lead both his team and the hostages to safety. Alan Arkin (Oscar-nominated), John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, Victor Garber and Kyle Chandler lend solid support, while the 6 important hostages (Tate Donovan, Clea Duvall, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham, Kerry Bishé) convey terror, anxiety and (later) collective relief grittily. Much like his earlier project THE TOWN, Affleck directs with an eye for detail, creating nerve-wracking situations and interspersing it with comic relief from the faux film crew (Goodman is especially luminous, Garber hilariously spot-on). Affleck's technical crew is splendid as well (aside from the Oscar nominees, cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto telegraphs the terror of the hostages, the nastiness and utter evil of the hostage-takers, and the grace-under-duress whimsicality of the faux film crew, beautifully; Oscar-nominated Alexandre Desplat has also created evocative music to convey all those mixed emotions. I wasn't impressed much with Affleck from titles I've viewed like Armageddon, PEARL HARBOR and even REINDEER GAMES (dismissing his popularity as just a fluke, more so with the laughable DAREDEVIL), but his involvement with PAYCHECK (from my favorite sci-fi author, Philip K. Dick) and his articulate helming of THE TOWN has changed my mind about his just being 'an ex of J-Lo and Gwyneth.' Here is an intelligent actor-director that will have staying power for years to come. His good looks are a bonus! (',)",Null,1,4,12 February 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Danish director Tommy Wirkola, only 34l, capably directs a fairy tale with an inventive twist; Famke Janssen is perfect femme fatale
","HANSEL AND GRETEL starts just like the 1812 published fairy tale (Grimm Brothers based it on German legends) -- two young siblings being abandoned by their parents, and encountering a gingerbread house owned by an ugly witch. Inventively, the film inserts newspaper clippings (made to look ancient) chronicling what happens after Hansel and Gretel's shocking feat of that first witch and their being fearless witch-hunters, tracking down every last witch and exterminating them from the world. As Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) enter a new town, they encounter an antagonistic sheriff (Peter Stormare), a hapless mayor who has wisely hired the witch-hunters to help rid the town of the terrorist hags, missing children, more frightful and powerful witches... and even a troll. The town's major crisis is the coming Blood Moon, for which the coven needs the heart of 12 children for unimaginable and unlimited powers. The mystery of why Hansel and Gretel's parents abandoned them unravels, as the troll inexplicably saves Gretel from the dastardly Sheriff Berringer and his henchmen. Hansel is also provided a love interest in the young woman (Pihla Viitala) they earlier rescue from charges of being a witch -- or is she? To reveal more would render me an insufferable spoilsport (I've just outlined the key scenes), but suffice it to say that Renner (fresh from the success of the Manila-shot BOURNE LEGACY) and Arterton (still indelibly imprinted in my mind from her film appearances, nymphlike, from PRINCE OF PERSIA and CLASH OF THE TITANS, both 2010) are up to the task, with terrific martial arts/fight scenes, and Famke Janssen (whom everybody knows as Jean Grey) is deliciously luminous as the would-be queen of witches, Muriel. Janssen (my favorite actress after Rebecca de Mornay) is always a delight to watch, and here she relishes every scene she's in, despite the frightful witch makeup that covers her Danish beauty. Even the 'two ugly sisters' (of Muriel) are no weak ladies, ready to combat Hansel (or Gretel). Atli Örvarsson's moody music, and the atmospheric set pieces of 1800s Germany, well-photographed by Michael Bonvillain, enhance the flashy, well-choreographed direction of Tommy Wirkola (a 34-year-old Norwegian filmmaker who only has three directorial credits before HANSEL!).",9,0,4,12 February 2013
Mama," Muschietti, del Toro and Chastain create the perfect ghost movie with an added conceit
","From Guillermo del Toro, the visionary behind CRONOS (1993), MIMIC (1997), BLADE 2 (2002), HELLBOY (2004), and PAN'S LABYRINTH (2006)... and newbie director AndrÃ©s Muschietti, MAMA is an electrifying ghost movie that hits the right spots.*Warning: descriptionary spoilers.*The chilling prologue (of how the two very young kids were abandoned by a deranged father, and left to fend for themselves), has the viewer glued frightened to his/her seat, and from the first shot (eerily photographed by Antonio Riestra) down to the shocker ending, the scares relentlessly pile up on one another! The inevitable ghost shows itself layer by layer (initially a dark hole in the wall with moths creeping out freakishly, then an ominous shadow, then an unearthly cackle and a hypnotic lullaby, then a blackened, wizened hand straight out of the HARRY POTTER films, etc.) until the complete apparition displays itself in full (deathly) regalia. While I posted some cases of children being raised by feral animals in my FaceBook wall, MAMA adopts an even trickier and more freakish concept -- and even if I seem to be spoiling the surprise here, you can connect the dots and even predict the plot, although Muschietti and producer del Toro craft the film as if the 'ghost' plot and 'feral children' subplot should already be obvious to the viewer, and instead concentrate on revving up the scare factor -- full blast. Laudably (for a horror movie), the support characters are well drawn: a determined psychiatrist, a busybody and righteous aunt, the feral children, and even the brief role of the deranged father... while the two leads (Jessica Chastain and Danish actor Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) are cast perfectly (although the handsome Coaster-Waldau, midway through MAMA, spends the rest of the film in the hospital, having survived a close call with the titular specter... remember poor Eric Stoltz in ANACONDA?) Chastain, an actress on a roll (after her starmaking performances in two 2011 film, THE TREE OF LIFE and THE HELP, and her lead role in the recent ZERO DARK THIRTY), is simply tremendous, never hitting a false note as a punker girlfriend reluctantly forced to take care of the two kids and save them from something horrible and unfathomable. Intelligently, the script (by Muschietti, Barbara Muschietti and Neil Cross) avoids predictability by having Chastain play a punker who is never bitchy or obnoxious, but rather, finds it in her heart to be a surrogate mother to two young kids from the vengeful and covetous claws of the titular specter. The two young kids playing the feral children, Megan Charpentier (as the older Victoria) and Isabel NÃ©lisse (as the younger, deeply traumatized Lily) are incredible. (SPOILER!!!) The scene where (after the children have been missing for 5 years) the children are first encountered in a creepy house is bound to haunt your memory for months to come! Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, a handsome Danish 43-year-old who looks 20 years younger, offers two uncanny performances: as the deranged father ready to kill his wife and children, and the softhearted brother, Uncle Lucas to the kids. If you were blown over by the panoramic visuals of del Toro's PAN'S LABYRINTH or impressed by the hellish settings of del Toro's HELLBOY, expect a different palette here -- a ghost story with a trick conceit, directed with flair, intelligently performed, hitting all the right spots the way a proper horror movie should!",10,2,4,19 February 2013
Jack Reacher," Tom Cruise overcomes miscasting and adds JACK REACHER to his rich repertoire of diverse roles
","(SPOILERS!) JACK REACHER. A private investigator (they used to be called P.I.'s in the old days) named Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is reluctantly called in by a pretty defense attorney (Rosamund Pike) to unravel the mystery behind 5 seemingly random shootings. But Reacher finds out the accused guy, Barr (Joseph Sikora), is the trigger-happy Army soldier who was responsible for several shootings but got away with it. And Reacher, who was also previously in the Army as a criminal investigator, has vowed to put him away for life if he catches Barr doing it again. As layer by layer of this crime story unravels, we find the pretty lawyer, Helen Ronin, actually going against the grain -- her father (Richard Jenkins) is the D.A.! And Reacher himself is such a shady character both Ronin and her father, at odds with each other from the get-go, try to dig for skeletons in Reacher's closet. Is Barr guilty, or is he just being set up? Throw in for good measure a police detective (David Oyelowo) who has his own secrets and the guilty sniper himself, Charlie (Jai Courtney)... as Reacher and Ronin delve deeper, somebody is willing to murder again and again.Christopher McQuarrie is the brilliant writer behind 1995's THE USUAL SUSPECTS (a favorite of several cinephiles I call friends); 2000's THE WAY OF THE GUN; 2008's Tom Cruise Hitler-themed film VALKYRIE; and 2010's Angelina Jolie/Johnny Depp whodunit THE TOURIST. McQuarrie writes convoluted plots well, and let's see how his two upcoming Tom Cruise films will fare (supposedly a TOP GUN SEQUEL, and MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE 5 in 2015). But with JACK REACHER, McQuarrie (who wrote AND directed) again amazes us with his skill of crafting a film with seemingly easy plots that quickly unravel and exposes truths and untruths in startlingly compelling manner. I'm sure if JACK REACHER, based on the Lee Child novels, had a secondary female role, McQuarrie would have been up to the task and weave it in seamlessly.Lee Child fans are quibbling about Cruise's (mis)casting, pointing out such specifications as 'he stands 6'5' and weighs 250 lbs...' but Cruise is such a magnetic movie star that you find yourself being drawn in... in fact, much as others would dismiss this as just another Bond/Bourne wannabe, McQuarrie has crafted a worthy thriller, with only two setbacks: (1) as character study, JACK REACHER fails to give us insight into what makes Reacher tick, how was his past like (an in-passing dossier narration by Ronin and/or the D.A. father doesn't count!), and (2) the chemistry between Tom Cruise and Rosamund Pike, the sexual tension is there, but is left obliquely hanging in the wind. Pike is lovely (never more so in WRATH OF THE TITANS) and her characterization, strong, isn't a mere decoration or caricature of a lady lawyer, and I don't know if in the novel 'One Shot' Reacher and Helen have a bed scene, but the film's last third leaves you thinking it's like a Charles Bronson dramatic thriller but with Bronson ignoring the delights of, say, a Lee Remick or Jill Ireland. I say this without being a male chauvinist pig, just my usual hopeless-romantic self.Robert Duvall, all of 82 (an a renowned Argentine tango aficionado), and esteemed film director Werner Herzog, 71, add welcome brio as an ally and a heavy, respectively, while TV star Alexia Fast makes her mark as a wilful nymphet who meets a grisly end. Cruise tries to give a different spin to such a character as this, although on the printed page it could be not much different from his signature Ethan Hunt, or the Jason Bourne/James Bond cornucopia of indestructible secret agents, and because of McQuarrie's able pen and direction, succeeds (nitpicking critics be damned). The supporting cast, especially Courtney and Oyelowo, and even a trio of young goons, are also up to par. All through out the action never lags, although McQuarrie and cast have chosen to paint the film as a character study with a relaxed pacing and layer-by-layer exposition.Kudos to Joe Kramer's throbbing music; also, Caleb Deschanel photographs JACK REACHER glossily. As a footnote, I've been seeing the trailer of JACK THE GIANT SLAYER (directed by Bryan Singer of X-MEN fame), and I can't wait to see how McQuarrie has penned the characters of Jack, the princess, the townsfolk and the giants.",8,4,9,4 February 2013
Dark Shadows," Limpid energy sustained only by Depp and three beautiful costars
","DARK SHADOWS was created for TV by Dan Curtis, which aired from 1966- 1971. The new film is reverentially written by John August and Seth Grahame-Smith. Johnny Depp topbills, with Michelle Pfeiffer, Eva Green, Helena Bonham Carter and Chloë Grace Moretz. 'An imprisoned vampire, Barnabas Collins (Depp), is set free and returns to his ancestral home, where his dysfunctional descendants are in need of his protection.' (imdb.com). Depp adds another rich character to his cornucopia of inimitable delineations, with much pizzaz and gloss, as a man-about-town in 1752 Collinsport, Maine, who is turned into a vampire and buried alive. Eva Green is (initially) exquisite as the witch, Angeline, who curses him after he spurns her affections, and Pfeiffer and Bonham Carter are topnotch as Depp's circa-1972 descendants, living in Collinwood Manor. Tim Burton's stories and movies have always bordered on the macabre, but DARK SHADOWS, despite the invigorating performances from the cast, is never as horribly menacing as his SWEENEY TODD (2007) or CORPSE BRIDE (2005), although beautifully layered like BIG FISH (2003), CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005) and ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010). Even replicating the poignancy of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990) or the frenetic pace of MARS ATTACKS! (1996) would have been welcome pluses. Thankfully, Depp is an actor with a Michael Caine/Christopher Lee penchant for an eclectic filmography, and his Barnabas Collins rises from the limpid energy sustained feebly by the film. Christopher Lee, famous for horror films from 1950s-1980s, is wasted in a brief role; a pity, he could have energized what scenes he had. Even Eva Green, my new favorite actress from CASINO ROYALE, appears to channel Elvira, Mistress of the Dark (actress Cassandra Peterson). This film has all the components of a successful horror picture but modern-day audiences may find it hard to relate to the 1970s-set dialogue, much as the flamboyant costumes, wigs and sets (by Rick Heinrichs) add sparkle to Burton's otherwise aimless remake of the popular 1960s TV show. Kudos also to Danny Elfman, who always provides thrilling music for Burton's ouvres. However, DARK SHADOWS is a must for Depp completists and fans of Green, Pfeiffer of Bonham Carter.",7,0,2,16 May 2012
Cloud Atlas," CLOUD ATLAS is a multi-layered mosaic with mixed results but overall, A for Effort
","CLOUD ATLAS is a multi-layered mosaic,sometimes plodding, sometimes frenetic, spanning various centuries, with top-drawer names in multiple roles. If you get past the sometimes unintelligible dialog of Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Susan Sarandon (others speak more clearly), and the yawn-inducing slow pace of the film's first half, much can be enjoyed from the directorial trio of Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowksy (helmers of the MATRIX films) and Tom Tykwer, as an experimentally ambitious project. We are given a kaledeiscopic ride of history, romance, villainy and intrigue, and lends us ponderous insight into the workings and vagaries of the human soul (and human mind). The story arcs overlap and intersect, some with bittersweet endings, others with catharsis and hope. The sci-fi subplot (with medieval Hanks and alien-like Berry) goes on a bit too long, but the other stories fare better. Comic relief comes deliciously from Jim Broadbent, as is villainy from Hanks and MATRIX costar Hugo Weaving. The sets are fantastically designed and the music, throbbing, is excellent",7,0,2,12 February 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Hemsworth shines in otherwise derivative slasher film (with computer-game concept added as a twist)
","CABIN IN THE WOODS (2011) is the (horror) film that Australian beefcake Chris Hemsworth managed to appear in just before rising to stardom, in the same year, with the blockbuster THOR. Easily enough like other slasher films where the young (often goodlooking) leads get killed one by one (a very old premise, used by Dame Agatha Christie in her 1939 AND THEN THERE WERE NONE a.k.a. TEN LITTLE INDIANS), director Drew Goddard and writer Joss Whedon add their own twist by mixing a horror theme with a computer-game concept, where the 'test subjects' are led on to a grisly adventure as the technicians control the whole environment, but inevitably things get out of hand. Mix Sean Penn's film THE GAME with SCREAM, or something like that. In a nutshell, Hemsworth and his friends wander around the titular cabin, where they unwittingly unleash a horde of zombies... who simply won't die! CABIN IN THE WOODS suffers from shoddy cinematography (Peter Deming), wide-eyed acting by the two female leads (Anna Hutchison, Kristen Connolly) and a bizarre concept, and as a whole has the feel of a 1970s B movie. Only the presence of Richard Jenkins (as one of the technicians) and the surprise appearance of Sigourney Weaver, and Chris Hemsworth's performance, raise this slasher film notches above others of its ilk. You can easily see star quality in Hemsworth, only 28 when he made this (and when he appeared in THOR immediately after) with this early title in his filmography.",8,1,4,27 February 2013
