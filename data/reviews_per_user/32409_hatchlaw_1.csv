The Incredible Hulk," Norton in Avengers? What about Tim Blake Nelson
","I just saw this movie. Very cool, and vastly superior to the Ang Lee offering. I heard a rumor that Ed Norton is embarrassed by the final product, and isn't interested in doing it again.Anyone know if he is Edward Norton signed on for the Avengers movie? What about Tim Blake Nelson's character?They way he got infected led me to think we'll see him again (as a villain perhaps?)Who else thinks IMDb is getting too big for their britches with these new rules? I can't think of 10 lines on everything. I'm not a professional movie reviewer, but that's my 2 cents. I usually post a single question in the comments section, hoping for an answer to my confusion. So much for that. After wading through 10 lines on each post, I will be too bored to keep up with this site. I hope they lighten up:0)",Null,3,6,22 June 2008
