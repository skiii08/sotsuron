Ali," I'd like all 158 minutes of my life back
","Ali was definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen. But - it's close. Don't get me wrong, there were some amazing parts of this movie. Will Smith does a fantastic job, some of the best acting of his career. The rest of the acting, directing and presentation were also good. But the story is horrendous.You find Ali as a person you don't really like but you don't hate him either. You pretty much just end up not respecting him but at the same time not caring. And if the movie leaves you not caring about the main character, it makes it tough to care about the movie.Also, while the movie is filled with potentially controversial and interesting issues that could be used to help make the movie less boring, none of these issues are brought up in detail.No one in the group of friends I saw it with thought the movie was worth the money and time we gave it. I'd encourage you to keep your $8 and 2 and half hours and use them for something more productive.",3,0,0,13 January 2002
American Beauty," There is something wrong if you don't enjoy this movie.
","This movie is simply beautiful. In fact, beauty is one of it's central themes. Yes - I just said that this movie has themes! And that's why it's good.It has moral questions at it's base which provoke the viewer.And what really gets me is these people who post about the terrible nudity and sex in this movie. They make it sound like some kind of porno. Really, there are only three brief scenes of nudity. And there are no scenes of actual intercourse. As well, the scenes of nudity present a theme of innocence - not something dirty. In fact, one nude scene is used to show the true interest Ricky has in Jane. As she removes her top, he adjusts his filming to - her face.Other complaints about stereotypes are equally unfounded. Again, like the nudity - they are present, but their presence is used to develop the movie. The reason stereotypes exist is because, well... they exist. Everyone uses them. Right or wrong, they are a reality, and this movie tries - and in my opinion - succeeds in presenting a reality.The movie is good because it presents themes based in a presented reality. Nudity and stereotypes both exist in our reality and are used to further the themes. Unless you are some type of extremist or reactionary who can not simply look at the presented value of the nudity and stereotypes of this movie, you will enjoy this movie. In fact, you'll enjoy this movie a lot.And, if you don't enjoy this movie - you either are incapable of deep thought which this movie attempts to provoke or are such an extremist you are distracted from the actual content of the movie.  ....Or some punk thirteen year old kid who shouldn't have been allowed in the theater in the first place was making out with his girlfriend behind you the whole time, which would run any movie.",10,0,0,4 November 1999
