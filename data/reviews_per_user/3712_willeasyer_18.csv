Blade Runner 2049," loved it!
","Did you spot the reference to Spike Jonze's Her?
This movie is a treat, one of the rarest sequels that surpass the original and like the original, it will live for many years to come and age perfectly like a nice bottle of wine. Visually it's a masterpiece like a space-time colorful LSD trip, the cinematography is beautiful, outstanding and ecstatic thanks to the work of Roger Deakins who succeeds at creating an apocalyptic, empty and lonely future at the image of our protagonist. Plus this movie learned from its predecessor faults; it gave us characters with depth and struggle and a nicely built up story full of turns and twists something the original movie lacked I don't know if it was on purpose or not but it took off from it, but in 2049 we dive deep into the characters lives for example, we see joe at home, joe the human and Joe the lover unlike Deckard in 1982 we see joe outside work, and we feel his struggle, loneliness, and identity crisis and this adds to the complexity of the plot with its thematic about the search of meaning and love, and its universal question 'what makes us humans?'. I really loved it even if it was long and the ending is just outstanding one of the best I've ever seen so rather than focusing on the special one (the girl) they focused on a simple copy, its identity, and its the existential crisis in the middle of a replicant revolution! and this is one of the points that bothered a lot of fans who wanted to see more action and more time, but this movie isn't about action nor rhythm, it's a study of life through the Joe and if you're looking for a simply entertaining action movie this is not the one for.",8,0,1,28 January 2018
Your Name.," Amazing !!!!!
","What a beautiful movie and what an amazing story very minimal yet so complexe ( some christopher nolan animated shit lol), I am so pumped, first time an animation movie makes me wanna visit a country lol this film is an epopé, it explores different deep themes that we can't explore in one review , it's an epopé about our search for meaning, the signification of loveand identity; a movie about that deep longing for something or someone you can't quite grasp, the yearning that haunts you and leads you to find the remedy for the hole in your heart and find love or meaning, I guess that's what the movie is about. I love how the characters change for the better after knowing each other Mitsuha became more confident and serene thanks to him and Taki became more empathic and calm thanks to her they're both opposites still they complete and elevate each other, a beautiful illustration of what love should be. already a classic and I don't get the Oscars snub!",9,2,3,26 January 2018
500 Days of Summer," one of the most touching romances in cinema history
","Before today I've never got the chance to watch it and focus on it from beginning to end, so I needed to give it a nice watch because I genuinely identify it plus I love the smiths, and I've been waiting to find that sparkle of true love since ever. Besides the obviosity of its visual beauty, excellent directing, writing and music it's a movie that describes what's like to be in love in a non conventional way, where the characters aren't the main subject. It's mainly about love and all phases of relationships with all its ups and downs and in such a stunning detail starting from the secret crush to honeymoon phase until reality catches up. It's about true love, and how unexpected and random it is, it can never be planned it just happens. That's why it touched me on a personal level if a relationship is over it means it wasn't the right one yet the most important thing is moving on and focusing on oneself and love will come at the right time without rush and that's what happened to Tom.",8,0,0,3 April 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Dark, funny, poignant and provocative
","This movie deserves every Oscar nomination and award it got, It's a bold statement about America right now. It's filled with Drama delivered through comedy without falling into parody, it will make you laugh and tear your heart down all thanks to its complex characters and poignant themes such as police brutality, Rape and racism, So it's OK if you find yourself riding a roller coaster of feelings while watching. Those billboards are nothing but a symbol of a belief or a stand that everyone else is against and the movie teaches us to stand for those beliefs and fight for them no matter what's the outcome. It's also a representation of our time as you can see those billboards as tweets too, tweets that made the whole community talking about the case and at the same time taking action. A typical image of social media's era with #metoo hashtags and many more... To conclude, this movie isn't about Mildred finding her daughter's rapist but about her standing up in the face of injustice and standing up for herself but the one thing I would reproach to this beautiful story is the ending that felt cut in the middle and ambiguous yet it doesn't change the fact that it's one of this year's best movies and one of my all-time favorites",9,7,15,16 February 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," What a great surprise!
","I was really sceptic about this film at first but after watching it I I'm really surprised! This was actually really really good everything about it is about it is innovative and the story I thought it was childish is really complex and deep. The animation of this film is unlike anything you've ever seen unlike Pixar that tends to focus on realism this one is surreal and isn't afraid of it's animation status, it takes advantage of it. The colors, the comic theme the excellent soundtrack all is mesmerizing. Yet that's not all the rapport between our characters is very humain and heartfelt especially the Spidermen, despite it been animated you feel the depth of the bond they formed more particularly the one between miles and peter parker with there father son, big young bothers Dynamic that's can't but make you aw. Plus i guess i have a thing for peter parker too hihi. In general this was a surprise a hell of a good one!!",10,0,0,5 June 2019
The Battle of Algiers," when you recreate reality!
","I grew up watching this movie. where I came from it's considered as a nationalist artifact, it's shown each national and independence day. So for me, it was only a revolutionary and national film that depicts the cruelty f the french colonization in Algeria that I memorized scene by scene. it was only until recently that I decided to see the film for what it really is and getting a restored copy of it. After not watching it for almost 10 years, I tried to stay unbiased and take it for what it is, and to my surprise, I was in trance. it's one of the best movies ever made, why? Because it readapts the truth so meticulously it feels like a documentation of the reality itself. the film doesn't take sides, it doesn't try to give the right to any side on the expense of the other, this movie doesn't play ethics, it just shows the terror that goes on both sides and the story flow to the rhythm of these true events perfectly restaged, to the point it can be considered as a minute by minute reportage of the events. The war of Algiers was so eventful on itself, the Algerian revolutionaries so complex they didn't need writing and it was made 3 years after the Algerian independence so the memories were fresh, the feelings and terror still lived and felt, it's impossible to make such movie nowadays, Every scene is perfect and felt intensely. this movie is cinema witnessing history. perfection",10,0,0,13 May 2020
Toy Story 4," the end we deserve
","This movie came at the right time of my life. like woody in toy story 4 I felt senseless, I lost my sense of purpose, and what used to give my existence meaning one day seems to be drained or I have outgrown it. Yet I was clinging to that routine and life. without it, my reality would be a complete void. That's what woody is dealing with, all his life he found meaning through making Randy happy, the last one who cherished him. But, now he's owned by Bonnie things don't seem to go well, as he ends up unused in the closet. So he tries to force a scenario where he makes her happy not for the sake of 'making her happy' but for the feeling of fulfillment, even indirectly by protecting sparky. However, he ends up realizing that life changes and chapters go by. and like any other toy story film, this one is also an epopÃ© about moving on, not the same way as the third where the moving on represented growing up. here the moving forward is accepting the unknown, embracing the changes of wind and trusting your guts. it's an existential tale disguised as a kid's story. and god, how touching, relatable, emotional and funny it was! For me, it's the best toy story film and the end we truly deserved.",9,5,8,28 September 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," I don't get it! sorry.
","This movie was an experience full of adrenaline rush! for the sake of all the great fights, all our heroes stuck under the same roof. However even if it was fun and pretty much enjoyable I didn't really get into it and the problem here is the fact I am not that into the Marvel universe and this movie felt like a sequel to every standalone Marvel film that came out last year so I felt like I was missing on something, and couldn't fully connect to the story it was like starting to harry potters saga with the 4th movie, you'll enjoy the action but you won't feel passion and compassion to the characters. and this is the case with every Marvel movie I've seen so far.",6,1,4,10 October 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A beautiful odd to Hollywood
","This film is Quentin Tarantino showing us how much he knows about film history. In general it's really good, the cinematography is outstanding the retro nostalgia and the acting are the main attraction here, especially Leo and Brad pitt who gave a very memorable interpretations and the last part of the film is typical Tarantino carnage. However it felt like it lacked a stream and a story it was spinless, even if the overall build up is something to admire it didn't go anywhere special in term of story telling. But that didn't bother me particulary because I was able to enjoy every other great thing in this movie from the beautifully Filmed and curated sections and scenes to the perfect soundtrack.",8,1,1,8 February 2020
A Quiet Place," Fascinating!
","Am not a horror movie type of guy, I have nothing against the genre but it's just not for me. However, I can't state that about A Quiet place because John Krasinski won me hands down. This movie is mesmerizing from the amazing directing by John to the acting, the wonderful cinematography and score, the concept of a silent world where a whisper could get you killed is fascinating same thing about this family that arrives to communicate, converse and stay close even without a spoken language is interesting and enchanting at the same time. I loved the protective and serene figures of John Krasinski and Emily blent who was amazing in her role! and I really appreciated the way the movie builds anticipation and thrill around silence yet it's very overwhelming and stirring at the end I really shed a tear, even if I can reproach the slow pace at the beginning nevertheless the whole thing isn't affecting by it. great experience",8,1,2,29 June 2018
Call Me by Your Name," a Visual Poem !
","A Summer Love like no Other...
This film isn't a movie C'est Une Oeuvre d'Art for the sake of art! Coming from one of my favorite books I've been waiting for it since two years now and it was everything I expected and more It's Erotic, lustful and sensual yet beautifully vulgar, aesthetically pleasing and engaging, established in this beautifully cultured bourgeoisie. It's a visual poem and both, a sophisticated pure love portrayed through high arts, classical music, poetry and sculpture and a Lustful, crude
and X-rated, steamy love as Elio and Oliver go from playing Love compositions and citing poems about entrapped love to Wild Love making and Peach* eating ;) all set in a colorful summer in this romantic village in Italy and the result is just beautiful, heart-warming and heart breaking too. I just loved how they grew to love each other more with each day as they got comfortable with their attraction and explored their love rather than boxing it in, going from defensive and tension to vulnerable and relieved and this was a joy to watch and Mr. Perlman's (Michael Stuhlbarg) lines to Elio at the end must be one of the most touching and evocative movie lines I've ever heard and the last scene is just heart-wrecking. A cénimatic masterpiece!",9,1,3,20 February 2018
Coco," My Heart is Aching!
","I was deeply touched by This movie as a musician and a music junkie I deeply identify and project myself to Miguel as he fights to follow his dream to play music, be himself and confront the obstacles even if it meant taking consequential risks. An epic about the meaning of family, passion, standing up and the power to bring people together with music. Pixar are well known with movies that talk to the old and young demographics particularly this one, it's a fun happy movie with its dark corners for adults to decode; about the meaning of life and memory I did shed a tear at the end, this is by far one of the most stirring and heart-warming Pixar originals since Up and definitely one of my favorite animations of all time.",9,1,2,11 February 2018
Cold War," This film is a Beauty
","What a beautiful film; it should win an Oscar just for the cinematography. give it to anyone who has no idea when it came out and they will tell you it was made in the '50s! A brilliant film, it doesn't fail to immerse you in the story and the universe beyond the 4:3 format; it's equitably paced and very well acted. a passioned love story in the middle of the cold war, filled with drama, craving, and lust; add to it its film noir feel plus it's a Time travel and a perfect depiction and reproduction of that era. Yet the most impressive thing about this movie is its perfectionism and the immense focus on every detail even the small ones from the design, the music, the set, clothes, the framing etc ......this film is excellence .",8,1,4,25 December 2018
The Shape of Water," A needed Gem in a Time of hate and rage
","This movie is unusual, odd and queer. I wouldn't come out ld with such an atypical story in a million year, and that's what makes it alluring the fact that it takes you by surprise, that you don't know what to expect. Add to it, it's aesthetically pleasing to the senses and the mind, del Toro's directing is very dynamic and this vintage halo around the movie makes it feels like a mix of Wes Anderson and Spielberg, fused with Amilie and vintage Parisien aesthetics mainly through the music to give this genre-defying romance. Besides, the story is remarkably touching too it's a reflection on loneliness as every characte suffer from it on his own terms from Elisa who's craving for love and being understood, to her friends Zelda who's living with a man who doesn't appreciate nor respect her and Jiles, an old gay guy who mourns not living his younger days fully and truly and afraid it's too late to find someone at his age, plus there is Strickland the antagonist, a depressed ex-soldier bored of his plastic life with a billboard plastic family and professor dimitri who's left out by the bothsides he's working for. They all keep living their monotonous routines until this aquatic God comes and changes it, as he represents closure and release, leading the characters to either find love, find confidence, stand up for themselves or simply find peace in death. The other thing that touched me the most is the love story between Elisa and the Creature as it defies words and norms only relying on feelings and touch, showing us that love is unconventional and universal and count on del Toro to deliver this beautiful message in a beautifully twisted way.",8,22,40,9 March 2018
There Will Be Blood," Master Piece
","'There are times when I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.'
' I want to make enough money that I can move far away from everyone.'This two lines struck me, they sum up the character and the persona of Daniel. if I could I would give this movie 6 stars on 5, a true masterpiece perfect in every way from the filming, framing of shots, the story, the acting, and characters..... duo to Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Thomas's genius. the movie started with 14.30 minutes dialogue-free introduction yet it's in my opinion, one of the best opening shots of cinema history. Daniel Day-Lewis is so perfect as Daniel Plainview SO PERFECT (what a surprise lol) that I hung up on every word and every silence of his, we saw him get the success and the solitude he craved for then saw him pay the price by losing his humanity and PT Anderson did such an outstanding job directing this movie that I couldn't lift my eyes from the screen during two and a half hours and it stuck with me with its poignant dark themes perfectly and subitly dilevered such as American ambition, family, religion, and Materialism. I can proudly say that this film is one of my best of all times.",10,0,0,30 January 2018
A Hard Day's Night," The Beatles success wasn't just about music, it's also due to 4 charming and delightful personalities:
","I really love this band you can't imagine how much. the Beatles are a big influence in my life and this since I discovered their music 5 years ago and you can't believe how thrilled I was while watching this movie. and It's not because of its realization, it had an average directing and production nor because it had a profound, multifaceted scenario or story, that's not what this movie is about nor what it's trying to achieve. what A hard day's night's attempting to do is give you an impression of this huge thing that is the Beatles, more essentially when they're not making music, and being normal goofy young men, it feels like being close to and hanging with them. and that's the reason I loved it since I was born ages after the band split and John died, and I was too young to remember Georges the only Beatles I caught up with are Ringo and Paul. so this movie really gives you a rendition of them and who they were. Plus that's not the main reason I liked it, the movie is full of wittiness and funny lines, and some subliminally smutty writing, not the one you'd expect from an early 60's movie and the band did a good job acting they were spontaneous and very attachable and the photography is enchanting and even if you get a little lost at the start because the story goes nowhere at the end it makes up for it with a great presence from the quartet and some transcendent music .",8,1,1,28 June 2018
Blade Runner," GOOD BUT...
","So based on this movie in one year we would have flying cars!?But first, I don't get why the replicants are considered as bad guys? Why does everyone wants to kill them, while they're just looking to live and they didn't ask to be alive at first place? Still, they ended up showing that they are as human if not more then the 'real humans' themselves especially at the finally. should Definitely give it a rewatch, even if it's a classic am going to be objective, I love the visual concept and its Neo-black aesthetics plus the references to the cyberpunk movement, the director's cut sheds more light on Rick Deckard nature and reinforces the movie's theme and its questioning of human nature although it was slow and full of talking with almost zero action, but its bigger flow is that it lacked a danger factor making some parts boring and hard to follow. even so, it's full of positive points too the main one is the use of music I love and appreciate Vangelis compositions and his use of Arabic music, a sound that added depth something this movie lacked especially in the characters and contrasted the anxious future Rick Deckard lived in, plus giving to this movie its iconic identity and sound.",7,2,4,26 January 2018
Annihilation," A true thought provocative movie!
","I truly enjoyed it, this is one of the most perplexing and thought-provoking movies I've ever seen, it has too many lectures, and none of them cancels the other It will take forever to tackle them all. And even if it's filled with some weird moments like the bear stealing voices and the humans transforming to plants ( the plants growing out from Josie was pretty uncomfortable to watch my body was shivering), it's still a fantastic movie about evolution, human nature and mental health. The Shimmer the film can have many interpretations: extraterrestrial or spiritual but the metaphor that comes over and is more accurate is Cancer which is mentioned at the beginning at college then inside the shimmer plus Ventress suffers from it, and Cass's daughter died of leukaemia. The shimmer Work almost like Cancer as it deconstructs the DNA of cells and mutates them, but rather than destroying, it evolves them causing the deletion of the old identity and the creation of a more sophisticated one, and this is the central theme of the movie in my opinion. As it interrogates the limits of this identity asking until which level of evolution do we stay ourselves? The shimmer creates chaotic life formes in constant change, the opposite of death which is an anomaly as Lena mentioned that would make the shimmer's interference on organisms 'life'. But in reality, the anomaly is our rejection to change and evolution, so the metaphor is a metaphor for human change and the 'destruction for building' moto. Another message that touched me in this movie is: choose' fight.' in the face of sorrow and misfortune! And this is the intake on mental illness as every character suffers on his way against there demons and the situation and only the one who chose to move forward and fight 'the thing' made it out of this grey and aguish zone while others lost their lives.",8,2,5,31 March 2018
