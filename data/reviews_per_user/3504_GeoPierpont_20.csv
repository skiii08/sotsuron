Catch Me If You Can," Perfect Light Entertainment
","enjoyed this sanguine film immensely despite the Spielberg saccharine confluence... how believable was the plot portrayed? hmmmmm, knowing others who pulled off some major impersonation heists more probable but the pace and typical overkill of 'whew, missed him by this much' is troublesome... Walken in a wonderful sympathetic role was my reward to take it all in without hesitation on first viewing.... Hanks unremarkable in the duality of his love/hate for Frankie... many laughable moments unexpected i.e. university of Ben Casey and Perry Mason, table blessing of the two mice, knock knock joke, prostitute paying customer, Ian Fleming fitting, necklace recovery, not Lutheran?, french class substitute, to name a few... perhaps only 50% of the 80% claimed by the real Frank for the events in this film is enough to impress and I was... loveliest scene of Judy Garland's Embraceable You kitchen sway with Martin and wife, ahhhh vive l'amore!! high recommend for chase thrillers in world wide locales, cheering for the bad guy theme with happy endings, Steven knows what most of us want.... kudos!",7,2,4,9 December 2013
Casablanca," For the Corrupt Poor
","What a cast of characters, if you are familiar with the careers of the major and minor leads, this is old school film buff heaven! I treasure a delicious intrigue and Casablanca delivers on all fronts. There is the foreign affairs effect, tense drama, fear filled moments, historical references, comedy, music, and a conflicted romance. For 1942 or thereabouts, not much competition imho.My major issue lies with the semblance of a decision for Ilsa regarding leaving her husband. Who could ever find this a plausible plot given she is already married, in love with the cause, comprehends her role in it, and deeply admires him since childhood. I did not find anything believable in a suspense ending given the aforementioned elements, but only the possible Nazi confrontation before the plane departure. The unexpected one liners were truly hilarious amidst the tense drama of escapes, persecution and liberation. The many representations of foreigners aligned as allies was inspiring, to wit the German vs French hit parade performance. I had not heard 'La Marseillaise' since High School and was impressed I was able to recall so many lines. Although many consider this a propaganda film, it accomplishes this with subtlety. The drop of the Vichy water bottle in the trash bin hints at the power of many countries aligned to defeat the Axis.High recommend for foreign war POV, star performances, life in French Morocco, and a black and white blue parrot.",8,0,2,9 April 2015
A Star Is Born," Great Music
","Have seen all versions but I think I like this one the best. Why? The music is magical, endearing and catchy. I am still singing the Shallow song today and will for awhile. The singers, esp. Gaga, are strong and virile with great performance vibes. I doubt there would be that much canoodling in front of a massive live audience but the camera leads you to believe it's just us. The pacing never drags and it was delightful to see Sam Elliott, Dave Chapelle and others in minor roles. Watching on a small screen, had some issues with the garage scene, but overall good direction and smooth transitions between scenes. Watching a second time enjoyed the music even more but it does lose a bit of luster given the attraction of Lady GaGa dims. Recommend to complete the series.",8,0,0,8 October 2019
500 Days of Summer," Zoey REALLY Does Have Pretty Eyes!
","That is my takeaway from this moronic film: Zoey has gorgeous eyes. Other than that I guess you are on your own for entertainment. The script and acting are so un-prolific all you can do is make sure you do something productive like opening your stacked up mail.Who comes up with this crap btw? Even if this is your very first film you have seen after Ms. Right just dumped your sorry ass, it is a complete waste of time. When a man is in pain, let alone a woman, who wants to see such a schlomo wimp garden of limp lillies going at it?High recommend for those who cannot get enough of banal dialogue and no chemistry between leads and most of all the SMYTHS!! AVOID",2,2,4,2 December 2015
Midnight in Paris," Hemingway Anyone?
","I made the mistake of respecting online reviews for this film and delayed watching for some time. However, I liked the idea of time travel in Paris and thought perhaps the reviews were misleading and over critical. Wow, was I right in that assessment!!If you have any notion of the music, art and literary genius of the '20s, Paris intrigue, and fantasy, this film is definitely for you. I was swept up in the concept and did not digress into the explicit formalities of complicated technical issues clearly ignored in this film.I enjoyed the excitement of anticipation of interaction with so many illustrious artists and philosophers and invited discourse of who, when and where I would prefer to explore. This era probably fits the bill for most and addresses mostly romantic gestures of vague recall to move the plot along.I am a futurist and spend little time thinking about what period I would like to visit in the past. Perhaps hanging out with Amelia Earhart on her last voyage, or Patton on his quest to quell Hitler's war machine? I am reminded of the remark by Owens that the past is not quite as romantic with the concept of lack of antibiotics. Only ONE effective reminder that is most sobering about a yearning for simpler times.The ubiquitous guitar riff used incessantly throughout the film was extremely annoying but not more so than McAdam's portrayal of a high maintenance bride. Hard to ignore but when midnight strikes all is forgiven when the true adventure ensues. The arbitrary voyage to 'La Belle Epoque' was unexpected and further complicated the plot to appreciate a bygone era but did serve to exploit the imagination on why so many view the past with such reverence.Many of my friends claim that the 50's were the Golden Era. Bolderdash I proclaim! Did they forget about how smoking was encouraged as seXy? And so many women just wanting to get married and never contribute to society or the family income? Or, well you get the idea, rainbows and lollipop thinking.I am so pleased that this type of intellectual (well vs current offerings) script is mainstream and available to us who crave mental stimulation. I highly recommend this film for the many fantasy elements, Francophiles, and sumptuous scenes that excite beyond convention.Bravo Mr. Allen for bringing such joy to the silver screen!!!",8,0,0,10 March 2017
Oblivion," Ping Pong Ball Bad Guys only LIGHTER!
","Spaceballs, a sci-fi comedy, has nothing on this masterpiece. I could not stop laughing when the drones appeared, who came up with this visual, let alone the R2D2 sounds? The super high tech TeT Commander can't even get a decent transmission and was always on the 'fritz. I loved Melissa Leo, what a departure from her typical Southern sweetness, oh wait...Tommy had me at 'Risky Business' and his performance fell just as flat. Apologies, I know how hard you work at your craft. Maybe when you are 60 we can get a little more lateral motion.Olga HotBabe is stunning with so many head shots of her emoting, er sleeping, and were beautiful. I am guessing she is the new Angelina, but no comparison on the acting level, she just seemed scared and uncomfortable during the film. Can hardly blame her sidling up to the Big Boys.The scene that provided the highest entertainment value was the Scav Torture Chamber. Now, when you are desperate for a drone flyer and there is only ONE, what do you do? You smash him to bits, tie him up, flame the Draqnet bright lights on him and recite poetry, gots to end on a polite note. My friends, it doesn't get any better than this.Enjoyed the Zep tune on the grassy knoll, and other musical inputs. However, the sound was so disjointed, i.e. dialog barely a whisper, action scenes cranked up 1000%, constantly had to adjust the volume, unclear if that was an editing problem.I guess the crowning achievement is that our man hooks up with two major hotties, take that Katy! Recommend for pure comedy, especially if you are a big sci-fi fan.",5,0,0,3 December 2014
American Psycho," Harken Back to the Olden Days of BlockBuster
","If you ever coveted a copy of 'Dress for Success' as your personal Bible or were captivated by a critical analysis of Whitney Houston or Huey Lewis's artistic efforts, this is a definitive moment captured on celluloid.Christian Bale of 'Little Women' fame ascends a slight departure from the loving, kind, gentle soul but retains that 'I Want to Fit In!' at any cost mentality in this role. I hailed all those many stereotypes, defiled in every scene and found the character hilarious.Yes, he felt trapped and subjected to lower life forms while comparing watermarks on business cards and the ability to obtain the rare reservation at the latest Phenom restaurant. Who wouldn't lose their mind in this shallow, chasing shadows, meaningless existence? Here, we have an exceptionally sensitive and caring soul who just cannot bear one more moment of the herd mentality and cracks under pressure.This was a divine commercial for Men's beauty products and regimen to achieve the look of perfection and charm. Such an erudite perspective of a clandestine approach to coping in the material world. Albeit, an unusual take that leaves one gasping for air, but perhaps for naught.An additional viewing to appropriately review this title is required, but taking chances never did anyone much harm hence, this effort. I found the direction remarkable and parlayed many layers of complexity beyond shallow characters. The color schemes, pacing, scene caressing and framing compiled the true stars of this show.High recommend for Christian fans, he is absolutely gorgeous, stunning, beautiful and full of promise. Jared Leto has an infinitesimal role yet memorable. Prepare for fantasy blood and gore and the pen-ultimate career of 'Murders and Executions'.",7,0,0,22 March 2016
Hugo," Fantastic for Five Minutes!
","I decided to watch this for several reasons: Jude Law, Martin Scorcese, Sir Ben, and superlative reviews. At onset, I had great enthusiasm with the opening scene phasing into reality with sumptuous visuals and engaging, intricate set composition. This led me to believe wondrous adventure lies beneath, ala Harry Potter style. However, after a very short time, I was supremely disappointed in the plot, acting, and dialogue. Being long on patience for exposition, there was limited reward at film's end.I actually fell asleep waiting for something interesting to happen. If only the Automaton could liven up more than once, I would have been pleased. Literally too much smoke and mirrors to my great annoyance.Cohen's performance, a Peter Sellers wannabe, was exceedingly bad. Marty typically hires phenomenal talent, but this hack was the height of horror, scene after scene. Disheartening when I recall the very first home made Scorcese movie and loved even that simple effort.I could not fathom a child being able to sit through this drivel although I found the history of film fascinating. This was the only redeeming feature of this effort which piqued my interest. I recently viewed a documentary on the debate of digital vs celluloid and appreciated Marty's input as very thoughtful and honest. It is unclear if that production was filmed prior to this project, but I highly recommend that he stick with his previous formula which has satisfied billions to date.High recommend for introduction of pioneer George Melies' films, rich visual context, and to complete the catalog of Scorcese projects.",4,1,2,1 October 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Tragic Reminder of Not Too Long Ago
","I worked as an AIDS Hospice Volunteer in the 90's and seeing firsthand the despair and loneliness experienced by these victims helped identify with the characters portrayed in this film. Extremely moving story with exceptional performances provided an educational and inspiring vehicle for audiences worldwide.The transformation of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto was alarming as they were nearly unidentifiable. The dedication to their craft seemed unhealthy and did not feel these extremes were necessary to convey the plot. Matthew's take on this role hovered on overly theatrical which sometimes invalidated the plight of his character. Tone it down darlin'. Leto on the other hand totally nailed Rayon and he sure does make quite an impression of beauty, tragedy, and compassion.The availability of medical information on HIV/AIDS at that time was so restricted and limited, it was a testament of the will to survive that he overcame his death sentence for seven years. I am not aware of all the facts behind the scenes but know of many others with Chronic Illness who became their own advocate in researching treatments outside of conventional methods to pursue cures or improve quality of life. A sad disheartening statement is presented that demonstrates the divergent paths of Big Pharma and the lone patient desperate for help.The LGBT community was extremely organized and powerful in achieving great strides to provide access to drugs that addressed this illness. I would have liked to see more of how they impacted the success of their plight for assistance however, the main character was not in this category so perhaps more emphasis would be inconsistent.It was gratifying to see a gradual acceptance by a straight man of the LGBT community despite his profit motive. There is much room for improvement even at this date. Overall, an inspiring look at one man's mission to overcome FDA, IRS, and DEA regulations to help his fellow sufferers. High Recommend.",8,1,1,18 November 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Courtisane au Chocolat Recipe Please!
","Location, Location, Location! But of what? The Boy With Apple painting? That MacGuffin should have been at least akin to modern abstract, as to avoid distraction in comparison with renowned masterpieces. The painting appeared rank amateur and found it wanting for such a coveted prize.Now onto that pastry! It looked so succulent and mouthwatering, I have never seen a comparable creation, it would provide immense gratification after enduring this film. I was rather bored for the most part and when pastry items ignite my interest, it does not bode well for a great review.I was unaware of the plot, script, actors involved, or reviews, so went in with an objective mindset. I was astounded with the number of high profile talent appearing in surprising roles that, after the aforementioned pastry, I anticipated who would show up next. I recently watched Ed Norton in 'Fight Club' and seeing him dressed in gestapo gear provided some much needed hilarity! The beautiful vistas from precarious positions were breathtaking and filled many weary scripted scenes. I imagine that a significant portion of the budget was dedicated to talent which translates to an insufferable script. The directing was plodding and predictable but hard to hit all four cylinders in this type of 'I already knew who done it' farce.Recommend for notorious compilation of similar scripts with a new twist: include every A-Lister alive and voila, exasperating formula!",6,1,4,18 January 2015
Donnie Brasco," Artificial Suspense Overuse
","I have not read the book but understand Pistone was undercover for six years vs two. How the FBI could expect a family to stay together under these difficult circumstances is unconscionable. The compensation appears relatively dismal compared to the life risking role expected of it's agents.However, this did make for an excellent portrayal of the many subtle intrigues of remaining in good favor with criminal elements. I enjoyed the New York City street scenes and emphasis on a family life with fellow mobsters and how they seemed to care, unless of course they were 'sent for'.I noticed too many scenes were artificially created to induce suspense to see whether they uncovered the rat, and when and if they were going to kill Donnie. After you see it once, you definitely notice the annoying dialogue to make you think it could happen at any second, when nothing was further from the truth.The treatment of Donnie by Lefty seemed insincere when he was clearly aware of the great potential of his newest ward. I thought there would have been more teasing and chiding than outright insulting insipid remarks. This detracted from the reality of how many people back east act towards each other.The transformation of Agent Pistone to Donnie Brasco was very well done. He managed to alter many aspects of speech, gait, motions, and reactions. Depp is a respectable ally to Pacino's Lefty.High recommend for discovering a unique layer of an undercover agent's life and it's repercussions both emotionally and in the criminal world.",6,9,13,9 March 2015

","i watch a lot of silent films which evoke many emotions, well done, acted genuinely and great camera angles....but this movie is a pos... i can barely review it given my disdain for carp... i will admit that the girl had a huge beautiful grin and the dog was charming... no one who watches all forms of film could endure this but i actually did because i cannot review a film without fairly seeing it to the end... i waited several years to see this and was soooo excited to see it was available on tcm.com and was ready to settle in for some incredible entertainment given all the accolades and awards...whiskey tango fox",2,8,12,7 March 2015
Eyes Wide Shut," Repeat After Me like 1000 times....OY VEY!
","turn off the sound and only then can you manage to appreciate the visuals in this film, they are outstanding, if you do not, you will hear dialog and tinker toy piano notes over and over like molasses in January.... kidmans' soliloquy is the highlight and centerpiece of the drama and first time ever imo to expose what transpires in a womans fantasy world with men, at least the passion for something intense is portrayed but it ends there, 'cept maybe the homework example of addition/subtraction.... it did make me long for the nyc lifestyle, life in LA makes you feel stranded and devoid of stimulating experiences... no comparison on the lighting and sets, mega kudos to the DP and set director, impeccable, inscrutable, inspiring.... the women were just too thin and gangly to suggest lust perhaps with the exception of the junkie hooker, she had perfect proportions but all you get is an OD, morgue scene, and a peek of a catwalk... bored to death as I require more than visuals, will see Disney's Fantasia for that, hence, a high recommend for beginning piano players of 3yo and under, LeeLee's first appearance and in cute undies, party planners for conceptual lighting configurations and Tom in a gold sequin mask ala Vanilla Sky....meh",3,1,3,7 October 2013
12 Years a Slave," The Passion of Platt
","As a former northerner I knew something was amiss at the get go in this film. Have you ever been to Philadelphia, recently? The Saratoga News clips mentioned in other reviews cite such a dramatically different account of this main characters plight as to almost be seen as terrorism. The incite to riot appears to be the main goal of this film and I found it appalling. With every scene, a white southerner, and don't forget to include those evil women as well this time around, was grimacing with delight to defile, defeat, and attempt to kill their chattel. Does that make any sense when you want productivity?I thought 'Gone With the Wind' was racist and after watching this horror film, I redefined the term. It is completely irresponsible for the Producers to have funded this effort. The 'Passion of Christ' I could only watch using the option for the blind captions. But I found I did not have the stomach to complete this even worse aberration of film. The music of dread, scary drumbeats, and overall cruelty were incessant undertones to further complete the torture saga. I pray the truth about this man's account comes to bear and that those so affected to further indemnify the South will balance their views with more accuracy. I am horrified this film was an award winning, highly acclaimed manipulation of history to exploit for profit. Slavery is alive and well today and is a serious threatening global issue. Perhaps this debate will highlight a topic for the next award winning effort. God Bless!",1,13,23,13 November 2014
The Reader," 'The Graduate': Germany Style
","Trying to think of the right word to summarize my reaction to this film. I got it...STUPID! Who in their right mind would give up their life in prison because they had pride? Hmmmm, only someone with room temp IQ. You see Hanna delicately washing her young lover in the bath. Why? It was for her pleasure. She was not capable of seeing past anything but her own satisfaction which certainly did not produce pleasurable results. Who would make a short term decision despite long term consequences? Stupidity!I did what I was told, I did not think, ya think? This was a horrible mess and to make it even worse was the reaction of the daughter whose mother died in the fire. She is still wanting revenge for this deplorable act and shows no mercy or even compassion for STUPIDITY! I have so many issues with this film, save for the acting skills of the three leads. They were superb!I saw this film twice with a good time in between to present a more fair assessment. However, I am even more upset over the lack of credible themes, plot, and impressions. What is there to ponder after watching this film? My opinion claims very limited value.High recommend for the young lad and ol' blue eyes. QED",3,0,0,1 April 2015
Jaws," A Cruise Ship??? too hilarious....
","When I saw that Cruise Ship try to dock on the HUGE Port of Call called Amityville I knew I was in for the typical Spielberg treat.... i.e. almost slipping, almost killed, dumbed down dialogue, almost drowning, electrocuted, you know the 'missed it by that much' element that is presented, oh let's say every 11 seconds.... does Vegas cover a bet like that, hmmmmm Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!! Ever seen a fake shark chew a 5lb pack of Bazooka Joe Bubble Gum??? Well you are in for a treat and as luck would have it, this fishie is going for the big blow, haven't laughed so hard in ages, Steven you darling, should have been on the DVD cover! Honestly, I have great admiration for the articulate and smooth move grammatical structure reviews, but regurgitating the entire script and blatantly white washing the entire film is most irritating. Thank you to the low star reviewers who lack respect for drivel driven cinema.Loved Robert Shaw with his soliloquys and poems, and the best facial reaction from Roy seeing that huge chunk of cheese or silly putty (your choice), bravo!!! ;}}",2,3,20,22 December 2013
Windtalkers," Who's the Soldier with the Brad Pitt Hair???
","What a disservice to Italians from South Philly! I watched this film between TWO other war movies and every single time I tuned in, all I could view was this supernatural flying circus with fireworks proudly displayed. The Script in the Crypt Keeper was working furiously overtime. NOT!I truly wanted to decipher ;}} more about the Navajo culture and how they may have influenced the average white supremacist, and what an education! NOT!Why would their most precious cargo be forced to hit the front lines for such extended time frames. For example, I recall orders to head up this 99d incline with bombs flaring through the tree line and see 'waz up'. Very sensible game plan. NOT! Let's face it I was not there, but catch a few Duke war flicks and you will see, albeit, a more sanitized version, but so much more watchable and entertaining.When I saw the cutaway scene of one soldier with hair highlights, bleach tips and shining bangs over his eyes, I laughed so hard and thought this had to be intentional. Was this film an attempt at comedy? Please tell me affirmative sir yes sir! NOT!Just watching scene after agonizing scene with good ol' St. Nick with his pained expressions, and that lovely blood gurgling from his lips in many different congealment configurations, also gave me a clue that Woo is WooWoo.Thanks for the history lesson and a high five for the commercials!",2,0,2,24 April 2014
Sully," The Sully: Grey Goose in Water
","Having experience with complex simulations, I find it so difficult to believe they would not share any parameters used with the actual defendants due to media leaks! Not believable but would have an attorney present if true.The sequencing of this film was disjointed and was in need of just a couple of sub-titles to let us know the time frame, location, and relative significance. I was never confused but those that did not consume main stream media during this event may need some help with connecting the dots.I would highly recommend that the flight attendants come up with something more instructional and less elusive than the term Brace! What the hell does that mean, who even uses that terminology, and other than feel scared as F it does not help at all to assist frantic scared passengers. I live very close to LAX and sometimes late at night they change the flight path directly over my head and is so loud my windows vibrate. Seeing this film makes me even more worried that something like this could happen right in my neighborhood. Good Grief!I have adored Tom Hanks since 'Big' and imho he can do no wrong. Seeing interviews with the real Sully makes me think he did a perfect capture of his calm, cool, and collected nature. Bravo my friend! I felt most proud of this accomplishment by a seasoned pilot, who else could have pulled this off, Gordon Cooper?High recommend for Clint's attempt to recreate the entire rescue scene, amazing! And the lovely sense that GOD exists and whatever force that is, protected 155 lives on the Hudson. AMEN",8,0,1,7 May 2017
The Wizard of Oz," WOW! Huge Free Range Pasture Fed Chickens....YUM
","After viewing this film countless times, I never appreciated the healthy vibrant appearance of the farm animals vs what I currently see in local farms as well as on dinner plates. Those chickens were positively show material! A testament to the type of food quality available to the average farmer prior to Monsanto, CAFO, Fukishima, pollution and other unhealthy means to achieve higher production and subsequent profits.Attempts to locate clean food in this world is a great challenge and never more evident than my noticing this fact while watching a children's fantasy film from the 1930's as a salient noteworthy element.Have enjoyed the film immensely throughout adult life and although the 'there's no place like home' morality falls on deaf ears in this age, it remains an entertainment piece with no rival.High recommend for Garland fans with her lilting subtle sultry tone that perhaps only Durbin could exceed. Caution to the little ones for the dramatization of evil that make fodder for nightmares!",6,2,9,2 February 2014
