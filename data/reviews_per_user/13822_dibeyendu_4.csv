First Man," Sound Effects Are The Main Thing
","The film opens with a bewilderingly long sequence of Neil Armstrong on a test flight, everything shaking, loud noises. I didn't know what to make of it. Then there's Mr Armstrong back on land, with his family. After a while there are more spaceship scenes, with loud roars and clanking sounds. It then dawned on me that these special sound effects were at the core of the movie and I should appreciate them. And so I did, right till the moon landing at the, which is also a protracted screen shake. But really, getting you to feel what it must be like inside a space ship landing on the moon is not enough to make for an enjoyable movie. Indeed, it makes for an incredibly pointless and boring movie. Sad.",3,3,7,16 October 2018
Star Trek Into Darkness," Hi-tech, low-tech
","The latest Star Trek is a wonderful combination of high tech and low tech. This time around, people don't coldly zap each other with guns. They have brutal fist fights atop flying vehicles (a la the opening scene in Skyfall). The movie begins with a wonderful low tech meets high tech sequence where Starship Enterprise is hidden in the sea on a planet that's about see a major volcano eruption that will wipe out its population. Spock goes into the erupting volcano to stop it with a cold fusion device which is set to consume him as well. But then, Captain Kirk gives the order to fly the Enterprise to the volcano and rescue Spock, even if it means exposing the starship to the people of the planet, who still live in the stone ages. That's against the rules and Kirk gets punished for it back on earth -- he's relieved of his command. But's that's just the first ten minutes of this terrific movie, where the pace never lets up. There's lots of sci-fi, but the human interest is equally high. The friendship between Kirk and Spock is played up to an extent that it begins to seem like a romance ! In this, the film is like an Indian movie. All that's missing is the songs.",10,3,20,15 May 2013
Legend," Black Comedy Par Excellence
","I loved director Brian Helgeland first movie 'Payback,' starring Mel Gibson and I expected I would enjoy 'Legend' too. And I certainly did. Like 'Payback,' 'Legend' is a dark comedy at heart. There are scenes here where I laughed out loud, like the one where Ronnie Kray informs his American mafia counterpart that he's gay, taking pains to describe his sexuality in some length. This was the 1960s, where gays were referred to as 'faggots,' and the look on the mafioso's face as he's being told all this is priceless. Then there's the scene where Ronnie Kray behaves badly with the guests at the Kray brother's night club. When Reggie gets back from his stint in prison, the only ones in the club on a Friday night are his gang members. When you're making a movie on two murderous gangsters I guess it's best you keep the treatment light and not take them too seriously. Another recent movie called Dark Mass starring Johny Depp took itself too seriously and suffered as a result. In the end end, they were stupid gangsters and there's no point getting into your knickers into a twist over whether they look glamorous on film or not. Like 'Payback', 'Legend' has a certain look and feel and the artwork and cinematography are excellent. Tom Hardy in a dual role is great too as are the supporting cast. Yes, it's hard to catch the dialogue sometimes, but that's not a major issue.",10,3,5,7 December 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," Visual delight
","This movie is a visual delight. A lot of the action takes place in art galleries with beautiful sculptures in the background. It's not for nothing that it's set in New York and Rome, two world fashion centers. One of the best sequences is inside some sort of Roman ruin. Too beautiful for words! The first John Wick was thoroughly enjoyable, but I didn't expect the sequel to be even better. Mind you, the starting is a bit lopsided, trying to connect you to what happened in the first chapter. But this movie really starts after the titles and shoots off from there. One thinks one might get tired of all the shooting and killing and dead bodies in this film, but one doesn't. The length of the action sequences is just right. And like in Chapter One, Keanu Reeves plays John Will as an assassin on auto pilot, with no time to think, only to act. Can't wait for Chapter 3!",10,3,8,6 March 2017
