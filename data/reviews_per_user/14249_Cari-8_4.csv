Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas has so much to tell, but so little time.
","I admit to being vaguely disappointed with Episode 1. The concepts are excellent, the effects are without equal and it has a beautiful score of remarkable intensity.  So why was I disappointed?Admittedly, this is a massive undertaking, and a challenge to even a fine and experienced director like Lucas.  The result, unfortunately, is that watching Episode 1 is like trying to tour the Smithsonian in 3 hours-- there's just too much to cover to do it thoroughly and really appreciate everything.  Due to this sometimes breakneck pace, our heroes are denied the opportunity to develop any real bond.  Somehow, this lessens the overall impact of the film.  True, extraordinary things are happening (in all their CG glory), but how do we feel about the outcome?  We are forced to establish our connection with the central figures based on what we know from the original trilogy. For those interested in learning more about the souls and histories of the characters, I would recommend the book (although even the book falls a little short in some areas).  I did find the film entertaining overall, but it somehow lacked the heart of the originals.  I will, however, still go to the theater when Episode 2 arrives, hoping for a little more.",Null,0,1,16 August 1999
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Perfectly over the top, just like any good cartoon should be...
","It's rare to have such a high profile production that keeps the appeal of a cult classic, and even more rare to have a movie come out with such hype that actually lives up to our expectations.  The visual effects are excellent, and the story is a prime lampoon of the classic film noir private detective stories of the time...in short, it works! Hoskins is great as our troubled gumshoe, Cassidy does her tough-as-nails Tess Trueheart best as his girl, Christopher Lloyd as Doom is almost more of a cartoon than the cartoons are... perfectly over the top, as always.  Kathleen Turner turns out a sultry femme fatale worthy of Barbara Stanwyck, and manages to keep that heart of gold hidden (beneath that bosom, how difficult can it be?)... And, of course, there's Roger, voiced by the remarkable Charles Fleischer (who also voiced Benny the Cab, Greasy and Psycho).  No one but Fleischer could have played this character!  This is the perfect cartoon rabbit, the ultimate hapless hero...a lover, not a fighter, and funny, too!It's a great movie for any age--like the old WB cartoons, adults will appreciate it on a completely different level than kids will.",Null,0,0,20 July 1999
Mississippi Burning," A tale of the Civil Rights movement, told in a way no textbook ever could.
","Populated with a cast of some of the heaviest hitters in Hollywood, this film is incredibly powerful.  It never pulls a punch from frame one...you feel every bit of fear, anger, pain, frustration and outrage that radiates from the screen.   Hackman and Dafoe are remarkable as the two FBI agents Ward and Anderson...the tension between them is completely believable. Yet the most outstanding performances are given by two of the finest chameleon actors around; Frances McDormand (who garnered an Oscar for this film) and Brad Dourif (Oscar nominee for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), both of whom are so complete in their work that it actually takes a moment to recognize them--you forget they are actors.  This cast managed to tell a difficult story about a difficult time and never once did the characters become caricatures.Look also for a moving performance by a  young Darius McCrary who later became Eddie Winslow of Family Matters fame.",9,1,1,19 July 1999
Pocahontas," A fairy tale, not a historical tale, but kids will enjoy it.
","Pocahontas is a beautifully scored and  breathtakingly animated movie. The songs were lovely, Irene Bedard was moving and sincere. So why was I so disappointed?  Perhaps because I live within walking distance of the Jamestown National Historical Site and Jamestown Settlement.  Perhaps because I know that the animators spent many months doing extensive research on the sites and then ignored much of it. If you come to visit, you'll see Jamestown is beautiful, but don't expect the sweeping vistas and towering cliffs, and certainly don't expect to see any moose wandering around (we're a little far South for that)!  Bring your children to see the real story if you can...or at least read the real story to them...it's just as interesting as the Disney version, but less marketable.How disappointed was I?  I went out and rented 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' afterward.And by the way guys...if you light the fuse on a gun and jump through a waterfall, chances are it's not going to fire.",Null,4,6,5 August 1999
