The Avengers," extravaganza for a particular audience
","this film is for young school kids, teenagers, or young adults w/ penchant for comic books heroes. It will not do a lot of good for viewers who expect quality in acting, serious plot and dramatic ending w/ special after-effect. Sci-fi battle/actions and latest special effects (and equipment) having no real stand-out personality (you can see from the talk) amount to not much for one to remember the movie about in the line of many other movies that fall in the same footsteps; that is, this action intense extravaganza will be forgotten very quick; even with its attempt to insert some (kid-level) comic events along the way. The movie does not deserve 7 stars nor does it fall into a 6 category since its making suggests or dictates achievement of visual/cinematographic effects of some level, all of which clearly worth of some praise, IMO.",7,2,7,25 June 2012
Prometheus," ALIEN's aware folks: half spoiled
","the original 'ALIEN' contains not only the better script and originality in all characters, and is topped w/ sci-fi substance, and suspenseful and climactic ending. This 'Prometheus' title bears nothing exotic that promises effects of thrill, creativeness coupled with clarity in terms of the script, or portent of any cinematographic virtuoso, and this lack of imaginativeness can be seen in the non-communicative aspect of the film in terms of its non-unified sequence/scenario amounting to a non-climax that would fail to captivate the viewers the same way the 20-year past movie did; that is, the 'ALIEN' masterpiece this title tries to imitate. If you enjoyed (or are half-spoiled with) the original 'Alien', be prepared or get ready to lower your expectations, as this film will disappoint, except for one bright spot played by the main character; and even this character does not achieve much in leaving the viewer with lingering (positive) effects when the viewer is walking out of the theater.",6,2,2,25 June 2012
