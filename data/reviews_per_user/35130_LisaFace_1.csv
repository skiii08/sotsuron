Insidious: Chapter 2," Uninspiring and dull
","If watching actors walk around rooms filled with dry ice and people with lots of makeup on screaming at them is your thing then this movie should be right up your street.The acting is substandard. The plot line confused and boring. The special effects laughable. This franchise should have been left with only one film, as unfortunately there just isn't enough material to make a compelling sequel. The original film, whilst a bit silly in parts, did manage to conjure up some good scares and jumps, whereas this attempt just lacked any kind of entertainment whatsoever.Lets just pray there isn't going to be a part 3.",1,6,10,21 August 2014
