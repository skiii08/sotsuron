Alien 3," Underrated? Overrated more like!
","I really can't see why some people think this film was underrated. The imagery is offensive to the eye, not suspenseful or 'dark.' The action is mind-numbingly boring, and inexcusably the wonderfully talented Pete Postlethwaite barely gets a look in! The camera effects are impressive, but the computer generated Alien is terrible. It amazes me why Sigourney Weaver ever agreed to star in a sequel to this awful film. So there!",Null,385,411,11 April 1999
Minority Report," Flawed almost-masterpiece
","I really liked this film. Though it can't match Blade Runner for mixing stunning sci-fi locations and gadgetry with intellectual muscle, it at least has a good shot at being clever and thought-provoking whilst remaining accessible and exciting.As you'd expect from Dick, the plot is heavily focused on the idea of personal privacy and how far the government should be allowed to intrude on people's lives.  The first half has a few scenes which contain some interesting metaphysics and good dialogue.The second half loses this, which is unfortunate, and instead turns into a fairly standard and predictable but very well-made action thriller. The chase sequences are smart and exciting, the special effects range from very good to stunning, and the pacing is about right. The plot twists and turns pretty nicely, with a few moments of real unpredictability, though as I said most of it is pretty predictable. It's mostly free of the kind of vomit-inducing sentimentality that ruined AI, though Spielberg's new-found grit and dark sense of humour do waver a bit towards the end.The acting's solid and the script tight and mostly believable, so all in all I'd say this is certainly worth watching and I'll probably buy the DVD.",9,0,0,9 July 2002
Akira," Great animation and not as confusing as many say
","The most striking thing about Akira is the superb animation, which is full of detail and is surprisingly smooth considering that this is an Anime. The sound is also very impressive, being extremely powerful and emotive at times. I can't understand why people find this film so confusing (WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!). It's simple: There's this supernatural force called Akira (named after the boy who first possessed it), and it's been discovered by the japanese government. They are running secret tests on individuals to see if they can create a kind of human superweapon. Tetsuo, who is already pretty annoyed at the world, is tested on but the test is too successful, resulting in an extremely bitter young man with the power to destroy whole bridges with his mind. Then he slowly self-destructs until the finale, where his power overtakes him and he goes into oblivion(?). Sure it's fairly complex but it ain't THAT bad!So, overall, I give Akira 9/10",Null,1,3,19 November 2001
Alien: Resurrection," A hell of a lot better than Alien 3 but worse than Aliens...
","I actually really liked this film. OK, so Ripley's characterisation was a bit off and the first half an hour was boring, but once it got going the action was fast and intense and the script was pretty good. It also has the most original plot of the series (apart from 1, of course.) The ending could have been better - although it was quite exciting, I'm getting bored of seeing Aliens being sucked out into space. Still, overall it was a very good film and I'd recommend that you at least rent it, if not buy it.",7,1,1,11 April 1999
Alien," Good, but over-hyped.
","I really had high hopes for this movie. I've seen the others and thoroughly enjoyed them (except Alien3), so I was sure this one would be a stunner. But it wasn't. There were some good bits, and plenty of tension, but I found myself getting bored between the special effects sequences. Oh well, it was worth watching, just not as good as I thought it would be.",Null,1,1,30 September 1999
The Shining," Brilliant, but has one HUGE flaw.
","This is a superb film - the pacing and suspense are just right, and the shocks come thick and fast in the last 45 minutes. However, there is a big flaw: It is never properly explained exactly why the lead character goes psycho. In the book it is because he is a reformed alcoholic who's just had his first drink in three years, and the hotel he is taking care of is playing with his mind. In the film, we are given a slight hint that he used to be an alcoholic, but not enough. We are just left confused when he suddenly goes mad a while later. As I said, though, it's a thoroughly scary and entertaining film.",6,1,3,9 May 1999
The Shining," Mind-wrenching
","This is THE scariest movie I've seen - even my teacher found it scary, and as we know, teachers don't have minds. Jack Nicholson is over-the-top but excellent. It's the only 'Shocker' movie that genuinely builds up a suspenseful atmosphere, to great effect.",6,0,3,10 January 1999
Aliens," Wearing
","This is great film, featuring the best non-stop action I've seen. I was positively worn out by the end of it! It's definitely more of an action movie than Alien, but it doesn't stray too far from its roots as a shocker (Alien 3 did, and was awful for it.)",10,1,2,10 January 1999
Independence Day," Shallow, awful plot, bad acting....but the FX are good!
","This is a very disappointing film. If you look behind the great CGI effects, there's no plot, a cliched script, some bad acting, and some incredibly stereotypical characters. Will Smith is good as ever, but even he can't make the awful lines sound much better. The whole film feels like an American PR campaign - it's all about gung-ho Americans defending the earth. OF course, the British guys are all stuck-up posh snobs.",4,12,27,5 October 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Pretty good
","This movie is pretty good as long as you don't try to think about it too much. Yes, it's flawed and yes the plot/characters are awful but still it's entertaining and worth renting. Much better on a big screen than on telly though.",3,0,7,13 December 2000
Jaws," Disappointing
","This has to be THE most disappointing film I've seen. Although the acting and direction are pretty good, I really can't see how an unconvincing mechanical shark can be scary. The music's good, though.",Null,1,4,10 January 1999
Scream," Overrated
","This is the most overrated film I've seen! Yeah, it's OK, but it's nowhere near the great movie everyone seems to think it is. The direction is good, but the plot is boring and the characters too annoying to care about. I have a shocking revalation to make: THE PLOT WAS NICKED! Anyone who has seen Black Christmas will agree that the plots are identical - it's just the characters and setting that are different. Even the twist at the end is the same. Having said this, the way the movie takes the p*ss out of the horror genre is good.",5,2,6,21 July 1999
Blade Runner," Sheer class.
","This movie is great. The acting is spot-on and the special FX stand up brilliantly even today. Harrison Ford excels himself. It's also very moral - if you want an action flick, watch Terminator instead. This is more like Leon than Star Wars. A word of warning, though: If you see it, make sure you watch the Director's Cut version first, as it hasn't got the awful Hollywood-style ending. The ending line in the DC version is the most powerful yet - 'It's a pity she won't live. But then again, who does?'",10,0,0,8 February 1999
The Matrix," Very overrated
","A few weeks ago I took my Matrix DVD out of my collection and, because I was bored, decided to ring up my mate and tell him that either he takes it off me or I burn it. I had the matches ready and everything, and would have conducted a fascinating experiment into the effect of touching a DVD with a naked flame had he not agreed to let me give it to him. I kid you not.
This film is the worst waste of twenty quid I have ever bought. The psuedo-intelectual claptrap ('Hey, what if the world isn't real after all'???? Yawn, like I didn't already think of that when I was about five years old) is used to cover the fact that the main characters and large chunks of the plot were obviously, ahem, 'influenced by' William Gibson's classic pulp-sci-fi tale 'Neuromancer', ie. they are largely identical (including the role of each character within the narrative) but have had their names or skin colour changed. The visuals are quite pretty but again are totally lacking in innovation except for the 'Bullet Time' gimmick, which is fun to watch but not as impressive as had been made out. At least it wasn't over-used. Then we move onto the acting: Fishburne is fine, as is Moss, but Keanu drags the film into new depths of rubbishness with his trademark lack of emotion or even the slightest indication of sentience, ruining some lines that should sound great. Finally, the action sequences are well-choreographed but somehow seem flat, as if the pacing is a little off.I won't be going to see the sequels.",2,7,17,6 May 2002
Princess Mononoke," Just thought I'd add yet another good review
","OK, first of all this film does have flaws. It's sometimes overly sentimental and has very little philosophical depth. However, that's not a problem if you rate it as what it is - an epic hollywood-style adventure which is more about thrill than thought. It looks fantastic, with beautiful backdrops, some good (and sparing) use of CGI and that great stylized almost-but-not-quite-fluid animation that marks good anime apart from western animation. The storyline is engaging, and the characters likeable. Plus, it features battle sequences on a par with (or...dare I say it... more exciting than) Fellowship Of The Ring for sheer style and pace.  The english dub is pretty good, which makes a change, with all the actors seeming quite believable. The musical score is effective, though sometimes it veers into what my A-level film teacher called 'emotional fascism', i.e. it can be a little TOO overwhelming which won't appeal to those who don't like having their feelings dictated to them. On the whole, I'd give it...ohhhh...alright then, 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,30 September 2002
Jurassic Park," he should have stuck at what he knows best.
","Although the FX are great and the action reasonably exciting, I feel this movie definitely suffers from Steven Spielberg Syndrome. In other words, it tries to be shocking and exciting but also to remain mainstream by not going too far. The same thing happened with Jaws. There's shocks but no suspense, and action without 'too much' violence, and it doesn't really seem to know what sort of film it wants to be. Still, it's worth watching if only for the bit in the kitchens with the Velociraptors. PS. it's worth noting that Velociraptors were only the size of a Turkey!",Null,1,4,15 February 1999
Evil Dead II," Wow
","This has to be the finest horror-comedy film. Ever. It's full of movie in-jokes, deliberately-cheesy bits and some quite amazing camera shots. The most effective scenes are the point-of-view shots. At one point there is a HUGE P.O.V shot - there's something out there, it batters down trees and doors, smashes windows, breaks floorboards, sees Ash (the main character), chases him relentlessly for ages......then loses him, looks around puzzledly, and goes straight back out the way it came. The laughter comes just afterwards, as you realise just how pointless the last five minutes of film were.",10,0,0,28 September 1999
