Despicable Me 2," Whole is less than sum of the parts . . .
","This film was a series of sight, sound and writing gags that had almost no continuity, and while funny, did not result in a coherent narrative.The first Despicable Me suffered nearly the identical fate, but the parts of that whole were more robust and formidable - the cruel mother; the dastardly foe; the extreme crime; and just the novelty of all of the unusual imagery.Here? Each part was much reduced. Light laughter, a few LOLs, but zero engagement with the meager plot. I was never drawn into the story, because the story was just a bunch of slight laughs trying to operate as a plot.And isn't anyone going to comment on the notion of the female protagonist being a red-head named Lucy with her hair tied back in a bun? I mean, come on . . . . .",5,1,5,9 July 2013
The Avengers," C-minus
","With the high budget this film had, I should not be noticing the staging. 'OK, Mark, you stand there and look annoyed but knowing, Scarlett, look like you're pondering, Chris, focus on keeping some of the accent but not all of it . . . ' There was no scene in the film where I didn't see with my mind's eye the director on set barking stage direction. Perhaps if the script had been stronger, I wouldn't have noticed. But pair a weak script with a long series of obviously staged (and very non-dynamic) scenes, and you end up with more flat scenes than I can count. Character development: With this cadre of fun and interesting actors and the huge budget that hired them, you'd think you'd end up with quality oozing out of the screen. No. Robert Downey's Stark was one- note, snarkie, and that's it. A few fun lines, but zero cleverness and no depth. The same with the rest of them. Except for Mark R. and Scarlet J. They were the only two who created anything interesting with their parts - and of these two, Mark R. created a genuinely interesting character in Banner. CGI: Big budgets mean you shouldn't notice the CGI. In one scene in particular, it was obvious that the actors were in front of a green screen, with the CGI added later. They should blend into the CGI not stand apart and obviously in front of it. Script: Could the script have been more plodding and obvious? It was not a smart or clever script. It read like . . . a comic book! Perhaps that's all Marvel can do well.",3,8,19,21 June 2012
The Monuments Men," Flat script; flat acting with flashes of brilliance
","Though we appeared to dedicate more attention to captured art in 1943 than we did to the known plight of imprisoned Jews about to be slaughtered, I still wanted to see this film done well. Putting aside whether we the Allies should have taken earlier action of some form against the string of known camps, art too is a voice for all time - so I certainly understand the incentive to save it, particularly where our entire western civilization and humanity's brightest light, risked being obliterated. I respect George Clooney's goals here.But wasn't the problem George Clooney? I'll start with his podium readings to Roosevelt and Truman. Flat, so flat that a passer-by could have been just as effective. Wouldn't that segment have been better used by having the presentation just as a voice-over, with visible content consisting of Jews being rousted from their homes, their belongings inventoried and stole, throughout Europe? Why should Clooney have monopolized the scenes? He simply was dramatically empty, even with his powerful message.Because he was the director, that's why. If he wants the spotlight, he as director can shine it. And that, here, was a significant failure. No one said (or was able to say) perhaps that's not the best intro, George. A little too much of you, George.Too much George! The movie did turn in some acting tour de forces. Cate Blanchett was a revelation. Bob Balaban too. And as to Jean Dujardin, I'm glad to see he's found a niche in talkies.",Null,1,3,23 February 2014
Captain Marvel," Perhaps I'm giving it a 10 just to counter THR
","Having endured the ridiculous Aquaman (I know: different comic universe), this was a refreshing upgrade - simple and heartfelt, with the humanity of the (many) roles shown well.The script? Before I answer that, answer me whether you saw Aquaman, and its unclever blend of On Golden Pond, Casablanca, Flipper and The Adventures of Tin-Tin. Now there's a bad script.Here we have straightforward story-telling with some heart-tugs (though the kid heart-tugs could have been more sophisticated). It certainly was not a 'feminist' movie or an anti-capitalist one. Where did those folks get that impression? Perhaps some projection at work there - from misogynistic fascisti-communists maybe.The use of 90s music was on target, particularly using a pop piece during a major fight scene. Nice touch.The female lead? Not bad. She wasn't given great dialogue - too much going on in this particularly busy and complex origin story.It's a wonderful film. Only fascisti-communist misogynists will be dissappointed. (Yes I know fascism and communism are supposedly opposite. They're not.)And I'm not reading The Hollywood Reporter reviews anymore. There's your fascisti-communist misogynist.",10,7,23,11 March 2019
Aquaman," Did anybody read the script prior to filming?
","A zero-star script. One star added for competent CGI.And the worldwide public has to date paid a billion to see it.Aquaman was a series of lines and stagings from every movie you've ever seen. And not in a good way. Every scene was predictable. It doesn't take long for that realization to set in. Wait. Didn't we see that scene in Dr. Doolittle with hints of Flipper? And that scene. Was that Casablanca? And were those creatures the flying monkeys from Wizard of Oz? No? Could've fooled me.Want a poignant father-son pirate presentation of a manly heirloom (ugly and savage pirates, not Johnny Depp) right in the middle of a violent boarding? Here's your film.Want to lurch from a strange undersea world to the Sahara and then to a quaint Italian village - all in five minutes - where the lovers discover amore (and Aquaman pulls a quick Superman heroic), where you think you've somehow landed in The Adventures of Tin-Tin? Here's your film.Like your lovers to embrace and neck right in the middle of the major battle scene, complete with gal's leg halfway up the thigh of the hero? Here's your film.And if you haven't seen On Golden Pond in awhile or taken in the Fourth Station of the Cross or heard 'He has Risen' since Easter, here's your film.Bonnie and Clyde escaping under a hail of billets? Check.Shakespearean family strife (drawing from Merchant of Venice, possibly Hamlet, traces of Romeo and Juliet, a reverse MacBeth, and heavy on the Tempest)? Check.A terribly wooden script, with no susatained suspense? Check.Every outcome of every scene obvious? Check.With this amount of money in the project, there is no excuse.",1,13,25,18 January 2019
Fargo," A hideous, hyper-inflated bleakscape of a movie
","What galls me most about this movie specifically and the Coen brothers' movies generally is that they all reveal the insipidness of both the Coens and their fans. What they can't achieve with excellent dialogue, well-spun stories, and logical continuity in plotting, the Coens make up for via blood, lust, more blood, and then more blood. Vanquished from their movies is any sense of humanity or hope, and we are left in what I can best describe as a 'bleakscape' - where the great positive is the presence of so much that is negative. I do delight, however, in the spectacle of reading swooning fans' fawning tributes to the Coens' 'films' (and yes, their fans will watch only 'films').Utterly unbelievable in the bleak, depressing, and joyless tableaux they offer, the Coen films are the perfect answer to a society full of soulless narcissists.",1,50,103,28 March 2008
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Excellent entertainment but . . .
","I came to this film without seeing prior Xmen films. I was a novice. But because the story lines are relatively straightforward, the plot was easy to follow. There were just a handful of instances where knowledge of the franchise would have added context, but these were few and minor.I put this film on par with those I cannot bear to leave, even if for a brief restroom visit. Other films in this category: Avatar, The King's Speech, The Artist, the very first Lord of the Rings film. . .Here was a spellbinding tale - with top-tier performances, fascinating plot turns, and marvelously inventive uses of the source material, with new touches that were equally superb.The two minor negative points? The mutant who sent Wolverine's consciousness back in time said during the rushed planning scene that she could send someone back maybe a day or a week, but that back to 1973 was a tall order. No plot turn relied on this point.Second, the culminating events in the film relied on climaxes being reached simultaneously but in two different times. What are the odds of that occurring: 1 in a billion? These may be minor nits, so I gave it an 8.",8,0,2,24 May 2014
Saving Private Ryan," Brilliant movie even if too violent
","I've just seen Saving Private Ryan for the first time and, as occurs when I first see a film, I quickly check IMDb to see what the Haters and Lovers of the movie say in their reviews. First, the Haters.Any time any movie portrays America as savior of Europe in World War II, the result gets panned by these groups (and if they're not yet organized, they should be as they deserve each other): (1) America haters from any country, notably (a) Germany ('we weren't ALL bad') or (b) the UK ('we carried the burden until the tardy self-interested Yanks decided to enter war, which by the way was almost won when the US came in'), and (2) hard leftists everywhere (how the left is anywhere entitled to credibility is utterly beyond me). Hey Germany! You WERE bad! Hitler was constitutionally elected and brought to power by the German electorate, only too happy to see the Jew (and the occasional Bolshevik) blamed for everything afflicting Weimar Germany. Hey UK! We love you, but sometimes your hard right and hard left are hard to stomach. Pssst! You, our British cousins, had LOST the war by 1941. It was over, ended, caput, stick-a-fork-in-em done. Winston well knew how critical it was that America enter the war - which it did, and which it won. We are delighted that winning the war was largely an effort of the English-speaking world, but it was the English-speaking world's largest country that led the way, turned the tide and won the war. Stop with the idiosyncratic reasons why, exactly, the US simply joined an already successful enterprise. She didn't. Britain was sunk and defeated, with precious little industrial capacity left - industrial might had to come from the US and Canada, but mostly the US. Saving Private Ryan isn't 'propaganda' - it contains critical truths, and sometimes truth makes for excellent propaganda.",7,2,3,4 January 2009
Django Unchained," Thank you, Quentin, for more violence, more gore, more blood
","This movie is unwatchable for those who value human life and take a stand in opposition to extreme violence as art. I found myself having to endure it as a compromise group movie choice. I walked out.Spattering blood everywhere is not art. Art is not coming up with new and shocking ways to kill. Art is not found in seeing a semi-detached human head continue to bleed, the result of multiple gun shots.Whether practiced by street crooks or fawned-over Tarantino, serial killing is ghastly. When defended as art, it becomes ghastlier yet.I know there is a market for this type of horrific violence, and that's tragic.When your creative juices run dry, shoot a gun. That's Tarantino. That's this movie.",1,54,101,30 December 2012
Aladdin," An astonishing failure
","It is now a trend. The big budget segment of the film industry is so full of CGI and (in this case) making sure that just the right kind of diversity (and nothing else) dominated, they forget how to write literate, funny scripts.This was a strictly connect-the-dots production. Both leading roles were oddly hollow. The genie not believable. Jafar as threatening as an aggressive usher. I read the press materials about the triumph of making it a point to cast people who look like they're from the region. But then what? Put San Fernando Valley English into their mouths?And what English? Every scene was predictable. Sometimes even the next line was predictable. For all that production money, they should have hired a literate someone to fix the script.A grievous waste.",1,128,242,26 May 2019
Frozen," I would rather watch . . . anything other than this
","I can barely believe that this insipid junk made money. It was 'off' in every regard. The two sisters, on whom all of the tension of the plot rests, were wooden, uninspired, and just plain boring. Of course, if you don't care about those two, you're only going to be antagonized by the rest of the film too. Every character, scene, and resolution is only going to be annoying and seemingly contrived. And then the plot twist at the end. No handsome prince for this one! She loves her sister! Are you kidding? This bizarre, modern take in a film with a talking snowman and cynical moose.Non-discerning kinds under age four may like this. But anyone over five with eyes and a brain will wonder when the real fun will start, and will keep wondering all the way to the end of the film.Ugh!",1,6,15,9 January 2015
The Lion King," A vapid remake
","When the highpoint in a Disney film is a musical reference to another popular Disney film, we are in for an unoriginal evening.This remake excruciatingly follows the animated version, except for one thing: in the remake, Simba the cub looks like a plush toy.I don't have to comment on the plot and it would be impossible to write a spoiler because every detail of the original is repeated here.Every.Last.One.And the CGI. Sitting still, the animals were animals. Moving, though, was dangerous for the poor things. Sometimes jerky, sometimes not. Lion laying down? Either have the Lion hit the ground smoothly and naturally or keep the creature standing up. Chase scene needs multiple openings just small enough to slow down the predator, except for its big ugly face? (Maybe in 3D that becomes more exhilarating)I've also seen more than a few films where the actors look onscreen like they're waiting for stage direction and somehow the awkwardness makes its way into the final cut. But CGI animals? How could they possibly have been drawn that way?The kids in my life loved it, ages 4 to 15. So that's something.",1,57,88,19 July 2019
1917," Literate, gripping ... and manipulative
","Well acted and literate, and elevates history, all of which are good, but I found it crassly manipulative, with too many scripted coincidences that amounted to unwitting parody of the genre 'single mission war movie.' For me, it became unwatchable. I walked out.",1,19,45,24 January 2020
Les Misérables," A Magnificent Triumph - Surpasses the Stage Version
","Is there anything more predictable than the high-brows lamenting that this piece of fluff should command attention?First, the abomination of the original stage play itself, which - of course! - ruined Broadway for the thinking people. ('More Hedda Gabler!')Second, who do these actors think they are, singing! Third, why on earth do directors think that panoramic film spectacles should be panoramic and spectacular! Who do they think they are, trying to fiddle with people to make them emote?Fourth, too many . . . (fill in blank) close-ups, singing scenes, missed high notes, close-ups (again). In the manner of a famously dim royal in another film who critiqued by offering that Mozart's piece had 'too many notes,' the humorless in this case might say 'so much grandness!' and mean it as a slight.This was a magnificent piece of film-making. Far more intimate than on stage - and containing an actual sense of story. In fact, while being superior to the stage play in terms of the immediacy of the experience, it couldn't have been more different in the way familiar scenes were captured and mounted with scene-setting that was not constrained by the limitations of the stage.I applaud the film-maker. I applaud the director. I applaud the actors, particularly Mr. Jackman, Miss Hathaway, and Mr. Redmayne. Filming them as they sang was a brilliant stroke. It intensified both the singing and the acting, particularly in the most emotionally intense moments.Brilliant. And, as to the high-brows, they probably still harrumph about the Wizard of Oz, remain so very dejected that Mary Poppins didn't have the dark tone of P. L. Travers books, and scoff because The Sound of Music contained fictional elements (quelle horreur!). We can never please that type, but we can certainly enjoy majestic film-making - and Hooper has directed a majestic film. Encore!",10,4,7,27 December 2012
The Godfather: Part III," One of only two movies I've walked out on
","It's neen 27 years and I haven't forgotten. This was a stinker, and one of only two films I've walked out on - the other being The Big Easy. I guess there's a third I SHOULD have walked out on: Star Wars I, whatever it was called.This movie has the name 'Godfather' in it, but that was the last similarity between this and the masterpieces I and II. No gripping story - barely a story at all. And Miss Coppola, wow. It was like Anjelica Huston's first efforts: hollow, wooden, monotonous.A stinker.So bad it's good? No, worse than that.",1,2,8,25 September 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Screenplay drafted from severely revised Cliff's Notes
","Here is a summary of this film: Attack and destruction by fierce dragon visiting from Enchanted.I want gold! Battle.Little bit of dialogue. (None convincing.) Battle. (Hard to tell who was fighting and why.) Dialogue etc. Enter cross-dresser.Battle etc.Poorly developed characters were presented without context. Once they spoke their paltry and wooden dialogue, we quickly learned there would never be a context, at least not in this film.The battle scenes were incomprehensible. Beings and things appeared out of nowhere then disappeared. Absurd antics during battle done with obvious CGI (that must have been on sale). The elf latching onto a giant flying bird had the visual credibility of 1939's Dorothy doll (with robotic moving legs) being carried away by the flying monkey.An awful film. No heart. No soul. An affront to Tolkien.",1,10,20,2 January 2015
Saving Mr. Banks," A triumph
","This was a nearly perfect film - in the same way that The King's Speech and The Artist were nearly perfect films: drawn with an eye for cues large and small, in touch with its audience, and a pitch-perfect treatment of the material. There is no missed opportunity here, no overacting, no underacting - we were led into the world of this film, there to come to know and care about its players.This is a documentary played for drama and comedy. We get pulled in to the early small and large concepts that eventually made the film Mary Poppins great - the wry look, the sly look, the pencil captures, the effect of music, all perfectly blended.While I did deduct a star for Ms. Travers' loving and conciliatory embrace of a Mickey Mouse plush toy, I did that more to be a realist: I mean, nothing's really 'perfect', is it? As to objections you may have read about, disregard: --'not all details were precisely true' - In reducing weeks and years of many human lives to two hours, creative license has to be deployed to make sure the narrative holds together. The near-perfection of this narrative demonstrates that creative license was well used.--'Tom Hanks didn't get Disney's accent right' - Walt Disney had an accent? I think of the many legacies Walt left us, memory of an accent is not one of them. Next.--'Some of the plush toys depicted were not actually Disney's under license yet.' We did not go to see this movie to keep track of plush toy licensing rights.--'P.L. Travers had a vision of Mary Poppins and Disney wrecked it.' Had Disney not 'wrecked it,' P. L. Travers, Mary Poppins, Mrs. Travers' deep love for her flawed father would all now have been forgotten, entirely off our radar. Disney made immortal what Mrs. Travers most loved, something that would never have happened had Mrs. Travers not signed over the rights.--'The title should have mentioned Mary Poppins and Walt Disney, otherwise people don't know what it's about and box office will suffer.' Yes, and can you imagine the reaction of those people showing up and complaining that they thought this was going to be 'just like Mary Poppins'? Nine stars. Brilliant. Simply brilliant film-making.",9,1,4,28 December 2013
Pitch Perfect," I guess this is what you get when literacy is unavailable
","I was a prisoner of this plodding, unfunny, downmarket predictable anti-confection during a car ride. I was driving 14-year olds 500 miles and we needed movies for our onboard video system. I managed to get incensed. This PG-13 'tween' film was so outlandishly sexual that I saw fit to accompany the whole movie with my very own morals narrative. A very special type of dubbing. And because our onboard TV puts the sound controls in front of me (thank you Lord), I got to reduce the volume for my 'Morality Dubs' every time the dialogue edged into the abyss. There were plenty of abysses. And I narrated all of them. With a sense of humor designed to illuminate young boys who we want to become gentlemen, not pigs (yes, I said that).A movie for piglets to wallow in.",1,4,5,14 August 2018
