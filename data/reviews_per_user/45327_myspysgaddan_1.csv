Child 44," Dramatically intriguing thriller all the way through
","This movie is very underrated since both acting and the movie itself is very well made. From my point of view it was so dramatically intriguing I almost bit off every single nail before it ended 2 h and 17 minutes later. The great actors did not save any powder and made the long time spent well worth it. Also I have not read the book and that might be for the best of my health without the sleepless nights. I might just be satisfied with what this movie gave me. An excellent show in it's category that made my mind go bananas and barely let me get a hold of myself before hitting me with an invisible hand, having my deep diving focus a little bit dazed. It's what happens when you get too mesmerized by all the violence and mystery going on. Just remember to breath now and then and you might just as well be alive and satisfied when you put your nails at risk with this movie!Also if it makes any kind of statement at all for any of you all out there reading this... I never ever even bothered to write a review on a movie. Now I just had to because this one was worth it. As it appeared to show it took 10 out of 10 nails so I will rate this movie: 10 out of 10 Nails!",10,4,8,3 August 2015
