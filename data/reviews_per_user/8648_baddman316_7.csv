Scarface," my scarface review
","being a long time Al Pacino fan, i would have to say that Scarface is his best work ever! A powerful drug lord named Tony Montana doesn't mess around when coming to America. He works hard trying to be the best he can making a name for himself. Not only does he play his cards right, but he doesn't give a crap about nobody and trusts only himself. This movie is well written and is listed as one of my favorite movies of all time! Of course, this movie also plays off as a popular video game called Grand Theft Auto Miami. Very similar to each other as you are the rookie dealer trying to make it big and make a name for himself. So that's pretty amazing.",Null,0,1,28 September 2009
Casablanca," Casablanca review
","Casablanca is said to be the most popular film. It is maybe the most quoted film as well. One of the film's well-known lines, 'Here's lookin' at you, kid,' was not in the original draft but was actually added in as the result of Bogart and Bergman's poker playing between takes. So with that said, that line became famous and maybe probably quoted to this very day! The movie is one that I would recommend to others. Its scope is simply amazing and it plays an incredible melodrama. Casablanca is all about sacrifices and about the good that human beings can do. Some say it is a sappy love story but it really isn't, even though some of the notions in the film are relatively romantic.",Null,1,2,1 November 2009
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane review
","The movie gives the feeling of being thoroughly designed and structured. In a number of situations such meticulous fore thought suffocates a film, having no space for the cast to breathe. But Orsen Welles (director), with his great skill and actor ability, smoothly side-steps this trap. By creating characters which are inconsistent, but yet interesting, Welles gives the gifted cast roles to elaborate on and run with. The dialog, sometimes first-person and sometimes voice-over, is humorous, convincing, clever and well-structured. Plus the plot of the movie never gets lost at any point. In addition, the script is exactly to the point saying what needs to be said. A further neat point is that sentences tend to overlap as people argue and struggle to get their point across, just like in real life. Orson Welles' Citizen Kane is a movie of recommendation and will never disappoint.",Null,1,2,1 November 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," dr. strangelove review
","There's not a false note in Dr. Strangelove. This 1964 black and white comedy about the ultimate madness of nuclear conflict and the bloody folly of war is a stunning success, and one of the best Cold War movies ever to be made. From the evocative credit sequence of a B-52 bomber and a KC-135 tanker pairing for a romantic mid-air refueling to the totally ridiculous names for all the characters, Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is the funniest black and white film that I have watched yet. It is widely regarded as the screen's greatest satire, a film that terrifically encapsulates the fear and paranoia of the Cold War. There is not a sequence in the motion picture in which the dialogue is not quotable -- certainly, there are so many well-remembered moments that viewers and critics will disagree on the best, though surely the sight of Major Kong waving his cowboy hat as he rides the bomb into oblivion is among the most enduring images of its era.",Null,0,1,14 December 2009
The Grapes of Wrath," Grapes of Wrath review
","The grapes of wrath is so realistic and breath taking, it will leave you in a world of emotions. it is the story of the Joad family, who are kicked off their land in Oklahoma because of drought and poverty. Since there wasn't a lot of variation on the black and white cinematography in 1940's, the lack of color increases the emotions of wholeness,poverty and emptiness due to the family's foreclosure and forcing them to move. The Grapes of Wrath is merely not a cutting edge sit at the end of your seat film, but it is a realistic portrayal of the suffering that so many people and families experienced during the Great Depression. The performance by the actors and the work of the production company couldn't be more on its mark. the experience is not only powerful and moving but also educational.",Null,1,2,13 October 2009
The Graduate," The graduate review
","The graduate was definitaly a favorite movie of mine. its funny but yet romantic style keeps the audience in line as to what is going to happen next. This is probably one of Dustin Hoffmans greatest early work and rise to success. it is one of the key, ground-breaking films of the late 1960s, and helped to set in motion a new era of film-making. The film is a biting satire comedy about a recent nebbish, East Coast college graduate who finds himself alienated and adrift in the shifting, social and sexual mores of the 1960s, and questioning the values of society (with its keyword 'plastics'). This comedy is wonderfully crafted by director Nichols who presents a half-dozen hilarious scenes, including Hoffman escaping badgering advice by submerging himself in the family pool in scuba gear and Bancroft's sudden shift from respectable matron to predatory tease, hiking her skirts lasciviously and purring promises of smoldering sex which almost put Hoffman into a comatose state. Nichols was to declare: 'I think Benjamin and Elaine will end up exactly like their parents; that's what I was trying to say in the last scene.' Yet the well-to-do younger audiences of the day interpreted this sequence of blatant heroics as a wonderful act of defiance by two young people whose destinies were being manipulated by their parents.",Null,0,0,14 December 2009
Psycho," psycho review
","Psycho is the greatest horror film ever made, hands down. This is probably one of Alfred Hitchcocks more famous and better work in his career. Even though he is an odd person, he has the mind of an odd mysterious suspenseful genius. Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. His brilliance is in making a climax that is at once both scary and hilarious. For too long the famous shower scene with the girl getting murdered is still a favorite scene to remember from people when they talk about Psycho. Also, The Bates Motel is a famous landmark name in the movie. The storyline is well done, the acting is almost to perfection, and the cinematography is acceptable in every way.",Null,0,0,2 December 2009
