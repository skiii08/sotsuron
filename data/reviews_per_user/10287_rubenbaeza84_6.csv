Blade Runner 2049," Despite the news slamming it's box office revenue, this is a good film.
","The new Blade runner is not going to be for everybody, make no mistake about that, it's not your conventional blockbuster movie and that is why you should consider watching it. For years the movie industry has focused it's attention on mostly genre films like the superhero films that are dominating the big and small screens. For a gem like Blade Runner 2049, we get a film that wishes to challenge the conventions of today's Hollywood films. The film is indeed long and focuses less on big action sequences and more on character and plot. You are not going to get your finale climactic battle scene and the evil scientists corporate headquarters or a spectacular gunfight, it's not that kind of film. The film is about a man named K who must find out the origins of a body found in near a farm were he 'retired' his last replicant. The film is definitely a detective story and plays like a traditional detective story that just happens to have a sci fi setting. You have your antagonist in Jared Leto who is unfortunately the weakest part of the movie. He is not giving a bad performance, but his performance is pretty much dry and doesn't set him apart from the traditional mustache twirling villain from any film that contains a clichéd mustache twirling villain. The rest of the actors are phenomenal from Ryan to Harrison Ford and every actor on this list.Now for the more technical stuff. The film is shot very beautifully and it enriches the dystopic and decaying cityscape of Los Angeles that we came to love from the first movie. It has CGI that blends well with the environment which is good because sometimes CGI can call too much attention to itself and detract too much away from the movie itself, fortunately this is not the case as the CGI supports the film and it's story. It would be difficult to compare this film with the first one as the first film has set standards that not many films can live up to and luckily this one does and I'm very nit picky when it comes to comparing to the original. I highly recommend the film to those who wish to watch something that isn't another 'Avengers' film or has the traditional feel of a classic Noir film with a big budget to support it. It's very rare to see these type of movies at the theaters now in days so please don't pass up this opportunity because of 'box office' numbers.",10,10,24,9 October 2017
Léon: The Professional," One of my all time favorite Assassin films
","I enjoy horror, I enjoy action, Gangster films, Westerns and I enjoy art-house. One genre I cannot get enough of is Assassin films. A loose genre that derives mostly from action films, on the top of the helm is Leon. Maybe not the greatest action film but a very memorable one that rises in the ranks of action films that stands along with other notable assassin films like John Woo's The Killer, Fallen Angels, Crying Freeman, Nikita, Fulltime killer, collateral, Le Samouraï, Another Lonely hit-man, and Rainy Dog. The Bullets fly and people die in this brutal blood for blood and yet very bizarre love story about a lonely hit-man and a young girl with complex emotions and complicated feelings towards her supposed new guardian. Leon is smooth, tough and very articulate in the art of stealth combat, he uses his skills to kill people and get paid well for it as well. Matidla, young naive and hopeless in a world were everyone seems to turn their backs on her. Living with abusive and neglectful parents, things don't seem to be getting any brighter for Mathilda. Until her family is massacred by a bunch of crooked DEA officers, she is left with only one option, safety in the hands of her mysterious neighbor. Leon wants her to forget, but she only wants revenge for her little brother that got caught in the ambush. Leon reluctantly teaches her the trade of the assassins and even lets her use a sniper rifle on civilians (by only shooting them with paint.) He even brings her on his shifts. Matilda develops feelings for the private Hit-man. Leon wants to part with her but at the same time needs her company in a life were the only people he talks to are the people he'll soon kill. After Matilda makes a failed attempt at getting her killers, its Leon to the rescue. In this beautifully choreographed and well set-up action piece, we see Leon at his prime and most powerful. Even 'Kill Bills' 'the Bride' would be afraid to go one on one with the deadly Leon. It ends with a climatic shoot-out and a literally explosive finale with Leon sacrificing himself for his dear Matilda. This scene is what makes it a powerful action film. Leon is set against the entire police force and the SWAT team. The only thing that will save him are his killing skills. Great music score and powerful and emotional scenes that makes Leon a standout action thriller, I haven't seen a movie that could leave you in goosebumps since John Woo's 'The Killer' probably the only other action film that can match Leons pure intensity.",10,5,8,7 March 2008
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Fans need to chill out.
","I can't believe the user reviews on here. I honestly believe that there isn't anything you can do to win over the hardcore fans. They complain and complain and complain.... They either need to grow up or get a girlfriend because they whine like children. I enjoyed the film for what it could deliver, which was a space opera spectacle. I understood the problems when the prequels came out, now I wonder what it is they are complaining about now? The story was about Luke coming to terms with his own legacy and his part in the saga. It's one of Hamills best performances as an actor and I really enjoyed it. As far as stories are concerned, I liked that it went against expectations, the best movies are always the risk takers. I liked that you thought Benicio del Toro wasn't what you thought he was. I liked that Luke pulled the rug under Kyo ren during their final confrontation, I also enjoyed the part when Luke made peace with his past and vanished. I can't tell people to like the film but I think they can get so overdramatic about things. If it's a good film, then leave it a good film, if it's a bad film, there is no need to throw a tantrum. Star wars fans can be so nitpicky, and this is coming from an original star wars fan. You guys need to lighten up because there is no end in sight for this series and more is to come.",9,0,0,18 December 2017
Deadpool," I still think it's overrated
","It will probably be the most unpopular opinion from me but it's the most honest. My introduction to deadpool happened in the early 90's when I was looking through the X-Men action figures at a Wal-Mart and saw the character for the first time. It looked cool but I dismissed him as another generic character that looked less like an X-Men and more a GI Joe villain that would probably lose to snake eyes. That was then and now he has his own film and I still don't understand the appeal. I like the style and the gore factor, I even chuckled at some of the jokes of the film. When it comes down to the movie itself, I just couldn't get into the character of Wade Wilson. I thought he was annoying and loud throughout the whole thing, I didn't see anything unique about the fourth wall break as it's been done to death and better in films such as Fight Club and Ferris Buellers day off. The insane world created for the film is more appropriate for a Japanese anime on a sugary high. The villains are just there for deadpool to have an excuse to kill and the people he interacted with have more to say than our titular hero. I felt like I was watching a superhero film directed by a guy that wanted to impress Quentin Tarantino after watching Kill Bill for the first time but didn't realize he was better off watching Shogun Assassin instead. I don't necessarily think it's a bad movie, I think it's a funny romp on the superhero genre but should've focused more on the satire than making penis jokes and references no one understands.Deadpool is unique but is not as smart as it wants the audience to think it is. This is Ryan Reynolds saving grace after so many failures and stinkers at the box office, one comes to think will this film series be the only thing that will keep him from making straight to video or put him in obscurity? I'll admit I enjoyed the elements of it but that's just it, there are only elements to enjoy as the rest of the movie is a loud MTV film with too many bells and whistles and not enough meat. If you want a good laugh, stick to the naked gun series. If you want carnage and blood, stick to the best of 80's action.I give it a 7 out of 10. It works when it has to despite it's annoying character.",7,3,8,22 May 2017
300," This movie was a piece of s***
","I apologize but I don't know why people would wanna watch a film about half-naked in-the-closet homosexuals fighting a bunch of bad Arab stereotypes. This movie even carries pro American symbolism which cheapens the movie even further. Does anyone even know that the Spartans actually did practice intimacy with young boys? I didn't care for the poor dialog and the unnecessary British accents. About half of the movie has Slow motion action scenes. If those action sequences moved at a normal pace then the movie would probably be only an hour long. I got nauseated by the entire brown background that made the movie look really out of place, not to mention the out of place Androgynous villain Xerxes. I don't know why this movie made money but I sure do want my 9 dollars back cuz I could've used it to buy a pack of smokes, instead I watched a movie that makes me yawn compared to other battle films like the Brilliantly made 'Braveheart.' Overall this movie was a waste of time and a waste of brain cells as well. Even if I downloaded the movie, I still feel like I wasted two hours when I could've done something more productive. I know people liked this film but I ain't one of those people.",1,5,9,7 March 2008
Alien: Covenant," Not as bad as people say it is.
","Don't get me wrong, it's not gonna live up to Alien, Aliens or the other sequels but I honestly believe it is not as bad as people wish to put it. I'm probably more forgiving towards this series than most fans are. To tell you the truth, the fans have never been forgiving towards this series since part 3, which in my opinion is an underrated classic. The real problem with the movie is that it's too predictable and there needed to be more xenomorph. Other than that it's still a good old fashioned slasher film with big effects. I think people over blow the film because they want something that can never be achieved and that's a perfect movie and sorry to break the news but no movie is perfect and there will never be a perfect movie. If you want to know if you will enjoy this movie, don't bother talking to the fans because they still think it's 1986 and I survived Alien vs Predator.",7,5,13,21 May 2017
