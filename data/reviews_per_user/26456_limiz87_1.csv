The Hangover," Great idea, bad execution
","Firstly, I must admit I saw this movie with high expectations - everybody kept saying how funny this movie is. So I was prepared to laugh for 90 minutes. But now I'm very disappointed.I liked the idea. 4 men go to Las Vegas for a crazy night and end up losing the groom. They can't remember anything and have to put the puzzle back together and find the groom before the wedding. Sounds funny already, right? But it wasn't funny. Okay, there were a few laughs and overall it was an entertaining movie, but absolutely nothing special.The movie had so many story lines that could have made it very funny. First, there was this baby and they had no idea whose was it. But the baby was there for 15 min and nothing funny happened. The tiger - also nothing exciting (what was the point of Mike Tyson??) Phil being in the hospital - they said that the pictures would explain it, but I'm sorry, I didn't get it. Stu lost his tooth and the reason was mentioned once. I didn't like the place where they finally found Doug - who was red now because he had spent 2 nights on the roof - he could have easily saved himself from there just by screaming. They never gave us a timeline of the events - how and when everything exactly happened. It would have been nice to see everything - maybe as flashbacks or fast forward in the end of the movie. PS How did the chicken get there? The characters were too stereotypical - Alan as this crazy guy who never had had friends before; Phil as the guy who only wanted to party; Stu as this man who was terrorized by his girlfriend and finally starts dating a stripper and Doug.. I'm sorry, but Doug was so boring and unmemorable that there's nothing to say about him.This movie tried to be everything and it failed.",4,3,7,18 August 2009
