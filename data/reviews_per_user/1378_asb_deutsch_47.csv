It," Nice ingredients of comedy and horror
","This movie doesn't need 3D at all. You will always be immersed in the film! It never loses steam and Hats off to the cast. Pennywise was phenomenal. The film works so well because character development was handled carefully, we learn about each of our young protagonists along the way, and what we learn about them is continual all the way",8,2,5,14 September 2017
A Star Is Born," I am happy that it didn't win a single Golden Globe despite five nominations!
","This is Lady Gaga's first prominent role in a feature film. And no surprises that she sings and strips in this movie!
There was more emphasis on Bradley Copper with his personal issues (just like Joaquin Phoenix for portraying musician Johnny Cash in the biopic Walk the Line). And that is how Lady Gaga is a born star!If you have seen Walk the Line, La La Land and/or Ashiqui 2, then you can predict this movie from scratch. Otherwise, if you are a hard-core musical drama fan, then this drama is for you. Would have been better if released ten years ago!As Warner Media Bros. supplement CNN, it was no wonder why the rave reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. 90% RT rating? Sheesh!
Exaggerated and boring...better watch Bohemian Rhapsody.",5,2,6,17 January 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Again overrated!
","Pros: The visuals and the ending was well constructed; IMAX with Laser resulted in crystal clear images, projected by dual projectors on a giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, along with powerful 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand!Cons: Its dejà vu again. Since most of us has seen SW:VII(TFA) and the old trilogy; all of us know what is going to happen, especially in the first half! I don't want to spill the beans!Verdict: I would prefer SW:TFA in lieu of this movie. With the concentration on action over narrative, we're left with a Disney outing that can't help but feel like it's lacking where it really counts. In short, old wine in a new bottle!",4,14,29,15 December 2016
Aquaman," Aquaman or Rajnikant 2.0? Atleast this CGI roller-coaster will please every Marvel fan!
","I have mixed response after watching this flick. First the visuals.
I watched Aquaman in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with no chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing. In a nutshell, a Picasso masterpiece of visuals.Where is the character development? And where's the mission? The first half was nice, especially the script falls flat. It was more like Slaughter-man to me. I mean, what was Aquaman's weakness, to begin with? Black Manta's father shot him with a launcher and it seemed that it bothered Aquaman like a mosquito bite! Seriously, if Manta was not part of the movie it would have been worse.For Superman, it is Kryptonite. Then why Aquaman was punched and KO in Justice League? At least there was a twist in the middle of JL.Or pure female fantasy? I mean it was nice that Meera's character was not portrayed as a damsel in distress. She was looking sexy in the tight suit but why forced feminism? Why did Atlanna cry when both brothers were fighting? Rather she just saw her son going to 'bars' without a tear in her eye. Arthur and Meera going to Africa and Italy seemed like they were planning on a honeymoon!Verdict: Avatar+Tron+Star Wars+2.0*
My score is 4.5/10 but I will add 0.5 since the visuals were far much better than BvS and JL. And I watched The Dark Knight as it commemorated a decade recently. No DC/Marvel movie has even came close to that masterpiece. Sigh!*Rajnikanth can do everything and anything, and Aquaman is no different!",5,1,7,23 December 2018
Deadpool 2," I wish they would have released it during the exam time.
","Deadpool 2 is all that we expected. It shown thelight side and the dark side of Wade Wilson
Too much anti-DC dialogues was killing the script. A little predictable but it the storyboard ended nicely.",7,0,1,5 July 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," A big 'hulk-smash' to Thor 2
","A much better follow-up from the disappointing Thor: The Dark World (how it got an IMDb average score of 7/10 is still puzzling!). Here, we see the emotional and psychological impact of our hero in a meaningful way!I watched Thor 3 in IMAX 3D with Laser and it was mind-blowing. This resulted in images projected by Dual Projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX (no cuts in the screen at all!), along with 12000 watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand each time you see Thor and Hulk fight! The 3D was unnecessary, though.I felt it was a refreshing take on the superhero genre and here it still applies. We always get that story where we find out the reason behind why a hero takes the path again. We've seen it many times with the likes of Batman, Spider-man, etc. but here we see this again in a different manner. This is the main point in this movie and really make you root for the superhero!What's also great here is the director of Green Lantern and story writers are not dwindling on too much on what happened in Thor: The Dark World and the story is progressing using the theme to Thor & Avenger's over the trilogy's second installment.Verdict: The important lesson is to get back up again, no matter how much you lost! My digital score: 7.5/10 More luck for Marvel's next outing!",7,0,4,4 November 2017
Ready Player One," Spielberg finally leaves his period dramas!
","Predictable but fun to watch as augmented reality is the hot topic nowadays!
I was surprised to see Simon Pegg. There are so many Easter eggs and even the WB references were also nice.
I went in with low expectations as I wasn't convinced by the trailer and I liked the action live animated fused feature. Let's see how 2045 turns out like this or not!",6,0,1,20 December 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Hail the critics and Robert Downey Jr. also
","A moment to rejoice! After a long time the critics are totally in sync with me. Yesterday, I was watching Enemy and 10 days ago I was watching Transformers 5, and both of them sucked badly! But today, I found something refreshing. This is the best Spider-man movie ever made!I watched Homecoming in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!It may have taken 15 years, 6 movies, 3 different lead actors, 2 reboots but Spidey finally has shown redemption. Sony's Spider reboot in 2014 was a disaster. From the villain to 3D, every element sucked. This new reboot places the media- hyped and over-rated 'The Amazing Spider-Man' franchise into the hall of shame.Spiderman is just a teenage boy..but Tony Stark can convince any one. Even us. In the trailer, he mentions 'If you are nothing with the suit, you don't deserve it!' The question is: Can Spider-man carry it's own weight in the near future without Iron-man? I mean that he was also utilized in Captain America: Civil War.Hats off to Michael Keaton from his transition to Batman to Vulture. The best villain after Doc Oct (2004). He also highlights today's situation that since the world has change, so should we. I don't want to spoil the fun, so enjoy watching the movie.My significant digit score: 8.7/10",9,25,44,6 July 2017
Horrible Bosses," A good one time watch
","Kudos to the 'killer cast'- Aniston and Spacey sizzle as crude bosses. The cast is quite good, Kevin Spacey shines in the role of one the bosses and as does Jennifer Aniston. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell also worth a mention are the most funniest of them all. The lead- trio share a nice chemistry and even if unoriginal they fill in the shoes just fine. Colin Farell of course, devilish indeed! ðŸ˜ˆ HB is still funny though, and with a neat running time it's a story you can get invested in without having to pay too much attention. Many of the jokes are funny and a scene involving an assassin who turns out not to be an assassin is very funny. Though it should be funnier than it is ðŸ˜‚",7,10,11,11 November 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," More of Visuals, less of script
","Review: This theme was seen in M:I-4 and Skyfall, where the hero has to hide and use his brains. Now with Captain America, I thought the first movie was okay, one of the better Marvel movies, not great but OK, so I went along with my friend hoping for something better. It gets off to a kinetic start only to lose steam before blowing everything up. 3D technology appears to be very lacking for fast close action fighting sequences.The biggest fault found in The Winter Soldier is that it does not address the whereabouts of other heroes or where we are in terms of the time line of the other movies. Scarlet isn't looking beautiful; the Hawk guy - where did he come from? Why can't Captain America call on Tony Stark to help him out or even Hawk-eye who is a member of Shiel himself? You cannot exclude these characters once you have opened Pandora's Box!",5,11,20,5 April 2014
Doctor Strange," Disney is evil. Again overrated!
","It's almost like Batman Begins meshed with the visuals of Inception.Reminded me of Batman Begins where he learns his training. Clever from Marvel to use Tilda Swinton instead of a male trainer. Doctor Strange may have dazzling visuals and a great lead performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as the Sorcerer Supreme, but with the concentration on action over narrative, we're left with a Marvel outing that can't help but feel like it's lacking where it really counts.We all know that with Rotten Tomatoes lately up is down. The more money that studios pay critics to say kind things about their horrid slop the worse the movie is. Critics supporting Disney/Marvel as usual. 90% RT rating? Sheesh!",6,4,8,5 November 2016
Southpaw," Southpaw still mesmerizing
","I have watched action thriller Olympus Has Fallen (2013) and sports drama Southpaw (2015) this week. 🤗There are so many good things that can be said about this film. The performances by the main characters is exceptional. The story as well is very good. Where it is let down is, on stylistic choices which is hugely disappointing. The film is a boxing film that goes from one guy, losing everything to regain it for his daughter. It's like a sub-conscious drive in Fuqua to raise this film after he directed Olympia Has Fallen If he simply focused on strong editing, better pace during the dramas and maybe, just put McAdams in hospital because the lack of an ambulance and recovery in a modern day city as she is surrounded by people is the plothole of this movie.Southpaw, also predictable, but I loved the cheesy dialogues when Billy's (Gyllenhaal) daughter says to him 'You f*** up'! 😁",7,0,0,1 September 2016
Watchmen," Celebrating a decade of heroes: an answer for die-hard Marvel fans...
","What should an team-up flick should look like? Zack Snyder brings layers of darkness and peels those layers successfully (I wish he could do the same for BvS, unfortunately!)
The plot is complex and I am happy that there is an upcoming TV series. Some characters resemble the Tier 1 superheroes but it is not a shame as the focus is on the 80's.
The only demerit is that the movie is long, more than 3 hours. Some may feel the ending as an unjustified answer, but sometimes we have to accept the ugly truth!My score: 7.5/10",7,3,4,13 March 2019
Justice League," No more Martha 'mama' fight and a dream for comic-buffs!
","First things first- Ignore the critics. They are totally biased against DCEU. Guys, most of you watched Thor: Ragnarok. Do you really think a movie gets a 94% rating based on comedy and better visuals? This is absolutely crazy. We all know that with Rotten Tomatoes. The more money that studios pay critics to say kind things about their horrid slop the worse the movie is. Critics supporting Disney/Marvel as usual. 90+% RT rating? Sheesh!Let's talk about the movie. I watched JL in IMAX 3D with Laser and it was mind-blowing. This resulted in images not that sharp but projected by Dual Projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX (no cuts in the screen at all!), along with 12000 watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand each time you see action! Let us discuss what I liked and disliked:+ The Bat-crawler + WW entry in the movie+ Bat-suit upgrade + Victor Stone: The best side actor + An improvement from Henry Cavill. + Actors gelling as one cohesive unit. + Hats off to Synder for not giving up on the project despite family issues.+ I liked that this movie connected to Batman V. Superman. + JL is much better than Batman V. Superman. + The end credit scene is the best I have ever seen.<ul><li>Ben Affleck looked lethargic in the second half. </li></ul><ul><li>Ezra Miller: Silly and not funny. I still prefer Grant Gustin! </li></ul><ul><li>Too much lightening used for the Flash. </li></ul><ul><li>Running time of movie was slightly short. </li></ul><ul><li>Overspent the budget ($300 million?!?) </li></ul><ul><li>Super-villain could have been more of a threat.</li></ul>Finally, we have achieved a live-action version of the animated JL series!",9,1,3,18 November 2017
Split," It is a surprise hit...no denying about that.
","It is a hit. No denying about that. I guess I came in with more higher expectations. It was a good movie but I wouldn't say great. I'd guess that Shyamalan is back!BTW, This doesn't make sense... Kevin directs Casey to where his shotgun is and orders her to kill him before his other personalities begin to take over, switching from one to the other until 'the Beast' returns. Another question was why did not the psychologist order the hospitalization of Kevin? Shouldn't such people be in mental hospitals taken care of? Other questions could be raised as to how could he live in a zoo without anyone noticing him commuting? Is this really a sequel to Unbreakable?",7,1,9,9 February 2017
We're the Millers," Enjoy without seeing trailer...
","It's been 1 year exactly after it's release. Also I like Emma Roberts(she's stunning in every snapshot!). Much better than other comedies! Punchlines were perfect! We're The Millers is a crude and sometimes inappropriate comedy movie. In my estimation, it does a great job with the laughs, even if the story does get a bit sappy at the end (as most movies do anyway). I recommend you watch this movie whenever you feel like laughing your ass off, provided you're not offended by the content. It will most definitely please you. Still my favorite of the bunch is Sudeikis, as he always plays these parts right on the money.",8,1,2,30 August 2014
Dunkirk," If you watched the trailer, there is nothing much more to offer except the IMAX coverage
","I got disappointed while watching Dunkirk as it is more or less like a tick-tock version of Saving Private Ryan. The background score is so much emphasized that you can barely hear the dialogues between the characters. I recall that there was a similar problem in Inception where the old Japanese's dialogue was in a mutely tone. The surprising thing also is that there is any hardly any character development in the script, which many viewers may disagree with me as Nolan has smartly justified in Inception.If you love war movies, go ahead. But don't indulge yourself much. Because it is the same scenes you have seen before.My Significant digit score: 5.5/10",5,6,10,6 August 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Title must be misleading but...
","The movie may be titled Captain America but it is in fact, a full fledged Avengers film with all key characters getting equal roles.Ice action packed movie..I felt like doing some action in theater. Insect guys were great..I mean ant man and Spiderman..Spiderman is just a teenage boy..but Tony Stark can convince any one..not a big deal. Antman becomes faint man and his grown up powers u can watch further in Jack and the bean stalk. Scarlet witch powers are all purple purple...don''t ask how she got her powers. Even powerless fighters like black widow picks up fight. She is least occupied because she doesn't have to sing and seduce with the hulk. Besides, it has one of the best action sequence seen in any superhero movie so far. On the tech front, the movie scores full marks for its outstanding CGI and visual effects. In short, a film not to be missed!",7,2,8,25 May 2016

It is not only about superpowers but about love commitment, compassion and sacrifice. Tony Stark removes his ego and Steve Rogers finally got what he wanted.The only con of this movie was the running time. The three hours could have been scrapped or at least an interval to go to the loo.!My score= 8.5/10",8,5,10,29 April 2019

Twilight," Ten years of teen romance with a twist
","I has been exactly ten years since the home page review and I would like to add my own as I wasn't an IMDB member at that time. Robert Pattinson may have proved his worth as an actor but he wasn't that handsome that girls are going bonkers about her. It was Kristen Stewart who has stole the show. Peter Facinelli as Dr. Carlisle Cullen played a good supporting role (Happy Birthday to you!)What about the Twilight Saga sequel rollout?
Nah!
Would have been better as a trilogy!",8,1,4,26 November 2018
Bridesmaids," Not even close to The Hangover!
","This movie has not set any standard, to be honest! It it is basically about a woman going through a really bad time in her life, and we are all supposed to find that funny, which isn'tFirst, the main focus will be Kristen Wiig- she blew me away in this film. Not only is she consistently and uniquely funny, but her character is surprisingly well-developed, more than the script itself. Few women possess the comic timing like hers and an ability to be cute and awkward at the same time which is so required for being the main protagonist. In addition, three scenes- The argument with the 13-year old customer at the store, the airplane scene and the fight with Melissa McCarthy are absolutely classic. Finally, the story isn't neither ground-breaking nor revolutionary in any terms; the film ends up being quite heartfelt and even rather sentimental in places. The stomach flu scenes in the bathroom and on the street were an absolute embarrassment. It tries to be derivative from the stupid standard comedy of Hollywood, and ends up more being a black comedy/dramedy.",5,0,2,25 July 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," A nice comeback from Anthony Russo to start the summer!
","A moment to rejoice! Welcome to Phase 3 of the MCU. First things first, clever writing from the Russo brothers.After a long time (since Spidey's Homecoming) the critics are totally in sync with me. Last month I watched Black Panther, and thought it was media-hyped! But today, I found something refreshing. This is the best Avengers assembly ever made!I watched A:IW in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the galaxy, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a slight chopping of the picture. The images are larger than life. Although they don't confuse the eye but I am still having a strain. Along with 12,000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!It may have taken 10 years and 18 movies, but the superheroes have shown redemption. This may have room in the hall of fame!Spider-man is just a teenage boy but yes,Tony Stark can convince any one and it was watching both of them together again. Thor appreciates Roger's beard. And the suits even support the tone of the film.Some people in the theater started crying in the end, but I didn't. I don't want to spoil anything, so save your bucks for this blockbuster. Expect a few BO records to be broken and don't forget to watch the end credits. My significant digit score: 8.5/10",8,2,5,26 April 2018
Aladdin," An insult to the PC game and the animated feature and still 7.2/10?
","Too kiddish and disappointing! Like Cinderella, this film utterly fails to understand what made the original so great to begin with. It is not that I have an issue with musicals, in fact I loved Enchanted. But in this live adaption, there is no character development at all.
Jafar wasn't even looking a villain, just an unnecessary evil. Another forced feminist goal - Jasmine to be a Sultan- was it in the game/animation (1992)? What about the score department. Can't they bring classical music instead of making this a modern high school musical?One thing Disney is always great. And that is visuals! What happened? You could sense the artificial background and can easily sense the green chromatic screen used. I hope they don't bring out a sequel, better make a TV series instead!",4,3,4,29 August 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," It is an okay film, but nothing hugely spectacular except for the IMAX screen and hence easily forgettable!

Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!I feel people like me went only to see Jack Sparrow and the awesome visuals. The movies is Depp's recovery and comeback movie as all of his films have become flops between Stranger Tides (2011) and Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017).The story seems to be written as it goes along, so you lose track of what's going on and who's doing what and why we even care. The jokes have become all stale now.The good news was at two hours and twenty minutes, this one being the shorter films in the series. The bad news is this aging franchise has long overstayed its welcome. There is a lot to like about this movie, but unfortunately it's all the stuff we've seen before.My significant digit score: 6.3/10",6,1,6,28 May 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Is this really the last installment?
","I think the best moments in the X-Men franchise have always been when the big action is fueled by really strong character work, and grounded by the themes about prejudice that have always made these characters resonate.Even Peters and Michael Fassbender did a fantastic job. Slow motion rescue operation by Evan Peters was full of entertainment. Guest appearance by Wolverine was nice.I didn't cry but I got a little bit emotional, especially when looking at Fassbender's face. Sophie Turner and Jennifer Lawrence were the stars who co-stared very well. Sophie was sweet and saucy while Jen was looking hot and sexy.Movie starts with promising note on the backdrop of Egypt, Pyramid and first mutant. First half was better one and Second was unable to carry momentum due to less effectiveness of Apocalypse and four horsemen. Bryan tried his best to sync up story with Days of Future Past and First Class. After watching X-Men: Apocalypse, I think it should have been released between FC and DoFP. It would have made more sense!",7,5,14,25 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," 54% RT score...finally the audience are understanding that they are being placed in a vicious SFX cycle!
","This review contains minor and major spoilers...First things first...We are having 3 Star War flicks in a row plus an upcoming Hans Solo movie next year and a sequel, titled Star Wars: Episode IX, is scheduled for release on December 20, 2019.. Will the craze be finally extinguished? 
What was the need of making this movie at 2 and 1/2 hours? Star Wars: The Force Awakens had a running time of 135 minutes and its flavor lasted better!Opening sequence is deja vu. We have seen this for 2 years before. Kylo Ren, Leia's son, hesitates to fire at the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother's presence but no remorse in killing his father?Leia wakes up (while being frozen to death) with the use of her Force abilities and flies back into the ship. Wow...Superwoman? She should have been in a coma (no offense!)Second, this is a continuation to 'The Force Awakens'. That's great. It picks up where Rey wants to be a Jedi. From this point, everything is so predictable. Luke initially refuses to train Rey. Have we seen this before? Yes, from The Shadow (1960); The Karate Kid (1984); Kill Bill Vol II (2004), Batman Begin's (2005); and even Creed (2015). Yes, even Balboa doesn't train boxers anymore but eventually does! Next, is Luke teaching Rey yoga? The Force lesson was more of a fluke!
A wise man once mentioned' 'When you read the the last page of the book, close it!' The sacred books were never shown to the audience. At least the writers should respect the audience's I.Q. A true Star War fan would have at least would like to have a glimpse of the book instead of being burnt! 
Last but not the least, BB8 was the saving grace of the film. And will finally Rey love Kylo? My opinion is that she will be eventually be consumed by the darkness of the Force!
What have you done Disney? Hope seems like more unreal and monotonous. After the Force Awakens, the Force is going to sleep!
If you feel the same as I do, kindly support me by counting this review as helpful!

This resulted in images projected by Dual Projectors on the Giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand each time Logan's claws grow!More of an kick-ass-action-drama film than a superhero-who-saves-the- heroine movie. The movie goes deep in the characters. The relationship between Xavier and Logan where Logan carries Xavier in his arms was thought-provoking. And Laura also knows how to fight!Finally, I wish the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to recognize and nominate Split and Logan for the Best Picture or at least Best Screenplay. James Mangold has redeemed himself as the The White Knight! A well deserved 94% RT rating!",8,0,4,5 March 2017

","In terms of acting Emma Stone is very good showing seamless transitions between opposite emotions but nothing special from Ryan Gosling, don't understand how he even got nominated for best actor.The director seems to be inspired by Bollywood numbers.

Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!First of all, trailers are suppose to give you a teaser of the film, not tell you the plot, so don't watch the trailer at all. Next, I will rate this better than Cinderella and well worth seeing in IMAX 3D, considering the 3D is much better than Kong: Skull Island. Emma Watson is perfect as Belle, I cannot imagine anyone else portraying her. I love her acting and singing and could not take my eyes off her. The cinematography is great, often springing right out of the animation and the colors are dazzling. There is a lot to like about this movie, but unfortunately it's all the stuff we've seen before.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Disney opens another chapter of action films but better than the 1st installment
","PROS: I watched Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 in IMAX with Laser and it was mind-blowing. Since the movie was especially shot for this format, it resulted in crystal clear images, projected by Dual Projectors on the Giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen along with the powerful 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand!Once again I loved Raccoon, reminded me of Puss in Boots, making you laugh when he speaks. Baby Groot was predictably adorable and almost stole the show, but of course Star Lord is the main character, leading the group of a-holes. Action scenes were great and the colors were dazzling.CONS: The story relations between every character were good but again the story focuses more on comedy/drama and less on character development, especially of the villain(s). It has the (The Batman Lego Movie + F&F) mentality and some scenes were exaggerated but again Marvel fans would not mind.Verdict: The music? Well you can listen the GOTG Vol.2 songs over and over again and they all works perfectly in the context of the movie!My significant digit score: 6.8/10",7,0,2,6 May 2017
Thor," Nice and not bad!
","Easily one of the best looking Marvel movies so far. I was never a big Thor fan in the comics but this movie had me locked in. Overall i think this movie shines thanks to the cast. Some people may feel that Nat was showing her emotions a little bit more.Otherwise, the chemistry b/w Chris and Nat made me to have feelings for her!I think the script writers tried to show that Earth is a place where is a place to correct your attitude. And ATTITUDE is 100 (add the letters!). The only grey area seems that the last action scenes(bi-frost) was looking artificial and SFX a bit blurry. It takes its place among the top super hero films Marvel has done now that they are in control.",8,0,1,28 January 2013
Joker," Don't overthink like a Marvel critic.
","How many times you feel for a super-villain? Joker, yes Joker. Every generation deserves its Joker. And this time, we got something so refreshing. If you want to see a non-fiction super-villain flick, go for Joker.If Marvel does the combo movies right, it is DC who triumphs over Marvel when it comes to solo. More of an art film than visuals dazzling from the silver screen. This is not a dazzling Avengers, so don't expect too many visuals.This really shows how the gap between rich and poor. It shows class in today's mass production. It depicts social norms in today's society. Even my deepest secrets! As Harvey Dent mentioned in TDK - 'The world is cruel'.You almost feel for the Joker, be it his groaning, moaning or whining. Even the hysterical laughing (some people even started laughing hysterically after watching this film!) Seductive and psychotic -Totally dark amusement!This is a prequel to taglines such as 'Why so serious'. And the best part is that the director didn't copy Ledger's accent. If Heath Ledger won the Oscar, posthumously, then Pheonix should get the award himself and also this movie should win the Best Adapted screenplay award.A tight slap to hard-core Marvel fans who think Venom is the winner. How many solo Marvel movies has scored an IMDB score of 9.1/10 in the opening weekend? Too bad this is a stand-alone film. Sequel, please!",8,2,4,6 October 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Old wine in a new bottle
","I watched Kong in IMAX and it was fun. This resulted in images projected by Dual Projectors on the Giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand each time Kong growls and pounds his chest!The sole purpose is to set-up a supposed Kong vs. Godzilla film in the coming years, otherwise, the script is too weak, on the same sidelines of Jurassic World. No care was taken for character development. Also, it's not clear whether the focus is on the the ape or on the island itself. There is quite a bit of humor that is attempted here, but most of it comes out of nowhere and seems desperate. Samuel Jackson strikes the right tone of crazy amid the chaos, otherwise, if we check the rest of the casting crew, the acting is almost one-dimensional. The action and visuals are dazzling and immersive. Neither a sequel nor prequel, but the SFX are better, especially with Kong's CGI' close-ups. And there is no love-dove like the Naomi Watts- Kong relationship. There is some fun to be had and it's not a bad film in any way, but a film like this could have been so much better. In a nutshell, Kong: Skull Island is disposable popcorn mumbo-jumbo fare. My significant digit score: 6.4/10",6,2,5,13 March 2017
Wonder Woman," Nice but not if you have already watched the trailer or Captain America (2011) :p
","The sole purpose is to set up the Justice League movie this year, otherwise, the script is too familiar, on the same sidelines of Captain America. Not to the grand level of The Dark Knight or Logan. The trailer gave all the essence of the movie, so I would suggest that you stop watching the promos & trailers-this is the biggest spoiler! :(I saw Wonder Woman in IMAX with Laser and it was pretty nice (without any German subtitles!). This resulted in bright images, especially the war scenes, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen without chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing! :)Wonder Woman is just another superhero action flick, without explaining why she was the chosen one, giving further evidence that Jews controlling the world, from the Academy Awards to Pixar. I feel that its the movie most people should enjoy, especially the mass production who have been disappointed by DC movies over the past couple of years. Wonder Woman is played by Gal Gadot (sexy gold outfit) who I think is responsible for the critical and financial success and not the storyboard (doesn't deserves 93% RT rating!). I bet she and Chris Pine will win the Best Duo at the 2018 MTV movie awards. Mark my words! :DMy significant digit score: 6.5/10",6,1,6,7 June 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," Wish Mr. Nolan could use TDK with more intelligence and ponder!
","Some questions remain unanswered- 1) Like Batman, why is the Batmobile also weak? In Dark Knight, we see that when the Joker launches a bazooka, it flies and hits the Tumbler, but Batman is safe. In The Dark Knight Rises, when the Batplane shoots the Batmobile, it disintegrates with one simple shot! 2) Near the end, Marinda stabs Batman. I thought the suit was made of layers of meshing; what happened to the basics of Batman Begins? 3) In the 1st fight, why is Bane hitting him like a punching bag? He holds him quite comfortably in the air like a baby! 4) When Wayne jumps on a ledge and he goes for round 2, he seems to fight Bane like a toy. Now how come it becomes so simple? 5) The silliest mistake! Final Round- Wayne vs. Bane. When Bane tries to kill Batman in the final act, Catwoman appears all of a sudden and kills him like it was child's play. Why? Why it becomes so easy when we reach the end!",6,2,5,10 September 2012
Black Panther," Another Marvel media-hyped movie!
","'Best Marvel movie ever'...Really?
It looked like an Avatar/Skyfall rip-off and everything was predictable thanks to the trailer! Review: Now with Black Panther, I thought the trailer was great, so I went hoping for something better. It gets off to a kinetic start only to lose steam before blowing everything up. 3D (Beyond the screen) technology appears to be very lacking for fast attractive action fighting sequences.
The theme was seen in M:I-4 and Skyfall, where Team Black Panther have to hide and use their brains. 
The biggest fault found in Black Panther is that it does not address the whereabouts of hero origins or where we are in terms of following. Unobtanium is the valuable mineral in Avatar while vibranium is the material in Black Panther.
And 97% rating? Sheesh!",6,6,11,1 March 2018
Blade Runner," Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for being a simple classic film.
",Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? This is the book where Ridley Scott adapted this script beautifully. Very touching sci-fi flick. The best part was the ending; it brought me tears in my eyes!What Blade Runner does is reset a smooth narrative and allows the series to go into new directions. Let's hope we something innovative in Blade Runner 2049... I hope that it does not get panned by critics as we have seen previously in RoboCop and The Thing!,8,0,1,28 June 2017
Pitch Perfect 3," Pitch Perfect 3 or Charlie Angels 3?
","The songs have lost fuel. This was more of a world tour. Three week earlier, now we found out why there were singing like silly children. And now we found that why girls have low emotional intelligence. Not only the casting, as they want to gel as a group but from the director. Trish Sie just uses forced feminism all the way. And the variety show was the only saving grace.I watched this because of Hailee Steinfeld's birthday. I think I will switch to Bumblebee! What was Fat Amy doing? Being the next Karate Kid?",4,0,1,29 December 2018
Easy A," Nice treat to watch on her birthday!
","Well, I thought which movie should I see on her birthday. And I thought why not Easy A.
Emma was funny and played pranks without overacting. Love it when she sings in her weekends!",7,0,0,8 November 2018
Annihilation," Could have done better with a proper script
","It is like a serious Ghostbusters meets Arrival. Ending was over-directional. The director needs to respect the audience's EQ. Too many plot-holes...
They acted serious but wear is all the suits needed to protect yourself inside The Shimmer? Just to show that girls can also kick ass like men?Another example of forced feminism. In the end, Natalie Portman was going to be the heroine, no doubt. NP was ticking in bed like a teenager...atleast there should have been a proper bed scene!",5,0,1,4 October 2018
Incredibles 2," Meet the Incredibles!
","Better than the first Incredibles movie. I mean I watched Fantastic Four at that time and both movies resemble a lot when it comes to super-powers.
Although there was a forced-feminism act and lots of Helen Parr / Elastigirl's buttock view, the outing seemed nice. Personal issues and Superhero egoism always comes into play.
The real message I like from Dash is' Focus on what you have, so that we can come up with ideas'
I'm glad I saw the movie, but I am not waiting for a second sequel!",7,1,2,22 January 2019
Spectre," Not original but very good!
","Remember '007 is a god damn secret agent, where is his mission...just saving an old woman in an old house from an old agent?' Well not this time!I like the more serious nature of Craig's Bond generally, but it wouldn't hurt for him to have a little more fun every once in a while. With most Bonds, I'm sure that opening would have ended with the two of them in the helicopter having a great time, but I wouldn't go that far. Craig is my favorite Bond, but his characterization would be perfected with just a trace of the naughty schoolboy on the rare occasion it can break through his brooding mood. This time he's back.. Bigger and bolder! The film's opening scene, action sequences, stunt work, and cinematography are top notch, though it could not match Skyfall's caliber. Entertainment, as we all know, comes in different shapes and sizes; it can be smart, profound, intellectually stimulating and so forth – but for you your going to enjoy it!",7,0,3,26 November 2015
Her," How to celebrate New Year Eve? By watching Her!
","I was lonely at my home as everyone left to watch the fireworks. I have no girlfriend. So, I thought of watching 'Her'. This movie resonated with me. And it sure did, especially when when Samantha briefly goes offline and Theo trips in searching for her. Online, of course! You feel for Theodore all the time.Blade Runner emotions was particularly dragged but here Spike Jonze makes no mistake!
Amy Adams was really looking like Amy with no make-up.
The sexy pregnant TV Star was really so seducing...wish to see May Lindstrom in the future.
Scarlett Johansson led her sexy and seducing voice. People will find it more interesting when she moans if they have watched her past movies involving her shedding her clothes!What's next for JP after Her? Joker!",7,0,2,2 January 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Surprisingly, not BO #1!
","It has been nearly 2 weeks since I saw Fury Road, and I'm still trying to recover. It is the sort of film you forget to breathe through, much like Interstellar, but for an altogether different reason. Unrelenting from beginning to end, this post-apocalyptic saga is virtually one, long, explosive chase sequence, albeit one which seemingly has new ideas on tap. The action (i.e. the whole film) is utterly bonkers, conceptually and in execution. That writer-director George Miller and his team concocted such ferocious set pieces is impressive enough, but being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work – augmented by gritty CGI – is simply awe-inspiring. Visually it is vivid and spectacular; the searing desert landscape offering a dirt-filled grime so tangible your throat will dry up within seconds, whilst the vehicles are creative and wonderfully preposterous. The heart-pounding score by Junkie XL, in which he blends orchestral and heavy metal music, accompanies Miller's on screen splendour to create a visceral experience for both the eyes and the ears. The vehicular carnage may be the drawcard, but the committed cast elevate the overall product. Tom Hardy is savage as Max, Charlize Theron is compelling as Imperator Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult (Remember, X-Men???) is gonzo as Nux, whilst a plethora of recognisable Aussies show up in deranged cameos. There's an intensity here you just don't find in majority of the big- budgeted blockbusters; an inventiveness in all elements that drives this movie from great to mesmerizing. Miller hasn't played in the Mad Max world since the dreadful Beyond Thunderdome back in 1985, but by God he has redeemed himself, and then some. Fury Road is a rollicking ride that carves out a piece of cinematic history all for itself. Considering the wave of terrible 90's Sci-fi sequels/remakes we've had fired our way in the past few years (Terminator Salvation, RoboCop, Total Recall etc.) Fury Road's success has been more than a pleasant surprise. In short it is a grungy masterpiece.",9,3,11,27 May 2015
The Great Gatsby," Gatsby really Great?
","I never had read the book but because of Dicaprio and Decki's birthday, I thought of giving this movie a try. But to my dismay, there was no character development at all. I mean no matter how hard did Maguire tried to elevate Dicaprio's status, it all remained flat and served no purpose. Even the writers didn't cared for showing Mulligan displaying any regret after DiCaprio's death. Where was the greatness in Gatsby? He could have run an orphanage in the later half of the movie to show that: a) the movie and the book differ in each other. b) how really the movie ends in a satisfying note and surprise the audience that Gatsby was not materialistic after all.The only positive part was the soundtrack and DiCaprio's romance in the cruise boat with Mulligan.",5,0,0,27 August 2017
Sully," Thought provoking film - See it only in IMAX with Laser!
","A gripping movie based on real life events and is definitely worth a watch - go ahead and watch this movie without any hesitation. This was the 1st time that a FULL movie was shot using the Brand New Arri Alexa IMAX 65mm cameras, which only a few directors can or are licensed to use by IMAX! This resulted in Crystal clear images, projected by Dual Projectors on the Giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, along with the powerful 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand!Hats off to Hanks and Eastwood for mesmerizing story telling of reality based incident with very ease. Use of flashbacks was brilliant concept for an engaging audience till the climax. Great performance from Eckhart and Linney, too. Simulation thing added some entertainment in the second half. Hanks trusts his inner soul rather than the machine.Eastwood's last directorial effort American Sniper carried too many scripts - stringed with too many sentiments, but with Sully he has redeemed himself.",8,0,1,21 September 2016
