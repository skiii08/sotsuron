United 93," United 93
","United 93 I think this is definitely one of the most difficult reviews I will write, regarding one of the most difficult films I have seen. The events of 9/11 will haunt all those who remember the day. America is still reeling from the terrible tragedy and the effects of it are too profound for me to attempt to summarize. When talk of a 9/11 movie came out I rolled my eyes. Horrible thoughts flashed through my mind imagining Hollywood would exploit another disaster by throwing teen heartthrobs into typical action scenes held together by a flimsy romance hoping to create a conventional thriller to appeal to brain dead audiences. Thankfully director Paul Greengrass has delivered a respectful, profound, emotional, and expertly crafted tale of 9/11. It is a real time account of what occurred on board United Flight 93, one of the planes hijacked on 9/11 that crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania when passengers foiled the terrorist plot. The filmmakers were smart enough to know not to exploit. They do not bring forth conclusions or attack anybody. It does not try to portray anyone of the characters in an overly flattering or degrading way, creating straightforward heroes or villains. This film takes the viewer and places them on board the plane with the rest of the passengers awaiting their impending doom.All of the passengers are based on real people, but never do we learn who they are. No background insight is exchanged, there names are never even mentioned. Only through little bits of chit-chat throughout the movie are we able to learn little if anything about them. The terrorists never talk about themselves amongst each other; they only speak of their mission. They are complete strangers, which is appropriate because on a plane you would not know anyone. The cast of unknown actors were given studies of their real life counterparts from the family members of the victims. Greengrass was then able to partially improvise some of the events. The story also covers events surrounding U.S Military Air Traffic Controllers; real Air Traffic Controllers were used for these scenes. Greengrass films his story like a documentary, using his hand-held cams like a fly on the wall; his style of direction is perfect for the movie. The tension that the story builds up rivals that of the greatest thrillers. The audience brings all their outside knowledge into the theater and knows how the flight will end and all the events that will follow, the characters do not and the ultimate dramatic irony is now set.I find it difficult to analyze the emotions I felt during my viewing, because the experience kicked up such a whirlwind of them. I feel there is much I want to say, but am having trouble doing such. I will be damned surprised if a 2006 movie comes along that is as well made and powerful. United 93 is a movie going experience I will not soon forget, I suspect everyone who sees it will feel the same way. The climax is especially haunting functioning as a primal, brutal scene that looks into the most basic of all human actions and emotions like few films have ever, as normal men and women fight up an airplane isle armed with makeshift weapons, kicking, punching, scratching, screaming, crying, choking, blinded with survival instincts, as a man throws down a piece of metal into the ground with the intent of killing a fellow being while screaming his God's name in praise. If that does not stir you up, I do not know what could",10,1,5,11 May 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," One of the Best Comedies of the Decade
","Who would have thought that a first time screenwriter (Michael Arndt) and first time directors (husband and wife Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris) would create that comedy? Definitely not me or anyone else who saw Little Miss Sunshine, it surprised the heck out of me and is easily my personal favorite movie from this year.It tells the story of the dysfunctional Hoover family and their VW road trip to get their dopey yet adorable seven year old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) to compete in the Californian Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. What makes it so special? For one, the characters, while somewhat stereotypical, are acted and written to perfection. There is the cranky crude Grandpa (Alan Arkin) battling a heroin addiction. There is the miserable angst-ridden teen Dwayne (Paul Dano) who has taken a vow of silence and prefers to write his statements in a notepad when forced to communicate with others. There is the hard working Mother (Toni Collete), trying her hardest to take care of her family and not have a mental breakdown herself. Her husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a wannabe self help guru whose constant words of 'encouragement' only manage to alienate himself from his children. Much discussion has been had over the casting of comedian Steve Carrell as the Uncle Frank, a Proust scholar who is taken in by the Hoover's after attempting suicide. Like every other actor in the film he is perfectly cast delivering all the necessary moments of comedy while still bringing to life a flawed, interesting, and likable character. Finally there is Olive, whose only flaw is that she has the unattainable dream of becoming a beauty queen. It is also worth noting that the she delivers the funniest line in the entire screenplay. I won't give it away, but when you hear it you will know what I am talking about.The story and characters give the movie an ample amount of comedic potential and it is all fully utilized. Everything from the family banter to the deadpan look one character gives another to the major set pieces deliver big laughs. The comedy is intelligent and dark yet at the same time accessible enough for a wide audience. Heck, if it was not for the language it would be the perfect movie to take the kids too. It is all about sticking to and looking out for your family no matter what while professing the always popular moral of 'true beauty lies on the inside'. A handful of moments are surprisingly emotional, so much so that if your eyes get misty you won't know if it is from laughing to much or simply viewing genuinely moving cinema. The word gets tossed around a lot these days but no film I have seen is more worthy of the being placed in the sub-genre that is 'dramady'. This summer movie season was one of the worst in recent memory; filled with movies that I thought were either not all that great or left me very disappointed. I am very thankful this incredibly wonderful gem was discovered by me mid-august. I really cannot praise Little Miss Sunshine enough. See it on DVD you guys and place it amongst your favorite comedies, I know it is one of mine.",10,1,4,20 September 2006
Children of Men," One of the best science fiction films in recent times!
","Happy New Year! I'm hoping 2007 will give us all some great cinema. Not too much though, because I still have not seen all must see movies from 2006. I guess I will have to try and catch up on them now, because man I'm glad I saw Children of Men! Indeed a hard film to describe but I will do my best. The story takes place in the post apocalyptic future of 2027. Post apocalyptic because for nearly 30 years women have been unable to reproduce and absolutely no one can figure out why. People of the world have lost all hope and civil wars have broken out across the globe. Our protagonist is Theo (Clive Owen) a bitter depressed man with a dark past. He has accepted humanities impending doom and seems content to rot away with the rest of the world. That is until his ex-lover (Julianne Moore) gets him involved with a group of revolutionaries led by Luke whose girlfriend happens to be very pregnant. Obviously this is a huge deal and Theo has plans to escort her to the safety of a top secret scientific facility where research could supply the right people with the answers to save humanity. Unfortunately this task is made much more difficult when the whole worlds a battlefield and few people can be trusted. It sounds depressing, but 'Children of Men' is really a hopeful and human story of triumph and sacrifice.Directed by Alfonso Cuaron (Harry Potter & the Prizoner of Azkaban), here he establishes himself as a master of his craft. The world he has created here is one of the bleakest, realistic, and fully realized universes in the medium of science fiction. He lets the action unfold using some of the most incredible camera-work I have ever seen. There is a section near the end which has Clive Owen racing through a bullet-ridden battlefield and into a bombed out building to rescue the girl. The 9 minute sequence is done without any takes and it blows my mind how Cuaron pulled it off. The action scenes are as intense and exciting as anything I have seen from a legend like Spielberg (which says a lot, he is me and Mike's favorite director.) 'Children of Men' is a tour de force of direction.I know what the skeptics must be thinking know. 'Don't be stupid, I only care about the story!' Well you are in luck because Children of Men tells it really good. Clive Owen is excellent as Theo, a man who instantly gained my curiosity and sympathy. His transformation from hardened cynic to noble hero is completely believable. Julianne Moore is one of my favorite actresses and I wish she was in this more. There is also the great British actor Sir Michel Caine as Theo's old mentor. He manages to steal all the scenes he is in. The rest of the cast is very effective as well, though I have not seen many of them in other films. No problem though, it is easier to suspend disbelief and be caught up in the story that way. The acting keeps the films emotional center in place saving it from becoming a mere technical exercise. Some viewers may complain about the lack of closure involved in the end but it did not bother me at all. By the time the credits rolled I felt emotionally satisfied while still having much to think about. Like many great works of hard sci-fi, and indeed great films, ambiguity is one of its greatest strengths.That aside, 'Children of Men' still remains a heartfelt, unique, and thrilling cinematic experience. Bottom line: One of the best science fiction films in recent times.",10,3,8,9 January 2007
The Departed," The Departed
","Yeah so everyone who knows anything about movies has heard the fuss being made over the new Martin Scorsese movie The Departed starring Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon. Many critics are saying it is Scorsese's best directed movie since the 1990's classic Goodfellas, and it deserves to sweep the Oscars this year. I have had the pleasure of seeing it twice during its opening weekend and I strongly agree with the above praise.The Departed is an American re-telling of a Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs and it has a very complex plot but here is a general summary from IMDb. 'In South Boston, the state police force is waging war on Irish-American organized crime. Young undercover cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio giving some of his best work to date) is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello (the legendary Jack Nicholson). While Billy quickly gains Costello's confidence, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon, also at his finest) a hardened young criminal who has infiltrated the police department as an informer for the syndicate, is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit. Each man becomes deeply consumed by his double life, gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of the operations he has penetrated. But when it becomes clear to both the mob and the police that there's a mole in their midst, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy-and each must race to uncover the identity of the other man in time to save himself. But is either willing to turn on the friends and comrades they've made during their long stints undercover?' Like I said above it is a very complex story, which is fitting because the two moles in each organization lead very complex lives. It is a thematically rich yet wildly entertaining movie about honor, duty, loyalty, and identity. It is not just an action/crime flick. The movie breezes by at a pace that feels like much less then its 2 hour and 30 minute running time. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the best acting performance in the film and once again proves he is one of the finest actors of his generation. The terrific acting from the entire cast (also including Martin Sheen, Mark Whalberg, and Alec Baldwin), sharp screenplay written by William Monahan, and Martin Scorsese's brilliant direction make The Departed a masterpiece.Scorsese is one of the very best American directors of all time. With this film he is exploring the gritty mobster territory that got him recognized over 30 years ago with his breakout hit Mean Streets (1973), yet at the same time telling a fresh and interesting story to make The Departed unique from his other work (unlike 1995's Casino which is basically just a Goodfellas ripÂ–off). I really think he will finally get a long overdue Oscar for best directing, an award he should have received multiple times in the past. The Departed will continue to be discussed in film circles for the next few months until Oscar night comes around, here is hoping it will dominate the ceremonies. It is one of the best films of the current decade as well as one of Scorsese's best films.",10,1,1,27 October 2006
V for Vendetta," V for Vendetta
","In the 1980's, famous comic writer Alan Moore wrote what is considered one of his best graphic novels and a masterpiece of sequential storytelling, V for Vendetta. Now it is adapted for film with a screenplay written by the Wachowski Brothers. Honestly, I was not looking forward to this movie when the buzz around it started. I did not fall in love with The Matrix like everyone else, sure the action and effects were amazing but the story and characters did nothing for me. I was expecting V to be even less thrilling in my eyes. It had been pushed back from a November release to March, Alan Moore had disowned it, and the trailer, which featured a bald Natalie Portman and hero that looked like Michael Jackson, was awful. My expectations could not have been lower.Well, color me shocked because I liked V for Vendetta quite a bit! Let me make one thing very clear: This is not an action picture. The advertisements and other people might label it as such, but do not go into it expecting that. I can only really thing of maybe 3 short fight scenes in the entire thing. The story takes place in an alternate reality futuristic tyrannical Britain, V first appears as a brooding vigilante who saves Evey (Natalie Portman) one night from police who were going to rape and kill her. From there she becomes a part of his schemes to topple the oppressive government. I really do not want to give much more away, but I will say it becomes much more interesting then it sounds. The character of V is the driving force behind the movie, which is odd because we never really get to know much about who he (or her) is under the Guy Fawkes mask. The past of the character is explained throughout the film along with how the dictator came into power, but the exact identity of V is never revealed. I suppose it remains up to the viewer to decide. I have a few theories myself and I would love to share them if this was not a non-spoiler review. He was interesting because I do not believe the audience will agree with all of his actions. He is an assassin killing those who wronged him without mercy, as well as a terrorist blowing up famous landmarks and buildings in London. Is V a terrorist or freedom fighter? Would an A for Anarchy be more appropriate? Whatever people think of him, he is no doubt one of the more intriguing protagonist movies have recently offered. Another compelling character in the film was Detective Finch who has been assigned to track down V. In his search he finds the truth and in one of my favorite scenes predicts the chilling consequences of V's actions. Of course, there is the geek favorite Miss. Portman. Even with a shaved head and lame accent she is incredibly beautiful to watch.V for Vendetta is a movie with a hell of a lot of ideas, even if not all of them are fleshed out. I found it scary how a story written some 20 years ago could hold so much relevance in the world we live in today. It is a commentary on political oppression and revolution told while bringing up subjects such as nuclear weapons, government testing, corrupt government figures, terrorism, and religious believes, and homosexuality. It does not always make sense, but it is always absorbing. I had never read Moore's original work, but I might get around to checking it out after this movie. I suspect some people expecting a non stop action romp will be disappointed, so do not go in expecting such. Be prepared for a film that will throw a lot of ideas your way and expect you to sort through them and find a message for yourself. In the finale of V for Vendetta I was not assaulted with cheap thrills, but a thoughtful and explosive exclaimation point to all the thoughts the film shoved into my brain. Anything that can do that is something worth seeing.",8,0,2,22 March 2006
