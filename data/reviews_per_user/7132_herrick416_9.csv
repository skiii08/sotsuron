Vertigo," Talk about a control freak ...
","Thank you 'JWA' for your 2007 review that nails it for me. I don't need to say much more than reference this review that find Vertigo to be one of very few Hitchcock movies that fizzles when it's trying to be hot and exactly as JWA observed ... but I didn't realize until his brilliant review that Jimmy Stewart was just plain wrong in this role. He was stiff and pathetic at the end when his character could have emerged with manhood restored but instead becomes shrill and plain ridiculous and yes embarrassing. It's almost comical the war movies back even presented truly neurotic behavior as if the other characters and the audience as well should be sympathetic to stalking, manipulation and control to the point of obsession. In Vertigo we have inexcusably weak to inexcusably agressive almost sadistic yet shrill and we're asked to excuse what isn't any fun at all.",4,0,5,11 November 2019
Wind River," Spellbinding with a revelation that's long overdue ..
","You won't go wrong. This gem caught me by surprise. It was so good - so layered with subtleties that I rewatched many scenes to fully grasp them. This is a brilliantly grim glimpse at an under reported reality but it doesn't convey anything that doesn't grab you in the process. It doesn't preach. It just is. A gripping deeply revealing look into each character, some of whom matter and some are appropriately dismissed as beasts we don't want to know. There are villains and then there are clear-headed purposeful monsters in this world. There's also incredible kindness and courage. Without the presence of the latter, I wouldn't recommend this movie as passionately. I do recommend it.",9,1,2,20 April 2019
Match Point," A clever endeavor and never a dull moment...
","Can't people just enjoy a suspenseful movie without the need to proclaim moral superiority Nobody's on the edge of their seat waiting for your good/bad assessment of the characters nor is that relevant as to the talent of the players. IT'S a MOVIE it's not your in laws . The storyline is familiar, but Woody Allen's magical touch keeps it anything but standard. I was glued to my seat at every rapid scene change. Beautiful cinematography-really stunning indoors and out, on top of which there's an engrossing plot that forgives some mediocre acting. These characters were fun to watch, especially slightly awkward Chloe and her slightly pompous brother who seemed natural in their upper crust roles. Mummy and father were also good. The tennis pro Chris and struggling actress from America Nola were my least favorite-not just the characters but the acting as well. I love Scarlett Johansson (since 'Horse Whisperer') and she shines in understated or comedic roles. Here I didn't believe her. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is just doesn't convince me either. I haven't seen him in anything else I can remember. If it weren't for these 2 I'd have rated the movie at 10.
Woody Allen makes anything he touches crisp and meaningful. 'Match Point' is a window into human nature and its predictable consequences turning into unexpected consequences with fascinating results. And yet is doesn't end there... This is one of those movies that demands you leave your mind open about what you've seen that you may see differently later.",8,0,0,5 April 2020
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Beautifully said by 'anger and what it begets..'
",Rarely if ever have I read a member review so beautifully written that by doing any more than referring to it risks losing what is perfect as is. The message is a familiar one but sometimes a string of words in concert with another and another rises above a page and announces something original unique and painfully relevant that some may consider it life changing. Attitude changing at least and isn't that what attitudes are for - changing. Thank you to that person who reviewed this a while ago-in 2018. I'm always a little late in getting to movies. Never too late to experience what 'anger and what it begets' has positively nailed. (See the review dated 17 February 2018).,9,0,0,29 April 2020
The Machinist," Take a deep breath ...
",Check this one out and enjoy the twists and turns and the lack of plot holes. Christian Bale is stupendous in this as is his sweet nurturing nighttime companion Jennifer Jason Leigh. This is a wonderful dark drama with some mystery inside a unique story. This film tells me why I'm so rarely disappointed by independent films. This is a heavy gem. Don't miss it.,9,0,1,19 December 2018
Don't Breathe," Escapism...you betcha
","Having read these mixed reviews but only after seeing the film, I share a similar reaction-negative and positive. Plot holes yes, farfetched, muddled, murky reality, lazy explanations, gratuitous gore, unlikeable characters (all but one*) behaving badly, a wild twist, sloppily resolved. Yet for 88 minutes I remained on the edge of wherever I first landed when the movie began. I didn't move or speak until the last segment when I started shouting at the characters who were left. *Rocky was sensational in an almost comical horror flick that didn't feel like wasted time for me.",5,0,0,30 September 2019
Identity," Lots of entertaining twists and great fun to dissect on 2nd viewing...
","This used to be one of my all time favorite movies because the plot made my head spin but no tremendous holes or insults to the viewer. Great cast, all of whom are necessary to complete what whips into extra high gear as the unfolding begins. I had to watch it again almost immediately to fully absorb an explanation that is anything but familiar or overdone. Not for me anyway. Although seeing it again after over a decade surprised me as to how what constitutes 'great' has changed, it was nonetheless gripping and fascinating if just a little bit far fetched. Not a few hours you'll want back - enjoy!",8,0,1,3 May 2020
Thirteen Days," Oh. Is that all...? TERRIFIC FILM.
","Reminded throughout 'who KNEW it could be so hard ..? I don't know how I managed to miss this terrific movie until now. But here we are again, superpowers jockeying for position to claim peace. Back then the 2 superpowers, The United States and the Soviet Union where in at least one we know cooler heads prevail and quite possibly both. But so many near-misses
too many excuses to dump diplomacy that could have landed in mutual destruction and cost us the planet. As JFK so rightly and humbly put it 'I think we both won ...'
Rarely is a history lesson as entertaining as it is factual. I've learned that apart from the necessary embellishments this stuck pretty close to true. President of the United States, his Attorney General and his Chief Advisor are jobs where the wishy-washy need not apply nor the hotheads yearning for war to ignite. These 3 men may have argued each other's logic but never in question their shared deeply principled commitment to exhaust all options before going to war. Each took a turn at carrying out another's scenario to its natural conclusion where again they'd arrive on the unthinkable. There were others who used the unthinkable as a resort without stating the reality that it's our collective last resort. These men epitomize the great America where bullheadedness aims for peace and we the people admire (and therefore elect) a brilliance in intellect, character and tone necessary to keep it and us intact. Yes wishing for something of substance and not swamp to return. Why not be principled again.",8,1,2,26 January 2020
Green Book," Heartwarming and Funny. Could have ended half hour ago ...
","The only reason I don't rate this movie higher is only because it had 4-5 beautiful places to end having made its point yet stayed real to the 50's ... stayed real to the reality of today. We know both characters evolve. That's not giving anything away. And they do it brilliantly. They're are breakthroughs near the end that suffice for an appropriate ending but instead of knowing when to end it, got Disney-like. That didn't ruin anything. I loved the message and the movie. But someone might have left the mystery of a country on its slow journey to decency. That would have maintained the lump in my throat. It was still worth seeing.",7,0,1,5 April 2019
