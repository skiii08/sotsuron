Come and See," Come and See
","'Come and See' is a beautiful film by Elim Klimov, and a smart masterpiece way to pay tribute to the 40th anniversary Russian win over Germany forces. The cinematography of the movie made me react as in to how many people were hurt during the making of the film, but also during the actual war during War World II. It is brilliant to see how Floyra changes in front of the audience, first his innocence, and then his mind. The film does a well job in depicting how brutal war is, and Floyra's decision to stay in war at the end, even though he knows how brutal it is. In addition, by Klimov emphasizing on the story of this little village, the micros coping aspect makes the impact of the film bigger because it can represent any other village that was going under the same circumstances in Russia. The images of the film are devastating, and there is so much to absorb every second of the film.",9,1,1,10 February 2012
