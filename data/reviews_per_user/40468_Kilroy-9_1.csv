Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Happily Surprised
","I, sadly, expected Mr Lucas to sell out diehard fans such as myself. I was surprised to discover that he didn't. There were several inside jokes, hints, allusions. I was also very pleased with the imagination of the film. Senator Palpatine could have merely risen to power instead of the intricate way in which he is doing it.  Also he has left several things that we need to question and speculate.  Great job Mr. Lucas, Keep up the good work!",10,0,0,20 June 1999
