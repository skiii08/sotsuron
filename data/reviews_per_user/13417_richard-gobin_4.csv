The New World," Beautiful film
","Having been pleasantly surprised that this film did not have the usual Disney-like take on it, I watched with full attention and in the end left feeling that I had just watched a beautifully-made movie. The love story was honest as it was innocent and Q'Orianka Kilcher's portrayal as Pocahontas was brilliant for someone that slipped under my radar of rising young stars. Her character portrayal reflects the innocence of a young indigenous Indian and also the transformation into a western cultured lady. Colin Farrel and Christian Bale also added great performances. I highly recommend this film and it will definitely make its way into my personal movie collection.",10,3,7,18 January 2007
Grave of the Fireflies," An excellent film that left me in tears.
","I have no choice but to give this animated masterpiece a 10 out of 10. I had never seen it when it came out and decided to get it. I had heard it was very sad, so I knew it might not be a kiddies movie. But boy was I taken on an emotional overdrive! The story so compelling about a young boy and his little sister trying to stay alive in war-torn Japan changed the way I feel about war and children as a whole. Any movie that could bring about such a profound change in me will forever be in the upper echelons in my favorite movie collection. Kudos to every single person involved in making the movie. The story so deep and the sadness even deeper. And even sadder still is that it happened during those dark years and still happening now.",10,0,1,9 August 2013
The Conjuring," A let down of a movie (minor spoilers)
","I went to see The Conjuring today and I was disappointed. Having seen so many horror movies I guess I am jaded. Three-quarters of the film was filled with cheap scares- doors opening and closing, creaking this and that. It resembled a cheap rip-off of The Amityville Horror and The Shining. Only the loudness of these effects made some people jump- and that was just volume. Having said that the only redeeming quality was the last part of the movie- during the possession of the Mother.. Even if these manifestations really occurred at least the writers could have injected some artistic freedom and make it more spooky. If this was based on true accounts, then real horror is pretty boring.",5,3,7,31 July 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," This movie deserves to be shot....in the head!
","What can I say? Again, another nonsensical movie. What started out as just another teen horror movie descended into a totally mind-numbing, makes-no-sense-film. None of the characters were likable. The cheap sex shots deserved a yawning and the whole plot was more convoluted than all the Matrix movies put together. Even Thor and Signorney Weaver could not put this Humpty Dumpty film together. The idea of an ancient god needing a sacrifice to prevent it from destroying the Earth? Come on, it was not even interesting enough to make it 'unique'. The only redeeming quality was when the creatures and monsters had their feast on the scientists. So my 3 stars The Cabin in The Woods was given, and that was way too liberal for what it really deserved.",3,3,8,16 August 2012
