Requiem for a Dream," Impressive Treatment, Much Less Impressive Subject Matter
","I found the artistic elements of this film impressive.  The acting was terrific--two elements that are often underdeveloped.  My complaint is simple, and I expect I am in the minority: I want art to inspire; in the classical sense, I want art to put a spirit into me.  I want to experience a Muse whom I do not know.  Inspiration can, and often does, deal with horrific and troubling subject matter.  Having seen the The Basketball Diaries; Train Spotting; Traffic, etc.  Requiem for a Dream offers me very little beyond the appreciated art direction and acting already mentioned. 5 being a film that pleases, I give RFAD a 6/10.",5,0,1,14 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Among the best of 'fun' movies . . .
","A great deal of skill and talent went into this production.  However, this movie is a spectacle; it is meant to thrill its audiences--which it does quite well.  All the actors are capable of exploring the nuances of character development, but this movie, however skillfully adapted, is not concerned with such matters.  I did not identify with any of the characters, although I did feel some sympathy, enough to remain interested for the three hours.  It could have been even better if it had more fully tapped into the myth of good, evil, and the battle of the will.  I rate LOTR: 8 out of 10, by far my highest score of any movie released this year.",9,0,0,21 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," Come on folks--meet them half way!
","It should go without saying that viewers are drawn to (and repelled from) the Matrix movies for a combination of reasons: special effects, action, theme, story, philosophy, soundtrack, cast, etc.  In important ways, both Reloaded and Revolutions contribute to a great trilogy.  Each movie raises bold questions that have preoccupied philosophers--classical and contemporary--and that deserve a place in our present consideration.  It seems to me that a key component to an appreciation of this trilogy is a modest exercise in suspending one's disbelief.  The campy dialogue, cheesy love scenes, and over-the-top epic battles can be stumbling blocks if one insists on staying rooted in skepticism--if one insists that the movie-makers come to him/her, rather than offering to meet them half-way. The elements just listed are also found throughout the world's best classic literature: The Epic of Gilgamesh, The Illiad & Oddyssy, The Bible, Paradise Lost, etc.  We all can think of ways we think the movies could be better.  No one will argue that a movie production team who places special effects at the top of its list is going to fall short in other crucial areas (character & plot development).  It reads as if most imdb.com members had unwarranted expectations of the sequels in the trilogy, and communicated their disappointment through their votes.  Unfortunately, this distorts these movies merit.  Currently, Reloaded has an IMDB average of 7.3 and Revolutions 6.7--compared to The Matrix at 8.5.  It is my belief that a fairer, more reflective audience would rate these movies much more closely. My judgment, for what it's worth--in order of their release 10-9-9.  I express my gratitude to  the hordes of artists and laborers who were involved in the awesome task.",9,2,4,8 November 2003
American Beauty," #1 on the list of over-rated movies
","Aside from some creative technique, and interesting character development, American Beauty is altogether unremarkable.  I find it typical, Hollywood didacticism: 'American suburban life is not as good as it seems.'  Ooooo, how profound!  Whose life is?  As an urbanite who is quite aware of the pros and cons of urban and suburban living--I was disappointed that the film's social message was so one-sided and shallow.  More than any other ranking I've witnessed on imdb.com, I believe American Beauty's current position at #28 reveals much more about the voters than it does the film.  Have the guts to point out the emperor is naked!  5 being a film that is worth either the time or the money--but not both--American Beauty barely squeaks by: 5/10.",5,2,4,9 November 2003
Ocean's Eleven," slightly amuzing, ultimately disappointing
","The impressive cast of Ocean's Eleven drew me to see the movie on its opening weekend.  However, common sense and past experience should have told me that there was no way sufficient time could be given to the development of the several characters without shifting emphasis from the plot; it seems that when a film bills this many well known, talented actors, the best for which one can hope is either a well developed plot or a well developed cast of characters--in this case we get neither.  What a shame too.  Garcia, Pitt, and Damon have tremendous depth to offer this film.",6,0,1,8 December 2001
Three Colors: Blue," Courage
","In light of the many glowing reports on this film, it takes a little courage to admit that beyond a few impressive story telling techniques and some memorable uses of color, Blue was altogether unremarkable.  After the inginuity, one's audience still must invest in the story, or at least in how one is telling it.  I have nothing to gain by criticizing those who appreciate the technical and artistic nuances of this film, but Blue was produced for a select sub-culture.  To the lay-film-lover, it was foreign on two fronts.  4/10",4,10,24,17 April 2002
