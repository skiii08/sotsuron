Your Name.," What seems to be a silly premise evolved into something even more trifling. But with its unbearable charm, it worked astonishingly well.
","Your Name (Kimi No Na Wa) tells the story of two teenagers with vastly different backgrounds. One is a boy who lived in Tokyo and has the word 'city' described all around him. One is a girl who lived in rural town far from technology and anything interesting. One morning, somehow, they found out that they have swapped bodies. Together, they must help each other find solution in daily life problems, and solve the mystery of the reason why this whole conundrum started.This may sound like your typical body-swap romantic comedy situation, but you may find yourself on the wrong side of the spectrum as this movie takes you into an incredible journey. With a storytelling so divine, complex, yet understandable, this movie captures the essence of what romantic comedy movies have lost nowadays, a heart and a charm to lure you in.Japanese animation movies tend to have a bit of a stereotype, but the movie successfully shown very little of that. Transitioning from one scene to the other effortlessly, Radwimps deserves an incredible applause for their talents in the movie, as every song and every score fits perfectly to the scene currently shown.Although the movie does end in a predictable way, the voyage to that predictable end is more than enough to keep you satisfied. There are some usage of stock characters and several clichés throughout, something that maybe will drive some of the audiences away or cloud their judgment. But beside all that, the story is still original and well executed.What seems to be a silly premise evolved into something even more trifling. But with its unbearable charm, it worked astonishingly well.",9,91,130,25 September 2016
Train to Busan," Exhilarating from departure to arrival, Train to Busan is a breakthrough in balancing emotion and fright.
","A daughter and her estranged father board a train to Busan to see her mother. What seems to be a peaceful ride soon turn into a nightmare as a zombie outbreak manages to make their way inside the train. One by one, passengers fell victim to the pandemic. Can they make it to Busan?Korean movies always knows best to tug at their audience's heartstrings. Whether it's family drama, life problems, or just full blown tearjerkers. Korean movies is also home to some of the most terrifying, spine-chilling, and effective jumpscare usage in horror movies of all time. This movie captures both aspects successfully. The scoring in this movie is just right, and the visuals provided with each shot is definitely jaw-dropping.The movie does lack in several aspects, such as inexplicable plot points, questionable decisions by the characters, and some lagging in storytelling by the latter half of the movie. Good thing is, the negative aspects are only apparent on subsequent watches, and the movie still provides good entertainment sprinkled with logical backstories and likable/unpleasant characters for you to root to survive or die.All in all, Train to Busan is an exhilarating experience, and a fresh take on zombie movie tropes.",9,4,10,16 September 2016
About Time," Interesting premise, but overall messy.
","Tim is your usual twenty somethings: bad with women, awkward, and miserable in life. When Tim reaches the age of 21, his dad told him that the men in his family can travel back in time, in any desired time during his life on Earth. With this new ability, will his life start to get any better?Now that's an interesting premise right there. Unfortunately, it all went downhill so fast than you can imagine. There are so many plot holes and rules that are left unexplained, so many wacky expositions that just didn't work, and bloated clichés one after another.The movie is somewhat salvaged, however, by the main lead's performance (Domhnall Gleeson). Rachel McAdams did an okay job by being the main lead's romance interest, and so does Bill Nighy. The tone is consistent and the soundtrack is somewhat tolerable, but that's all there is to it.It is a good movie for a couple night, but I advice you to watch for several minutes and just go have sex or sleep immediately.",5,0,2,21 August 2016
Begin Again," The general theme and tone of the movie is excellent, yet it's still predictable.
","A man is currently trying to regain everything he messed up: his glory in the music industry, his crumbling family, and his passion. Things start to look up when he drunkenly stumbles into a woman singing her heart out in a bar. There, he knows he can regain everything back in his life, including helping out the woman's problems.Musical dramas tend to oversaturate stuff and bore the audience with the long musical numbers. However, Begin Again is a carefully composed musical drama, with infectious earworms and emotional moments spread throughout the movie accordingly. Most of the musical number is meaningful and contributes something to the character development. Keira Knightly deserves points for at least try to sing, her voice may sound robotic at times but soothing nonetheless.Every movie has its flaws, and this movie has some. There are several plots that were unnecessary, weird pacing, and predictable finale. Overall, it was executed well and definitely one of the strong contenders in the musical drama genre. Perfect for a movie date.",7,0,0,6 September 2016
Bridget Jones's Diary," Despite hitting all the right notes, Bridget Jones' Diary still falls into a romantic comedy cliché.
","32-year old spinster and lunatic Bridget Jones is alone and aloof, living in London with no love to call her own. She made a resolution to start writing in a diary, promising herself to get better physically and simultaneously dealt with other life problems. Things start to change this year when she met two men that somehow gravitated towards her but despised each other's company.Romantic comedies usually suffer from the case of a predictable plot and generic characters. This movie doesn't escape those stereotypes either. Packed with a clever script and solid execution, this movie tiptoes the romantic parts and the comedic ones. Some moments were definitely a bit too sweet to be true and too wacky of a comedy, yet somehow it has all the right twists and turns of a movie that will keep you glued. Sure, it has a big unnecessary subplot just to fill the empty duration, but with a supporting cast this strong, I wouldn't mind having to take a break from all the love triangle that was going on.Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth may not have that strong of a chemistry, but throw Hugh Grant into the mix and somehow all three of them play each other off really well. Zellweger particularly went lengths for this movie, and I must applaud her for her impeccable comedic timing and sweet charm that lured me into liking her careless, clueless character.It was a sweet romantic comedy for a date night, but don't expect anything original or mind-blowing about it. It's still just a fun romantic comedy, amazingly engineered and well-acted.",8,0,0,21 September 2016
Don't Breathe," Simple, effective, and suspenseful, its noticeable flaws are hardly worth a damn to fuss about.
","Don't Breathe has a very simple premise: three burglars attempt to escape with their stolen money from a supposedly helpless victim living in a house, only to find themselves trapped and accidentally managed to uncover something dark hidden inside the house.With so many horror movies on the rise this year alone, Don't Breathe managed to score a sweet spot in one of the best. The movie successfully creates a tension that ran thick throughout the whole movie. It doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares and convoluted backstories, it relies on effective delivery of horror.The problem is, with a movie this simple, the flaws are apparent. There are no character development whatsoever, the tension might overstayed its welcome, and all of the actors delivered a subpar performance.Overall, this movie provided good entertainment and continues to break the boundaries of the usual horror movie tropes.",9,6,11,5 September 2016
The Secret Life of Pets," Unoriginal story, beautiful graphics, and tired tropes: a perfect children's movie.
","There was a toy that belonged to a human. They have a very special relationship, as they spent every waking minute together, except when the owner's not home. Things start to change when the human brought home a new toy. The older toy starts to feel replaced and jealous as the human spends more time with the new toy. The toys got into a quarrel and got themselves separated with the rest of the toys. Now, the toys must bond and form a plan in order to return home. Meanwhile, the other toys frantically searches the city for their friends. Will they be able to find them? Will the toys make it in time?What I just described to you is the plot of Toy Story.And this movie has more or less the same plot. Just replace the word 'toy' with 'pet'.I read somewhere that there was this thing called 'praise sandwich', where you first praise someone's work, criticize them to death, and then end the critic with another layer of praise. I'm gonna do the same thing, except I'm gonna call them 'critic sandwich'.The graphics in this movie were absolutely beautiful and radiant. There were some unexpected scenes, and some language that shouldn't be heard by children. Jenny Slate deserves another praise for the voice acting she's done, as she's excelled in Zootopia.However, with the tired tropes and generic soundtrack, this movie just fell flat. It was good entertainment, nothing great, nothing mind-blowing, nothing awesome, just there to kill the time.",5,2,6,24 August 2016
The Nice Guys," Astonishingly funny, sweet, and well-executed.
","An enforcer who always gets his job done pairs up with a lousy alcoholic detective to locate a government official's daughter. What seems to be a simple job turns out very convoluted as they accidentally discover something sinister is at large.With such a basic and tired premise, The Nice Guys managed to hit all the highs and the lows of a buddy cop movie. Both Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling handled all their given materials perfectly. Angourie Rice also did an excellent job portraying Ryan Gosling's character daughter who snoops around her dad's job. She didn't overtake the two main characters, but she also got a chance to shine. There are multiple laugh out loud moments and some decent action portrayed (and some nudity), and the movie managed to also score a nice emotional touch to the characters. There may have been some played out tropes and old movie tricks, but with clever dialogues and top-notch delivery, you wouldn't mind getting past through all of it and have some genuine, tear-inducing laughs.Definitely one of an excellent buddy cop movie to watch.",9,7,14,22 August 2016
