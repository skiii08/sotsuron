The Incredible Hulk," Finally a bit of meat and potato's to go with my green eggs and ham...
","I went into this completely blind. I wanted a pure 'experience' I saw ONE trailer prior to this screening and closed my eyes while humming. I had no idea if this was a second in the series or a re-make.I was pleasantly surprised at the (obvious)complete makeover of our big green friend, and this was a (P.R.)change for him no doubt... this delightful romp will bring him right into the 'good guy fold' so to speak, within the umbrella of the, 'Avengers' Franchise that is now an inevitability.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, Lots of time on character development, and the intricacies that make you really care for a plot and its characters. I thought the acting was very well done although I found Liv Tyler to be the 'Weak Link'. Not sure she 'sold' her part that well or maybe it was just typecasting for that 'Armageddon' girl. The CGI was top shelf. There were no seriously 'over done' moments of ,'awww Come on' uttered in the theater. In this packed theater there were many ovations for the cameo's and the ,'Bad guy gets it' scenes, and even for the thrilling last minute of the movie. So where was Samuel L. Jackson?Please enjoy this more Comic like and more faithful version of THE HULK!*** PARENTS*** Go see it! Please do not bring kids under 5 yrs old! it is very realistic and violent. Be a good parent.",8,235,386,9 June 2008
Hot Fuzz," Great Ride for adults only!!
","This was a very slow buildup. The attention to detail was lovingly done and it showed in the dialogue, editing, and so many other subtleties. The creative geniuouses of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg allow the movie to use time honored techniques of lulling the audience into a false sense of calm and great foreshadowing to bring it on in the second 'act' and they don't stop until the ride is over. The momentum lasts and lasts... This movie is NOT for Children. I saw the sneak preview last week and to families had brought 5year olds up to young teens. There is a great deal of vulgar language and horrific blood and guts events that will scar a childs mind for a long time to come. So please if your reading this, excersize good judgement and leave the kiddies at home! You as and adult will enjoy the ride that much more knowing you didn't give your child a 'headstart' into juvenile deliquency.",10,0,0,24 April 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Helloromances? Overly critical? perhaps....
","Well here I am with another difficult film to review. I went to the preview 7/8/08 in Hartford CT. The crowd that was there was enthusiastic, even though it was not a packed house. I have been trying to classify this movie.... I started out assuming it was a comic book action adventure, I then cam to realize that Del Toro intended this to be a comedy. Wait, now I think its an attempt at at a love story slap stick comedy. OK I have to give up on labeling it!I'm not sure what the intentions were. But I know I left there with the impression that I had just seen a complicated conglomeration of several different movie genres. It wanted to be a comic book action thriller, but spent too much time and tried too hard at being schmaltzy and comedic.Hellboy seemed to reach for every possible joke you could squeeze out of the, ' ... Believe it or not - he's the good guy...' tag line. I think we understood that much out of the first movie. Being beaten over the head with it was a bit painful.. I had the same type of experience in the Disney movie 'Enchanted', milking the jokes based upon the most unlikely juxtaposition possible for every possible guffaw! I thought Del Toro would have built on the solid action/comic style more in stead of building the love relationship as it were. The loss of Agent Myers was a detrement to the ensemble. Yes they set up the third movie with 2 main story lines that were laid down here, but the whole movie almost seemed like a primmer to the next installment. I am hoping the franchise gets back down to business in that one.Sadly the plot spent very little time with the Golden Army itself... it seemed like they had very big plans then ran out of money and thought up a faster cheaper ending. There was a whole host of nit picky things in this movie that bothered me too. First, young Hellboy did not seem to be in character and the prosthetics he wore were clumsy and poorly done. To me it was not very believable. The love relationship of Hellboy and Liz was not quite right either. It was like only one day passed since the ending of the last movie... and here we find our plucky new lovebirds already having rough times. It was not a plausible plot to me. I kept finding myself almost verbalizing my disbelief in how they handled the interactions between the two. Abraham's infatuation with the princess was in fact a more believable plot line. I also found much of the movie to be strangely ignorant of obvious answers. Remember when you know the killers in the closet of some B movie and you are trying to coach the star to help them avoid the obvious pitfall of opening the closet door where he will inevitably be attacked? Well there are quite a afew of these moment here. There were however some great one liners... but there just was not the same chemistry and pace that made the first installment a smashing success!Go see it... but consider going to the bargain matin√©e!",6,4,11,10 July 2008
Shutter Island," Time well spent???
","I went to see this film with my Girlfriend, we tried twice, but it was sold out previously. I was really expecting great things from Martin Scorsese with this effort, as well as stellar performance from DiCaprio! At least DiCaprio 'sold it' as best as anyone in Hollywood could have!It was slightly suspenseful and a little creepy but by the time they got the note out from under the missing woman's bed... I had the plot figured out to within spitting distance! :( the first thing to start rolling through my head was,' I see dead people'! well it's a bit of a new twist on a theme that worked out well in several movies in the 90's... but essentially it was no different. I thought The fore shadowing to be extremely heavy handed as if the director was talking down to the audience, but in the directors defense as I sat outside the theater, after the movie, waiting as the hoards of patrons passed by me as they were leaving, I heard too many people saying things like,' I didn't get the ending?' so perhaps Mr. Scorsese was attempting to allow a greater portion of the masses to 'get it' by putting the hints etc. more in our collective faces for us see. For me it was a waiting game to see all the directors cards on the table... I should have waited for the DVD.",6,2,6,3 March 2010
Enchanted," Juxtapositions and subliminal message work!
","I saw this in a preview on 11/08/07. I'm writing this review today because I really needed to digest what I saw that night. I will admit, I read more and a few reviews here today that are glowing with praise and in many of the cases it is justified. The overall good feeling and sweet taste that you are left with after watching this film is quite palatable, by design.I fear that the overall public has taken another clever marketing ploy, hook, line, and sinker! If you read even a few of the other reviews then you have had more than enough of a good thing and I will refrain from adding to the drooling... Instead I will tell you I laughed when Disney wanted me to laugh, cried when they wanted me to and watched their practically subliminal messages roll across the screen like waves of cotton candy, eagerly gobbled up by all who witnessed....OK, Movie starts in a fairy tail classic that Disney does so well, ( the CGI mapped and converted humans coupled with the classic animation was not very good) then we thrust a Juxtapostion of 2 of the most unlikely elements, with loads of potential for 'what ifs'' New York and a Naive cartoon fairytale character. This hes been done so many times before in Hollywood but never on this scale. After a while I was sitting thinking to myself,'Hmmm what else can we make these lovable innocent characters do in NY city that would illicit a good laugh...'? well the studio found most of them! Moving on to Children and adult relationships... Do we really think Disney is the most qualified party to be giving our children suggestions on how to deal with divorced/ing parents? I was very disturbed to realize that any child who is old enough and sees this film will be asking for his divorced/ing parents to get back together for Christmas..( Poor Santa and all those wish lists!) it clearly made 2 suggestions with it's plot;1). Parents don't really need to divorce, they can work it out with just a little help of some fairy tale smoke blown up their collective....(which kids will try to do..)2). Money can solve many of your problems in life or love...The above #2 statement killed me to write. I liked where the movie was going until Amy Adams ( who can sew up any dress she desires, fit for any Queen,from any fabric in the house overnight) Tells the little girl (Rachel Covey)that she needs a really great dress for the ball tonight, and this is where I suspect there was some board room drama at Disney, and the little girl advises Giselle that she has this Gold card for 'emergencies' and this is an 'emergency'! Well I suspect the writers had envisioned a moment of bonding where the two make a dress together by hand from some special fabric, but Disney saw an opportunity to whore this film out to pay for its budget but letting the naive princess to be go shopping for enough clothes to fill a wardrobe for a year! and in the end she shows up looking lovely as Amy Adams always does but paling in comparison to the dresses she had made herself! Product placement strikes again... and again... and again...What are we teaching our kids... Yes I can see the point that on one level the film can pass along the message that we need to take time to get to know someone before getting into a serious relationship, but I don't think that is one of the messages that kids will come away with.p.s. 'Dear Santa all I want for Christmas is a shiny Gold Card'.... p.p.s. The acting was OK, Wormtail is typecast as wormtail here.. and I found James Marsden to be the most believable and likable of all the cast.Go see it for your self... someone has to pay for all that product placement!",5,18,60,12 November 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," The kids will love it!.... adults, sorry enjoy the pretty colors!
","Let's Start off with saying I'm giving this movie a 7 out of ten for children out there who love a good time. As for the adults I'd have to go with a 5 or 6. On to the review... I sat in the center of my row listening to the crowd throughout this blockbuster movie and it was a crowd pleaser. perhaps forty percent of the crowd consisted of real 'fans', meaning people who either loved the comic books or the first movie and were hoping for more. At this advance screening there are always large quantities of opportunistic freebie lovers there that don't even know what they are seeing. The writers gave the audience what they wanted in many ways with lots of laughable one-liners and schmaltzy goo to make the average crowd clap and 'ahhh' at the right moments. but it was screaming, 'where is my plot' throughout the entire movie. It started with some suspense and raised eyebrows then meandered off into,'so what do we do next?' The acting was very average and as many of the other reviews will tell you, only Chris Evans as Johnny Storm acted and truly evolved during this film. The producers decided to leave the 'meat' of a story at home thus avoiding the chance that they may include any moments that are even vaguely mentally challenging to the viewer. So if your looking for your average 'great CGI, big budget, thrill ride' for the sake of the ride itself... Have a great time but if your IQ is over 100 and you like to be challenged by a writer and director, well you will need to wait for the next opportunity to come along. The sadist part about this movie is it seems like someone wrote a program to tell them what the movie needed in it to make it better and better and in the end they created a master of mediocrity instead.Maybe next time ... Props to Stan Lee... the Cameo was hilarious!",7,10,20,14 June 2007
The Dark Knight," Not to be see by children under the age of 14, because Batman is now real!
","There are good movies out there to watch and there are very good movies out there this year to watch... I have now seen two of the best movies made to date! This movie rocked in plain (slang) English! This is an ADULTS ONLY movie, make no mistake, and that is regrettable. This movie had so much realism that any child/teen under 14 should not be allowed to see it at all never mind with a parent! OK! With that out of the way.... on to the real deal...There is so much right in this movie that I can only fine the smallest of things to complain about or fix. I found all the performance to be excellent and in character. A few of my issues started in 'Begins' so they are perpetuated here. Sir Michael Cain, please loose the cockney accent! it never seems to fit into the aristocracy from which he has worked his whole life... Batman's guttural voice is a little forced sounding.... The length of the movie was excessive too. i found two parts towards the end where I noticed people taking the time to look at a watch or cell... that should not happen if the audience is fully engaged.On a deeper level... I was amazed to see the biggest change to the whole Batman franchise since it began, there was always the Dark city.... and the white light of batman in the dark gloom of the night. Now conversely in this incarnation, we have the bright white city (just like real life cities) and the dark at heart Batman....For this reason it is no longer made for children at all! it portrays all too real of life's events. that is the scary part, that is what keeps the adult minds on edge in this film. Batman can no longer be like a comic book hero... he is Real now! Go see this!",10,3,6,22 July 2008
Avatar," You must see this to believe it!
","I brought 2 boxes of Goobers to see Avatar... unfortunately for me I needed to have brought 4 boxes! Think the storyline of 'Furn Gully' all grown up and using the Tech of 'The Matrix' with the heart and Soul of the story line right out of 'Braveheart'! Enough said.This is the extraneous stuff you do not need to read to know that you need to go see this film. Unfortunately I need Ten lines of text! The acting was superb, The graphics unparalleled, the sound was Tres' Magnifique! I can not await the arrival of a heartwarming 'Mechwarrior' film that really needs to be made! the tech is here and in place lets get on with it people! :)Well done James... Well Done!
