Miracle," Great!!
",I really enjoyed this movie.  It was heartwarming and uplifting.  Kurt Russell did an outstanding job as always.  The rest of the cast did great jobs as well.  Whether you remember the 1980 games or you don't..you will love this movie! Go see it!!,10,0,0,7 February 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Highly entertaining!
","I absolutely loved this movie!!  Johnny Depp was incredible as Cpt. Jack Sparrow.  As with most roles..he makes it his own.  If you want a movie with action/adventure, laughs and a bit of romance..then you must see this movie. I can't wait to own it on dvd.",10,1,2,12 November 2003
Titanic," Great movie!
","I absolutely loved this movie.  It had everything a movie should have......drama, romance, action and even a bit of humour from time to time. James Cameron did and outstanding job!  Titanic is in my top five fave movies of all time!",10,2,4,4 February 2004
