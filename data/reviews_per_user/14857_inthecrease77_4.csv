Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Its all part of the story
","All Lucas wants is to tell a story...and its not done yet.I can watch this movie over and over again. Jar-jar does not bother me...at least he can be funny...Jake Lloyd (Anakin) SUCKS!!! NO talent  He doesn't act, he just reads lines...UGH!!!! That was the only part I disliked.",8,1,2,16 May 2002
American Beauty," Not Good
","I don't understand how so many could have like this movie. I don't usually act as a critic on movies, I like to watch them for the story and the entertainment value. But this movie didn't entertain, or tell a good story. American Beauty....is this really what Hollywood views life in 'normal America'?? They used every stero-type they could find and crammed it into one movie; a cheating spouse, rebellious teenagers, overbearing, homo-phobic father who is really gay himself, fighting parents, killing of some sort cause some one isn't happy. It was too predictable, I didn't like this movie one bit! Kevin Spacy as as actor was okay, I am not saying that the acting was bad, I just didn't like the story it told.",1,2,6,25 October 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Of course the movie can't included the entire book...Duh!
","A movie can never replace what we see when read the books. Our imagination will create what we want to see. Everyone's vision of what should be in the movie is different. Overall, I really liked, and enjoyed the movie! Now really, do you think the whole book can actually be filmed into the movie??? NO! But they put enough in to make it enjoyable! A fun movie to see. Ron was awesome!Don't go to it and watch it like a film critic would, because you will always find something wrong, with anything, if you look hard enough!
Heck, when I went, the audience, really enjoyed it! There was a big round of applause when it was over, cheers and everything! And the majority of the audience in attendance were adults!Awesome movie!10 out of 10Nit pickers never enjoy anything! ha ha!",10,0,0,23 November 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," This Movie was Awesome!!!!
","I can't think of all the right words to say how great the movie was done! The most anticipated movie in a long time, does not disappoint. I am not going to pick it apart or look for mistakes. It was a 2 and a half hour movie as it is, they can't fit everything from the book into the movie. But it was cut very well, for what wasn't included! The Casting was the best I have seen for a movie, EVER! Enjoyable, wonderful, great, fun, humorous, I loved it, every bit!!! WELL DONE!!!!! Worth seeing over and over and over again!!! I am not a critic, just a movie goer so I am honest, Paying the extra bucks at the theater is well worth it, even to see again! I am still in awe, WOW! Great JOB!!!!! I can't wait to own it!",10,0,0,21 November 2001
