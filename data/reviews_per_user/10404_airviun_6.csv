Requiem for a Dream," A good film about dreams of the four people that never came true
","This film has a poetic title and it attracted me so I wanted to see it. Besides one of my friends recommended me to see it and I'm glad I did. We have an old woman who's dream is to get on TV and become famous and she is obsessed with TV shows. The other three main characters of the story are more interesting... they are all young and restless but they are obsessed with drugs. It's the road that leads them nowhere. All of them are good people and they have their light side, but the end for each of them is tragic. We have a young couple who love each other and a friend of the main character. By the way some moments of this film are too long and unnecessary, some are even dirty. I'd say it's not a masterpiece but definitely a good film that makes audience think about their life and dreams.",7,0,1,9 January 2015
Erin Brockovich," Nice drama film based on the real story
","Julia Roberts plays a great role in this good film. I thought it would be a passable film but it's quite interesting and even intriguing. It is the story about a woman with three children and two divorces behind in her life and without a job and money. And in such situation she finds strength to climb up and finds job, money, gets respect and finds a man who falls in love with her. The plot is about a big corporation that poisonous chromium makes ill the villagers of small town. After investigation and the proof of such things that company finally pays many millions to that villagers as a compensation. A good film to enjoy in the evening with a cup of tea lying on the bed.",7,0,0,25 November 2014
The Devil Wears Prada," A film about fashion and intriguing relationship between a nice smart girl and her very strict chief
",This film stands out from the rest of typical films. It's about world of fashion and how difficult it is to really live a life in that sphere. The main character Andrea is a young and naive smart girl who is looking for a job and she is very diligent to complete every task of her boss. And her chief gives her so many tasks that while watching I understand who is the Devil here. Despite all the difficulties the main character stays sincere and true to herself. The film probably teaches us that there's always a choice and everything comes at a cost. While so many people envy those who wears fashion clothes and luxury things very few understand how difficult it is necessary to work to get those things. The ending is also beautiful and maybe the best moment of the film is when Andrea throws away her mobile phone when her chief called her and decides to leave her job and world of fashion to start a new life with a new job.,8,1,1,6 March 2018
American Beauty," A good movie, but probably a bit overrated
","Well the most beautiful thing about this film is it's name: so attractive and charming! The story is intriguing from the start when the main character tells us that he'll die in a year. And the finish of this film is also interesting filled with philosophical reflection about life and death. The story is rather ordinary about a man in his midlife crisis, his cheating wife and his passion for a teenage girl who is a friend of his daughter. It has some moments like seeing something unusual in ordinary things like plastic sac dancing on the wind and even a kiss between two men. Overall it's a nice film for watching when you need to relax and forget about your everyday problems, but there were better films in 1999. If you've never seen this film do yourself a favor and give it a try.",7,0,1,19 September 2014
Before Sunset," Enjoyful and pleasant romantic melodrama
","It's a film about two people that once spend some time together and it was maybe one of the best days in their lives. Now 9 years later they meet again and have another wonderful date together. I liked the first film Before Sunrise for it's romantic story and this film while also great and similar to that one it is not so outstanding.We can know what both of the main characters Jesse and Celine went through during this long 9 years and it's revealed that they didn't meet in Vienna 6 months later as they agreed. Most of the film Jesse and Celine talk with each other about many things and they walk by the streets of Paris. 9 years later they still like each other and there is a sparkle between them. The ending is open and unclear, but it has its charm. Overall it's a nice romantic melodrama in some way unique and everybody can recall his or her own first love and try to get in touch after all those years.",8,0,0,29 July 2016
High Fidelity," A film about music and romance
","I'm music lover myself and like listen to the music and I do it quite often at home or when I'm on the road, sometimes even at work. So the main character in this movie owns a record store with thousands of vinyl records. Like in music charts he makes his own top 5 chart of girls with whom he ended relationship and tells a story after story about them. Unfortunately this film doesn't have deep meaning and isn't thought provoking. There is also some vulgar gestures by one of the main characters friends and it isn't funny. At the same time it also have some bright moments it's about a singer with whom main character makes best dating of his life. Summarazing I can tell that it's passable at best and forgettable at worst, but still this film has some uniqueness that makes it worth watching for some variety.",5,0,1,3 January 2015
