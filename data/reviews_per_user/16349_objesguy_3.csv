Scarface," Pacino is great, but the rest of the film is overrated
","Oliver Stone has a habit of writing extremely controversial films that are either extremely well done (e.g. JFK) or extremely corny (e.g. Natural Born Killers). Scarface is one of those corny ones unfortunately, even though it seems hard to believe that this film could be mediocre considering it has one of the greatest directors ever at the helm (Brian De Palma), and one of the greatest actors of our generation gracing the main role (Al Pacino). Unfortunately, while Pacino's performance is one of the best (and maybe his most overacted)of his career, the film itself is filled with mediocre performances, a cheesy and linear storyline, and bland, one-dimensional characters that prevent this crime movie from being anything more than a popcorn action flick.Pacino does an amazing job throughout the film playing Tony Montana and truly stands out amongst all the mediocre acting and performances. While Steven Bauer does a decent job as his buddy Manny, Michelle Pfeiffer's character, Elvira, is atrocious. Not only is she a drugged up junkie that is the same character throughout the movie, but she doesn't say anything of significance throughout the movie other than cynical, sarcastic comebacks that make the audience think she is PMSing 24-7. Even her last line in the film is a corny and somewhat uninspired line that has the audience chuckling rather than sympathizing with her, which is just another example of Oliver Stone trying way too hard with his scripts. However, Al Pacino rescues all the mediocre performances with his emotional portrayal of Tony Montana. Throughout the movie, Pacino is passionate in his role, usually screaming everything at the top of his lungs or following anything he has to say with a curse word or two...or three. While at times Pacino does say some lines that have the audiences scratching their heads (which is not Pacino's fault but rather Oliver Stone's), Pacino's performance helps overcome those obscure lines and makes the audience yearn for more.The same can't be said of the story of Scarface however. Despite its great potential, the film' story falls flat on its face, lacking any real depth or any personality at all. Even though Stone and De Palma wanted to simplify the story and dialogue from the original 1932 classic (which was set in New York and about Al Capone), they simplified it too much and thus the story suffered because of it. With everything now simple and quite linear, making the story is easy to follow for the casual viewer; the film still lacks any punch other than the tremendous amount of violence. When the movie comes to a close, the audience feels deprived in a way, feeling as if the film had no purpose or any personality of its own. While De Palma and Stone did accomplish their goal of telling a simple story of an American gangster, they only did a mediocre job. For it is just that: a simply story of an American gangster and nothing else. That may have been fine back in 1932, but compared to other modern gangster films such as Godfather, Good Fellas and heck, even Pulp Fiction, there is nothing Scarface has to stand on its own two feet in comparison to those films.It's a shock to see that a wonderful and passionate actor such as Al Pacino have all his talents go to waste on such a mediocre film. While the movie itself isn't a total lost cause, it is just not a film that truly stands out on its own. Pacino's performance saves it from total doom, but without it, Scarface is nothing more than a cheesy story that could probably be used for a CBS Tuesday Night movie following CSI. However, while this all sounds negative, it is not a total waste and deserves to be seen at least once, just because of Pacino and the action. However, actually buying the mediocre film would be a challenge, especially when the only version on sale on DVD is an expensive two-disc Collector's set.",6,2,5,25 May 2005
The Village," The Village is Truly A Gem In the Rough
","In theaters everywhere, The Village, directed by M. Night Shyamalan was billed as a horror film. It was to be a tale of suspense and fright that was to be as intense and as riveting as his previous and rather popular semi-horror films The Sixth Sense and Signs. Yet, the movie is nothing like a work of horror, or his former films (except for the twist ending). In fact, it hardly has any elements of horror at all, which is unusual for a Shyamalan film. However, while Shyamalan deprives the audience of a horror flick, he also pulls a surprise from his seemingly never-ending bag of tricks and presents us with a story that deals with complex and engrossing issues as love, trust and courage all in a puritan-looking village. In addition though, the film is about no ordinary 'village' for the inhabitants are fearful superstitious colonials, who fear one thing in their lives: the creatures that inhabit the 'forbidden woods'. While this seems to set up the right formula for a typical horror film, Shyamalan refuses to follow the rules, and instead presents us with a movie that is far from the typical popcorn suspense flick that audience have gotten too accustomed to.In addition to the complex story of the 'isolated village', the acting is a key component of the film that keeps the audience engaged from beginning to end. While underrated actor Joaquin Phoenix gives another solid performance, the real star of the film is Bryce Dallas Howard, who gives a riveting and sensational inaugural performance as Phoenix's blind love interest, Ivy. Amazingly, the chemistry between the two is amazing, yet Ivy seems to be the one that stands out the most. The emotion that she is able to display through her face and body language is a true characteristic of her professionalism and also a good sign that she is a competent actor that is capable of more roles in the future.The Village is not a horror film by any standards, and that is mainly why critics everywhere have panned the film and given negative reviews. However, while it may not be a horror film, it is an unbelievable film nonetheless. In its basic essence, it is a movie that is more complex than his previous film Signs, and strikes to the heart much deeper than any of his previous three films ever did. Granted, it takes an open mind and a patient soul to get everything Shyamalan has to offer from this movie, which is something audiences aren't used to doing. However, in this day of popcorn horror and suspense films and boring linear dramas, this is a movie that definitely stands out from the crowd and is worth the price of admission in more ways than one.",10,0,1,19 May 2005
Sin City," Third One is much, much, much more than a Charm for Miller
","It took about three tries, but finally Frank Miller will receive the credit he deserves as one of America's finest comic book writers after an excellent translation of Sin City to the big screen. While the other two movies (Daredevil and Elektra) tanked mainly because the directors compromised Miller's material in order to satisfy dim audiences and producers, the translation of Sin City is seamless, and while Miller deserves all the credit in the world for his amazing story that is noir at its best, Robert Rodriguez should also receive a fair share as well, as a director that perhaps is up there with fellow director and friend Quentin Tarantino. Without a doubt, Sin City is a film that will shock audiences and punch them in the mouth, but for a true fan of the crime and pulp genre, this is a film that is heaven on a silver platter.Of course, the most glaring positive of Sin City is definitely the cinematography, which should win an award at the Oscars if the Oscar guild knows any better. The fantastic mix of Black and White and color is amazing on the eye, and adds to the seedy tone of the movie, making the movie less of a big screen film, and more of a moving comic book. In addition, Rodriguez's idea of having the movie's backgrounds being completely computer-generated was ingenious, and without a doubt more of a technological breakthrough than the film that tried this method before, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Thanks to Rodriguez's idea of computer-generated background, everything from strip clubs to highways to even barns match the graphic novel exactly and give the film an even grittier feel that not even the best independent pulp film out there could give.Computer graphic can't make a movie though, and it is quite obvious from such stinkers as AI and Twister, where all the amazing special effects are only frosting on a bad cake. Yet Sin City amazingly exceeds even greater in other areas, such as acting where mesmerizing performances are given from nearly all the actors, adding onto the already fascinating story. The most breakthrough performance of the bunch is from Mickey Rourke, an 80's actor of previous fame from the also controversial film 9 1/2 Weeks. Rourke's performance as Marv is not only the best of the film, it is probably the best of his career and the best job of narrating in a film in a long time (it probably stands up there with Morgan Freeman's narrating in Shawshank Redemption even). In addition, while Marv is the tough guy that stands the most in the film, famous tough guys such as Bruce Willis, Benicio Del Toro, and Michael Madsen also give commendable performances that stand out and give extra balls to a movie that has more than enough to begin with. Clive Owen also does a decent job in the movie, but doesn't compare to the tough guys such as Willis and Rourke, making the 2nd part of the film, The Big Fat Kill, a bit tough to watch. This miscast though is only a minor problem though, for the other male actors make up for the slack, and the female tough-girl performances from Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy and Alexis Biedel surpass it by miles, making people forget all about Owen's slight miscast. Surprisingly, Biedel's performance is pretty much the most surprising of the film, for she does an incredible job of making the transition from her geeky and boring show, Gilmore Girls into an incredible movie like this and playing her role perfectly. She is definitely an actress that deserves much better roles in much more mature movies than the 'Teen' dramas such as her newest film, 'Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants'.Sin City is a masterpiece, no bones about it. It's a film that will get a lot of attention from angry Christian mothers about it's violence, gore and sexuality but the bottom line is, this movie is not meant to be made for children. Just like Frank Miller's comic, Sin City, wasn't made for children either. It is testament to pulp lovers everywhere, people who had fond memories of the hard-hitting in your face action from books such as 'I, The Jury' by Mickey Spillane and 'The Maltese Falcon' by Dashiell Hammett. However, the film is not limited to that, for it is a film that is hardcore enough for pulp geeks everywhere and mainstream enough for the casual, adult fan. Fans of cinema will adore it, bible bashes will be disgusted, but it is still an incredible film that deserves to be seen by film lovers everywhere, because it is definitely a film that lives up to the hype and goes much, much beyond.Bottom Line: Best Crime Movie ever, if you have a pulse see it.",10,4,8,2 July 2005
