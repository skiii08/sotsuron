The Blair Witch Project," blair yawn project.
",i read some of the comments made about the blair witch and im sorry but i just dont get it!  I personaly thought that it was the least scary film i have ever watched!  I do appear to be the only one who thinks this so it probably is just me.I just wanted to smack that silly girl every time she opened up her enormous mouth and screamed.ok the acting seemed very genuine and they obviously scared themselves silly making it but I kept waiting for something to happen and all of a sudden...................it was overIt bored me senseless and I consider it an insult to my backside which was forced to grow carbuncles through this terrible non film.sorry,Null,12,22,23 June 2001
