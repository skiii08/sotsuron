The Ring," Outstanding
","I have read many, many dismal reviews over this film.  I personally think it was a break through in cinematic horror.  Long have we waited for a movie to terrify us while leaving us scratching our heads.  Not since 'The Sixth Sense' have I been so inspired by a horror movie.  The directing is pitch perfect.  Gore Verbinski did an outstanding job capturing shots that will stick in my mind for many years.  The acting was as well great.  You don't go into a horror film expecting good acting.  Sometimes, the acting is completely absent all together.  In this film, it was well above average. Bottom line:  not just a great horror movie, great movie.  Two thumbs way up!",Null,1,1,21 January 2004
