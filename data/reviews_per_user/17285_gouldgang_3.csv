Sucker Punch," Umm so good
","I really feel the reason this movie gets bad reviews is partly because of eh hem, men not being in love with women being the main badasses in a video game type movie. The cinematography the set design the costumes all so incredible. Cult classic so cool",9,5,6,4 September 2019
Dawn of the Dead," Entertaining but not overly great
",Movie started out good but progressively the characters just started to get more and more stupid for no reason and it made me kind of lose interest. Especially the last half hour or so I was just kind of like... what? Did everyone lose the common sense they had throughout the movie. Regardless I love zombie/apocalypse movies and this one was a better one with a good cast.,6,1,1,3 June 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Literally one of the coolest movies I've ever seen
",I never watched the mad max movies from the 80's but I recently saw a video essay on YouTube about this one and decided to give it a watch. It exceeded my expectations in so many ways. The use of practical effects were amazing. It was like car pirates on the open desert. That paired with awesome characters including the bad ass old ladies. Just so cool and weird and awesome. Loved it.,9,2,4,17 August 2019
