Vertigo," One of the master's best.
","Hitchcock has made some flashier films (The Birds, Psycho) and some more technically proficient films (Notorious, Rear Window), but in many ways, Vertigo is one of his absolute best.*Possible spoilers*Jimmy Stewart turns in a performance that at first glance looks like one of his standard Everyman Hero roles of the day.  However, Scotty Ferguson is anything but that - he's a man who becomes consumed by love, lust and obsession.  He finds himself drawn to Madeleine (Kim Novak), only to lose her just as he's falling in love with her.  The only thing to draw him out of his depression is Judy (Novak again), a lookalike for Madeleine. Scotty proceeds to make her over into his dead love in a creepy descent into madness where reality and fantasy no longer have any distinction for him.'Vertigo' is a film that holds up quite well after 44 years.  Yes, the pacing is a little slow, especially in the first half of the film.  But that's a deliberate choice.  Hitchcock was clearly capable of ramping up the action in other films; 'Vertigo' doesn't need that.  Scotty's mental state is best shown as a slow spiral, and it is even more disturbing on repeated viewings. This film has been described by other comments as 'dreamlike'.  I'd agree with that.  Bernard Herrmann's excellently haunting score; a script that is light on dialogue and heavy on imagery; and Stewart's rock-solid performance give 'Vertigo' a depth to the suspense.  It's a nightmare and a fantasy at the same time.  'Vertigo' is a classic of American cinema.  Even after four decades, it still has something to say about the nature of love and obsession.  And it's brought to you by the master of suspense.  Nearly flawless. 10/10.",10,4,5,4 December 2002
The Ring," Brilliantly scary.
","If you watch the tape, seven days later, you die.  That's the tagline for one of the creepiest, most effective horror thrillers to hit the screens in years.'The Ring' is a remake of a Japanese film and novel, ably directed this time around by Gore Verbinski (best known for 'The Mexican').  It stars Naomi Watts as Rachel Keller, a journalist whose niece dies under mysterious circumstances exactly one week after having watched that cursed tape.  After tracking down a copy of the tape and seeing for herself what's there, Rachel finds herself drawn into a maze of mystery and intrigue mixed with the paranormal, working against the clock.  If the stories are true - she only has seven days to unlock the secrets of the tape.The key to this film lies in the visuals.  Obviously, in using a VHS tape to show this ghostly curse, it's important to have a strange, creepy look to the tape - it holds all the visual clues for the story to follow, as well as setting up the theme and mood for the entire picture.  Everything on the tape is grainy, black-and-white, and silent.  There is a definite foreboding to the whole thing, even though, as one character says, it looks like an art-school project.  Visuals are also important in the rest of the filming - most of the action takes place in gloomy, dark, and remote locales.  It's the Seattle area, so it's almost always raining.  Most interiors are gray and stark.  A rundown cabin in the woods.  A lighthouse and farm on a cold, barren island.  From the initial scenes, which are more vibrant and colorful, to the end sequences, things in Rachel's life are veering her closer to the secrets in the tape and the terrible answers she's looking to find.  Visually, the film grows darker and grimmer as the seventh day approaches. 
Watts handles this with a mixture of tension and unavoidable curiosity as Rachel's psyche is assaulted by tragedy and fear.  A lesser actress might fall into the usual scream queen traps - all stumbling and screaming - but Watts is better than that.  She shows fear, yes, but also resolve and a good sense of intelligence even as she draws closer to the end.  This is certainly her movie - she's the focus around which everything unfurls, and she holds her end together quite well.  'The Ring' is a ghost story, and a very tightly-plotted one at that. Everything in the tape is a clue to the mystery, and as it unfolds, more and more layers are evident.  The film does its audience the credit of not completely spelling out each and every detail, or walking through every step of the plot.  It reveals enough to bring gasps and shivers and even scares when it has to, and never resorts to manipulating the facts and motivations to achieve a cheap surprise.  There are twists, but there are seeds for those twists that fester in the background until they're needed - providing great chills along the way.This is a well-designed, well-executed thriller that has scares to spare, and a chilling backstory that will leave the audience in shivers even after the film is over.  Top-notch psychological horror here.",9,0,0,21 October 2002
Full Metal Jacket," Anything but Hollywood...
","In 'Full Metal Jacket', Stanley Kubrick's take on the Vietnam War, no easy answers are given.  This isn't a simple tale of men in war - it's a tale of how men become warriors, how they detach themselves from humanity and reality in order to deal with the worst horrors they'll ever see, and how some of them can't make it through that.Powerfully acted by a group of mostly no-names at the time (though some have gone on to bigger and better things, like Vincent D'Onofrio, Matthew Modine, and R. Lee Ermey), the film starts off in boot camp.  There, Drill Sergeant Hartmann (played with great venom and bluster by Ermey) proceeds to dehumanize the recruits and turn them into the proud, killing-machine Marines they need to be.  Ermey has all the best lines in the film - most of them unprintable here (check out the quote section) - as he continually berates and belittles the new Marines, all the while shaping their mentalities for the war they'll be shipped off to.  Some don't fare as well as others, as Private Pyle (D'Onofrio) has a memorable meltdown as the film bridges from basic training to Vietnam itself.There, Private Joker (Modine), working as a military journalist, finds himself the center of several nasty and brutal scrapes shortly after the Tet Offensive.  The scenes here aren't Hollywood polish - they're gritty, confusing, and seemingly random - just like real war.  The climax of the film culminates in a bombed out shell of a city, where the squad has to deal with the threat of a VC sniper and the uncertainty of a broken chain of command.Kubrick creates a harsh and realistic view of war here, one that wouldn't easily be matched on screen for several years. 'Saving Private Ryan' is a different kind of movie altogether.  'Blackhawk Down' is probably the closest, and owes a lot of its battle-scene staging to this film.  Private Joker's continual John Wayne impressions send a clear signal that this is not your standard John Wayne-esque war movie, with clear heroes and clean victories.  Vietnam was a messier war, and the single goal of most men sent there was simple:  Get out alive.'Full Metal Jacket' is a very powerful war movie, and probably has a good argument towards being the best Vietnam film ever made.",9,0,0,30 March 2003
Glory," The best Civil War movie, period.
","'Glory' is, without a doubt, the best film ever made about the Civil War. Granted, it has its issues with historical accuracy and does highlight patterns and events within the war that weren't as important as the uninformed viewer might think.  Other comments on this movie have pointed out, quite correctly, that the Civil War was not wholly fought over slavery, that the makeup of the 54th was more upper-class and educated than runaway slaves, and other minor issues that separate 'Glory' from something like Ken Burns' documentary work.Quite frankly, these errors are irrelevant to creating a great, sweeping epic of a film such as 'Glory'.  The ideals here are not in reproducing historical fact; they are in creating an image of an all-black regiment serving in a war that is now more noted for its social impact than its economic roots.  This is the story of the black man's role in the Civil War - a story that shows men of all colors battling for their ideals, showing the same courage, bonding under the same stress, and giving their lives the same way.  This is a film that is now shown regularly in history classes and rightly so; very few films have captured the sense of war so brilliantly. 'Saving Private Ryan' does such for World War II; 'Glory' is the picture of record for the Civil War.It's filmed beautifully, as cinematographer Freddie Francis took home a number of awards, including the Oscar, for his portrayals of the various battles.  Best of all is the final struggle at Fort Wagner, the bittersweet pinnacle of the 54th and a tearjerking dramatic display no matter how many times you've seen it.  It's simply a wonderful scene mixing drama, confusion, bravery and violence and offers an empathic look into the experiences of these soldiers.The acting all around is superb, as Denzel Washington turns in an intense performance that netted him a Supporting Actor Oscar.  He's hardened and defiant; best shown in the whipping scene where he never flinches - only a tear runs down his cheek, no matter how many ugly scars line his body.  A powerful performance.  All the actors seem to consider this film, and their roles in it, of utmost importance; as if the story they are telling desperately -needs- to be heard.  Morgan Freeman and Andre Braugher as other soldiers, and Matthew Broderick as Shaw don't hold anything back. 
'Glory' is an emotionally-charged film that never sugarcoats the harsh realities of war, but also highlights the bravery and fortitude of the men that fought it.  Historical errors and dramatic compromises aside, this is a wonderful film that illustrates the Civil War and its devastation unlike any film before it.",9,0,0,20 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Worth the wait.
","The first thing to understand about the prequel trilogy to Star Wars is that it can never, and will never, be appropriately judged by this generation. These films can simply never live up to the impossible expectations set by the fans of the beloved original Star Wars films, so they will always be viewed as disappointments by those who remember staring up in awe at the screen the first time they saw Darth Vader.That said, Episode II: Attack of the Clones is a worthy addition to the Star Wars pantheon.  It takes place ten years after Episode I, during a period of unrest in the Galactic Senate.  A civil war has broken out, with many worlds threatening to leave the Senate, and an important vote is taking place on Coruscant.  Amidala (Natalie Portman), no longer the Queen of Naboo but its Senator, is threatened with assassination as she travels to make this vote, so she is assigned protectors:  Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor) and the now-grown Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen).After an attempt on her life, Amidala and Anakin leave Coruscant while Obi-Wan investigates a mysterious bounty hunter called Jango Fett (Temeura Morrison), who may be behind the assassination attempt.  All of this culminates in journeys to several planets, the introduction of a clone army, and a climactic battle between Jedi, battle droids, and the prototype Stormtrooper army.  And Yoda whips out the Jedi mastery like never before.As a technical piece, the folks at ILM have outdone themselves yet again. While Episode I contained just a few full-fledged CGI characters (Jar-Jar Binks being the most prominent), Episode II has dozens of major CGI figures and even more widespread battle sequences involving computer-generated enemies.  Yoda, for example, is completely CG throughout this film, and it's barely distinguishable from the puppet version used in earlier Star Wars movies.  His fight scene with a rogue Jedi near the end of the film - the audience favorite and a tour de force action scene - was painstakingly constructed by computer animators and is an incredible achievement.The eye has a lot to see here, as the city-planet of Coruscant is flooded with buildings, lights, ships and vehicles.  It would take several viewings to see everything included on-screen.  The clone planet and its denizens are excellently designed, as well.  While the first film seemed a little too clinical with its CG, this one seems to have incorporated the animation a bit more fluidly; you don't notice it as much as you do during Episode I, which is a sign that ILM is improving at its task.On the human actor side, the film benefits greatly from Lucas adding a helping hand on the script in the form of Jonathan Hales.  The dialogue is still mostly corny and chintzy, and often delivered woodenly, but this isn't Shakespeare we're talking about here.  This is high action space opera, where character motivations tend to be cut and dried and emotive acting would detract from the picture as a whole.  We all know this is about spectacle and drama rather than technique.That said, Ewan MacGregor (essentially nonexistent in Episode I), gets a lot more to do here, off on his own missions chasing down Jango Fett and the clones.  The romantic scenes between Christiansen and Portman get a bad rap from most reviewers; I disagree.  The two have a stilted chemistry that may seem wooden and inflexible (even immature) to most; but that's the point. One is already a career politician at age eighteen, the other is a Jedi Knight who is taught to rein in his emotions.  Both are dealing with more than just love and romance, and neither is very good at managing those conflicts.Christiansen is thrust into an impossible role here - nobody on earth could play Anakin/Darth Vader to the levels that most fans will expect.  Even so, he handles the role as well as he could, balancing a young man's own confusions with the anger and power that Anakin can barely control.  You can see the seeds for the creation of Vader, especially during a brutal sequence where he gives into his anger on a tribe of Tusken Raiders.  Christiansen has brooding down pat, which is essential to the core of a man who is destined to be the universe's greatest scourge.  So he isn't in touch with his emotions very well.  Can you blame him?All in all, the film is a rollicking adventure that gives action early and often.  The plot is still necessarily muddled with politics (although nothing as thick as the Trade Federation),and too many characters communicate using holograms - the modern equivalent would have everyone talking on the phone. The drama also falls short by necessity - you have a hard time rooting for the good guys when you know the destiny of almost everyone involved. Anakin will turn, the Senate will dissolve, the Empire will rise.  It's hard to build a standard dramatic curve with those restrictions. There are plot conveniences and some simplistic twists, but there are also little tidbits in there for the die-hard fans (Beru and Owen Lars, Bail Organa, the relationship between Boba Fett and the stormtroopers).It's a film that can be set next to the originals without much shame, and one that will probably look better once the next installment is released (much the same way that Episode I looks a little bit better now).  No Empire Strikes Back, but better than Return of the Jedi.",8,0,0,10 June 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Tons of fun.
","It's refreshing to see a film where the principals involved seem to be enjoying themselves immensely.  'Ocean's Eleven' is just such a film.  Rumor is that George Clooney got the star-studded cast to waive their usually high fees as a favor to him.  As a result, he ended up with a massively talented group of actors working their way through a remake of an old Rat Pack flick, with acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh at the helm.  What else do you need?Recently paroled con Danny Ocean (Clooney) assembles a crew of eleven con-artists and thieves to pull off the heist of a lifetime:  Robbing over $150 million from the vault of three Las Vegas casinos.  Without giving anything away, the caper itself is imaginative and completely unrealistic - which is why it's fun to watch play out.  Refreshingly, the mark of the con, casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) is no dummy.  He's smart, clever and careful, and that plays into the twists and turns of the heist.The best part is in watching Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner and the rest diving headfirst into their roles.  They have parts that are built on style and attitude, but rarely ham it up.  They have natural chemistry (especially between Pitt and Clooney - their rapport is great).  The dialogue crackles crisp and stylish.  These thieves aren't vulgar or violent - they're smooth and refined and almost never lose control.  'Ocean's Eleven' is a display of cool, a production of style, and a very enjoyable heist flick to boot.  Well worth your time, it does what many movies fail to do but seems so simple:  It entertains.",8,0,0,15 December 2002
The Transporter," Action for action's sake
","Let's be honest here.  The appeal of The Transporter is not in a gripping, tightly-plotted script that speaks to the intricacies of human nature.  The appeal of The Transporter is in the action.  The appeal is the highly-choreographed, Hong Kong-inspired, thrill-a-minute martial arts and stunts that make movies like this great fun.Directed by Hong Kong veteran Corey Yuen (Jet Li's Fong Sai Yuk movies) and coscripted by French action master Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita, Leon, The Fifth Element), The Transporter is the story of Frank (Jason Statham), an ex-military man who now earns a lucrative living in France as a transporter; a man who drives criminals and delivers packages, no questions asked.  Frank has three rules:  Number one, never change the deal.  Number two, no names. And number three, never open the package.Well it wouldn't be much of a movie if Frank didn't break the rules - and it's rule number three that proves his downfall, as he opens the package in his trunk only to find the lovely Lai (Shu Qi).  This starts a chain of action sequences that lead to a very cloudy and obscure plot which serves mostly to offer up more bad guys for Statham to beat the living snot out of.And beat them up he does. The action sequences are the saving grace here, with boundless energy (and an endless supply of goons) and inventive setpieces.  The movie starts with a high-energy chase scene down alleyways, up stairs, and every which way but the right way on one-way avenues. Another top-notch scene involves an outnumbered Statham fighting off a barrage of mooks while all of them have to deal with overturned barrels of oil - there's more slipping and sliding than there is punching and kicking there.  It all adds up to a lot of fun.There's no depth and mystery involved in a picture like The Transporter.  It is what it is, and it aims to please.  For pure entertainment (and a few double-take moments), it's well worth the time spent.",7,0,0,14 October 2002
Moulin Rouge!," This film will simply dazzle you.
","Forget everything you thought you knew about the Hollywood musical.  Forget anyone who ever said that the musical was dead; that it was a relic of the past, and that reviving it was a recipe for disaster. 
Baz Luhrmann never listens to people like that anyway, and Moulin Rouge - his latest in a career seemingly based on flying in the face of conventional wisdom - is a stunning masterpiece of visual and musical achievement, and richly deserved all the accolades it received as one of the best films of 2001.Set in 1900, Moulin Rouge tells the story of Christian (Ewan MacGregor), a struggling writer who falls in with a group of Bohemian actors and tries to sell a show to the owner of the famed Paris nightclub Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent).  To get his pitch heard, Christian approaches the most desired courtesan in the club, Satine (Nicole Kidman), and while he finds himself smitten by the girl's obvious charms, is competing for her heart with the Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), whom Zidler is wooing as an investor in the Moulin Rouge.Basically, it's a formula plot straight from the grand musicals of the fifties - girl must choose between true love and a wealthy suitor - and one of the many brilliant points of the film is that this very plot is also the subject of Christian's production: the very aptly named Spectacular Spectacular!  From the first time Christian sets foot in the Rouge, the film takes the viewer in every direction imaginable, never content with just a straightforward telling of the love story.  Everything is wrapped in dramatics and theatrics, song and dance, costumes and flair - and it's both familiar and original.  The songs are inspired in choice and arrangement, as most of them are covers of love song standards (Elton John's 'Your Song') or very unusual choices ('Smells Like Teen Spirit,' or 'Lady Marmalade'), mixed in with some Beatles classics and Whitney Houston ballads.  But none of these are quite the same once rendered by the impeccable voice talents of Broadbent, Roxburgh, MacGregor and Kidman.  Every anguished confession of love is sung through one of these timeless lyrics (or the occasional original song, such as 'Come What May'), and woven into the story seamlessly, as if they were written directly for the screen.  Nothing seems out of place, no matter how different it might be at first glance.  Even 'Roxanne,' by the Police, is reinvented as a tango, and is one of the more haunting set pieces as it's interspersed with Christian's budding jealousy towards the Duke. 
MacGregor and Kidman, not noted for their singing voices in the past, acquit themselves very well here, showing off good ranges and talents combined with their well-earned acting chops.  This is no throwaway story in their hands; you yearn for Satine as much as Christian does, and you weep when she weeps, and you ache when they both ache.  The Bohemian tenets of Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love are all in effect here, as Luhrmann takes his vision and paints the canvas of the screen in a beautiful array of visuals that most directors would never even imagine, let alone try.  Perfect costuming, a frenetic pace, and a game cast willing to try anything for the show provide two hours of blisteringly good entertainment.  By the way, don't be ashamed if this film makes you laugh, makes you dance, makes you sing, and makes you cry.  It's worked quite hard to make you do all of those things.  Brilliant film-making.  Don't miss this one.",10,1,2,10 June 2002
8 Mile," The psyche of a star.
","Eminem could have taken an easy road.  He could have costarred in the latest Steven Seagal flick, or done a cameo for the Farrelly Brothers' next movie. He could have cashed in on anything he wanted to with his first movie, but he chose something a little more challenging than that.'8 Mile', named for the road that is the northern border between Detroit and the suburbs, is loosely autobiographical, shaped around the events of an up-and-coming rapper named Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith Jr. (Eminem).  Rabbit has to balance working for a living at Detroit Stamping with his dreams of a rap career and an escape from the trailer park he calls home with his mother (Kim Basinger) and little sister Lilly.  At night, he cruises the city in his beat-up car with his friends, the 313 crew (named for Detroit's area code).  One of the 313 is Future (Mekhi Phifer), who organizes rap 'battles' downtown, where young MC's square off against each other with stylized insults and rhymes - winner gets all the respect.The film starts with Rabbit psyching himself up for one of these battles, showing none of the anger and cockiness that the real-life Eminem is so known for.  Rabbit is unsure of himself, knowing he has talent but intimidated by the forceful personalities that surround him and not quite ready to burst out of his shell and let the world know who he is.  Even standing on stage, mic in hand and silent, hearing the boos and calls of 'Choke!', you can see that Eminem the actor has something here, a sense of character that isn't just him playing himself.  It's an intensity and a force of personality that is waiting for an outlet and he keeps it smoldering throughout the movie.Director Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential) keeps the film flowing as sidebars and challenges arise that twist Rabbit in the wind.  His mother's boyfriend is a complete waste and not much older than he is.  Money is always an issue.  An opportunity for free studio time arises, but with strings attached.  A muse of sorts (Brittany Murphy, elegantly trashy here) wanders into his life at just the right time.  And finally, another rap battle against his rivals, in the same place he choked before.  By the time he takes the mic again, the audience has seen his long, hard climb to this point.  Opportunity is there, all he has to do is seize it.And seize it he does - the final rap battle brings the house down. Eminem finally lets loose with the skills we all know he has into a series of cathartic rhymes, taking on all comers. The last rap, where he takes all the bad things people have said about him and uses them to build himself back up, is pure genius and pure adrenaline.  By the time all is said and done, Rabbit walks off into the distance on his own - with all the confidence he'll ever need.Hanson and screenwriter Scott Silver make some good choices here. Eminem's real-life controversial attitudes towards gays and violence is muted with Rabbit to the point where he befriends and sticks up for a gay coworker. The final scenes aren't the big payoffs - the record deals, the demos, the sold-out concerts - but instead are personal victories.  Phifer and Basinger do creditable jobs of building up and supporting Eminem's inexperience as an actor and help carry the film through.It's a worthy debut, and a movie to take seriously. '8 Mile' is gritty, honest, and rewarding.",8,0,0,19 November 2002
From Hell," A psychotropic thriller
","There are many things in media that have nearly insurmountable preconceptions that lead to generic truisms. One of these is 'comic books are pure fluff,' and another is 'no good movie is ever based on a comic book'. From Hell is a project that takes both of those truisms and tosses them completely out the window.  Based on an ambitious graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Eddie Campbell, From Hell (named for the signature on the Jack the Ripper letters written to the police), is one man's carefully researched theory into the eternal mystery surrounding the Whitechapel murders of 1888.   This is not a factual display of guilt or innocence, as many of the answers behind these crimes will never be known, but as theory mixed with fact, it creates with chilling detail the mood of lower-class London in the late nineteenth century, where life was cheap, bloody and oftentimes short.The Hughes brothers, noted for their stylish direction, do a very good job of creating the mood here, involving all the grunginess and hopelessness of the streets, and combining the more mystical elements of Moore's story into the crime tale.  Johnny Depp is Inspector Abberline - an opium-smoking criminal investigator that often follows up on hunches he receives during moments of hallucinatory revelation.The style of the film - dripping with violent murder of prostitutes in alleyways - leaves more to the imagination than it reveals, although the gore level is by no means light.  The vicious throat-slashes and bloody crime scenes are definitely grotesque, but most of the time we are shown the crime after the fact, letting the viewer decide how horrible the murder itself was.  All the performances are strong, fitting together into an ensemble piece, with Depp being as much a chameleon as ever as Abberline, and Robbie Coltrane equally strong as his colleague Godfrey.  Ian Holm, Heather Graham, and Ian Richardson also provide good supporting roles. 
For an historical perspective of the Jack the Ripper crimes, best to watch an A&E documentary.  But for a theoretical description of the crimes, and an artful depiction of a carefully constructed tale, definitely check out the very chilling, very calculated, and very good From Hell.",9,105,136,9 January 2002
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Stylish, wicked fun - with Cockneys
","At first glance, one might think that Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels - the debut film from the man later to be known as Mr. Madonna, Guy Ritchie - is little more than another in a long line of late-nineties Tarantino ripoffs.  And again, at first glance, you might be right.  There are the camera tricks, the hip sixties soundtrack filled out with James Brown soul classics, the slew of crimes gone wrong, and a collection of characters with goofy names like Hatchet Harry and Barry the Baptist.But that's the first glance, and as the old adage goes, first impressions can be deceiving.  What Ritchie has done is craft a film out of familiar subjects (a failed gambling risk, a harried deadline to pay off a debt, and a desperate gambit involving guns, drugs, and cash), and weave together a stylish, entertaining film.Overloaded with characters of dubious moralities, Lock Stock throws everything but the kitchen sink into the lives of four friends who have spent their lives skirting the edges of the law.  These four gather together $100,000 for Eddie, the card shark, to enter a high-stakes poker game.  Of course, the game is rigged, and he ends up owing half-a-million quid to Hatchet Harry - a man you pay, or face the consequences.  Lo and behold, an opportunity arises - the lads' neighbors are drug fences who knock over a marijuana dealer for cash and weed, and this could well answer all their prayers.  Of course, nothing quite works out the way anyone could expect.Due to everyone having thick British accents and making full use of the unique styles of Cockney slang (explained in a glossary on the DVD as a special feature), Lock Stock can sometimes be a difficult movie to follow, though once you get used to it, there are some gems of dialogue rolling through all the action.  Think Trainspotting with less drugs and more violence.The cast (mostly unknowns at the time), does a fine job of settling into the theme of the film - near-cartoonish posturing and constant games of king of the mountain populate almost every scene.  Sting pops up as Eddie's none-too-enchanted father, who redefines tough love, and soccer star Vinnie Jones is an effectively erudite brute as Big Chris, the 'collection agent' for Harry.  His departing line, 'It's been emotional,' is a classic.It's not original, not by any real stretch, and not terribly groundbreaking other than some of the unusual camera tricks Ritchie pulls off (my personal favorites being the poker scene and the 'get drunk after the big score' scene) - which are very much like music videos in style.  That said, there's nothing that keeps it from being a rollicking good time of a movie, something that's well worth watching again.  If only to figure out what those geezers are saying.",9,0,1,10 January 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A very faithful adaptation - perhaps too faithful.
","The Harry Potter books are only the single most popular children's stories in existence - most children under the age of thirteen (and a good chunk of adults as well) can recite the books verbatim. Drawing from fantasy literature and owing quite a debt to earlier writers such as Roald Dahl, J.K. Rowling made her stories about Harry the Wizard into a phenomenon. It's been a merchandising groundswell, a boon to children's literature, and a godsend to parents everywhere.  What could be better than having your child dive into a 300+ page book for hours on end?  Why, making those books into movies, of course.  No pressure.The trickiest thing about adapting a book to a film is striking the balance between what works on paper and what works on screen.  Time is a natural restriction: a book has as long as it needs to describe the setting and the events and can delve into as much detail as the author deems necessary.  The reader can always put the book down and start up again another time, after all.  A movie, on the other hand, is a one-sitting event. Because of this, it needs to be more concerned about not overwhelming the viewer.  When transferring a book to the screen, things are usually streamlined, details (and sometimes characters) are omitted, and the end result is usually a reinvention of the original story.'Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone' doesn't reinvent the book it's based on.  It copies it almost word for word to the screen.  Almost nothing is left out, virtually no event is ignored, and the result is a dense film that runs two-and-a-half hours and is virtually indistinguishable from the book. If you've read the book, you've seen the movie.  So the question is, was this the right decision?It's a matter of taste, and the backlash on cutting anything from the original story probably would have been marketing suicide, but it definitely affects the film in terms of pacing.  While one of the beauties of reading a story like Harry Potter lies in unraveling the details of this new and strange world over the course of the school year, watching the same thing is a much different experience.  In an effort to show you as much as possible about the world Harry now lives in, it walks a very tight line between marvel and overload.  If it weren't the most popular book in the world, a tighter film probably would have been made.That said, 'Sorceror's Stone' is still a beautiful film to watch.  The set design of Hogwart's School is breathtaking.  Every corner hides a little bit of magical (and computer-generated) trickery.  Most of the effects are seamlessly done, with a few minor exceptions (mostly involving wide-angles of flying broomsticks).  It's a bit overdone at times, with the swelling score by John Williams and the panning shots of the school and the main hall - but that's the point.  Hogwart's is a realm of magic and mystery, and is always presented as larger than life.Casting is critical to a budding franchise like this one, and in general, 'Sorceror's Stone' gets it right.  The kids, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) drive the entire story, so they are key.  All are good choices and seem up for the roles, but Radcliffe and Watson don't quite seem comfortable just yet.  Grint, for his part as the lovable loser Ron Weasley, nearly steals the show every time he's on screen - he's got just the right balance of whimsy and mischief mixed with his humble down-home origins.  For the adults, the best castings are Richard Harris as Dumbledore (just right in his wizened expertise, always with a sparkle in his eye that says he knows far more than anyone else does), Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid (the loyal lummox with a heart as big as he is), and best of all, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape (who utters every word, even the most benign, while oozing sinister menace.  He's delightful.).  Maggie Smith as Professor MacGonagall is also excellent, just as Maggie Smith always is.This is first in a series, and as such involves a huge amount of exposition and explanation.  The entire film is consumed with who Harry is, why he's important, what's going on with all these wizards, and opening doors that will be explored in later episodes.  This means characters are introduced that don't do much of anything - yet. (Ginny Weasley and Nearly-Headless Nick, to name two.)  This means that the plot surrounding the Sorceror's Stone is necessarily thin.  This also means, that if the film (and book before it) has done its job, you'll be back for more when the next ones arrive.  On that note, 'Sorceror's Stone' succeeds wonderfully in bringing to life this delightful story of the boy who was a wizard and the remarkable world that invites him in.",8,0,0,17 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better than the first.
","'Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone', being the first in a series, suffered from the problem of exposition: by having to explain the rules and denizens of an all-new world it left its own plots and thrills to be short-changed.  On its own, it just didn't pack enough punch.The second movie in the series, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', doesn't have that problem.  It can get rolling from the first frames right on through into the thrilling climax sequences, and benefits greatly from the familiarity.  We already know who the characters are, we've already seen most of Hogwart's School, and we have an idea of what to expect.  Director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves, adapting this book as closely and faithfully as they did the first one, don't let us down.  High adventure and high drama unfold on the screen.There are changes.  First and foremost are the physical changes in the young cast members, most notably in the boys.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron) and Tom Felton (Harry's nemesis Draco) all have grown like weeds and had their voices drop into that grainy in-between range that hits all teenaged boys.  For some, especially Felton, the growth spurts help their performances (Draco Malfoy is now a lot taller and even more sinister.  He's no longer a kid playing at being nasty - he just is.).  Emma Watson (Hermione) doesn't have as drastic a change, but she does seem more comfortable in her role.  Given a part that swings wildly from sedate to obnoxious, she has reined in her extremes far better than she did in 'Sorceror's Stone'.  Radcliffe is also more confident as Harry, though a little uneven in his reactions to his surroundings.  Still, as he's in almost every scene, he handles himself quite well.  Grint, the best comic actor of the three leads, gets a few chances to show his stuff here, but like Watson, is less a part of the story this time around - it's pretty much Harry's movie.Returning from the first film are the main adult roles, as well.  Alan Rickman (Snape) is as drily dark as ever; Maggie Smith (MacGonagall) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) return, but have precious little to do in this installment.  The late Richard Harris (Dumbledore) is given more depth and substance here - as he will be throughout the series - and is wonderful with his balance of whimsy and wisdom.  He'll be sorely missed, and terribly difficult to replace.New additions on the adult side include the arrogant and narcissitic Godefroy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh, delightfully hamming up every single scene), and Draco's father Lucius Malfoy, a malevolent force of darkness (Jason Isaacs, seeming to enjoy himself almost as much as Branagh).  The best thing you can say about the adults is that they all seem to be having a blast doing these pictures, in a way that proves acting is not a chore or a burden - but a ton of fun.The events in 'Chamber of Secrets' are darker and more dangerous than the first film, as Harry discovers deeper plots than before.  There are some scenes that probably aren't appropriate for the really young children in the audience, but most of the older kids have seen much worse in lesser pictures.  The event pieces are good thrills and well-executed:  best are the flying car hurtling towards Hogwart's; the spider encounter in the Dark Forest, and the penultimate battle with the serpentine basilisk inside the Chamber itself.  It's a fun ride, more focused on the plots and twists than the first film was, though still prone to drawing out the action in the same style as the book.  There's not much reason to mess with a good thing, but Columbus will probably take some hits for a lack of originality in his direction.  So what?  It's still a very enjoyable film, and should satisfy Harry Potter fans quite nicely.",9,0,0,19 November 2002
Donnie Darko," Original and intriguing
","This movie came highly recommended from friends, who almost universally praised it, and also almost universally had the same comment:'It's great, you'll love it - but I can't really explain it.'This wasn't to say that the movie held any deep dark secrets that would utterly spoil it (like Sixth Sense), or even to say that it was so muddled and confusing that it didn't make much sense.  No, this comment was made because Donnie Darko isn't a movie that lends itself easily to a one-line synopsis.  It's not a film that's easily classified or cataloged.  It's just not like anything else on the video shelves.  And for that alone, it's worth the rental.  Or heck, even the purchase.Written and directed by first-timer Richard Kelly and set in a small town in 1988, Donnie Darko is the tale of a disturbed teenager (Jake Gyllenhaal, in the title role), who has an epiphany of sorts when he sees an imaginary six-foot tall rabbit.  Already undergoing therapy, Donnie's troubled life takes a turn towards the bizarre as Frank the bunny leads him along a quest for meaning and faith, as well as venturing into the theories behind time travel.   Along the way, he finds a love interest in Gretchen Ross (Jena Malone), who becomes intertwined in his quest and has some of the same dark and poetic outlooks on life that he holds so dear.Not a simplistic film by any means, Donnie Darko challenges the viewer at every turn and never once underestimates their intelligence.  In fact, upon watching the deleted scenes on the DVD, most of the cuts were made either for time or because they explained the premise too clearly - Kelly states that he didn't want to do the thinking for his audience.  As a result, you are gifted with an intriguing story that unfolds in dozens of directions at once, each holding meaning and purpose - if you choose to look for it. This attention to detail is quite rewarding, as little tidbits that seem like throwaway lines and scenes build in importance and pay off at the end. 
The score is haunting and effective: The instrumental score by Michael Andrews is mixed with 80s classics from Echo and the Bunneymen and the Church that are more than just cool retro songs thrown into the mix. Lyrically and emotionally, they perfectly fit the scenes they're backing - they have purpose just like all the other details in the film.  The final montage of the film is set to a blend of these two musical sources - a cover version of Tears for Fears' 'Mad World' done by Andrews and vocalist Gary Jules.  It's brilliant and understated.  Quality acting work is turned in here by the two young leads and also boasts a strong supporting performance by Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mom.  Good visuals, a strong script, and a well-conceived and executed ideal bring Donnie Darko into the pantheon of indie classics from recent years.  Kelly is a filmmaker worth watching in the future, and Donnie Darko is definitely a film worth watching right now.",9,0,0,15 August 2002
