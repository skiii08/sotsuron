The Expendables 2," already wanting expendables 3!
",yeah this may not be the best movie of 2012 but damn it was a bloody good movie to watch with chuck Norris in it not only that but most of the 80s tough guys when i first saw the trailer i knew this would be better than the first and lets admit it the first one was just terrible but i can tell you that this one improves a lot with the action and story and when i came out of the cinema there was a big smile on my face cause it entertained me and now i cant wait for the 3rd.............all i have got left to say is go and see it and you will enjoy it and you will be wanting to expendables 3 just like the other die hard expendables fans,10,3,8,30 August 2012
