Blade Runner 2049," Almost there...
","I was surprised Ridley Scott wasn't going to direct 2049 but Villeneuve proved to be worthy of the task. The cast is spot on, the photography is excellent, the sound effects are chilling, the universe is splendid, it is almost there. It is hard to pinpoint an obvious flaw in the movie and that's why I still rated it 8 out of 10. But there's not enough of Jared Leto, the streets of Chinatown are not packed enough, the pod where K lives is too much inspired from the 5th Element, the pace of the movie is quite random and for a film that long you expect more tension, some lengthy western confrontations, well just a bit more. You want more inventions like in the original one where every single object on stage was a specific design. Villeneuve respected the sets of the original, very good, but maybe just a bit too much, he should have owned this new universe. And honestly the new Nexus have no extra features and they can even get trashed by a human bare handed? Tiny bits of frustration all consolidated by the obvious clues that a #3 is already in the making. You don't enjoy a movie as the ultimate one if you feel that the end of the story is in a sequel. And when one respects a movie enough to wait 35 years before the next sequel... it defeats the purpose to make the audience feel the next one is much closer than that.",8,5,10,10 October 2017
A Star Is Born," Alright movie, good performance from both actors, a bad end
","No need to repeat all the nice things that have been said by others: acting is very good, especially on Bradley Cooper's side, directing is fine, photography is ok, music is good.
I love drama, I don't go for cheesy etc... but honestly the movie has nowhere to go once Brad hangs himself and for once you want it to end on a high note. Just my opinion but this was a very vain ending to a solid movie.",7,0,0,12 October 2018
Dunkirk," Now that was dull!
","Looks to me like Mr Nolan's director career is on the same track as Mr Night's (shamaya, Shimalaya, whatever). Their first or second movies (Memento, superb) were by far their best and it's all downhill from there (Interstellar, yuk).Dunkirk kind of lets you down on all accounts. No attention paid to the anachronisms (modern buildings, container cranes... lol). No characters whatsoever, except as solid as usual Mark Rylance. The storyline would fill half a page on a notepad. Seeing each scene from three different perspectives at different times does not make the film any better, just the story shorter. No suspense, no action, no acting, no nothing.Photography is decent, but it's not Private Ryan or Band of brothers.Honestly don't bother, watch it on freeview in 2 years you'll be equally disappointed.",4,7,14,26 July 2017
Mother!," Disgusting, painful and totally unnecessary
","If you want to ruin a perfectly fine Sunday evening that is the right movie for it. The photography is already a pain to go through (5 shades of grey basically), but the movie pulls all the biblical / mystical / psychotic strings that are best left alone. I think that DA's director career is taking a nosedive, good movies like Pi and the Wrestler are not doing enough to mask the sick feelings created by Mother! and Requiem for a dream. I'm not even mentioning Noah which got a generous 3/10 from me.
Some people see brilliance where I can only see garbage, so perhaps I'm missing something, but I think I am better for it.",2,1,3,14 January 2019
Lucy," You should only watch a Besson movie if...
","if Jean Reno is in it (plus the 5th element). This is not causality but a rule of thumb, like eating oyster only in the 'R' months.Big Luc said he would only direct 10 movies, and really he should have stopped at 6 or 7...Leon was the last really good one, and the Fifth Element the last one worth your 10Â£ for the big screen.If you're hangover and the two fingers method doesn't work, run to HMV, get Lucy, that will work a treat.Honestly if Besson could only go back to the old days and focus on real characters in a twisted but normal life, there's a good chance his inspiration would come back and he would treat us with another Subway or Nikita. Good LUCk",4,2,7,13 July 2015
