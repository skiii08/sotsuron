Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good Special Effects, Good Acting, Childish Plot
","I enjoyed the obviously well done FX and some of the characters were well acted and the settings were cool.  However, the story was childish and predictable a lot of the time.  'Gee whiz Obywan, do you think I'll be able to use a light sabre one day like a neeto keen Jedi Knight like you' {say in ridiculously cute childish voice}.  This is not a true line from the movie, but it may as well have been.  Why don't we raise the story level and character development in the next one please Mr. Lucas, at least to a teenage level.  Adults do go to see these movies in the hope of seeing some character development and a story worthy of their money and not something that was created with the hidden agenda of developing characters that will make for good toys and figurines and Happy Meal box additions.",2,0,1,15 July 2001
Doctor Zhivago," Come On Now
","I will admit that this movie is a litle slow at times, and it is a little hard to follow, and that the characters could have used some more development.  But this is still a very good film.  As other commenters have noted the cinemaography is wonderful and it really feels like Russia in the early 1900's.  Some of the pivotal scenes are very moving when one ponders the significance of the scene in the lives of the characters.  Maybe you just have to be in a reflective mood wehn you see this film.  I give it at least an 8 out of 10.",7,0,1,10 November 2002
The Usual Suspects," Good, But Definitely Very Overrated By IMDB Voters
","There is no doubt that this is an entertaining movie with a very good and well-disguised plot twist at the end.  Apparently, voting IMDB users are so enthralled by the last 2 minutes of this film and the presentation of the plot twist, that this movie ranks 17th all-time and ahead of many classic films from the last 75 years.  The IMDB Top 250 is an interesting list to study.  Lots of great movies are in that list, and more than a few overrated and perplexing selections too.  And 'The Usual Suspects' certainly jumps out as one movie that gets more credit than it deserves, though it is a good movie.",8,4,8,21 February 2004
JFK," Entertaining But the Story/Script is Flawed
","JFK is entertaining and Costner and others do a fine job of acting. Oliver Stone did everything right here, except for the fact that the story and script are flawed. There have been countless conspiracy theories developed and presented about JFK's assassination over the last 40 years. A lot of these theories are interesting, but are not supported by facts or evidence. For instance, the theory that Lyndon Johnson invited Kennedy to Dallas so that he could have him killed and control the investigation and then assume power. This is an interesting idea, and seemed to gain some momentum due to the botched and covert autopsy of JFK. However, this theory is ludicrous. The theories put forth in this movie are not accurate or supportable by the facts either. The bottom line is that all of the evidence points to a lone gunman, and that lone gunman was Lee Harvey Oswald. His fingerprints were on the rifle found in the School Book Depository. The slugs removed from Kennedy and Connelly ballistically match the rifle found in the School Book Depository. The magic bullet theory is bogus. It has been proved that a single shot could have entered JFK through the base of his neck, exited, and then gone into Connelly's leg. This bullet did not have to take any magic turns or twists to do so, as the story in this movie suggests. Also, it has been proved that a high powered rifle bullet that enters a human head will cause the head/body to recoil towards the direction that the bullet came from. This was always my biggest hangup with the assassination. It appeared to me that the fatal head shot must have come from the front of JFK, as he recoiled backwards. This seemed to support the 2nd gunman on the grassy noll or in the storm sewer or wherever. Anyway, that is my 2 cents on the matter. This movie contains some good acting and scenery, but the story is just not accurate at all.",1,21,58,10 January 2005
The Last Samurai," Very Overrated, Does not belong anywhere near the Top 250 films!
","Being a movie buff, I have come to love the IMDb website. It is fascinating to review the careers of directors, actors, actresses and to find out about movies that you haven't seen that look interesting. The only bad thing I can say is that there is a strong tendency towards recent or new films being rated highly. This is inevitable as there is a disproportionate number of younger people using the internet who primarily watch only new movies. Even knowing this, it is still a little disgusting to see an average movie like 'Last Samurai' rated in the same company as some true classics and masterpieces from the last 100 years or so of film making. This movie is OK, but I was disappointed in many aspects of the film. I thought that a lot of the scenes that were supposed to be the emotional climaxes of the story were kind of ridiculous and almost laughable (I did laugh a few times when I wasn't supposed to be. Anyway, how can this movie be ranked up there with Hitchcock's classics such as vertigo, Rear Window, etc. and a whole laundry list of much better films? I just don't get it.",5,4,9,6 January 2005
The Birds," Tippi Hedren
","The Birds is no doubt a very good Hitchcock film that has stood the test of time pretty well.  Some of the Special Effects are a bit amateurish by modern standards, but get the point across well enough in my opinion.  I have to strongly disagree with many of the comments here regarding Tippi Hedren.  I think her performance was quite good, especially for a first major role.  She was just absolutely stunning to look at, especially in the opening scenes of the film in the Bird Shop.  The basic premise of her character (i.e. the outwardly cool and confident female beauty possessing a core of vulnerability) was not new or groundbreaking.  Grace Kelly made a brief and meteoric movie career playing this type of character, well before Tippi was discovered by Hitchcock.  But Tippi was a beautiful and classy woman who gave a fine and appropriate performance in my opinion.  Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette are great too.  I was not real impressed with Rod Taylor's performance, but his character was possibly stiff and measured intentionally, as opposed to being poorly played.  Great movie, a must see for all movie buffs and fans of classy old movie stars like Tippi Hedren.",10,0,0,13 May 2004
