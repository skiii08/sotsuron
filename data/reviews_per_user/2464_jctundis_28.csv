The Incredible Hulk," At last we can forget the Ang Lee debacle!
","Ahhh... at last I have a Hulk movie that I'll be happy (and able) to watch again.The new Incredible Hulk is, first and foremost, an action movie. It's not Iron Man (which is a phrase that you'll probably see again and again as more Marvel movies are released). I gave Hulk an 8, while Iron Man got a 10.Once again, Marvel has created a hybrid movie combining elements of the Ultimate Universe (most notably the origin), mainstream Marvel Universe and the classic TV show starring the late Bill Bixby (there are several nods to the show including the theme song and an appearance - and voice work - by Lou Ferrigno).How does the CGI stand up? Much better than the Lee film. The daylight scenes are very impressive - and there is a scene in a rainstorm that is absolutely brilliant! No lame gamma-irradiated poodles in this one, folks.What I'm really looking forward to now is the Blu-Ray release which will have all of the Edward Norton penned scenes (many of which constituted the original trailer) restored. The one thing that kept me from giving this movie a higher score was the feeling of 'pulling back' from dramatic scenes. Norton is brilliant as Banner (as he is in most movies) and the dramatic punch that he will bring to the full length release fills me with anticipation. This is hinted at in a few poignant scenes before the viewer is thrust back into the action - and what action it is, especially when Tim Roth hits the screen.I really hope Norton returns - a situation that is in doubt - and picks up with the villain that long time Hulk fans will recognize as being created during this film.After being disgusted by the 3rd installments of Spider-Man and X-Men, I am fully on board with these new Marvel Studios productions. Bring on Thor, Captain America and The Avengers! HULK SMASH!",8,4,7,21 June 2008
Star Trek," A for effort.
","Much like the first Star Trek movie, this one leaves a little to be desired. I guess the 'odd numbered curse' lives on! The film moves at a breakneck pace at first, and then slows down significantly with the boredom alleviated with the timely arrival of Scotty, played brilliantly and with fervor by Simon Pegg.Abrams made it clear that this was not a Star Trek film for Star Trek fans, and this shows most evidently in the characterization of Spock. I can't really explain without giving too much away, but from a writing standpoint... if this was to be a re-launch of all that made Star Trek great for a new generation of viewers then any future revelations about Spock or Vulcan philosophy in general have been rendered somewhat meaningless. Abrams tore away all the much discussed conflicts within the vaunted philosophy of logic, and with a bit of 'gleeful contempt' as well.The villain, Nero, is unmemorable -- as is the main plot. The only refreshing change, for good or bad, is that Starfleet makes no effort to fix things! But, of course, since Abrams and company have incorporated a much hackneyed plot device to create a 'new re-boot reality' for Star Trek, they couldn't fix it now, could they? A quick assessment of the cast is as follows: Chris Pine plays an excellent Kirk. He's sexy, reckless and arrogant, but his presence is one of command.Zachary Quinto should have been great as Spock, but his portrayal is too emotional at this early stage and it's very hard to accept him in this role. One particular relationship is also hard to believe.Eric Bana's Nero is a lackluster villain and will be forgotten.Although Bruce Greenwood is a bit too old for the role, he makes an adequate Christopher Pike.Karl Urban is DeForest Kelly. He seems a bit out of place in a 'Star Trek movie not meant for Star Trek fans' -- but he is an absolute joy to watch in every scene.Zoe Saldana as Uhura is a bit more 'stuck up' than her predecessor, but that's to be expected, I suppose. This is the 21st century:) She's edgy, and very sexy.Simon Pegg, Simon Pegg, Simon Pegg. I want a full on Scotty movie!! John Cho makes for a (finally) kick-butt Sulu! Anton Yelchin as Chekov was a little harder to accept. The accent was so forced, and felt like another case of 'gleeful contempt' on the part of Abrams. Making fun of the accent by engaging in a hyperbolic exaggeration of it. It's only clever when you don't notice it, but the accent is omnipresent in every Chekov scene.Ben Cross as Sarek was a brilliant casting move.Sure, as an old Star Trek fan (I began watching it with my dad in the mid '70s, and I was named after Jeffrey Hunter and even my middle name, Christopher, was chosen because of his Pike character) I can nitpick the heck out of this movie. The science is bad (a black hole is not a wormhole), some of the continuity changes make no sense (which makes one wonder why any effort at all was made to reconcile this re-boot with the original series), etc, etc. I could go on, but it would be giving too much away.But, all in all, it was a fun ride and is one of (if not the) best looking films in the franchise. A little shallow, perhaps, but that seems to be par for the course this movie season. So, maybe it played like a cheesy TV show sometimes but isn't that in the spirit of things? I definitely give it an A for effort. Something had to be done as the franchise had run dry more than a decade ago leading me to abandon the franchise (especially after the arrival of the far superior Babylon 5 series).And remember. If you're going on an away mission, don't wear red!",7,5,12,11 May 2009
Captain Marvel," The most boring movie in the MCU oeuvre. No controversy required.
","Captain Marvel... hmmm. Well, you may have seen all the 'controversy' surrounding this film involving bad advance reviews based on some foolish statements made by Brie Larson in the press that were blown wayyyy out of proportion. The expectation that it would be a relentless, hardcore feminist diatribe left many fans disinterested in seeing the film. After seeing it, I can tell you that there is quite a bit of feminist/girl power messaging in play, but it's the type of shallow, corporate, glad-handing that's going to leave actual feminists angry more than anyone else.
Any scenes of Danvers' actual life or character development? You've seen them all in the trailer.
The problem with Captain Marvel is that, while not being the WORST film in the MCU oeuvre, it is by far the most BORING. Stultifying, even.
Larson's performance is so mind numbing and dull I started to wonder if she was actually a robot or clone that someone hit with a cattle prod off camera to induce some kind of jerky pseudo smile or other simulated snark. Simply awful.
Jackson is OK as Fury, simply along for the ride playing the sidekick role (although the cat jokes get tired fast).
The Starforce, one of the lamest creations of 90s Marvel, makes a seamless transition achieving the same level of 'who gives a s#!t' that you would expect from a set of pathetic, low rent Guardians knock-offs.
The Skrulls. Oh boy, we finally get real Skrulls! One of the biggest threats in the Galaxy!!! Annnnnd, you ruined them... that was fast.
The effects in some scenes were OK, but large chunks of the film exuded such 'cheapness' that I was wondering if I was watching the Inhumans again. And it was inconsistent. While Samuel L Jackson looked great in his CGI de-aged state, Clark Gregg looked like he was sculpted out of wax at times.
Not sure what else to say about such an uninspired product. I'm sure any negative reviews of the film will still be labeled as 'sexist' or what have you (and I do think the gender flip of Mar-Vell is insulting and unnecessary, so feel free to hate on me) but I'm starting to think the whole online controversy is being ginned up by Disney to distract people from the simple fact that they made a bad movie.",2,16,27,7 March 2019
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Pretty good. Not great. Better than X-men 3.
","I saw the midnight showing last night.Yes, the bootlegs been out - but it's missing several FX scenes as well as 20 minutes of story. I got a copy of it, watched about a half an hour late at night, and fell asleep. I didn't bother to watch anymore because I wanted to see the finished product instead.It was pretty good. Not great. Better than X-men 3, but that's not saying much. Liev Schreiber (one of my favorite actors) pulled off Sabretooth nicely, and Ryan Reynolds was perfect as Wade Wilson. Will I Am did surprisingly well. The Blob was pathetic. Gambit was pretty cool, and there are some other cameos that played well.Hugh Jackman's earnestness in Wolverine really helps. He seems to really love being that character.A little disjointed at times (which often happens when you try to cram too many characters into a movie) and it looks like the money was cut off as some of the FX scenes toward the end are pretty weak.I'd give it about a 6.5",6,0,3,1 May 2009
Troy," If you liked Gladiator, see Troy.
","What we have here is a big budget, over the top Hollywood movie. Decent script, with lines delivered with Shakespearian emotion. It was fun. Simple as that. It's like Gladiator 2. A movie you can really get lost in. There are a couple of pacing problem, fast-slow-fast-slow, but overall a worthy night out. Brad Pitt's movements are as impressive as his acting, and Eric Bana has more than redeemed himself for his role in the awful Hulk movie. He is fantastic in this film! A true tragic hero. The CGI was not up to Lord of the Rings standards, but was still excellent. Sweeping battle scenes, and hacking and slashing a plenty! I was very hard on Van Helsing for being a badly made, boring piece of garbage. Believe me, if you have a choice to make, go see Troy!",8,20,40,17 May 2004
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Man 3 is a seriously disappointing mess:(
","I love Raimi's films, but he seriously laid an egg with this one. I heard rumors he had Venom shoved down his throat, and if that's true -- boy, it shows! The character is even more lame and shallow than he is in the comics (if such a thing is possible).Spider-Man 3 tries so hard to fit all these different personalities in that nothing is given a chance to develop, and the final product is nothing but a lifeless action film along the lines of X-Men 3.While Thomas Haden Church does a fantastic Sandman, he is wasted on an infantile script that not only violates his and Spider-Man's origin, but also is responsible for one of the glaring plot holes in the movie.Mary Jane is reduced to a jealous, useless persona, while Aunt May walks in and out of the film spouting platitudes with no substance.Also, there are at least two scenes that are absolutely cringe-worthy and should have been left on the cutting room floor, or never included in this awful script from the start! Lastly, the costume. While in the comics it was very stylish with its large white spider design -- the movie design is merely the regular costume dunked in black dye and is amazingly boring to look at.I'm so tired of comic films wasting their potential on awful third installments because the viewing public is so programmed to automatically like this kind of garbage. So, while this isn't the worst movie of all time by a long shot, its inexcusable lack of quality following two of the greatest comic films ever in Spider-Man 1 & 2 earns part 3 a rating of... 3.",3,2,4,11 May 2007
Cloverfield," Cloverfield delivers the thrills - but haters of the Blair Witch style should be wary!
","So, I went to a 5PM showing of Cloverfield today. It was pretty good. I found the characters to be very human and developed quite nicely over the course of the story. The special effects were excellent, with quite a few 'oh $#!@' moments.Be warned: If Blair Witch Project made you nauseous, then I don't recommend Cloverfield. The *entire* movie is filmed in the 'handy-cam' style of the trailer - but in my opinion, it works better here than in Blair Witch. It helped draw you into the movie and make you feel like you were in it, and it made the CGI more convincing.Very intense film.",8,446,768,18 January 2008
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Nothing to get very excited about
","Saw Spider-Man: Homecoming yesterday, and it was thoroughly... OK. Didn't love it, didn't hate it -- basically because there's not much there to care about either way.It has a very shallow 80s teen film feel to it, like a live action Saturday morning cartoon. So if you can unlock your inner 12 year old and not think too hard about anything, you'll probably enjoy it.The culturally diverse characters are completely two dimensional - full of stereotypical personalities, and all commercially constructed to be easily digestible and likable - which pretty much sums up the movie. The dialogue is very light, complete with a perky, middle-aged-plus gmilf of an Aunt May. The plot is very basic, but with at least two stellar action sequences, solid cgi and a refreshing cast of villains from Vulture and Shocker, to early glimpses of Scorpion and Prowler.Not much else comes to mind. Like I said, it's a very safe, cute movie, seemingly designed to get a substantial number of laughs and avoid controversy. Good one to take your kids to, or grandparents, or boyfriend/girlfriend who doesn't really care about the genre.6.5/10",6,7,12,11 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Send In The Clones
","First, let me say that I am a Star Wars fan. I have been since I stood in line at the theater on that fateful day in 1977, and I've loved everything since, even Phantom Menace (sure, there were bad points, but I was entertained by the film). That having been said... The only real clones are the sorry fans that will go out and see AOTC multiple times to line the pockets of Mr. Lucas. I get the distinct feeling that George resents having to make these films, after all, he's been dealing with the same basic world-scape since 1977, and more is all anyone seems to want from him-- but only more Star Wars. In response, he has delivered unto his fans a lifeless piece of digital film making. The characters are devoid of any depth, and the dialogue is some of the worst I've heard in a long time. I heard open moans of distaste in the theater at the C3-P0-turned-bad-pun-machine on the battle field. I understand the grainy aspects of the special effects are due to the movie being seen on a film projector instead of a digital one, but come on! This is no excuse for the poor overall quality of the project. It brakes the first cardinal sin of movie making: it's booooooorrrrriiing. The film started off well, and my hopes were high. But it peaked after 35 minutes, and then was flat and unimpressive until the final battle, which seemed truncated and unresolved. I know the storyline needs to be unresolved at this point, but there is no payoff within this film. You wait and wait and wait and there's nothing to justify it. Everything you want to see in this film, as far as the progression of the story-- well, it just never happens. And I can't stress enough how terrible the dialogue is. And I'm so sick of how Lucas tries to interject earthlike/human qualities and catch phrase/poses into his new aliens. If you hated the pod race announcers, and Jar Jar's 'Exsqueeze Me' lines, you'll be sick after the diner scene in AOTC. (caution, the next sentence may be considered a spoiler) Oh, and why is it called ATTACK of the Clones? How about... Political Maneuvering of the Clones, or Creation of the Clones, or Whatta' Bunch of Clones. I say this because--- THERE IS NO ATTACK!!!!! So, this film is apparently just build up to Episode 3, and was never intended to have a life of it's own. Is that what you're doing here Mr. Lucas? Overall, a disappointing and depressing movie going experience. When Star Wars disappoints, where can you go? Oh, well......",1,0,1,16 May 2002
Watchmen," Adequate attempt at an unfilmable project. Dumbed down a bit.
","I've heard lots of people walked out, so it probably won't be in theaters long even with the blockbuster opening weekend. Friend at work thought it was the worst movie he'd ever seen, just couldn't follow it. But this is a visual film best served in a theater.Overall, I *would* have given it an 8 (the scene on Mars went beautifully) - except the retarded new ending dragged it down to maybe a 5. Worth seeing. Adequate to the task. Great visuals.Of course many people will like the new ending. It's been dumbed down for the masses. As soon as I heard the ending was changed last year, I predicted it - so it elicited a big yawn from me at the theater (and I don't blame Alan Moore AT ALL for divorcing himself from this project - the re-write is an insult). I can't explain how self-defeating it is without giving too much away for those that haven't seen the movie (but have read the book).I thought there was plenty of action (and sex), but another problem is that everyone seems to be a jacked up super-hero who can punch through or get slammed through concrete walls, etc - when the only one with actual super-powers is supposed to be Manhattan. Another basic level corruption of the source material.They changed Rorschach *slightly* by lessening his hrrrrm vocal tick and streamlining him into kind of a Batman-ish bada@@. He still says it a few times under his breath, as if to substitute it for hmmm. Like 'hmmm. that's interesting' or as a non-verbal response to something seen - not a recurring pattern in his speech that adds to the 'unpleasantness' of being around Rorschach. But other than that, Jackie Earle Haley did a fantastic job! There are several scenes that seem to have animated themselves straight from the comic page as that is Snyder's strength as a director, not his writing. If the new ending is any indication of his ability as a storyteller, his skills are pedestrian at best.Overall I did enjoy the film and I am one of those people that was there in September '86 reading Watchmen #1 off the rack. But I can't let that pathetic ending slide, and it brings the quality of the entire film down.",5,2,4,9 March 2009
28 Weeks Later," Pretty good, but doesn't really compare to 28 Days Later.
","Went to see this last night. Pretty good. It's just not the same kind of thing as 28 Days Later. Less of a 'smart people getting pulled in to a Lord Of The Flies type situation and human nature takes over' and more of a conventional 'stupid people doing stupid things that totally screw up everything.' Danny Boyle's protégé did a good job of emulating his directing style, and Boyle directed some of the 2nd unit scenes -- so if you like the feel of the scenes in 28 Days, you should appreciate the new movie. But it's a different writer, and it shows.At this point, I'm curious about Boyle and (28 Days writer) Alex Garland's sci-fi epic Sunshine -- which seems to playing in every country right now except the US and Canada!!",7,0,4,12 May 2007
Van Helsing," Pure Torture!
","I cannot believe people can actually defend this piece of garbage (unless they work for the stuidio). I actually love B-movies. I love sci-fi, horror and fantasy. I was not looking for a challenging brain-teaser of a movie, or a dramatic tour de force. I was looking for a reason to get high, kick back, and enjoy a special effects laden, fun movie. And so the nightmare began... First off, the script and acting are both terrible. This comes as no surprise, and I expected nothing more. Second-- the special effects were pathetic! I could create better CGI on my home computer! It was so poorly rendered I found it difficult to believe this was a professional production! (Except for some of the Mr. Hyde scene). So, I have to pin my hopes on some good action and directing. Well,  I got neither. There are basically 2 action sequences repeated over and over and over, with I believe 2 pieces of music repeated over and over and over... My god it was so boring! My wife actually had to wake me up saying 'Oh no-- you can't make me suffer through this by myself' 'But it was you're idea hon-- you're the big Hugh Jackman fan' I wish I had walked out. I really do. There's no payoff, no redemption. It is an endless downward spiral of bad production values, terrible acting, and boredom. OH THE BOREDOM! Most disappointing film EVER!",1,6,14,11 May 2004
Spider-Man," Truly Amazing!
","Having just seen the dismal Star Wars Episode 2, I felt compelled to comment on a movie that truly deserves to be seen. Spider-Man is a masterpiece of adventure film making. The pace, dialogue, characterizations, special effects, directing, casting and any other elements you can think of are all masterfully done. Every scene flows into the next. This is coming from a 20 plus year reader of Marvel Comics, so I know the web slinger very well. I even enjoyed the changes in Spidey's origin-- a clever combination of Amazing Fantasy #15, Ultimate Spider-Man #1 and Spider-Man 2099's all genetic powers. The updating of the Goblin suit was refreshing, and made perfect sense in the context of the film. Tobey Maguire's performance is inspired, with even greater turns by Willem Dafoe and James Franco (best supporting actor Oscar? Hmm?). And as always, Kirsten Dunst was wonderful. Beautiful AND talented, how rare is THAT?!? The only drawback to this movie is that Sam Raimi has managed to make such a fantastic comic book adaptation, it makes Brian Singer's X-Men and Tim Burton's Batman look kind of weak. This is the new standard people. Is it Shakespeare? No. Is is Gone With The Wind? No. Is it Empire Strikes Back? No. What it is, however, is the MOST entertaining film I've seen in years-- and THAT is what movie making is all about! Bravo Spider-Man cast and crew! Encore!",10,0,0,16 May 2002
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X-Cited to see the X-Men franchise in top form again!
","X-Men: Days of Future Past. Well, that certainly helped to wipe away my last poor movie experience (the awful Godzilla)! Great to have Bryan Singer back behind at the helm (after the abomination that was the Singer-less X-Men: The Last Stand). This movie attempts to streamline and tie together the two parallel X-Men franchises (original and the excellent First Class), as well as the two Wolverine movies (the first of which is best left forgotten) - and it does a superb job!The story was engaging and fairly complex with some shocking moments. The f/x were top notch and almost seamless. Timeline conflicts between books and films aside, the characters were treated very well - with Blink being one of my favorites.It might be blasphemous to say, but as much as I love Ian McKellan - Michael Fassbender may have surpassed as his performance as Magneto was fantastic, improving on his work in X-Men: First Class.Jennifer Lawrence owns Mystique now. Yeah, Rebecca Romijn might have the better body, but Jennifer blows her away in the acting department - adding so much more depth to the character.McAvoy, like Fassbender, improved on his character from First Class - and who doesn't need more Peter Dinklage?? He scores one of the best scenes in the movie when he speaks before Congress.And Sentinels?? Not what I expected, but totally awesome!Yes, there is some alterations to the time-line after this (and some minor conflicts that have yet to be resolved), as everyone expected, and I'm x-cited to see the next installment as we go back and 'fill in' the new arc. I also can't wait for the Blu-Ray release as I'm sure there will be extra scenes aplenty, and there are so many easter eggs scattered throughout it's going to take a careful still-frame viewing to catch them all.As always -- MAKE SURE YOU STAY UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS!!!!",10,0,1,23 May 2014
Avengers: Endgame," 35% awesome, 65% tedious
","Avengers: Endgame. Overall it was... ok. The intro got off to a quicker start than I imagined, and the expected final battle was certainly fun followed by a touching denouement. Those elements (barely) justify the film, in my opinion.However, the intervening 2 hours is a tedious collection of scenes, lame jokes and awful characterizations wrapped around an extremely tired and poorly thought out plot device. Should you see it? Sure. How can you not after investing so many years in the arc? But most people I saw it with were ultimately (at least somewhat) disappointed.Worst performance in the movie is easily Mark Ruffalo who has now solidified his legacy as the absolute worst Hulk and Banner ever committed to film. Thor was also terrible, but that's been a rapid devolution since Ragnarok.Surprisingly, the movie was pretty much stolen by the stellar performance of Jeremy Renner, which should build interest in the upcoming Hawkeye series (even if it is just a vehicle to hand off the mantle). Scarlett Johansson also stepped up her game and was very impressive.",6,4,8,27 April 2019
X-Men: The Last Stand," Easily the worst of the franchise.
","The phrase I've heard repeated, and rings most true, is 'fast food' movie. This film is more like an MTV music video with gratuitous amounts of action, and an equal amount of characters thrown in for no apparent purpose but to make the audience go 'Oooh - explosions.' Given the rich history of the X-Men, and even the limited history presented in the first two movies, this 3rd installment fails to deliver on any meaningful level. As a casual moviegoer, it is a shallow action film by a lackluster director. As a long standing X-Men fan and reader (25 years) it was a frustrating mess of characters and alterations. Juggernaut is not a mutant, but is presented as one in the film. Callisto is unrecognizable, both in appearance and abilities. Psylocke is a cameo, and non-specific in any way. She has purple hair, therefore she is Psylocke, seems to be the amount of thought put in here.On the plus side, Kelsey puts in an amazing performance as The Beast, and The Angel, while woefully under-used, is quite the achievement. Famke is as beautiful as ever, but her characters potential is wasted on a boring story.One of the most uncomfortable aspects of the movie is Storm's lines. Halle wanted more screen time, but instead of expanding her role as a team leader and a strong female character, we are tortured by a hack script, and Storm acting like a five year old simply repeating other characters lines as affirmation, and to fill up screen time. Simply awful.I give the film a 5 based pretty much on visuals alone.",5,4,5,22 August 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," The Silver Surfer Soars!
","I was lucky enough to get into a preview of FF:ROTSS a couple of weeks ago and like it quite a bit. Granted, it's over the top action and fun, but that's what FF always was to me. Dynamic movement, explosions and cosmic adventure. In many ways, I think this movie succeeded in ways that Spidey 3 failed - most importantly, the way it used multiple antagonists and tied them together. The film was never boring. The Silver Surfer looks amazing, and the voice is perfect!Certainly, this is a far better outing than the first Fantastic Four film, and I look forward to more. The cast have settled into these roles. The film also features Stan Lee's best cameo ever (a direct nod to the comics) and a few other surprises.So, like I said, not exactly brain surgery - but a fun film that, to me, embraced the spirit of the FF.",8,3,7,26 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Fincher delivers another masterpiece.
","Saw 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' last night. I can't resist a new David Fincher film. It deviates wildly from the F. Scott Fitzgerald story (which could be why I liked it so much). The performances, make up, and directing are all amazing. The screenplay is a little slow and meticulous (Eric Roth also wrote the screenplays for Forrest Gump, The Horse Whisperer, Munich, The Good Shepherd) but the directing made it work perfectly (give me Fincher over Mann, DeNiro, Redford, Spielberg or Zemeckis any day). It really doesn't feel like a two and a half hour film.I could easily envision Oscar wins for Fincher, Taraji Henson, Brat Pitt and Cate Blanchett.Be warned - it is a bit of a tear jerker. It deals with mortality quite a bit, as well as the usual heady subjects of love, loss, war, and redemption... with just the right touches of passion and joy.10 out of 10",10,10,17,26 December 2008
Guardians of the Galaxy," A fun, solid effort - but not without its flaws.
","So, with trepidation, I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy on Saturday night. It actually turned out pretty well. I thought the humor was going to be overdone, and indeed by the end of the film several jokes were falling flat. On the plus side, the pace was very fast, the soundtrack was 'ahem' awesome, the FX were top notch and it featured the best filthy Jackson Pollock joke ever.Chris Pratt as Star-Lord is OK with the humorous scenes, but when that wore thin there wasn't much left to expect from him. He's just not a very good actor when you're looking for depth.The Drax character was performed very well by Dave Bautista (better known as Batista from the WWE). The writing could have been better though, as the dialogue sometimes felt forced in an attempt to define his race's particular mode of expression. It reminded me at times of the Star Trek: TNG episode 'Darmok.' But again, Bautista did a fine job.Gamora was the biggest disappointment. Her character was ruined by non- committal, lazy writing. She's one of the biggest bad-asses in the Galaxy, and yet she is often portrayed as a damsel in distress – then suddenly an unstoppable fighter, then a damaged girl with daddy issues, then a victim, then a poor waif who must resist Star-Lord's advances – when in fact (if we were being faithful to the character) she would have screwed his brains out, injuring him in the process. You DO NOT F%$K with Gamora!Rocket was great. They didn't over-think it, and just let Rocket be Rocket. Bradley Cooper did a great voice-over job.Groot is Groot. Like Rocket, they just went with it. Thankfully they didn't overdo the 'I am Groot' shtick. It was just enough to balance the annoying with the funny.Ronan the Accuser was done well. He's even more severe than he is in the book, playing him up like a religious zealot. There are plenty of Easter eggs to look for, especially in The Collector's base of operations. There's an absolutely fantastic appearance by Thanos, and as usual make sure you stay through the credits for a surprise cameo from an obscure and subversive Marvel character!Even with its faults, GOTG is a fun ride and I am relieved to be able to recommend it wholeheartedly!",7,3,7,4 August 2014
Logan," Low expectations met... barely.
","I honestly don't understand the hype on this film. Saw it last night, and while there are some great action scenes with a brilliant amount of gore (finally), the film is poorly paced, largely boring, and full of the kind of lame, trite action movie tropes you'd expect from James Mangold in the second half oh his career.There is almost no correlation to Old Man Logan, instead becoming a hodgepodge of three other stories that I won't mention the titles of due to possible spoilers.As the title of the review states, I went in with low expectations. The movie barely delivered on them. In fact, the more I think of all the lame story ideas and self referential garbage forced into the script, the less I like the film.",5,2,8,6 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The Golden Age of Marvel movies is OVER
","This is a perfect example of how success can ruin a franchise. So much money is changing hands now that the Marvel movies are quickly descending into the pattern of dumbing down - attempting to satisfy the masses, resulting in inferior product.While still somewhat enjoyable, the movie suffers from MANY flaws, and not all are the fault of Marvel/Disney - some are to be laid at the feet of Joss Whedon, justifying my initial fears of having the tween darling master of the Buffy-verse in charge of these films.Specifically, the love stories Whedon fought so hard to include are stultifying and sleep-inducing - or just downright Lucas-level stupid. The dream sequences he championed are also all but useless time-killers.The movie is loaded with SO MANY one-liners, it's impossible to take anything seriously, and the jokes become tiresome. Ultron is less a world threat, and more a sardonic stand up comedian. Everyone seems to want a piece of the popularizing Stark humor (even though a Stark spoken rape joke backfired horribly with feminist audience members).There are some excellent action sequences, while at the same time there are several overdone CGI scenes that are almost unwatchable, much like a Michael Bay film.The addition of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch do absolutely nothing for the movie. Both actors give incredibly boring performances, and the power set of Scarlet Witch is unrecognizable in comparison to her comic book counterpart. Baron Von Strucker is also rendered completely useless after quite a bit of build up in previous films and TV.The character of Black Widow is basically reduced to a whore (for the Red Room, for Nick Fury, whatever).The brightest spot in the whole film is The Vision. They achieved something special with the creation and execution of that character.Again, it wasn't entirely unenjoyable. I love these characters and am amazed to living in a time when I get to see them on the big screen, but with all these glaring flaws, I can only give it a 5 out of 10.I am now very leery of all Marvel films going forward, and expect nothing more than a 'joke-explosion-joke-explosion-joke-lame love story- joke-explosion' formula to dominate all future projects.",5,7,16,5 May 2015
Midsommar," Another masterpiece for Ari Aster
","Director Ari Aster said this was a film about dependency which he wrote during a breakup
... and it shows. But it's so much more.A commentary on religion, friendship, depression, identity -- all inside an extremely unsettling Swedish folklore, sex cult, horror story. And it's funny, too! Yes, all these ideas exist simultaneously in a brilliant and methodically paced film that frolics in the realm between all things Kubrick and the Wicker Man.There are layers upon layers, clues given, and a deliberately hypnotic and hallucinigenic sensibility that lolls the senses so that the more graphic scenes of graphic horror hit with jarring impact. Moreso, to me, than in Aster's previous film Heritary (the best film of 2018). Not for fans of quick cut commercial fare, the timid or the squeamish, Midsommar is a beautiful, horrifying meta-gestalt that I look forward to viewing again.",9,8,12,5 July 2019
The Fountain," Instantly one of my Top 10 films of all time.
","I bought the hardcover graphic novel when it first came out, just couldn't wait. I should go back and re-read it, but my first impression of the film was surprise at how *little* it actually deviated from the graphic novel.I'm going to see the movie again as soon as possible. Maybe tonight, or at the very latest Sunday.I can't remember the last time I shed tears in a movie theater. The visuals, combined with the themes of hope, loss & redemption, were almost overwhelming. At times it had that ethereal '2001-ish' quality, but tempered by Aronofsky's humanism.-Jeff",10,8,16,24 November 2006
Wonder Woman," Easily the best DCU movie since 2008's Batman: The Dark Knight
","I saw Wonder Woman on Sunday night, and it's one of those rare movies that after mulling over I actually like a bit more than my initial opinion upon viewing. Not that I'm going to say it's some kind of tear inducing piece of theatrical perfection, because it's not. It has its faults like any other film: a superfluous and unnecessary framing sequence, the typical (albeit brief) pacing problems in the middle, repetitive action sequences (not counting the much lauded – and deservedly so – charge into 'No Man's Land' scene) a cheesy ending (the levels and details of which I can't discuss without revealing major plot points) and a couple of lame jokes (how many times are they going to use the 'Wonder Woman loves ice cream' gag?) – most of which can be blamed on the screenplay by the usual suspects, Allan Heinberg and Zack Snyder.That being said, the positive things about Wonder Woman are legion in comparison.Obviously, the casting of Gal Gadot worked beautifully. Being one of the only positive elements in the abysmal Batman V Superman movie, her quality as the lead is now amplified. She already had the attitude and presence for the character, now bolstered by a more muscular physique and clearer (yet wonderfully distinct) accent. Gadot made it look easy, projecting power and confidence in her moral obligation to the world, while also having those moments of somewhat vulnerable naiveté in a world she is only just discovering.Patty Jenkins is a thousand times the director that Zack Snyder is. She understands the value of a solid story and consistent character development. It was wonderful to see supporting characters developed enough to actually care about them, and the way Jenkins maneuvered through the potential political minefield this project presented was masterful. Case in point – the aforementioned 'No Man's Land' sequence. Not only was it a taught and exciting action scene, but the mutual respect and camaraderie that developed between the primary cast members was about as perfect a message about equality as one could hope for.Even subjects like the suffragette movement in the UK, employment, sexuality (cleverly referencing the writings of a Greek muse to explain the obviousness of lesbianism on Themyscira) (Chris Pine's awesome 'bathing beefcake' scene) and even the white man's treatment of Native Americans were handled with humor and grace (instead of a browbeating), reminding me of the work of Michele Fazekas & Tara Butters on the excellent and lamented Agent Carter TV series. Perhaps it's easier when working on a period piece in 1916 where there are examples of sexism so obvious and blatant that everyone can look at it and go 'No, that is wrong.' There's even a pseudo-bondage scene near the end for those hardcore fans of Wonder Woman's early comic years.The supporting cast was excellent, with the possible exception of David Thewlis whose performance I found thoroughly uninspiring (especially in comparison to his work on the current season of Fargo) and some of Connie Nielsen's lines while trying to emulate Gadot's accent were a bit cringe inducing. All in all, it's a very positive movie experience in terms of both theme and quality. I'm actually disappointed it didn't have a bigger opening weekend considering super hero movies are still in vogue and Wonder Woman is one of the top 5 most recognizable and popular super heroes in history! It's relatively family-friendly – aside from wartime violence (loud noises, deaths, etc) and the only love scene is alluded to but not shown.8.3/10 Easily the best DCU movie since 2008's Batman: The Dark Knight",8,1,6,6 June 2017
Iron Man," Ranks among the best of the Marvel movies!
","I saw it opening night. I consider among the best of the Marvel movies thus far, on par with X-Men 2 and Spider-Man 2.Downey is absolutely brilliant as Tony Stark - a genius piece of casting on so many levels. As a long time Marvel reader and Robert Downey fan, it was great to be able to 'read into' the performance the idea that Stark - although he is madly successful - is a fragile human being with a crippling addiction. It'll be great when and if they get to the alcoholism in Iron Man 2.It seemed to me to be an altered retelling of Iron Man 198-200 by Denny O'Neil (from 1985). A classic in my book!",10,1,3,14 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Nothing new under the sun...
","Sadly, not blown away by Force Awakens.Beautiful special fx -- an almost perfect blending of digital and practical elements.Solid casting, throughout. Like the new characters.The story, however, was very safe and very predictable. Too much self reference and regurgitation of previous episodes. Not a bad movie, but it never really 'took off' to me.I don't want to outright bash the movie, but it's really just 'ok' - which is the inevitable result of a Disney committee forged product that strives to give fans exactly what they (think) they want, and try to satisfy every possible demographic to make it an eminently consumable product. And that's what it is. Lucas hit it on the head when he basically said 'yeah, people should like it.'You SHOULD LIKE IT. And I do. But I certainly don't love it.",6,13,26,18 December 2015
Godzilla," Save your money. Avoid this awful movie. No joke.
","Just got back from Godzilla. Wow, what an amazingly bad film. So mind numbingly boring, it's hard to even express it. If you go, just hang out in the lobby, eat some popcorn, chat with your friends and then head in to the theater for the last 20 minutes. You'll have a much better time. Truly one of the worst theater experiences I've had in recent history.Much of the CGI is darkened to hide its flaws. The green screen lines are easily visible (sometimes in scenes that are otherwise cinematically beautiful). The human characters are Completely one dimensional, uttering terrible dialogue the likes of which haven't been heard since Attack Of The Clones - and that includes Bryan Cranston who must have known that the lines coming out of his mouth were utter, nonsensical garbage.The new monsters are using the same trite design mode established in Cloverfield (to much better effect), while Godzilla (who lumbers around like an arthritic 108 year old man) is held back until the final act and criminally underused.Matthew Broderick must be dancing for joy knowing he won't be the Godzilla community's goat anymore.",1,28,59,17 May 2014
V for Vendetta," Excellent (with some reservations)
","Well, just returned from seeing the movie... again.As a movie, all on its own, I liked it. Obviously, having just watched it a 2nd time is as many days:) If you're looking for a direct translation, you're out of luck. Evy is played differently, other characters are amalgamated, sub-plots eliminated, events transpire out of order, etc -- standard comic-to-movie fare. However, even though much of V's dialog is changed, Hugo Weaving brings V to life in brilliant fashion (although the 'movie V' is less vicious than the 'book V').All the core moments of the book are there, and some scenes are taken verbatim (or close to it) right from the printed page. The general feel has been updated, and subject matter as well to make the story more contemporary.And therein lies my only major complaint. I have no issue with a film maker creating a *new* film, and injecting it with a current, topical nature (as George Lucas did) but I'm disappointed that the Wachowski Bros felt they had to so alter Alan Moore's work. I can totally understand Moore's reaction to the script, and the simplifying for general movie audiences.If you haven't read the book in years (I re-read it today for the first time I'm MANY years), or not at all, you may want to see the movie first - otherwise, you may be disappointed. Try to take the movie as an entity unto itself.-JeffVI VERI VENIVERSUM VIVUS VICI",9,4,9,19 March 2006
