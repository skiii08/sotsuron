The Blair Witch Project," Wonderfully intelligent film
","I have seen BWP three times now and each time I emerge from the theater amazed at what I have seen. I have laughed, wondered, and cringed at the things I have seen and the things that can only be imagined. I especially enjoy this movie because it allows the viewer to 'fill in the blanks' with whatever their mind can conjure up. No amount of blood and gore can compare to the unnatural thoughts of anyone. I am often disappointed, however, when I leave the theater and I hear comments such as 'That wasn't very realistic- her eyebrows didn't even grow much!' (True, I heard this!) I think many people are looking for a cheap thrill and it won't be found here. BWP is an intelligent horror film which intelligent people will enjoy.",Null,1,2,18 August 1999
Fight Club," I'm speechless
","I have just returned from seeing 'Fight Club' and I must admit I haven't the words right now, but I will try. I really enjoyed 'Fight Club'; the violence, the humor, the thought-provoking dialogue-but, only one complaint. The 'plot twist' as you may call it really cramped the movie's style. I thought the movie was way too sophisticated to resort to some sort of gimmick. Maybe I am missing the point the twist was trying to make about some aspect of humanity-I don't know. All I know is my first reaction to that twist was disappointment and confusion. I know if I sat here long enough and really thought about the meaning of it all, I would think that we as humans could very well end up trying to be something that we are not and do things that we may not normally do, as the character did in this movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a really decent dry wit and a plot that, even if it does throw you for a loop, makes you think about our society and our compliance of living a materialistic, ritualistic life with no surprises.",Null,0,1,1 November 1999
American Psycho," Oscar Worthy Performance By Bale
","This movie was very dark. Not in the gory, bloody sense, however, in a sinister, witty way. Christian Bale gives a very complex performance bringing the character of Patrick Bateman to life. At times I even sympathized with his character because Bale had the talent to make Bateman a multi-faceted human being. This movie is not merely a commentary on the 80's, only its focus. The movie says a lot about society; what it is really saying is that we really are superficial and really don't take the time to know people. Maybe all we are concerned with is the appearance of those with whom we associate, not with who that person really is. Most people may not appreciate this wonderful film. If you want to see a layered, brilliant movie, go see this film and I assure that you will not be disappointed.",Null,0,0,14 April 2000
