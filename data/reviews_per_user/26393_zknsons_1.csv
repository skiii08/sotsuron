The Benchwarmers," Benchwarmers
","This was the funniest movie I have ever seen. I have never laughed so hard at a movie as this one. The message behind all the funny stuff was great.I think it is a great movie to see with the family. My three boys ages 10, 8, and 6 really enjoyed it too. We will are for sure go to see it again.Not everyone will like this movie you really need to have a sense of humor.I was not expecting for it to be that funny.So it was a great surprise.So if you want to see a funny movie this movie is a must see.You will be laughing hours after the movie.They could have not picked three better actors to play in this movie.They were great. So if you want a good laugh you have to go see this movie. Just warning you your gut might hurt after from all the laughing.",10,4,11,8 April 2006
