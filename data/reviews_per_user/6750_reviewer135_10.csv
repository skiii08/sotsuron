Blade Runner 2049," Cute story with flying cars and 'Her' reprieve
",Ok I missed something. They restart making Tyrell corp making replicants and some of the new replicants are now the Blade Runners to hunt down 1st gen replicants.Wasn't the whole point of the original blade runner was that the 1st gen replicants had a built in death date(except for Rachel)??? They should all be dead by now?So the new Corporation is desperate to find the baby because they feel the baby would be the key for Replicants making Replicants and is a good thing. And the underground Replicants want to find the baby to protect the replicant race. And the blade runner is working under direction of the police is charged to find and destroy the baby to avoid the baby being a martyr for the Replicants. If that is the gist of the movie then why is the new corporation helping the Blade Runner with old records and investigations of the Replicants. I guess ultimately the Company did kill the police chief and was using the Blade Runner as a rabbit to track him to the child. It just seems that in the end they are both working towards the same goal to find the child to save her. So why were they fighting? Rough story line that just seems forced.,4,3,5,27 January 2018
Source Code," great thought provoking movie but loses it at the end
","This was a very well acted and great story line movie. the premise is that a dead person has 8 minutes of short term memory that is retained in their brain after death. The another person could 'inject themselves' into this short term memory time window and relive the last moments of a persons life. To me this was a unique and interesting concept. It is very believable that such technology may one day exist to essentially 'playback' a person's dieing short term memories. So the movie gradually builds on this theme and it does make you think. However the movie crashes in the end, again in my opinion. I will be the first to admit that maybe I just didn't get it but i didn't get it. The ending turned supernatural with time travel fantasy that really detracted from a good movie. Still it is definitely worth a rent and watch.",7,1,3,28 November 2012
Shutter Island," IMDb has this movie over-rated
","Warning: IMDb has this rated as an 8 right now and this is not an 8 movie. It is not a bad movie but you will be disappointed if you save this movie for a special night. It is more of a good afternoon type movie but you do need to pay attention so no paying bills or doing laundry during the movie.Leonadro DiCaprio does a decent job but he has had better movies. His acting here is a little forced and not great. Anthony Hopkins would have been a much better choice for the role. The movie lacked flow and directing was pretty poor. Martin Scorsese films really set-up a scene and situation to highlight the actor and unfortunately Leonardo didn't bring his 'A' game. Maybe I'm being to critical because the movie meandered around too much for anybody to really shine. The whole movie is just a really long set-up for the ending. The ending is cute but I felt a little jipped since I just struggled through a 2 hour setup.So, not bad, I recommend watching it, just don't get your hopes too high.",6,4,8,7 August 2010
Divergent," Wow, so much potential lost by a lazy author
","This movie is a good concept but it is as frustrating as somebody playing 'is' on a triple word square in scrabble. what a waste! it is a movie made from a popular book. Like the hunger games, it is teenage angst where life is impossibly hard to be a teenager. Unlike the hunger games it isn't realistic. The basic premise of the story is stupid but the symbolism is still there. In the future everybody belongs to 1 of 5 specialized government groups to perform each activity of society. Normally children join the clan of their parents but at 18 they are free to choose any clan they want. Excellent symbolism of a large meeting hall and each kid called to the front and cuts their hand and drips blood into a pot signifying their choice. They are never allowed to change their choice thereafter. Great imagery to real life choices of college and career faced to young kids, but the movie just gets stupid after that. One clan wants to eliminate the other clan and brain washes all of the protectors into fighting their battle but the 'divergent' people (not clearly dis-positioned to a specific clan as indicated by the 'test') are not brain-washable. So she recognizes the plot and stops the take over. The significance of being 'divergent' parallels nothing in real life and the clan vs clan battle is a weakly veiled liberal attack on the Military being nothing more than brain washed bullies being used as pawns by the politicians. So GREAT potential of struggles of growing up with major life choices but lost in poor story, bad author..try harder, it was right in front of you and you got lazy!!!!",6,0,0,18 August 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," ehhhhhhhh
","Tom Cruise should either produce or act, not both. To me the movie came across very self-serving to Tom Cruise and all the other actors were meaningless sidekicks just to frame the next scene with Tom Cruise. The movie did have Simon Pegg who is one of the funniest actors ever and one time Simon was able to break the scene away from the 'Tom Cruise' show to create a funny exchange with one of the other sidekicks and the phrase 'and I will catch you' :) The movie does have decent action and nail biting tension scenes for those afraid of heights. It has good pacing and gadgets just not the good chemistry between the actors because I believe Tom is so overbearing. It is time for him to move to directing and stay out of the movies. It is not a bad movie and for a big budget film, $0.80 on the dollar is not a bad return for the film's enjoyment.",6,0,2,15 July 2012
Big Hero 6," long, tedious, and not very funny
","I am surprised of the high ratings here. This is not a very good movie. I watched it in a crowded afternoon theater full of kids and there was only maybe 2 laugh scenes both of which are shown in the previews on the TV. The kids in the theater were so bored at the end of the ~2hour movie they were looking for something else to do in the theater. This is another Disney outsourced flop that has all of the technical details of a great movie but no soul.Maybe I am too negative because Disney is coming off a truly great movie in Frozen. So you know they can do it, but this movie just never clicks. It is just forced like it was developed in an India animation sweatshop. Disney needs story tellers.I won't give out any spoilers because it is a good movie to kill an afternoon with kids but just lower your expectations and you would be better off to wait for the DVD.",5,85,224,9 November 2014
Sicario," Main story is ridiculously and insulting to true situation
",great scenery of El Paso and Juarez true streets and violence but ridiculous story and terrible acting. Critic over-rated because nobody is willing to down play a movie about the tragedy of the drug cartel violence. But in reality a documentary would have been more impactful. By intermixing a fake situation with absurd American actors into the real life violence is just insulting to the situation. The happy go lucky CIA bad cop doing good things = terrible actor; the frivolous female cop whose only purpose in the movie is to gasp at the horror then pretend to be the big girl and join in the fight with sissy slaps = terrible actress; The Colombian hit-man was good and played the dark quiet Clint Eastwood character good but since the story sucked it was just him walking around and grunting. Note: the real story is hidden in this bad movie and it is a short sub-plot of a Mexican cop and his family caught up in the drug cartel violence. Confusing why this was there when watching the movie but afterwards you realize it was the movie.. Very powerful and true to life of really a good man but just caught up in working for the cartels. This should have been the entire movie with more back story of how he became entrapped.,3,0,1,16 January 2016
Dark Shadows," Edward scissor-hands re-visit with no direction
","I generally like Tim Burton because his quirky attention to detail to sets and costumes but sometimes he leaves the movie behind. This is the case here. I was unaware that Dark Shadows was a previous TV series so this is a review just of the movie. The movie lacked any direction or focus and just seemed to meander around trying to get to the next joke in which every punch line was already broadcast in the previews. Literally there was nothing new to the plot that wasn't spoiled in the previews.Johnny Depp was given no direction by Tim Burton and as a result he just revisited his Edward Scissorhands persona by holding his hands up in every scene and flicking his fingers around like they had uncomfortable poles attached to each finger. His role was aggressive and out-going character but retarded. A tiny Songstress in a box??? and why attack the box??? OK, I get zany but his role kept flipping from dark evil powerful to retarded 3 stooges zany. This did not work.Go to watch Tim Burton's 70's sets and the fantastic bright yellow Chevy station wagon in the movie. Literally the only cringe for me during the entire movie is when they unloaded a coffin from the back of the station wagon and it looked like they may scratch the tail gate, no!!!! Don't expect much other then giggling school girls in the audience from Depps performance.",4,6,11,15 May 2012
Wonder Woman," Don't believe the haters; this is a great superhero movie
",I am a guy so this may be a little slanted but this was a fantastic heroin movie. Wonder Woman is a powerful but naive woman of superhuman power. Great story line as she realizes the true human nature. The movie is long but for me never slows down and i wished it was twice as long. The actress playing wonder woman does a great job portraying a heroine who battles out of dedication and love for mankind with wide eyed enthusiasm. Yes the story get far-fetched like it is a good thing the machine gunner aimed directly at the shield instead of at her feat. But a great addition to the Marvel family with a great background story. In the end she discovers the power of love brings her the quiet confidence to defeat the god of war. Very romantic and maybe sexist but great heroine.,10,16,31,24 September 2017
Moonrise Kingdom," aaarggghhh; another terrible self congratulatory tripe production
","And the Emmy goes to ..... nobody in this total piece of garbage. This is like 10 different actors trying to steal the scene running in different directions; throw in a editor that is only concerned in getting the properly framed picture and a director that will take the movie miles in a random direction to get to one line he thinks is cool. Net effect is white noise of very good acting and cinematography but each item reading from a different script. The movie tries DESPERATELY to come across shy, sweet, lovable, childhood innocence but fails due to over direction and complete lack of story. The actors are each in their on rite extremely strong and well developed characters. Especially the children actors come across as extremely strong characters but since there is literally NO STORY LINE the actors are forced to try to improv a story. This movie would be unaffected if instead it was each actor standing on a stage for a 15 minute soliloquy.",3,14,26,28 November 2012
