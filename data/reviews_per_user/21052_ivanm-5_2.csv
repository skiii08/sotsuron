Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Much slower than Vol 1 but a satisfying conclusion to the story
","Kill Bill Vol 1 was an out-and-out comic book romp, full of violence but always with tongue firmly in cheek. The violence count is severely reduced in Vol 2 but arguably more disturbing. The big difference is that Vol 2 is about the characters rather than the action. Here we begin to find out who these people really are and that, despite there penchant for assassination, they are real flesh-and-blood human beings. The result is that expectations of another high-speed violence-fest are dashed but the seemingly chaotic events of the first film finally get explained. The pace slackens quite markedly towards the end causing an audible amount of fidgeting in the theatre where I viewed it but sitting it out to the end is well worthwhile. As before, Tarantino presents the story in a variety of film styles, my particular favorite being the black-and-white Film Noir that opens the movie. I'd love to see Tarantino do a whole movie in this style but I'm not sure his attention-span would last that long.",8,1,2,11 May 2004
Big Fish," Beautifully made, well-acted but just plain boring.
","Okay, it must be me! Every one else seems to think this film is great but I thought it wasawful. Beautifully made, well-acted but just plain boring.I like the idea of the tale-telling father and the son who just doesn'tget what his father is all about. Unfortunately, the stories the fathertells all seem to be pale imitations of fairy-tales, all show and nosubstance. True fairy-tales have a darkness at their heart, fableshave a moral. The stories shown here just seem to exist simply toprovide the opportunity for nice visuals.As a time-filler for the under-tens this is fine but as a greatmovie...? Like I said, it must be me!",3,2,8,27 July 2004
