Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force is strong in this one...
","Negative criticism is completely unfounded!The Light saber duels alone are worth  the price of a ticket!!Remember: The Star Wars epic ultimately portrays the rise and fall (and the subsequent redemption) of Anakin Skywalker.  To me, this movie suggests that perhaps it is Obi-Wan Kenobi who is the ultimate hero.Rather than detracting from the plot, the record amount of CGI on screen *entertains* the audience.  Uncle George is blessed with amazing creativity. For us, he invents an entire galaxy that includes wonderous droids, spaceships, and intelligent beings.  How priviledged we are to know it.9.5 out of 10",Null,0,0,21 May 1999
