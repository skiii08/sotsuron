Skyfall," James Bond tries a reboot, but it's a power off instead.
","This is a reboot of the James Bond franchise and it could have been so much much better.When we think about the old James Bond movies we remember borderline crazy stunts and humor combined with action. Skyfall tries to be funny at times but only the hardcore James Bond fans will maybe chuckle a little.For the rest of us it just becomes bad...The action in the movie is just old, old school action. If anyone have watched the Jason Bourne movies you know what I mean.The plot is boring and you know what is going to happen almost the entire time, and the bad guy goes from a genius to a dumb goon. The soundtrack is boring and it's just a movie you rent for a Sunday flick.",5,6,13,23 February 2013
