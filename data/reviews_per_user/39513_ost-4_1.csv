Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Roger rules.
","This is really a classic detective-story with all the classic elements and characters, BUT...Toons are involved...lots of toons. Its very funny to see toons from all the studios (Warner Bros, Disney etc.) on screen at the same time. The movie is set in a 1947 Hollywood where toons are moviestars and live life thereafter.Bob Hoskins is great as the drunken detective Eddie Valiant and Christopher Lloyd performs suprisingly well as the psychotic Judge Doom.Perfect setting, great cast, wonderful effects, details and script. I very much like this movie. Overall, a film experience unlike any other.",Null,0,1,15 September 2000
