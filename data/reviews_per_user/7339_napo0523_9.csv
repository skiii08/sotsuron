Enchanted," Enchanted!
","'Enchanted' is a Walt Disney's musical film. I am not a big fan of musical films, but I think this film is one of the excellent films! In Andalasia, Giselle and Prince Edward love each other. They promise to marry, however, they are separated each other by Queen Narissa. They come to human world and look for them each other. Actually, I love Walt Disney's films and I often watch them. But this film is a little different from other films. This is half an actuality film and half an animated film. This point fascinated me so much. This is because actuality films make us feel like more real than animated films. I really love this point. If you like Disney movies or musical movies, you should try it! I really recommend you this film!",8,1,1,5 September 2013
