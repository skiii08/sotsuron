Resident Evil: Afterlife," Awesome movie from start to end
","This was the second best Resident Evil i have seen. This movie has all a guy wants in a movie girls with guns, awesome special effects, a great story, and all in 3D. This one wasn't exactly my favorite, but I still loved it. It wasn't better than Resident Evil Extinction, but still action packed the whole way through. I think that that this is some of Milla's best work. I also thought that the axeman and Claire were terrific too. The thought of a movie based on video games would be pretty stupid, but this proves me wrong by a long shot. i almost walked out of the theater without knowing of Jill valentine in the end during the credits. It's really sad that this has a 5.9 as a rating, but this is way better than what people have said about it.",9,3,7,1 September 2012
