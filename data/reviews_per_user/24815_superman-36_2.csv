The Blair Witch Project," Very good film!!!
","If you was expecting a scary moving you would probably be disappointed but I think it was a great movie. It wasn't really scary but I did check my doors when the film was finished. I think the camera-work was great and the actors too. A lot people might not like the film because of all the cursing, but I think that made it very real. I wouldn't imagine myself without saying F*ck about 60 times in a situation like that. A lot of people hated the camera-angle but I think it really adds something believable to the film.I think the ending of the film a masterpiece, it reminded me of a x-files episode. The ending left everything open to you own imagination. I think this ending is a lot better then that everyone got killed or went home alive.I rate this original movie a 9 out of 10.If you are going to watch this movie don't expect a horror movie.A great movie which was ruined by the second part.",Null,0,1,1 December 2000
X-Men," Mmmm, reasonable. Not very special.
","Nice action movie but not re-newing. I expected a lot more. Bad storyline, too fast and simple. It could have been much more if it would have been thought through a couple of times. I thought it would have been the 2000 matrix.Acting was good but not superb, could have been a better cast.It was just a normal action flick, enjoyable, but nothing more.",Null,0,0,25 September 2000
