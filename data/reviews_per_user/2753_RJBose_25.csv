Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Revenge of the Nerd
","Having not seen the first installment of this two part series, I was curious to see whether or not 'Kill Bill, Volume II' could stand on its own as an entertaining and interesting story.  The short answer is no.  Most bad films have bad writing, bad direction, bad photography and bad acting.  KB II is actually quite strong in each of these departments, but it is in general so bizarre that each of these elements is overcome in what is some type of twisted homage and loveletter from Director Tarentino (a kung-fu movie nerd is his youth) to star Uma Thurman. Perhaps with the well known rampage of blood and gore of its predecessor having been accomplished, KB II apparently is filling in the blanks on some of the issues raised in KB I.  Knowledge of the first part might make the second part more intrinsically interesting, but KB II drags along with long sequences of essentially pretty and clever, but dull movie-making, punctuated by occasional outbursts of exceptional violence and stark ugliness. If you have some sort of fetish for Uma, and an unnatural fascination with martial arts films, KB II is definitely a must-see.  For the rest of us, however, living well, and seeing another movie, might be the best revenge.",5,2,3,25 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Movie
","There is much to criticize and precious little to praise in this swollen, overblown and overhyped mess of a movie. Technically it is 'state-of-the-art' but that is not why people want to see this 'first' of the Star Wars' saga; people want to see an entertaining and exciting preamble to the 6th, 7th and 8th episodes, and in that mission 'Phantom Menace' dismally fails.Perhaps we have all become jaded, but so many parts of this movie seem to be modified, or lifted directly from other, older movies and even television shows:  the soldier 'droids' even speak like the Cylons of 'Battlestar Gallactica' (and how handy to have 'non-living' light saber fodder), the set battle between the Jar Jar people and the battle droids looks like the ancient '300 Spartans' battle against the Persians made long ago and far away in Hollywood, Liam's swordwork could be taken from his Scottish epic (and much better film) Rob Roy.For Star Wars purists, and even casual observers (I among the latter) there is a difficulty in cheering on the precocious young Skywalker (future father of Luke) when we know he is to become Darth Vader.  The scenes of young Darth racing rockets and subsequently flying a star fighter are a bit too much, even for a six year-old with 'the Force'.  Much is sacrificed to cute and precocious remarks from this wooden young actor.In short, it is ponderously dull in long stretches, and seems to have lost all the creative spark and excitment of the first series.  As Jar Jar might say, 'How wude'.",5,0,1,7 June 1999
The Big Lebowski," Well worth seeing.
","The film is quirky and funny, but it's much deeper on an intellectual level, if that's what you're into.  The portrayal of California as the final outpost of the mythic American West is subtle but definitely present. 'Dude' (Jeff Bridges) and his pathetic loser friends are quite content with their pathetic lives, and make no excuses as they feel none are necessary. This symbolizes the freedom represented by the American West, and the promise of the frontier.  Aside from this, however, it's very funny, particularly in the use of film angles and perspectives.  'Dude' (note the Western allusion) is suddenly embroiled in a case of mistaken identity, a kidnapped millionaire's teenage second wife, and his efforts to remain calm in the ensuing mayhem in which he finds himself. It is well written, and well worth seeing, especially with a few beers, and a few friends.",Null,0,0,8 January 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Yo Ho, Yo Ho- A Pirate's Life For Me!
","'The Curse of the Black Pearl' is a sun-drenched pirate adventure story of the second tier which combines with first rate special effects and engaged acting to create a very entertaining movie- one certain to be included among movie 'classics'. Employing many of the usual pirate movie themes and locales, (and, if you look closely enough, incorporating several very carefully reconstructed scenes from the eponymous Disneyland ride) 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' reproduces storms at sea, broadside fussilades and deck to deck combat with thoroughly updated techniques and technology which is truly a pleasure to behold- assuming you like movies with such plot necessities in the first place.  It reminded me of the old movies I used to watch on Saturday or Sunday afternoons when I was growing up (I am in my mid-forties), but improved 1000% in terms of special effects and technological prowess. I have never really understood the aura enjoyed by Johnny Depp, but he is actually quite entertaining in the role of the erstwhile pirate captain trying to take revenge against his mutinous shipmates and regain his ship (The Black Pearl).  In interviews he has proclaimed that his inspiration for the character was Keith Richards, of the Rolling Stones.  (Perhaps he channels this role too well, as at times Captain Sparrow seems a bit too much like a stumbling, addled-brained junkie).  The girl from 'Bend It Like Beckham' is quite good (and very fetching) as the mandatory high official's daughter kidnapped by the fearsome (and cursed) pirate band, and Orlando Bloom, plays the role of the honorable hero who tries to save her, very convincingly. As a boy, a favorite scene in a favorite movie of mine was when in 'Jason and the Argonaughts' Jason and his crew fought the skeletons of the men killed by the Hydra.  This scene is also similar to some of the battles in Brandon Fraser's 'Mummy' films.  The cursed pirate crew of the Black Pearl appear in skeleton form under moonlight, and move in and out of their 'real' appearance with astonishing ease and 'realism'.  It is truly an inspired and brilliant piece of CGI, and really makes the movie. The story is sound, with a few interesting plot twists, though the film may drag a bit towards the end, and wrap things up somewhat unconvincingly.  All told, however, even if dead men tell no tales, this is a really good movie (though maybe a bit too scary for small children) and well worth a few pieces of eight.",9,0,1,13 July 2003
The Mummy," Old Fashioned Matinee Fun!
","This is a thoroughly modernized 'Mummy' which benefits from all of the marvels of modern technology, (the film, that is, although the Mummy himself is a much more healthy and robust fellow than in the '30s original- once he has regenerated to fulfill his curse), making for an exciting, interesting and entertaining movie.   The Mummy is much more of an adventure story (along the lines of the Indiana Jones films) than the tired, plodding retreads we have all come to expect from Hollywood these days.  The technical effects alone really make it quite worth watching.  The story, though familiar, is retold with imagination, wit and indeed some intellectual curiosity.   Brandon Fraser comports himself very well as the adventurer/hero (although what he was doing with the French Foreign Legion, or a Cairo jail some years later, in the opening scenes is never really explained- but that's a minor detail).  The heroine is not just the helpless fussy female for comic relief (as with the 'Temple of Doom' or those Michael Douglas movies with Danny DiVito); she is a scholar, and plays pivotal roles in the story and plot.   The movie starts out in ancient Egypt, showing who the Mummy was (is) and why he was cursed.  The opening of the tomb, invoking of the curse, and prevention of the end of the world follow in short order. There are chases, narrow escapes and mysterious strangers; there are some surprises too, and the special effects (through gruesome, and heavily dependent upon insects) are remarkable.   Rent it; it's good fun.",8,0,0,14 May 2001
We Were Soldiers," A Good Movie; More Importantly- Historically Accurate
","A great criticism I have for current movies is that in an effort to be more marketable (or 'politically correct') actual events from history will be modified or distorted at the expense of the real people who were involved with the real events (last year's ridiculous 'historical' farce 'Pearl Harbor' springs to mind); there are enough genuine heros with true stories to tell.  Colonel Moore's in 'Were Were Soldiers' (based on his book 'We Were Soldiers Once, And Young') is one of these.   Before I continue, let me first say that I was a freshman in high school when the Paris Peace Treaty was signed in 1973, resulting in the withdrawal of all US troops from South Vietnam, and a junior when the North Vietnamese Army invaded and overran the unprotected South in 1975.  Since that time I have studied Indochinese history in great detail, and have earned Master's degrees in both Asian Studies (South and Southeast Asia concentration) and International Affairs from the University of Michigan and Columbia University.   The movie itself is well photographed and exhibits great expertise with battlefield verisimilitude and special effects.  More importantly, the film for the most part leaves political issues aside and tries to show us what Moore and his troops experienced those November days in 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley, and like it or not, whatever your opinions may be on US involvement in Vietnam, Moore's small, well trained force fought off and defeated far larger number of North Vietnamese Regulars in what was the first head-to-head combat between American and the invading Vietnamese Communist forces.  That's what happened.   The North Vietnamese had hoped to inflict a large amount of casualties to alter American public opinion (which was very much in favor of the introduction of US troops).  The surrounded US troops used artillery and air support to repel the attackers, and killed more than 1800 NVA troops (total US battle deaths were around 300, including part of the later battle not shown in the film).  That's what happened.   What was very significant about this battle was that it convinced the North Vietnamese generals to never meet American troops ever again in a conventional battle situation on that scale, (and they didn't). It convinced the US strategists that the way to beat the North Vietnamese (and their South Vietnamese Viet Cong proxies) was to try to lure large units into battle using American ground forces as bait, so that artillery and air power could be brought to bear and inflict unacceptable casualties, diminishing the North's ability and ardor for occupying the South.  This strategy (known as 'attrition') did not work; the North Vietnamese stayed away from large unit action (as mentioned above) and they also did not care how many soldiers they lost; it's well known that there are 58,000 names of US war dead on the monument in Washington, DC, but the North Vietnamese war dead number two million by their own estimates.   'We Were Soldiers' is not entirely free of anachronistic 2001-era moral pronouncements, however, as the scene referring to a racist 'White Only' sign in a laundramat mentioned by an innocent officer's wife back at the base who thought it referred to the color of the fabrics permitted in the machines.  Had the scene ended with awkward looks, with the Black officer's wife present, it would have been a powerful moment.  The politically correct indignant speechifying, followed by the Black woman's pained, but Oh-so-noble reply was clumsy and dumb (discrimination against Blacks in North Carolina in 1965?! Imagine that!  Were these officer's wives supposed to be unaware of American history or the Civil Rights movement going on all around them?).  Some of the early scenes with Mel Gibson as the loving Daddy were a bit heavy handed too, I thought ('Daddy, what's a war?' asks his daughter who could be type-cast for Cindy-Lou Who).  The movie goes out of it's way to be even-handed in its depiction of the North Vietnamese, and goes a little too far, in my opinion, but there is no denying that they were well trained, well disciplined and courageous in battle.  The real slaughter of that war was suffered by the South Vietnamese civilians at the hands of the NVA and Viet Cong, however, and most of whose commanders were apparently not as introspective as the defeated officer shown here.   All in all standing alone as a movie it is bit gory, but exciting and entertaining.  As a 'war movie' it is essentially accurate, and without the tiresome left-wing political overtones of 'Platoon' 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'Apocalypse Now'.  Too many people just don't know the real history of that time and place, but that November in 1965, that's what really happened.",8,1,2,15 March 2002
Lost in Translation," The (Japanese) Emperor's New Clothes
","This film falls into the category I call 'Emperor's New Clothes' (ENC), as it has achieved fame and accolades for 'deep meaning' and 'sensitivity' but really is a two hour film about two boring, unhappy people who meet in a foreign county in which they don't speak the language.  That's pretty much it, and there's not much too 'deep' in flogging the limited cinematic possibilities offered by the premises that some Japanese people don't speak English, that some Japanese people speak English (and sing kareoke) with a heavy accent, and that some parts of Japanese popular culture may be different from what Americans might enjoy. As an American I have often found it amusing that some Europeans who frequent the IMBD boards take great umbrage at perceived slights (real and imagined) inflicted upon their national honor, history and integrity by ostensibly 'American' film makers and screenwriters.  In some cases it may even be justified.  There is no excuse for this movie's outright mockery of the Japanese, however, and it is astonishing to me that this insulting vapid waste of time- a two hour tribute to nothing but Sofia's attempt to reimagine her marriage to Spike, and the time she wasted hanging around Tokyo hotel suites-  is somehow being hailed as great storytelling, or great anything. The Japanese whiskey company can pay fading action movie star Bill Murray $2 million to endorse its product, but cannot afford to pay for a competent translator for filming the commercial?  A wig magically appears (and just as magically disappears) when young Scarlett is singing kareoke.  Bill Murray plays, well Bill Murray, doing his SNL lounge singer character.  The final climactic moment of the movie is a whisper not shared with the audience.  Is this writing or in fact the absence of writing? Scarlett's song is one made famous by the Pretenders; how fitting indeed: The Emperor has no clothes! The movie features",5,1,3,18 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Clowns
","With this dreadful installment the Star Wars franchise has succeeded in becoming a parody of itself, sinking under leaden exposition, bad casting, worse acting and overcomplicated soap opera plotlines, drifting lamely from scene to scene, punctuated occasionally by some noteworthy special effects. The whole notion is somewhat absurd; we already know what will happen, so what is the point of these 'prequals'?  Simply to sell more plastic dolls and pajamas?  The spontaneous thrills and excitement of the first Star Wars was never equalled, but the second and third installments were good enough. Attempting to repeat that magic with new casts in new movies set in the past (again, filling out a history we all know, and apparently better off in viewers' imaginations) is indeed a fool's errand, and obviously those associated with these productions live up to this billing admirably. Please, no more- make it stop!",3,0,1,19 November 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," A Pathetic Loser and Her Pathetic Life
","An unambitious, lazy and coarse woman of decidedly loose morals who drinks and smokes too much, is irresponsible and inept at work, and sadly (and drunkenly) warbles sentimental songs ('All By Myself') between slugs of vodka alone in her apartment has not managed to find someone who would like to be her boyfriend.  What a surprise.   We are supposed to perceive of 30-something Bridget Jones (Renee Z.) as a sympathetic character; (the audiences are predominantly female, and presumably are commiserating).  What I saw instead was a foul mouthed lout and obtuse loser who, despite promises to the eponymous diary, made no real effort to address the deficiencies she herself fully recognized.   Working at a publishing house in London, she responds to the lewd e-mailed suggestions of her boss, played by Hugh Grant (the caddish snake with a proper British accent is a slight variation on his usual character, but one he does well).  Although she seems to know he is up to no good, she happily proceeds, merely setting herself up for humiliation and disappointment (the two common occurrences which provide the 'humor' of this movie).  The alternative with whom she is presented is a stodgy (divorced) lawyer whom she ostensibly knew as a child, but seems to have been raised in a manor house on an estate some distance away, contradicting a central theme of the story, which is that (according to her mother who is trying to set them up) she romped naked as a four year old in his wading pool (he was eight at the time).   The representation of middle class life in London for a young single person is interesting, as it was in 'Notting Hill', but it was also noteworthy that the two significant incidences of potential calamity had their origins in 'New York' (interestingly the home office not only of her publishing firm, but of the lawyer's firm as well).   Most people have some vices, bad habits or other imperfections.  Bridget has these, but precious little else.  Her troubles are those caused solely by herself and her actions (or inactions).  The story laboriously drags itself to its clearly telegraphed 'happy' conclusion, but we are left wondering, why?     Midway through the movie, after cataloging a list of faults, the lawyer and potential suiter somewhat inexplicably states '... but I like you'. That's more than I can say for Bridget, or the movie.  If your girlfriend (or date) insists, then go, but otherwise stay away!",6,0,0,15 May 2001
Armageddon," This is actually three different movies- all bad.
","It's a disaster movie- can they drill the hole in time to save the Earth?(you know the answer); it's a space movie (Hey look- no gravity!) and it's a Daddy's little girl is all grown up and wants to marry Dad's well intentioned but failure of a protege who only needs a chance to prove himself! movie.  Predictable and insipid, the plot never really makes the case as to why a collection of uncouth-but-lovable wildcat oilwell drillers are somehow the only ones who can drill a tunnel in an asteroid so that a bomb can blow it apart before it destroys the world. We've seen the goof-balls at NASA training done better in that Simpsons episode- and that's the highlight of this turgid, self-important mess.",4,0,1,8 January 1999
The Patriot," According to this banal collection of movie standards, it was Mel Gibson, not George Washington.
","The Patriot is well filmed, but in the end it's just a 'politically corrected' amalgamation of well-worn and painfully predictable Hollywood stereotypes and storylines, with scenes and plot 'twists' lifted directly out of movies we have all seen a thousand times.  (There is a certain verisimilitude, though, imparted to the 18th Century battles scenes reminicent of the same type of 'reality' that was brought to the D-Day landing segment of 'Saving Private Ryan', and for this one can really gain some appreciation for what American soldiers went through during the Revolutionary War; I suspect, however,  that the true reason for this was the film makers' desire to show people's limbs being separated from their bodies by 12 pound cannonballs).So here we have Mel Gibson as a South Carolina plantation owner, widower, and loving father to seven children: a well know 'bad-ass' from his exploits during the French and Indian War (1754-63), Southern aristocrat Gibson now does not believe in violence, and wishes only to farm in peace. (This brings to mind the Clint Eastwood character in 'The Outlaw Josey Wales', who joins with the rebels only after his family is murdered and his farmstead burned by marauding Union troops). Gibson's politically correct plantation has no slaves, remarkably enough, but families of African-Americans happily working there of their own volition, as we are duly informed; the African-American woman who is the housekeeper and cook speaks perfect 20th Century English, and apparently can read too, since she casually examines the mail dropped off by a rider in the opening scene.  Actually, Gibson himself has no Southern accent, though some of his neighbors do.At this point the evil English officer is introduced to the movie, who promptly and cooly shoots Mel's 15 year old son to set the plot into motion. His character is identical to the English villain in 'Rob Roy', or the Sheriff of Nottingham from Robin Hood, for that matter: the upper class accented heartless butcher, seeking to compensate for his own wretchedness and unhappiness.  Forced into action, and to return to violence, Gibson's character confesses to the atrocities he and his collegues visited upon the French during the previous war.  In previous generations a military hero would have been shown in a psoitive light; for PC Hollywood today, however, the hero's exploits are now to be reviled as sadistic and murderous: his victory is not one of courage and tactics, but of torturing captured French soldiers (who had themselves committed heinois acts).So the movie lurches on from battle to battle in predictable sequence. Some of these scenes, and indeed the climactic battle scene, seem to be directed lifted from 'Braveheart', although with weapony slightly more advanced: hordes of men yelling and charging on broad fields with Mel in the thick of it.  Along the way the British are turned into SS troopers, more happy African-Americans are found living in African harmony somewhere near the coast (presumably of South Carolina) but speaking without the slightest trace of Southern, or African-American dialects or accents.  (A boorish white soldier in Gibson's command who scorned the black slave enlisted by his owner in Gibson's militia of course is later saved by him, and solemnly proclaims that he is 'honored' to serve with him, lest any in the audience have missed this message).George Washington and the Continental Army get pretty short shrift in Gibson's war, but in the pivotal battle, conveniently just before Yorktown (where the British surrendered) Gibson rallies the troops 'round the flag when the lines are faltering (just before finding and facing his nemisis among the 30,000 or so present on the battlefield)and siezes victory from the jaws of defeat- the Revolution is saved, and America is born! (Not before the 'we've-seen-this-at-least-a-thousand-times-before' fight to the finish between Gibson and the evil British officer who murdered his son(s).This scene comes directly from 'Rob Roy' in its choreography).This movie unnecessarily demonizes the English, plays havoc with history to effect its Hollywood PC messages, disparages the accomplishments of American revolutionary soldiers and layers on tired diagloge, plot devices and sermonizing for any who have missed their ham-handed point of view.  As history it's a joke.  As a 'patriotic' American film, it's disingenuous. As entertainment, it's only passable (barely).  It is not absolutely horrible, but that's really the best thing I can say about it, and that's rather sad.",Null,6,14,19 February 2001
Spider-Man," Best Film of 2002
","'Spiderman' was easily the best (i.e. most enjoyable) film of the year, with a good story, good character development and state-of-the-art special effects.  OK, the Green Goblin outfit was a bit hokey and the movie was a wee bit slow in parts, but the scenes of New York were surprisingly authentic (I liked the attention to detail, such as the small Columbia University pennant in Peter's apartment) and the story was just plain good, old-fashioned excitement, and fun.  See it (again)!",9,0,1,19 November 2002
54," Weak and Disjointed
","The story of Steve Rubel and of Studio 54 (the famous night spot of the elite on New York's 54th Street in an old ABC TV studio) is a facinating one which encapsulates much of the atmosphere of excess which characterized that era; this movie, '54' which purports to tell that story through the eyes of Shane, one of Rubel's employees, fails miserably in its attempt.  What we get instead is Reese Witherspoon's husband presented as a shiftless but handsome youth from Jersey City (a working class town directly across the Hudson River) yearning for the excitment of the 'Big City' in a banal 'Cinderella' tale.Mike Myers is brilliant as Steve Rubel, the club's creator, a drug swilling homosexual who likes to surround himself with pretty boys. Enter Mr. Witherspoon's 'Shane' who catches Rubel's eye while trying to gain admittance one night into the fabled lair of the famous. Through some oblique family connection Shane is introduced to Rubel, and is offered a job as a busboy. So far, so good.At this point the film loses direction (perhaps literally) as instead of learning the secrets of what went on in the club- facinating bits about basement VIP rooms and drug pipelines only alluded to in passing, we are instead served up a lame story of Shane's attraction for a famous TV star and (Neve Campbell) who frequents the club, and an entngled relationship with Shane's fellow busboy's pretty wife (Miss Hayuk).Out of nowhere Shane is suddenly driving a Camero with custom plates and living the high life, but inexplicably is still living in a small apartment with his two fellow employees- and by the way, how a busboy and hatcheck girl could afford a two bedroom apartment in the City is just another careless detail in this sloppy mess.As many other have said, 'Boogie Nights' does a much better job of conveying the mood and music of the period, and also tells a more interesting story of the characters involved, in frankly a very similar story.There was a good story to be told here, but we never can get past the door.",6,1,3,20 January 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Clooney's Ego
","The original 'Ocean's 11' (1960) famously starred Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin and several other well-known stars of the era.  The so-called 'Rat Pack' were friends and the movie, a quickly slapped together story involving robbing the vaults of several Las Vegas casinos, was as much a lark for them as the movie-going audience.  The modern version shamelessly appropriates the title and plot of the original film, but completely misses the point, and several major components of the first version, settling instead to be a vanity piece for the smirking but boring Mr. Clooney and company.In 1960 Las Vegas was a relatively new venue, which had erupted from the desert in what was still a very undeveloped and rustic Nevada.  World War II had ended only 15 years before, and the United States was going through a period of tremendous economic growth and optimism.  The original Danny Ocean (Mr. Sinatra) and his crew had all served during the war together in the 82nd Airborne Division, and therefore were trained commandoes, and very used to working as a team.  The concept of the movie is that this team of commadoes uses their wartime skills to plan and carry-out an elaborate scheme to simultaneously rob the vaults of the adjacent casinos on the strip in Las Vegas.  In the original, the plan moves smoothly, until a very unexpected development deprives them of their ill-gotten gains.  They leave, satisfied that their plan worked, and that the widow of one of their team is provided for, but otherwise none the richer for the criminal activities.The Clooney fantasy is unencumbered by any such notions of plot or message; it's simply all about George and the assembled well-known Hollywood faces recruited to mimic the style of the original, which include Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon.  Not war heros and comrades who are used to putting their lives in eachothers' hands, but simply an amalgamation of two bit hoods and convenient 'experts' with apparently limitless funding from a sympathetic gangster (a premise also borrowed from the original)Clooney- himself a small-time robber just out of jail- smugly stumbles his way through the exposition as though this was some type of 'Mission Impossible' TV show setup.Ridiculous, inane and outright dopey, the updated 'Ocean's 11' sails along through frantic attempts at clever plot twists and the bad guys make off with the loot, and handsome George seems to be on track to win back his former wife, Julia Roberts.  Guess what? Crime does pay!  Apparently so in this case of stolen ideas and smug self-congratulatory celebrity. Montsrously enough, there are rumors of a sequel.  What's next? Clooney re-recording 'New York, New York'?",5,0,1,22 January 2003
Hellboy," Heavy on Effects, But Not Very Special
","As with many of my fellow viewers here at IMDb, I at first had no interest in seeing this obscure comic book figure's cinematic debut, but preliminary favorable reviews and commentary found me pushing my $6.50 across the counter for the Sunday matinee viewing of 'Hellboy'.  It was not $6.50 well spent. Arcane as the character and story of 'Hellboy' are, the film itself is disturbingly reminiscent of at least a dozen other (and better) movies.  It isn't that the idea of an oversized, wisecracking demon, adopted and raised from infancy by the OSS in 1944, battling evil on the side of Righteousness is not without originality or merit, but we have pretty much seen everything before; a sinister Nazi plot to use supernatural powers to aid their nefarious cause ('Raiders of the Lost Ark'); top secret government offices and agencies to deal with phenomena kept hidden from the populace, yet operating under our very noses ('Men in Black'); special groups of creatures, i.e. misfits,  with outlandish powers in hidden academies, led by benevolent elderly gentlemen ('The X-Men', 'League of Extraordinary Men'); battles with slimy monsters living in abandoned tunnels in New York City ('Ghost Busters', among others); a girl with pyrokinetic powers ('Firestarter') and so on, and on and on...It begins promisingly enough, but soon bogs down under its own weight with recondite references to biblical demonology, and increasingly bizarre (and apparently immortal) enemies.  The fight scenes are violent, but dark and difficult to follow, as is the climax, which is held in a huge and elaborate underground vault looming beneath a cemetery near Moscow and outfitted with giant hammers with no other apparent purpose than to smash a bridge (don't ask).  Perhaps the comic book saga explains these things in greater detail, but in an hour an a half, the uninitiated general viewer just gets lost (and bored). The new government agent selected to chaparone Hellboy brings remarkably little to the film.  This is a role which might have been played by Keanu Reeves or even Matthew Broderick with some greater success, but here just plods along as the script directs. There is a fellow made of sand who winds himself up like a watch, an esp accoutered aquatic being with the voice of Niles Crane named for Abraham Lincoln, a beautiful Nazi woman named Ilsa who does not age after 60 years, and of course the Czarist priest Rasptutin plays a major role in the proceedings. None of it makes much sense, but then again, that could be a good thing...",7,1,3,19 April 2004
Moulin Rouge!," Three Movies in One: All of them Bad
","The Moulin Rouge is a theater in Paris known for its elaborate and and somewhat racy shows, now a favorite for tourists visiting the city (I myself have fallen into that category).  With all of the media attention bestowed on this project because of Nicole Kidman, and the fact that this was a musical, I was curious to see how it had turned out (plus my girlfriend wanted to go).The film begins quite promisingly, with an elaborate computer generation of Paris in 1899, including some whimsical touches, showing very interestingly the area of Paris in which the Moulin Rouge ('Red Windmill' in English) is found.  I was reminded immediately of Tim Burton's work, with the attention to detail, and slightly surrealistic atmosphere; (I was also reminded of Disney's 'Mary Poppins' with its rooftops of London scenes). This alone makes the movie worth seeing (well, almost).The movie starts out cheerfully, and somewhat goofily, in a good natured way, to introduce the protagonist, an aspiring writer on sojourn from London.  When he begins to sing 'The Hills are Alive (With the Sound of Music)' as suggested lyrics for a show on which his bohemian upstairs neighbors are laboring to produce for the proprietor the Moulin Rouge, the movie takes a turn into what I thought was parody, but sadly, was a harbinger of what to expect for the next two hours.Nicole Kidman is a prostitute employed by the moulin Rouge as a singer, but she refers to herself (and her occupation) by the more noble sound epithet of 'courtesan'.  This may elevate in some way her status in the film, but unfortunately for her, it does nothing to help her singing, which is generally on the level of a medium sized high school musical.  Editing techniques vary from styles lifted directly from the (very) old 1960's TV show The Monkees' to the frenetic MTV music video genre.  All of this is pasted onto a very tired old plot about star-crossed lovers and a buffoonish wealthy rival for Miss Kidman's affections. Anachronistic uses of modern songs become jarring, like some Saturday Night Live skit that drags on and on; (some in the audience laughed heartily, blissfully unaware that it wasn't supposed to be funny).By the film's end, it is nothing more than a poorly scored and overbloated opera, or Shakespearean tragedy.",2,11,19,9 June 2001
Black Hawk Down," A Lot of Action, But Where's the Context?
","'Blackhawk Down' has now been the top grossing film in the USA for the past three weeks.  Quite apparently there are themes, or visualizations which resonate with the American population, as our troops are in action at this moment in Afghanistan.  Absent the very real daily heroics in Southwest Asia reported in newspapers and on television to the US population, I do not think Blakhawk Down would have been so successful.  It is a well-made movie which strives for (and succeeds in) authenticity, but it is not, in my opinion a 'great movie' or would stand as such on its own in different circumstances.I think that for Americans, (including myself), and particularly in light of the military tactics employed with such success against the Taliban forces in Afghanistan, the frustration of watching the dire situation of the Army Rangers and Special Operations soldiers stranded and surrounded after the ambush is exacerbated by the knowledge that what was done in Khandahar this Winter could just as easily been done in Mogadishu ten years ago .  This is a major part of the story which is essentially ignored by the movie.  Another is any real mention of the planning and motivation of the 'warlord' forces who ambushed the US troops and were trying to kill them.  A lengthy synopsis of the history of African politics or essay on international affairs may not be not necessary, but some type of context is needed as we watch the firefights and carnage.A perfunctory set-up of the situation in Somalia is given at the beginning of the film.  There is some attempt to explore the military culture of the US soldiers, but this too is far too abbreviated; some distinction is made between Rangers and the Delta force personnel, but no explanation is forthcoming.  (Why could a Delta Sergeant speak so dismissively to a Ranger Colonel in the mess line?).  The fact that the Army Rangers are themselves a very elite unit is not emphasized, and I do not think the general public (even one now following the news from Afghanistan) knows the real distinctions between regular soldiers, airborne soldiers, airborne Rangers and Special Forces.  The point is that these men represented the very best of the US Army in terms of training and motivation.  The Delta personnel, the absolute best of the best, consider themselves answerable to none but their own (also shown later in the film).As I mentioned, no effort is made to illuminate the thinking of the Americans' antagonists or to explain their actions.  In fact, the Somalis in question had studied Rangers rappelling down from Blackhawk helicopters, and so knew when best to strike.  The US raiding party was ambushed, and then cut off, while efforts were made to extract them.  This is the heart of the movie, and it is done very well: pinned down, the US soldiers, vastly outnumbered and outgunned, try to cope with their situation and await rescue while surrounded by heavily armed 'militia' indistinguishable from the general population.  Unlike many movies, the heroics shown were quite real: it really did happen that way (there is a Documentary on the ambush now on the History Channel).  Why, however, was this ambush undertaken by the Somalis?  What did they hope to gain?  Why was a prisoner taken and later released?  What was the reaction of the rest of the population?
For an American viewer, other questions pose themselves more urgently: Where were the fighter-bombers?  Where were the Cobra gunships?  Where were the US reinforcements?  President Clinton had been quite specific in limiting the American military presence, completely ignoring the manpower and equipment requirements stipulated by the officers in charge of the Somalia expedition. There were no US forces, or adequate airpower or armor to face that contingency (which the Somalis knew).  This deserved some mention or explanation in the film (but then again, Hollywood loves Slick Willy and won't do him wrong).  The ignominious withdrawl of the US troops after the ambush ordered by Clinton was a major factor in the renewed interest in attacking Americans and American interests on the part of adversaries around the globe, strengthening the belief that American casualties will end any American international involvement- a belief quoted very enthusiastically recently by those espousing a 'holy war' against the US.We see what happened, but we don't know why. In the end, 'Blackhawk Down' provides an interesting vignette of soldiers in action, and is horrifying realistic in its portrayal of the gore of combat, but raises far more questions then it answers, and these are answers that the movie's viewers deserve to be told.",8,0,0,4 February 2002
Big Fish," A Bit Too Tall of a Tale
","'Big Fish' as directed by Tim Burton pays lavish attention to detail, and that alone makes for this to be an enjoyable and entertaining film viewing experience.  The renderings of the fantastic tales of the elder Mr. Bloom are very visually rewarding and interesting, and the plot-line of the son's reconciliation with the dying father (and all of those tall tales) is a reasonable enough framework on which to have constructed the movie.  In all that detail and elaborate storytelling, however, some elaborate threads are left dangling, some storylines seem to have been changed mid-movie and some, briefly alluded to, and left sadly unexplored. These deficiencies do not prevent the film from being sentimental fun, creatively satisfying and well worth seeing, but nonetheless hold it short of attaining the distinction of a 'great' movie.  There is enough symbolism and allusions to previous movies (his own and others)to keep film students and movie buffs busy analyzing and debating for years, but maybe Mr. Burton should have kept his eye more on the actual telling of the storyteller's story, rather than on constructing some of the perhaps too clever asides.  I hate to say it, but there's just something fishy about that.",8,0,1,16 January 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Some Things Are Meant To Be
","There is none of the usual Jim Carey slapstick or goofy noises and faces, but instead a surprisingly thoughtful, complex and thought provoking story. There have been several movies at least that I can recall which deal with the subject of erasing and/or replacing memories which are unpleasant or painful (I think Ben Affleck had one earlier this year, that no one seems to remember- hey it really works!).  They usually involve spotless labs and sinister technicians in white coats.  In this well spun take, the memory erasers (by design) behave more like the dolts who come over to connect your cable television from Verizon. There is some interesting play with flashbacks and Carey's character's attempts to defeat the memory erasure for which he had contracted to remove thoughts of a failed relationship (with Kate Winslet) while it is in progress. As the viewer sorts out the chronology of the film as it unfolds, and the effects of the various inter-related subplots with the small cast of characters you are drawn closer into the story, and the impending outcome. The movie is set in the present, and the troubled relationship is depicted as very real, and actually very troubled, but that in itself is quite realistic.  This is not a 'Hollywood' love story, (although in a larger sense, perhaps it is, in a more modern and updated version). It will make you think, and maybe make you smile.  Who knows?; You may have even seen it already...",8,0,1,19 March 2004
Mystic River," Great Movie? I Am Mystified!
","With Academy Awards for Sean Penn and Tim Robbins for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, there can be little doubt about the high quality of performances by the cast of 'Mystic River'.  With Clint Eastwood as the Director, attracting a cast of all-stars, which also included Kevin Bacon and Samuel L. Jackson, the mechanics and technical aspects of the film itself are all first class, the weakness, however- and it is a significant weakness- comes in the plot and storyline, neither of which meets up with the high levels of this undertaking. Most people reading this already know the details of the story, and so I will not repeat them here.  I will say that 'Mystic River' reminded me very much of a Clint Eastwood movie from 1978 called 'Tightrope' in which he played a Police Detective in New Orleans on the trail of a serial killer. Circumstantial evidence is built up through the film pointing to the distinct possibility that the Eastwood character himself may be the actual murderer, making for some intriguing possibilities. {Possible Spoiler Ahead} At the end of the movie, however, when the killer is revealed, the audience feels cheated as the murdered turns out to be some random minor character barely mentioned in the story, with a lame motive for his actions sloppily tacked on.  Hmmmmmmm.  Ironically, Kevin Bacon appeared in the 1996 film 'Sleepers' which dealt with grown men attempting to come to terms with sexual molestation endured while in juvenile detention in the early 70's, and also played a character named Sean.  Hmmmmmmm. 'Mystic River' touches on the three boyhood friends, and the tragic circumstances which ostensibly led to the dissolution of their friendship, but the movie is not about Tim Robbin's character's struggle to come to terms with his horrific experience.  At least, most of it isn't.  It actually cannot seem to decide what it is. A lot of the movie is a standard TV police show investigation, except that Bacon and his partner Jackson don't bother to compare the DNA of the potentially incriminating blood stains found in a suspect's car, with that of Sean Penn's murdered daughter. That might have cleared some questions up pretty quickly. (Doesn't Clint ever watch CSI?  Forensic technology has changed quite a bit from Dirty Harry's days in San Francisco in 1968, though you'd never know it from this movie). Penn was quite good as the neighborhood tough still in the crime game, though he seemed to be channeling Robert DiNero at times.  Bacon played his standard take on the police investigator, and Jackson's African-American character must have been named 'Whitey Powers' as some type of joke. Robbins deserved his Oscar for the performance of the tortured soul, but the cheap ending, complete with Bacon giving the hand pistol shooting sign to Penn (a la Charles Bronson at the end of 'Death Wish') and the glaring unfinished business and looses ends finds one watching the final credits roll with a 'Hmmmmm'.",7,0,0,2 March 2004
Enemy at the Gates," A Good War Story Without Revisionist History Lessons
","As a movie alone 'Enemy at the Gates' is well worth seeing, as a 'war movie' or as a piece of historical insight into a crucial part of World War II, seeing it is an absolute necessity.  More than that, it is worth seeing simply because it is a movie with a plot, characters and story to tell, unlike many of the big-budget, high-tech, special effects failures foisted upon on a weary movie-going public this summer.  Springing to mind is 'Pearl Harbor', which by most accounts is a lame love story crudely and gratuitously cloned on to a pivitol part of American, and World history. (After I read that Disney Studios toned down that film in deference to the potential Japanese and Germans audiences, trading potential foreign sales dollars for veracity and integrity, I decided never to spend a penny on it myself).   'Pearl Harbor' is pertinent here because 'Enemy at the Gates' also uses some very impressive special effects to depict realistic combat (which we all first saw in 'Saving Private Ryan').  The horror of Stalingrad, the August '43- February '43 battle in which the story takes place, is remarkably brought to the screen, and the miserable conditions of both the Russian and German soldiers armies are shown, a detail worth noting: the Battle of Stalingrad represented the first loss by Hitler's Nazi forces, and the victory helped to inspire the Russians to begin their hard fought march to Berlin (culminating in April of 1945).  To put things in perspective, the Russians lost between 500,000 and one million killed in action during this fight, and the Germans about 150,000 dead; (of the 91,000 Germans who surrendered on January 31st, 1943, only 6,000 ever made it back to Germany after the war).  Compare these figures with the 300,000 total Americans killed in both Europe and the Pacific in World War II, or the 58,000 killed in Vietnam from 1963 to 1975.  Stalingrad has almost religious meaning for the Russians (and the opposite for the Germans, would would have conquered Russia if this fight had been won).   The story of the movie is of a Russian farm boy thrust into a major propaganda role by a Communist operative looking out for his own advancement as much as that of the Glorious Red Army.  The operative had witnessed a sharpshooting display by this unassuming new recruit and realizes that tales of this simple shepherd fighting for the Fatherland would be a potent motivator for soldiers as well as the home front (the sharpshooter did, in fact exist).  As the exploits of the new Hero are reported by the Soviet propaganda machine, the Germans learn of him, and decide to send their own top sniper to crush this rekindling of Russian fighting spirit.  The second half of the movie follows their personal war, and its conclusion and although slow going at times, is still interesting.   The actors all comport themselves well: the hero is Jude Law (the rich boy in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'), the Communist Party operative who makes him a hero is the guy from 'Shakespeare in Love', the pretty Russian Jewish girl who comes to play a big part in the relationship between the hero and his lobbyist is the female lead from the 'Mummy' movies.  many other people have commented on the use of accents in the film.  The Russians speak with English accents, but I think this is just a device to show a) they are foreign and b) the class distinctions between them (the hero has a low class accent, the Jewish intellectual a high class accent).  To have had them speaking in corresponding American accents would have been distracting. Also distracting would have been fake sounding 'German' and 'Russian' accents if employed by the cast.   Most viewers will be surprised by the brutality and cruelty shown by the Communists towards their own people.  This was very accurate.  The fact that the Germans (although certain atrocities are mentioned) are not shown as evil caricatures (like the British Commander in 'The Patriot') is also positive for the overall story.  The heros nemesis, (played by Ed Harris), is shown as a high born and high ranking German thoughtful and cunning, as well as cruel, when necessary (he is, after all a sniper).  Heavy handed moralizing or messages do not get in the way of the character development or the story. (It is an interesting situation for an American to watch Germans and Russians fighting as a detached third party).   In short, it's a good story, and an interesting look at an important piece of history without minimal Hollywood-style revisionism.  See it!",9,0,2,17 August 2001
Love Actually," Quite Good, Actually
","This fairly-tale land of upper-class London has by now become a friendly and familiar venue to American viewers of such movies as 'Notting Hill', 'Bridgit Jones' Diary' and 'About a Boy' (all featuring Hugh Grant in simple variations of his one character, as a matter of fact).  The pervasive nature of American Culture in the very fabric of British life is quite an interesting phenomenon, and it plays quite a significant role in 'Love, Actually', though perhaps without intending to. 'Love, Actually' is a series of vingnettes strung together about a dozen or so characters whose lives are somehow all connected, which makes for easy transitions from the individual characters and their separate stories.  It is quite entertaining, and sometimes touching, though sometimes also very familiar from previous films of the genre (a climactic scene at an English school student production, for example). America features quite prominently directly as well as indirectly, which may explain a rather awkward and unnecessary scene in which Hugh Grant (as the Prime Minister of England) loudly proclaims Britain's independence from the United States of America, to the apparent adulation of his staff, and the British public.  I am unaware of the English feeling repressed by the US, but the scene struck me as one of those contrived sequences in 'The West Wing' (an American TV show alluded to in the movie, ironically) in which the Left-Wing script writers have a character spout off about some pet issue-of-the-week (gun control, global warming, ad nauseum) to put everything right in their fantasy world where Martin Sheen is President, and the Democrats always win.  This American President (played by Billy Bob Thornton) is a leering, smug Bill Clinton-like weasel whom Grant's character spots hitting on the housemaid to whom Grant himself has taken a fancy; British international policy thus dictated by the hurt feelings of an English PM, who puts America promptly and coldly in its place at a Press Conference, while Thornton looks on in surprise and dismay. America is described as a land of opportunity (of a certain sort) for a buffoonish would-be casannova who flies to Milwaukee, lands up in a random bar, and has all of his dreams remarkably come true (as in a beer commercial).  It's quite funny, but also rather a meanspirited swipe at the women of America's heartland.  A little boy pines for a classmate, who will soon be returning home to (guess where?) and one of the main characters is herself apparently American (and doomed to one of the only segments without a happy ending).  Movies, music expressions and customs all imported from West of the Atlantic punctuate and permeate the film; and of course, most of the film's profits will be generated from the spending of American movie goers. Politics and sociology aside, 'Love Actually' is really a rather entertaining and pleasant film.  The segments dealing with the two characters who are stand-ins for the lighting and staging of a pornographic film have elicited many comments from other viewers, but the innocence of their burgeoning romance, juxtaposed with their increasingly intimate postures was also clever. It's really worth seeing, actually.",8,0,2,11 November 2003
The Sixth Sense," A very good, and well told story.
","The most arresting aspect of this movie for me was the portrayal of the troubled little boy.  The methods he devised of dealing with his apparent ability to 'see dead people' (i.e. the 'sixth sense') and his heartwrenching difficulties with his mother, classmates, and the troubled spirits themselves are excellently portrayed and presented.  He is an unusually good actor, particularly for one so young.   Bruce Willis is quite good in his role of the Child Psychologist attempting to help the ostensibly delusional and psychotic child.  The spooky effects are good, and not overdone with gore or crude bloodshed.  In fact, the movie really makes one think about the proximity of the 'spirit world'- especially on a dark night when alone.   Many viewers who have offered comments here have seen the movie more than once.  I think I will too.  It is an entertaining, well thought out, well performed and expertly and effectively shot film.   Rent it next Halloween!",9,1,1,28 May 2000
The Thin Red Line," Possibly the very worst movie I have ever seen.
","Trying to tag along with the popularity of Saving Private Ryan, a far superior film which deals with American soldiers in Europe in World War II, The Thin Red Line's advertising attempts to present this as a war movie about US soldiers in the Pacific theater (Guadalcanal- a turning point in the war against the Japanese).  The actual war takes up about 10% of this overly long, completely boring and utterly inane piece of garbage.  The rest of the movie is devoted to scenes dedicated to brooding soldiers; moronic voiceovers over what appears to be spare National Geographic documentary footage of the rain forest; abstruse philosophic ruminations which make this more of a series of disjointed monologues seemingly edited by first year film students; and just about every cliche of dying soldiers in agony. During the actual Battle for Guadalcanal US forces won a hard fought victory against fanatically dedicated and courageous Imperial Japanese troops defending an important airfield.  One would wonder how any American soldiers accomplished anything based on this movie's relentless characterizations of American soldiers as terrified and reluctant, ill-lead and confused.  There are banal references to incompetent officers (Nick Nolte), gratuitous but meaningless scenes with big-name actors which contribute nothing to this horrendus jumble (John Travolta, George Clooney) and Sean Penn essentially reprising his role as a Sergeant from that Vietnam movie with Michael J. Fox.  The movie is interspersed with scenes of happy aboriginal natives, and bizarre 'art school' flashbacks and stream of consciousness ramblings.  I suppose this is supposed to stand in contrast to the war, but it simply looks like three different movies edited together in a blender. This movie is a disgrace, an insult to US veterans and a comlpete waste of time.  It was one of the few movies that I not only wanted to leave, but also ask for my money back.",1,9,18,17 January 1999
High Fidelity," Am I missing something?
","I don't know why some people are so enchanted by this movie. This film in generally rather depressing: a sad story of a loser, and the various losers with whom he surrounds himself.  The humor purports to find beginnings in a failed relationship between the Cuzack character (the owner of a record store in a fringe neighborhood of Chicago(?) and the most recent of his girlfriends, and the antics of the screwball 'employees' in his store. These last two characters were actually rather well written and clever.   There are several clever aspects to this movie, which was apparently written by people quite knowledgable about music, but it basically is about a selfish, immature loser who still somehow ends up with the girl, who upon any reflection whatsoever, is revealed as no great prize herself.  Why would anyone be interested in either of these two?   The movie itself is filmed in a quirky kind of style in which the main character speaks directly to the viewers (even furtively lowering his voice when others are nearby) and was shot in a quick-cut fashion reminiscent of a cough syrup commercial one might have seen on television and quickly forgot. The continuous smoking of the protagonist made me wonder if the movie was funded by a tobacco company, and made my eyes sting just watching.   It was essentially a depressing movie interspersed with some funny (but eminently predictable) moments.  (One clever remark: describing a sweater as 'So Cosby' in a movie featuring a former castmember in a small, but very noticeable role).   It's worth a look, particularly if you are interested in music, or John Cuzack, otherwise, keep on browsing the aisles of the video store...    By the way, how did he afford this store or paying his employees, with no customers?",Null,0,0,29 November 2000
