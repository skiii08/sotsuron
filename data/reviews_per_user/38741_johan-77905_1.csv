First Man," Beautifully done
","Lots of history I did not know. Gripping first person views. Not sure if Armstrong was as distant as Ryan portrays him? Well executed but missed reentry scenes from Apollo, some of the most famous pictures in history was that of the crew floating in the ocean victorious. Well done.",9,0,3,25 January 2019
