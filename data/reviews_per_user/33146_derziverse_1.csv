The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Great coming of age movie!!
","I absolutely loved this movie and it's characters, but some aspects of it were odd. Such as the dead friend of Charlie sure he writes to him sometimes in the movie and he mentions him when he is high. Other than that we only get flashbacks of his Aunt Helen which I get must be tragic. But if one of your best friends shoots himself and your left alone in high school wouldn't we see some sort of flashbacks or other mentions of it other than when he's high on pot and when he's writing to him? We never get to know the friend. Besides that it's a really touching movie and I would definitely recommend watching it if you're in high school. It also shows the many types of people you will meet in high school along with appealing to romance lovers such as myself. Very good watch.",9,0,1,20 November 2016
