Moneyball," engaging and thoroughly interesting, great film
","I truly found this movie to be engaging and thoroughly interesting all the way through. Knowing a lot about baseball and the era represented certainly helps. While it certainly can deliver for the non-baseball fan, a true die-hard will enjoy it the most as long as they can reconcile the exaggeration, Hollywood treatment and overselling of the concept (the Twins team that beat them spent nothing as well but they didn't crunch any OBA numbers themselves). Baseball facts aside, it's a well structured and well acted film. I love the overall message and final metaphor the film delivered.... know when you've done well (hit a home run) and take time to enjoy the moment and savor the experience.",9,1,2,4 October 2011
Captain America: Civil War," a thrilling treat for ALL film fans!
","This movie is honestly as good as any adventure film that I've ever seen. This isn't just a treat for Marvel fans or comic book fans, this is a treat for ALL film fans.I'm glad to see the response to Captain America Civil War has been very positive. I've noticed that sometimes expectations are unreasonable or some fans are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. Sure Cap stays close to the spirit of its root origins but the fact that people are judging it as a film first is great to see. Whatever the reason, it seems everyone enjoyed it as much as I did. Visually it is a sight to behold and that goes for the special effects but also for the cinematography and grit of the film itself. Every scene was captivating, whether it was full on action or the developmental down time. Isn't that what movies are suppose to be about?",10,14,30,29 April 2016
Thor," Bombastic!! Emotional depth, smart yet fun as can be!!
","This is a film that moves at lightning speed, (PUN INTENDED) egged on by Ken Branagh's bold direction. Thor takes its energy from character development and conflict. The well paced action and conflict scenes are like nothing you've ever seen before and that's saying something in this day and age.Thor has real emotional depth way beyond what you would expect. It also has action and special effects second to none. After a while and because of the turn in story, you don't really think about those amazing effects, and that's a good thing. Instead, you're pulled into a story about people and that's a great thing.I like this comicbook anti-hero fallen god. He's gritty, primal, vain yet noble and somehow more real. The film does a great job of showing us how an arrogant son can come to grips with who and what he truly is. The movie draws the audience in with its confidence and it never lets you go. There's no doubt that Natalie Portman was an important piece of casting because she brings the story down to earth. Thor meets Portman's Jane Foster after he is banished from the home of the gods to live among mortals. The audience can relate to what Jane is experiencing and it grounds the film perfectly. That makes the action seem more real and that's a tough balancing act. There are plenty of scenes that you have to see to believe! This movie actually has a heart and a soul and a brain and I couldn't have asked for anything more.I'd rather a movie be too cerebral then too dumb. This film succeeds on a basic level. It jumps the boundaries of its genre to pull in viewers with originality and inventiveness. Calling it a standard action film doesn't do it justice. It's surprisingly deep and takes the time to set itself up. A complete movie that really doesn't belong in the summer with the likes of the brainless films.",9,0,1,14 October 2011
