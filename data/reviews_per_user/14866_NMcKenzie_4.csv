Kill Bill: Vol. 2," liked vol I? get excited...didn't see it? rent it and see what it's all about..
","If you like the first one, then I don't really have to convince you, these two movies are a one-TWO, and they saved the best for last, that is if you have the ability to leave some of the reality at the door. I'm not saying they are stretch to the extent of 'The Matrix' or anything like that, but they are dont creatively to give a new spin on things old. What movie with a killing in it wasn't based upon revenge? But how many of those movies are as innovative and while some say 'that's stupid and unrealistic', well that's the point, you kill someone you go to jail in real life...it's a movie.... But back to the main point, if you didn't I commented on the first volume which recieved fair marks on here as well, but I think before you see the second that this second installment could not possibly be as good. Its defintely visually pleasing, and the sound is great (both effects and music). Along with that, it plays off some of the things in the first movie but gives the (note the quotes for modesty)'saga' more depth..ie the chapel massacre. In any case, I loved it and I think that I liked it more than the first one. To be fair I am biased and ran out and bought the first one; so, I suggest, rent the first volume, if you can't buy into it then dont waste your time on the second. However, if you liked it in the least, get excited for volume two because it is just a great ending to the story. Also, I have to note, I was incredibly impressed with the actor's, whose name I'm not sure of now, performance. I think that Uma Thurman was a good cast for the main role, but the casting of Bill's part couldn't have been better. At any rate, I hope that even though I didn't elaborate much on the plot, the fact that I am so excited about this movies gets SOME people out and turned on to the 'Kill Bill' stories.",10,1,2,17 April 2004
Van Helsing," Defintely see it while it's in theaters
","Don't have a huge critique planned, but I think an opinion is in order. First, I really liked seeing this movie, Hugh Jackman is awesome and needs to do more action flicks. There was constant action and though predictable at times, it was funny at times, made you jump once or twice, and was kate beckinsale is a full blown bombshell. Second, the problem I can see that people would have with it is there are unnecessary scenes, like the ending, no spoiler here, but it was a little drawn out. However, to those people I ask what would you have done to make those spots better? I can't really think of much, and I was impressed enough by the rest of the movie to where the little sratches were barely noticable. A huge problem is people forget this is a movie, because I am so sick of hearing 'it's unrealistic' or whatever. The point of a movie like this is you sorta check out at the door, and hold on for a ride. If you go see this movie you dont have to be a dummy while watching...but just go to be told a story and entertained, not taught a life lesson, or search for redeeming value. I hope you all love it as much as I did.",7,0,0,8 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," ...your name's buck.....and you're here to
","Yeah right, like they'd let me say that. I think that this is rightfully up in the top 250 movies ranked on this site. One of the most artistically filmed pieces produced since Memento, Mullholland Dr. Of course all in my humble opinion. Not sure if I should go through the plot because there is enough of it on here, but I wanted to point out certain things that appealed which support my vote for the 10. First, I'm not an anime fan at all, but I think the addition of the O-ren cartoon segment was genius, and it's a perfect example of why although not highly esteemed by all, tarantino is undoubtedly talented. With shots like the one of the sheriffs dashboard and all the glasses, the scenes/sets themselves (suburban house fight, O-rens snowy and indoor scenes), combined with such other tarantino (unorthadox to almost a arrogant/comical level-think of them as the new briefcase as in pulp fiction) icons as the pussywagon, and the 'deadly viper..blah blah insert catchy group name here.....squad' (that was sarcasm not their name, but i still got a laugh from the real name) you have to laugh at times as well as appreciate the creativity in every detail. Oh  yeah and one more thing, how could I forget, guys you have to agree with me on this one, Uma Thurman is a complete babe in this!! Hope you like it!",10,0,1,5 April 2004
Vanilla Sky," I'm frozen, and you're dead....and I still love you
","Very twisted and difficult to believe, it seems to be more of a movie for those of us out there who still belive in such a thing as love at first sight, and that dreams can be very real... This movie, is older and seems to be a Love/Hate type and I hope that people who check here get a chance to read this because I think it's worth watching solely because if it connects to you, it will probably instantly become one of your top ten fav's. It's definitely 'out there', no question, but Cruise, Diaz, Jason Lee and Penelope Cruz, (maybe Kurt Russell too) do incredible jobs and make the relationships very believeable (for instance the scene where cruise picks lee up in his car and they make small talk) if you can track my rating it's obvious that I am a little biased in my review, but I'm pretty sure that it's not unfounded and this movie has a lot of both entertainment and redeeming value if a little suspension of disbelief is your forte.",10,0,1,5 April 2004
