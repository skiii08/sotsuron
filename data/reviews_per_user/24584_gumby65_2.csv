The Monuments Men," If You Think You Won't Like It - Then You Won't.
",I had mixed feelings about watching 'The Monument's Men'. To be honest - My initial feelings to the trailer were that I wouldn't like the movie. I was right...I'm not a George Clooney fan... His acting is something similar to plaster drying. So to read that George had such huge influence in this movie had me concerned. I was expecting bland and it delivered just that.The cast also had me worried. Whilst some of the names were great in their own genre. Putting them together in a wartime drama also had me worried that the chemistry just wouldn't be right. It wasn't. Bill Murray seemed handicapped and Matt Damon equally so. Neither has the scripting or direction to shine.Add to all this a story twisted to be a pro USA propaganda piece about how they once again saved our civilization from destruction and you have this movie.It's not pretty watching actors struggle through a movie... It's even more difficult when the story could have been so much better. Knowing what could have been...Don't bother watching The Monument Men. It's 118 minutes of your life you would have better spent sleeping. Or washing your car or doing the weekly grocery shopping.,1,3,6,3 May 2014
Django Unchained," Tarantino Back To His Best !!
",I have to admit - Tarantiino kind of lost me with 'Jackie Brown' and 'Inglorious Basterds' - 'Basterds' had a couple of great scenes such as the opening scene... But the rest let me down.However - 'Django Unchained' see's Tarantino returning to his best !! Right from the beginning - This story has you hooked.Typical Tarantino dialog between characters and lots of his famous blood splattering throughout to punctuate the story dramatically.I don't want to spoil the story here - So i won't. Let's just call it a typical western(Sorry Quentin - Make that a Southern)mixed with copious amounts of Tarrantino magic. Think 'Pulp Fiction' with horses and saddle sores.I love Tarantino's Aussie accent when he's playing along side Australian actor John Jarratt. Samuel L. Jackson once again steals his scenes with an intensity that scares you. I was blown away by Trinity's song being included at the end. I'm so pleased Tarantino shares my love of those old 'Trinity' movies...Great cast. Great story. Masterfully directed with a superb soundtrack... 'Django Unchained' will fulfill you cravings for Tarantino escapism. Great work Quentin - 10/10.Cheers Mark P.,10,2,6,12 January 2013
