Walk the Line," Best acting
","To anyone who has not seen this movie....GO GO GO!! One of the best performances I have seen. Joaquin Phoenix, gave an amazing performance as Johnny Cash. I am amazed at how great his voice was and impressed at all the effort that went into this movie. I have not followed his career, but I can say for sure he gave a stellar performance. An actor with such brilliance should be mentioned more than once. I look forward to seeing him in other roles. Reese Witherspoon as well made this movie great. As I am sure you all know by now. She won best actress. This should further her career in more dramatic roles. Direction should also be complimented in this movie. I am so glad that the actors learned how to sing, it made the movie that more real. As well as the other musicians featured in the movie, I am speechless! This will be one of the movies that will go down as being remarkable.",10,2,4,6 March 2006
