The Incredible Hulk," Finally, a Hulk film that hits (smashes) the right note
","I try to see most comic book films as I thoroughly enjoy this genre, some films don't quite make the grade but this is an excellent new interpretation of the most iconic 'Hulk' franchise. Certainly commendable for the slick mix of comic book lore and fond homage to the original TV series. An excellent cast pulled off playing great characters and (as with Iron Man) you can tell they really enjoy the roles and what they mean. Once the action starts it keeps you glued to the screen and is well paced. Special effects are cutting edge and, in general, the photography is superb and they blend very well. The story is not overly complicated however adequate for what is expected. If you love comic book films and love the big green guy, go see this film! :)",9,4,10,13 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda 2," Very pleasantly fulfilled
","Yes I was the only grown man sat in the 10:40am showing of this film on my own. And yes I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was more of the same fun from the first film but progressed a little bit more with character background, a simple cultural story, and plenty of action. And it wasn't just these points I enjoyed, it was the general 'feel' of the film as a beautifully crafted homage to a few Chinese animated stylings. Voices were once again perfect for each character, with special note towards Gary Oldman and Danny McBride. Music was as fantastical as the animation and really builds the film as an excellent artistically entertaining piece. A superb sequel that other sequels should take note of. I left the theatre feeling both satisfied and elated, wanting just that little more of the film. And yes that does mean I would like to see one more Kung Fu Panda sequel.",9,0,1,22 July 2011
