Raiders of the Lost Ark," The absolute classic of classics !!!
","No further comments, just a must see.I must have seen (experienced) this masterpiece at least 30 times, and so far it got better every time I saw it. This film WILL stand the test of time.This is where the Spielberg / Lucas cooperation really payed off to the max.
