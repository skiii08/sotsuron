The Monuments Men," Oh dear.
","When they could get it so right with Private Ryan, how could they get it so wrong with this? In case you are wondering this is set in wartime Europe, yet every town and city is lit up like Disneyland on steroids - apparently never heard of the blackout. Even military camps near the front line are complete with floodlighting and every soldier wandering around carrying a torch, that's not to mention the shower tent with lashings of hot water at the Battle of the Bulge!
Paris in wartime apparently had loads of women dressed to the nines gazing at the latest fashions on display in the shops, even Cate Blanchettes flat was stuffed with every mod con and of course lashings of food and wine.
War torn Europe after almost five years of war was a place of misery and deprivation, with destruction that obviously could not be imagined by the producers of this film.
It completely ruined the whole structure of the film, the team appeared to be looking for stolen good in downtown New York!",2,2,5,15 March 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A big disappointment
","I am beginning to believe that I am the only person who was disappointed by this sequel. The film distinctly lacks pace and often grinds to a dead stop. Scenes which should be rolling along with the velocity of a runaway train, stagger and falter like a drunk. For example the overlong scene between Jack Sparrow and the cannibals. The main characters boarded and left the Flying Dutchman so rapidly I lost track of what ship they were supposed to be on after a while.I'm afraid the film has fallen into the Star Wars trap of replacing plot with special effects.Watch the first Pirates and then this one and you will see what I mean.",4,11,17,12 August 2006
