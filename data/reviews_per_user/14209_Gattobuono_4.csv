Sucker Punch," 'If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything'
","Fortunately for me, I watched this film with absolutely zero expectations.I missed all the original hype, and it was purely by 'chance' that a piece of music that I'd heard on youtube led me to Sucker Punch.I fell in love with this film from the very beginning. I let myself be carried along on a wonderful visual and musical journey, a fantasy within a fantasy laced with layers of meaning that need not be analysed ... simply absorbed.Sucker Punch is a work of Art that will surely become a cult classic once the haters have finished tearing it apart and gone away to find other films that give them what they want without 'sucker punching' their linear minds.It's an unfortunate human trait that people feel the need to deride and destroy that which they don't understand. They can't simply say 'I don't get it', or 'it isn't for me'. Somehow they feel threatened ... they feel that they should 'get it', and if they don't 'get it' it must be inherently bad.And it's not as if there's much to 'get'. The film won't reveal 'the meaning of life' to you, although it might just reinforce the 'meaning' of your life. I guess that some people are looking so hard for deeper meaning that they miss the simple and obvious.If you've never seen Sucker Punch, please give it a try, and as you watch it, simply let it play out before you without trying to analyse. And if it really doesn't hold any great 'meaning' for you ... so what? ... you've just been treated to a beautifully filmed fantasy with some of the coolest fight choreography/dancing you'll ever see!'If you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything.'

Guardians of the Galaxy," People Who Gave This Movie More Than 5/10
","... are either ...1. getting bribed by the producers 2. friends or relatives of the producers 3. incredibly gullible and without any real points of reference as to what constitutes a good movie.The current IMDb of 8.1 is a huge insult to every great film out there.SPOILER: This film, with it's flat lifeless acting, non-plot, and terrible childish 'humour' will SPOIL YOUR BRAIN CELLS.DO NOT WATCH ... YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!P.S. this is a gratuitous line of text to enable me to reach the IMDb required 10 lines....... oh dear, looks like I need to add a few more gratuitous words because I still haven't driveled on enough..... are we there yet?okay ... we're done here!",1,29,58,22 December 2015
Everest," A Great Hollywood Movie Disaster
","No, that's not an error of syntax, 'Movie Disaster' is an entirely fitting epithet for the two hours of bland clich√©d drivel that I just subjected myself to.Synopsis:
A group of wealthy, entitled, and in some cases entirely unfit people need to bolster their fragile egos.
In order to do this, they travel to a third world country to climb to the top of the world biggest rock because ... 'reasons'.
The big rock isn't that cool with they idea of having silly little people clambering all over it and leaving their s##t everywhere, so with the help of his friends snow, wind, and ice decides to show them whose boss.Surprisingly ... big rock wins!In Short:
Insipid dialogue.
Stereotypical Hollywoodian characters.
Zero character development.
Obligatory nausea inducing soppy bits.
Total lack of info about why certain key failures happened (read the books).
... and why should we give a damn about these idiots anyway?Save your time and watch something decent, such as Touching The Void.",2,1,6,1 March 2018
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Once again America saves America ... whoops, I mean Planet Earth!
","I don't have much to add to the bad reviews that other IMDb users have contributed, as it's pretty much all been said before: great CGI, terrible script, dreadful talentless botox lipped lead female ... etc.However, I'd like to make one little observation, and it's not specific to this film in particular, although Transformers 3 is a classic example.My observation is this: America is NOT The World!Yes, I know that this may come as a shock to many people whose global knowledge is gleaned from Michael Bay Films, in which SAVING PLANET EARTH equates to SAVING America.I know it's confusing that in a film about a so called global attack all of the action takes place in one part of one American city.Also ... did any of you know that there are other military forces in existence apart from the US Army, US Air Force and the famous US Navy SEALS? Yes it's true ... look it up on the internet! So, my real bone of contention with Bay is not the spectacular drivel that he produces, but his reinforcement of the America-centric vision that is ultimately pretty insulting to any non-American with a brain.",3,0,3,21 July 2014
