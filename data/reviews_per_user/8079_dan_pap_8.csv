Spartacus," second half is brilliant
","'When a free man dies, he loses the pleasure of life. A slave loses his pain. Death is the only freedom a slave knows. That's why he's not afraid of it. That's why we'll win.'Spartacus is widely considered to be one of the best epic films ever made. I had my expectations set pretty high, hoping to see some awesome battle sequences, a great script, and beautiful scenery. Throughout the start of the film (a couple scenes before the intermission), I was disappointed. Sure the movie's beautiful, but it was missing the X-factor of what makes a great movie. Things just weren't clicking. A romance was desperately trying to blossom and the story just wasn't as engaging as I'd hoped.Eventually though, all the pieces of the story start fitting together. We start to see more of Laurence Olivier, and the romance, though cheesy, is developed more. After the intermission, Spartacus turns into an entirely different movie, with brilliant lines and breathtaking shots. I've never seen a movie do a complete 180 as dramatically as this one. I absolutely love the last half of this.Kirk Douglas basically owns this movie, but I'm not as impressed by him as I am with the supporting cast. Laurence Olivier is terrific as Crassus and Peter Ustinov gives some great comedy that isn't cheesy or dated at all. Kirk Douglas is solid, but I feel a different actor could have given a similar if not better performance (I kept thinking Charlton Heston).The last half of the film contains so many unbelievable shots. Kubrick does his best to convey emotion to the audience, showing the happy and the sad. Showcasing this emotion makes Spartacus over three hours long, but I think every minute of the movie counts, and I wouldn't take out anything, though the beginning scenes could be shaved.What I found most interesting is that the overall style is a mix between the trademark style of the Golden Age era and more modern filmmaking. Spartacus has obviously influenced other great movies, and it's interesting to connect later films to Spartacus.I loved the second half of the film, but upon second viewing, I'd skip most of the first half. It's not bad, per se, just unimpressive. To truly be taken away by the beauty of Spartacus start at the intermission.",8,1,2,17 June 2019
A Star Is Born," beginning is great
","'Talent comes everywhere, but having something to say and a way to say it to have people listen to it, that's a whole other bag.'My overall opinion of A Star is Born is that it's very safe. I'd never seen the original version, but within the first ten minutes, I could literally predict the entire plot. I don't really mind predictable storylines, but for a movie that received as much hype as this one, I was hoping for something a little more.Everything about A Star is Born is pretty much done by the book. Cooper is solid in his role as an actor and a director, though I found his Sam Elliot impersonation to be a little odd. The music is really good, and I really wish we could have heard more songs from Jackson Maine. There are plenty of celebrity cameos which make fans go berserk.The first half of this movie is much better than the last half. I wish this film would have included time stamps, because there are a few things that are incredibly rushed between the two main characters.I don't really have too much more to add about this one. Sam Elliot is probably the best character. Gaga is impressive, Cooper is too. I just wish the movie didn't seem so formulamatic. This doesn't really seem to be the career-marking film that this was hyped to be for anyone involved. It's good, but I've definitely seen better. I have no desire to see it again.",7,1,1,1 July 2019
Deadpool 2," gonna be a no for me
","It's been a minute since I've seen the original Deadpool, but I remember really enjoying it. It was a Marvel movie that didn't follow the traditional Marvel formula. I was hoping Deadpool 2 would be just as enjoyable as the first. Unfortunately, I wasn't amused.In my opinion, Deadpool 2 doesn't offer anything more from the first one. There's still references, there's still breaking the fourth wall, there's still that trademark self-awareness. I don't really know what else I expected, but after the first five minutes, it just got old. The opening credits are especially cringe.The first one sold me on its shock value, but the novelty wore off in Deadpool 2. I must admit, a good amount of the comedy is perfect and there are a few great lines to quote. I like the soundtrack too (minus the dubstep), but that's about all I see. I already have a chip on my shoulder when I see a Marvel movie, especially one with a child actor, so perhaps that's the reason this doesn't work for me.On a different day, I might have liked this, but for now, it's gonna be a solid pass.",5,1,2,7 June 2019
Taxi Driver," good, not a masterpiece
","'Loneliness has followed me my whole life.'This is one of those movies that has no real plot. The story tracks Travis Bickle as he drives his taxi through New York City. As the film progresses, we learn more about Bickle and how his loneliness slowly drives him to madness.I understand why people like this movie so much. There's nothing bad about it at all. The music and writing are incredible. Right from the get-go the music sets the mood for the rest of the film. The direction is great too, and I think a cab driving down the streets of New York provides Scorsese countless opportunities to show off. The main highlight of the film is Robert De Niro, a man born to play Travis Bickle.Normally I like character-centered movies like this one, but Taxi Driver just never settles in for me. I don't hate the movie, but I don't love it like many folks do. I feel that the movie drags a bit. I understand that there are many meanings, some ambiguous, but I think the movie could have used a bit more psychological terror. Don't get me wrong, it has its moments (i.e. De Niro shaving his head and the hallway scene), but I was hoping for a bit more.Again, I think this is a well-executed film, I was just hoping for it to resonate more with me. I'm gonna have to rewatch this.",8,0,1,6 July 2019
A Quiet Place," bird box is better
","It sounds like the only reason people like this is because of the novelty. The novelty wears off after like a half hour and all we see are frightened stares from Emily Blunt and the rest of the cast. There are a couple issues with the story that I'm not going to get into, but these holes really weaken the concept. The suspense is well-done, but this should really just be a Black Mirror episode.",5,0,2,3 June 2019
La La Land," should have won best picture
","Everything about this movie is remarkable. From opening number (probably one of my favorite scenes ever) to the final montage (again, probably one of my favorite scenes ever), La La Land is a mesmerizing story about following your dreams. The film starts with an energetic, catchy, and beautifully choreographed tune called 'Another Day of Sun' which really has nothing to do with the story, but sets up the mood and the context. From there, we follow two main characters as they pursue their dreams together. For Seb, a jazz musician. For Mia, an actress.La La Land's most notable features are the music, colors, choreography, and cinematography. The music, written by Justin Hurwitz, perfectly fits and forms the mood of every scene. I really have no complaints about any of the songs. There are so many different hues of colors, and each scene seems to have a different color scheme. I don't know too much about dancing, but to the extent of my knowledge the choreography is brilliant and entertaining (though no comparison to Gene Kelly). The cinematography strategically combines elements of both a Golden Era masterpiece and a stage play, while also providing space to showcase the colors and music.The actors try hard, but to be honest, I personally don't like any of the actors in this. Other than my personal distaste of casting, I have no complaints of La La Land. It's a visual and musical masterpiece that I plan to watch many more times.",8,2,2,13 August 2019
La Vie En Rose," not as good as i'd hoped
","La Vie en Rose is another movie that's been sitting on my shelf a while. It's a biographical film about the late great Édith Piaf. I'm familiar with Piaf's music, but I knew little else about her before watching this.The overall structure of the film is a little wonky. At times, there are three separate storylines in progression, each taking place at a different part of Piaf's life. This makes it a tad confusing. I assume this is done to have La Vie en Rose stand out among other biopics, but it's not as effective as I think they'd hoped.I also think there are some parts of Piaf's life that are completely glossed over (i.e. her marriages). After reading a bit more about Édith Piaf, I learned that she got addicted to morphine after surviving multiple car crashes, which are nearly forgotten. I understand why some decisions are made, but the film focuses heavily on her addiction, yet neglects to mention the core cause.
Marion Cotillard won an Oscar for her role in this, becoming the first foreign actress to win Best Actress. She's unrecognizable as Édith Piaf, and I think she immerses herself into the role quite well. I don't know of Piaf's mannerisms or dialect, so I can't really judge those. As far as acting is concerned, Cotillard does well, especially in the scene with Marcel's watch.This isn't really a movie I'd be eager to watch again. It's long, boring at times, and I've seen better biopics. I think it captures the tragedy and the sadness of Piaf's life, but mostly thanks to Cotillard. I love the music and the culture of France, but I don't find myself ever falling in love with La Vie en Rose.",6,3,3,23 June 2019
Inside Llewyn Davis," oscar isaac+folk music+cohen brothers
","Film info & reviews
Play trailer
Play on Prime
I went into this movie blind. I knew it had a good reputation, but other than that, I knew nothing about this. The opening song really drew me in, and set this up to be a really great movie. It didn't take long for me to recognize the trademark style of the Coen brothers, which made me like it even more.
I can't say enough good things about this movie. In fact, I can't really say any bad things. The entire story is entertaining and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. The direction, the acting, the writing....everything is impeccable. I especially enjoyed the short cameos from John Goodman and F. Murray Abraham.Despite everything great about this movie, what makes it brilliant in my book is the music. I'm like folk music as it is, and all the songs in Inside Llewyn Davis are great by any standard. I could easily listen to this album every day and still want more. As a side note, the ending nod to Bob Dylan offered quite the finish.In short, main highlights are the acting (Isaac's talent continues to blow me away) and the music, along with a little bit of smart humor. This is highly recommended for people who love watching talent showcased on screen, because everyone involved is at their very best here.",8,0,0,13 August 2019
