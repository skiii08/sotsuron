The Ring," One of the best horror movies....
","the ring has everything, horror, drama, suspense, thrill and to add to that the cinematography is also excellent, especially the horse scene and other scenes taken from above. although the movie moves on slowly there is not a single dull moment, thanks to the extremely scary scenes at the right moments. the very first scary scene of the little girl in the closet had my heart in my mouth..the scenes at the climax are undoubtedly the best!! they had a long lasting effect on my mind. i really hope the sequel lives up to the expectations which the ring has created. to sum it up...this is a quality movie and i would recommend everyone to watch it at least once.P.S. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR WEAK HEARTED PEOPLE..!!!",8,0,1,7 February 2005
