50 First Dates," Funny and simple
","50 First Dates is a funny and sweet comedy. Adam Sandler can make some terrible movies, this is not one of them",8,1,1,28 May 2019
Captain Marvel," Pretty good
","I am not a fan of all powerful superheroes with no weakness. I never read Captain Marvel so there may be flaws I'm not aware of so we'll see in Endgame.
Pretty much a typical Marvel origin movie. Entertaining but no over the top end of movie battle like DC does to ruin it. Definitely as good as any of the MCU movies",7,0,1,10 March 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," Should have been a DC movie
",Not very good. I expect this drivel from DC. The ending fight scene was bad and I was embarrassed I brought my children to this movie.,5,0,0,6 June 2019
Joker," Damn good movie
","I expected little with it being attached to DC.
I was wrong and wrong again. This the best 'origin story' movie I've ever seen. The movie did a good job of following his descent into madness and gave him sympathy.
Of course some folks will not like this but to me it makes the character complete. Total hate for the Joker would make him one dimensional and that would be typical DC. Hey Heather!
This ain't that movie",10,3,5,12 January 2020
Get Him to the Greek," Silly but laugh out loud funny
",Typicall silliness but I laughed out loud many times.,8,1,1,3 March 2019
