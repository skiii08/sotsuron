The Longest Yard," Damn You Sandler
","I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler and his movies, but I hate The longest Yard, really... Ido! Guys with muscles, but not either humor or any other elements of this sort including in this movie. It just feels stupid to watch. Even Chris Rock feels very bright as Co/Coach for the prisoners. It surprise me at this movie can go up and be one of the most successfully movies of 2005, or well; maybe not.... since Chris Rock and Adam Sandler is in it, but still - it sucks.If you instead want to watch something funny with Sandler, watch Litte Nicky, Happy Gilmore or Spanglish.Hopefully Click will be better.",4,6,13,14 January 2006
Grave of the Fireflies," Oh My God
","I've just finished watching The Grave of the Fireflies for the first time, and I tell you my brothers ... I did cry like a little baby, I really did. This was just to much for me to handle, and Im still shaking. This was amazing in every single aspect. The story line just feels so pure and genuine. But there is no reason for me to go one about the story and its impact, because everyone already knows how emotional this film is. I really have a hard time writing this since I for some reason cant stop crying, but I tell you my brothers .. don't miss one of our times best films, anime or not ... because this is truly one piece of art.Now Im going to light a cigarette and cry myself to sleep.",10,3,5,3 April 2007
