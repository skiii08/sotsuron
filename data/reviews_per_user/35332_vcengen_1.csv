Angels & Demons," The movie and the book must be evaluated separately
","Two days ago, I've finished reading the Dan Brown's novel and right after I've watched the movie.First of all: Do not ever do like this! :) (I'm talking not only for 'Angels & Demons' but for all novel adaptations.)Because the novel will cloud your judgement about the movie. Yes, I totally agree with the comments saying 'the movie is way different than the book' but it is impossible to adapt a whole book for a certain amount of time. Therefore changes are inevitable.Considering that, I might say that the movie is an above average Hollywood production with lots of action and mystery. My point is 6.5/10.Like I wrote, I can understand changes but why did they change some names of characters? (Like Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca - Camerlengo Patrick McKenna or Cpt.Rocher-Cpt.Richter) That was the only thing I couldn't understand.",7,4,8,20 August 2009
