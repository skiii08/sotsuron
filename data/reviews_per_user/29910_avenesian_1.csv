Scarface," Simply heart-shattering
","This movie is simply the most soul tearing, heart-shattering movie of all time. Tony Montana is arguably the best performance Al Pacino has pulled in his whole career. -To a very real extent, he challenges Marlon Brando's interpretation of Don Vito Corleone. I mean it when I say most heart shattering. No other movie can in any way parallel Scarface in the rotten way everything is portrayed. The main character Tony Montana is not one you will like. You will simply despise him, and when he in the end does die, you don't know if to feel good or bad. The sequences of violence can turn your stomach, and sometimes its good, even for the toughest of viewers to simply look away. The moments where the characters have a good time, you will only shake your head and wrinkle your nose; you won't have any relief at any point in this over two and a half hour long movie.At the end you are simply exhausted. So many terrible things have been shown to you, you don't quite know if you want to see any more.In any case it is a masterpiece. When I got out of my chair at the end of the movie, I was almost shaking. I have seen a whole lot of bad movies in my time, but I felt almost the same way after seeing this, as I felt as a ten year old after seeing a horror movie. I was torn apart, and it remains one of my favorite movies. Not because the movie is especially enjoyable, but because I appreciate the masterpiece is really is, and it does teach you a thing or two about the drug business. This movie was released only because of the fact that it might teach the public something; otherwise it would never have been shown at a single theater. Initially rated X, you might understand what kind of a movie it is.Its somehow strange that rap artists around the world want to identify with this movie. The image isn't cool; its not something that will give you merit. For my own part, I love the movie, and I lose all respect for anyone who would like to identify with this. Most people who see it simply never want to see it ever again...",10,0,1,17 April 2005
