Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," You'll never witness a movie created like this again
","Borat is a one of a kind film. It's like a one-man-show version of Jackass, yet instead of doing painful stunts, Borat commits to highly controversial and publicly invoking stunts of cultural misunderstandings. Many will be offended, but the open-minded will see that this film plays off of cultural misunderstanding, and how we as Americans react to that.Plot- Borat (a fictional Kazakhstani man portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen) travels abroad to America where he discovers culture. There is a fake disruption by his fascination of Pamela Anderson, causing him to chase her all the way out in California. Yet, his trip still encompasses alot of America, resulting in a cringe-worthy, hilarious, and overall crazy adventure.Characters/Acting- Sacha Baron Cohen is the main event. He pulls himself through such awkward situations without ever slightly breaking character- all while being in real situations- and manages to make you die from laughter. Whether you're easily offended or not, he will make you laugh in an uproar at least once.Writing- There may have possibly been minimal writing in terms of a screenplay, considering basically all of the scenes are pulled off in front of complete strangers, but I'd say whoever wrote whatever is genius. They play off of a simple factor- cultural confusion- and let it roll out like the red carpet. Every scene makes me laugh like an idiot.Quality- The film is essentially a mockumentary- including some cinematic scenes that are acted out- but the end product is honestly touching. The filming is amazing, even for being primarily in the reality television style. The situations this actor had to undergo (92 police discrepancies) as well as memorizing lines in public still makes it so uniquely hilarious. Nothing is more hilarious than a real reaction to indifference.Overall Borat is an essential Comedy film, at least of my generation. When I first saw it as an 11 year old, I laughed incredibly hard. When I saw it again as a 23 year old, every scene held me hostage. Just plain perfection in my eyes. Many people could be turned away by the religious offensiveness, but at the end of the day, a character is a character, and we must accept the fact that they may have offensive perspectives. That's why you watch a movie. Murder is repulsive, yet we go see every slasher movie that comes out- right?",10,3,5,6 May 2019
The Babadook," Don't expect the scariest, but it has great moments
","The Babadook is essentially one of those 'artsy' horror films, to the point where you'd almost call it a Dramatic Thriller. This movie does not use obnoxious music or jump scares to get you, it's more methodical and about 70% of it is Drama. The rest is pretty scary.Plot- It's about a grieving widow taking care of her dysfunctional son, who begins to talk about this imaginary friend called The Babadook. The boy later tell his mom that he found him in a book of the same name, which the mother doesn't recall ever owning. About halfway through, the tension built really starts to settle in, and there are very memorable scary moments. The ending was intense, but the resolution will leave you asking 'How is that even realistic?' or 'Why did that solve the problem?' Writing- This movie is written very well in a sense that you feel the way the main character does. There aren't too many calm scenes that you'll walk away with, but all of it is realistic aside maybe some people constantly bringing up the dead husband to the widow. Acting/Characters- The acting was great, the movie is in an anxious kind of realm so it can be hard to really make every actor stand out. The Babadook itself was scary as hell although you just barely see it's silhouette.Quality- The film is shot perfectly I'd say, one of the cinematography jobs in a recent Horror film. The way they maintain the same consistency of shot length is so smart in terms of actually scaring you, since you never know when something is building up to that moment. The mood is well executed through visuals, some scattered music, and convincing actors. Overall I downgraded this from 10 because the ending is a big 'shrug' moment, and it's almost too boring- almost. But the scary parts, as well as the build up to those parts make the film worth watching. A good movie to watch if you want a tame Horror film.",7,0,1,29 July 2018
The Irishman," Nominated for 10 Oscars??? Psssht
","Just like many Scorsese fans, I was waiting for this movie to come out since the day I heard of it. I didn't know exactly what it would be, even though I knew who was going to star in it. But once I spent a grueling 3 and a half hours (divided into 2 days) I just found myself sleepy, bored, let down.Plot- The story follows the memory of an assassin that had something to do with the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. I think it's extremely drawn out, like, I was yawning an hour in. Doesn't matter how flashy SOME scenes can be, doesn't matter that we have the gangster actor aficionados of our lifetime on screen, and most importantly- it doesn't matter that it is directed by one of the finest filmmakers ever. It was just underwhelming. Scarface is 3 hours and feels like 2, just like Casino. I was bored.Characters/Acting- You know, I love DeNiro, but the guy never plays anyone but DeNiro. He's like a glamorized Seth Rogen at this point. I know the main cast is elderly, but dude, we get it. Pesci plays a quiet guy, barely hear him half the time. Pacino, on the other hand, kills it. He's the only guy I observed in admiration. Otherwise all the other characters could have been yanked right from a bad episode of the also highly overrated 'The Supranos.'Writing- It was good, nothing I remember though. Yada yada, bunch of tough guys talking. Some parts are tense near the end. Otherwise it's just kinda bland.Quality- Great cinematography, great editing, but I mean some parts weren't believable. There's a scene where DeNiro is kicking someone and it just made me laugh. Lazy stuff.Overall, I turned on this film being a solid Scorsese fan- I loved The Departed, Goodfellas, Casino, Wolf Of Wallstreet, Taxi Driver, the George Harrison documentary. But this is seriously, immensely overrated. It's like an effect that diehard Kanye West fans experience- no matter what your favorite artist does, you love it, you praise it. I can finally say that Scorsese is capable of making not so impressive films. He should shut up about Marvel and make something super himself.",6,1,3,25 January 2020
Bird Box," It's like it wanted to have a theme so badly
","Bird Box is definitely a quality film- there's some good acting in it, decent dialogue, and an interesting method of narrative. But at the end of the day, it's just got nothing to offer.Plot- A pregnant woman faces an apocalyptic world where anyone who looks outside dies by hallucinating and killing themselves. Birds can sense when the 'entity' or whatever is near. The burning hot issue for me was that the film never once explains why this happens, as well as why some people can see and just want to watch others kill themselves. Not once. It just sort of ends hoping that you forgot about the whole supernatural element of the film. And i think for that reason, the same plot could have been used with a different protagonist, maybe one who finds the answer.Writing- Dialogue isn't unbearable, but I will say that some scenes feel way to stagnant. Characters don't quite have their own personality, such as the first scene where we have 3 women talking to each other, all using the same snarky tone, all making back to back wise cracks. It was an awkward scene that shows the importance of distinguishing a character on screen. No one wants to see multiple characters with the same personality.Characters/Acting- As said before, the characters are relatively stagnant, aside Bullock, her live interest, and an antagonist they unintentionally meet. Acting was good aside MGK who is just way too much like him real self. Did the producers ask the writer 'hey can you just throw in a rap star and have him be some sort of doctor in the film that complains the whole time?'Quality- Well shot and edited, a very good aspect of the film actually. The music isn't bad at all. The style of the story being inthe past and present was nice.Overall this movie is nothing to go nuts for. I only watched it because of the hype, and I cannot see why there was any to begin with. Yes it starts right away, gets you interested, feels intense. But once we get to the last third of the film, all of it drops and we starve for reasoning. If you can watch a movie that makes you curious for its entirety and doesnt even try to hint at an explanation, feast your eyes. Other wise you'll be like me, waiting at the last 10 minutes of runtime for your mind to be blown, only to get that waste-of-my-time stomach ache.",5,0,3,31 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," 'I am inevitable'
","Endgame is a movie surrounded with mountains of hype, but it lives up to it in ways you wouldn't expect. I will not say it is the most action packed film out there, nor was it destined to be, but it is surely the most emotional Marvel movie created.Plot- If you have seen Infinity War, you know that whatever the plot may be is almost a surprise. The writers could have made it easier on the Avengers, but they didn't, thus resulting in a highly entertaining experience in which you must accept the fact that the solution is mostly unbelievable. But this is a Marvel movie we are speaking of. Any realistic criticism should be set aside for movies based on reality.Writing- Marvel got it down beautifully. The way they portray characters in a new light, the way they nail those corny one-liners, the way they interlock the storylines is so amazing yet nothing far from simplistic. They didnt have to go far, they just needed a duration in which they could fulfill each characters destiny. And it is not a rushed process; there is a reason this film is 3 hours.Plot- This movie takes on a plot nobody expected. When it displayed a time lapse, I was shocked yet thrilled. There is a reason they didn't spoil much in the trailer.Characters- Nobody is cut short here. Although it is a long film, not one important character is left shorthanded. Maybe some are, but if so, they are left totally open eneded for another film. I cannot spoil this but I will say a major Marvel hero will definitely make another appearance in the upcoming film in phase 5. We obviously know about Guardians 3 and Spiderman: Homecoming, so I will not reveal who will be most prevalent.Writing- The writing is downright awesome, probably some of the best that they've done. We have characters that bend out of form, hilarity that actuallly has perfect timing, as well as emotion unlike no other Marvel film. For me, 'Logan' had alot of emotional weight, and this was similar, although they pertain to alternating Marvel Universes. The humour is on point. Never a missed beat.Characters/Acting- For me, I always think about the contrast between actor and character. I feel like, just as most Marvel movies containing the same characters, that they were uber successful. You feel for these characters- maybe not as much as you would observing them from the start, but they are true to form. Who else would have played these mighty beings?Quality- Endgame is no joke. It's not a cash-in kind of buy, these people knew what their fans deserved. The editing is prime, the filming is loose yet focused, the sound is perfect, the animation is mind blowing- observe how they make Michael Douglas appear 40 years younger- and the sequencing is phenomenal.Overall. Endgame does what most logical people want, as well as what most kids don't expect- emotional justification. It's reality. It takes about an hour or so to truly kick in the full-on action, but when you're a fan of the series, you truly understand. It's more about the intensity. The action is delivered at a high caliber, but this story is primarily about the power struggle between humanity and the unknown. Truly amazing.",10,2,6,30 April 2019
The Love Guru," C'mon. Y'all are a bunch of haters.
","Everyone states that this movie ruined the career of Mike Myers, and maybe it actually did in reality, but that statement is enough to make you think that this film is trash. In actuality, it's funny.Plot- A love guru tries to reunite a hockey player with his wife before the hockey championship. And alot of goofy stuff happens. Nothing too insane but there are some funny Bollywood-esque dance scenes that come about randomly.Characters/Acting- Mike Myers is great as ever, Verne Troyer makes a return, Alba's always a nice touch, Timberlake is a spaz. Overall goofy but still far from intolerable.Writing- Honestly I remember alot of the acronyms the guru makes up, the piss mop scene, Kanye West randomly appearing as a hockey fan. It's very similar to Austin Powers in style, but those films are far much better.Quality- It's got funny music scenes, it's not poorly edited, I mean it's a good goofy comedy. I don't understand the hate. I'd say the movie Get Hard is a totally unfunny movie, in general as well as in comparison. Just an example.Overall it's a good goofy film, if you're willing to watch one. Seriously, don't listen to the hate.",7,0,1,17 February 2020
Get Out," The best directorial debut I've seen since Resevoir Dogs. All hail Jordan Peele.
","Right off the bat I knew Get Out was going to be something unique, sporting a trailer that resembled something so perfectly on the fence between funny and eerie. This is a movie that has oceans of hype and deserves every drop of it, you'll never get a film like this again.Plot- A black man retreats with his white girlfriend to her family home out on the countryside, meeting her family for the first time with insecurity of his ethnicity. He notices that the white folks out there seem to have heightened ideals of black people in terms of physicality, culture, and behavior. The genius of the film is that it takes something so very real, pokes and prods at stereotypes, while also making you laugh at it. I cannot give away much of the plot without spoiling it but I will say this, the plot twist will rock you. Never has a resolution been so culturally relevant, yet also fictionally disturbing.Writing- Perfect writing. The conversations seem natural, yet winkingly objective when foreshadowing. Humor hits you in all the right places, never having an offbeat moment. The whole story and idea behind it is ingenius. I'd really like to sit down with Jordan Peele and investigate him for this one. There's very much a reality behind the script, and I think that reality not only applies to common society, but primarily high society.Characters/Acting- Dude I have nothing but praise so just leave now if you cant believe me. The acting is spot on- you can feel the awkwardness, sense when somebody may not be as they present themselves, and the characters are all pitch perfect for their roles. Sure there is that Horror movie tone to it, but nothing campy or derived. Alot of moments here where the acting really makes the script pop and sizzle, creating unforgettable scenes.Quality- The camera angles and filming are spot on, never having a predictable angle. The opening scene is so simple yet executed with grace, drawing you in immediately. The sound is booming when needed, the violence is pretty nasty but not frequent. The scares come in such a simple form that plays off of your knowledge more than using loud noise and mosterous imagery to shake you.Get Out is a classic. I applauded my TV screen my first time watching it. If you want something that will creep you out, intrigue you, while also making you laugh, sit down and get cozy. The theme of the film is probably the greatest thing about it.",10,1,3,15 February 2019
