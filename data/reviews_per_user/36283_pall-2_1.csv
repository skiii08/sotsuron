The Blair Witch Project," Probably, this is a good movie if you are 16 and under.
","I don't get the hype for this movie at all. It is NOT scary. The premise is good; however it is badly played out. Why is it cool to watch No Story? This movie wasn't fun after twenty minutes. Credit to the directors for an original, student type, cheap movie, but I feel cheated out of my time and money.",Null,0,1,8 September 1999
