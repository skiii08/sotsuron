National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Amazingly awful
","Thank God I only rented this piece of crap and did not waste my time going to a theater. My throwing objects at the screen might have annoyed my fellow movie-goers.Do the people who made this thing, actually think we wouldn't notice how amazingly fast they solved the 'clues'. 'Hmmm, a little scribble on a map. 'I know! This means we have to go to the Statue of Liberty in Paris, put a tiny camera on a tiny helicopter and get the highest quality picture known to man, of another clue. Oh, I know! This clue is plain as day that we have to go to Buckingham Palace, up the dumbwaiter and find a Chinese desk which we will immediately figure out the impossibly difficult code to open it. No problem. We'll take this piece of wood with more little symbols on it because it will surely contain the secret of mankind. Oops, camera doesn't work so we'll use the police street traffic camera. Then we'll have to go to the police station and say something like 'Excuse me Officer, but I need to look through your files and retrieve a picture.' Now I'm not sure about this but I think if I went to Mt. Rushmore and opened a boulder that brought huge rocks falling down, I might draw the attention of one or two security guards. Everything about this movie was ridiculous. Nicholas Cage, whom I dearly love, was so bad, I was actually embarrassed for him.",1,4,8,2 June 2008
