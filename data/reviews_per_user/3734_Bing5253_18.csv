The Benchwarmers," Great Fun!
","The benchwarmers is a funny, feel good movie that guarantees lots of fun. It is about three young men, two have never played baseball in their life and one is a professional. Somehow, with only three players they end up making a team. They make it to beat bullies and to show them that they shouldn't be mean to other children.The Benchwarmers is a very enjoyable movie with some great slapstick moments. It stars David Spade (The Emperor's New Groove), Jon Heder (Napolean Dynamite) and Rob Schneider (Big Daddy).Anyway, have fun watching this great movie.8/10",8,0,0,21 October 2006
Ali," Will Smith holds up a very strong role in a good movie
","Ali is a very entertaining and beautiful movie that stars Will Smith as Muhhammud Ali. The plot is simply the life of Muhammad Ali and his amazing boxing career.One thing that I thought was very interesting was the fact that Will Smith has jumped from mildly silly parts in movies such as Men in Black and also in the T.V. show 'The fresh prince of Bel-Air' to a brilliant performance in a difficult part. His physique is also quite amazing as he is usually not muscular at all but he is very big in this movie. Jami Foxx also co-stars as his sort of coach and also gives a very good performance.Overall, I thought that Ali was a very entertaining and good movie with a strong cast and great acting.8/10",8,1,2,26 October 2006
Memento," Original, well written, WOW!
","Memento is a very original movie that stars Guy Pearce as a man with short term memory loss which means that he can't make new memories since the 'incident'. Leonard is on a quest to find the man that assisted in his injury but the only way he can remember anything he has learnt is by tattooing vital clues on his body and by Polaroid photos. Carrie Ann Moss co-stars as Natalie, a bartender that is helping Leonard find justice. It also has Joe Pantoliano as a shady cop who is also assisting Leonard.Memento is a great movie that is unbelievably written. If you are looking for a movie that is interesting, original and that will keep you thinking about it for the next week then I highly recommend Memento.10/10",10,0,2,3 September 2006
12 Monkeys," Stunning movie that displays Gilliam's amazing talent
","Twelve Monkeys is an insane time-travelling, action packed movie that stars Bruce Willis who plays James Cole, a man who is sent back in time to collect information about the devastating plague that ensues in November of 1996. Unfortunately, he is sent back too far to the year 1990 where everyone believes that he is insane.This movie is thrilling and has great acting performances from Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve monkeys is one of the greatest time travelling movies that I believe anybody can enjoy. Terry Gilliam has created a true masterpiece10/10",9,0,0,31 July 2006
Shaun of the Dead," Man this movie's funny
","Shaun of the is absolutely hilarious. It is pure brilliance. It is stupid, ridiculous but still magnificent. The plot is basically that zombies start taking over the earth and some Average Joe (Simon Pegg) has to decide what he's going to do about. This movie is gory, rude but downright great. It has some great one liners with some subtle humour. The whole movie is basically crazy. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have done a very good job on writing this movie. I hope to see and hear more from both of them. This may be one of the best movies to come out of the United Kingdom.Overall, I would would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a hilarious, fast-paced roller-coaster ride of fun and a whole bunch of hilarity.9/10",9,0,2,28 October 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Great, but not if you like short movies.
","Pirates of the Carribbean 3 is definitely better than the second in the instalment. The plot keeps you hooked till the end and the acting is great as well. The amazing music still stands strong and all the effect and clothing still look magnificent. The third instalment was also a lot more violent than the first and second movies (watch out for hangings) However, this is not for anyone who does not like epic movies. At 2 hours and 50 minutes you need some food with you to keep you going. None of the film is particularly boring but the time doesn't just speed by like it does in other long movies. I also suggest you watch it with a friend as it will make the film all the more fun if there is someone to talk about it with afterwards.To sum up, I highly recommend this film to anybody who does not mind sitting through a long movie. Bring a friend, so you can have more fun and enjoy! 9/10",9,1,1,27 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Great film but a bit soppy
","Don't get me wrong, Spider man 3 was a pretty great film but I have to say that this sequel was too soppy. Too many moments where (if it were on e4) you would hear a track going 'aaaaaaaaaaww' when what they should be saying is 'woah!'. This was definitely the funniest of the three spiderman films with Tpbey Maguire's new look and hilarious personality.Great performances by most actors - mainly James Franco as Harry Osbourne. Excellent baddies throughout the film (there were many) including Sand Man (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace).Overall, I give this film a 9/10 but for it to get 10/10 they need to cut down on the soppiness.",9,1,2,12 May 2007
Snatch," Excellent movie
","Snatch is just hilarious. Wow. Great stuff all round. Brad Pitt is great as usual. Jason Statham is hilarious. And also, this may be my favourite Vinnie Jones film ever because personally, I don't consider him the greatest actor ever. Anyway, back to the film, as I was saying, it's great. Snatch is all about two guys who are involved in illegal boxing and one day they decide to buy a new caravan and all of a sudden it turns into a rip-roaring ride of hilarity which is full of revenge, back stabbing and downright stupidity. The cast is great (even though there are sooooooo many characters), the plot can be a bit confusing but it doesn't matter because it's funny. This movie is slick, funny and bizarre all at the same time. If you are looking for a movie that will keep you laughing for hours after it has finished then I highly recommend Snatch.Enjoy it. 10/10",9,1,2,22 October 2006
Corpse Bride," Beautiful
","Corpse Bride was a work of art. Its beautiful animation, character design and colours created an amazing and dark atmosphere. The models were beautifully crafted and you can see the time, care and attention they put into the designs. The feeling throughout the whole film was very dark and eerie.The plot was entertaining and well written but I thought this film was all visual.I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to everyone.Director: Tim Burton8/10",8,0,0,23 February 2008
The Bourne Identity," Great action movie!
","The Bourne Identity is one of the few great modern action movies.It stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a man with amnesia and does not even know his own name. On his quest to find his identity, the CIA send assassins to kill him. Why? Well watch it and find out.The Bourne Identity is the greatest action movie since Braveheart. It has some e action scenes, some high speed car chases and much much more. It also has some great performances from Brian Cox, Julia Stiles and Clive Owen.Watch this movie if you are looking for a roller-coaster ride of action packed fun! 10/10",9,1,2,23 September 2006
Edward Scissorhands," Funny, touching, GREAT!
","Edward Scissorhands is an imaginative movie from the incredible mind of Tim Burton. Johnny Deppp Stars as Edward, an artificial man that was created by an inventor. However, the inventor died before he could finish Edward so he was left with scissors instead of hands. For years, Edward lived alone in the inventor's mansion. Until, a kind woman named Peggie (Dianne West) arrives at his mansion selling 'Avon' products. Edward goes back with her and falls in love with a beautiful .Edward Scissorhands is a very touching movie that is easily one of Tim Burton's best. It will make you laugh and make you cry. Watch it... soon.9/10",9,1,1,15 September 2006
Spirited Away," Miyazaki's Masterpiece
","Spirited away is definitely one of my favourite animated films of all time. The main character is Chihiro, a girl that has moved away from her old home and school. On their way to their old house, Chihiro, her mum and her dad stumble across and abandoned theme park. Or at least, they think it's abandoned. Soon, Chihiro is ends up in a world of magic, evil witches and strange creatures. Spirited away keeps you gripped from the very beginning. It is one of Miyazaki's many masterpieces and a movie that you will be able to watch several times. Also, this movie is not just for children, I'm sure that adults will love it too.10/10",10,2,3,31 July 2006
Saving Private Ryan," Stunning war movie!
","Saving Private Ryan is a magnificent, beautiful film. It stars Tom Hanks as John Miller a soldier who is hired to take his team to find Private Ryan, a fellow soldier who's three brothers have died in combat. They are told to find him and bring him back even though it is unlikely that he is still alive.Saving Private Ryan was an amazing movie that shows the true teamwork and brotherhood between soldiers in a war. It also has some brilliant acting performances by Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Vin Diesel and Matt Damon. This movie somehow manages to have gross and disgusting action sequences but at the same time it is very touching and moving.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.9/10",9,2,4,28 October 2006
Cars," Another animation masterpiece
","Cars is one of my favourite animation movies that I have ever seen. The animation is simply amazing, the cast is brilliant and it was very well written.Cars stars Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen a fast race car who cares for nobody but himself. On the way to a race in California he gets split up from his friend and ends up in Radiator Springs, a little town with less than a dozen inhabitants. At Radiator Springs, Lightning McQueen has to learn the true meaning of friends. Cars co-stars Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, and Larry the Cable Guy. In cars, every little bit of scenery will blow you away. Even the little details - whether that be the shine on the cars or the tire tracks in the dirt - are amazing as well. The animators of this movie did a great job.Cars is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone 9/10",9,1,2,26 August 2006
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Watch it!
","This movie is brilliant! It stars Jack Nicholson as McMurphy, a man that pretends to be crazy to get out of going to prison. He gets sent to a mental institution and finds out about Nurse Ratched, a strict dictator of the patients in the institution. She however, is not so happy about his new look on how things should be. McMurphy makes new friends and goes on many exciting touching, hilarious and downright amazing adventures.This movie is a classic and will make you laugh, make you cry and keep you gripped until the very end. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has some great acting performances from Jack Nicholson, Danny De Vito, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd and Louise Fletcher.9/10",9,1,2,4 October 2006
Hitch," Good Rom-Com
","I thoroughly enjoyed Hitch even though most movies that are similar to it I would usually dislike. Hitch stars Will Smith as Alex 'Hitch' Hichens, a man that people call the 'Date Doctor' because his job is to help men get a woman to like them in three dates. In Hitch we see him trying to help Albert Brenneman (Kevin James), a pleasant man who wishes he could get a date with Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta) a beautiful and rich woman. Hitch helps him learn the tricks to help him get in with Allegra. Meanwhile, Hitch is having his own dating problems with Sarah Melas (Eva Mendes), a work-a-holic who is obsessed with trying to find out who the 'Date Doctor' really is.Hitch is a sweet, heart warming movie with good acting and hilarious moments. If you are looking for a good laugh then I would definitely recommend Hitch.8/10",8,1,2,26 October 2006
The Simpsons Movie," Great fun!
","WOW! The Simpsons movie does not disappoint. Anyone who is interested in the show will find this hilarious. It has a great plot, tonnes of characters (including the all time favourites) and overall, loads of really funny gags.The Springfield lake becomes so polluted that one more piece of rubbish could make it extremely dangerous. Of course the only man stupid enough to dump more rubbish is the one and only Homer Simpson. This one event sets off a hysterical story following the family in their bid to save Springfield.I would highly recommend this film to anyone. You'll regret it for your whole life if you miss it.9/10",9,1,5,26 July 2007
V for Vendetta," Stunning movie!
","V for Vendetta is an amazing movie that tells the story of V, a terrorist who seeks revenge on the government. As he plans revenge he meets a beautiful young woman named Evey. She starts to get involved in his plans. V for Vendetta has some amazing and explosive action scenes. The effects are almost as stunning as the matrix. It stars Hugo Weaving as V and Natalie Portman as Evey. It also has some great performances from John Hurt and Stephen Rea. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a rip-roaring tale of revenge with some of the greatest action scenes that I have seen all year.9/10",9,1,4,3 October 2006
