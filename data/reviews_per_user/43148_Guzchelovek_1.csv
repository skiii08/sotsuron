The Lobster," Absurd, original and interestingly narrated
","Absurd, original and interestingly narratedWhat gets my attention the most is how Lanthimos introduces us to that dystopian-ish world where everything works so absurdly, but still, he makes us care about everything. You embrace the whole situation and feel part of it. While you're watching the film, you imagine yourself being under those circumstances and trying to know if you'd be up to the conditions that have been imposed. There's no distance between you and that fiction. The cast works just fine and, although the chemistry between the characters is almost invisible, you feel the connection through the dialogs.",8,4,10,31 January 2016
