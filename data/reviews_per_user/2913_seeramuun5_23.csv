The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Boring but not bad
","In general, the drama part of the story is the movie. It is off by the action. Again new characters were included. The film is not able to spend permanent staff.
The song 'The Hanging Tree' was very beautiful. Also the sarcastic bird melody is already perfect. It was a troubled film that could have been nice.",7,4,4,3 July 2018
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," boring
","Kissing comes from love. They extend. Apart from that, it was not bad for the end. But overall it was a faint movie.",5,2,2,28 September 2018
The Maze Runner," Not Bad
","It was a very cliché film. The ability to adapt the kit has reduced this feature. It was not excessive, but it was stereotypical. Apart from this, it seemed that the subjects that progressed more slowly in the book progressed rapidly. They put on a constant voltage until the end. If the cliché scenes were too much, the movie would have been averaged. I do not like the players. Excessive logic fills up. Apart from this, the world created is a movie that can be watched and watched without boredom. The characters were simple. Even the character is wrong. Typecasting.",6,2,2,8 April 2018
The Hunger Games," Excited and beauty world
","It is not a series to be understood from the other movie of the series first. I can not say that I like Jennifer Lawrence and I like her acting. But it could be a good athlete. It is quite obvious that the author is inspired by which films, books and ideas.
I like the world so much. It was a fluent film that could be watched with excitement.
It was a film that had remarkable characters but did not smile at the pros. The stereotypes did not sink. This is a series I like.",8,3,4,3 July 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Best Movie in Serie
","He continued to progress like a really poor quality tv-series . It's like a family member coming out of there. It was completed with this film highlighted in Avengers, where Thor's attractor is powerless. It was better than the other two films. LOKI IS REALLY BORING. They can not put a mold on the film. Other than that, it is also really tight that Thor's mind is in the world. How did this Hulk come in? In general, the Thor series was nothing but an action.",7,3,6,3 July 2018
Suicide Squad," NO!
","In general, it was a meaningless film. The joker character was included in the blank film. However, it had a very simple structure. In general, there was a stupidly designed scenario. Everything in the film was over in a day. However, no character was fully introduced. The film was boring. Harley was the only thing I loved about the film. It's a simple and insignificant film.",6,2,2,3 July 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," Maybe good
","Another cliche American movie! A person with a loser character is again a hero ... And the love between them with a simple hard girl typing.Your characters are all dumped. I did not see a non-classical character. Apart from that, even the leading role is not introduced. It's just a movie made for money.The film is rated high because it is fluent and not boring. It could also be a cliche, though. In short, the film was a snack film that would not get a rating.Also, as we saw at the beginning, 'Sleepers' for the team to get to sleep for 70 years is the proof of how much money is made for me.",7,2,2,8 April 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Beautiful journey
","It was nice to start the journey together. I liked the character of Sam. But Frodo was a weak-willed character in my opinion. In the third film, we see that Sam is better suited for this task. Filmin ends were also nice.",9,2,2,28 September 2018
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," excited and funny
","It was a beautiful action film. The characters were still in trouble. The dwarf did not die at all. The full line-up was forged. Apart from this, it was a completely non-effective film that was entirely focused on action and adventure.",8,2,2,28 September 2018
Twilight," Not bad but cliche
","It was like a simple adolescent movie. They fell in love very quickly. The blue filter that we can not see in other films of the series is sinking too much. Apart from that, it was a simple, ordinary movie.",6,2,3,28 September 2018
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Funny
","A nice start. It was the most beautiful film in the series. Bilbo character was worse than this movie. It was not very good in this movie, but I did not like it. Gandalf goes back to the stage and decorates himself. It was like the Lord of a Classical Ring",8,2,2,28 September 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," boring but insteresting
","I like the presence of the trees very much. Gollum character was also a good character. The last scenes were so beautiful. The battle scenes were not bad either. In general, it was a faint movie from the other two films.",8,3,4,28 September 2018
A Quiet Place," A beautiful thriller movie.
","The script and the story was very nice. There was more than expected scenes. The end was clichÃ© and death scene. The acting was nice. The idea and practice was also very nice. Other than the sudden scenes, horror scenes were successful and impressive. A beautiful thriller movie for me. did not meet my expectations but it was an impressive movie.",8,2,3,9 October 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Funny
","I gave it 8 points. It's the most beautiful superhero movie from Marvel. Of course, it's the most beautiful of these evils. Filmin's comedy was so beautiful. It had a more sincere structure. I like the characters too. Apart from that, the stereotype of 'saving the world' has moved to a wider dimension.
Filmin music was also beautiful. Groot is my favorite character.",8,4,6,3 July 2018
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," best in serie
","WHY? It did not have to be romantic. The first end was more beautiful. Why did not it end? If it was so, I gave it 9 points. Apart from that, it was a pleasant film that was exciting. The show was clearly the best film. Entering new characters was also nice.Serie Total Review: My favorite character was Rosalie. Most do not even know the character. Bella was a really absurd character. The writer did not really do this job. It is in Jacob.
Edward character was a simple, stereotypical lover character. There was no feature. It was unsuccessful.
Generally the characters sucked. I did not know any characters.",7,133,143,28 September 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Not bad
","I rated it 7. It was generally bad from the first movie. But I still love it. Kurt Rusell's character was bad. Apart from this, friendship, family accents made the film very ordinary. The final scene was also very beautiful. The blue man was also beautiful. He was on the Nebula ahead of this movie. That was nice, too.",7,2,3,3 July 2018
Thor," BAD but some funny
","It was the worst film in the film series. Thor character is a character with a cliche designed lousy. In the same way, all the characters in the film sucked with cliché. Everything is over in a few days. Apart from that, I liked the cool comedy part. The players are not bad either.",6,2,3,3 July 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Not Bad for Hobbit
",The worst film in the series. The role of Alfrid and Bart has been greatly exaggerated. The Alfrid looked unbearably high. The presence of Legolas was entirely used to decorate the stage. There were duel stages that were stretched over many degrees. The last movie was for your dwarf to shoot down the film to begin new dying. It was clearly the worst among the films of the Lord of the Rings.,7,3,4,3 July 2018
Parasite," Not the best movie of the director
","The fourth movie I watched from the director. Gwoemul is still in the best movies I've watched. Although the subject of the movie in general was ordinary, it was fun to watch half the movie, other half bothered a little. I like it even though it can't give the effect I expected at the end. Acting and script were nice. Social messages were sufficient again. I like the movie but Gwoemul still best for me!",8,0,1,2 April 2020
Thor: The Dark World," Better than first movie!
","More beautiful than the first movie. When will Loki really die? Even in the 1500-episode series, they do not extend this enemy's death to an enemy. Thor had become smoother as a character than these. It was not bad.",7,3,4,3 July 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," beauty and long(so long)
","We watched Frodo and the others live like two separate films. Expected end. It was a classic. The film in the Shire did not notice anything, and the film added something different. I do not really understand the end, but anyway. Other than that, the characters finished in keeping their classics.",8,2,3,3 July 2018
The Purge," Great idea but fail
","All the bad guys were shot just before attacking? Really? Cliché characters and the bad guys. This good idea, outside the home could have been much more appalling.",4,0,0,13 January 2020
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Classical but I liked
","A new hunger game. Obviously, things that were secretly spinning were not really revealed. Filmin was fine. It was very nice in the dramatic events that happened here. The new characters were not bad either. Apart from that, it was nice and fluent.",8,3,4,3 July 2018
