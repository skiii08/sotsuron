Skyfall," Worst Bond movie ever
","How this movie got a rating of 7.8 I don't know. Actually, it is part of an increasing trend I'm seeing on IMDb where rating scores seem to be manipulated. There are quite a few movies in the Top 250 of all time that very clearly should not be.Best thing about Skyfall - the theme song. That's it.Worst thing - the plot, or more precisely, the total lack of a plot. Let me be clear about this, there is no plot at all - not even an unrealistic plot, none whatsoever.Instead of a plot, it has a series of half-baked, overused, puerile semi-excuses to glue together a few comic-book inspired 'action' sequences. Those 'action' sequences are about as realistic as pigs with wings.This reduces Bond to 'Bond good guy. Fights bad guy.' A sad day for Fleming when a supposed Bond movie is even worse than one of the Fast & Furious movies I accidentally watched the other week. (No idea which one.) I wish there was more to comment on, but 'Skyfall' is to movies what a 'Scandinavian Blue' is to parrots.",1,8,16,11 March 2015
