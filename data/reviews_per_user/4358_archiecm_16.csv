Lucky Number Slevin," Marred revenge flick
","It took me two screenings of this film to discover the major flaw. I was OK with most of the 'mistakes' other nay-sayers mentioned: plot, acting, dialogue, Lucy Liu, and the violence. I don't think revenge solves anything (see the Middle East) but strangely, I like movies about revenge when the wronged party is the one seeking it, e.g., Denzel Washington in Man on Fire. But sometimes the avenger kills innocent people, e.g., Gregory Peck in The Bravados. And this is not good. It creates fertile ground for another revenge movie (innocent bystander's kid hunts down and kills his Dad's killer).In Lucky Number Slevin, the innocent guy is Nick Fisher. Nick is killed simply because Sleven (Hartnet) needs his apartment and ID. So Slevin becomes pretty much the same kind of person he's attempting to wipe out. Therefore his happy ending with Lucy Lui isn't all that happy in my book. And what about those bookies who had to die? They had no part in the killing of Slevin's Mom and Dad. They died for their books that helped Slevin target poor Nick Fisher. See? I have the story down after two viewings.",6,4,8,24 December 2006
The Equalizer," Home Depot denouement not up to rest of scenes
","I never saw or even heard of the TV series upon which this film was based. I enjoy revenge pictures with super efficient warriors like Liam Neeson in Taken and also Man on Fire with Denzel Washington. And most of the killing of bad guys lives up to that level in this film. But when McCall finds his way to the Home Depot and the hostages he has all the advantages: he knows where the tools are, the lights, the best hiding places . . . everything. He should be able to surprise the bad guys easily one by one. In fact isn't it a little out of character for Teddy, the efficient Russian henchman, to continue his pursuit of McCall given that he's totally in enemy territory? A wise adversary would cut his losses I'm thinking. . . wait and fight another day. But McCall makes uncharacteristic blunders as well. Killing a guy with a drill bit is one of them. Even though he heated the bit ahead of time, the fact that it succeeds in the movie is pure fantasy. A drill bit isn't sharp enough to penetrate a skull at least not on the theory of it's effectiveness in drilling into wood. It is a slow cutting device that peels away in thin layers. To actually kill someone who isn't tied down you'd have to slam it into the back of the head with incredible force. Using it like that would be an iffy proposition because of balance and the amount of force needed. The fact that it isn't very sharp would work against you. (And anyway, that's not how it's used here. In the film the victim politely holds still while the drill slowly progresses into the brain, but we don't actually see that.) But a bigger blunder is to get into hand to hand combat with an enemy while other foes are within yards of your position. McCall does just this against the thug with all the mustache wax. They fight for a full minute. I don't remember what weapon McCall tried to use on Waxie but he had ample opportunity to pick up guns from earlier skirmishes and should have used one on him. (Even a sludge hammer would have worked.) Instead they tussle for a full minute or more which would have brought Teddy to the scene in time to win the day. But we're supposed to believe that the store is so big and the other thugs were so far off that they couldn't arrive in time. A full minute? Come on! Up until then I was enjoying the efficiency and coolness of McCall's successes. He was quick and always outsmarted them. And he seemed to be very studious in paying attention to detail and the laws of physics as he contemplated his moves. I liked the closeups of his eyes as they seemed to weigh just how quick he had to be and how accurate. Good stuff. I wish he'd kept that up all the way through.",7,2,5,26 October 2014
42," The First One: Baseball Player or President of the USA
","I was moved by the bravery of Robinson and by the heroism of Branch Rickey. I was disgusted by the racism in America though I already knew it was there. Someone remarked (it may have been MSNBC's Chris Mathews)that if you're the first, you have to have extra strength and courage to withstand the vitriolic insults and bitter hatred. Mathews mentioned Jackie Robinson's strength in that area when talking about President Obama and the tough road he has had. That is why I wanted to see the film and I was not disappointed in that regard--it took superhuman strength not to fight back. But I was disappointed that Robinson's personality wasn't more complex, more interesting. He liked baseball and liked winning and that was about it. He wasn't funny or profound. He was simply brave. Maybe he had a nurturing, loving background, a happy childhood and it left his mind clear to chart out his goals with little or no conflict or self-sabotage. Humor often comes from a recipe containing some conflict and neurosis. I missed that complexity due, perhaps, to my own background. But you can't write in lines that just weren't there. Like the film 'Lincoln,' it was the historical moment that made the film almost easy to make.",7,0,0,23 April 2013
Knives Out," I think I found a flaw.
",I enjoyed the movie but was confused at the end. The vial labels are switched by Ransom. Somehow Marta realizes she's given the 'wrong med' to Mr. Thrombey. Does she know this because she somehow knows about the label switch? No. She simply didn't look at the vial carefully? No. Nurses always look carefully. And even if she made a once in a lifetime wrong med injection it wouldn't be on the exact same night that Ransom had made his label switch caper. Detective Blanc says she knew because she could tell the slight difference in the viscosity of the liquids to be injected (there were two). That can't be because it turns out she actually did give the harmless med after all and not the morphine. If she knew the labels were wrong due to the viscosity then she would have given the proper dose of morphine regardless of what the label said and therefor not gone into a panic. So what made her think she'd given an overdose of morphine? Am I the only one stuck here? Did I yawn and miss a crucial line?,7,2,7,3 January 2020
Shutter Island," Tricky Ending, Unrealistic Story And Ending
","The movie is unrealistic. What Institution would have had the money to produce a fake scenario with a cast of hundreds, numerous rehearsals and time taken from their regular jobs to convince one patient his fantasies were just that. They could and would have lobotomized him instead or simply kept him in solitary. Lobotomies were de reguer at that point in our history. Ditto for shock treatments. And according to the last scene this is the second time in a year that the whole facility has gone through this charade to try to 'wake' this guy up. Like I said, who's got the time and especially the money to devote to just this one patient? Never happen. Some of the scenes were intriguing. The actors were compelling in certain scenes. But the movie as a whole was a ridiculous and unrealistic film with the credo that, 'if we surprise you, (no matter how far-fetched), you'll like it.'",4,14,30,27 March 2010
Jackie," I was very moved by revisiting this tragic event but I wish they hadn't left out the drums.
","I DO remember where I was when I heard of JFK's assassination: sleeping in my dorm bed at University of California, my freshman year at Riverside, CA. Someone woke me up with the news. Seeing the events again brought back sadness. Seeing it from Jackie's perspective gave me a new respect for her. I have a vivid recollection of the march and the coffin. The drum unit followed with this incredible beat that I never forgot: thump - thump - thump - rolllllllllllllllllllll - thump - thump - thump - rollllllllllllllllllllll - thump - thump - thump - rolllllllllllllllllllll - thump - thump - thump/thump. I am a musician and that beat pattern has stayed with me for fifty-three years. So when they left the drumming out of the funeral march I was very disappointed. I wanted to yell out in the theater, 'They left out the drums!' Something told me that would have ruined the experience for most of the audience so I restrained that impulse. I wish Lee Oswald had shown a similar amount of control. (If he is the one -- I think I'll research that by reading, 'Ultimate Sacrifice' by Lamar Waldron and T Hartmann.)",8,0,1,7 February 2017
No Country for Old Men," Problems with the characters, problems with the ending
","I enjoyed watching this film. I enjoyed the realism and the unique characters of Lewellyn and Chigurh. But I was left rather angry by the way it ended. Why, after following the moves of the hunter and prey, do we get gypped out of seeing the denouement? Chigurh wins but we don't see it. And what about those other guys jumping into the truck? Why, after watching Lewellyn's wife face the killer, do we not get to see what he does? I'd have settled for a gunshot. No. After hearing her unique approach to the killers 'coin toss' gambit, we see him walk out without a sound from the house. Did the gambit work? OK, I have to guess, so I guess, no, it didn't. But why, after all the violence so far, do I have to guess on this one? Is it because the movie's almost over? That makes no sense.How is it that the hunter gets rammed by another vehicle at this particular time? Random chance? What are the odds? Films don't have events in them that are random. So what's the message? Just because it's a shock and I didn't expect it doesn't make it good storytelling. Also, why no 'portrait' of the other driver? We had scores of other portraits so why no portrait here? How did that driver come to be going so fast? Drugs? Rage? What? If it doesn't matter than why do the other events matter?Speaking of portraits what purpose does Sheriff Tommy Lee Jones serve? I kept thinking this seasoned old lawman was going to enter the scene at some point but he is terminally peripheral. He doesn't catch anyone. He doesn't even get a description of the killer from the trailer park superintendent because he never interviews her. He's just Falstaff in a Shakespeare play. Another blunder of his seems to be that he was in the same room with the killer and didn't know it (there in that last motel). All he had to do was turn on the rest of the lights. Or did I miss something? (Maybe this is a Patricia Highsmith type story where the villain gets away with it. I hate those kinds of stories.)How does the Woody Harrelson character add to the film? I get it that his presence fleshes out the ruthlessness of the killer and also the craftiness but that's somewhat undone by the easiness with which he's done away with. Shouldn't he have made his stand on the hotel stairs? Once inside the room he was a goner.And why, after being so wily up to the last reel, does Lewellyn show his cards to his wife knowing that the killer already has included her in the mix? And why does he not hide the money in a better spot having already used the air vent ploy? If nothing else, it guarantee's his life for a while if he doesn't have the money on him.Finally, I echo other reviewers at the low end who ask how none of this came to be followed by regular law officials? The killer leaves bodies behind like bread crumbs and no one is assigned to investigate? That's pretty hard to swallow.Nine years later I feel like changing one point. I understand Chigurh enough now to know he did kill Lewellen's wife. Her only chance, illogical as it was, was to correctly guess the flip of the coin. She didn't so he killed her. Is it a better movie that the Coen's left out the actual scene or sound of her execution? Not to me but I would entertain an opposite point of view. The car crash right after still makes no sense to the story. But now I'm anxious to read the novel from which this all came.",9,2,4,13 December 2007
Gone Girl," The Ending Ruined a Thriller I Was Completely Enjoying
","Spoilers for sure. This is for people who've already seen the film and who want to hear about other reactions to the ending. I think Pike's character would not have gotten away with killing her ex-lover and blaming him for her kidnapping. (Also, wouldn't the victims cameras have picked up on Pike's moves as she faked the rape using the spilled wine and wine bottle?) There's no proof his car was ever nearby, and no one seems to be curious enough about where the blood came from that was on her kitchen back home. Why weren't they curious about all the items in the shed that weren't used. Who buys golf clubs and never unwraps them? Other reviewers have talked about the half-hearted attempt to burn the diary. My problem, even if the police and FBI were incompetent about investigating her killing of her ex . . . . is why Afleck stays with her. She has no soul and he can't stand her. He's going to throw away the next eighteen years to be with this soulless maniac because she has used his sperm to impregnate herself? He's going to save the kid? Fat chance. That kid will be witness to one of the worst marriages in history. He will grow up with no evidence that families are a place where there is warmth and love. Good luck with that. And anyway, I just don't buy that Afleck's character could put up with her for that long. He hates her. He has her pegged as a sociopath. How can he throw his entire life away like that? I liked him up to that point. He had played his hand so well. Then Ffffffffffffffuf!",8,0,6,25 October 2014
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Many questions few answers
","Either film-goers are a totally different species than I or they ask a lot less of a film than I. I started off reading the book. (I'm in a book/film club where we do both and then discuss both together.) The book was a mere outline of a story not yet written. It just told events that happened with almost no dialog, expression of feelings, or even descriptions of where they were. It was a very short story and the facts were very different. His father denied his age and dressed him in shorts (he also kept custody which got changed in the film.) His wife came to resent him as did his teenage son. The movie went with the bare bones plot outline and wrote an entirely new story. What both had in common was that the characters didn't act like humans in the face of a scientific impossibility. They were shocked but that was the extent of it. No one contacted the media or the scientific community so that Man could study this 'miracle.' So the movie is now some sort of science fiction tale where people don't act like people yet in every other way they do. That inconsistency ruined both tales for me. I might have tried seeing it like one would GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, or Kafka's METAMORPHOSIS. But in those the goal was to share an insight and the unreality made the story fresh and helped drive the point home. The BUTTON twist did neither for me. And the love story made no sense to me, particularly when the Brad Pitt character leaves his wife (loving wife.) He didn't trust that her love for him was substantive enough (not superficial) to weather the onslaught of old age and sickness. She had the same affliction when she got injured in France--she hid from him and married someone else she didn't really love. Why? Because she was afraid she wasn't really loved for herself but for her looks and talent. Those aren't symptoms of love but impediments to it--it's not love if you start off thinking you're not really lovable for who you are inside. So I had no admiration for them as the relationship unfolded. Only in the end as he got really 'old,' did he allow her to love him and that didn't seem like a real choice but a result of him running out of options. I've read the laudatory comments and they do not resonate.",1,4,10,31 December 2009
Silence," Minority (Atheist) Report: A Fool's Errand
","This reaction to 'Silence' is from the perspective of an atheist. And my attitude throughout the film was influenced by my knowledge of the novel Shogun. In that book the Japanese were distrustful of European influence and infiltration. They knew or suspected that the first step towards outside dominance starts with the innocent-seeming proselytizers of 'the Word.' By today's view 'historians now describe missionaries as arrogant and rapacious imperialists. Christianity became not a saving grace but a monolithic and aggressive force that missionaries imposed upon defiant natives. Indeed, missionaries were now understood as important agents in the ever-expanding nation-state, or 'ideological shock troops for colonial invasion whose zealotry blinded them.' (Quoted from Google) The church gets mistreated or brutalized and the foreign country sends in the army. Some examples of this are South America: they all speak Spanish (or Portuguese) and are ruled by European descendants; Parts of Africa have the same history. There's India where it partly happened, and Australia. Perhaps Japan knew or suspected such an outcome as well. So I wasn't all that sympathetic to the two missionaries of this story. Plus their whole point of view was that they had the 'Truth'. There are thousands of religions that all claim the same thing. What makes the Western Christian version the REAL Truth? Nothing. It depends on where you were raised. That they all think they have the answer convinces me that none do. But it also convinces me that Man must invent some story, some explanation of why he's here, how he got here, and how he's supposed to act. I guess we'd be lost without such a backdrop. The other apes (chimpanzees, gorillas and such) don't seem to need that. Their 'God' is the alpha male of their band. For homo sapiens that would be a king but we seem to need more than that. So we have one who resides above the clouds. But the clouds are below us as well since the world is round so exactly where would we point to locate this Super King? You can't point everywhere so that's another reason why I'm convinced there is no Super King. All this makes the journey of Fathers Rodrigues and Garupe somewhat pathetic and somewhat tiresome. Missionaries remind me of Jehovah's Witnesses who go around (KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK) waking up nurses and other folks who work nights wanting to know, 'Can we come inside and pray with you?' ('Cuz we have the answer, the one and only answer.') I suppose this message was an improvement on cultures where there was out and out cannibalism but beyond that it was and is an intrusion. Still, the torture and murder was extreme and hard to watch. But one reviewer pointed out that Scorsese neglected to show that in Spain and Portugal at that very time there was an Inquisition going on with equal cruelty and murder towards Jews and Protestants. I therefore celebrated the entrance of the former Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson). He took righteousness out of the equation and just tried to fulfill a need he saw. And he seemed to come by that wisdom the hard way – discovering that nothing else worked or made any sense. So I liked the outcome reached by Father Rodrigues. Just as an afterthought, did anyone besides me notice that all that praying brought about no results, except internally (and then only in certain cases)? Did anyone else get the idea that no one is listening? Anyway, I loved the ocean post card scenery. And I liked being plopped down in an earlier time in history. I liked the film somehow.",10,6,14,23 January 2017
Into the Wild," Fit my taste exactly
","I read the book and liked it. And the movie was true to the book. (Movie even better in some tiny ways). I note that reviewers feel about this film more or less the way they feel about its subject, Chris McCandless. The judgments range from spoiled/ingrate to tragic hero. Most are personalizing the film based on their own histories regarding parental anger and forgiveness. I certainly did with my narcissistic doctor father. Editorial note: Some people repress their parental anger--even to the point of not allowing it to come to the surface at all. The rage stays hidden and what you see is their fear when someone else 'indulges' theirs. I now see McCandless as having lived a fruitful life albeit a dangerous one. Danger-lovers have fuller lives, perhaps, but they 'takes their chances.' McCandless IS a hero, however, in the sense that he was 'out there'--he wanted truth or nothing.",10,2,6,11 December 2007
Avatar," Homo Sapiens and Greed
","I was very moved by this film. I saw it as an allegory of what the whites did to the natives in North America, South America, Australia, New Zea land and Tasmania (especially there)--almost complete genocide for the sake of monetary profit by corporate magnates. And since corporations are the real power in developed countries: they have carte blanche to kill as needed. They usually are clever in creating a body of lies that help to dehumanize the victims. (Easier to kill 'em).The way to drive such a principle home, which means into the heart AND the head, is to show both sides. So we see the natives, Navi, in their culture which includes art, mythology, dance, music, and meaningful rituals. You can come to love any culture (even white European) if you are exposed to this side of humans. And in so doing, it would become horrible to wipe them out for the sake of a fat bank account back home. That is what Cameron does. He gets you on the side of the humanity, in this case, the Navi. (We already know about the dark side of homo Sapiens but it is well sketched in here by the mercenary grunts. I think DANCES WITH WOLVES tells much the same story. There the corporate element stays in the background which was OK for that film.I was like a little boy visiting a heaven-like world with 'people' who were conscious of other things besides money and power. In the back of my mind I wondered that any race could be that harmonious. North American 'Indians' treated other tribes horribly in most areas like on the the Plains and conducted raids and wars where there was much cruelty. (See the film THE BLACK ROBE, for a New England version of this.) Were the Navi like that? And what if they were? I guess the question is greed. Given the means would some Navi have exterminated other tribes and gotten rich? They didn't seem to need to be rich.So are all intelligent bipedal creatures alike? I once heard a theory about why there are no space travelers from beyond--if they became as intelligent as we, they'd also encounter the same jealousies and greed that we have, thus preventing them from combining their resources and cooperating--the infighting would bar them from space travel.A wonderful epic film. The love story was poetic. The creatures were beautiful and scary. So were the plants. The hero started off a klutz but grew on me. And I liked hearing Wes Studi's voice again. He was the 'bad' Indian in DANCES as he was in LAST OF THE MAHICANS.",10,7,14,31 December 2009
Con Air," The beginning ruined it all for me.
",The movie opens with Nicholas Cage's character defending himself against three guys in a fight in a parking lot. They begin to beat him badly. He starts to get the upper hand and when one guy attempts to kill him with a knife he grabs the knife and stabs the guy. Isn't that self defense? What kind of lawyer can't get a guy off who is just defending himself from being murdered? What kind of DA would even take that case to trial? The premise that Cage goes to jail for four years on a manslaughter charge is preposterous. He's a war hero. He did nothing wrong. I found it impossible to watch the rest of the movie after seeing that.,2,2,5,19 November 2014
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Quirky and Confusing
","I gave this film three stars because its wit broke through here and there. But the dialog was written to shock for the sake of shocking. And the highbrow language of real estate and status symbols was aimed at who? Adults with MBA's? So I was chuckling but was also uncomfortable at the same time--who was making me laugh? A fox or a 'human' looking like a fox? He was dressed like a fox, liked to steal chickens, but settled down as a newspaper columnist. Where was the society that supported and craved daily news on the printed page? Actually, that part was put forth halfheartedly.I mean was there an animal society with culture and stuff or not? Even if there was Mr Fox didn't really suit that life. If the narrator in 'Marley and Me' was a columnist, or the narrator in 'The Soloist,' then this guy was a sham, a farce. He had no interest in his trade . . . none. Yet his family duties demanded that he stay legit and not 'break the law.' He dare not get sent to prison or be killed. The roles confused me here. (Maybe reading the book would clear it up.) Is he right to take up stealing again or wrong? Stealing is in his blood, you can tell that but the tightrope between getting the adrenaline rush and risking the safety of his family and neighbors is confusing. He and the story keep demonstrating inconsistencies.What I'm saying is that it was hard for me to know who to root for. He kept succeeding until his overconfidence got him busted. His relationship with his son was dysfunctional. It was almost painful to hear the lines from his son. They were quite realistically written complete with veiled hostility, appeals for encouragement and flat out statements of inadequacy. Was that supposed to be funny?Finally, the whole issue of stealing was schizophrenic. Foxes don't steal in the human sense. They hunt for available food. Their aim is to get food but not die trying. Many a fox has made the fatal mistake of hunting Man's flocks because of diminishing natural habitat or the laziness of old age. Here the issue is more like a cartoon scenario like Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. But wouldn't the Bugs Bunny saga be more of a downer if we witnessed Fudd wipe out Bug's entire home environment and endanger his kids and cause Bugs to feel guilty for what used to be fun? And feel guilty because Fudd was coming close to ending the entire cartoon? You'd have worry creep in where there used to be only humor. Your laughter would change from a series of guffaws to intermittent giggles. For me, some of those giggles were from embarrassment . . . like when someone's bombing on stage.I think the film suffered from the writers not knowing what kind of film they were going for--they seemed to opt for what cracked them up that moment as they sat around the writing table.",3,12,29,13 December 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," One Long Car Chase But Entertaining Nonetheless
","I enjoyed this movie. It was non-stop action but the action was really well done. They kept out-doing themselves with how many ways they could bring down or blow up the opposing vehicle. And for some reason, I cared about Charlize's character as well as Max. The bad guys' costumes were so bazaar they added to the fun. The bad guy leader . . . . didn't he ever get too hot for that getup? But while watching I did have a problem with how their situation could exist: 1. There were two scenes where they gave the thirsty crowd water. They used the most inefficient method: they dumped it onto the folks nearest the cliff and wasted about 98% of it. Why? I know. For show. 2. Did they ever eat? I never saw food or anyone eating. (Except for one guy eating a bug.) 3. How did they manage to keep all those vehicles running? Gas. Where did the gasoline come from? You need a refinery for that. And auto parts. Who made those? Those monster truck tires cost about $2000 a piece. Where did the money come from? Where did the tires come from? I know, it's just entertainment. It doesn't matter. It was Hollywood. True but I enjoyed noticing all the inconsistencies.",7,2,8,26 July 2015
Law Abiding Citizen," The reviews said it would be better.
","This film had some exciting moments and a good premise. But in the end, It seemed to start off high concept: prisoner holds all the cards. But Butler's character dissolves into a monster not unlike Darby, the guy who killed his wife and kid.First of all, why did the Assist. DA, Foxx, take Darby's testimony to hang Ames? Darby was the doer and Ames the tag along. That's a game changing mistake right there. If the Foxx character had done it the reverse way Butler's character wouldn't have been so justifiably worked up; the true killer would have gotten the joy juice. You can't tell me Ames was too loyal to turn states evidence. So the whole movie needs a ridiculous set of facts to be set in motion. But accepting that for arguments sake, the movie presents a promising scenario -- a man who is so good at taking the law into his own hands that he can call the shots. But then the movie turns crazy. Why does Butler shun bail? So he can wage war on the city justice department? OK, but he could have done that easier on the outside. True, doing it from the outside wouldn't have made Foxx's character look so idiotic but it would have made Butler more believable, less reckless and out of control. Instead he starts to kill innocent people from within, like his cell-mate and Foxx's assistants. It is now a lot harder to like this guy. He's mostly on a power trip--one designed to rub everyone's faces in their own sh*t. What high moral principle does that champion? After many more deaths of people who only vaguely helped to execute the wrong guy, Butler hears Foxx's last appeal for reason. The audience is mostly seeing it his way, i.e. enough is enough. But Butler can't get out of his own obsessive sickness. So killing him was more or less logical. Butler had morphed into a pitiful joke compared to his original goals. Did the movie really want us to jump back onto Foxx's side? I wasn't comfortable with that. I felt disappointed. There was no real point to the film then.I'll take Dexter over this guy any day. Dex never takes out the innocents. And his code only covers true destroyers of life who have no chance of ever rehabbing. And he does it all anonymously--the vigilante lives to fight another day.Afterword: I've been a bit dishonest here. I was actually rooting for the Butler character to blow up city hall. I guess it was the logic of the film that I'd bought into. Now I see that there are two sides to me--a peaceful citizen and an enraged maniac. I disowned the maniac the minute the movie ended.",5,2,4,31 October 2009
