Come and See," Real war...
","When I saw this movie I was shocked from all the horrible images I saw of what kind of things happened in White Russia during World War 2. Its a very strong movie, and very beautifully shot. This movie is the ultimate anti war Film. When you see this film, I promise you that you will never want to join the army and go to war. The film has very powerful and strong images, that touch you and really make you feel for the people and the protagonist in this film. there is one part of this movie that almost makes your heart stop completely, you are so focused on what is going on, and you don't even believe your eyes. This moment for me is pure art of cinema, the director did a great job of expressing all these fellings and emotions. To fully understand what I mean, a person has to see this great film.",8,2,2,18 December 2010
