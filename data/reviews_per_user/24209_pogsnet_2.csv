The Sound of Music," The Best Movie Ever Made!
","Simply all the best! From scenes, scripts (line per line), music, and story.This movie has a excellent blend on everything. Good romance movie for general ages.You can learn a lot from this movie. I love the twist on the story, I'm sure you gonna love it too. It a kind of movie to watch over and over again, where no time can make it obsolete. It's like a classical song that has no season, where you can play anytime and anywhere.As you watch the movie, it is not just about romance, or about music, or about running a big family, but somehow you will see how a well known family can be displaced from a war. The point is there are lots of aspect for your point of view.Highly Recommended to watch! I think A must have DVD copy.",10,1,7,3 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Very Good Movie!
","I am a Die Hard fan. This version of the Die Hard uses computer technology of the present or somewhat a little future a very different twist.Comparing them with other Die Hard movies, well, it maybe not exceed to the expectations of Die Hard 3. Die Hard 3 is full of action, while here is about technology twist, don't need much action. I consider Die Hard 3 the best action packed among them if thats what you are looking for a movie.Flaws? Yes I see a lot. Number 1, in the apartment of his son, very unrealistic, considering about the bomb...when it blows up the whole house of the other hacker, why not the whole room in the apartment? and A lot more to mention.Overall, this is very good as a Die Hard movie 9/10 rating to me.",9,0,1,3 November 2007
