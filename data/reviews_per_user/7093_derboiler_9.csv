Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Much ado about nothing...
","...is the title of a Shakespearian comedy. This movie reflects it. There's a lot of blabla but without any deeper meaning. It is Tarantino style dialogue which is meant to sound cool. The only problem is that there's too much of it. This movie lacks of everything the first movie had: Suspense, good action and interesting ideas like i.e. the anime part. On the other hand it has everything the first didn't need: Lots of gibberish dialogue which prolongs the movie endlessly. It all would have been a great 3 hour movie if u packed the first and second part together. If you get to rent the dvd I would recommend watching the deleted scene. This scene contains what everybody was waiting for and what Kill Bill Vol.2 should have been like.I gave the first part a 10/10. The second part gets only 5/10. Mildly entertaining. derboiler.",1,28,57,18 August 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," YAWN - disappointing
",There is only one thing to be said about that movie: Disappointing. I mean really loved the first one and watched it several times. The problem is: The story is told in one phrase but the movie goes on for about 2 hours. In part1 that wasn't a real problem because the movie was fully action packed and full of interesting passages (i.e. the anime part) This is completely missing in the second part. Some easy going action scenes and the rest is gibberish dialogue for about 100 minutes - YAWN. Very sad I really liked the first part a lot. The second is a throwaway and pure waste of time.,1,8,15,21 October 2004
Underworld," Boring Gunfights in a dark movie
",I personally like the dark style of that movie. What bored me was the loveless gunfights. And the missing suspense. It seems to me that this movie tries to mix Interview with a vampire with Blade. Well it doesn't succeed. Neither the characters and the plot are well developed nor the action scenes well choreographed ( apart of the end fight).  And this for about 2 hours... If you have really nothing else to do and if you love dark movies then this might be for you. 5 of 10.,5,0,0,27 December 2003
Dawn of the Dead," Really boring...
",Just don't bother. I thought I would see a movie with great supspense and action.But it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start. In the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed. Towards the end the it gets better but not really great. I think the director took this movie just too serious. In such a kind of a movie even if u don't care about the plot at least you want some nice action. I nearly dozed off in the middle/main part of it. Rating 3/10.derboiler.,1,2,9,29 April 2004
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Highly overrated movie for kids
",Oh my gosh- this movie is really totally overrated. I haven't read the books so I can only talk about the movie. First of all it looks like a children's tale which tries to have a bit from Lord of the Rings. It naturally fails completely. The characters are very flat and don't have any substance. The plot itself seemed to be a fast forward version of its original story. That's the only thing I can think of. I really doubt the books are that flat and badly written. As the film is moving very fast to the final battle it looses any bit of atmosphere that might have been created in the beginning. To see these kids swing around swords and fighting in a life or death battle is very dull. I could go some steps further but this would spoil the film. If there is something to spoil at all...What might be interesting?Nicely animated fantasy figures A story which is more for kids than adults Beware that there still exist some fighting scenes which may not be suitable for small kids.Result:As a movie for children I would give it a 5 but as an adult which has certain expectations of a fantasy movie I can only give it 3/10 points. Very disappointing.,3,1,2,9 January 2006
Lost in Translation," A documentary is more entertaining...
","Jesus! I can't believe this movie has been rated so high! The story is entirely boring, acting is ok locations are boring as well(and this in Japan!). A man in midlife crises,  a woman with a wrecked relationship meet each other in Japan and try do to something entertaining together. Wow that's a plot! Yehaah! The dialogs are so boring that me and my girlfriend were bored after the first ten minutes or so. I thought it would be a comedy not a depressing drama after all. I wanted to see something more of the culture or learn something from that movie. But you do better and watch a documentary because this will be a lot more fun and thrilling. Guess what? You maybe even learn something from it.. Really bad movie I give 1/10 sry.",1,10,22,21 January 2004
Watchmen," Even a disappointment to a fan of comics and 300
",First I have to say I love comic books. I read them my entire life and still do. In general I'm always interested in watching movies that are based on comic books. Since I really like the style of 300 I thought why not giving this movie a try and watch Watchmen?This is what I have to say about the movie: The plot was interesting since it had a nice twist and turn of events. I didn't read the comic book from Alan Moore before because I wanted to be surprised by the plot. I was surprised but not in a good way...Story: That said I criticize the way of telling the story. There are way too much diversions misleading the viewer from the main plot. After a while this turns out to be tiring and you get to feel the lengths of it. Zack Snyder seemed to feel the same way as he threw in some violence here and there. Perhaps to shake and wake you up anew. No prob with violence if it does make sense (like in the epic battle of 300 for example). But here it seemed really more to give the viewer a quick shock to stay focused.Action parts: I like the quickness of the action scenes. It really remembers the camera movement from 300 and also the in-Action-Slow-Motion. So the action part looks good. I didn't enjoy the music in these scenes since the music takes a bit away the thrilling part of it. Watch the opening scene with the battle of the comedian to see what I mean.Style: Hmmm here this really is a matter of taste. I didn't enjoy the costume design. Some but not all of them. It looked too much popcorn alike. I much more prefer the darker style like in Batman the dark night. All in all it's not a bad movie but because of the mentioned points a was disappointed. So what is cool about it? I liked the casting. The actors fit their roles well. I also enjoyed the short action-scenes but be prepared there is not a lot of it in that movie... What else? Good camera-work and CGI as expected. My personal opinion 6/10,6,0,6,26 March 2009
National Treasure," below average
","I didn't have great expectations when I was talked intogoing to watch this film. But the film managed to still disappoint and fail me in every point. Well what do you expect from such a movie? 1.)Half way interesting characters (No since long time ago I do not expect another Indiana Jones cause there was only H. Ford to play him)2.)Mildy interesting plot 3.)Good acting1) Characters No one standing out. The character design is very boring.Nothing deep or special to the guys. Even the bad guy isn't an interesting character. 2) Plot When I go into the cinema I don't want to see half of the movie been told about bad guy that chases the good guy. I want more mysteries more fascinating stuff about the main secret. And finally an answer that is satisfying and not so plump. 3) Acting Average performance of Nicholas Cage and the rest well ... No smart guys, nobody outstanding. Looks like 'oh let us finish the job and move on to a more interesting movie'Resume: The movie looses more and more credibility- I don't want to explain it here since it would spoil the movie- as the plot unfolds. Since there is no good storyline neither good acting this movie is not even worth the rent. And I have to say I really love the Indiana Movies. So basically I like the genre but not if it is wasted like in that movie... 1/10 awful",1,6,11,15 December 2004
The Descent," Dumb and Dumber characters
",I think that movie isn't too bad but there is way too much hype around that flick. What annoys me is what you already have read from the title I gave this comment. The characters are behaving like in usual horror movies: First do then think. Not the other way around. So often the stupidity of the girls made me laugh instead of having pity. That fact is really taking away the suspense. The predators reminded me the reapers from Blade 2. They add what u need to produce an average horror movie. Some gory scenes like bones sticking out of the body and some flesh eating are used to frighten people. So what's good? I liked the camera shots and sounds in this movie. You get some interesting angles and camera shots of the cave and at the beginning some nice nature scenes. All in all you can watch this movie if you got nothing else at hand and if you do not have too high expectations.5/10 Stars,1,7,15,2 January 2006
