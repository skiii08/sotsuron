The King's Speech," the royal voice that shakes
","Tom Hooper has delivered a masterful display here. There's no questions that this piece of art is worth for all these Oscars and other accommodations that it has won. Made just for under 20 million, it became a worldwide hit. And that's a big achievement for purely British movie. I have to admit, my expectations were sky-high and it didn't live up to that hype, but I still enjoyed it though. I wasn't aware of King George VI's life that he was a stammer which gave the basic to that a good inspiring story. Now I know that and I suggest others to be known about that too.Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are the best part of the movie. Perfect for the roles and they are worth their nominations. It's hard to realize that Firth is not actually a stammerer. An Oscar for that is what I call job well done.I think almost everyone has had a moment when they are to speak in front of some size of audience and then they just can't say the words. That's called out of words. Welcome to King George VI's world.",8,2,3,18 May 2011
Black Swan," two sides
","Director Darren Aronofsky is truly one of a kind. He has directed another winner. For me, Black Swan is his best. I gotta tell you, this movie is really something. It's pretty hard to pass down all that what I just saw. It's so intense, so thrilling, so gripping. I mean, there's no point to look any information about this movie. Just go see it. Like a breath of fresh air. It plays with your mind at the highest level and in the end, gives you a great satisfaction. This one is surely one of the films of the year. A certain nominee for Oscars.Natalie Portman is my cherry on top of the cake here. Whether it's a comedy, a drama, a thriller, she always wins my heart. So cute and so likable. She shines throughout the movie. I knew she's great, she proved that again. Mila Kunis was a big surprise. I felt like I was loving two women on the screen same time. Oh man, she was so hot. But not only sexy, she gave a great performance as well. Vincent Cassel seemed like he is not an actor. More like a real life artistic director.The movie makes you think how hard it is to live in the frames. When you finally are able to get out of these frames, you could be a different person. Like your other side comes up and takes over. This a a mind stuff.",10,2,5,15 January 2011
Walk the Line," love is a burning thing
","Johnny Cash's music is truly unique. That legendary man will always be membered by as the one the greatest country singers ever. Johnny Cash's life was full of success. It was marred by personal problems such as drinking, drug addiction and unstability. Nevertheless, it doesn't reduce the influence he has had to the country music. Walk The Line follows John's life through tough childhood to the frenzied success all over the America. The film focuses mainly to his relationship with his beloved singer June. James Mangold does a great job here. This is just not a movie which circles around the love relationship. It still has space for music. The movie offers some great on-stage music performances. Joaquin Phoenix (Johnny) and Reese Witherspoon (June) does have a great match here. It works well.The man who sang that love is burning thing, really knew what he was singing about. Johnny Cash walked the line almost entire his life. His music is called classic nowadays. Watch the movie and listen to the music and you may get it.",8,0,0,3 January 2011
Lucky Number Slevin," bad dog
",Wow! Impressive stuff. Wasn't expecting something like that. Totally gripping movie. Perfect story with some twists you certainly don't expect. In the end gives you even more straws to pick. Watching this movie is like doing something that you really love to do. It gives you satisfaction. I'm not gonna open the script for you here. I just suggest to see that as soon as possible. You may be surprised of what you have been missed.Bruce Willis was the coolest of the bunch. Josh Hartnett was the biggest astonishment. Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley are on top form. This cast makes this movie even stronger.Every dog has its own day. See that and you know what I mean. Powerful emotions guaranteed.,10,5,6,27 January 2011
Requiem for a Dream," addiction
","Director Darren Aronofsky is really one of a kind. His films are the ones people are looking forward to see since Requiem For a Dream. And there's a reason for that. Requiem For a Dream is a brutal film. It's brutal because of the subject it handles which is drugs and addiction. It's also brutal how seriously and honestly it has shown to the viewers. It may shock more vulnerable people. It's a good drama still. It's a pressure-cooker so you may need extra focus to see that movie and get the point.Well, what about cast? Ellen Burstyn is Oscar-nom, Jennifer Connelly is cute. Obviously the only serious role played in Marlon Wayans acting career, but he's OK. Jared Leto is one of my favorite musicians and he is getting my nod here as well.I suggest to see this movie. It may say that, it's actually necessary to see for some guys. It's a little bit creepy but powerful.",8,1,2,3 January 2011
Stop-Loss," i see talent
","Stop-Loss is quite a controversial movie. It's not your regular war movie. It has few scenes which the story happens in Iraq, but mainly it goes in US where the soldiers have returned from the mission. They are trying to conflate back to civilian life which actually seems harder than going through battles back in the far east. It's intriguing because the movie has a point against the government system which has a fail spot. But for me, what I really enjoyed, was the story more important than the vital factor for which the movie wanted to point the finger to.I liked the cast. Young and talented actors such as Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt give all good performances. And also we got good-looking Abbie Cornish. Stand-out performance - Joseph Gordon-Levitt.I suggest to see the movie because of its talent. You see the future and probably you like it.",8,0,0,5 June 2011
Fight Club," one of the best
","This movie is one the best ever. When you are going to see this, it may confuse you. But that's what I really enjoy about this movie. It's confusing in strange ways and makes up many questions but keeps your mind intense and focused at the same time. It's so fascinating.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are a great combo here. A terrific match-up. I really like the bewildering intelligence Tyler (Brad Pitt) uses, to express himself. The Narrator (Edward Norton) develops his role extremely well too. In addition, the soundtrack of the movie is really cool.This movie is a must see. It blows you away. A jaw-dropping stuff!",10,2,4,1 January 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's point of view
","Quentin Tarantino is truly one of a kind. His well-known earmarks are always fun to watch. I think it's phenomenal how he can make films which are so full of personality and quality - brilliant performances, epic quotes, satisfaction. Inglorious Basterds had been waited for some time and I gotta tell you, it absolutely delivered. I thought it might be good, a real shooter. What I didn't think was that it would make a list to my elite films. It was a surprise at times, but when I think now, it isn't. Why? Because it's Tarantino's. You just know you get great stuff.Obviously, it is Christoph Waltz in the role of Col. Hans Landa, to whom all the applauds are going to. His performance is second to none. But I wouldn't underrate Brad Pitt's role as Lt. Aldo Raine. Terrific actor, extremely versatile.Believe me, Quentin Tarantino gives a new look to the WWII. It may like you, it may not. It probably does. In the end, it's your call. I arrant enjoy it. I thought it was a work by a genius. Well done.",10,4,9,20 April 2011
The Girl Next Door," squeeze the juice
","The Girl Next Door is a perfect film for the movie night. It's fun, entertaining. It's not that serious, but at the same time it has a point. And I liked a plot a lot. Quite original in my opinion. Credit to director Luke Greenfield for not letting this one to go too out of hands by putting in some intense scenes as well. It's a top notch entertainment.Young actors Emile Hirsch and Paul Dano look very young here. They do fine, especially Hirsch by developing his character. But it is Elisha Cuthbert who steals every minute of the screen. Arguably one of the hottest characters. Her sexiness is irresistible. Jeez, burns like a fire.There is definitely something instructional in this movie. It is summed up nicely in this metaphor used in the movie: 'you got to know whether the juice is worth to squeeze or not.' So squeeze whenever you can. I prefer orange juice.",9,2,2,17 January 2011
127 Hours," 1 1/2 hours
","127 Hours is truly unique movie. I have waited for it some time. Now I have finally seen it. I didn't have to disappoint. I usually don't watch trailers and I must say the film was exactly what I pictured it. Still I liked it very much though. It gives you gripping view of one of the ultimate true story survivors. It has some really ghastly scenes but it made the movie more real. You don't see that kinda stuff often, so it's definitely worth a look. James Franco (Aron Ralston) gives his greatest performance ever. This is by far the best acting he has done. A certain Oscar nominee at least.Aron Ralston spent 127 hours stuck in the fault line. You can get that experience with less than an hour and a half. Take that chance. You'll still be fine after that.",8,1,4,23 January 2011
500 Days of Summer," (500) reasons to see this movie
","OK, I'm not going to give you 500 reasons why you should see this one. But I give you some points that you could think about whether to see it. The first one would be you have never ever seen a movie like that. I mean, you probably have seen (or been in) a similar love story, but the storytelling here is fascinating. Truly one of a kind. I mean, a boy falls for a girl, a girl doesn't, what are the odds? If you don't have a clue, definitely see this one. If you have any thoughts, see, so you can be sure. Haha, it's a win-win situation for you. Unfortunately not for this young fella and his charming chick.Believe me, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is actually playing a pretty decent guy here. Well, he can't accept, that there is no love at first sight at every case, but that is normal I guess. Zooey Deschanel is a beauty. A beauty with an attitude. What more can you ask?Warning, this movie is not good to watch with your girlfriend if you guys are having some kind of crow to pick. This may give your relationship a push you might not want. Still, I entirely enjoyed it. Pretty sure, you too.",8,0,1,15 February 2011
The Expendables," don't need a script for those fellas
","I knew exactly what to expect from this movie. Only one thing. And it's called loads-of action. I didn't had to disappoint. If you don't draw yourself a massive expectations, you don't have to regret later. I think that whats many people did and they were left disappointed in the end. There were some great fighting scenes and some good chase scenes. Special effects were quite top-class.If you have Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Rourke, Couture, Crews, Austin, Schwarzenegger, Willis in the same movie, you don't need a even a good screenplay. They deliver with their bossy quotes and pretty good fighting skills. Or like Terry Crews showed in the end, with a m60 machine gun in his hands.",7,2,4,3 January 2011
The Town," Boston is The Town
","I have to admit, Ben Affleck has done a tremendous job here. Writing, directing and playing a lead character is not easy to do if you are not Clint Eastwood or Robert Redford. For me, his stocks have arisen after seeing this movie. I already kinda expect what he is coming up next.I liked the movie mainly for few things. First, it's a great entertainment. It has good chase scenes. The bank robbery scenes were also great. Some of the dialogues are quite intense. I mean, whatever you expect from a great action-movie, you'll find it here.Boston is the town. In my opinion, one the most fascinating cities of US. It's not because I fancy Celtics or Red Sox to other sports clubs, it's more because the movies have shown it as a very mysterious and interesting city. It's something that you see and you'll immediately know that you wanna go there.",8,1,2,3 January 2011
Closer," look closer
","I have seen this movie quite a lot of times now. I can see myself watching it again and again. This movie is so powerful. An unique movie on its own way. It gives a viewer to create its own picture how things have developed between the scenes cause almost each scene is partitioned by some set of time.The cast is superb. Julia Roberts is very beautiful. Jude Law looks like a classic self-searching young Englishman. Clive Owen was awesome because of his macho-image. But all my love goes to Natalie Portman. She is so cute, sexy and confident. You gotta love Natalie. I believe her smile makes everybody smile.The tagline for the movie tells it all. If you believe in love at first sight, look closer.",10,2,3,30 December 2010
Forrest Gump," story of a lifetime
","Forrest Gump is possibly one the greatest movies of all-time. Like many people, I have seen it many times. Like many others, the famous quotes from the movie are installed in my brain. Like many others, I deem this as one of my favorites movies ever. Why is it so good? Many good reasons. One for sure is the natural entity of Forrest. He may seem a dumb guy who can't think 'logically' but he has a good heart. He has a good intentions and people recognize that. People love to see someone who has an ability to look by all the bad events which happen in the life. Forrest brings that kind of peace and aplomb which people need in their life. People need to have hope. And Forrest shows that if there's an attitude, there is always hope for good things. Good things happen to good people.Tom Hanks is one the best actors. His peak was in 90's and this is his masterpiece. He'll be always remembered as Forrest Gump. He is perfect for the role and a worthy Oscar winner. His character is so likable that people care about him immediately. The supporting cast is also memorable. Great performances by Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, Robin Wright and Sally Field.The life of Forrest Gump is fascinating. He did things that made people love him. Not to express sympathy for him, but truly look up to him. It is a story of a lifetime. A story that moves anybody who believe in good things. A compelling, touchy and emotional movie. Forrest says that life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you gonna get. Pick a candy. It's probably delicious.",10,1,2,12 January 2011
The Godfather: Part II," from father to son
","It is by far the greatest sequel ever made to a movie. Francis Ford Coppola has a hit jackpot yet again. The first film of the Mario Puzo's trilogy was a great one. Some agree, some disagree, but in my opinion, part II was even slightly better. The movie is full of same style and originality that the first film. It works for mafia film. There has been done tremendous job on set designing. Especially on scenes which portray life of Vito Corleone at early 20's in New York. That's a wonderful piece of work. You could have no complaints at all. The screenplay is good. It shows how Vito Corleone started his family business, later called mafia. On the other hand, it follows life of his son Michael who tries to enlarge family business to Las Vegas and Havana.Although there is no original Godfather (Marlon Brando), his son Michael (Al Pacino) shines. That's a statement act which became cornerstone in his career. So cool and fearless, like his father. Al Pacino is a deserved Oscar-winner here. This is the top of the mafia films. It would be very hard to go higher here, presumably only down.",8,0,3,3 January 2011
The Machinist," a twister
","What I really enjoy about movies is in this film. A twisted tale that keeps your mind focused and gives different ideas where the story might go. So intense. A real pleasure to see. Except Christian Bale (Trevor Reznik), who is phenomenal, but not so good to see. He weighs about 120 pounds and looks like an human skeleton. But he is the king of the castle here. Absolutely steals the whole show. His greatest performance by a clear mile. In my opinion, very underrated.All the distractions should be removed when you see this one. It would be better if the lights are off. You get that cold chill through your body, I guarantee. It's a thrilling experience. I utterly enjoyed it. There's no better scenes in movies than an unexpected twists that turn the whole picture upside down.",9,1,1,27 January 2011
No Strings Attached," Kelso won the heart of my golden girl
","First of all, I have to say that this movie is sexy and funny. But these are not the main reasons why you should see this. Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman are the reason. Especially the latter. For me, Natalie Portman is the best actress around. I absolutely love her. Ashton Kutcher is one the best comedian and charismatic actors around. He is confident, good-looking and -talking, so it's a near perfect match. Although the subject in the movie is very much about sex, we actually see few scenes of actual sex on screen. But it doesn't decrease the value of the movie. What can I say is that, if there would be any other two stars on the screen, the movie would get a lower rating from me, but as I said, they have picked the best bits.Ashton Kutcher will almost certainly be remembered as Michael Kelso from the famous TV-series. A great character. And it's nice to see that he has an excellent taste for women.",8,1,3,18 June 2011
No Country for Old Men," men's country
","No Country For Old Men is one the best I have seen from Coen brothers. I liked their O Brother Where Art Thou but I disliked Fargo. Well, I gotta tell you, it's like a day and night with Fargo. The movie is an extremely creepy. A very haunting tale. There's something very gripping about this one. I think girls won't find it interesting that much. It's more like a guys territory. Boys enjoy it. Plenty of cool chase scenes and some awesome action ones which has a touch of Coen' power in it.The trio is fantastic. Javier Bardem, in his own words, is out of his comfort zone, but he delivers. A scary performance by him. Well, Tommy Lee Jones for that, is totally in his comfort zone. Josh Brolin with his mustache is good too.This movie is about men's country. Men rule and shape this country. How? See and maybe you get the answer.",8,4,6,18 January 2011
Batman Begins," batman began
","One of the best comics book characters ever. Batman is my favorite fictional super hero. And mix him with one the best young directors of our time. And now you get the result which is awesome. I truly mean it. This film is really good. You may know the story or predict easily how it goes but it doesn't matter. It fully grips you. Offers you first- class fictional entertainment by a rich man turned to a giant bat. What else can you wish?Nolan has done a tremendous job with the cast. For me, Michael Keaton stays for the best Batman ever, but Christian Bale comes close to him. Well, Bale surely is better fighter. I liked him more when he was wearing the bat costume. Katie Holmes is cute, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are in their elements. It's a good supporting cast.Credit to Nolan for taking up a challenge like this. After all the previous Batman films, how can you make a new Batman film from the beginning? Well, this is how. It's worth to see.",9,0,0,17 January 2011
Saving Private Ryan," spielberg's masterpiece
","Spielberg is well-known for his big films. Saving Private Ryan is his best of the bunch by a clear mile. It is a statement in the genre of war movies. An absolute top. I'm an huge fan of war movies and this one is in my top 3 for sure. I like that there's a great piece of an human side in this movie. It's quite touching. It makes it powerful.Tom Hanks was one the best actors of the 90's. He capped the decade off with one the strongest performances of his career. He shows here why he is Spielberg's favorite actor. He has lots of talent around him. Most notably Edward Burns and Barry Pepper, a must-be guy in war movies. But others like Matt Damon, Vin Diesel and Tom Sizemore leave the mark too.War movies are good when they seem realistic. This one for sure is. A classic and a must-see in war genre. A masterpiece by one the most acknowledged directors of our time. Watch alone or with friends, does not matter, you get the point.",10,1,2,5 January 2011
Revolutionary Road," revolutionary road is a street
","I like dramas. Good dramas make me smile because obviously they're so fascinating to see. But this one here, I don't know. It didn't achieve its purpose. It was like a tragedy. The more to the ending, the more story got depressing. But when I shun that, the movie itself was built really well. Storytelling was quite good one. This picture takes place in 50's, so the art-direction for the movie is very auspicious. There have been done some remarkable job.Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors. Leo and Kate Winslet haven't been in a same movie since Titanic back in 97'. Their reunion for this frustrating movie is the best outcome from it. They both give good performances, but as you could guess, there's no great destiny here for them too. Some couples just look good, but it doesn't mean they last forever.Leo and Kate live in a nice white house which is located in Revolutionary Road. At first, I thought the title means the 'road' a young couple are going through, but I was way wrong. It's actually just a street name. But revolutionary for sure.",6,0,1,9 March 2011
2012," you are warned
","I saw this movie in cinema. I believe if I'd had to see that on TV, it would have been ten times worse. Still, it does not matter. This is so awful. OK, there are possibly used almost every special effect available nowadays. Quite large number of special effects were actually pretty good. But why is it still so awful? Let me tell you, it's just so stupid. The way the main characters always get away at the last second, while everything destroys around them, is just too much 'oh-my-god-how-lucky' stuff. But the worst thing is the out of nowhere taken so called 'jokes'. These weren't even close to funny. Totally out of context. Like you drink hot tea while you are in the beach on a sunny day. It just don't match.The acting is horrible here. Why, John Cusack? You're much better than this crap. I just say that you are warned. Avoid 2012. Not the year, but the movie. I'm sure it's gonna be an awesome year.",1,0,2,6 January 2011
The Mist," something for the night
","Stephen King is well-known for his novels. And most of his novels are so great that screenwriters run a storm to their rights to turn these novels into movies. This is not an exception too. It's a good movie. A great thriller. It's very intense and creepy. You probably get scared, but obviously you don't wanna cancel it cause it's interesting and you wanna know where the story ends. Oh, and of course, there is that twist in the end.. Frank Darabont has done some terrific piece of work before. And he does it again. A great adaptation to King's novel.This is your horror movie for the night. A gripping experience. And I'm sure you get the feeling here.",8,0,1,12 January 2011
8 Mile," lyrics have the power
","8 Mile is a movie based largely on an early life of Eminem in the suburb of Detroit. The movie does not show how Eminem became world-famous rapper. It shows that he was a talented white guy who loved rap which is primarily demesne of black guys. The film pictures very well how hard it is to make a breakthrough in music business. You have to be really gifted and likable and differ from others. Eminem shows exactly that. And there's no wonder what he has achieved for today. Eminem has a flair to do well. His rapping is exceptional. But he also proves he can act. He portraits basically himself though, so it's not that hard as landing on the moon. But nevertheless, he gives a good performance. He can talk, not only rap.Of course, what I most liked in this film, is music. Soundtrack is awesome. And I really enjoyed all the gigs in the movie. The lyrics were occasionally so money. As a big fan of Eminem and his music, I fully enjoyed it.",8,0,0,11 January 2011
The Dark Knight," to Heath
","I just followed this sequel to the Batman Begins. I must admit, I was left a bit disappointed. I'll tell why. The main reason probably is enormously high rating to The Dark Knight. I liked the first movie. It was very good. But my expectations were much more higher to the sequel. I still liked it much though. And I rate this high but definitely not into top 10. I even think Batman Begins was slightly better.Cast was extremely good. Christian Bale did his job and yet again I must say Michael Keaton remains the best Batman. Old foxes Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine seemed good again. But the best performance goes to Heath Ledger. A naturally gifted and talented young actor who's life was cut short unfortunately. All eyes were him. And he delivered. A worthy Oscar winner.If I'm honest, this film is a bit overrated but that's a logical reaction to Heaths leaving. I suggest you to see that. The last memorable performance by him.",9,2,3,17 January 2011
Into the Wild," you just live, man
","Into the Wild is a masterpiece by Sean Penn. The movie is very emotional. You have a very good chance to be moved by the life story of a young man who decides to fight against the system. The transcription written for him by his parents makes him feel like his life is already lived. It feels like everything so foregone conclusion. Like you don't have a chance to do things your own way and be surprised in life. A powerful drama.The cast overall is great. Emile Hirsch (Chris McCandless) is perfect for the role. It seems to me that Sean Penn is at least as good director as he is an actor. I have seen the book by Jon Krakauer and I must say the screenplay is a nice job. Even better is directing. The beautiful nature of Alaska, Colorado, Nevada etc is amazing. Sean Penn gives us incredible views and that's a big credit to the movie.Into the Wild is an inspiring movie. That's why I rate this high. Vince Vaughn (Wayne Westerberg) asks Emile Hirsch (Chris McCandless) what is he going to do in the wilderness of Alaska and the latter answers you just live it, man. And that sums up this film perfectly.",9,0,1,3 January 2011
Blood Diamond," leo at his best
","Blood Diamond is a very nice way how to spend your evening. It's just the movie you are looking for if bunch of friends are coming over. It's fast, it's full of adventures and action. There's even time for some love. Good entertainment.Leonardo DiCaprio steals the show completely. So adventurous, so skilled and confident. For me, his films are must-see. He is so consistent. It's an unique gift which only few have. Jennifer Connelly looks terrific. They match beyond expectations.It's a good film with a very shining lead actor. So it's a worth to see. Easy decision.",8,0,2,9 January 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," like a dream
","Suspense and sex are the keywords here. The movie is about one of the most interesting topics and it's sex. It shows how sex can affect a relationship between a nice and young couple and how big influence sex has on how we act to different situations. The one night story which the film follows is suspenseful and sexy so that makes it attractive. Nevertheless, there is not that much nudity or sex on-screen.In my opinion, all the Stanley Kubrick's films are must see. The Glare, long takes, close-ups of emotional faces, three-way conflicts etc are all something of an unique. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are a perfect couple here. They deliver quite well.The story told here is like a strange dream. Something completely different happens which tests your senses and you'd want to know why. But you certainly don't want to wake up because you'd want to know where it ends.",8,1,2,2 January 2011
The Godfather: Part III," the end of the saga
","I was a little skeptical before seeing Part:III. I mean the first two films are rated #2 and #3 in IMDb and the third film is not even close to being in the top250. Still it has same director, screenwriter and major part of the cast who were in the first two films too. After seeing this one, I have to admit. Part:III is underrated. It definitely should be at least in the top250. It isn't that intense than the first two parts. There are not such a shining performances but hey, it still is very good. Good story and quite similar to the first two films in my opinion.Al Pacino steals the show for me here as well. Although Andy Garcia is quite challenging. The supporting cast is quite good but it's the lead characters who shine the most. And they should be. They accomplish that and they should be recognized for that.This is the third and final part of the famous mafia saga. Don't leave it to watch this because of the low rating. You regret that. This is the end of the saga, the perfect end of the trilogy.",8,0,1,7 January 2011
The Departed," scorsese's winner
","The Departed offers you one of the best stories of mafia. Certainly the best combination of mob and police in the same movie. There are many good mafia films but this one sticks out because of its great usage of police. The value of this movie does not shrink to the fact that the film is mostly a remake to the Hongkong movie. The value is based how this one has been done. I gotta tell you, it's pretty damn high. And the reason behind that is Martin Scorsese. He absolutely nails this film. He, like Francis Ford Coppola, has a special eye for a mob films. And quite simply, this is his finest product. Leonardo DiCaprio (Billy) is one the best actors around. He is always so good. Never seen him underperformed. He gives a great shot here too. Jack Nicholson (Frank) is always reliable. Matt Damon (Colin) was good. But Mark Wahlberg (Dignam) was most impressive. Quite a performance from him. Very confident. In overall, it's just a first-class cast.The Departed is perfect film for a movie night. It's intense, has plenty of action, great story and great performances. Plus there are two huge bonuses. First one - the movie comes about Boston which is a great city. Second one - the movie has an awesome soundtrack which many films do not have. It has everything a winner should have.",10,4,6,9 January 2011
Crazy Heart," listen to the music
","Crazy Heart was a very pleasant surprise. I've had that film almost a year and I strangely wasn't very keen to see it. I knew the plot and the rating wasn't something overwhelming. I was so wrong. A really good drama that worked so well in todays world. Like you have some kind of road out of here and back to the cool times. Fascinating. Jeff Bridges (Bad Blake) is a worthy Oscar winner. One of the few people who actually look better with a goatee than shaved. I also liked that brilliant cameo by Colin Farrell (Tommy Sweet).The best part of the movie is definitely music. For the love of country music, you should see this one. The soundtracks truly caressed my ears. Believe me, they won't bite yours either.",9,1,1,26 January 2011
Inception," feed your mind
","Christopher Nolan is a genius. After seeing this movie, you have to admit it yourself. This guy does not only direct one the best films of last decade but the thought that he even came up with such a screenplay is gold itself. This is so money. The way the movie plays with your mind is something new. Something different that people have ween waiting for. And Nolan has absolutely delivered. The way he has used time differentials is second to none. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I mind was confused because it didn't know which clue to take. There were so many opened strands that you could have picked any of it and it would have amazed you.The cast is incredible. Leonardo DiCaprio is one the best around, he's never gonna disappoint you. Always brings in the best performance. The supporting cast in front of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and Ken Watanabe were great. A very pleasant surprise was Tom Hardy.Inception is a must see. It gives dreams a new angle. Most of people are fascinated, so am I. There's a good chance you could be too. Take that chance. Mind-blowing stuff!",10,0,4,3 January 2011
Lord of War," the businessman
","A really intense and exciting movie. I was thoroughly caught in the moment. Once I pushed the play button, I wanted it to play till the end. I think it's going to be almost with everyone. Because this one here is totally something different. Director Andrew Niccol is a newcomer and he has come with a bang. Terrific script and unique story. I mean, this is quality stuff. Highly recommended. Guys find it more interesting though. I can even say that you are not a guy if this one leaves you with nothing.A great cast is another big plus of LOW. Nicolas Cage has done many stupid films, but in this, he really is who we are used to see on the screen. A good-talking, confident and skillful guy. Very good supporting roles from the great Jared Leto and Ethan Hawke. Bridget Moynahan as Ava Fontaine gives us something extremely beautiful to see. So it's not only guns and bullets, there's a very good-looking woman too on the screen.Although it is not a true story, there is material in which this picture has got some key points. Leaving everything on one side, you get actually a great story how one simple guy became an extraordinary businessman. That's combination of confidence and intelligence. And it's awesome to see.",9,1,1,16 May 2011
Amélie," love at first sight
","There are so many reasons why this is the best French film ever. I mean, the story is like really good. It's a nice tale about love and being yourself. And there are funny side characters. The way the movie is filmed is quite different what we are used to see. That makes it unique. It contains several scenes of small details about characters and most of them makes you smile happily because they're either funny or they remind something about yourself. It's great.But for me, it is all about Audrey Tautou. Oh man, love at first sight. I mean, this is how a woman can be naturally cute and irresistible. She doesn't have to do anything special, just being herself and giving that unbelievable smile that makes even the unhappiest person on earth smile. She seems so real like she is not acting at all. I wish I could speak french. Totally lovable.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. And you may fall for her too..",9,1,4,2 January 2011
RED," action and that's it
","Retired Extremely Dangerous is a good action movie. It's that kinda film that you expect to see if you want to just chill and get entertained. There are some quite impressive action scenes. Also there are some quite comical scenes which make you probably smile. But that's about it. A lot eye-catching mistakes can be seen. There are many plot holes too. It's like if you are not entertained that much, all you want to ask is why- questions or 'how is that possible' questions.There are some superb actors around. Bruce Willis is good with his elegant and skilled character. He is definitely not retired. Others look solid but to see them do something totally different what we are used to see, like Helen Mirren shooting a machine gun on a party dress, is a little awkward.Nevertheless, if you are bored and you want to get entertained by a fast-paced action movie, you could give this one a go.",5,1,5,11 January 2011
Heat," in a sunny LA
","A lot of was expected. You don't get De Niro and Pacino in the same movie every year. They delivered too. Both played their characters extremely well. Especially Pacino (Vincent Hanna) who shines throughout the movie. Val Kilmer was a big surprise. Very composed yet creepy performance.It was the actors who drew my attention most. The other was the beautiful Los Angeles. The crime saga itself was left more background. Maybe because it was quite slow-paced. Or maybe I was just a bit impatient. Anyway, I wasn't happy with the ending which was left unfinished with me. A slight disappointment.Anyway, if you fancy a crime saga with minor errors but with quality actors, this is your man. A good 90's movie.",7,0,2,4 January 2011
300," king Leonidas
","300 is something you just can't ignore when you're a guy who loves great action films. The time of the act (450 BC) maybe be ancient but it sure gives you more than solid fighting scenes throughout the movie.There's one thing that makes this one very special. The fact that almost the whole movie was shot entirely using blue-screens and green-screens is quite remarkable. But for me personally, King Leonidas played by Gerard Butler stole the show. This is truly a great character played by a great actor. Leonidas is just the kind of leader anybody wants to have in their crew. He is fearless, confident and always totally in control of the situation. His well-known quotes are like installed in your brain after seeing the movie. This is absolutely great stuff and you do not wanna miss that, right?!",10,4,6,1 January 2011
Easy A," a stands for amazing
","It is a really nice movie for young people. It has many compulsory- elements which should be in this kind of movie. For example an huge high school party at some geek's home with colorful drinking cups, an entertainment show in the gym with school mascots, a scene in the headmaster's office, one really cool teacher etc. What I mean is that, you kinda know what you get, but it's awesome. I thought the humour wasn't lame. It was truly funny. I enjoyed the movie pretty much. Can't see any reason why you can't do the same.I gotta tell you, I love Emma Stone. I liked her personality and her sense of humour. It seemed like she didn't act. Like she is exactly like Olive in real life too. Easily amazing performance.",7,0,0,27 April 2011
The Social Network," world's youngest billionaire
","David Fincher is a great director with his own trademarks. I think the fact that he is the director of the film was the most anticipated thing in the movie for me. And I didn't disappoint. Fincher again showed a great skill to keep that intension till the end. He uses several time differentials which may confuse viewers who are either a little dumb or are not paying their attention. However, it's not quite clear how can you not focus cause the story is enthralling. What I mean is that, you, who you read this, you probably have a facebook account, right? And I believe you are a bit interested in how a regular 20-year old student with a bright brain managed to create the second most visited website in the world. Well, you could get you answer in this movie.Mark Zuckerberg is the world's youngest billionaire. When Bruno Mars sings that he wants to be a billionaire so bad, then Mark Zuckerberg actually has proved that even a young man can hit the absolute top. All you have to do is to come up with something which basically fascinates the whole world. If you visit facebook daily, you should see this movie.",8,1,2,11 January 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," attitude is the key
","I can honestly say that there are very few better movies in its genre. A pure inspiration. I absolutely loved it. The way this film affects you can't be underestimated. Everybody who believe in good things happen to good people get something for their soul. This is Will Smith's greatest acting by a clear mile. He delivers so well. His powerful emotions and character development are amazing. He nails the role of Chris Gardner, a story of a salesman with ongoing contraries in life to achieve success through determination and attitude. In addition, he has his own son Jaden playing his son in the movie, so it's a natural match.People need those kind of movies. They need something to keep them going. Many people are facing problems like Chris every single day. The movie not only gives inspiration, but it reminds us the most important factors to achieve success which are determination and attitude. The latter, in my opinion, is the key. Once you got it, impossible is nothing. The movie is in my elite list. I highly recommend it to everyone.",10,1,1,16 April 2011
The Fighter," great acting
","That's a powerhouse. I haven't seen such a good boxing movie long time. Really got me into. The whole film is based on a true story. And it's quite inspiring. There is not that much boxing. The centre is more to the relationships between the leading character and his family. And I enjoyed that pretty much. What I really liked were soundtracks. The music during some fast-paced scenes were top notch.Mark Wahlberg wow! Christian Bale wow! Amy Adams wow! Melissa Leo wow! I mean, cast is the strongest part of the movie. They all absolutely deliver. Special praise goes to Christian Bale.Boxing movies are certainly not for everyone. But the fans find this one thrilling hundred percent. I'm definitely a fan.",8,0,0,28 January 2011
The Godfather," a family man
","The greatest film ever said by many. First film of the greatest trilogy ever said by many. I agree with second one, but not the first one. This is the greatest trilogy. And the first film is the pearl of that package. I drew my expectations extremely high before watching this classic. Unfortunately I had to fall. I didn't get the grain, that cutting-edge I was looking for. Fortunately the fall wasn't that high. I still liked the movie a lot. It was a great picture. A massive film in its genre. I like good mafia films. But I don't fancy them that much. But like I said, in its own genre this picture is a front runner.The cast is the strongest part of the movie. Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) as The Godfather is like a fist to the eyehole. He is just so boss. At the same time he is so wise and calm. Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and others give a very good contribution, but it is Marlon Brando who shines throughout the movie. The line 'the man who does not spend time with his family, is not a man' is epic.There are lots of classic music in this movie. Some parts of the movie are in Italian. This is not your regular Hollywood movie. This is not that entertaining but still after seeing this, you'll probably say 'wow'.",8,1,2,3 January 2011
