Requiem for a Dream," absolutely shocking, it make me feel want to stop drug.
","centered about the degeneration of beauty into a scenario previsible but how cruel.Jennifer Connery was cute at first then she incarned her character better and better as the movie went on. I believe she was virgin at the start because of the ring they showed once and the way she acted with her boyfriend. They never showed acts of sex but what love before marriage should be. She lost something special due to drug addiction, something which will never be replaced.Ellen Burstyn was a beautiful old woman which i hated seeing fall into madness. I liked her smiles and found cute her craziness for the ad as well as her obsession for the food at first, but when i knew why, everything changed, i feel nothing but pity.All the actors and actress were excellent making me believe the stereotype story. It almost made me cry seeing how things evolved. Its a strong warning for whoever abuse drug in a senseless way, which you clearly cant control the use.I smiled the first half and felt sad the second, the ending is pathetic to the point of being the worst part of this amazing movie, but the damage was done. I was too immersed in the story and it kinda brought me back to reality.A nice find for whoever want to see the devastating effects of hard drugs on what should have been the perfect life, a movie i wont forget.",10,0,1,7 January 2013
