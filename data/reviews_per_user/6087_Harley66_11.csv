Ghost," Whoopi, Swayze and Moore at their best
","Ghost is a great supernatural thriller with a humorous edge. Sam Wheat and Molly Jensen (Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore) have decided to live together. He is an investment banker and she is a sculptress. Paul (Tony Goldwyn) works with Sam. Sam and Molly are truly in love, the only problem is Sam cannot say the three little words that Molly wants to hear. When she tells him she loves him, all he can say is 'Ditto'. Sam and Molly are refurbishing their dream house. They are enjoying their life together. After attending an Off-Broadway production of Macbeth, Molly decides it time to get married. They are mugged and Sam is shot and killed. His spirit starts to ascend but he cannot leave Molly, so he is stranded on Earth. Ghost Sam follows Molly around. But he has problems passing through doors. Sam gets trapped in the townhouse. When the door opens it is not Molly but the man who killed him. He realizes that his death was not random. Sam follows the killer home and discovers that Molly has something he wants. On his way back he notices a storefront Sister Oda Mae Brown Spiritual Adviser Contact The Dearly Departed. He is curious and enters. Oda Mae (Whoopi Goldberg) is a charlatan psychic but during her séance, she can hear everything Sam says. Sam realizes she has the gift and decides use her to warn Molly. Of course, Molly has a hard time believing Oda Mae. Even when she does believe, she still has doubts. Eventually, Sam finds out the whole truth. But the man behind the killing is getting desperate and he needs to get rid of the last witness, Molly. Jerry Zucker was most famous for Airplane and other spoofs he created with his brother. No one expected this level of sophistication in his direction. It starts out as a romance, then becomes a supernatural movie with comedic elements and ends up a mystery, which it was the whole time. Each handled with precision. Patrick Swayze had a series of hits but all the films would be considered light weight. This was his first acting triumph. Demi Moore was known for good performances in B Films. This was her first great performance in an A Film. Whoopi Goldberg took show business by storm. Mike Nichols discovered her on woman show and brought it to Broadway. This started her meteoric rise. Next Spielberg cast her in the lead of The Color Purple and Whoopi received a Best Actress Oscar Nomination. Since then, she was a star but never found another defining role. That is until Ghost. She takes Oda Mae Brown to a level even the writer and director did not expect. Her ability to go from high drama to slapstick without it looking unreal was perfection. I knew when I saw the film that this was her Oscar performance, and it was. Ghost has something for everyone in it. DVD EXTRAS: Documentary - Remembering the Magic - A look back on creation of this film. It is very interesting with great insights about the film and the makers.",6,4,7,8 September 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A tale of love, war and power
","Oh and what a movie this is. There is something for everyone in the family with this movie, romance, action, drama, horror, adventure and fantasy. A quality of acting rivaling no other movie in recent times, except for the Rings trilogy, but that's another thing altogether. I have watched this movies so many times that I can't even keep track. This movie never gets boring. Johnny Depp is at the top of this career with this film!! A must see, many times over. A true classic! The cursed tale of a pirate ship's captain, marooned by his mutineering mates and left for dead on a desert isle. He returns with another ship, this time stolen from the Royal Navy, in order to reclaim his rightful command of the infamous Black Pearl, a ship so evil that hell itself spat back her dead. He is joined by the son of a murdered pirate ship's mate, a swordsman who's skill and craft are equal to that of Robin Hood himself. The boy is motivated by love for a woman, herself of royal blood and captured by those mutineering pirates of ill repute in order to release a curse cast upon them from the captured gold of the famous Spanish explorer and conquistador, Hernando Cortez. With the Royal Navy in hot pursuit of their stolen ship, the captain and the boy, along with another crew of pirates, make haste for the Black Pearl, execute a cunning plan, and live happily ever after. Well, not exactly like that but almost. This film is destined a classic because of the dry, witty comments, superb acting of the entire cast, outstanding writing and special effects, and it's about time someone put this swashbuckling story to film. Rated PG-13, which is the number of times you should see this movie.",9,5,9,25 August 2008
Hostel," HOSTEL: a diamond in the (very) rough
","I must admit, what truly attracted me to Eli Roth's second film, Hostel, was the rarely-granted Quentin Tarantino presentation. As any die-hard Tarantino fan will say, whatever The Man presents, the viewer must watch. His stamp of approval means more - much, much more - than any Ebert review. I am also a hardcore genre fan: my ears become flushed with anticipation at the sound of anything even remotely associated with the exhilarating genre that is horror. It is therefore understandable that I was quite excited about finally watching Hostel in all of its bloody, violent, bits-of-brain-and-skull-splattered-on-the-wall glory. After all, I had mostly heard that it was a step forward in the world of horror films, continuing a tradition of unprecedented on-screen violence set off by Japanese filmmakers long before American directors dared to risk receiving that naughty (and now highly coveted) NC17 rating. So, without further ado, here are my post-viewing good and (unfortunately) bad news. For the good news: the setting of the film (mostly parts of Slovakia) is quite original, particularly for audiences of previous American horror. It does not have that generic and infuriating Hollywood feel either - it looks, sounds, and feels like a real place. Now, if this isn't the most crucial aspect of a successful horror film (think Audition, think original Texas Chainsaw Massacre), I don't know what is. Roth scores more points in his cast selection. Jay Hernandez truly takes the Most Realistically Scared award in this film - he was so friggin' terrified when he got to the Elite Hunting headquarters that I wanted to forgive his immmature and sexist behavior during the first 40 minutes of Hostel. Roth then scores some more points with his courageous and excessively gory scenes (which I will not give away for those who haven't watched the movie yet). They were certainly enough to satisfy even the darkest cravings of decades-old horror fans. Finally, Roth scores bonus points by playing a dubbed version of Pulp Fiction at the actual hostel in the movie, and the Miike Takashi cameo was as gratifying as any cameo can ever be. Now, for the bad news: for the first 45 minutes of the film, I felt as though I had mistakenly stumbled upon an unusually long porno with a poorly constructed storyline. The naked chicks by the dozen, the unnecessary sex, the talking about sex, the incessant search for sex, and the overall ignorant sexism of the 3 main characters were unbearably annoying - and, did I mention, unnecessary? I wanted to somehow remind Roth that I am addicted to horror, not sex, and that wasting 40 minutes of perfectly good screen time on boobs and asses instead of chainsaws and kitchen knives just won't cut it. I think any true horror fan will agree with me on this - unless, of course, Roth was trying to make a connection between excessive sex and excessive violence, which become sort of tangled in Hostel. At any rate, I would've been much happier if Roth had spent those first 40 minutes setting a more frightening mood and teasing me about the cinematic gorefest that was to come. I will say this, however: once the gore begins, there is no turning back - and the villains are remarkably and terrifyingly realistic. Hostel is, perhaps, a diamond in the very rough - with some refreshingly strong peaks and quite a few flaws that need to be polished. I still admire Roth for his daring nature and his obvious passion for horror - these two things, at least, came through loud and clear in the puzzling and controversial film that is Hostel.",6,0,1,28 September 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A step up from Phantom Menace
","I'm not a HUGE fan of episodes 1 through 3. However, I AM a huge star wars fan so I took that into account when viewing this movie. The fact is it's a better movie than part 1, plain and simple. You get to see Anakin becoming a jedi and taking his first steps toward losing himself. You learn about an impatient side to him that will ultimately be his undoing. The movie itself focuses on Anakin's many relationships. That with his mother, with Padme, the Jedi Council, Obi-Wan and, of course, the man that would be Emperor Palpatine. For the importance of forwarding the plot, this movie was vitally important to the series. As a movie in general, I was not entirely impressed. I felt like Anakin was portrayed as way too immature for the man that would ultimately become Darth Vader. In episodes 4, 5 and 6, Darth Vader is ultimate Evil. Are we supposed to buy that ultimate evil was borne out of a whiney teenager? On second thought, maybe that IS the source of the ultimate evil in the universe.",8,1,2,12 September 2008
"Monsters, Inc."," It's Only Hearsay!
","While I cannot, in all honesty, say that I have actually viewed it from beginning to end, I can attest to the fact that I have enjoyed hearing the entire movie at least 100 times. Let me explain. We have put on many highway miles traveling with our grandchildren in our DVD equipped van. Driver: yours truly, DVD watchers: grandchildren, Movie playing: Monsters, Inc. over and over and over again! So, even though I have only seen and enjoyed the actual movie footage a little here, a little there, I feel confident rating Monsters, Inc. a 5* movie. Then again, from what I've heard that's only hearsay on my part. ~ The Boss (Mrs. B. agrees!)",9,0,1,15 September 2008
Cast Away," Guaranteed to shed a tear
","A very good movie, Cast Away, brings to the screen the story of a Fed-Ex employee who is stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific Ocean following a plane crash. Once there, it is his thoughts of his loved one and of home that provide him with the necessary strength to endure unprecedented difficulties. Cast Away is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength. Tom Hanks is superb in his role as Chuck Noland, and although the rest of the cast do not have that many lines in the movie, nevertheless, they have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least. All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good! In short, Cast Away is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!",8,2,3,6 September 2008
Batman Begins," Christian Bale takes the crown as the best Batman ever....
","I was unfortunate enough in not seeing this film in theaters and I regret it everyday. I own the single wide screen version of the film on DVD, but if you have a 1080p TV go for the blu-ray version. I honestly believed that Christian Bale was the wrong actor for the role and boy was i dead wrong. I must say he is the best Batman hands down. Now that would be a big statement coming from a huge fan of the comics. I base my decision on Bale's incredible skills of performing real moves of martial arts. for the first time i finally see batman actually use his elbows as well as his knees to take down some of his foes. It's funny to see in the 1989 Version how Michael Keaton could just do a back hand punch on somebody and knock him out instantly. I also find him to be a bad shooter as he literally aims at the joker with his arsenal on the bat wing and still misses. I believe Christian Bale is the real deal and now that the 'Dark Knight' is out, it's official that no one else is capable of beating him as Batman. This movie makes you forget that there was ever a Batman film before it. I recommend this film for hardcore Batman fans and those who are just introduced to the franchise. I suggest getting the DVD since it's cheaper but if you're spoiled with a HDTV then get the blu ray.",9,1,1,28 September 2008
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Charlie and the chocolate factory
","In the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory five ordinary kids get the once and a lifetime opportunity to visit Willie Wonka's(Johnny Depp) candy factory. These five kids are Charlie Bucket, Violet Bourigard, Mike T.V., Veruca Salt and Agustace Gloop. These children are all brats and greedy all that they want is the special prize at the end all but one. This crazy insane tour lead by Mr. Willie Wonka is laugh out loud funny. The best parts though are when the oompa loompas sing the funniest songs in the world! Fallow this tour as things go unplanned. I loved this movie since I first saw it in the theaters and I know the whole movie by heart but it never gets old. I think that it is the best movie in the world. This is a movie that the whole family will enjoy. There is something that everyone in the whole family will love. From the songs to the jokes you will find your self laughing so hard that tears will roll down your cheeks and your stomach is about to explode.",8,1,3,19 September 2008
The Da Vinci Code," Good but not Great
","I think the problem the makers had was trying to get the very convoluted story across with reams of dialogue. The nature of the story demands this but it takes a while and doesn't have the 'page-turner' effect of the book as these revelations, which happen often, are not visually appealing but portray images when you read them. I think they did as well as could be expected getting a complicated story to the screen intact. Silas the monk is menacing, Jean Reno as Bezu Fache could have been made more of but as is the nature of the story, it doesn't lend itself well to character development, the main focus of the film is on the revelations, which are just spoken words. Ian McKellen is excellent as Sir Leigh Teabing, the eccentric English symbologist who turns a bit nasty and Audrey Tatou as Sophie Neveu is exactly how you would have imagined her to look whilst reading the book. Tom Hanks's voice was uncannily similar to that of the voice the reader used when Robert Langdon was speaking. Also, I didn't feel(as some others have said before me) that the dialouge was wooden, nor did I feel that you had to read the book to like this movie. I also thought that you can be Christian and like this film, because it has good suspense,and a very good plot, and if you don't like the theories, you don't HAVE to believe them.",8,1,2,10 September 2008
The Lion King," The Greatest Animated Film
","When I first watched The Lion King, I had mixed feelings about it. I've never been a fan of Elton John, and his songs are less than impressive. The animation is stunning, and I thought the voice actors were all cast perfectly - especially Matthew Broderick as adult Simba, as well as Jeremy Irons as Scar. I know the quintessential tearjerking part is when Mufasa dies, but the part that always gets to me is at the end when Simba finally ascends Pride Rock and looks up into the clouds and hears his father say 'Remember...' It gets to me every time! All in all,I was very impressed with the DVD version.I especially love the voice talents of Matthew Broderick,Jonathan Taylor Thomas,Jeremy Irons,Whoopi Goldberg,Rowan Atkinson,and many others. Great job!",9,0,0,26 August 2008
Aladdin," A Fun Children's Story
","The story of Aladdin, from a collection of stories dating back more than a millennium, has been filmed dozens of times in dozens of variations. However, none was ever filmed as creatively, humorously and family friendly as Disney Studios did in 1992. The success of the movie owes much to the talents of Robin Williams, whose manic impersonations and characterizations propel this movie along at a frantic pace. Disney also kept the story of Aladdin and Princess Jasmine simple, helping the appeal of the movie. This story is relatively simple, cutting out much of the detail from the original story. Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weinger), is a teenager trying to find enough to eat in Baghdad. Though Aladdin steals food and is a bit of a rogue, he also has a sense of fairness, honor and innocence, a 'diamond in the rough' that evil Grand Vizier Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman) needs to enter the Cave of Wonders to steal the magic lamp. Aladdin enters the cave and finds the lamp, but uses the lamp to escape and become Prince Ali in an attempt to win the heart and hand of Princess Jasmine (voiced by Linda Larkin). As we learn early in the movie, Princess Jasmine wants nothing to do with phonies and princes; she is looking for someone to whom she can give her heart, someone who will understand and love her. Prince Ali is not that person. Jafar wants the power of being the Sultan of Baghdad. His plan is simple, get the lamp, gain absolute power, marry Jasmine, and take over the world; not necessarily in that order. I would be remiss if I failed to mention Jafar's trusty adviser Iago the Parrot, voiced by the always obnoxious and, certainly in the case of this movie, funny Gilbert Gottfried. Perhaps if Jafar had not had a parrot as an adviser, things might have turned out different for him. The animation in this edition of the movie is marvelous. The colors are bright and images are quite clear. This movie is excellent to watch on your big screen television. Another wonderful feature of this movie is the music. The standout song is 'A Whole New World,' but I also liked 'Prince Ali' and 'One Jump Ahead.' Alan Menken's score and Tim Rice's music garnered an Oscar for Menken and an Oscar for Menken and Rice. In fact, this movie won 22 significant awards and was nominated for another 15. Aladdin is a good guy trying to survive in a tough world. Princess Jasmine is naïve and innocent. Aladdin's love for Jasmine is pure and teenage and children and teenagers everywhere will identify with Aladdin's angst. The song and dance routines of the Robin Williams' Genie keep the overall tone of this movie light, which is necessary to help balance the evil of Grand Vizier Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman). I recommend this movie for all members of the family except for the very youngest members, who may be frightened by the images of Jafar and the Genie is a couple of the scenes. Most children ages 4 and above should be able to watch this movie with little difficulty. Enjoy!",6,0,1,19 September 2008
