The New World," awful to watch, beautiful to look at
","First, I'll concede that this movie has a beautiful, authentic look. And that's all that it has going for it.I found the story almost impossible to follow. First it abruptly jumped in the time line of the story. Second, there is little dialog to explain what is happening. Third, maybe it's my hearing, but I couldn't understand much of what was being said. The actors seemed to be mumbling all the time. Fourth, can anyone do a movie about the colonization of America without the modern stereotypes of 'Indians as spiritual and majestic, whites as crazed barbarians' ? The movie was so interminable that I finally just turned it off. First time I've posted a review on IMDb.com for a movie I didn't watch in its entirety but I felt I had to say something.",1,0,5,4 December 2006
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," incoherent
","The movie is handsomely filmed and has all sorts of clever special effects but the story line was totally incoherent to me. RDJ's Holmes looks like he has not only shaved in days but he hasn't bathed in days, either. Jude Law's Dr. Watson looks equally scruffy. Didn't anyone shave in the 1890s? There's a lot of bantering between Holmes and Watson which is entertaining but very little of the deductive reasoning that was the core of every Holmes story. And yes, in the books Holmes did know some sort of Asian martial arts but these new movies make him into a martial arts expert an a par with Bruce Lee. It's so incongruous to the rest of the story and the setting as to be very distracting.",3,10,18,19 December 2011
United 93," Best film of 2006
","'United 93' is, as of mid-year, the best film of 2006. Powerful, wrenching, it puts the viewer right into the airplane and makes you feel that you're one of the passengers on the flight.Great casting and, if you've read the book 'Among The Heroes' you will note that most of the actors look very much like the people they're portraying even though none of the people on the plane are identified by name except the captain and co-pilot.Terrific pacing for the movie and, at least from the moment the plane is hijacked and until the crash, the movie is shot in real-time. The passengers had precious little time to determine what was going on and to devise a counterattack. You know of course that they're going to fail and the passengers certainly knew that the likelihood that they could take over the plane and fly it themselves was almost non-existent. But they were determined that if they were to die they weren't going to allow the plane to hurt anyone else. They died fighting and representing the greatest values of our country---self-sacrifice, teamwork, faith in God and iron courage.",10,1,4,20 June 2006
Monty Python's Life of Brian," stick to the TV shows
","I have always been a great fan of Monty Python which is without a doubt the greatest TV comedy troupe of all time. But I have never thought that their style of humor was ever enough to carry a feature-length movie and watching the re-release of 'Life of Brian' only confirms that for me. Monty Python's Flying Circus worked best in the short, often hysterically funny, skit form. The TV episodes would often have a very general theme but usually careened from one topic to another without necessarily any connection. But on the big screen they have to do an entire story either about King Arthur or about Brian of Nazareth and I don't think that they ever really sustain the humor in either show. Certainly there are some inspired parts---the Roman centurions desperately trying not to laugh at a lisping Pontius Pilate. Only they then overkill that joke by having Pilate then speak to a crowd of Jews later in the movie. It was funny the first time, not funny the second time. The bits dealing with the all-talk, no-action People's Front of Judea were good as well. But the rest of the movie doesn't really work for me, or I should say they certainly don't measure up to the best parts of the TV series. I was finally able to spot George Harrison's cameo in the movie. George considered the Pythons to be the spiritual heirs of the Beatles and Python Eric Idle later helped make a very funny mockumentary of the Beatles called 'The Rutles' which George also participated in. What would been terrific to see would've been some sort of joint effort between Monty Python and the Beatles (as it was, Ringo was the only Beatle to have a brief appearance on a Python episode). 'Life of Brian' gets credit for being the first and only movie to satirize Christianity and I think Christians who are offended take it way too seriously. But if you want to watch truly great film satires, watch the Marx Brothers' terrific 'Duck Soup' and Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove'. Both are extremely funny and relevant.",Null,5,15,2 October 2004
The Hunger Games," derivative and boring
","I've never read the books but went to an afternoon screening to see what the fuss was about. 'The Hunger Games' I felt was a complete bore. The story unwinds in an excruciatingly slow manner and you really have no emotional connection with the characters. The plot-line itself---people of a dystopian future being made to fight to the death on TV has been done to death (no pun) and done with more wit an imagination in 'The Running Man' for instance. The gladiator story is told much better in real gladiator movies like 'Gladiator' and 'Spartacus' which are both hugely better than 'The Hunger Games'.For an action movie it feels like days go by before there is any real action. The 'name' actors like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland seem to be as bored as the viewer is with this material. The unknown actors playing the competitors are wooden. When there is action it is usually with such herky-jerky camera work that you can barely follow what is happening. And there are some gaping plot holes. SPOILER ALERT the heroine is treed by the others who will just wait her out to get hungry and come down. And of course they snooze instead. The 'simulated' monster animals that can actually devour people? Most of the competitors are killed off camera? Come on. . .",1,130,190,1 April 2012
The Hustler," Best Sports Movie Ever
","I think 'The Hustler' is the best sports movie ever made. Fast Eddie Felson is perhaps the most talented pool shooter in the country and yet, at his core, he's a born loser. Why is Eddie so self-destructive? He has Minnesota Fats, ostensibly the country's greatest player, beaten in the first marathon match only to drink himself into insensibility and let Fats off the hook. Throughout the movie Eddie is surrounded by other people who are self-destructive or only interested in making a buck off of him. Even Charlie, his original manager (Myron McCormick in a terrific role)needs him for a meal ticket. Bert, his second manager, is a slithering, calculating parasite who uses everyone around him. Sara, Eddie's pathetic girlfriend, is going through life in an aimless, alcoholic haze. The movie really lets you into the lives of these people who live on the margins of society. The cinematography is outstanding, the settings and mood of the movie draw you in totally. The acting is uniformly outstanding from top to bottom. Great movies get great performances from the minor characters, too. Vincent Gardenia, Michael Constantine, Murray Hamilton and McCormick are perfect in the smaller roles while Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie (all getting well-deserved Oscar nominations) and George C. Scott are indelible in the major roles. Even boxer Jake LaMotta has a cameo as a bartender. Can Eddie finally overcome being a born loser? Can love redeem any of these lost people? What makes a person a champion? Is it talent alone or does a champion need some inner demon that can only be defeated by pursuing victory at all costs?",Null,43,63,2 October 2004
Don Jon," self-absorbed drivel
","If you want to go to a movie where you are assaulted with 90 minutes of almost non-stop vulgarity, the characters (with the exception apparently of the Catholic priest who's never on camera) saying 'f'ck' seemingly every alternate word, if you want to see a movie about a man unrepentantly absorbed with pornography and the relentless objectification of women, then you might want to see 'Don Jon.' The movie is no doubt a hit on the coasts but in fly-over country where I live (albeit, 250 mi from the coast) there was a grand total of four people who attended the viewing I went to. I was going to walk out after the first 30 minutes but managed to doze off for a bit.The movie is probably going to be compared to 'Auto Focus', the bio-pic about Bob Crane and his sex addiction and murder. 'Auto Focus' is far superior and it shows how a man's life falls apart due to his obsession. 'Don Jon' takes the attitude that sex addiction is just no big deal. By the end of the movie Jon seems to have found a woman he can connect with but you also know he has absolutely no inclination whatsoever to quit his porn obsession.",1,54,112,29 September 2013
Zodiac," excellent
","I'd read Graysmith's book a couple of times and therefore knew quite a bit about the investigation. ZODIAC didn't take any liberties with the story, as far I could tell. In fact, it went to great lengths to be realistic, to the point where the murders depicted in the movie were all filmed at the locations of the real murders---the murder at the lake was even filmed on the exact same day of the year. I believe the two surviving victims were consultants for the movie.Robert Downey, Jr. steals the movie and his take as reporter Paul Avery descending into alcoholism and drug use might have been too close to reality for Downey. It is way too early but Downey should be remembered when it comes time to bounce around actors worthy of Oscar consideration next year, he's that good in this movie.",9,2,7,4 March 2007
Gettysburg," as long to watch as it took to fight
","This is a terribly long movie and you feel every minute of it.  Not that being long is bad---some stories need that extra hour and when it is done like 'Titanic' the time just flys by.  But the pacing in 'Gettysburg' is excrutiatingly slow, even most of the fighting is done at a walk or a trot.The movie does have an authentic look to it and great care was made in having the actors look like twins of their real-life characters.  The upside of using the Civil War reenactors is that the costuming of the extras is very good.  But I agree with other comments---where did all these whizzened, elderly privates and corporals come from?  You see far too many overweight extras---I can guarantee you that there certainly couldn't have been that many overweight Rebel soldiers, not given all the marching they did and the scanty food they had!  While it was good that the movie used the real Gettysburg battlefield, one jarring ananchronism is that as the camera pans over the Southern army prior to Pickett's charge, you can see a truck or a car driving down a road behind them. The battle scenes, particularly Little Round Top, were done well in this movie but that is the only reason to see it.  The acting in this movie is pretty bad with the exception of maybe three or four people.  Jeff Daniels was in the running for an Oscar nomination as Joshua Chamberlain and Tom Berenger and Richard Jordan do well as Longstreet and Armistad.  But I thought the rest of the actors were just too over the top.  Martin Sheen's take on Lee was so reverent that you'd thought that he was playing Moses. The characters go on and on in these overwrought speeches and entire scenes are devoted to things like Southern generals debating the theory of evolution! I've tried to like this movie but it simply puts me to sleep every time I see it.  I've resorted to fast-forwarding to the battle scenes and leaving out the rest.  Despite this being a Union victory, most of the story is told from the Southern perspective and one cannot help but feel a Southern bias in the movie.  It was produced by Ted Turner who has a cameo as an officer killed in Pickett's Charge.",Null,0,0,2 August 2002
Malcolm X," excellent
","Denzel Washington gives a tour De force performance as Malcolm X and the best parts of the movie are when he is preaching to the masses. The worst part of the movie though is Spike Lee's character, a fictional guy named 'Shorty.' Lee's role seems to be mainly for comic relief but this movie didn't need it. Lee has rightfully complained about stereotype depictions of blacks in cinema and then turns around and plays the only stereotype black character in his definitive movie about one of America's greatest black leaders?For a movie that addresses racism, there isn't a single white character in this movie who has any redeeming features. Could you make a movie nowadays in which every single minority character is a terrible person?",8,2,7,4 August 2002
Glory," outstanding
","This is one of the best war movies ever made and an important one.  The movie had a terrific, authentic look and was helped by the fact that a lot of the extras in the movie were Civil War reenactors who are noted for their dedication to authenticity.  The cast is outstanding.  Matthew Broderick was just right as Col. Robert Gould Shaw and he picks up Shaw's rich boy/idealist attitude perfectly. Shaw may have owed his command to his family's connections but he was no poser---he died leading his men from the front.  The Confederates thought they were descecrating him by burying him in a mass grave with his black troops---Shaw's parents later said that their son couldn't have had a prouder burial.Of course the core of the movie are the black soldiers.  This was possibly the first big movie about the black soldier in the Civil War and you can tell that these men are putting everything they've got into their parts. Denzel Washington easily deserved his Oscar for this movie and no one can forget the scene where he's flogged and defiantly takes his punishment without crying out---except for a tear rolling down his face. 
Andre Braugher I thought had the most interesting part though---the educated freeman who immediately volunteers to fight only to find out that he's the most physically inept man in the company.  Braugher's character is caught in a terrific cultural battle---he looks down on the other blacks who are mostly runaway slaves and identifies himself more with the white officers. But as an enlisted he's not allowed to even talk to the officers. Washington torments him unceasingly and mocks him for trying to act like he's white.  Braugher's best scene is the prayer/song meeting the night before the battle of Ft. Wagner.  The men are singing spirituals and praising God and you can see Braugher's character transform---he finally sees the nobility of these men that he's looked down upon and he realizes that these are truly his people and his brothers, and he becomes a 'black' man for the first time in his life and knows that he has dignity because of that.The most memorable thing about this movie for me is the effect this movie had on my two boys.  I let them watch this movie when they were barely kindergarten age and they were fascinated by it.  It was the first Civil War movie they'd ever seen and they peppered me with questions during the movie. I had to assure them that white people fought to free the slaves, too, not just black soldiers!  But I wanted my boys, who are white, to see that America had and has black heroes as well--when I was their age such a movie was unthinkable.  After the movie was over my boys ran to their room to play soldier and re-enact parts of the movie.  I could hear them arguing--both of them wanted to be the black soldier (the good guy!).  Finally my youngest let his brother be the black soldier and then he said, 'I'll pretend I'm white!'  I got a little choked up when I heard him say that---that two children might be able to be so colorblind was exactly the type of world that the heroes of the 54th were fighting to create.  I think they would've been proud of a 4 yr old boy saying that.",Null,0,0,24 July 2002
In the Name of the Father," outstanding cinema
","This is a terrific movie and the acting is just outstanding.  Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the finest actors in the world and he never makes a misstep in a role.  He had just come off of making 'The Last of Mohicans' and when 'In the Name of the Father' was cast he suggested Pete Postlethwaite for the rold of Guiseppe Conlan.  Postlethwaite had a very small role in 'Mohicans' but he he got an Oscar nomination for 'Father' and his career took off.  No doubt he sends Day-Lewis a Christmas gift every year (if he doesn't, he should!).The movie has two parallel stories---the Conlans' fight to clear their names and the contentious relationship between the father and son.  I thought that the most powerful scene in the movie was when Guiseppe and Gerry are put into a cell together for the first time.  Gerry, who's already been severely tortured, is scared out of his wits and begins railing against his father, letting all of his resentments towards his father boil out.  Guiseppe stoically takes the verbal abuse until Gerry breaks down and falls into his father's arms.  In the end he is a frightened child, clinging to his father for protection.  Just a tremendous acting job by both men. 
An interesting trivia aside, Gerry's buddy in the movie, Paul Hill, later married one of Bobby Kennedy's daughters.  When he was tortured to confess he not only confessed to the Guilford bombing but to killing a Belfast police officer.  Of course he was exonerated of the bombing but amazingly the British gov't fought to make the police officer murder charge stick, claiming apparently that even though Hill was tortured to confess falsely to the bombing, that his tortured confession to the other murder was acceptable to convict him.  The higher court finally threw out the conviction and Hill was finally free. 'In the Name of the Father' is a movie that will make you angry.  And it will also move you as a tremendous portrayal of a relationship between father and son.",Null,3,9,26 July 2002
Quantum of Solace," very disappointing
","I really like Daniel Craig as James Bond; I think he has the look, the ruthlessness and the charisma for the role. But 'Quantum of Solace' is a total mess. If you haven't seen 'Casino Royale' you'll have a hard time following 'Quantum' and even if you have seen it, you'll have a hard time following 'Quantum'. The story I thought was totally incoherent. Mostly it seemed to just be an exercise in putting together some chase and fight scenes. And they did nearly all of them---a car chase, a foot chase, a boat chase, an airplane chase (just about everything except chases on bicycles and spacecraft). Fight scenes? Gunfights, fist fights, martial arts, knife fights. . .I know the filmmakers are trying to go on an entirely new take with Bond but 'Quantum' is indistinguishable from the Bourne series. Bourne is fine and I like them, but I expect something different from Bond and I didn't get it in this movie.Also, did I miss this or am I mistaken? At one point Bond is helped by 'Ms. Fields' a British Embassy staffer in Bolivia. She is asked several times by Bond what her first name is and she refuses to tell him. She eventually is bedded by Bond and then killed in a way that is a total rip-off of the killing of Jill Masters in 'Goldfinger.' That's okay, I suppose, but why the coyness about her first name which is never stated in the movie (if it was, I didn't hear it). The mystery was unraveled in the credits when her name is given as 'Strawberry Fields'. A rather lame joke I suppose using a Beatles song but it would've been okay HAD HER NAME ACTUALLY BEEN SAID IN THE MOVIE!!! There's no question Bond would've had at least one quip about her name being a Beatles title but as far as I could tell, there were none. So why call her 'Strawberry Fields' in the credits? Why not 'Mildred Fields' or 'Harriet Fields'? It's just an example of how this movie falls short.",4,1,2,29 November 2008
The Dirty Dozen," great movie
","'The Dirty Dozen' must be one of Ted Turner's favorite movies since the picture seems to run endlessly on WTBS or TNT. It is a fun movie to watch, all the way through.  Everyone knows the premise so there's no reason to repeat it here.Great movies need two things---a great story and great acting.  Plausible or not, 'Dozen''s story is highly entertaining and it has many riveting moments, right from the start with the hanging of one of the prisoners (too bad for him that Lee Marvin shows up too late to include him for the mission!).  Marvin is the center of the movie and he carries a lot of credibility, being a wounded WWII veteran himself.  'Dozen' is an important movie if only because it was the screen debuts for both Jim Brown and Donald Sutherland.  If there was another WWII movie before this one which depicted a black soldier as a hero, I haven't seen it and it is interesting to note that, of the prisoners, Brown's character is the only one who truly doesn't deserve the punishment that he's awaiting, having killed in self-defense. Donald Sutherland doesn't have a lot to do in this movie but his gaunt, moronic Pinckney gives the movie some comic relief, particularly where he gets to impersonate a general inspecting crack paratroopers.Most of the 'Dozen' don't get a lot to do in this movie---just too many characters and not enough time to develop them (sort of like how the Wally Schirra character was given almost no lines in 'The Right Stuff').  An ensemble piece like this usually means that there's a lot of competition going on amongst the cast and John Cassavettes and Telly Savalas stand out as Franco, the urban hoodlum, and Maggett, the psychotic rapist.  Savalas has the harder part, playing a truly rotten and despicable character who has absolutely no redeeming qualities.  You're not unhappy when Maggett is killed later on but you have to admire how Savalas deftly handles the part---I say deftly because this type of role could've typecast him forever if he hadn't played it just right.",Null,0,1,2 August 2002
The Pianist," Outstanding
","'The Pianist' is perhaps the best movie ever made about the Holocaust. Roman Polanski's interpretation of the story is deeper and truer than Steven Spielberg's in 'Schindler's List' because Polanski was himself a survivor of the Holocaust.  Spielberg only read about in history books like everyone else who wasn't there. The movie has a very authentic look and, unlike 'Schindler's List' which masses all of the victims together and focuses the story on the Christian who is saving them, 'The Pianist' focuses on the plight of one man and his family.Adrien Brody's work in this movie is magnificent, well deserving of his Oscar, as Polanski was deserving of his.  The movie deserved the Best Picture Oscar which it lost out on to 'Chicago'.",Null,0,1,2 May 2004
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," If I could give zero stars, I would
","First, the upside of this movie---the costuming, the sets, the look of 1969 Hollywood is excellent. The actors are obviously having fun with the movie and show that good actors can make even crap material look good.The downside of this movie---it's boring. It's nearly 3 hours of meandering camera shots, extremely drawn out, irrelevant scenes. There isn't really any plot to the movie. It's not a spoiler to say that the premise of the story is that some actors' lives intersect with the Manson Family. That's in all the movie trailers. I mean, Sharon Tate is one of the main features of the movie so you know that the Manson gang is going to be in the story.But, once again we go back to the fact that there really isn't any story here. It's just the director moving the camera around, watching people do uninteresting things, linking together scenes that really don't interrelate, almost none of them advancing anything that resembles a plot that would draw the viewer in. I actually fell asleep during the movie at one point and I'm certain that plenty of other people in the theater I was at were also catching up on their rest.The end of the movie is clever but by then the viewer has blown nearly 3 hours of his lifespan that he'll never get back. It's not worth it.",1,19,38,3 August 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," excellent
","'2001' remains probably the best science fiction movie ever made.  It is one of the few movies around that makes you think, and was made not with the intent of giving the audience any answers, but in asking them questions.I would agree that reading Arthur C. Clarke's book version (which isn't just a novelization of the movie but was written parallel to the movie; for instance, in the movie the astronauts go to Jupiter but in the book they go to Saturn) is very useful in understanding what happens in this movie. SPOILERS-------The premise is very simple.  Alien beings have decided to assist in and then monitor human evolution.  The ape men at the beginning of the movie are vegaterians, going hungry not realizing that they can eat the animals what wander around their camp.  They cannot defend themselves against predators or even against a rival clan that drives them away from their watering hole. The Obelisk appears and the Obelisk teaches the ape men how to start using tools.  Armed with this knowledge, the ape men now become carnivores and start eating the abundant animals and then use their superior weaponry to drive off the rival clan and reclaim the pool of water----and note that one of the astronauts in the latter part of the movie is 'Frank Poole.'The movie then cuts to the future and scientists have found another Obelisk deliberately buried on the Moon by the aliens.  When sunlight hits the Obelisk, it sends out a signal towards Jupiter.  The signal is a beacon to the aliens who now know that humanity has progressed enough to go to the Moon and dig up the Obelisk.  En route to the Moon the astronauts have to deal with their supercomputer, HAL 9000.  HAL is supposedly incapable of error and yet makes a mistake which will jeopardize the mission.  Unable to trust HAL to run the ship anymore, the astronauts have to turn off his higher functions.  HAL discovers the plot though and murders all but one of the astronauts.  The surviving astronaut is able to defeat HAL by turning off his higher functions----hitting him on the head if you will, just as the ape man in the beginning of the movie defeated his opponent by hitting him on the head.
The ship arrives at Jupiter to find another Obelisk orbiting the planet. The astronaut lands a craft on the Obelisk and is whisked away through some sort of wormhole or time warp until he is taken captive, if you will, by the aliens.  He lives out the remainder of his life in this new place (or his life is accellerated by the aliens) and at his death the Obelisk appears again, this time to transform the astronaut into a super-being, the Starchild, who has nearly an infinite intellect and thus little need for a body, the final stage of human evolution.This is certainly not a movie that anyone can immediately understand after the first viewing or even after multiple viewings.  Perhaps others will disagree with me about what the movie's plot is or what the movie ultimately means.  The dangers of technology permeate the movie as well---the ape man's primitive technology is used to destroy his enemy but in the future man's technology has developed a mind of its own and decides to destroy Man to save itself (the same premise used in 'The Terminator' series).Yes, the movie probably could've dispensed with a lot of the psychedelic stuff at the end (essentially the same sort of time warp/wormhole travel that is used in the movie 'Contact' and probably to better and more understandable effect).  I thought that the acting left something to be desired; none of the actors were well-known to American audiences and none of them went on to have notable careers--but I don't think the movie would've been all that much better had some superstar of the day, say Charlton Heston, played the astronaut's role.  In the end, it is a movie that demands that the viewer think about what is happening and think about it for a long time afterwards.  There aren't many movies that did that then, or do that now.",Null,4,8,24 June 2003
12 Years a Slave," 2 hours of sadism
","I was hoping to really enjoy '12 Years a Slave' but wasn't expecting a 2 hr long movie of very long, ponderous slow camera shots of nature and hardly any compelling dialog or character development. This was then broken up seemingly every 10 minutes by a savage flogging or a vicious rape or some other sadistic cruelty being inflicted on the movie's hero, the hapless Solomon a freeman sold into slavery, and the other slaves. Except for Brad Pitt's Canadian abolitionist and a gentleman from Solomon's home town, virtually every white character in this movie is portrayed as the very embodiment of evil. No nuance, nothing but unremitting sadism.A lot of people seem to be comparing this movie to 'Schindler's List' although I can't understand why. In 'List' you had the compelling story of Schindler who, for reasons known only to himself, risks his life to save as many Jews as he can. The Jewish prisoners are depicted as full characters, people you know and care about. Even the Nazi played by Ralph Finnes is given some depth, a man whose cruelty has been unleashed and sanctioned by his Nazi bosses but, you suspect but for the war would be a man who might be interesting to be around---a lover of fine food, good wine and a roving eye for the women. But the slave masters in '12 Years a Slave' don't have the slightest hint of anything human about them, just treating people with cruelty for cruelty's sake.If filmmakers really wanted to make a powerful movie about slavery, they might consider boldly making a new version of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' and hew closely to the story that Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote. It's a powerful book and it gets far deeper into the immorality of slavery than anything like '12 Years a Slave' does. The memoirs that '12' was based on came out soon after the huge success of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'. The opening scene of the slave-traders benignly discussing their 'wares' in 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' was so chilling to read that I couldn't even bear to read it through in one sitting. '12' had a similar scene with the excellent Paul Giamatti as a slave-trader, but the movie never got any deeper.",2,144,257,24 November 2013
Ben-Hur," simply outstanding film-making
","'Ben-Hur' has always been one of my favorite movies and I find it a very emotional experience every time I see it. 'A Tale of the Christ', I would suggest that while Judah Ben-Hur is in nearly every scene, the central character of the entire movie is Jesus Christ.The lives of Judah Ben-Hur and Jesus Christ parallel each other. They're about the same age and later in the movie one of the Magi meets Judah with the hope that he is the Christ Child now grown to manhood. Just prior to Christ's return to Jerusalem and the Crucifixion, Judah narrowly escapes death in the spectacular chariot race (17 of the greatest minutes in the history of film-making) and is cynically hailed by Pontius Pilate as the Jewish people's 'one true god.' Discovering that his mother & sister are not dead but are lepers, Judah is on the verge of using his fame and fortune to lead a revolt against the Romans. But Christ leads the true revolt and through His sacrifice, heals Judah's family of leprosy and Judah of his thirst for revenge.There are several very emotional scenes throughout the movie and aspect of the movie is terrific. A stirring musical score, sterling acting by everyone in the cast but in particular by Charlton Heston and Hugh Griffith who received deserved Oscars and by Stephen Boyd and Jack Hawkins who could have received Oscars as well. The finest performances of their careers. Tremendous costumes, great dialog, and the centerpiece of the movie, the thrilling chariot race.'Ben-Hur' won 11 Oscars, a feat matched only by 'Titanic'. Both are examples of epic film-making but 'Ben-Hur' will always remain the standard by which all epics will be measured.",10,1,3,22 February 2007
Godzilla," unwatchable
","Certainly one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Hammy, over the top acting (Bryan Cranston being the worst offender), silly story with so many plot holes that you feel like you've fallen into an illogical abyss. Godzilla only on screen for about 10 minutes and most of the time the monster looked like it was some guy in a suit. Just total, absolute drivel and not even very interesting drivel--I kept falling asleep even with all the explosions and Godzilla occasionally roaring. At least four Oscar-nominated actors in this movie---Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn and Juliette Binoche. They must've really needed a paycheck to stoop to this. Bryan Cranston's performance I thought was so amateurish I had to wonder, is this the guy everyone's talked about for being such a great actor in 'Breaking Bad'?",1,2,11,22 May 2014
Cloud Atlas," ponderous, pretentious and sleep-inducing
","'Cloud Atlas' was the longest three hours I've spent in a movie theater in a long, long time. Twice I had to hold myself back from walking out. The theme, if you can finally figure it out, is that love and relationships endure throughout time and the heroes or the spirits of the heroes keep showing up in different times in history. But rather show things in some sort of sequence, the movie cuts back and forth from time and place without any warning. You have to keep track of about a half dozen different stories, multiple characters played by the same actors and finally you just throw up your hands and give up. Even if you could figure out the storyline, there's nothing original about it. Oh, and bring a translation book since about 25% of the dialog is in some sort of pidgin-English invented for the movie.I don't mind movies occasionally trying to shake up the traditional narrative; 'Memento' was an outstandingly original twist on the conventional storytelling. But 'Cloud Atlas' is not only confusing, it's ponderous, grindingly slow, gratuitously violent, self-important and dull. It cost $100 million to make and it'll no doubt enter the ranks of one of the most expensive flops in movie history. It's not even forgettable---the story is so unintelligible that you really don't have anything to forget when you leave the theater.",1,163,298,31 October 2012
Thirteen Days," Taut Thriller
","This is an outstanding re-telling of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The weakest part of the movie of course is Kevin Costner who wisely cast himself in the part of presidential assistant Kenny O'Donnell rather than take on the JFK role. In order to give Costner a lot to do they make Kenny O'Donnell out to be a sort of behind-the-scenes king-maker rather than the office gofer that he probably really was. But it was a clever device to get the audience into the inner workings of the Kennedy White House without making JFK or RFK the lead character. The scenes that work best are when O'Donnell is the fly-on-the-wall sitting in at Cabinet meetings and meetings with the Joint Chiefs and letting the real decision-makers and advisers talk.Much of the real JFK Cabinet discussions were recorded or transcribed for history and so I'm sure that much of the dialog for those scenes is what the principals really said. The movie is a tremendous look at crisis management and decision-making under extreme pressure.The military leaders are made out to be the semi-villains in this movie, pushing JFK to attack Cuba and launch WWIII and at some points seeming to even disobey or skirt his orders. When watching the movie I kept remembering that JFK was the youngest man ever elected president and that he was only 45 yrs old when this happened. Most of his Cabinet and all of the Joint Chiefs were much older than him and that tension comes across as the older men seem to barely be able to hold back their condescending attitudes towards the young president.With the exception of Costner, the acting in this movie is first rate and Bruce Greenwood as JFK was certainly deserving of Oscar consideration. It is always hard for an actor to play a historical figure like JFK who is more legend now than man. Greenwood wisely does not try to mimic JFK's accent but he does get inside the character and you can see JFK thinking his way through the crisis with nothing less than future of the entire human race riding on his decisions. Steven Culp was outstanding as well as RFK, perfectly mimicking RFK's mannerisms and way of speaking but again, getting inside the character so we can really see the man rather than just an impersonation. The success of the entire movie depending on Greenwood and Culp nailing their parts and they did so terrifically.Viewers might be interested in finding a copy of 'Missiles of October' which was a TV-movie in the 1970s and done much like a stage play. William Devane played JFK and Martin Sheen RFK. The movie also gave much screen time to the Kruschev character.",Null,60,75,8 April 2002
Contact," reverse witch-hunt
","Is there any other contemporary movie that has as much disdain and contempt for religion than 'Contact'?  Without exception every Christian character in this movie is portrayed as a caricature---narrow minded, bigoted, arrogant, even murderous in their attempts to stop science in its march.  Even the main religious character, Palmer, is a cipher.  He's more of a philosopher who believes in God but the movie carefully does not align him with any particular faith. The anti-religion tone of the movie spoiled it for me.  Ellie Arroway is set up as a sort of modern-day Galileo and the Christians try to get her to recant her belief in her worm-hole experience.  Of course in the end Ellie has nothing but her faith in the experience to 'prove' that it happened. But of course what she doesn't know is that there is some physical proof of her experience---but the believers and the government have hidden it from her and the public.  But this has to be expected from anything from Carl Sagan.  Sagan could barely contain his disdain for religious faith during his life.  He may be thinking differently now though.",Null,0,4,8 May 2002
