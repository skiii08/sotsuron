It," It was okay but miniseries is better
","Even though it's dated and the ending is cheesy, I like the 1990 miniseries much better. This adaptation is okay, but that's about it. The acting is fine and so is the cinematography. I thought it relied too much on jump scares and CGI in my opinion. Bill Skarsgard is a decent Pennywise, but the heavy use of CGI ruined the character. Tim Curry's Pennywise was funny, cynical, and scary all at the same time. I may be biased here because I'm a fan of Curry. To be honest, the scenes with Bev and her father made me way more uncomfortable than any of the Pennywise scenes. I won't go into detail because I don't want to give out any spoilers. I know a lot of people are complaining about the use of profanity by the kids, but that didn't bother me. A lot of people are complaining about the overuse of jump scares and CGI. That didn't bother me as much as it did others. It just left me disappointed. What bothered me the most was the sexualization of Bev. I know people are going to call me a 'femenazi' or a 'snowflake' for saying this, but it's how I feel. In the miniseries, Bev was an average geeky child. You could tell the boys were interested in her and it didn't require her to be in her underwear. I'm sorry but it just made me feel icky. No disrespect to the actress, but I hate how she was portrayed in this version of IT. Also, the comments I'm seeing about her looks just adds to the ick factor for me. All in all, 2017 IT isn't terrible, but it's not great either. I'll just stick to the original 1990 miniseries.",5,2,7,17 September 2017
