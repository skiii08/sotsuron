The Legend of Bagger Vance," This movie is NOT about GOLF!
","It's about LIFE. If you don't realize that, you probably won't enjoy it. That being said, this film is one of my favorites of the year. The acting is very good, especially by Damon and Smith. Charlize Theron, who I began admiring from 'Devil's Advocate', is passable here but she has some problems with the accent.The cinematography and costume design are all top-notch.
I'll admit, I thought this was a movie about golf until I saw the whole thing through. I am not an avid golf fan, though I played a little in school and used to watch some of it on TV, to relax. So I wasn't exactly revved up to see the film.However, it won me over. The style, mood, and metaphors really blew me away. The story is slighly cliched, if only for the existence of movies like 'The Natural', which also featured an older guy returning to a sport he previously excelled at, with a blonde woman cheering him on from the sidelines. But where 'The Natural' was a fantasy and didn't have much of a message, '...Bagger Vance' digs deeper and has more of a philosophy behind it. And if you think you can predict who will win the golf tournament in the end, you are wrong.Do yourself a favor - be open minded and go see a movie that happens to use golf as a way of giving its message.",10,0,1,4 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than I thought....
","I'm not a big Star Wars fan (though I did see the first 3 films), so I wasn't in a rush to see this one.  But it was much better than I thought. With over 1000 user comments, everything's probably been said already.  So here are my comments, fast and furious:<ul><li>Natalie Portman is luminous in this film.  Resembling a young Julia Roberts, I couldn't take my eyes off of her.  A star is born.</li></ul><ul><li>What's up with the girl wearing braces in the scene with the kids and Ani Skywalker before the pod race?  They have orthodontia in their universe?!?!</li></ul><ul><li>The pod race was definitely the highlight for me.</li></ul><ul><li>Jar Jar Binks was annoying but I did like his battle scene antics.  Very amusing.  Hated his speech-- I couldn't understand half of what he said. This is probably intentional so as to get more second- and third-time viewers. ;) Since I knew he was computer generated, I found myself distracted whenever he appeared-- trying to see if I could tell the difference between him and the real people.  Mostly I couldn't.  But Liam and the kid once look sort of in the wrong direction when Jar Jar speaks.</li></ul><ul><li>The plot of the movie was hard to follow (but then, I even have trouble with James Bond movies).  At the beginning, with the taxation without representation thing, I was like, 'What is this, the American Revolution?' I could tell the good guys from the bad guys, but that's about all I could figure out.  Again, this is probably intentional so as to get more second- and third-time viewers. ;)</li></ul><ul><li>Another 'mistake' (probably also in the other Star Wars movies)-- they call their star(s) 'the sun'.  That's an 'earth' thing.  There is no reason to assume that every solar system refers to their star as 'the sun'.  They should have another name for it (too picky?).</li></ul><ul><li>Who tought Yoda how to speak English?  Stevie Nicks? (listen to her song 'Long Time To Go' and you'll know what I'm talking about). ;)</li></ul>Overall rating: 7 out of 10.  Worth seeing.",7,0,0,4 July 1999
Ali," Not the greatest movie about The Greatest, but pretty damn good.
","Just a few comments to balance out what others have said:Will Smith already proved in 'Six Degrees of Separation' that he CAN act. He was very good here. Not Oscar-worthy in my opinion, but a very good job nonetheless. More impressive for me were Jamie Foxx (who also impressed me a lot in 'Any Given Sunday') and Nona Gaye (who I didn't know had any acting talent at all - but I guess she does).This movie, like a lot of Michael Mann films, sets a tone, an atmosphere, and goes with it. That's the reason for overlong scenes like the opening nightclub scene and the jog in Zaire. Tell me that after the opening scene, you didn't get a great feel for the 60's - the period in which most of this movie takes place.I will defend the jog in Zaire scene too - Roger Ebert even complained that it went on too long. But during the scene, I was thinking lots of things - 'I wonder what Ali is thinking?' 'I guess he's thinking of how different his life is than these poor people. He's thinking how much of a hero he has become to people he doesn't even know. How much responsibility he has to win the fight because these people all support him. How Africa is his peoples' homeland and how he's basically come home.' All those thoughts went through my head and I think that's exactly what Michael Mann intended. The scene NEEDED to run on and on to convey all those different thoughts and ideas.At the end, I admit I was a little disappointed because I had hoped the film would cover more of Ali's recent life including battling Parkinson's disease. But I guess that's for Ali 2.",7,0,0,30 December 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Extremely disappointing
","Pirates 2 is an extremely overlong, disappointing mess of a movie. It's about 1 hour too long. At 90 minutes, this film could have been very good. The effects are good, the makeup is outstanding, but there is no story to speak of. The acting is passable, saved mostly by Keira Knightly who, like in the first film, acts everyone off the screen.I didn't stay for the 'extra scene after the credits' - I was already exhausted by the film. The ending was disappointing - even though I knew there was a twist coming, I didn't know what. My idea for a BETTER twist (and what I thought was actually coming) is to have Tia Dalma say that SHE will captain the ship that will go to find Jack. THEN you'd have me lining up for Pirates 3 tickets. As it stands now, with an old retreaded character promising to appear in Pirates 3, I am finished with this series for good.Save your money and see it on DVD if you must.",5,3,5,15 August 2006
Troy," ONE OF THE WORST FILMS I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME
","This movie is so bad that I kept looking for the little guys at the bottom of the screen, for I was sure I was watching an episode of 'Mystery Science Theatre 3000'.I cannot begin to describe everything that is wrong with this film. Others have already done so many times over. Please read Roger Ebert's review - he nails it on the head but is still much too kind. This movie is boring, too long, and has virtually no redeeming qualities. I NEVER walk out of movies, no matter how bad they are. Last night, while watching 'Troy', I was tempted. In fact, the desperation, confusion, and uncertainty in my trying to decide whether to leave at about the 45-minute mark was more moving and involving than anything in the film! Alas, I stayed, and hence lost 2:40 of my life and $7 of my money (I used a pass).Never mind whether ancient Greeks should be introspective (although if you believe in anything Julian Jaynes said, they probably even COULDN'T do so), this entire production was a waste of time. I can't even imagine anyone watching the dailies and thinking, 'yes, that's good'. This movie makes 'Gladiator' look like the best movie ever made, simply because it succeeded in bringing an ancient civilization to life. After watching 'Troy', you will have no clue as to what life was like in ancient Greece.Brad Pitt and Eric Bana do a decent job with what they are given. The young woman playing Achilles' Trojan 'love-slave' (I forget her name) gives perhaps the only really great performance in this movie. Peter O'Toole thinks that going bug-eyed somehow conveys some emotion, and Julie Christie is virtually unrecognizable. The woman playing Helen of Troy is not nearly beautiful enough and is a terrible actress.Save your money. Save your time. PLEASE - you are now warned as I was not fortunate enough to be. Rating: 4 out of 10.",4,1,5,14 June 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Lots of homages to other films...
","Instead of reviewing this movie, I thought I'd mention that it is chock full of scenes featuring homages to previous films. For some reason, none of these are listed in the 'Movie Connections' section of iMDB. Here are the ones I noticed (*** possible spoilers ***):'Close Encounters...' - floor cleaner opening door with bright light behind it'Titanic' - going downstairs to use the payphone in a flooded hallway'Poseidon Adventure' - guy hanging into shopping mall and ultimately falling'Planet of the Apes' - top half of Statue of Liberty sticking out of the ground'The Matrix' - jumping over the crack in the ice in Antarctica'Twister' - tornado scenes in Los Angeles'The Perfect Storm' - shot of wave approaching Manhattan",7,0,0,11 June 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Not as great as I was led to believe...
","Perhaps I'm in the minority... OK, yes, I am definitely in the minority, but I just saw 'Lord of the Rings' yesterday and am still wondering what all the fuss is about?Yes, the movie is technically brilliant, from special effects, to art direction, to cinematography. But the story didn't move me at all.I admit I am NOT a fan of fantasy - 'Star Wars' left me similarly unmoved. But to say that 'Lord...' is one of the greatest movies of all time is confusing to me. And it's not just IMDB voters but movie critics alike.One thing I noticed in the film (and since I have not read the book except for 'The Hobbit' I don't know if this is similar) is a lot of homoeroticism. I wonder if I'm just reading something into it or was my mind wandering so much that I had to think of subtext, or what? Did anyone else notice this? From the opening 'smoke rings' sequence (Gandolf's smoke boat goes into Bilbo's smoke ring) to the lack of female characters, to the womb-like 'evil eye', to men convincing other men to stay with the men and not go with the women...Anyway, I give the movie 7 out of 10 stars (normally I'd give it 8 but it's overrated here so it needs a bit of reality).",9,0,0,12 February 2002
American Beauty," Thoughtful, intelligent, and disturbing...
","Rather than re-hash what has already been said, I will comment further.  I give this movie 9 out of 10 points.  It has tremendously solid acting, cinematography, and direction-- there is not a wasted scene in 2 hours. Critics have been comparing this film to 'Ordinary People', but I can't say I felt the same emotional connection to the characters in 'American Beauty' as I did in 'Ordinary People'-- probably because of the comic elements.I believe this film really is about things not being what they seem.  Think about it-- no one in the movie is really what they seem to be.  Even in death, Wes Bentley sees happiness on the face of Kevin Spacey (one of many moments emphasizing this point).For all the predictors of Oscars galore, please remember that 'The Ice Storm' was shut out at Oscar nomination time.  For the same reason, I predict this film will receive one or two nominations at most.  Sad, but true.",9,0,0,29 September 1999
1941," Absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever
","Steven Spielberg is my favorite director, but clearly '1941' is his worst film. It would be any director's worst film, and is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen (and I've seen a lot of them). If I could give it 0 out of 10, I would, but IMDb forces me to give it at least a 1. I couldn't possibly check off 'contains spoiler' because there is no plot to spoil! Basically, here's the formula: take a bunch of TV actors (John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, Joe Flaherty, Lenny & Squiggy, Wendy Jo Sperber, Robert Stack, etc.), lose the script because there's no need for any plot or character development, and even though it's a comedy, you don't need any jokes - just blow something up with really expensive special effects or have things crash around the actors when you want to make people laugh.Frankly I really don't see how this even got past the concept phase. Someone somewhere was afraid to say 'No.' I am writing this review only to warn people out there - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS MOVIE! I watched it through to completion (albeit having to read a magazine to keep my sanity during the last half-hour) only because I love Steven Spielberg and wanted to see every one of his films.You have been warned.",1,30,54,8 March 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The worst movie I have seen this year...
","I was really looking forward to The Two Towers. I thought that 'Fellowship of the Ring' was good, but just so-so. Certainly not worth all the hype and Oscar nominations.This film bored me to tears for the first 2 hours. The last hour was good - if only the rest of the film could have been as interesting. I literally almost walked out of the theatre during the first two hours - and I NEVER walk out on movies.I can't believe it was nominated for Best Picture this year. I can't believe that everyone who voted for it actually SAT THROUGH it! No way!Yes, the cinematography, sound, and other technical aspects are all top notch. But that doesn't make up for the flaws, namely:<ul><li>lack of a plot - or at least an understandable plot</li></ul><ul><li>lack of a reprise (however briefly) of what happened in the first movie to remind stupid people like me where we are in the story. I couldn't follow what was going on.</li></ul><ul><li>way too too too long</li></ul><ul><li>many elements seemed stolen from other films - perhaps they were visualized as they were in the book, but since I haven't read the book I don't know. Moving trees like in 'Wizard of Oz'. Gollum is the same as Dobby from 'Harry Potter'. The dwarf with the height problem is really identical to Hagrid from same 'Harry Potter'. Even the big elephants reminded me of the huge walking things from 'The Empire Strikes Back.'</li></ul>If you want to see beautiful footage of New Zealand, watch the Travel Channel. The ONLY saving grace out of this whole movie was Sean Astin, whom, as in the first one, is the only one who seems to be really emoting and who seems to understand what he is saying. He is a great actor.I want my 3 hours back!!!",8,0,0,17 February 2003
Million Dollar Baby," Good acting but generally overrated
","I wanted to like this movie, especially since I am a fan of Clint Eastwood as a director and Hilary Swank as an actress. The previews didn't interest me at all - but the almost universal praise heaped on this film did make me want to see it.I agree with the reviewer who said the film felt 'scripted' - not only that, but watching scenes (near the beginning) with Clint and Morgan were like watching people 'act' and 'play the scene'. Hilary Swank saves the day with her performance, believable and truthful. Clint's work later in the film is exemplary. Morgan Freeman is, well, Morgan Freeman, and here he plays simply a variation on his 'Driving Miss Daisy' character, mumbling through some scenes making his words incomprehensible.I didn't feel an emotional connection to this film at all - I don't see it as 'Clint's masterpiece' at all - 'Mystic River' is a far superior film, which had me extremely emotionally involved. The Morgan Freeman voice-over really got on my nerves very early on. I am not a fan of voice-over - I believe it's an easy way out of explaining things rather than SHOWING them.I can't understand all the hype about MDB - I really can't. I give it (a very generous) 7 out of 10.",7,7,13,16 January 2005
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," 7 out of 10, but for Harry Potter fans only
","I'm giving this a 7 out of 10, and that is generous - and I do this to say that Harry Potter fans will need to see this (I assume they will see all the films) but others (casual fans, people who are just looking for a random film to see) will not understand nor like this film.I will second what most of the critical pans of this film say, and that's that a lot of the book's important plot and themes were glossed over in favor of trying to cover too much in too little time. Even at 2:40, the movie definitely dragged, and yet they try to capture key plot points in 5 seconds at best. It seemed that they filmed a lot more than was shown, and edited out everything that seemed not 100% necessary to explain what was happening. However, adding a line here or there COULD have explained enough to the casual fan. For example, why not say that the Weasley Twins decided to quit school and go into business? That's one line of dialogue - and it would help explain why they would risk expulsion by flying through the OWL exam room making fireworks.In the book, Harry getting kicked out of Hogwarts was a BIG DEAL. That's his ENTIRE LIFE - yes, it's a big deal. In the film, he's mildly upset, and quickly gets voted back in. In the book, Umbridge takes each teacher, one by one, to task and humiliates them in front of their own classes. In the film, she speaks one line in each class, and we're supposed to see that as bad behavior.Very disappointing. How Yates gets the next HP movie before this one was even released is beyond me. Perhaps he learned something from this one, however, and the next one will be better.",7,1,2,19 August 2007
Toy Story 2," I must be from another planet...
","but I hated this movie.  I don't really see what everyone is gushing about. I liked the first one, but this one adds NOTHING to the theme. I saw no reason for the filmmakers to produce a sequel (other than to make money) and this film has no purpose or point.  Yes, the animation is outstanding, but so was the animation in the first one.  The only good point was the 'music video' sequence of the cowgirl's past performed to a beautiful Sarah McLauchlin song.  Otherwise, I didn't laugh out loud once.  I was bored silly.  I rated this movie a 4 out of 10... my lowest rating ever on IMDb. In fact, the only movie I've seen ever that I rate lower is 'Beautiful Mystery' (don't ask).TAKE MY ADVICE-- DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS OVERRATED AND MEANINGLESS SEQUEL!",4,7,19,30 December 1999
The Red Violin," Interesting... to say the least...
","Hmmm... Let's watch 'The Red Violin' -  the movie that came out of nowhere and won the Best Score Oscar a couple of years ago.OK - typical story of an object through the years... but wait... it's told in a unique fashion - with clips of various timeframes - now and then - sort of like The English Patient - and it works.This movie is much better than I thought - held my interest - each of the stories is interesting, and tied together nicely by the tarot card reader. The music, of course, is outstanding.Why didn't this movie get a wider distribution? Why did it surprise me at the Oscars when it won Best Score? Why had I never heard of it until then? You tell me.Rating: 8/10 stars.",8,0,0,21 January 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Thought-provoking and visually stunning erotic thriller.
","Stanley Kubrick's last film, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a thought-provoking and visually stunning erotic thriller.  Kubrick will undoubtedly be nominated for Best Director at next year's Oscars (which overlooked him for winning that prize his entire career).Kubrick's trademark camera moves, colors, and sets are all here-- they reminded me a lot of 'The Shining'.Ultimately this film is about fidelity in marriage-- not sexual perversion, or anything like that.  I didn't expect this kind of theme, but it works well and proves more 'adult' than any kind of blatant eroticism would be. 
Nicole Kidman gives the best performance in the film, despite the slow-talking that, contrary to another user comment, actually starts in the scene where she is drunk and dancing with the older man. 
My criticisms of the film are that, at 2:45, it is way too long.  It slows down considerably and could have used about 30 minutes edited out.  The slow speech of all the characters, near the end, becomes.... really.... annoying. So does the soundtrack, which, though effective in some scenes.... gets on your nerves.Overall, a nice effort, and worth seeing-- 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,27 July 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," An extremely disappointing sequel...
","I loved The Matrix. I have it on tape at home and have seen it many times. It holds up extremely well and all the logic is consistent within itself (in other words, nothing happens in the film that can't be explained within the context of the rules of the film). It was clever and witty and funny at times and filled with great action.Now we get 'The Matrix Reloaded', an extremely disappointing sequel.
Before we get to the bad, let's examine the good (some contain spoilers):<ul><li>I liked the fight scene with the clones- well done</li></ul><ul><li>The woman who leads them to the Keymaker was very interesting and well-acted</li></ul>Here are my complaints (some contain spoilers):<ul><li>the film has no sense of humor; no attempts at jokes were made until the last half of the film</li></ul><ul><li>the action scenes were overdone; most of the action scenes looked like they came right out of a James Bond movie</li></ul><ul><li>the extreme powers of Neo in this film take away all suspense - if he can win any fight, then what is there for us to cheer for?</li></ul><ul><li>the fight with the clones should have happened near the end - that's the ultimate fight that would create suspense; after this fight, it's obvious that Neo can beat anyone in a fist fight</li></ul><ul><li>if it's the year 2999 and they know that the only way to beat the agents is to blow them up, why don't they make some kind of bomb instead of relying on cars blowing up?</li></ul><ul><li>one of the best parts of the original Matrix was the Oracle; now we find out that she wasn't even a real person? How disappointing...</li></ul><ul><li>the supporting characters were fairly boring and the acting not very good; the original had much better acting by the supporting characters; for example, The Keymaker had absolutely no reactions while on the back of Trinity's motorcycle even though she was dodging cars the whole time</li></ul>No, I didn't stay for the trailer for part 3 - at this point, the next part of the sequel is not on my 'to see' list.",5,0,0,23 June 2003
Paths of Glory," Crying out for a remake...
","This film has good intentions, and as an anti-war film in 1957, I'm sure it was groundbreaking. However, in 2007, it doesn't hold up. Stanley Kubrick is a genius and one of my favorite directors. So what's the problem? Simply put - the accents of the actors. American actors, a lot of them from New York, are playing French soldiers in World War I. I just can't get past their wooden and sometimes unintentionally funny delivery of lines - 'Youse don' understand, faddah, I don' wanna die!'.If this movie were made today, not only would they cast French actors, but it's likely it would be in French with subtitles, even if it were made by a US studio. Even casting British actors would have been better; somehow it's easier for us Americans to accept British accents for French, Romans, and all sorts of other nationalities.It's unfortunate because I can see that the direction, cinematography, screenplay, and all the rest are top-notch. But the film as a whole failed me.",5,5,25,16 August 2007
Tarzan," Disappointed...
","Despite the rave reviews of 'Tarzan', I must say I was disappointed by it. It pales in comparison to most of the recent Disney cartoons including the underrated 'Hunchback of Notre Dame'-- it's not quite in the same league as 'Beauty and the Beast' or 'The Lion King'.First, to make it clear to prospective viewers, this movie IS NOT A MUSICAL! I was very surprised by that.  Phil Collins' songs are sparsely featured throughout the film, but he sings them all.  I found that a bit jarring and it 'threw me off' for nearly the first 30 minutes of the film.The plot is thin at the start, but picks up when Jane arrives.  Minnie Driver's vocalization of Jane is definitely the highlight of the entire film.  She is perfect.The ending of the film I found a bit contrived.  Without trying to spoil the plot, let's just say I had trouble with the 'being in love' part-- I think a more likely reason for certain people to stay with Tarzan is that their life's work involving gorillas could be fulfilled.  There was no evidence of anyone being 'in love' throughout the movie.",6,0,2,28 June 1999
The Thin Red Line," Whew! I thought I was gonna be the only one that DIDN'T think this was a masterpiece!
","Thanks to imdb for restoring my sanity.  'The Thin Red Line' drew raves from critics and garnered 7 Oscar nominations, including the much coveted Best Picture nod.  I gave it a '7', but even my vote was probably an exaggeration.  I didn't really like this movie!  I thought I was in a bad mood (which I was), that I was tired (which I was), or that I just 'didn't get it' (which I didn't).  But it wasn't me after all-- it was the movie.I will compliment the cinematography and the basic story line.  I appreciate the film's message that 'nature is cruel' (to sum it up in 3 words).  The most annoying thing for me, however, was the over-use of the voiceover.  I don't usually mind voice-overs, but this was ridiculous.  By the end of the film, every time the voice-over came on, I wanted to shout, 'Oh, shut up! Already!'  Most of the voice-overs were unintelligible (poor sound, I guess). The ones for which I COULD understand the words were unintelligible to my brain because they seemed like some kind of psychobabble.  My guess is that these voice-overs came directly from the book.  If not, there is no reason whatsoever for them.Unfortunately even the message and execution of the film seemed a little dated and a little derivative.  What's in this movie that we haven't already seen in 'Platoon' and in 'Apocalypse Now'?  Not much.  It certainly wasn't original like 'Saving Private Ryan'.The performances were fairly solid, with the exception of two 'cameo' mistakes in casting-- John Travolta (who I absolutely LOVED in 'Primary Colors' and damn he didn't get nominated for it) was not believable as someone from the 1940s, and George Clooney, who, by the time he came on the screen, I was ready to accept anyone.",7,1,2,17 February 1999
Jackie Brown," Tarentino sure knows how to tell a story...
","Just saw this movie for the second time.  I loved it the first time and gave it 4 stars out of 4.  The second time, it held my interest as much as the first.  On IMDb I'm giving it 10 out of 10. The reason:  Quentin Tarentino sure knows how to tell a story.  All the characters are interesting (I can't believe the reviewers here that say they were bored!), the acting is first-rate (from everyone, including an understated Robert deNiro), and the direction and editing are is tight and neat.  Even the scenes that 'sound' boring on paper (like the ones at Bridget Fonda's apartment) are exciting and interesting because you just never know what's going to happen, and what these characters are up to.  This is one great movie!",9,0,1,19 January 2000
Gladiator," Lots of action, but little else...
","Overall, Gladiator rates a 7 out of 10 for me. Russell Crowe, one of the best lead actors of our day, gives a thoughtful performance and lends the role of Maximus a depth it almost doesn't deserve. Joaquin Phoenix is a revelation - when the credits began to roll, I looked for the name of the unknown British actor who gave the role of the Emperor true believability, and I was surprised to see Joaquin's name. The rest of the supporting cast, including Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, were excellent. Unfortunately Connie Nielsen's portrayal of the Emperor's sister failed to hit the right notes.The effects are astounding, and the recreation of the Colliseum in Rome is awe-inspiring. My favorite scenes, however, were viewing the 'skyline' of Rome itself from afar-- I don't think I've ever seen it so realistically portrayed-- I felt as if I were there.My main complaints lie in the movie's length (overly long at 2:30 and draggy in some parts) and the 'choppiness' of the action scenes. At the beginning, that fast-action/slow motion technique DOES make you feel as if you are one of the warriors, but its repeated use eventually makes you a little nauseated. As a result, you come away from the movie not remembering what you really saw in the action scenes.The opening battle scene could have been called 'Saving Private Maximus'. And much of the repeated head-chopping reminds one of 'Braveheart'. But 'Gladiator' doesn't live up to those superior films because it lacks the realism of Ryan's battle scenes, and the emotion of Braveheart.",7,0,0,26 May 2000
