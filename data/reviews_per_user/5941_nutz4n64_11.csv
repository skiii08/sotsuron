Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great movie requirements: Great special effects-check, Good story-check, Good actors-Houstin, we have a problem
","There are two good scenes in this whole movie.  One is the Pod race and the other is the battle with Darth Maul.  That's it.  I'm not what one would call a hardcore Star Wars nut, but I loved the first three.  So, of course, I was excited when Episode 1 was announced and when the first trailer came out.  Then, I grew rather skeptical of it.  The hype was huge and my excitement started to wane.  Of course, I still wanted to see it.  This is when I found out what the bad reviews referred to.  The effects were incredible, the action was cool, but the actors were lame.  In particular, Jake Lloyd.  This kid should've been coached better.  Plus, a scene that I think was totally unforgivable is when Anakin destroys the imperial fleet surrounding Naboo near the end.  Everything that he did looked like an accident.  The kid didn't look like he even knew what he was doing, yet he happens to push the right buttons by mistake.  Horrible.  George Lucas should feel shamed that he completely ruined the Star Wars universe.  Will I go to see Episode 2?  Yeah, but it had better be a big improvement over this.",5,0,1,21 December 1999
Wayne's World," Myers and Carvey are gnarly dude
","The first time I saw this one was when I got it as a gift from my parents when it was on sale at McDonalds.  I was relatively young and wanted it because my friends said to get it.  So basically, I hated it on the first viewing and hadn't watched it for a long time.  Recently, I saw the best of Mike Myers on SNL (who I now knew from Austin Powers).  There were clips of Wayne's World, which marks the very first time I've seen that skit on SNL. Also, about a month ago, I saw the sequel on USA.  OK, I can understand it now, so I decided to dig the original out of the box in my closet and watch it again.  It is now what I consider to be one of the best comedies ever. Myers and Carvey are perfect, the one-liners are awesome, and the Scooby-Doo ending is classic.  Like Austin Powers, see this movie and party on.",10,0,2,20 December 1999
Happy Gilmore," Best Sandler movie I've seen
","I have only seen two of Adam Sandler's movies, and this is definitely the better.  The acting was terrific on just about everyone's part (are we seeing a big difference from Waterboy hear?).  Anyway, Sandler is a complete loser that tries to become a hockey player.  The movie opens with a Wonder Years type sequence, in which we see Happy's youth years.  Flash forward to a hockey try out in which he kicks the coach's @$$.  I don't know about other people, but I thought that was hilarious.  That and the scenes where the people get hit by his first shots and the kid trying to take a baseball. The actors go about their routines so well that I just can't help but laugh.  Happy's first victory wins him a spot on the pro tour, trying to get enough money to get back his grandmother's house from the IRS.  Along the way, he meets his foe, Shooter McGavin.  The attitude Shooter carries does make him very unlikable and really makes you proud to see his butt get kicked.  Plus, Sandler's hotheadedness sets up many hilarious scenes, including one where Bob Barker kicks the crap out of him and where the censors have to work overtime whenever he misses a shot. We can be proud to know that Sandler makes better movies than The Waterboy.",9,1,1,18 January 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Makes the show look obsolete
","I heard about this movie last spring, and didn't know if it could possibly be such a good thing.  I pictured a cheap take on a great show and nothing more.  The time came.  I went to see it with my cousin, and laughed the whole way through.  This movie was brilliant.  They said that Trey and Matt broke free of their limitations from the censors in this one, and my dear God were they right.  Some of the best parts of the movie: Terrance and Phillip's song, Cartman being fitted with the V-chip, Mr. Mackey's song, oh what the heck, the entire movie was great.  South Park fan?  See this one right away if you haven't already.  And remember, marijuana is bad, mmkay.",10,0,0,11 January 2000
Batman Returns," A very dark sequel
","I saw this for the first time after seeing Batman Forever.  This one was still great.  The action at the beginning was very cool, and the plot was pretty good.  Michelle Pfeiffer, like all the Batman babes, was also hot. However, this one is a lot darker and more saddening.  Cat woman's insanity really makes me feel sorry for her.  Danny DeVito did good with his character as well.  I still think that the thing they had in common wasn't 'their contempt for Batman,' as Michelle put it, but that they had a very disturbed psyche.  A good movie, but expect a little sorrowful feel.",7,0,0,15 January 2000
Romeo + Juliet," Leo does Shakespeare. Oh, goody.
","I was first introduced to Shakespeare freshman year at high school.  Sure, it was a bit tough at first, but I got used to it.  Romeo and Juliet was a terrific play.  Then came the time in class when we would watch the video adaptations of this play.  We spent half the period on the '68 version, then half on this one, which went on for a few days.  The '68 version was very well done, and most of the class liked it.  Then we watched the 'new' one. I didn't know what to expect, but I thought it might be good.  Then I see the Montagues cruising the expressway in an open top convertable.  OK, so it's in modern times.  It might be good.  Then I heard them speak.  Dear God, what were they thinking?!I see this fight at a gas station where everyone looks like they're on speed and they shout these Shakespearean lines like they're normal for the time. I should've seen it coming when, instead of a narrator, a news caster does the prologue.  Great job.  Tip to the writers: if you're going to put Shakespeare in modern times, don't include the original lines.  'Draw the sword!'  What 'sword?'  I saw no sword in the movie.  I saw some guns.  Is this what Shakepeare would call guns nowadays?  And do I see news reports and beach parties where people actually speak in blank verse?  And let's not forget Leonardo DeCaprio.  How much more pathetic can his acting get?  I hardly saw any good actors in this movie.  I don't know why people would see this as 'good' entertainment.  Rarely do I ever give a 1 out of 10 to any movie, but this was just plain garbage.  If you want to see the real Romeo and Juliet, watch the '68 adaptation.  It is much more worthy to be called a work of Shakespeare's.",1,32,65,28 January 2000
American Pie," Brilliant
",The past two summers have been very good to me movie-wise.  'American Pie' was by far the best movie of the summer of '99.  There was barely a moment when I could stop laughing.  And the pie scene (I'm sure everyone knows what I'm talking about there)makes the 'Something About Mary' hair gel scene look like something out of a Walt Disney movie.  Do not miss this one.,10,1,2,12 November 1999
Toy Story," Why the trailer, why?
","I remember seeing all the trailers for this movie and thinking, 'Uggh, how stupid.  Why do they make movies like this?'  This was when I was in my macho mood.  Ya know, I've outgrown all this animated c%^p.  That was my attitude, so, of course, I avoided this movie for 4 years.  Just last year, Pokemon kinda broke me out of my 'macho mode' and brought me back to those simple pleasures.  Taught me not to hide the child in me.  So, my mom says we're taking care of my little cousin and wants to know if there's a movie out that we could see.  I mentioned Toy Story 2 (he and I already saw Pokemon, the most underrated movie of '99), but hadn't seen the first one. So, I drove over to his house to watch Toy Story.  Man, what I was missing. This is a terrific movie, but not because of the great animation.  The animation is cool, but like I've said, don't be that superficial that you judge the movies completely on animation.  It's the characters that matter, and this one had great characters.  Something that everyone must see.",9,0,0,15 January 2000
There's Something About Mary," Funniest movie of... uh, how long has Earth existed?
","I love comedies.  They are, without a doubt, the best genre of movies that exist.  I just like to go to a theater and laugh out loud, but rarely do I go hysterical.  That happened in my three visits to American Pie and when I just recently saw Porky's, but There's Something About Mary just stands above the rest.  I went to it with my cousin with some reluctance, but that was completely changed when we left the theater laughing out loud all the way home repeating the lines, 'Franks and Beans.'  'How'd you get the beans above the frank?'  'Isn't that an awful lot of speed to give one pooch?' And we'd laugh even more uncontrollably afterward.  Incredibly funny. 11/10",10,0,0,13 January 2000
The Waterboy," OK, but not too great
","I'll go on record by saying that this is the first Adam Sandler movie I've ever seen.  I went to it on my birthday (16) with my mom and three of my friends.  There was a choice between this and seeing 'There's Something About Mary' for my fourth time(their first).  Well, they said that I should see something different.  They (friends) came out laughing with huge smiles on their faces, saying how totally hilarious the movie was.  I, on the other hand, was a bit puzzled as to what they were laughing so hard about.  I laughed at some of the scenes, and the movie does come off as entertaining, but was it really that good?  Some of the great scenes were when Sandler held up traffic with his riding mower and when his mother tackled his father at the end.  It's good, but Sandler has had better movies than this.",2,1,1,17 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," What sort of bad thing can you say about a movie like this?
","The first time I ever heard anything about Star Wars was in the fifth grade. My uncle is definitely a crazed fan, so he bought it for me immediately when he heard I never saw it.  I can easily say one of the best movies of all time.  The story was incredibly good and the acting was terrific.  Very believable (unlike a certain episode 1 that we all know about).  This was a great start for the trilogy and shouldn't have been messed with in 1999. Oh, and I was equally impressed when I got the last ones too.  A must see above all others.",10,1,1,19 January 2000
