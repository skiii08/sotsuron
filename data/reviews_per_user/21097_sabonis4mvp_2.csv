Casablanca," , a person's emotions or feelings will change if and how the help others
","I liked this film because it did not only have an intriguing plot but it is also a very famous film and it was an educational experience watching it. I had heard of this film but had been lost when references were made to it or it was compared to another film. Having watched it has let me understand what everyone was talking about. I also liked it because it had a good mix of action, suspense, and romance. The action (like gunfights) was not over powering merely a backdrop for the plot. The suspense added to the story line and also kept my interest.  The romance was necessary for it made up the bulk of the conflict. I was satisfied with the conclusion of the romance at the end it was not melodramatic or gushy. Also this was the first time I had seen Humphrey Bogart in a film, like the film I had only heard of Bogart so again this added to enlightenment factor of the film.",Null,1,1,20 June 2002
Taxi Driver," Loneliness results in the need to prove existence
","I loved the film. The biggest reason why, is that unlike most movies involving death and violence, the viewer gets to experience the mind of the character, as well as the actions. In the film Travis keeps a diary this is often narrated letting the viewer see what the character is thinking and why. Another reason I enjoyed the film is that the plot was more realistic than a lot of films. This sense of realism made more of an impact on me for the emotions were not masked by a far-fetched plot or story, the plot reinforced the emotions and the emotions reinforced the plot. The genre Taxi Driver is in is ` Late 1970's: Psychological Portraits'. The violence that the Travis performs is tied back to the beginning of the film when the viewer learns of Travis' experience in the Marines and Vietnam. The disenchantment is focused on one character Travis Bickle who is fed up with the society and the environment that he is in. His troubled love life and loneliness are shown as a way to lead up to the action in result of the disenchantment.",Null,0,0,20 June 2002
