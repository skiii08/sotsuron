Vertigo," Overrated
",This film is vastly overrated because of myriad problems.#1. Kim Novak and Jimmy Stewart are atrocious. Stewart has the range of Farley Granger. Novak is a cardboard. (N.B. actually Hitch's 2nd choice but Vera Miles (Lila Crane in Psycho) became pregnant and pulled out.) #2 the themes are too personal and not universal or significant enough. This is about Hitchcock's 15th best.  True the cinematography is great but that is because he sacrificed substance in favor of style.  He was too concerned with creating a dreamlike ambiance to present a structured thematically-profound work.  It is the type of film to see but not analyze.,Null,3,7,1 March 1999
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Digressions...
","This is a truly superb film.  Whereas with pseudo-masterpieces like 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Apocalypse Now.' the message is so rhetorical and one-sided, the film achieves what art is supposed to: create a beautiful work that illuminates the truths that cannot merely be put into words, but must be experienced.  The complexity of the characters is amazing.  Alec Guinness realizes that this bridge is not going to win the war for the Axis. The bridge will be built either way. But here's a chance to create something good, here's a way to preserve human dignity in inhuman conditions.  When he gives that speech ('Years from now, when people uses this bridge, they will know that it was built by soldiers, British soldiers, not slaves') O my God, I get goosebumps.",Null,3,5,1 March 1999
