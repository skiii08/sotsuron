United 93," No character development
","It's a gimmicky movie, with lots of shaky cameras and faux panic. But this film wasn't really about anything. Who were the 'leaders' who let this all happen? We see self-important officials going to meetings and making excuses. But we never find out who any of them are. Who were the hijackers as individuals? We see them praying a bit in the opening scene, but we get no clues as to why they would sacrifice their lives. People don't just roll out of the mosque and decide to kill thousands of people. Who were the passengers who were supposed to be the heroes? No attempt to tell us. Just a few random white guys. I guess some people rate this movie highly out of some sort of patriotic duty. I can't imagine they weren't glad when this pointless film finally ended.",3,0,4,3 March 2007
