Sucker Punch," Waste of time and money
","I went into this thinking it looks awesome. I mean its got hot chicks with swords and guns kicking a%^. Visually the movie looks great. Well with out a coherent plot all that other stuff is meaningless. If had not checked out the previews and read a lil bit about the movie I would have been like wth what happen to the real world. From the previews I picked up that the shrink was trying to help her by working through these fantasies in her head. But where did that go I never saw it in the movie at all it went from the real world to a fantasy world, then another fantasy world with that one. And come on her big weapon in all of this is a stripper dance?! Now I love a good stripper dance but one that makes you oblivious to everything else come the movie industry can do better than that. And how they link these big fight scenes with all girls to them all being in a room with one chick dancing and another one trying to pick a guys pocket has no credible basis in the story. Even tho with out these good visual it would have even been more of a waste than it was. It like who ever wrote the plot was 12 and then whoever edited the movie was 12 and didn't want to have anything linking the pieces of the story together. Overall I think it had potential but they messed it up when writing the plot or they cut out a lot of the important storyline parts in the editing room.",3,5,11,1 April 2011
