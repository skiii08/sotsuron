Skyfall," Worst Bond Movie Ever.
","I went to see this movie cause of all the review I saw online. Even read one saying that the first half is good but the second half is a drag. I felt it the other way. There was action in the movie I am not denying that but the essence of a 'Bond' movie is not there. As the Bond franchise is huge, I will have to say this movie did not satisfy all the Hype it was given.There was no cool gadgets.No Bond Girls.Action sequence was not that good compared to Casino Royale.Pros:Just as a movie its good.",3,17,35,8 November 2012
