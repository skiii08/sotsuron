The Blair Witch Project," underrated
","I can't believe people didn't like this film, it was good to see a psychological horror that actually scared people and it's better than all this blood and guts which after a while can get extremely boring, some blood and guts horror films are good but when stuff like JASON X is being made it makes films like BLAIR WITCH look like an OSCAR winner.  I really enjoyed this film and in my opinion it's much scarier then films like SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.",8,0,1,27 November 2003
