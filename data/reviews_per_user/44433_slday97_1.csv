50 First Dates," Favorite Movie Thus Far...
","Personally, I LOVE this movie! The plot was original, funny, and absolutely adorable. No problems whatsoever with the acting as I believe that Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore have already proved themselves as satisfactory actors. 50 First Dates makes you laugh and cry and (pardon me for this) makes you feel all 'warm and fuzzy' inside. Just the idea that Adam Sandler's character could make Drew Barrymore's character fall in love with him on a daily basis that many times melts my heart. Would probably be considered a 'chick-flick' in the eyes of many, but I can say that hubby doesn't leave the room when I watch it! Definitely recommend it for anybody!!",10,6,10,8 September 2005
