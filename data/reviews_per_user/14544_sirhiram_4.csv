The Ring," What a boring stupid movie
","Some of the great horror movies in the past had some basis in reality.  This one had many minutes of footage without any dialogue or scenes that made sense.  It was trying to be artistic and instead ended up boring me and the rest of my family.  I found nothing scary about it except while watching it, I was under the constant fear that I would die of boredom.",1,1,5,16 November 2003
Reservoir Dogs," Disjointed, Unappealing Flick (Quasi-Spoiler)
","*Spoiler* Quentin Tarentino has the habit of using an uneven timeline for his movies. While I thought his subsequent movie, 'Pulp Fiction' was quite good, I wish he followed the timeline as the events occurred.  Sometimes it is necessary to jump around in time from scene to scene.  In this movie, it was unnecessary.  He could have easily started from the beginning and shown the movie in the order the events occurred.  The average moviegoer would not like this movie and would be more appealing to the avante garde film buff. While this movie is certainly original, that does not make it good.  The plot was difficult to follow and had minimal enjoyable moments.  While some of the scenes were intense, it is definitely not a feel good movie.",4,2,5,25 February 2003
Total Recall," One of Ah-nold's Best
","I am surprised that this movie did not get a better rating.  This ranks as one of the better Sci-Fi action films ever made.  The plot is very original and the movie is filled with great one-liners.  The characters are highly entertaining as is the action.  The production is so well done, it is easy to believe that this could actually happen.",10,1,4,25 February 2003
Back to the Future Part II," A little dated for today's audience
","Sequels seldom live up to the original and this movie is no exception. While certainly somewhat entertaining fare, the characters are unrealisticly inane which makes it difficult to really get involved with the plot.  Robert Zemekis admitted that they originally did not intend to make a sequel to the first one but the success of the first prompted this one.  Unfortunately, they decided to choose to make the movie too campy, thereby diminishing the drama that we had in the first one.",5,2,11,28 February 2003
