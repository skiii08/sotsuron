Mission: Impossible III," MI:3 Raises the Bar Again
","When you walk into a movie expecting to be blown away by death defying  stunts and tremendous special effects, it's easy to be disappointed.  What a monumental task directors had in making MI3 even more  over-the-top and more spectacular than the first two. Mission  Accomplished. (Sorry.)  Tom Cruise takes Ethan Hunt to new heights. Fishbourne is great as the  ambiguously dirty IMF leader. But the best actor in the movie is Philip  Seymour Hoffman. Not many actors can take a role that's more  one-dimensional than Doctor Evil and turn it into a deeply layered  performance. From an acting standpoint, there was almost a feeling that  he was too good for this movie and the actors around him. He doesn't  breathe the same air as this cast, not even Tom Cruise.  The women in the movie are a dichotomy. On the one hand you have Bahar  Soomekh, an unknown actress who kicks ass and takes names on par with  the bad boys, Cruise, and Ving Rhames. On the other you have Keri  Russell in a part we've seen too many times in this kind of movie. The  wide-eyed innocent who becomes the villain's prize and the hero's  salvation. Keri Russell and Michelle Monaghan spend most of this movie  tied to a chair. I hope they're not method actresses. They would have  to spend the last year of filming at home, bound and gagged in the  kitchen. At least they made Monaghan a doctor, so we know she's smart,  even if she's so naïve she thinks her husband works for the department  of transportation.   Forget the love story, forget the corruption at IMF, forget the plot  entirely. None of it matters. All that matters is 'how are we going to  get in' and 'how are we going to get out' and the magnificent twists  and turns that follow. Some action movies spend way too much time  milking the set up of a weak script before the explosions and the  stunts finally kick in. Others dull your senses with one mindless  montage of violence and car chases, without a point to be found. MI3  walks the line perfectlythe story is simple enough to understand but  well-thought out enough to not poke gaping holes in it. Now let's get  to the action.   MI3 manages the action sequences smartly, expertly getting your heart  rate (and hopes) up and then bring you crashing back down to earth. The  thrill of victory, the agony of defeat, followed by a 10 minutes of  blah blah blah.   'You shouldn't get married,' Ving says to Tom in the middle of a  dangerous operation. 'You know guys who do what we do can't be  married.' By the way, this is another well-worn action film technique.  Inject casual talk between principals during the most intense and  dangerous scenes. It shows that they're so highly-skilled and  confident, they can chat nonchalantly about relationships while in the  middle of an elaborate Vatican City break-in. Thank you Quentin. Thank  you Bruce Willis. But the breaks in the action work. They give you a  chance to buy into the suspense each time, from your feet up.  Acknowledging that you're drained from the previous sequence, they give  you time to catch your breath and then come at you all over again.  The air-to-ground assault on the Washington Bridge is astounding.  Cruise attempting to catapult between two skyscrapers in Shanghais is  beyond belief. Watching him descend way too fast from said skyscraper  in a flimsy parachute, knowing he's going to crash down onto the busy  freeway and immediately be run over by a gas tanker? Priceless.   Remarkable stunts, solid acting, and a villain that may be the best  ever in this genre (Hoffman) makes MI3 the best of the series and maybe  the best action movie ever made. Until 4, that is.",9,207,394,2 May 2006
