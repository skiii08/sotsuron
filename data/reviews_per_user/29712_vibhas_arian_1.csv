Captain Phillips," Tom Hanks made me feel the shock of being alive after all hope is lost ... !!!
","This movie went beyond my expectations. The matter of the fact is that tom hanks was the pulse of the movie, but the actors in the supporting role especially the Somali pirates were just awesome. The kind of weapons that they used, the language and the Somalian influence in their English was commendable. Of course they are from Somalia but i have to give them the credibility for that. The way Paul Greengrass has directed the movie is remarkable, it couldn't have been better.Tom hanks did his homework, studied the character. The kind of clothes that the original captain Phillips preferred the kind of footwear the body language and even the glasses that he wore, i could feel captain Phillips in Tom's performance. It is so beautifully directed and edited that at no point in the movie you feel OK so 'that scene does not need to be there', 'this is not good'. You feel everything is in place.All summed up, the movie is just awesome. But there are few scenes that make you wanna see this movie again. 3 for me were the talks between the Somalian captain and captain Phillips, the scene where they are about to shoot captain Phillips (blindfolded) and last but not the least the scene where captain Phillips undergoes medical procedure after being bought aboard. These scenes take the cake for me. My thanks and congratulations to the team of Captain Phillips to make such a masterpiece. Excellent, mind boggling, outstanding, i m running short of words actually.Tom Hanks made me feel the shock of being alive after all hope is lost ... !!!",10,2,4,11 January 2014
