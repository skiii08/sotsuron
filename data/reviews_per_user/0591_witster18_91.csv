National Treasure: Book of Secrets," fast paced intrigue.
","DId you like the first one? If so...then you'll love the sequel. I didn't WANT to like the first film.. like many movie goers I expected lots of cheese and little please but was pleasantly surprised with the original. It was good fun. I gave the first film a 6. The sequel is better. It doesn't need the character development of the first since we know the characters.. although it does add some fresh faces with two new roles played by powerhouses Ed Harris and Helen MIrren. I found 'book of Secrets' to be more of what made the original a good popcorn flick. Don't expect dramatic roles....don't expect a controversial ending... expect what you got the first time around only a bit better... If you were split on the first one give this a view. If you hated it, don't. Pretty straight forward recommendation. Not great...but good. 64/100",7,1,3,28 February 2008
First Man," Refreshingly real, deliberate take..
","First Man is not a film that will endear itself to younger audiences. The film is slower-paced and centers more on the emotional toll of everything that led to the first small step for man.I wanted to watch this film because i am a fan of the directors' previous work. I think this film sits on near the top shelf, below 'Whiplash', but not an eye-sore by any means.The film succeeds in some ways and fails in others. The film has a consistent, washed-out yet appropriate look for the time-period, and many(not all) of the visuals are spectacular. The music is solid(as to be expected from this director). The final 20-minutes is spine-tingling goodness. Each action sequence, while rare, is handled very well, and each of those moments is suspenseful and feels quite real. The aspect of creating danger and echoing that sentiment through the actions of the characters works here, but the film is far from perfect.Some visuals are a bit hacked - like the final rocket launch, and perhaps a bit too much unnecessarily over-used handheld camera-work.The film also fails to bring in emotion outside of the Armstrong household, and almost all the supporting characters feel like an oversight. To boot, the emotional weight of all of the Armstrong households' struggles, fail to hit the mark, perhaps due to a thin, under-written script. A private mans' home life seems as private and restrained as his media personality, and the film suffers because of it. It's not Gosling's fault, but realistic or not, when your lead character seemingly walks away speechless from every emotional moment, it doesn't help the impact nor the pacing of the film you're making. The ending suffers for it too.Overall, its still a good film, with solid visuals and really tense action sequences, great music, and solid-yet-restrained performances. I won't say I won't watch it again, bit I won't watch it again anytime soon.67/100You'll like it you liked(Thirteen Days - a touch below this), The Right Stuff(a clear notch above this), Indian Runner(a small notch above this), and Apollo 13(a small notch above this).",7,1,1,23 July 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," arrrrighty then...
","I'm not a huge fan of the series... I remember loving the first Pirates. I saw that one at the theater with my now wife. I remember sleepwalking through the second one. I caught bits and pieces of the third, but have still never really sat through the whole thing in one setting.Enough time had passed by to let me give this series a new chance last night. I was committed to going in without reading too much about it, and watching the film in its' entirety. There were many strengths and weaknesses here - so it might be best if I break it down that way.Strengths: Johnny Depp is still charming and witty, and Jack Sparrow has little to nothing to do with this series' decline.Penelope Cruz wasn't nearly as annoying as I usually find her to be.The set-up was decent.The film did showcase some nice visuals, and it had some really good ideas. The one that stands out is the first Mermaid sequence. It was a fresh take, and easily the most exciting scene in the entire movie.Weaknesses: I love Geoffrey Rush, but Barbossa as a character here is poorly written and has completely lost his backbone.Blackbeard is also poorly written and also seems a bit weak.While this isn't as long as some previous entries - it still seems overlong.Too many characters that are under-developed.The film suffers from some of the same, extremely unrealistic fantasy stuff, and I'm not talking about 'the Fountain of Youth'. I'm talking about Ropes that move on there own etc. These types of issues have seemed to get worse as the series moves on. I know it's a fantasy film, but Pirate lore is based in fact and I wish the entire series would have been a little more realistic. It could have still been fun.-------------------------------The good news is I made it through it. More good news is I won't again. The bad news is they'll make another. The really bad news is that many of us will pay to see it. I won't. I'm done with the series. Even though I missed much of the third installment - I think I can say with confidence that this thing hasn't been right since the original.44/100",4,0,0,13 December 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," the problem with this....was made when Lucas decided to scratch the realism.
","This isn't a terrible film. However, the decision of scrapping models and make-up for CGI.. distanced this film from the original trilogy both chronologically and in it's impact. Of course there are those that will say that 'technology has come along' ...or that, 'if you have it, why don't you use it?'.... problem is ...the old films still don't seem dated.....and the minimalized action scenes of the first trilogy still hold up EXTREMELY well.... so changing the formula didn't improve things... Considering this film had such a monumental task(cont. the series/intro to new characters), I found these changes in production completely separated the new trilogy from it's predecessors even further... This film is supposed to have been BEFORE Star Wars.....years before....I find that MANY elements of the film seem 'LIGHT YEARS AHEAD'...it quite honestly...makes no sense whatsoever to do this. It's like Lucas gave his geek squad free reign and decided that the original formula was outdated and would take too long to make......It's not like he didn't have the money....BUT IT IS LIKE he didn't have the time. Jar Jar Binks made the film feel more like a Sesame St. episode than a prequel to one of the greatest trilogies in modern film. Standing on it's own....this is an average action film...standing next to Star Wars and Empire....this is one of the biggest disappointments in my movie-going life. ....and the fact that Lucas has now fuddled with the original series proves that he has lost his touch. The escalated action scenes with their over-use of CGI and the distant characters have somehow made this less personal...less of an adult action movie.....and in the end ...less of a film. 48/100",5,30,55,31 October 2007
10 Cloverfield Lane," Soft 7 - gripping, interesting characters.. somewhat lackluster finish..
","The strongest thing that Cloverfield Lane has going for it is that the acting is good and it's probably a touch better than its predecessor. A TOuch! Maybe not too - I may have to watch this again. My initial thoughts on the original Cloverfield was that it was a 6/10, but after reviews, I up'd that to a 7. This may go the other way. It's close - they're actually 2 really different films - making me wonder if/why they didn't connect them in some way.The film quickly jumps right into the meat of the subject matter, and overall it doesn't feel as slow or as monotonous as other close-quartered devices. It is about the middle of the film that we get some justification for the situation; squashing some speculation and setting up what really could have been an epic finish.Unfortunately, low budget films like 'Southbound', 'Miracle Mile', or blockbusters like '12 Monkeys' handle similar situations with far more effectiveness in(terms of the ending) than does Cloverfield Lane.There's a few mistakes in the last 10 minutes that were a bit glaring, and the CGI, for a big-budget film like this, was a little below par.Fortunately, the rest of the film will keep you interested. It's SUPER early, but 10 Cloverfield Lane looks to be one of those that may, or may not stick around for the Top 25 of 2016.",7,2,3,21 June 2016
The Expendables 2," by order of the user agreement* SPOILER ALERT*there is no plot:)
","This film is reaching for some type of nostalgia that most of us won't understand. THe problem is I definitely understand,.. I grew up in the 80's, but this movie is still WAY over-rated on here at 7.1.There's loads of carnage, carnage, action, and nostalgia here. All of these guys have been there and done that, no doubt. Most of the lines give homage to movies from these actors' past. THe problem is that most of these lines aren't clever at all, and the actors literally threw in the towel as if this was some spoof, or like they didn't care. The whole film felt like some sort of joke, you know, like Universal Soldier 2.It's pretty bad. Can't we go to some roast in a year or two and see this.I'm supposed to know there's no plot. I DO! I DID! I was alright with knowing that going in. All that said, this is a really poor flick with some good action in the first 30 minutes.The writing is deplorable. The acting worse. And when I say no plot, I mean that in the absolute strongest sense of the phrase.We have one character here that we care one iota about, and he's killed in the first third of the film, in the film's best scene. From there on, this film sets all-time new low standards in nearly every department. No amount of carnage can make up for the rest of this film.The worst part is that I CAN like these types of films. Check out these similar action-packed ratings of mine to put this score into perspective: Safe 6/10 Lock Up 5.5/10 Battleship 6/10 The Raid 7.5/10 Act of Valor 5/10 IP Man 2 9/10 Fast Five 7/10 Die Hard 9/10 Rambo:First Blood Part 2 7/10 Set-Up 3/10 Blitz 5/10I hope that puts my 4/10 rating in perspective.You MIGHT like this(and I stress might) if you liked: Fast Five(better), Universal Soldier(better), Commando(better), A-Team(a little better), or Expendables(equally as disappointing).Hopefully this film falls way below that 7.0 mark after it gets some netflix/redbox play, because this current score is like leading the audience to the slaughterhouse. Sub-par, even for the genre.You want an example of an effective action packed flick with better performances, while being more entertaining in every way.. try 'Rundown 6.5/10'43/100",4,1,3,21 November 2012
Friday Night Lights," I disagree with the masses on this one and here's why
","First of All...I read this book back in HS and it may be the best sports book ever written. I'll go ahead and start with what I liked about the movie. The cinematography is excellent. THe football scenes are excellent. THe acting is above average. Now, I know what the scores are on IMDb for this(7.2) AND Varsity Blues(5.something).... and I also realize that FNL is a far better film when it comes to production value... but I have to say... I was more entertained and honestly enjoyed Varsity Blues more than I did FNL. Even though I hear it all the time,....this was one of the first times that I said, 'the book was much better'..... How can that be?...Liking VB better? By piling in as much of the books' subplots as possible.... by not focusing on specific characters(which resulted in underdevelopment)... FNL left me with an uneasy, unsatisfied feeling as a movie-goer. Is it dramatic....yes... is it more realistic than VB...YEs...and it should be considering its' based on true events... Unlike the book, I thought the film failed miserably in showing the true obsession that IS Permian football.....as well leaving the viewer COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED with the characters. As for the coaches in both VB and FNL.... Jon Voigt's acting was masterful compared to Thornton.... One is made better than the other and that's obvious.... but one is more enjoyable than the other....at least for this viewer. This is the 'babel' of sports movies... beautiful... great quality overall... but just left me with that blah feeling... In my opinion....7.2 is a 'quality' sympathy vote. Stays true to the book but comes off as a jumbled mess. 54/100",5,0,0,23 April 2008
Train to Busan," Without Question Belongs With the Best the Genre Has to Offer - mild spoiler
","It isn't perfect. Some of the CGI could be tightened-up just a bit. THere.That is the only criticism I can think of.'Train to Busan' is a superlative zombie film. Most films in this genre suffer from unrealistic and inconsistent moments. Well, it's a zombie movie so I guess calling it unrealistic is a bit moronic, but you know what I mean. The zombies acting inconsistently, or other stuff that just doesn't make sense. No character arcs, or many unfinished subplots and forgotten references also seem to be common weaknesses with these types of films. NOT HERE.This film does nearly everything flawlessly. It does follow a cookie-cutter template, but the Koreans follow that template and create a near perfect zombie film.The pacing is fantastic. The set-up is slow and methodical but effective, the build-up accelerates like a ZR1, and the stretch run has you glued oooey-blueey to the flat-screen. The characters are perfect, blending seamlessly and falling perfectly into the storyline of the film. The main roles are acted to perfection but I keep going back to the consistencies of this film that make it so great. Every moment when I anticipated an inconsistent action or scene - it failed to come. Instead, it handles every transition, every character, and every zombie tradition with painstaking care. The actions of the zombies and characters, and the timelines, set-structure and locations are laid out perfectly.Now, I'm sure there are many great films to come on my 2016 watchlist. I have 47 of 89 films still to watch, and many of the higher anticipated films are sitting in the un-watched portion. But, for now, 'Train to Busan' joins 'Hell or High Water', 'Deadpool', ROgue One', and 'Zootopia' as my favorite films of 2016 so far. It's right in the same class as '28 Days Later', 'Return of the Living Dead', 'Shaun of the Dead', and 'Pontypool' for me. Truly. An instant rewatch. A next day Blu-ray purchase(if avail today - hmmm). The film, despite some small CGI shortcomings, is better than most in that respect, and the overall look is still great. The film doesn't tackle some of the normal eradication subplots, and I think the movie is better for it. While the template might be basic, the execution and flow is anything but.This is one of the best Zombie movies ever made. I wouldn't be surprised if this 7.6 current rating climbs a nitch and settles around 7.7-7.8. It's a solid 8/10 for me, and may honestly be the best zombie movie I've ever seen. It certainly gives 'Night of the Living Dead', and a couple of others(ROTLD,SOTD, PONTY, 28, DOTD,RE-Anim) a run for their money.Flat-out AWESOME zombie-flick. If this is your bag - I would save the rental money and just buy it - you won't regret the decision or the savings.No need for a 'you'd like this if you liked' list... 84/100It's not scary... it's just really, really entertaining.. and makes recent American Zombie flicks look pretty awful if you ask me.",8,6,14,14 December 2016
The Maze Runner," 3rd day leftovers.
","It's edible, not terrible, and it might curb your hunger, but it's nothing to write home about.So I'll write to you guys/gals. 'Maze Runner' is exactly what you think it might be. Rehashed ideas, vague science-fiction, and little more than a catalyst for the following sequels. The good? THe production values are pretty good, and the acting better than average for this type of thing.While it brings nothing new to the table - the pacing of the film is quite nice, and the film does leave the door open to possibly answer many of the questions that go unanswered in the original here - and there are A LOT of questions.The biggest problem, the biggest question.. is the MAZE ITSELF!! Seriously, what's the purpose. It's weird because 'getting through the maze' highlights the best parts of this film, but in terms of explaining why it's there - we get nada. Why not just put a huge wall around them?Basically, the action and the acting are pretty good, but the story, the 'science-fiction' if you will, is vague/terrible. Of course I didn't read the books and maybe the books put more into the explanation(sure they did), but there's not enough here for me to really want to dive into this any further. I mean, these producers spent multi-millions for this two hours here with a movie called 'Maze Runner', and after 2 Hours I have no clue why there is even a maze, and I get the feeling that they don't either. I may actually give the sequels a try - in hopes that it really clears up a bunch of the reasoning behind the 'maze'. But, I'm not going to hold my breath.This is about even with the under-whelming, 'No Escape', and it's also about even with the first 'Hunger Games'. That's to say that overall this film is very average. A full-step below 'Catching Fire', and even a tad below my similarly rated 'Snowpiercer'.Average action flick. Lord of the Flies meets an extremely vague science-fiction plot, meets 'The Walking Dead'. THe monsters are called 'Grievers'. That's actually a good way to describe many of the movie-goers here. For a free redbox entry I don't feel slighted, but if I'd spent 3hrs and 30 bucks on this at the theater I wouldn't be too happy.54/100 I've seen a lot worse this year, but this is about the 35th best film out of 50 or so that I've seen from 2014.",5,2,3,30 January 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," went with another movie-buff and pretty big star wars fan. We were impressed.
","Where do I begin? (very mild spoilers - not at all really)It looks phenomenal. Gareth Edwards and Disney hit the look out of the ballpark. The minimized nostalgia, that was done with many subtle touches, not with overly sappy, nostalgic scenes like in Force Awakens. I liked Force Awakens. Gave it a 7. Here the nostalgia isn't spoon fed, it's little sidebars. Familiar faces in quick glances, and references that are tied to the first three films. They're all over, but they're not asking for attention.This film stands firmly on its own and you will b wondering why this wasn't episode 3. It's what episode 3 should have been. It's better than Jedi too. Yea, I said it. Go ahead and make it not useful, but that's my honest opinion. Love the new characters. Good performances across the board. Solid script. Funny, but it isn't overdone. I thought it was paced perfectly. Building tension as it went, and ending spectacularly. Mads, Mendelson, and Jones added some serious brass to this affair. I want to see this again. I'd have sat through it back to back if they'd have let me. Its exactly what they said it was.. a Star Wars story. A story that deserved to be told and in a way that blended it seamlessly with episode 4, and once and for all married the grit of 1976 with the cgi improvements of 2016. An elevated espionage factor helped move the story- line, and everything came together perfectly down the stretch.So much better than I ever could have imagined. This is the first time I've truly felt like this since 1987. Like we never even left that galaxy far, far away. Of all the Star Wars films made since Jedi, it's easily the most akin to the original trilogy, in look, feel and overall quality.80/100Three nit-pick negatives were an early scene when another conspirator was shot next to the Captain. Seemed strange and poorly thought-out, and then another scene were Felicity couldn't muster-up some tears which were desperately needed. The CGI face-rendering was much better than say Tron Legacies' Clu, but still isn't as good as it will be in decades to come. It wasn't too distracting. Everything else was aces.This still moves into first place for the time being - 43 of 89 films through the '16 watch-list. That's not a crazy fanboy ranking either... here's my scores for previous Star Wars Films for reference.Episode 4 New Hope - 10/10 Episode 5 Empire Strikes Back - 10/10 Episode 6 Return of the Jedi - 8.5/10 Episode 1 Phantom Menace - 5.5/10 Episode 2 Attack of the Clones 4.5/10 Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith 7/10 Episode 7 The Force Awakens 7.5/10It's the third sci-fi we've ck'd-out on IMAX. Force Awakens was decent, Arrival was just too slow and uneventful(sure it's thought provoking, but), but this is a good movie. A very good movie.",8,3,9,17 December 2016
The Hunger Games," Not terrible, but you could still do a whole lot better in this genre.
","I struggled between 5 and 6 here.I had a few problems with some of the effects, and the film just didn't have the huge epic look that I was expecting from such a blockbuster release. They really maximized the profit margin here. I swear they put half the average-to-meeger blockbuster budget in marketing. Hard to believe that Kurt Wimmer made a film that looked as good(or should I say as slightly fake) as Hunger Games with his nearly decade old release, Equilibrium. Only Kurt did it with a million bucks, and the movie was significantly better!That said, I'm a little disappointed in this one. It's not terrible. It's not good either.One of the films major flaws is the complete lack of chemistry between the leads. The way the two leads are written - you almost think they should hate each other. They do early on, but the 'growing' relationship part of this story makes no sense whatsoever. Just no chemistry at all here. Peeta Malark comes off as a cold, heartless coward, and that just really belittles Katnis Everdeen's character when she starts to 'Fall' for this nincapoop. I liked the fact that Katnis learned her media lessons throughout the film, but I was never sold on any attachment to Peeta. One minute Peeta is helping the others hunt Katnis down - the next minute they're kissing in a cave.This was an alright passing of the time. I didn't reach to turn it off. The pacing was OK. I won't watch this again even if it's down the road on cable.Significantly over-rated at it's current 7.4 here. Just thinking about a film like 'Frantic' from Roman Polanski being .6 lower at 6.8 kinda makes me queesy. This one made me feel like I did after watching 'The Running Man' for the first time back in the 80's. It's a little cheesy, and a bit disappointing.57/100 You MIGHT like this if you liked:The Running Man(slightly better or about even), Logan's Run(better than HG), Battle Royale(better than HG), No Escape(ever-so-slightly worse than HG), In Time(equally average)or Gymkata(much worse)",6,0,2,19 August 2012
Zootopia," Hilarious from start to finish.
","At this point I've only seen 7 or 8 films from 2016, so it's no surprise here that Zootopia moves into the #2 spot behind Deadpool.It should stay in the top 10 till next spring when I round-out the list by finishing about 100 films. It's solid.Kids should stay entertained with the animation and the animals, but most of the humor is really adult humor. For that reason, it may be just about the best Disney/pixar animated film for adults in terms of the humor. THere are no lulls in that aspect. You will laugh early and often. Credit the writers.The plot is a bit thin, but very few animated films have complex/truly-original plots.Worth owning. This redbox sat on the shelf for way too long, but after finding the time, I don't feel bad about dropping 13-15 bucks on it. Still, should have just bought it.recommended. 81/100 Personally, I enjoyed-it more than Frozen, or some other higher profile animated films over the last few years, but that's perhaps due to the lack of music and the increase of adult humor.",8,9,16,22 June 2016
The Babadook," it's about friggin' time!!! why do we have to shuffle through so much junk to find these?
","Moves in alongside Audition, Devil's Backbone, Drag Me To Hell, Behind the Mask, Let the Right One In, Scream, Sinister, Pontypool, and The Decent as one of my top ten favorite horror flicks of the last two decades(just ahead of Drag Me To Hell #10 and Sinister at #9). There's been some others of late come close like I Saw the Devil, Maniac, Citadel, and a few others, but this is the kind of horror film that comes around once every couple of years if you're lucky.When looking at the best over the last 5-10 years - the Aussies rule! I'm starting to watch more and more Aussie horror flicks lately because the ratio of good horror flicks versus bad one's from the Aussie's is strides better than what you'll find coming out of Hollywood 'Babadook' has everything you want from a horror film. It's genuinely frightening, visually dazzling, and thought-provoking. The lead, Essie Davis, is absolutely fantastic. She definitely drives this film with a truly amazing performance, and the young Noah Wiseman is also great.THe film doesn't rush, but it also doesn't drag. It builds to a Poltergeist like crescendo, and pins the viewer against their seat, clutching the armrest, and grinding their teeth.Highly recommend this one! 84/100... will likely hold onto a top 10-15 spot come years end(which will likely be out of about 100 films, or at least that's about what I average per year), and that's high, recently rare praise for ANY horror flick. Not bad for a film I hadn't even heard of. Shame on Hollywood for spoon-feeding us all that crap this past Halloween when stuff like this should have been all the rage at your local theater. And 6.9? Really? I imagine this score will slowly rise to the 7.5 range, and even that seems a tad low IMO. Hope it helps. See it whether or not you're a fan of the genre.",8,9,21,4 December 2014
Ted," right up my alley.... in the dumpster!
","I thought I'd note, so that you guys/gals don't think I'm some sort of religious fanatic, or someone who's easily offended - I'm neither.This movie is awful.The jokes aren't funny. I connected with some of the 80's nostalgia early in the film, and laughed at an early 'Saturday Night Fever' bit, but for the most part.... awful.One of the worst movies I've seen in a while.I gave 'Waiting' a 72/100,.. and 'Office Space' showed that one of these novice directors from TV fame could deliver a comedic masterpiece(gave that 95/100 - right there with Swingers and Anchorman as some of my favorite comedies of the last two decades).'ted' has little to no comedic value. There are two jokes in the film. One is over-regurgitated use of the f-bomb, and the other is any poke at religion. In either case the jokes aren't funny. It's almost as if Seth is making up for his censorship on television, and sorry Seth it comes of as 'you don't have anything better/funnier to say'.The film is quick to tell the audience about the heartfelt connection between it's lead and his Teddy bear, but their love for one another isn't developed at all. Their only connection seems to be the desire to smoke pot.... something else I don't have a problem with... or did at one time if you catch my drift... either way... those jokes aren't funny either.I spent the last two weeks stopping at nearly every rental machine in SE Tennessee to find this thing because it looked to be right up my alley. I guess you could say I did have high expectations, but anyone that thinks this film is anywhere close to it's current rating must also be high. Which is fine, but a lot of party animals think 'Half-baked' is a masterpiece too. Actually, 'half-baked - 52/100' might be considered a masterpiece next to this piece of junk.I like the Family Guy, but Seth McFarland has a real stinker here with 'Ted'. Seriously, an average, middle-of-the-road Adam Sandler piece is exponentially better.I could have been at the bottom of a 12 pack of brewsky, or at the end of a spliff, and it wouldn't have made one bit of difference - other than the fact that I might not have to remember just how bad this movie was.save your money, save your time.41/100If you want a good crude comedy go with 'Waiting', 'Clerks', or if you're looking for something out of the mainstream try the no-budget 'bindlestiffs' because this movie is terrible.",4,4,5,3 January 2013
The Secret in Their Eyes," very good, but demands some patience and concentration from it's audience
","'The Secret in Their Eyes' was one of a small number of films that I was willing to take a chance on buying without seeing. I bought this DVD for 2 dollars from my local video shop which is closing(a whole different story, and a shame). The DVD looked like it had never been viewed.I love foreign film. I think it's a real escape from the Hollywood trash that's coming out of late, and a truly great way to find some more obscure/under-viewed releases of the highest quality.This is not a film for kids. The themes and the pacing are geared towards an adult audience. Not only that, but the films subtitles move at a break-neck pace. I sure wish I spoke the language so that I might be able to enjoy more of the visual style of this film. Maybe I'll watch it again dubbed. That's something I don't usually prefer, but this film might actually open-up to some viewers like myself if you/I do so.The film really demands the audiences attention. It jumps back in forth in time, and the characters are rather candid and restrained. The story isn't all that confusing, but it's played out like backdrop, or something that's there, but not always the center of attention. I'm still not sure if I would classify this as more of a thriller, or a romance. It's rather uncomfortable to finally return to dialog-driven cinema. Let's face it - America has turned into a bunch of action-junkies.I have the feeling that I'll raise this rating after a second viewing. This is definitely the type of film that divulges new and fascinating secrets with repeat viewings. Some people will watch this and never want to watch it again(many won't even make it to the halfway point), and then some will watch it five times to 'take it all in'.This is a 'heavy' film.I wouldn't rent this(or buy it) unless you really have the time to sit down and concentrate on the film. The film is long and hard to follow for the first time viewer. If you take your attention away for one minute you'll feel lost in that weight. You probably won't have missed anything, but you'll want to rewind it and make sure.I kind of feel like this film beat the crap out of me. The last time I got that feeling was after P.T. Anderson's 'There Will Be Blood'. I think that is actually a really good comparison. Two totally different plots and time periods, but two crushingly powerful films.Careful with this one!",8,3,4,29 January 2012
Creed," Clearly the 2nd Best Rocky film.
","*mild spoilers only* Just got back from the 60th film I've viewed this year, 'Creed'. Edited-it into my top 25(#4) just before writing this review.It's hard to ignore the comparisons between 'Creed' and 'The Force AWakens'. Both the 7th film in historic film series. Both returning to their storyline roots, both with gigantic expectations, and both seemingly liked by the masses.I liked THe Force Awakens, but Creed is a superior film. It has the nostalgia without the nostalgia taking away from the individual story. The acting is superb, the boxing scenes amongst the best put to film(Southpaw-7.5 earlier this year also amongst the very best for this).I wouldn't say this is considerably better than Southpaw... it is better, and more importantly, it didn't feel the need to show me every aspect of the story in the trailer.GO see it on the big screen.THe new characters are far better developed than in TFA, and going back to ROcky Balboa, the series was starting to get an edge from the aging Stallone, who's acting chops were really starting to guide this series'Creed' takes that aspect to the next level. Stallone is fantastic. These are characters that we can root for.My only minor complaint is that the film is a little too chopped-up scene-wise in the first 45 minutes, and could have perhaps been served better by slowing down just a bit and dragging some scenes-out. I know it would have lengthened a film that is 2 hrs already, but I think this film would have been perfect at about 2:20, adding just a touch more to some early scenes.The theater was pretty packed, and the crowd seemed VERY pleased with the film. There were a few applause's at the end of the film. There was a louder/bigger applause for TFA, but that's because the 'world of star wars' had disappeared since 1987, and people were happy to have it back, and I saw it on opening night. Plus Star Wars fans are nuts, and even though Creed is a big hit, it will never receive the attention of a film like TFA. Regardless, Creed is CLEARLY the better of the two films, and a notch above the other fine boxing film from 2015, 'Southpaw'.Stallone is the driving force in this film, but Michael B. Jordan and many of the supporting performances are also strong here. There is a gritty realism to the film. It manages to use the nostalgia without feeling gimmicky. The references and recurrences from earlier ROcky films fit seamlessly into this new fresh story. THe acting and the direction are inspired. Stallone's personal care for this series has shown over the last two films - especially in the more serious scenes. I can't recommend this enough. An absolute shoe-in for the top 10, and possibly the top-5 of 2015. Pure, unadulterated entertainment.84/100 Nipping a 9/10 on the heels. SOmetimes I downgrade films after they soak-in for a while, but that won't be the case here...",8,5,9,27 December 2015
About Time," not bad, but terribly over-rated at the time @ 7.8?!?
","Good concept. The acting is fine. BUT, there are some issues.For one, both leads are miscast. The male lead here needs to be charming or funny, and while he seems like a fine actor, he's not that charming or that funny. I also don't understand why they felt like Rachel McAdams was a good casting choice. There's not enough background information about her character, and to put it mildly, there is absolutely NO chemistry between the two leads in the film.THe film reminded me of 'Mr. Nobody' - only it wasn't nearly as good.I like the point of the film - which is that it's actually better to appreciate the less-than-perfect moments of your life, have no regrets, but just takes so long to get to this. It's spoonfed to the audience in the last 5 minutes like the film did a bad job of expressing it, AND IT DID! I also didn't care for some of 'the rules of time travel' which seemed like they were written on the fly.I went in with high expectations, but that's not the only reason that this fell flat. 7.8? THis was no better than the slightly above-average 'Delivery Man' that I also watched last night.THe bottom-line is that I just didn't find anything interesting about these characters - other than the ever-so-obvious ability to travel in time. I'd probably skip it.63/100",6,10,20,31 March 2014
Don Jon," has everything, except....
","love the characters. all the actors do a fantastic job. the film has style. it really brings you in.the film has an important message, but it fails to complete the story. we get to know this guy, we root for him, we feel bad for him, maybe a tad disgusted by him, and then his life seemingly starts to change, but the movie ends abruptly, just when it had a head of steam it stops dead.this is 3/4 of a movie... with sooooo much potential in how it could have finished. Joseph is great, but how could he have watched his work, and where it ends, and been happy with it? I don't know.see it for the beautiful people, but if your one of those that hates abrupt endings that didn't finish any of the storyline - you'll hate this.it was all right there for the taking too.... could have easily been an 8 and a top 10 film for 2013, but this is the worst example of 'no ending whatsoever' that I've had to endure in quite some time.I have to give it up for the acting though - top notch across the board. Good idea. Great characters. Interesting storyline. Tough-subject matter handed rather deftly. BUT. No ending.57/100",6,0,1,31 January 2014
Zodiac," Sprawling Masterwork
","The first time I watched Zodiac I didn't really watch it. I wasn't in the mood for something that 'involved', and I probably made it a third of the way through-it and wound-up doing something else. Many years later I revisited the film.'Zodiac' is an amazing film. I don't know of many(if any) films that span such a large time-frame, and do it so effectively as it's done here. THe film just feels so real. THe violence is shocking AND shockingly well-done. It comes in short, quick, realistic doses. THere are also some genuinely scary scenes, and despite the films length, it's paced evenly and stays engrossing throughout. It's like 'All the President's Men(8/10)' met the original 'Maniac(6/10)', only it's significantly better than both.One of my favorite things about the film is the effective misleads, and Gylenhaal's relentless but smart, shy lead.I'm seriously considering rating this as the 4rth 10/10 from '07(There WIll Be Blood, King of Kong, U23D), and the 49th out of 4600+ ratings. It's at least worthy of a 9/10 and I find it a little mind-boggling that it's under 8 on this site. I would have expected about 8.2-8.4 here, but hey, like I said, the film will beat you up ala Sorcerer('77) or TWBB('07). It's not for everyone - except for film buffs and the older generation that doesn't have to have all that CGI and non-stop action to be entertained. Excellent film.",9,2,2,27 June 2017
Once," Wow. The movie is good...made almost great because of the spectacular music and believable characters
","From the opening title the music will absolutely blow you away. The live recordings add a sense of realism...as do the strong performances from an unsuspecting cast. I'm sure that many critics will question the piano store scene....sighting that one doesn't pick-up a song so quickly....of course, if you don't play music...you might think it's unrealistic...but if you're a musician...you can pick up a melody/chords/chordchanges at the drop of hat. The music is obviously in the forefront here.... in a nutshell... they've thrown out a strong album with this movie. Very strong! The love story is one of hope....where neither lead is where they want to be....but like the music...they perserveer... like the music...there is hope.. I love how the film leaves you with what should be a sad ending but yet the audience isn't sad....quite the opposite actually. Any film that leaves you thinking about where the characters will be in the future is, ultimately, a huge success. If for no other reason see this film for the incredible music tracks....but if your in the mood for a realistic feel-good movie... this also fits the bill. Highly Recommended. 86/100",7,2,4,19 January 2008
The Book Thief," all you need to know
","when you read or hear that the two biggest complaints are the scripts' use of the word 'soccer' ball instead of 'football', and the films declaration that 'the u.s.' occupy Germany instead of the 'allies' occupy Germany - YOU KNOW you're in for a good movie.For every person that realizes it would have been more accurate to use the word 'football'(which it would have), there is a person sitting there that wouldn't know that is a mistake. As a matter of fact that other person viewing would have said,'they just called a soccer ball a football', but more to the point,... WHO CARES??!!I suppose the third complaint if I kept reading further would be the fact that Germans are speaking English.Let me first re-iterate that most American viewers don't like subtitles - especially if the film stars people who speak the English language. Spielberg 'dumbed' it up for us in 'War Horse', it's been done hundreds of times.Anybody that can find 2 or three things to complain about this film is no rocket scientist(but finding more would be a serious issue), and then to do it without mentioning ANY of the MANY qualities of this film that are flat-out excellent is just an unjustice for anyone thinking about watching this film.The cinematography is aces, Geoffrey Rush delightful as usual, and John Williams' score is one of his best(now thats saying something that truly DOES matter).This is a great film. Rush to the redbox.83/100 Creeps into the back-end of 2013's top ten for me(out of 94 films as of this review).",7,1,3,24 April 2014
The Polar Express," there's no greater gift than friendship...
","I put this one off for a long time because of mixed reviews and happenstance.I just finished it on HD ON-Demand and I was very impressed.I had read some reviews and such that talked about 'a shallow story', 'poor animation', and other 'issues'.Great Christmas fare here! 'The Polar Express' is an immensely exciting entry into the genre. I watched the film in 2D/HD and it was a true visual spectacle. The action sequences and train shots stood out as some of the best visual animation I've seen to date.It's going to be hard for many purists to take what I'm about to say. It won't help the 'who found this helpful' percentage, but frankly I don't care - it's calling it how I see it.I watched Hugo a couple of weeks ago at the theater, and I truly believe that the Polar Express is as good or better. Where Hugo lacks in charm and adventure - The Polar Express excels. Where Hugo over-stays its' welcome - TPE tells a quick, basic fantasy storyline with no hidden agendas and no bows to anyone EXCEPT the audience.This film wasn't made for critics - it was tailor-made for someone like me - someone looking for a new Christmas classic to watch during the Holiday season. The first in a long-time, to line-up and put next to 'Miracle on 34th St.', 'A Christmas Story', 'Rudolph The Red-nose Reindeer', and others.The visual details during certain train sequences are jaw-dropping. Some people have talked about the 'eyes' of the characters. It's not perfect, but it is the most realistic attempt at a human face that I've seen in animation. For that reason, it is going to be criticized. You can compare it say to any Pixar film, and the pixar films(like all animated films save this one) still show the old-fashioned human animated face-shapes, that succumb to conventionality instead of innovation. The Polar Express may have bitten off more than it could chew in this aspect, but I don't think it took anything away from the movie. Besides, the rest of the film is as visually spectacular as ANYTHING FROM PIXAR or any other production company - that includes modern marvels like Tekkon Kinkreet, to timeless classics like Fantasia and Snow White. Visually, this animation doesn't take a back-seat to anything.So the story had to fall short, right? Maybe a little. It's a Christmas fantasy. The storyline isn't anymore complex than any other film in this genre. It's about the heart of Christmas, and all the joys of the holiday. Every Christmas storyline(save Christmas Story) falls short. I wasn't looking for a deep storyline when I hit play. I was looking for something that embodied the spirit of Christmas. I got that and more.Catch this if you've put it off like me.80/100 I never like to say to people that they didn't 'Get' a movie, or 'understand' a movie. People take offense. But, this film does have some neat little concepts and nuances that could be over-looked by some. THose that put those little pieces together, and feel the magic of those moments, will take more away from this film.You'll like this if you Liked: Toy Story 2, Hugo, and Monster House.",7,1,4,14 December 2011
The Town," Solid Entertainment. Some unbelievable and predictable moments, but still solid entertainment.
","The Town is about a group of friends from a Boston neighborhood that have evolved into a smash-n-bang robbery crew similar to what we saw in 'Point Break', only this crew is more polished both on the job as robbers, and actors.Ben Affleck gives another strong performance. That makes two really good performances in 'State of Play' and 'The Town'. What we're seeing before our very eyes is a pretty boy action star turning into a solid actor. The days of small roles, and funny one-liners to support his bigger, more accomplished co-stars, are OVER.It was far more action packed than I was expecting. 'The Town' is a fast-paced action/drama that is often predictable, and at times unbelievable, but the acting and some of the subplots add to this story and keep the viewer involved throughout.There were a few nice little tie-ins from early in the film that added to some of the action and dramatic moments. It's just another one of those 'realistic settings and characters involved in unrealistic actions with a little too much going on' type of movies. The kind that you enjoy watching once, but probably won't revisit until there's nothing else on TV that's any better. I think of Pride and Glory, Mystic River, We Own The Night, Dead Presidents, and movies of that guild. This selection has many of the same strengths AND weaknesses that you'll find in those films, but in the end, the clear stand out here is Affleck, and the chains that hold his character back. He breaks those chains, and it's kind of symbolic here as he's obviously breaking into the big-time as a serious, more than capable lead.I almost wish they had gone the 3 hour route with this one because some of the characters are under-developed as the film concentrates on the love story, and leaves those characters by the wayside. Spending more time in that area and in the ending may have brought this to the 8-9 level. Mild spoiler alert - when the first one of Ben's friends gets shot, or when Ben kicks his ex out of his apartment, we just simply don't care because we don't know enough about those characters. The one exception is Jeremy Renner - who is fantastic in a supporting role.Good movie, not great. Recommended for at least one viewing.73/100You'll like it if you like: Dead Presidents, State of Grace, Dark Blue, We Own the Night, and Serpico.",7,0,1,29 December 2010
Life of Pi," all the strengths, and even some of the weaknesses you'd expect from an innovative film..
","'Life of Pi' is one of the better films from 2012.I had heard it was a landmark film in terms of moving into the 'digital-age', and the visuals definitely set this film apart, but I have to admit that the movie had a better storyline and under-lying meaning than I was expecting.The visuals were only one facet of this fine film, and on occasion, the films only weakness. The digital make-up of this visual wonder allowed the actors, animals, and the vast ocean to share the same space - while never sharing the same space. The films use of generated 'space' is unrivaled. It's a backwards movie in terms of production. The plus-side is no formatting issues. The film blends many computer-generated visuals along with the digitally captured live-action.It's a landmark in film-making much like Tron, Last Starfighter, Blade Runner, A Scanner Darkly, and Roger Rabbit, in that it uses a new technique that opens up all sorts of doors for the future. BUT, if you look back at the films I just mentioned they all have weaknesses(well maybe not so much Blade Runner). Like a new model car - they might have few recalls down the road.Ang Lee did a good job here meshing all this together, but he also took some liberties with all this technology - occasionally taking it a bit too far. That's about my only gripe. After all, most of the film is told in flashback style which gives you the ability to embellish without necessarily being untruthful, but there are a couple of moments that might have been better-off if they were toned-down just a bit.The acting is superb.Some of the scenes involving the animals are hard to watch, but I think the film actually took great care of that aspect of the film.I can highly recommend this as something that is much more than a man on a boat.You MIGHT like this if you liked: Tree of Life(not as good and slower), Slumdog Millionaire(better and stars one of the same actors), Titanic(about equal in every way, but Life of Pi is only 2hrs not 3).79/100 Should have no problem holding a top-ten spot for 2012. Right now, I'd have it around 7 or 8, having seen about 80 of the 85 films on my 2012 watchlist.",7,1,3,10 April 2013
Southpaw," great film turned merely good by the trailer
","The very first time I saw the trailer - I was not happy. I mean just go ahead and show us the entire film. CHampion boxer gets offended by up-n-coming challenger, the Champion's wife dies in the melee, he loses it, in turn loses custody of his kid, gets his act together, wins back his title and his daughter. NOW, I shouldn't have even had to check the 'contains spoilers' box for this review, because the trailer let me know all of that before I watched the film.It's a shame too. I think the impact of Rachel McAdams death would have been a lot greater had the trailer concealed the fact. The scene is great! Fantastically acted and powerful - only we saw it coming!Hopefully Fuqua will realize the gravity of this mistake. WIthout the trailer, I think this film would have gained more steam at the box office and on rental, but people put it off because, heck, we know what's gonna happen.Jake Gylenhaal is great. THe direction is sharp. The boxing scenes among the best and most realistic that Hollywood has ever had to offer. The film manages to pull itself out of all the depression without seeming too cliché' or happy-go-lucky, and yet all of these successes, all of the fantastic film-making, and it's overall impact, is lessened because of poorly thought-out, nearly criminal trailer.75/100. Probably would say 82/100 had I not seen it all coming.",8,1,2,2 November 2015
21 Jump Street," yeah, I was just like you
","I too expected this to stink. Another buddy cop movie, starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, based on a lousy 80's television show - doesn't sound all that appealing.Hill's 'The Sitter', completely mediocre, and it's been quite a while since Superbads success. Channing Tatum showed his comedic timing during his appearance on SNL. I was still hesitant.But, I stand corrected.This is the funniest movie since last years' Bridesmaids.The key here is the fantastic script. The story isn't rocket-science, and we knew it wouldn't be, but the comedic timing of the leads is spot-on, and they were given a great script to work with.I found myself laughing multiple times throughout. My spouse concurred. One late, unnecessary gross-out moment brought it down a notch. The film hadn't used any of those gimmicks and didn't need to in the end. It just seemed a bit out of place and distasteful.The leads did a great job here. Their characters worked exactly how they should in a buddy-cop flick like this. They bounced off each other for an hour and a half, and the result will surely be one of the best comedies of the year, and an outside shot for my 2012 top-25(back-end)if it can hold-on.Watch out for a sneaky cameo(spoiled by the cast list if you look).Nice surprise.Deserves it's ranking here.Stuck between 7-8, but going with 76/100, so I'm rounding to 8.You'll enjoy this if you liked:The Other Guys, Starsky and Hutch, If Looks Could Kill, or Blue Streak - even though I think this is actually a clear notch above all of those films.",7,70,131,22 March 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Got a little Captain in You? SEE THIS MOVIE!
","I started writing this review four or five times. I was comparing this movie to The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, and Spiderman. In the end, I realized that one of the few things that Captain America has in common with those movies - is that Captain America is a very good comic based feature film.It doesn't have the 'look' of the Dark Knight, or the powerhouse performance of Heath Ledger(although Hugo is good), but Captain America has a truckload-full of comic heritage/homage(and style). The action is furious, and the hand-on-hand combat scenes are jaw-droppingly well-done.The story is totally unbelievable, totally ridiculous, and yet so totally comic-book; exactly what it was supposed to be. But, what really sets this movie apart is the quality and care that went into the feature from top to bottom.The film isn't as predictable or simplistic as many others in the genre.Marvel has really polished this 40's hero into something that will appeal to anyone who is going into the theater/movie to be entertained. The film has everything to offer: Action, Comedy, thoughtful computer imaging, well-developed characters, a deep storyline, and complete and total awareness of what a comic-book audience might want out of a movie.If you don't want to see a story that centers around a dangerous, independent faction of the Gustapo garnering power from unearthly sources, only for the U.S. to harness the same power to create the American fighting machine, only to get revenge, in what still amounts to an American WW2 propaganda campaign enactment - then don't see this movie. That war is over anyway. And if all that nonsense isn't enough for you - then don't worry - there's a lot more, fun 'nonsense' that I left out.BUT, if you just wanna sit down and put a huge smile on your face for the fastest two hours of this movie-season, then jump aboard this new franchise while it's fresh and hot.In recent decades we have had many Batman films, many Spiderman films, many Superman films, many hulk films, and 2 Ironman films. When I heard about the development of this project - I was giddy. Months later when the film was released, and after I saw the average trailers, I missed the film at theaters. Thankfully, the wait for the DVD release wouldn't be long.I went in with moderate expectations. I was aware that the score hovered around 7.0 here on IMDb.Like many other kids, I grew up liking Captain America. The normal guy dressed in red, white, and blue, yielding a shield that resembled the American flag, riding motorcycles... what's not to like. He was always the coolest of the Marvel characters, and it's fitting that we get to enjoy such a cool and thorough adaptation.This movie brought all those likable character traits to life and made me proud to be a fan. The retro look added realism to an unrealistic story. This film looks like it might have been made in the 80's, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.The films subject matter and storyline demands open-mindedness from its audience, but isn't that exactly what we should expect from a comic book film? If you can't put aside those expectations of realism - then you shouldn't see a comic book based film in the first place. Spend your hard earned money on this if you haven't yet, and get blown away from this years best pure-action film.Great little surprise! 84/100 You'll like this if you liked:Batman('89), Ironman, Superman('78), Superman 2('80),Rocketeer, and The Punisher('04).Somehow, with all it's action and storytelling, Captain America also successfully and seamlessly serves as the major platform for the upcoming Avengers project.P.S. I liked Thor, but I LOVED this.Thanks for reading, and I sincerely hope you enjoy the movie.",8,7,13,25 October 2011
Oblivion," so close.
","'Oblivion' borrows quite a bit from films like 'Moon', 'Prometheus', and 'Matrix', and NO DOUBT, it is a skillfully crafted sci-fi film.The films twists are anything but surprising, but they work in the context of the story, and add a bit of flavor to the ending.The film could have really been great if it had allowed Morgan Freeman's character to expand a bit on the plot/history.I went into this with fairly high expectations. At the mid-way point, I thought this was headed towards a 5-6 rating, but the last 30 minutes is probably the strongest part of the film.mild spoiler alert. One of the problems with the film is that the opening narration is completely under-minded by what follows. The film might have been better without it.more mild spoilers. Cruise and the rest of the cast does an admirable job, but the script doesn't really tackle the inner-struggles of the lead character like it should. That's where a film like 'Moon' surpasses 'Oblivion'. Just because 'your memory has been wiped'(even though we find that's not really the case), it doesn't mean that the strength of the human-spirit should be so dulled as it is here. The film hit on some of these subjects with the Lake retreat and other aspects(the books etc), but in terms of character development and drama it wanes. Even 'Equilibrium' didn't gloss over these themes as much as they do here. If the filmmakers had changed that aspect of this film - it would have been one of the years best.I can recommend this, but it's still a bit frustrating how the story is seemingly complete, but the struggles of the characters are not well represented.67/100You might like this if you liked: The Host(not as good as this), Moon(better than this), Matrix(better than this), or Avatar(about even).",7,4,7,4 September 2013
Man of Steel," the purists don't like it, the rest of us do.
","I've read most of the negative reviews, and the majority of those talk about inconsistencies with the comic or the original storyline. They talk about Henry Cavill not being as charming as Christopher Reeve. The talk about what THEY wanted out of the film.I'll tell what I wanted... in this day and age of, not just remaking, but copying every successful film from our past and doing it shamelessly,.. I wanted something fresh and new. Something where I didn't know everything that was coming. To be perfectly honest: some of the changes are vast improvements, and I'm not just talking about how it 'looks' either. Mild Spoiler alert: Like the old(and ridiculous) idea that Lois Lane can't place Clark Kent's face to Superman. And that's not the only improvement to the traditional logic.This film is a visual wonder - the kind you would expect from a director who's breakout film was '300'. It takes full advantage of today's technology to bring the power and the wonder of Superman to life.Cavill is the perfect casting choice. Physically, he is the most imposing Superman to hit the screen, and while he isn't asked to do much acting with a script that is sparse in relation to the action, he does a fine job. He actually sounds A LOT like Reeves, but comparing his acting skills to one of the most under-rated and classically trained actors to ever play a super-hero is a bit unfair.I highly recommend this. It's perhaps a bit TOO action-packed. Zach could have put in a bit more dialog to even things out a bit. Some of the final action scenes got a little too 'Transformers' for me(well, maybe not that bad). That's about my only complaint.The film serves more as the 'complete set-up' to the Superman we know instead of rushing to that point. I don't know that I can call this 'better' than Superman 1 and 2 from the 80's, but it's certainly close to that level even though it's a completely different type of film. I don't think it's quite as good though.BUT, the 'look' and the sound of the film are absolutely amazing.Immediately moves into my top 25 for 2013.64/100",6,3,6,11 December 2013
The Color of Money," I recently up'd this from 8 to 9, and here's a few reasons why...
","I was flipping through the HD movie channels on the guide the other day and saw that 'The Color of Money' was about to start. It's a movie I have probably seen 10 times or more, but I hadn't seen it in about a decade.It didn't take long for me to remember all the reasons I love(d) this movie.The first thing that stood out immediately were the opening credits and the opening scene. Robbie Robertson's music is hypnotizing. It fits the dreary bar and poolhall's like musty smoke and old hardwood. It's not just his music either - ALL the music in this movie is fantastic and strategically placed.Fast Eddie Felson(Newman) notices Vince right away, 'that kids got a sledge-hammer break'.Paul Newman is FANTASTIC in this movie. The writing, the music, the acting - all superb.Those who never saw 'the Hustler' can appreciate this film on it's own, but some of the subtleties and references to Fast Eddie Felson carry a little more weight(as does the ending) if you have. We don't need an explanation of what happened to Fast Eddie Felson from 1961 to 1985(we get the idea), but I think the entire meaning of this film is lost if the viewer doesn't understand the arc of Paul Newman's character from the ending of 'the Hustler' to the ending of 'the Color of Money'. I think the single biggest reason that this film is scored where it is - is that the ending of this film is rather abrupt and anti-climactic. For that matter, so was the ending from 'The Hustler', but 'the Hustler' doesn't appear to suffer from it on IMDb. Another reason may be because of Tom Cruise. Cruise is amazing here, but Cruise has become the 'Dallas Cowboy' of acting. The actor we love to hate. A lot of people snarl or misjudge a film solely because it stars Tom Cruise. The character of Vince is just as easy to dislike.Just the fact that MI4:Ghost Protocol is scored higher on this website makes me cringe.I don't think there was a better person for the role. One of my favorite lines of the film is when Eddie says, 'Don't change the shirt - it's a nice touch'.... or earlier when he says, 'you've got the flake, you've got that down pat, but can you flake on and flake off, I don't know'. The dialog here is superbly written and each actor is perfectly cast.Eddie sees Vince as an opportunity. An opportunity to make money? Yes, but more like an opportunity to pick up where he(Eddie) left off so many years ago, when he was 'put out of the business' so-to-speak.I just want this movie to keep going.Each character is well-developed. John Turturro is great, and there are other strong supporting roles from a few lesser-known but no less talented actors like Helen Shaver and Bill Cobbs.The shots in and around the poolhalls reek of realism, and all the betting and play is choreographed expertly.While the ending is abrupt - it contains a nice little twist that is extremely effective and really dials into the meaning of this film.Is this better than 'The Hustler'? No. Is it better than the 6.8 ranking here? Heck yea it is! I think that some people forget that this really is a sequel. How many films do this? Create a sequel 25 years later? An effective one at that? Anyone that has seen 'the Hustler' and 'the Color of Money' leaves this film with a really good idea of what happened to Fast Eddie over the last 25 years, and the next 25 to come.Bill Cobbs(Orvis) says, 'Do you know who you have stake-horsing here for you - this here's Fast Eddie Felson'. You almost have to see 'the Hustler' to have a true appreciation and under-standing of 'The Color of Money'.UNDERRATED!87/100There's also a few shots in here that are absolutely mesmerzing - the kind you have to wonder how in the heck Martin pulled them off.",9,0,0,18 April 2012
Hugo," Good not great

It did have some of the best use of 3D technology to date, but I still wish I had gone to see the 2D version. 3D is kind of cool, but I think it takes away from the clarity of the picture. This may be the last time I spend my money on a 3D picture, and it has nothing to do with Scorcese's first attempt with this technology - he did a great job.This movie is not a comedy. It's quite important to know that going in. It is a drama about an orphan/genius/clockmaker.The film is, for the most part, light-hearted and feel-good throughout, but the film really doesn't have a great story to tell. Scorcese goes in many different directions here, and tries to mold them together in what becomes an anti-climactic finish.I think the film would have benefited from more dialog for its' lead character.Small spoilers coming. The whole movie-theme here was interesting, but like the rest of the film it thrives only visually and doesn't seem to have much substance. Hearing Ben Kingsley talk about why his films waned in popularity seemed like a bunch of jabberwocky. The whole theme resonated like another nod to Hollywood that really boosts ratings for some reason, but never really tugs the heart-strings. It's a given that any film 'about film or making film' is going to be over-rated in these circles. Why? I have no idea.(Hollywood likes itself - see Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Get SHorty, The Player, Adaptation, Ed Wood, etc - make a Hollywood movie and the critics will Loooooove you) Granted, some of those films are very good, but they still tend to be over-rated.That also means this is going to be getting some Oscar nominations. It could be in the race for cinematography and some other 'visual' categories, but this is no best picture by any means.We needed this film to have as much focus on the dialog and story as it did the visuals and the film-theme. It was obvious to me that the director was bowing to film-makers and Ben Kingsley, and not really worrying too much about the rest of us.The film needed some more comedy and action. And even though it's a drama - it needed more drama too.The film is beautiful to look at, and in that aspect it might very well be the best movie of the year. The problem here is that there are virtually no stand out scenes. I've read some reviews that talked about other peoples' reactions to the film. While I didn't interview anybody else in the theater - everyone in the theater did not react to the film for the duration, and they were half way out of their seats 5 seconds before the credits rolled.A great example of visual genius with a huge dose of existentialism from the director. In the end, it's just another over-rated film about making film that the average person can't relate to, and the other story-lines fall kind of flat.The whole time I was thinking, 'what he's doing with camera is amazing, but what he's doing with the story is dull'.I know this review was harsh. This is a good movie, but it deserves more like 7.5. If you want a better example of this type of story/style - then revisit 'The Black Stallion'. It has more interesting characters, more action, and more that the common person can relate to than this film does - and it's no less of a visual masterpiece. I find it weird that 'The Black Stallion' can employ a kid that never acted in his life before the production, and yet that performance has more substance than the lead characters in the last two blockbusters I watched(Hugo and Super 8).Why 'The Black Stallion' is rated 7.1 and this is rated 8.6 is beyond me. I know which one I'd rather re-watch.Worth a look, but do not expect action or comedy.You might like this if you liked:The Black Stallion(better), The Polar Express(not as good), Cinema Paradiso(much better) Great Expectations(hawke version, better), or City of Ember(worse).Right now it's sitting at 7 on my top 10 of 2011 list, but it might have trouble holding on with Meloncholia, 50/50, Midnight in Paris, and Drive still in the watch-list.",7,7,12,28 November 2011
Disturbia," worth your 7 bucks
","This is a solid thriller in the 'Rear Window' guild. While not as great a film, Disturbia, does provide consistent intrigue and thrills. Shia does a fine job...it is obvious why he's a rising star in Hollywood. There is a nice twist(the twinkie photo)....and the film uses its' settings to its' advantage......the film keeps the viewer interested by keeping it basic.....there is never a point where the audience gets impatient or uneasy....never a boring lapse. A monumental achievement considering the entire film is shot in four or five locations. The last thirty minutes is intense. Not fancy by any means....just solid.... THe plus's:Shia,pacing,supporting roles(except maybe the girls part 'which was poorly written'), thrills/scares, not overlong. Neg's:not many...script could have been a little tighter, relationship seemed unrealistic/not genuine...lack of developed subplots? Overall, this is a solid, thrilling night at the movies!",7,0,2,18 May 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man," above average. better than the last Spidey. good and bad.
","mild spoiler - I'll give you a warning...The good.This takes us back to the TV show a little bit. A lot of the 'Spidey' scenes are shown with a lot of grit/realism and windows, and that's a good thing. Early on, this flick is super cool.Emma Stone is a hotty even if her lines are pretty bad.The first half of the film is funnier than any of the Spidey entries, and the set-up/character development of Spidey himself is pretty strong.The Bad. The second half of the films story seems rushed and thrown together in haste. Emma Stone's character was so poorly ignored that it really hurt the film. The most likable character(spoiler alert stop reading this paragraph), played by Dennis Leary, is killed. It leaves a bad aftertaste and hints to sequel sub-plots that we already don't care about.This just came out too soon and contains too many of the similarities to the original spidey comic book storyline development for us to really care. The film actually excels and surpasses the same set-ups from the last trilogy, but the second half reminds me more of the last hour of SPiderman 3 when 'The Amazing Spiderman' let's the geek squad run and ruin the grittyness and likability of the first half of this film. The writing isn't the best, nor is the pacing. It loses all comedy and drama in the second half, and starts using far more of the CGI spidey than the real spidey, which is the intrigue of this films first half. Shame too!As good as I expected, but no better or worse. 63/100You'd Like This If You LIked: Hulk(ed norton vers/about even), Spiderman 3(not as good as TAS), or Green Lantern(about even or ever so slightly below this)).",6,0,1,12 November 2012
Goon," strange balance going on here.
","Seann William Scott absolutely makes this movie. He plays the dumb, sweet-yet-tough Doug Glatt to perfection. Amongst all the f-bombs(250+), debauchery, violence, and comedy, lies a heart.Now this is a character that we can root for. A man capable of knocking your block-off, but with absolutely no emotional connection with the victim whatsoever. He means well when he knocks you out. He has no perception of reality, but his brutal honesty and his unusual talent make him the perfect hero.I visited my mother a few weeks ago, and decided to watch this again(thanks Netflix/mom). A few minutes-in my conservative 65 yr-old mother joined me. At first I was cringing because I knew the film couldn't get one sentence out without dropping an expletive, but I stood my ground because I knew the film had it's heart in the right place. Sure enough, she loved it. I think that speaks volumes. It shows the versatility of the film. It's perhaps the best 'MAN'-flick of the last 5 years, yet an older-conservative woman can appreciate the film for it's more serious subplots, and big heart.HIGHLY recommended. Granted, there aren't many films to line-up against it, but 'Goon' is my favorite hockey film. Yes, I love slap shot, but I love 'Goon' even more.",8,1,2,10 April 2014
No Strings Attached," Actually, there are a few strings attached.
","Ivan Reitman's new romantic comedy 'No Strings Attached' is far from terrible, but it still does not compare with the director's early films.Natalie Portman, the recent Best Actress award winner, is not asked to do too much here. At least she can hold some of the emotional scenes - UNLIKE her counterpart.Ashton Kutcher's one-trick-pony acting style leaves this relationship in love purgatory. He couldn't shed an honest tear if his acting life depended on it. The viewer is just left with this feeling that his character has no feeling... for her... or for the audience. We needed his character to show some of the emotion that Portman had little trouble with. Ashton's only job here is to smile and run around half naked for a third of the movie.Some of the supporting roles were nice additions both for their performances and their place in the story/script.This was obviously a big budget production with a veteran director, but unfortunately Kutchers emotionless performance robs this romantic-comedy of the romance. That characteristic alone is enough of a serious flaw to drastically drop my score here. If there was just one moment, ONE, where we actually felt like Kutcher genuinely felt bad because Portman wasn't around - this score would be significantly higher.54/100",4,1,3,30 May 2011
Quantum of Solace," Good fun, but getting further and further away from what made Bond, Bond.
","I must say that I was encouraged by the opening. An action sequence followed by a good title song sung by Alisha keys and JAck White got us off and running.Two decisions made this an average Bond film, at best. The first decision was to ride on Casino Royale's coat-tails. Continuing where Royale left off.... seems contrived and hurried. They should of left it all behind and started anew. The only weak aspect of 'Royale' was the finale' with the building, and we pick up right were we left off here.The second issue is a clear lack of gadgets. They started to disappear in 'Royale', and they were extinct here. I know we lost the legendary Desmond Llewelyn, but did we have to lose the gadgets too? Or bring back John Cleese. I thought he was perfect for the role. It makes a little sense to have it scaled down in 'Royale' because Bond was just becoming a double-O, but he's full-fledged here and should have all the royal toys at his disposal.Quantum of Solace is nothing more than an above average action flick that has forgotten its' roots and, in so, it has forgotten its' audience and sacrificed a long standing reputation.Finally, at the end of the film, the plot comes together in a big ol'jumbled mess. The final scene saves some browny points for it's furious finish but, in the end, this probably falls somewhere between The Living Daylights and Die Another Day on the Bond Totem pole.Olga's a hotty, Craig is STILL bond... hopefully they'll see how the apple fell WAY to far from the tree on bond tradition and give us more Shaken Martini's, Gadgets, a new Q, and more substantial dialogue in the future.Not to discourage anyone(fans and nonfans alike) from seeing it because it's NOT TERRIBLE - it's just not nearly as good as I'd hoped.The clarity of the shots is amazing, but the editing and acting are a bit suspect, as is the storyline. The opening action sequence is a bit of a mess.54/100 **1/2(outta5)I understand Bond must 'evolve', and I like the new realistic approach to things, but do we really have to sacrifice the gadgets and one liners to accomplish that?",5,2,5,13 November 2008
District 9," Hands Down the Best Film of 2009
","I considered many others. The Hurt Locker. Up. Fantastic Mr. Fox. Etc.District 9 is an unbelievable achievement. Visually, it is mind-blowing. Blade Runner, Dark Knight, 2001, and Clockwork Orange type mind-blowing. 'The 9' takes a social commentary and spins it into one of the most original and thrilling science fiction adventures of our time.Neil Blokamp jumps forward in movie-making-plausibility and creates something fresh, something new, something cinema needed, and something that shouldn't have been able to be pulled off - and he does it without missing the mark even once.Sharlto Copley breaks through in his big-screen debut as an MNU(Multi-National-United) representative sent to inform the aliens of their re-location. The humans seem to have a limited knowledge of their visiting friends - even though their ship has hovered above Johannesburg for nearly 20 years. Every human act is calculated, spun to their advantage, and the aliens are misunderstood,.. mistreated.Copley's character, Mr. Van De Merwe, will be forced to re-think his position. He will find out more in a matter of days than the rest of us have in years. He will attempt to save himself and an alien species, and he will come under attack from his own kind.Each scene is fantastic. As the movie goes from scene to scene the plot dives deeper and deeper, until, just like every good sci-fi film, it would take many years to come to it's actual conclusion. Like 2001, and Logan's Run, District 9 needs another 2 hours and 100 million to finish the story - but its almost better that it doesn't. The future, unknown. The story, incomplete. The moment, breathtaking. The message, the importance of understanding and compassion. District 9 is hands down the best film of 2009 - nothing(that I've seen) comes close.94/100Very, and I mean very close to becoming my 12th '10'.Careful with some DVD format issues they had with this one - if you can't see the Alien subtitles - DON'T WaTCH IT! Without them it's more like 80/100",9,3,6,29 December 2009
Twilight," not a lover and not a hater... my thoughts below
","First of all - I was stuck between 6 and 7 here but I liked the film better than its' present 6.1 rating so I'm going with 7. We'll start with the good.... The Cinematography is first rate. Not only does the film succeed with it's locales and it's stunning scenery but there is a sense of style and originality in the filming. Haze. Clarity versus Blur. The dark Blue tone of everything. It's as if a Blue Moon is cast over the entire film only much of the film is shot in daylight.That's another thing that I really liked about this one. Twilight is a departure from some of the usual Vampire fare in that it bends the rules of vampirism just enough to make it interesting but not enough to completely separate it from the genre as a whole. I think the love story has substance and the fact that it's optimistic is yet another twist on the usual vampire fare. The leads do a spectacular job of selling the love story and treading the water between human and daywalker. I loved the fact that the movie stayed true to other vampire films in it's portrayal of the thirst for blood but still allowed the lead male to put love before hunger.All in all the cast did a fine job... not spectacular... but fine.the bad.... and there really isn't much here to speak of... we could have used a little more 'horror'. I think that was the product of the films' pg13 rating... but it certainly seems as if they could have piled a little more scary moments into the film. the story is a bit shallow and the ending leaves the door a little too wide open... not finishing the story and basically stamping the fact that there is an inevitable sequel.I would have liked to have heard some crazy music... I loved the 'Muse' they threw in there but would've also liked to have heard some NIN or something else with a little kick.This is a good movie. Not Great. But Good. If a substantial storyline and plot is your bag then you might want to opt out. If you appreciate cinematography and enjoy the vampire genre on the whole - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.Maybe not worthy of the hype but certainly a decent effort. Worth a second view and I will catch the sequel.67/100 or 3.5/5You'll like it if you liked: Near Dark, Ginger Snaps, The Bride, The Faculty, and Interview With a Vampire.",7,1,4,29 May 2009
It Follows," fresh idea ruined by monotonous panning
","I like the premise of the film, and the start the film seems to have a care for cinematography and overall style. It has some great sound editing to boot.BUT... after 20 minutes I started to ask myself, 'is every shot going to be a slow pan?', and the answer was unfortunately, YES.We're talking a ridiculous amount. It can't lead into or exit a scene without it. they should have called the film, It Zooms.The film gets a lot right though. It looks great(other than the monotonous panning), and the story-line is definitely interesting and fresh. As I said the sound editing and the creepy music are just fantastic.In the end though, I think the writers and directors had some real problems with how to end the film. Fares average on the scare-meter, but I think the 'style' it gets sooo much credit for is a bit overdone at times. The movie ended and my eyes were slow-panning for a week.",6,2,4,30 May 2016
Gone Girl," good performances abound, and love the social/media commentary
","Granted, I'm behind on finishing-up my 2014 watch-list, and I still have 'Interstellar', 'Birdman', 'American Sniper', 'Whiplash'(late edit new#1) and 'Nighcrawler' on my watchlist, so there is still a lot of sorting- out to do in terms of my 2014 top 25 list. BUT, for now, 'Gone Girl' is at the top.That's out of about 50 viewed films from last year.'Gone Girl' is an absolute immersion into a great murder mystery. The plot seems to be ever-evolving, and the whole thing is bolstered by some fantastic performances from a great cast. The six largest roles(Affleck, Pike, Harris, Perry, Coon, and Dickens) are deftly handled. Tyler Perry is probably the best surprise here, but everyone is good.The film has pitch-perfect pacing. It doesn't wait too long to get into the main plot, and most of the character-development is done via flashbacks, and just enough is used to both give us some background, but not tell us too much about the 'character' of these characters. Most of that comes late in the film, and that's good because it helps the audience reserve judgement.Trent Reznor's music is toned way down from say 'Social Network', but I think that's appropriate for a film where the plot is the main course.The entire movie is 'less fancy' than FIncher's previous work, but it's right up there with everything else. On my ratings I have it a smidge below 'The Game'(#2 of 1997), about even with 'Social Network'(#2 film for 2010), 'Seven'(#2 of 1995) and 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' (#2 film for 2011),.. it's a touch better than 'Zodiac'(my #5 film of 2007) and 'Fight Club'(#9 for 1999)... it's a lot better than 'Curious Case' and 'Panic Room', neither of which made my top 25.This film throws out some pretty big twists in the last half-hour. It couldn't have ended any other way, but the ending is certainly one aspect that might detach this film from it's audience as we really want to see what happens next - but isn't that a trademark of many great films?I highly recommend this. I went-in with some pretty high expectations and it did NOT disappoint.The three others I watched it with concurred..very...good...movie. Albeit less re-watchable than some of his other works - if for no other reason than the genre. I'd still like to watch it again though.88/100It could have used just a touch more scoring, and perhaps a bit more of Fugit and Dickens' cop scenes to further explore that side of things, but overall, it's very good, and it will certainly hold onto a top 5 spot for 2014. Can it hold onto the top spot? Dunno, we'll see.",8,2,6,13 February 2015
Django Unchained," so far, it's the best 2012 film that i've seen(late edit:now #2)
","Don't know if it will hold that spot. This is the first 9/10 of last year's films crop for me. Granted, I've only seen about 50 of the 90 or so films that I intended to view.'Django' is exactly what I expected. I expected violence. Got it. I expected controversial, witty subject matter, and I got that too. I had high expectations, after all, this is one of the years most hyped films, from one of Hollywood's standout director's. Knew all that going in, and now I'm left here debating if this thing deserves a ten. I didn't debate for long, and settled with 9.One of the director's best. Right there with Reservoir Dogs for me. A totally different film, but still a nine. Waltz deserves an Oscar, and so does Tarantino. Beautiful, violent film. 90/100 It was much better than Cats.. I'd see it again, again, and again. Perfectly paced for the length.. feels more liked 2:15. Awesome music. Awesome dialog. Fantastic characters. Offensive. Gory. No excuse film-making at it's very best. Made even better because of those who will despise it. Not as violent as bill, and now makes me wonder if a re-watch will yield a ten upgrade. This film was a blast.LATE EDIt.. Has since been unseated as my best film for 2012, but I anticipate this will stay in the top 3.. #2 rt now with about 30 films left on my 2012 watch list.",9,2,8,18 January 2013
Drive," A stylish, deliberate film that will divide audiences.
","Drive is the best film of 2011. I'd probably put it a touch above two polar-opposite types of films;The Descendants and Midnight in Paris(both great).Nicolas Winding Refn has an eye and an ear for direction. This is easily the most stylish film since Michael Mann's Early Work, or William Friedkin's 'To Live and Die in L.A.'. This is a 'throwback' film. It's deliberate pacing and basic story-line will likely turn- off those in search of a new 'Fast and Furious' entry, but for those in search of a film that was 'cared for', a film that oozes perfection with nearly every frame, THIS IS IT!The cinematography is awesome. Angles, lighting and colors that would make Kubrick proud.And the music... my god the music... I'd pay 30 bucks to go see this at the local IMAX tonight if it were there.The story is a rather basic, fairly-good-guy mixing with fairly-bad- people storyline. This is a lead character that we can root for, but the script is so bare that we hardly know him. That's part of the intrigue here. He's the 'man with no name'.. the driver.. that's it. THis is Michael Mann's 'Thief' all over again, only better(omg did I just say that, OK fine Thief's equal then). It's a hard-edged, stylish juggernaut of a film.It's not perfect. There are some issues with the opening scene(as great as it is), and the film could use a touch more dialog.Ask yourself what kind of movie-goer you are before you watch this. Are you a 'popcorn-movie-person' that likes the big-budget CGI stuff, or are you a film-buff or a person who really takes in the intricacies of direction and style.There's really no middle ground here - this is definitely an 'art' film.It's also a terribly violent film. The kind of violent that only a European, Aussie, or Scandinavian director knows. I don't know why they do a better job of it, but they do. Blood looks real, knives are the preferred weapon, and realism that is often hard to watch. Perhaps it's that regional-background-edge, coupled with his eye and ear, that push this film into 'elite' status. This film would fit in any of the last 4 decades and still be considered a masterpiece in any of them. There's a grit to this polished diamond too, and that is what makes it truly unique. It's like Von Trier, Villenueve, and Michael Mann had a Baby and you died and went to movie heaven.",9,14,23,20 February 2012
The Number 23," better than I was led to believe..
","A natural characteristic of films with many plot twists are occasional holes in the story. Movie's aren't required to fill in these holes but their void doesn't mean a film is terrible.I found 'The Number 23' to be an entertaining thriller that kept me guessing. Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen both give good performances and sell a complex, perhaps too complex, story about one mans'...make that two mens' obsession with the number 23.I found the symbolism relating to the dog was a nice touch. Reading some of the reviews here it is obvious that some didn't pull anything at all from the dog in the story...I thought it added a nice touch...and really led the audience to believe that Jim Carrey's character was destined for death. An earlier review said that they didn't like Jim's(Walter Sparrow's) narration because it gave away his fate..that because of it they knew he would live...?????......what planet was that reviewer from... narrators die all the time...and then many times they talk after their own death... terrible comment... this selection has been nitpicked to death... surely not for the acting, or the direction, or the story... but because of the uncomfortable ending, the fact that Jim Carrey is playing an unfamiliar role... and because it's hard to predict what's going on... THis isn't a fantastic film but it is MUCH better than I expected....so if you're like me....and have put this one off because of all the negative press... go ahead and give it a whirl.. you might be pleasantly surprised. 60/100You MIGHT like it if you liked:Stigmata, Session 9 , and Angels and Demons.",6,1,3,25 March 2008
22 Jump Street," if the original was solid, then this is movie diarrhea
","This stuff is right up my alley too. But, 22 Jump Street is a shred of the original,.. a terribly written, unfunny mess of a sequel.FOr me it instantly becomes one of the, imo, most-painfully- overrated movies on this sight. This film doesn't deserve to see the light of a 6-point-something rating, let-alone a 7-pt-something... No chemistry between the characters... everything that made me think the original was mindless hilarity, is painfully absent here.Definitely pass on this one. FIne with turning the rehashed idea into a self-aware, template sequel, but the omission of 'laughter' seals the deal for this piece of junk.I love stupid comedies, I love sex romps, buddy comedies, AND I really enjoyed the first one, but this film is as bland as an unsalted, plain baked potato. The best thing for me to do is forget this was ever made and watch the original a few years down the road.Painful.that would be my one word review if I could have left one.38/100 Will go down as one of the worst of the year without question. OUt of about 35-40 2014 releases I've seen so far - this is probably the second worst film I've seen, and in terms of disparity from the IMDb score... something is rotten in denmark... 7.3? I'm at a loss. Terrible, terrible movie. Expect a slow, but steady decline into 6.5-land, and it doesn't deserve that.To think that this now sits next to 'Anchorman'(7.3),and 'Swingers'(7.4) on the career ratings, is simply dumbfounding... a little disturbing actually.

Kick-Ass," here come those misled that this was supposed to be for kiddies. not. good movie though.
","What do all the detractors here have in common? They were sent here to protect our children from seeing this corruptive piece of trash.Uh...Hello.... It's rated R you nimrods. In case you forgot - that means the ratings board agrees with you that it isn't smart to take your 6 yr old to see this movie. The same thing happened on the 'Role Model'(also a good movie) reviews when the fire and brimstone goody two-shoe protectors of our children came out to warn us about the filthy mouthed black kid.back to the subject at hand.What a blast. First of all, the character of the 10 yr old killer has a pertinent background that makes perfect sense, fits perfectly in the story, and is a near le femme nikita believable representation and explanation of what happens throughout the entire movie.Much like defendor(also pretty good/notch below this though), Kick@$$ follows the regular Joe Smoe as he decides to dawn the uniform and fight crime.This is not a comedy. It's best that you know that going in - as it's obvious some American Pie fanatics have been disappointed based on some of the reviews on here(not the number, but the written reviews). What we have is a quirky and original superhero action flick that is just plain fun. If you wanna be politically correct or act like Leonard Maltin in search of an epically boring period piece then so-be-it... as for the rest of you - see this movie. This movie lived up to its' name. Thanks Mom... but I'm all growns up now....74/100You'll like it if you liked: Defendor, Spiderman 2, Scott Pilgrim, Face Off, Batman Forever, and Green Hornet.",7,6,16,10 May 2010
Gran Torino," vintage Eastwood
","Clint Eastwood fans will be smiling ear to ear. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a hardened, disgruntled Korean War veteran living in the ever-changing suburbs of Michigan.Gran Torino is a drama. It has many parallels with John Singleton's early nineties release, 'Boyz in the Hood****1/2(outta5)'.One of the surprising qualities of the film is it's humor. Walt is constantly throwing out fist pumping, 'dirty harry' tough guy lines. I have to say that the movie is extremely funny in what amounts to a serious character study.Perhaps the only negative thing that I can point out is that none of the supporting cast can keep up with Clint's stage presence and acting ability.Walt Kowalski is a role that is perfect for Clint. He's as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it and Gran Torino, if it is Clint's last, will be a grand exit and a fitting finish to an epic career. You'd think the 78yr old is invincible, unbreakable, but this film has some messages that made this viewer ask,'were they coincidence or was this Clint saying goodbye'. If for no other reason, see Gran Torino. 83/100",7,1,3,12 January 2009
Brave," Yes, this could have been even better, but it's certainly better than many of the negative reviews. See it.
","VERY MINOR spoilers.No, Brave isn't Pixars Best. Personally, I wouldn't even call it the best animated film of 2012(it did win the Oscar). I might give an ever-so-slight edge to Wreck-it-Ralph for that honor, but it's close. Ralph has a bigger heart, and more interesting characters, but the animation from Pixar for Brave, is frankly, in a different time-zone.You would expect from Pixar,.. it looks FANTASTIC. They continue to push the bar higher and higher in terms of animation.Secondly, it's not bogged down with too much music. I think this really opens-up the entire genre for rock-heads like myself, who don't care to listen to one celine-dion-esque sap-song after another.The pacing is excellent. There's no lulls in this one. I can't tell you how many times I've really enjoyed an animated film, only to have it start to bore me 2/3rd's of the way through(How to Train Your Dragon comes to mind - although I'm sure the comparison will throw some off).Brave is bold and beautiful to look at, and it has a pretty big heart as well. We don't get too many of these films that address mother-daughter relationship issues, and Brave definitely has its heart in the right place.The film is funny and exciting throughout.That said, what's keeping this at 77/100 for me is in all the little areas where the film could have expanded, but didn't. The back-story about rival clans and a cursed-prince fall flat. The film seems a bit-rushed at 1hr and 36 minutes, and to it's credit it flies by and entertains for sure, but I wouldn't mind seeing the 2-Hr and fifteen minute version that expanded on this story's history AND ending.Not at all surprised by the Oscar though, now that I've seen it.Recommended for sure.You Might Like This If You Liked:Beowulf(not nearly as good as this), The Incredibles(a touch better), and Coraline(even, or a touch better).good movie! I might have to review both Wreck-it-Ralph and Brave again to confirm my first instincts. They're both clearly the best animated films I've seen from 2012(granted, I've only seen 5 or 6). Don't put it off anymore if you have, it's about as adult-friendly a fine animated film as you're likely to see.",7,1,2,7 April 2013
World Trade Center," Truly offended. The Negative Reviews De-Bunked very quickly
","First, this isn't a political film, this is a character-driven film. I hate I have to even touch on the politics. The trade centers went down. Fact. Because of terrorists, fact. THey killed 3,000 people in 3 hours. Fact.The film doesn't show the towers falling down. The film doesn't mention anything about why, who, or what motivated anyone. It focuses on a small group of men, risking their lives to save others in the light of tragedy, and in the process, creates onE of the best dramatic duo performances of the decade.Cage and Pena are truly incredible here! Undoubtedly the best performance from Pena and Probably the second best performance or even equal to Leaving Las Vegas for Cage. Tour-De-Force acting. Surprised Michael didn't get an Oscar nom here. I can see why anti-American's would hate this film. It shows everything that is great about Americans and New Yorkers in 2 Hours.It's quite simply the best 6.0 film on IMDb, and more deserving of 8/10 imo. 81/100 is where I'm scoring it. It's not the best film I've ever seen but it's a very strong film, and easily top 10 for the year it was released. The film is about the moment, not any motivation or reaction. Period. Get a life people.Watch this movie if you haven't. Strike every 1-2 star rating as American-hate - No movie with these types of performances should even sniff those low-scores... the movie doesn't have an agenda but anyone who would score it a 1-2, with this quality, most assuredly does(you can take that to the bank). 1 or 2? I mean seriously? Did you even watch the movie? No. THey didn't. And if they did, I couldn't trust any other review they'd ever given/written. Moronic.Very. Good. Movie. At the bottom of Stone's Top-5 imo.Here is how good the movie is... the worst thing about it... is Maria Bello's contact lenses.",8,10,17,31 January 2016
Prisoners," a rewatch confirmed that it covered many more bases than I originally thought. One of the years best, no doubt.
","I like the way the film doesn't beat-around-the-bush in the set-up. The 'disappearance' comes in the first ten minutes of the film.Loads of other strengths here.The production overall is excellent. The acting across the board is fantastic. Each character has depth. I love the way the film explores the mental and physical anguish of not just the parents, but the police officer and the accused.Jake Gyllenhaal's character is a steady force in this film. We'd like to know a bit more about his background as viewers, but it's nice to see a police officer portrayed with such dignity.That said, 'Prisoners' stand-out performance is delivered by Hugh Jackman. I'd go as far as to say it's the best performance of his career.All of the plot-nit-pickers on other reviews are obtuse... I watched the film a second time to see how the film covered it's bases, and literally everything was covered. There's nothing to nit-pick. Even the character consistencies are accurate. ANd after the re-view I'm tempted to up this to 9.LATE EDIT - I have now up'd this to 86/100 - in hind-site the film covers practically EVERY base... amazingly.Very tense film. Has a lot of moral questions to ask about victims AND police officers. The climax where Jake G is speeding in the rain is perhaps the most intense scene I've seen in years. It's incredibly well-shot. IMO the definitive moment of the film - when director and cinematographer take the build-up of the previous two hours and work it into an amazing crescendo. An absolutely AMAZING scene. The whole film paces, but the last 25 minutes is by far the best. Questions I had about Joy's escape, Alex's involvement, and the ending were clearly answered the second time around - I just missed them. SImple as that - as I suppose others did too.highly recommended. 84/100. The film isn't perfect, but it's very, very good. Not too many good thriller/drama's in 2013.. but this is rt up there with MUD, The East, Place Beyond the Pines, and Disconnect as one of the years best.You will like this if you liked:Zodiac(about even), Silence of the Lambs(about even - yea I just said it), or The Lovely Bones(not as good).",9,1,2,3 January 2014
Everest," I felt like I was there... with a bunch of people I didn't know unfortunately
","The film looks great, but without any character-development we really don't care what happens to who down the stretch.I rather enjoyed some of the accurate time-line and preparation stuff in the first 30 minutes of the film. Really stuck to the genuine article in terms of time-line and locations.It reminded me a bit of 'World Trade Center' with it's cliché'd grieving, worried-wife characters, and similarly lacks the early scenes to create an impact down the stretch. At least World Trade had two powerhouse performances from Cage and the under-rated Michael Pena.Here we have a film with similar acting firepower but it never comes to fruition. The most interesting character here is Jake Gylenhaal, but much like the rest of the characters - he just doesn't have enough screen-time. I think the film tried a little too hard to depict all the characters that lost their lives, and in-turn didn't flesh-out any of them.I mentioned I liked the set-up... I also liked the climbing scenes.. really well-done. Especially near the summit. You really feel like you're rt up there.The film is just above average overall, and for me falls in the middle of the pack of movies I've seen from 2015(probably about the 30th best film out of about 60 so far). It perhaps has some re-watch value for entertainment-purposes only. Definitely not for performances, drama, or style, but unfortunately and unexpectedly for it's 'popcorn-only' value.I'd have liked to get to know these characters a little better.. I mean they made such an effort to show us all of them... They might have needed to make it 3 hours to do it, but I think I would have much preferred that 'Everest' over this one.",6,0,0,25 January 2016
Blood Diamond," might have to be the years best!
","After 'The Departed' won Best Picture...I continue to compile films that are easily superior to the Oscar winner. I thought 'Pans Labrynth' was a little better than Scorceses flick, but this one is better than both. You are unlikely to forget the characters or the impact of this great movie. Where the ending may bring mild scrutiny, and the accuracy of the political nature of the film may be questioned,....this is still one powerhouse of a movie. Leonardo and Djimons' performances are dead-on. The two bring a power to the film that is only equaled by the fantastic an under-appreciated action sequences. The film is incredibly well-fashioned and the plot flows with grace while never leaving the viewer with any of those 'uncomfortable' lulls in the story or in its action. It gains momentum early and then builds to a fantastic fallout of superb thrills and first-rate performances. I find it hard to believe that a film with such a benign premise(the sale of a valuable conflict diamond) can be so fantastically entertaining.....more entertaining than films that have even more interesting story lines....like say 'Children of Men'....which I find to be a good film...but one that takes a great premise and makes it good....where 'Diamond' takes a basic storyline and executes it to near perfection.....the script, the performances, the action, the sheer entertainment...this is a can't miss in my opinion! If it would have ended on the mountainside....or with the reunion(minus the 'hearing'/'meeting') it would have been a 10....a minor and trivial negative....either way...YOU WON'T BE Disappointed with this selection! 88/100You'll like this if you liked:The Power of One, Catch a Fire, or Body of Lies.",9,1,2,13 April 2007
Taken," WOW! get outta the way!
","This is one heck of wild ride.Think if 'Trade' met 'Kill Bill Vol.1'. 'Taken' is one of the most furiously exciting action movies I've seen in a long, long time. The only reason this goes from 10 to 9 is because there is so much action that the character development wanes a bit, but I PROMISE, you will not care.There is nothing original about the plot. There are no Oscar worthy performances(Neeson is great though). Taken derives it's power from it's lead characters' strength and willingness to do ANYTHING to save his daughter.Have you ever watched one of these movies about despicable people and you're always sitting there wondering why the hero never makes them pay enough of a price? Well, in a nutshell, that's why I love this movie. It's the gift that keeps on giving.The action will drain you and the movie flies by like the concord.I doubt there will be a more exciting movie released in the U.S. in 2009. Taken is one that I'll be adding to the library. The most fun I've had watching a popcorn action flick in years.Simple premise. A little cheesy to start. Then foot on the gas.Fammke and some of the other cast bring it down a notch but from minute 25 to minute 90 you'll be on the edge of your seat. A very small price to pay.I can't stand the negative reviewers on this one... in a movie like this someone has to be stereotyped... some nationality... some group... you have to... so what you have is about 5 negative reviews from Albanian's and Frenchmen that dislike the stereotype... nothing more... to give this any less than 6 stars is disclosure for, 'I am an idiot'.Cliché'd, yes. Overly violent, yes. Tough subject matter, yes. THe occasion bad line or suspect acting, yes. BUT, WHO CARES? This movie makes the Bourne series look BORING. I had a grin on my face for the last hour. This is what I want from a movie... my money's worth.. 8/10 85/100",9,2,5,28 October 2008
The World's Fastest Indian," inspiring, but not 8+ material.
","It's inspiring, it's not overlong, and Anthony Hopkins is solid.Past that, there are a few issues. The first issue I have is that many of the supporting performances are pretty wooden, poorly written, and really don't contribute much to the film at all - especially when the film gets state-side.I also thought the 'playboy' aspect really detracted from the film. It really doesn't make sense that you portray the guy as a broke hermit and then have every eligible female taking him to bed. What was one of the terrible lines in the film,'poor old men need love too', or something to that effect.Hopkins saves the day, as does the entire motorcycle plot along with the films last half hour.I recommend it, but some of the direction and some of the performances detract from what could have been a great film. THe true story, the motorcycle stuff, and the lead performance are all great, but the film is just good overall.",7,0,1,23 February 2015
Grindhouse," I think I might have found the best film(s)/or at the very least the best theater experience of '07!
","Considering that Grindhouse's' two films were meant to pay homage to the action/horror/exploitation grindhouse films of the 70's and 80's....this has to be one of the years best. Both films can easily stand on their own as fine pieces of work, although, the two films couldn't be more different. Planet Terror takes us back to the early John Carpenter films. The characters are funny and Rodriguez did a fantastic job of incorporating the 'B' movie staples like Michael Biehn and Jeff Fahey.....both steal the show. There is an uncanny balance of style, comedy, horror, gore, and action. Freddy Rodriguez shows he is VERY capable of being the lead. Terror starts Grindhouse with a loud bang. The film's central focus is style, campy comedy themes, and in-your-face gore. 'Deathproof' from Tarantino is a fantastic film that uses the director's strengths...action sequences and funny dialog. I thought Deathproof was a well thought out slasher/revenge flick centering around two groups of girls....one group vulnerable....the other...tough. The soundtrack is absolutely awesome and the two hour running time flys by even faster than Planet's 85 minutes.....it's a close race but I think Deathproof is the better of the two. Both films are successful homages and this is easily one of the best for 2007...as a matter of fact....so far this is #1 in my book. A flat out awesome way to spend 3 and a half hours. For what both directors were going for....they hit the nail on the proverbial head while keeping true to themselves.... this is an awesome movie experience..... Hopefully the directors won't take the hit at the box-office to heart considering this is close to the best work for both. Awesome!! Awesome!! Awesome!! Box Set Please!! 87/100",8,0,0,23 October 2007
Super 8," The first 25-30 minutes is fantastic... then... well... not so much... it's going to sound like I hated this - but I didn't.
","THIS IS CHOCK FULL OF SPOILERS EVEN THOUGH THE DIRECTOR TURNED THIS INTO ONE OF THOSE MOVIES WHERE THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SPOIL.Man... I really, really wanted to love this movie. I went in with high expectations. I literally went to the rental box at 9AM Tuesday to ensure myself a copy for Tuesday night's 'Mexican/Movie' night at the house. The burrito's were awesome - the movie was alright.Not only did this one have to meet my high expectations, but it also has to be compared to masterpieces like E.T. and Close Encounters of Third Kind(don't blame me for that - Abrams and Spielberg knew that would be the case). If you're gonna make a movie like that for a 38 year-old guy like me - you better do it right.The set-up is fantastic. I was as giddy as a schoolboy who'd just confirmed his first girlfriend throughout the first 30minutes or so of this film. The story planted all the ingredients for a great epic.The band of kids are aspiring film-makers. The idea to use that was completely squandered in the second half of the movie - as were many other possible subplots.I was expecting the government to hunt the kids(and for them to run from them/not just pop into a classroom and snatch them) - didn't happen. I was expecting more out of their developed film(not just hand it to dad at the end of the film and say watch this) - didn't happen. I was also expecting the story to focus more on its' lead character to drive the story - and that didn't happen either. Instead the film dives into to some really meaningless alien crap('I touched him and he just wants to go home), and turns a great set-up into an alien show fresh with hanging human bodies for food, and our lead talking himself out of being eaten. This film started to take all the wrong turns right at the point where it showed the doctor had survived the crash.Basically, there were hundreds of opportunities to take advantage of subplots that had already been touched upon, and then the film didn't do it. Instead, the last hour of the film is nothing more than a big jumbled editing mess.I'm a little ticked off because all the elements they needed to make this a fantastic(and I mean REALLY fantastic)movie were RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THEM.I'm no film-maker, but I could take the ideas that these film-makers had put into the first 30 minutes of this film and made this film into a masterpiece. You could have too. The set-up is freakin' brilliant.There were three chances to put the government on the kids heels. And, I know they picked them up... later... for no good reason... That subplot really needed either a chase scene, or some follow-up on the general's part to find out why the empty film box was at the train station. And, every moment that the kids were filming close to the action - I was waiting for that Raider's of the lost Ark moment when the government looked in the distance on the hill and wondered - is that Indy digging the Well of the Souls over there? NO, these kids just film government operations freely. When the general looks out the window and does see the kids filming outside the house - what happens? - NOTHING! next. Is that the best we can do on the ending? the little radioactive rubic's cube flies to the water tower, attracts everything metal within a mile radius, turns into a ship, and flies the alien away? What happen to the Astin approach in Goonies where the one brave kid leads the others into the eye of the storm? The set-up was there. Instead of him running from the government, leaking his video, or leading his band of misfits against the man - we get 'go save the kids'...I thought it was about the kids, and then Abrams turns them into complete weaklings by deciding to go save them all of the sudden. I wanted these kids to save themselves. I wanted them to keep diving into the situation. Personally, I don't think we needed to see the alien at all(at least past the glimmer of it on tape). This film needed to be about the government moving in, and the kids not moving out, trying to figure out what was going on. It needed to be about the kids saving the girl from the government and not the alien.Funny. I'm still giving the film 6 stars. I just wasn't expecting to wake up today and score this the same as the rom-com 'How Do You Know' from Sunday.Obviously, the production values are top-notch. The kids as actors are passable(one early scene with Elle Fanning is particularly effective), and again, the first 30 minutes is amazing. I just hated to see this thing spiral out of control for the last hour. The first 30 DID remind me of Goonies, E.T., and Close Encounters, and it was up to that standard, but the last half reminded me of the remake of 'War of the Worlds' in a very bad way.Can you tell I'm disappointed? It's not so much with the overall quality of the film - as it is with the squandered opportunities in the storyline.",6,2,3,23 November 2011
Woman in Gold," Good, could've been great.
","This is a good movie. Mirren is excellent, Reynolds passable, but overall a good film. Reynolds' character is under-developed, and that takes away from the films overall impact. A little more family background on reynolds character would've gone a long way. Instead, we don't feel the emotional implications concerning his ancestry, and some of those scenes just aren't as effective as they could have been. Not the case with Mirren - her story is complete. This could have been Really good if reynolds character had been better developed. Otherwise,.. the film is excellent. I don't know if we should blame the casting, the writing, or the performance, and i do normally like Reynolds. I don't want it to sound like its a bad film, because it's not. Quite good actually.The flashback scenes are excellent, the score is incredible, and the story itself is mesmerizing. Yet, it's still just a 'good' film that stands a marginal chance at holding onto a top-25 for 2015 spot come next spring.U might like this if you liked: The Book Thief( a notch better), Sarah's Key(actually not as good as WIG), The Queen(a bit better), or Escape From Sorbibor((better/great sleeper).69/100 Defo worth a rental.

National Treasure," Benjamin Gates and the Raiders of the Lost Treasure
","'National Treasure' isn't a great film - nor is it a terrible one.The film's opening set-up is nice. Always good to see Christopher Plummer. Right after the films' initial set-up, it jumps right into the slightly monotonous clue after clue storyline that it follows for the duration. Most of the scenario's are extremely far-fetched, but the production values, music, and cast help numb-us to the fact that this story is beyond implausible. The film is never boring or dull, but it also isn't as funny as it thinks it is. Riley and Ben take jabs back-and-forth throughout the movie, and almost none of them work comically.The journey here is one that can be enjoyed for the visual sight-gags(for lack of a better term), and the historical contexts used throughout the film.I for one felt like I was rooting them-on as they went from one clue to the next, and the film, while not necessarily deep or well-written, is bolstered by a cast that makes the most of an average script. Bean, Kruger, Keitel and Voigt really add some substance to this otherwise childish affair.This is definitely a guilty pleasure for me. I realize how ridiculous this whole thing is, but the pacing and 'intrigue-around-every-corner' make this infinitely watchable despite all it's short-comings.This is surely an audience divider, but if you like 'popcorn-fare' you should enjoy it. If you prefer historically accurate, dramatic films, then I'd pass on this one.63/100 I gave the sequel similar marks.",6,2,3,3 September 2013
Sicario," Artistically... it may be the best film of 2015...
","This film just looks amazing. A lot of care went into this. I wish our lead here(Emily Blunt) got the same development and fully-fleshed-out journey throughout the film as Melissa Desormeaux- Poulin did in Villeneuve's 'Incendies'.Blunt's character here is a little too weak for my tastes. It kinda messes with the plausibility and effectiveness here. One begs to ask the question why she would ever be asked to come along. I mean it seems obvious in the film that her character is in over her head, and it really makes things a bit of a mess for me as the viewer.Shame too because this film is quite simply amazing. The cinematography is incredible. Villenueve's grasp of moving action and steady, almost Mallick-like steady pans with vibrant color and attention to detail is truly amazing.If you've ever wanted a film to be the epitome of an incredible 'shooter game' - then this is it. SOme moments late in the film had me standing up in front of the television with anticipation and excitement.As a thriller, it works because the action is done so well, and because the 'revenge quotient' is high. The film WILL do nothing but further excite those in anticipation of Villeneuve's 'Blade Runner 2' project. He's the right man for the job. ANd this film does nothing to change the fact that he is EASILY one of the top 1 or 2 directors to watch right now.WHile the characters here lack a little depth, and the story doesn't really know where to put them most of the time, the film still works. One of the most visually stunning films in a few years. A couple of years ago, slammed behind his other film 'Prisoners' and another film with similar strengths and weaknesses, 'Place Beyond the Pines', 'Sicario' may not even make the top 10, but for 2015 this is EASILY top 10, and sitting on the 're-watch as soon as possible' list. I saw a film that was also supported by it's look last night, 'The Walk'. It also lacked some character development and had some tonal issues.. and it looked good. BUT, 'Sicario' went above the 'grand look' and leaked way over into artistic masterpiece territory.I don't know how 'accurate' this is in terms of subject matter, but it certainly seems very realistic. I just wish they would have made Emily a little more of a tough-girl.He cared about this one. 83/100You'll like this if you liked:Babel(about even), Prisoners(a little better), Trade(not as good), or Eden(not quite as good but decent sleeper to try out).2015 has been slow to come around, but certainly it could be argued that 'Fury Road' and 'Sicario' are two of the more visually stunning films of this century. I would have loved to have seen this on IMAX.",8,3,5,8 January 2016
The Descent," fresh ideas, genuine scares...I love this movie.
","Yes, there is a soft spot in my heart for mid-budget, lesser known horror films. The Descent throws a band of British female friends into the dark,unknowingly inhabited depths of an American cave. Before that, the film gives us a shocking and essential back-story to the group....a characteristic usually void for the genre. The film starts with meaning....then it begins to build tension...the tension seems to grow to an incredible crescendo right when this film really goes horror...and in a deliciously BIG way. There is a beautiful balance of positives here...the music, the pertinent back-story, the well-fashioned gore, the lighting and tension...the chronic, unrelenting nature of the situation... this movie basically knocks it out of the park. An uncomfortable, ghoulish, terrifyingly terrific horror flick. A must see for fans of the horror genre. The premise seems unrealistic but it is pulled off in quite the opposite manner. It feels like your right there with 'em.....that's what makes this a real winner. This movie buff says, 'Highly Recommended'. 81/100",8,1,3,13 November 2007
Jack Reacher," negative reviewers reaching for something bad to say
","Somebody mentioned how Reacher was unaffected by a baseball bat to the head. They obviously missed a couple things. One, he WAS seriously dazed, two, the doorway absorbed nearly all the blow from the bat(your 'criticism' was actually a nice little detail. It's one of many unsubstantiated criticisms I've read.But, it's to be expected. Any Tom Cruise flick gets it's fair share of unfair criticism.'Jack Reacher' is an entertaining 'tough guy' yarn similar to Clint Eastwood's 'The Rookie'. Actually a bit better.The story is interesting enough, and the cheesy one-liners work because Cruise is in top form here.The film doesn't overstay it's welcome, it has a clearly defined climax, and I'd pay to see the sequel on the big screen. What more can I say?70/100You'll like this if you liked 'The Rookie/eastwood'(not quite as good), Absolute power(about equal), and Nick of Time. There are some nice moments for the gearheads, and the film is never boring.Robert Duvall and Richard Jenkins are effective in two smaller roles, but Cruise is definitely the stand-out.It is a bit of a throwback with the carchases and the complete void of cgi(did you smell that fresh air?).A nice blend of action, comedy, and whodunnit.The film isn't perfect, but it's well worth a watch, and it just cracked my top 25(#23) for 2012.",7,8,17,10 May 2013
It's a Wonderful Life," wasn't the first and won't be the last of the classic's I 'get around to', but so far, it's one of the best
","I didn't feel comfortable in my skin a few years back. My friends and family considered me 'the movie buff'. In a way, I was. I'd seen about 4,000 movies, and covered literally everything worth watching since 1980, but I hadn't broken into the vault of classic films. I'd seen a few.Wuthering Heights(9.5/10) and The Wizard of Oz(10/10) were two of my favorite films, both from 1939. I'd also seen 1939's Gone With the Wind(9/10), Dark Victory(9/10), and a few other classics:The Killing, King Kong, Frankenstein, Dracula, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, War of the Worlds, Mr. Smith goes to Washington, and some Hitchcock.Citizen Kane, It's A Wonderful Life, and Casablanca sat embarrassingly on my watchlist. So did a litany of great classic films.My journey to fill this void has been an exciting one.It's a Wonderful Life is a great film for those who haven't given classic film a chance. It doesn't overstay it's welcome. The production values are strong, and the story is a template for many of today's films. Seriously, I can name 500 films from the last 2 decades that use this story/life-lesson, but I can't name one that does it quite as effectively as it's done here.It's a film that is practically impossible to dislike.James Stewart is fantastic, and many of the characters in the film teach us life lessons, not just the lead. Words like integrity, generosity, and sacrifice take on a whole new meaning.The film doesn't really have the holiday vibe I was expecting until the last 40 minutes. The holiday season is nothing more than a platform to remind us of all that is important in life. That aspect of the film surprised me.Good guys don't finish last. Why? Because when they're down, there's always someone there to pick them up.I can see all the reasons why there are those like me that shy(d) away from Classic film. You have to take some of the customs of the day and the production stuff with a grain of salt and get past it. Or better yet, understand it. If you do - you'll find what's underneath to be fantastic. A week before the release of 'The Hobbit', I think it's important to remember that as much care or more went into productions like this back in the day.Now, I get all the references to this film that I missed over the last 40 years. I see the shots of the town and the snow that will forever be etched into my mind. It's amazing how all those 'production and technology' issues from the time yield more memorable moments and shots than just about anything you'll see at the theater today.This is a fantastic movie. 95/100",10,2,4,7 December 2012
Edge of Tomorrow," What were the chances, right?
","Looks like a knock-off of District 9 and Elysium. Stars Tom Cruise. Bares a scary resemblance to Transformers:Dark of the Moon's trailer.That's why, when I saw the score actually rising in the second and third weeks after release, it got my attention. That's the opposite of what usually happens with these cgi infested summer blockbusters.The a-typical rushed set-up and lackluster first 10 minutes had me a little concerned that I had somehow been duped, but it wasn't long before all those concerns were squashed.'Edge of Tomorrow' is about as good as these types of films can be. It's better than the ORIGINAL Transformers, better than Oblivion, and NEARLY as good as District 9.Tom Cruise is excellent. THe acting all around is solid, but definitely not the key to the films success.THe best thing about this is that the CGI is all-over-the-place yes, but it's executed nicely. The plot isn't over-convoluted or too confusing, and while it all seems familiar, the time-jumping aspect adds A TON to the overall product. Mostly, it adds a fantastic comedic element.The action is fantastic. The film isn't overlong. And the ending is strong.Highly recommended. Haven't seen many 2014 releases so far, and I usually see about 90-110 films from each year. THAT SAID, this one will be hanging around the top 25 for 2014 like a vulture to a carcass.Awesome flick! Pure adrenaline! See it on the big screen. Best 'popcorn fare' I've seen since 'The Avengers', only it's a notch above that fine film. Also enjoyed it more than Captain America Winter Soldier. Both good films, but this even better.You'll like this if you liked: Lockout(nowhere near as good), Elysium(a clear notch below), Avengers(not quite as good), Aliens(a tad better), or Starship Troopers(a notch below).83/100..actually entertained '9' for about a minute or two.

","If you haven't seen this - the first thing you should know is that this is a relatively 'small' movie. 3 million budget, young unknown director, casts the up-n-coming Miles Teller(brag and say I predicted his future success rt after watching '21 and Over') and JK Simmons known as 'the bald farmers insurance' guy.. the script is light in weight, the film didn't do great at the box-office but wasn't in many theaters to begin with.. Before I keep going I'd like to note that I've only given 43-'10's' out of 3450 ratings since I joined IMDb in 2006.For me, this wasn't a film that 'squeeked-in' either. It's my favorite film in a long, long time.What I love about 'Whiplash', is that despite it's meager spec- sheet, it's packs one serious punch. That punch starts with J.K. Simmons, who deservedly brought home the Oscar for this performance. Right from his first sighting he commands the screen, and he quickly becomes one of films' most memorable antagonists. JK's 'Fletcher' is a menacing figure. He holds futures in his hands, let's you know it, and isn't afraid to abuse the privilege. But, what really sets this character apart is that we still can't figure him out when the credits role. We certainly question his methods, but does he really have these kids interest at heart? We know(or think) that he feels some guilt because of a lie he tells about the death of a former student, but other moments like a hallway scene with what looks to be a former student make us question our hatred for the character.That's one of the amazing things about this film - the two lead characters are psychologically damaged, but driven men, and they lead us through a story that is much deeper at its' core than it is on the surface.The film begs to ask the question, 'At what price?'.This small film will linger with you for days.'Whiplash' has a lot of other stuff going for it. There are some individual scenes here that are incredibly well-written, incredibly well-shot - the types of scenes that you won't soon forget. The break-up, the dinner scene, the early Shaffer scenes, and my God the ending. When Neiman's Dad is looking through the crack of that stage door we are mesmerized!!If you don't like this movie - you don't have a pulse. Don't get me wrong - I knew what the critics/detractors would say before I even looked. 'That's not Jazz', 'It's Unrealistic'(quickly becoming the cliché I look for in negative reviews that says to me, 'WATCH IT' - well, that and negative reviews that use the word cliché'd), and musicians and teachers that feel misrepresented,.. this and that of course there's those 'sensitive whussification of America' types that say it glorifies abuse. Hogwash!Forget that crap. Especially those giving it 1 or 2... I mean REALLY?!?!? 1 or 2??? I reserve ratings like that for 'Master of Disguise' or 'A Cold Day in Hell', not for good(make that great) films that you might have 'moral issues' with.This film is a psychological kick-drum to the face. It's brisk running time and that thin script just add to the mystique. I could watch the ending 50 times, and probably will.A week later, after chewing on everything in your head, you'll start to ask yourself if 'everything' Fletcher did was calculated. But then that would make him a decent guy? Personally, I think that he IS truly evil either way, but that is a notion that I'm still fighting with. It's that fine line between extreme motivation and abuse, and this film straddles-it for 85minutes. In the end, Fletcher loses, but doesn't ultimately lose much, and our antagonist rides into the sunset following what might be my favorite scene in film history Now, that's just one man's opinion.I love films like this that have such an amazing impact, but yet leave so much interpretation for the viewer.A MUST watch! 95/100 My fave since, hmmmm, Twilight Samurai or The Pianist maybe. It's been a while that's for sure.consider the potential 1.86 redbox charge as an instant coupon and go buy it! That's what I should have done. Hope it helps.",10,3,8,24 February 2015
Dark Shadows," nice set-up, lousy finish - only mild spoilers
","Tim Burton has had his share of the good, and his share of the bad.Dark Shadows starts interestingly enough, jumping through time and pulling it's lead character along the way, to the modern day(1972).Depp is the star of the show, and he's excellent here as Barnabus Collins, a fishery tycoon who's family has been devastated by tragedy.The film is absolutely charming for the first 40 minutes, and then it completely derails.Burton's story here is fine, but he fails to take advantage of many aspects of his own plot. Example. We get to see Depp venture into the daylight with umbrella and sunglasses in tow. But instead of seeing him interact with townspeople and keep driving this film in the comedy direction it was heading in - we get sloppy interaction between the same characters. None of them are as charming as Depp, and even Depp can't overcome the messy finish that accentuates a then rendered meaningless business struggle and drops the comedy nearly altogether.I wish something would have called me away from the flat-screen halfway through.I think Burton made a mistake by basically giving his core of 5-6 characters 99.999999% of the dialog. I also believe that he started all of the characters in the right place, and then really drove them in the wrong direction.The film was marred by shameless product placement, and hints of sequel story lines, but I don't think I'll be waiting in line for the next Dark Shadows.The first 40 minutes is extremely funny and interesting, but that's only part of what makes the last hour so disappointing.Positives. THe film looks fantastic. Danny Elfman doesn't contribute a whole lot to this in terms of score/theme, that's practically non-existent, but at least he uses some of the best music available from the era. Depp. The first 40 minutes.That's all I've got for positives.You Might Like This OR You Might Try: Fido(better), Edward Scissorhands(better), Monster Squad(slightly better), Adam's Family Values(slightly better)or Tommy Boy(slightly better).54/100",4,0,0,31 October 2012
Kong: Skull Island," Kong steals the show..
","It seriously would have played better without a single-speaking human in it.Kong:Skull Island isn't a bad little flick, but it isn't great either. Positives include some fresh ideas and spins on traditional Kong themes, and the CGI action with Kong is exceptional. THe negatives are non-stop stupid actions by the characters, a lack of an ending, and a poor script.When the film tries to be funny it isn't. And the film just follows such a cookie cutter modern-cgi-action template that is growing-old very fast. You might like this if you liked Warcraft, or the Transformer sequels, or John Carter. Some stuff stuck out really bad in terms of terrible improbability, and I guess it might be nit-picking if not for the frequency of such actions/scenes. The photographer taking nothing but bad pictures at inopportune times, and no good pictures at perfect times.. the helicopters flying at low-altitude after not one, not two, not three, but 6 or 7 hand been knocked down in quite a long-span of time... all that stuff just ultimately pulls the viewer away, and the script and the lack of scares and comedy do the same. Those fresh ideas end-up being squandered a bit and the film ends-up being nothing more than a lower-brow version of Nimrod Antal's 'Predators'. There's not a single-character in this film that gains any steam or likability. The closest is John C. Reilly, who tries his best to save the film, but ultimately fails along with the rest.I'd pass on this unless you just really like the shallow action- stuff. If so, Kong and the CGI could be worth it, I guess.",5,0,1,26 July 2017
Shooter," Built Ford Tough Early - hits the 150K mark(60minute) and Clunks out.
","Really strong start.Wahlberg is perfect for the role. 'Shooter' is a nice mix of 'The FUgitive' and 'Jack Reacher'.The action is great, and Wahlberg's acting here, which is mostly physical, is really good. There's some decent actors in supporting roles, but it's the political stuff that really 'gets in the way' here. WHen the film starts to dive a little too far into the political realm late, it really only highlights the improbability and ridiculousness of it all. We could have just shortened things a bit and left all of that a little more vague and it would have worked so much better.Or better yet, traded some of that stuff for the possible love-connection, while politically incorrect, might have added some spice with a little more impact than the political meanderings. It's like the ideas in the plot were good, but the execution failed. I think the writing in some of those scenes just kinda makes it seem a bit over-the-top. For example a late scene where he meets with the Secretary of defense and others is just awful. The pipeline stuff and mass-grave stuff are really good ideas, but the writing and scenarios/scenes for these ideas never come to fruition. BUT, there's a lot of good here. When they're not overdoing the political stuff, they're making an excellent action film. All the sniper-stuff is just cool, and Michael Pena is always a great under-rated casting.THis is a strong '6', and for action fans, I can certainly recommend this. Could've salvaged a 7 if not for some late/weak scenes.",6,1,1,29 August 2016
Arrival," grabbed a fellow movie buff and went to see this last night...
","Like I said, I'm a big movie-buff no doubt. I've seen about 4k films, and my sidekick for the night had seen about the same. We're always talking films, and when the wife stammered at the prospects of seeing 'Arrival' for my birthday, I called-up Chris and we decided to grab a brew and catch a movie.So I go in with pretty high expectations. Villeneuve had really caught my attention. From Incedies(8/10), to Prisoners(9/10), to Enemy(6.5-7/10), and Sicario 7.5-8/10.. I could easily say that Villeneuve is among the top 2-3 directors that I'm currently awaiting their next projects. I was giddy about him being attached to direct the new Blade Runner, and I went into the theater to see what all the hype is about(8.5imdb), and to get a look at Villeneuve's sci-fi ventures. We were disappointed. First, It's a heavy film. A very difficult watch. And while I actually dig the 'fill-in-the-holes' aspects of direction(on occasion) that don't feel the need to spoon-feed you everything, and I understand that this is also a characteristic of European directors, there is a point where it can become a distraction, and like the case here, end-up as a fairly empty shell, or an incomplete thought.'Arrival' is thought provoking, but far from 'entertaining'. The film moves at a snails-pace, and fails to really connect any dots down the stretch. It makes me want to watch it again to see what else I can figure-out about what it all means, but it will be another difficult 2 hrs, and may not be the most fruitful adventure. I'm no Albert Einstein, but I have scored above 120 on 3/4 official iq tests(119 on the other), and Chris is a smart guy too, but I also know that the movie community will flock to the ever-so-oft used, 'they just don't 'get-it'' fall-back. Oh I get it, and I found it to be very boring. It definitely made me try to connect a lot of the dots, and in that aspect it was a success. But, in terms of overall entertainment, or me being able to figure out what was trying to be said late... like an f-16 zooming over my head. That's the way I feel about the current 8.5 rating too. Really? Eeek. Amy Adams is good. The film looks great. There are a few really cool aspects in terms of Amy's interaction with the aliens, but past that... booooooring. The fact that we thought it was boring doesn't make us stupid - it makes us honest. We listened to the films' deep thoughts concerning time- continuum and seeing into the future... the whole dejavu aspect is at the core of the sci-fi, intellectual 'do you get it' here, but unlike say 'interstellar', what lies in between is far less 'entertaining'. We sat and watched the credits roll and talked about the film and about some of the ideas and concepts it dabbled-into in it's latter half, and none-of-it really made much sense, and the film just seemed so unconcerned-with it making sense, and even more so, keeping our attention.This film is NOT for everyone. I expect it will receive mostly favor from the hardcore movie-buffs on websites like IMDb, but I think this score is destined for the mid-7's, even if it takes a while, and will forever be considered an avante garde piece. THis is NO 'Close Encounters', that I can tell you unequivocally. It's not that cohesive, character-driven, or entertaining.62/100Probably not nearly as bad as I'm making it sound, but I(we) definitely left a little disappointed, and there was a collective audible gasp when the film ended. The kind you get when you see a film that dashed expectations. DId I mention it looks good? SOunds good too. Acting is solid across the board.I wouldn't recommend this to the average-joe. It's pretty tough for a seasoned movie-buff, and I wonder about the legitimacy of a large part of the positive written reviews, especially since so many were written before release and didn't cite the festival or location in which it was viewed. All this coming from the guy who drew conclusions and read into the depths of a film like say, 'Goodbye Dragon Inn'. Very, very ambitious, and very, very deliberate. A tough watch!Call me stupid - I'm sticking with 6/10. That rewatch won't be anytime soon. Dunno if this was a tune-up or just an artistic vision that just doesn't translate into a cookie-cutter mold. SOme people will praise it for that - personally found it to be lacking too much... character-depth.. cohesion... no defined climax.. meaning? A little dumbfounded this morning.",6,1,5,19 November 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," a superb and moving film.
","I stopped to see Shawshank when I was driving through Cincinnati. The theater was speckled with moviegoers.. all unaware of what an incredible cinematic achievement they were about to witness. There wasn't the slightest sound from the audience....they were mesmerized. The Jail(was in Mansield,Oh./now torn down), the music, the fantastic performances from a slew of great actors, Whitmore as Brooks, Robbins as Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman as Red,..they all did a spectacular job. This is a film(one of the few)...that will leave it's audience in tears of happiness. The narration from Freeman is written with care and this film is crafted and paced with a precision that Hollywood hasn't seen in a long, long, time. 'I hope to see the Pacific...I hope it is as blue as it is in my dreams'. This film addresses many moral trust issues....from being raped in jail, to finding a friend amongst criminals, to being unjustly incarcerated and then shunned when you prove your innocence..'how could you be so obtuse?'.....in the end it is the simplest thing, friendship, that is synonymous with freedom. This was the last time I was in a theater that cheered at the credits....and the only time an audience...so small in numbers...ever did that. One of my top 5 favorite films of all-time. 98/100",10,0,1,31 October 2007
Parasite," If thrillers were sagacious, poignant and funny
","Only mild spoilers.If you are looking for film that skillfully evokes a myriad of emotions from the audience - you've landed-on it! The Koreans have always been great at combining tones/genre's. Parasite Is a deftly handled film about social classes, income disparity(in particular, the psychological impact of it) and karma.Song Kang-Ho gives the standout performance as the father of a poor family who seems perfectly willing to break through any ethical walls to climb their way out of the slums.The meat of the storyline comes when the fathers' son infiltrates a wealthy household as an English tutor. Does the event spark an opportunity for financial freedom or horror for the entire family?This is both a visually and intelligently spectacular vision, played out to near perfection. There is some great symbolism throughout the film - the highs of high society, and the drowning abyss of the lower class. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking.The film is also as funny as it is thrilling. Hopefully American audiences can take all of the comedy-in as some can literally be lost in translation and dryness.The films' not perfect. I think the poor fathers emotional state could have been fortified a bit with a longer opening set-up; if for no other reason but to drive home the income disparity impact in Korea. Americans may not fully understand the dangers of income disparity and the 'monopolization and manipulation of capitalism(a good system but not necessarily a foolproof one), but perhaps watching this will help. That aspect of the ending is a slightly under-developed, or just perhaps under-appreciated according to your demographic, though the ending as a whole is still well-fashioned and thought-provoking.I've only seen a few of the Best Picture nominees(Fordv8, 19178, Once Upon a Time7.5-8, and Irishman7) , but this is clearly my personal favorite. It wont win. IMO, The Oscars gifted 'The Artist' the 'foreign acknowledgement Best Picture' a few years back, so it may be awhile before we see another one. Not that there haven't been many that should have one or at least been nominated. On direction, writing, acting, cinematography, and pure enjoyment - this film checks every box for me.You might like this if you liked: The Host(7), 3-Iron(7.5-8), Nightcrawler(8), Sympathy for Mr.Vengeance(8)",9,11,16,5 February 2020
The Conjuring," solid, but not as outstanding as some of the first page reviews
","I'll start by saying that I enjoyed this film, but the film suffers from a few things.The first. 'The Conjuring' fails to conjure-up ANY new ideas. We've seen all this before, and stylistically the film doesn't offer anything to separate it from those other, similar films. I'd give the film a 7 on the scare-meter, but I thought the look was a bit too 'dry-70's-drab'.The second. The film fails miserably in the music department. We get one or two 70's songs thrown-in-the-mix, but where is the traditional score, and the creepy music? The film just lacked that extra-ooomf. It's really hard to explain, but I'll try.THe film needs a more serious threat. There's not ENOUGH carnage here. I don't need a slaughterhouse, but bumps and bruises are about as serious as this threat gets. They had the opportunity to take it over the top and off a couple of meaningless characters, but they failed to do it. I understand that they're keeping true to a so-called true story, but who cares about the historical accuracy of any of this? Honestly?So what did I like? What effects are here - are done well. The overall production values are high, the acting is solid because the cast is solid and the writing is fine.There is a parallel narrative to this story which goes unexplained and really serves only one purpose - to plant a seed for a possible sequel.Call me crazy, but I enjoyed Aja's 'Maniac' as much as I liked this(just to throw-out the last horror film I watched). 'Maniac' had no scares, but at least it had a little style. 'Halloween' and 'House of the Devil' put a little flair into the seventies - this didn't.It's funny how we sometimes put films like this on a pedestal, perhaps because the genre has been struggling to regain form, but I found this to be no better than other lower-rated films like 'The Haunting in Connecticut', and not much better than some very average entries into the genre like 'The Last Exorcism' or 'Dark Skies'. It's amazing, having just said that, how much this movie uses from those last three films.Yet Another comparison would be 'Sinister' which is currently rated .7 lower than this, but I found that movie definitely HAD that something extra. The style, the creepiness, the music,... those IMDb-scores should be flip-flopped imo, but this is a newer release. I suspect the scores will get a little closer as time goes by.There were also a couple of things about 'The Conjuring' that I thought were a little inconsistent. Two that stand out came towards the end of the film(WARNING SUPER SMALL MEANINGLESS SPOILER ALERT). The first was when days after showing the family sleeping in one room, and after they had been through enough to never separate again, the film goes right back to showing one of the girls sleeping alone in a bedroom. By that point of the film it would have never happened... ever.. another moment of awkwardness for me came when Lily's character(the mom) steps out of the house and into the light and all of her injuries/bruising etc disappears.. I understand the thought, but the thought stinks. It would have added more credence to everything if those bruises remained. Those weren't the only little problems like this, but I've made my point.I don't mean to discourage anyone from seeing this because IT IS above average, and better than most of the crap in terms of new release horror.. just don't go into it with high expectations... might have been part of the problem for me. See Sinister first if you haven't. And if you watch this and like it - try out ALL the films I've mentioned previously. 63/100",6,3,5,20 November 2013
Never Back Down," can we get past all the cliché stuff
","we've reached a point where everything is a cliché... so it just drives me nuts when detractors harp on cliché this cliché that, the movie was horrible. The fact is, Never Back Down is FAR FROM a horrible movie.You won't be blown away by the lead... You won't be surprised with an unbelievable plot twist... but still, there are many redeeming qualities here. The direction and the music are quite sharp. A well defined climax, and some help from some fine acting in the supporting roles... Djimon is good and the mother is also quite good. I also liked how they postponed the fact that the lead had felt a sense of responsibility for his fathers death and the circumstances behind it.This film looks good...sounds good... it's entertaining, and despite some VERY familiar moments, Never Back Down delivers. You could do a lot worse with the whole teeny bopper OC genre. I was stuck between 6 and 7 but the undeserved rating here pushed me to the latter.65/100 I might even wanna check it out again before I return it.... and take a peak at the name of the director.",6,2,4,10 August 2008
Halloween," relentless... over-achieving... horrorART at its' absolute finest.
","First off... this is FLAT OUT the scariest movie in the last 40 years. The budget constraints really might have helped this movie. Haddonfield looks like your average American town... the girls...look like your average 70's HS girls(bellbottomsincluded). The score stands next to Jaws as one of Hollywood's best. Michael Myers' character is developed early on with a chilling opening sequence reminiscent of Hitchcock's' 'Psycho'. Thats when John Carpenter starts with the brilliant stuff. The nuances of fright-fare that have not been equaled since. Copied? Yes. But, equaled, No. Our killer lurking in the background....behind closed doors..outside the window..appearing between the blowing sheets hanging on clotheslines... ...Carpenter really shows his grasp of the genre with scenes like the one in the garage. SHe goes out...cars locked...she heads back inside to get the key... coming back out to the garage she reaches down and the door opens... she doesn't even notice that she didn't use the key... when she..and the audience realize it...it's already too late. Halloween builds like a Beethoven crescendo... for the first half of the movie we sit in fear of the inevitable....THEN.. WE GET IT! I've been around for 35 years...horror films perhaps my favorite genre... this is THE masterpiece.. For someone alone...at night...watching it for the first time... this one WILL give you nightmares. You know it's successful when I say 'letting a youngster get a hold of this at too early an age can have SERIOUS repercussions'. 10/10...and lost as to how anyone could score it any lower. Statistically, I believe this movie is 2nd in the investment/payoff ratio....always a sign of greatness. 95/100",10,0,1,19 March 2008
Blow," Commercial Doobage - Nothing Special, BUt It Does The Job
","'Blow' takes us on a roller-coaster ride that truly defines pot as a gateway drug. One quote from the movie sums it up, 'Danbury wasn't a prison, it was a crime school. I went in with a Bachelor of marijuana, came out a Doctorate of cocaine'.Step by step George Jung(Depp) gets deeper into the drug industry. As the risk goes up, so does the reward, and George isn't scared of anything. Depp is very good here - especially for what amounts to a likable stoner / entrepreneur.One of my favorite things about this movie is the music. Fantastic throughout. Buy the soundtrack. All the production values are high, and the life-lessons, while understated and under-developed, are realistic and heartfelt.Penelope Cruz's character is extremely shallow and unlikable. It's not so much her performance, but the audiences' disagreement with her character's inclusion in the film, and with George, that brings this film down a bit. I just don't think the audience likes to see the likable drug dealer with the mean material girl. For the most part, George surrounds himself with characters that are slimy but likable - ones that we don't seem to mind tagging along with on a two-hour journey to nowhere.Blow won't blow you away, but during the first hour when George is just opening the doors to his business, its fast-paced and exciting.Not everyone's cup-of-tea... it does glorify drug dealing to some degree(but how can you not in reality), and avoids the typical cookie-cutter Hollywood ending.64/100You'll like it if you liked: American Gangster, The Doors, King of New York, and The Boost.",6,0,1,8 October 2010
Casino Royale," The best Bond since the Connery Classics 'From Russia with Love' & 'Goldfinger'
","Casino Royale succeeds on many different levels. It gives us a fresh new face, a prequel-type story, and the superb action we've all come to expect from the franchise. The action scenes are superlative with some of the best stunt-work I've seen in recent years. Craig's bond is more realistic..athletic. For the first time, Bond's womanizing, training, and his cold-blooded nature are given true substance, instead of being an assumption(or at least the first time since On Her Majesty's Secret Service). We go on an emotional roller-coaster with Bond, feeling his pain, mourning his loss, finally realizing who he really is...The lack of gadgets is more than made up for in beautiful women, fast cars, and truly incredible action. The cinematography and overall look of the film is superb. I like the opening song, but the credit design could have been a little better. One of the few weaknesses. Better credit design and more gadgets and this would be my first 10/10 Bond film. Craigs one liners are sharp and witty, yet Bond seems to have outgrown the silliness and CGI, and graduated to the big time. 'Casino Royale' has solidified Craig's hold on 'Bond' for quite some time, and rejuvenated the franchise. This is easily the best Bond in over 20-30?-40? years and ranks up there with the top two or three in the entire series. I'm sure that may not sit well with some of the Bond ''traditionalist'..but IT IS that good.last thought....with the suspect acting we've seen from the female leads over the last six or seven films, Green is a breath of fresh air. 90/100 Bravo!",9,3,6,20 November 2006
Bull Durham," nuke and crash bash this outta the park!
","This is right there with The Natural and Long Gone as one of the three best baseball movies ever made(Ken Burns Doc as well if you were 'counting-it').It's perfect casting all-around. Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Kevin Costner, Trey Wilson, Robert Wuhl, and Jenny Robertson all deserve a mention. All the actors do a great job here.The film captures the small town feel, and to a somewhat regretful yet satisfying degree in terms of movie-enjoyment, the insignificance of minor league baseball.The love triangle between the three stars acts as the backbone for a hilarious script. The road-trip moments, the bar scenes, and the baseball action all seem quite believable/real, and the ending, while somber, works as well.Infinitely re-watchable, funny film about America's pastime, at what for me as a fan is a level that is just as intriguing if not more interesting and intimate than the 'big' leagues. Truly great sports movies are few and far in between. This is a pillar.87/100",9,0,1,17 April 2016
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Wes Anderson's Humor Fits Perfectly in a Children's Classic?
","How did they pull this off? The movie is chock full of low brow, a-typical Wes Anderson adult humor. Yet, the stop-action animation, the characters, and a great deal of restraint from the director, has magically turned Fantastic Mr. Fox into an instant children's and adult classic.Dare I say this is the funniest Wes Anderson film? It's at least on par with my previous favorite, Rushmore. There is some criticism here about the precision of the adaptation, regardless, it is Wes Anderson's screenplay that sells this movie. I have not read the book, but I'm sure that some sense of heart was moved over to this theatrical version.The voice overs and mouth animation is spectacular. I don't think people realize how difficult it was to make this movie. The stop-action look and feel is what will sell the kids, and Anderson's screenplay will sell adults. See this movie.My 2009 top ten: 10.I Love You Man 9.The Road 8.Trick r' Treat 7.Taken 6.Drag Me To Hell 5.Inglourious Basterds 4.The Hurt Locker 3.Up 2.Fantastic Mr. Fox 1.District 9That probably sums up my opinion. 92/100",9,2,6,21 December 2009
Midway," Does saying it's on Par with 'Pearl Harbor' help?
","You know, this films not terrible. It has its heart in the right place, and it's entertaining enough, despite being overlong.Skrein was a perfect casting as the cocky pilot. Many of the other names, that include Quaid, Eckhart and more, are lost in the shuffle. Skrein and Patrick Wilson(he's always solid) are the only two performances that really deserve a mention.The writing and cgi are subpar. The CGI looks so fake and often It used to manufacture very unrealistic action/war sequences. As of matter of fact, the writing isn't just subpar, it's terrible. Cringeworthy.That said I didnt turn it off. Its about as average to slightly below average of a blockbuster-type action flick as you're likely to find, but Im still a sucker for lots of action, explosions, heroism, and usually one to push-aside exact historical or visual accuracy.All the characters are under-developed. There's too many. The wives are completely ignored, though shown and introduced(why bother if your gonna drop them all like a bomb). So go ahead and make your list of the 10 people that will live and 10ppl that will die, and it will probably be accurate. There's nothing new about this, or old. Nothing stands out. It might be better than Pearl Harbor actually, though inferior aesthetically. I'd pass unless you are just bored And an action junkie- I was.",5,1,4,7 February 2020
Pitch Perfect," pitch-not quite perfect, but not-quite-terrible like the rest of these anyway - only mild spoilers(nothing to spoil really)
","The redeeming quality here is that 'Pitch Perfect' is a genuinely funny film.Not exactly up my alley, and that's why the mere fact that I considered this for a 7 star rating means you might think about adding this to your watch-list.I make it a point not to watch films like this, and after watching one of this caliber I believe I should lock away the key to the teeny-bopper-dance-musical genre forever, consider myself lucky to have procrastinated for so long, and run out of the casino like a thief on ACME jet-propelled skates.THe film is far from perfect. It suffers greatly from a completely ignored and under-developed relationship subplot. Too bad too - the actors seemed primed to pull it off in the few minutes that they were given to work together. The film also battles itself as it tries to tell the audience how 'tire-old' music just doesn't work anymore, and then uses it in the finale'. I mean, they got it backwards... the lead is literally the character put into the plot to finally break through and get these girls out of their funk by giving them fresh new music, and then she dishes out a classic in the end. Ironic to say the least.I think there was a point in there about classic movies/music that ended up in the trash of the editing room along with the love story here. There's another subplot that gets dropped like lead penny, and that's the musical aspirations of the lead character.I had another little issue with how the girls got into the final competition. The film, at times, really did seem like it was in the fight club scene where Norton was fighting himself, or Ash fending off evil in the evil dead series.I laughed my way through the first-half of the movie, but the second-half does lose some steam, and the final showdown doesn't stand out as much as needed to move this into this years top 25. Might make the top half of the 80-90 films I'll eventually view from '12(about 60 so far - would put this at about #26-27 rt now).This is usually where I put a 'If you Liked This You Might Like' list, but this was an out-of-the-box selection for me. Pardon the assumption that other films in this genre aren't this good. I don't wanna find out either way.64/100",6,0,1,23 January 2013
Heat," Very good, but not great.. here's why...
","First of all, I'm a huge Michael Mann fan. 'Heat' is a really good cat-and-mouse, cops versus robbers fare that thrives off of many of the directors trademarks.Of course most of the film is shot at night. Of course there's the Mann-trademarks of blue-hues/lights and stylish direction and music.Deniro's enigmatic performance went practically unnoticed. Robert's character seems much deeper than the script divulges, and he's the perfect ring leader. Great performance from Deniro here! Al Pacino is his cop-adversary in an over-the-top performance. I still haven't decided if Pacino and Mann went a little TOO far with his antics in this film. Pacino is just as on edge as Deniro - only he isn't afraid to vocalize it. This performance is like Pacino on steroids.The best thing about this film is that cat-and-mouse action. The interaction between the two groups is fascinating. One scene in particular where Pacino pulls over and invites Deniro to sit down and have a cup of coffee is fantastic. In another great scene involving the two Pacino says,'you know what they're watching? They're watching us'.The film moves at a nice pace, and doesn't seem like a 170-minute movie.I really didn't see any point in the relationship subplots here. These bad guys will obviously put just about anything behind their work:the threat of jail etc. I almost wish Mann had left all of the relationship stuff out of the script. It would have been different if he had established some genuine chemistry between some of these couples, but to me, it just seems more realistic that these women would have been kicked to the curb for business reasons. That's not to be sexist in any way. It's just an aspect of the film that really didn't work for me. I think the film would rank higher on my scale if Mann would have just eliminated all of that nonsense in exchange for more of the cat-and-mouse situations between the good guys and the bad guys. It also could have been a way to tighten this whole thing up and shorten it as well.Good movie, but not fantastic. I actually enjoy 'Manhunter' more, and think this is probably more on the level as 'Last of the Mohicans' and 'Collateral' in terms of quality from Mann. I don't think this film deserves a spot in the top 250, but it is extremely entertaining none-the-less.84/100 You'll like this if you liked: Collateral, Manhunter, Inside Man, or William Friedkin cop and robbers fare like The French Connection or To Live and Die in L.A.",8,1,3,23 January 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," grandiose.
","One of my co-workers, who's about my same age(40ish), was talking about an argument he was having with his 17yr-old son. The argument was whether or not the new 'Marvel' films were bigger and better, and whether or not the whole 'buzz' around them was bigger and better than the original Star Wars trilogy.I don't think the younger generation will ever fully understand the scale of the first trilogy. They MAY get a better understanding after JJ Abrams returns the trilogy to it's awesome roots.The first Star Wars film, known simply as Star Wars, was a land- breaking milestone of film-making, with a story, characters, and effects(not all effects are cgi people) that melded together into the greatest interplanetary adventure of all-time(at least until the sequel came out).Today's generation can pick between Spiderman, Ironman, Captain America, and the Guardians of the Galaxy to find the film that they love the most, but when I was a kid there was one film, or should I say one trilogy, that stood far, FAR above the rest. The number one argument that is made today by the younger generation is that the effects are outdated etc, but it was in fact Lucas' commitment(at least early on) to use models and make-up to create a world like no other. SOmething that CGI just can't capture. When I saw Guardians in the theater I thought it was amazing, but later I saw it on the 4K 60' TV, and like many flicks, it kinda accentuated the small flaws of the cgi and the set-pieces, whereas I watch Star Wars and it actually shows how amazing the film was in that aspect.CGI isn't necessarily an improvement. It's films like Star Wars and Blade Runner, whose 'Gritty' qualities actually add realism to an unreal world. The only problems I have with the first three Star Wars films are the 'digitally enhanced versions' that Lucas added later. That's why I eagerly await the original untouched films' release on Blue-Ray.Scores usually drop a bit over time, and as it stands now, the weakest of the original trilogy is scored 8.4(Return of the Jedi), and that is higher than Avengers, Guardians, Cap 2, and Ironman, and FOR GOOD REASON.And the original Star Wars is a superior film in every way as well. No Hokey opening like 'Avengers', no lack of storyline like Guardians, no under-menacing not required to act Villain like Cap 2, and while I can't nitpick anything about Ironman, overall it just doesn't stand- up against Star Wars, it's a beatdown.Simply put, it's EVERYTHING about it that makes it better. The acting, the story, the character development, the scale of the production, the start, the finish, the middle and every minute in- between.Part of the problem here is that the added material in the re- released versions really detracts from the original films flow. The stupid dancing crap in Jedi, the Walking Jabba in Star Wars, etc... it did nothing but hurt the original films. The only added footage that didn't detract from the original films was some of the added bells and whistles to 'Cloud City' in Empire, and Biggs early appearance in empire, which was wasn't an 'enhancement', it was cut-footage from the original tapes, other than that, the added stuff only hurt the overall quality of the original films. He basically added stuff that was the kind of stuff that ruined the second trilogy, so the original untouched films are still the real gem here. And that's not what these kids are watching either, because the untouched versions are HARD TO FIND!DOn't even exist on DVD or blu-ray. One of the times I'm glad I still have my VHS. Uh-Oh, Gotta-go, Re-tro:)And WHile I love the new marvel films, they don't have what Star Wars and it's two sequels(i'm a purist) have.. that tangible something you CAN put your finger on - because it's REAL.. they built those ships, they designed and made those costumes and set-pieces. That kind of attention to detail, and scale just isn't in the Marvel films. Sure, it's cool to see Hulk crumbling down a building, but this galaxy really doesn't 'SEEM' so far away in Star Wars. It has that 'realistic' edge to it. It's the reason that you couldn't make a legit remake of Ben- Hur, Ten Commandments, or other older 'epic' films... it would literally cost Billions.Even some of my favorite Sci-Fi's of all-time like Blade Runner and 2001, while milestones in their own right(especially visually), just do not have the sheer entertainment value that Star Wars has.97/100Star Wars and Empire are 2 of the 42 out of the 3400 films that I have ranked 10/10, and they are two of the most deserving, if not THE most deserving.",10,2,3,23 February 2015
Footloose," Probably deserves about a 4, but I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS!
","Remake a film... FINE. But don't copy every single aspect of the movie.And if you're going to - you better improve on it or you're going to get a review like this one.Every single aspect of the film is the same. I thought the remake of 'Arthur' borrowed a little TOO much, but this remake takes the cake. There wasn't one iota of new ideas in this entire movie.I can only imagine the lack of effort it took to bring this thing together. The acting was fine, the production values were fine too, but when you know every scene before it comes because IT IS the same - you just don't care anymore.From the scraping of his license under his chin, to the yellow bug(yes the door still sticks), to his friend 'Willard', to Ariel's dress in the final scene, to getting unfairly caught with a joint, to listening to quiet riot, to well, you get the point.I just don't SEE the point. Watch the original - it's mUCH, much better.You wanna know how to remake a movie... do what 'Shawshank' did for 'Escape From Alcatraz', or what 'The Departed' did for 'Infernal Affairs'... DON't Just copy the darn thing from beginning to end!This is the new Hollywood at a new, all-time low!ugh. I forced my wife to sit through this at my request, and now I have a pile of payback that sits a mile high... thanks a lot Footloose!34/100 Probably worth about 45/100 until you factor in the fact it just blatantly copied an entire movie scene for scene, nuance for nuance, dialog for dialog... Miles Teller is quite literally the only redeeming quality here.",3,2,3,14 May 2012
Get Him to the Greek," I wasn't necessarily disappointed, but this spin-off is average at best
","The film starts off funny and lays down some character development.P-Diddy was one of the highlights of the film with his 'do-whatever-it-takes' role as a record label exec/ceo. You can tell that this was familiar territory for the anal-retentive-superstar who truly does act like he is above everything else in true life.There are many funny moments in the first hour of this film, and most of those moments center around Aldous Snow(Russell Brand). From his ridiculous lyrics, to his falling-off the wagon, Snow really is the glue that keeps this together early. I was slightly disappointed in Jonah Hill's character. In Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Hill was completely convincing as an over-zealous Aldous Snow fan, but here his obsession with Snow and Infinite Sorrow is understated and under-developed. There could be an explanation for this. Aldous' latest album 'African Child' was an awful, critically bashed piece of junk that could turn away any music fan, but we still don't see the fanaticism from Hill that we expected coming out of 'Marshall'.There is a major flaw with this film.The relationship between Hill's character and his long-time girlfriend is shallow, and that shallowness really disintegrates the ending of the film. We're left to feel something for these two, and ultimately, Hill's character should have just kicked her to the curb.The last thirty minutes is painful to watch. The best thing about this film is the relationship between Hill and Brand. The film spends enough time showing us that their girlfriends are shallow and unlikable - so it makes no sense whatsoever when the film abandons the concentration on the friendship between Hill and Brand, in favor of rekindling the unlikable relationships with their girlfriends. We were having fun when they were single. We wanted to see Brand and Hill ride off into the sunset smoking a Jeffrey - instead we get back to what they both ran away from, terrible relationships with unlikable women.Serious but also meaningless spoiler alert!!!! When the end of the film shows us that Hill followed his shallow girlfriend to Seattle - it completely undermines the entire film. Awful ending!49/100You'll MIGHT like it if you liked: I Love You Man, Bachelor Party 2, Weekend at Bernies, and The Great Outdoors.",5,0,2,18 October 2010
Fast Five," A better option than many others in this genre.... EXTREMELY MILD spoilers
","Better than the A-Team. Better than the Expendables. Better than xXx, Pitch Black, Battle L.A., and better than any film I can remember that stars either a UFC guy, or a WWE/WWF guy.That isn't saying much, BUT this most recent 'Fast and the Furious' installment is loads of fun. Extremely predictable, extremely formulaic, but this film has great non-stop action, and while it's unbelievable, it's not as unbelievable as flying a tank through the air, or flying a bomber like a fighter jet....The ending is a little over-the-top, but at least there's a nice little twist(albeit somewhat predictable).Basically we have a film here that is exactly what you expect it to be - only it's so fast, so furious, and so well-done that it marginally escapes the normal verdicts.Really cool to see Vin Deisel and The ROck together, and you can tell that these two guys are a cut above the normal castings for these types of movies. They've been in the biz long enough to deliver their lines with emotion and confidence, and hold there own in every physical aspect.All that said; I probably won't watch it again. I wish I would have seen this on the big-screen though. It really is the definition of a big-budget(huge) popcorn-flick done right, but that also means that it's predictable, over-the-top, unbelievable, and not really my cup-of-tea...You should know where you stand going in, so if you decide to give this one a try, I know you'll like it.Best in the series.64/100You'll like it if you liked: Fast and the Furious, Independence Day, Armegeddon, The Rundown, or Drive Angry.",6,0,1,12 October 2011
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Characters come into their own. Story develops masterfully. Action-packed! Best Sequel? Heck, best movie?
","Han Solo and Luke Skywalker become the most famous space-frontiersmen of all-time.This is the penultimate moment in movie history. The answer to the question: Can a sequel be better than the original? Even Lucas' attempts to 'enhance' the film over a decade later would be futile. It was like trying to 'enhance' a classic song. You cannot improve upon it - you can only mess it up.The puppet Yoda would later give way to the CGI Yoda, but Yoda would never be as significant nor as powerful as he was in 'The Empire Strikes Back'.This film is basically three acts. Hoth. The Degoba System(sp?). Cloud City.The movie moves at a breakneck pace, and the film's action sequences have a degree a realism in the model-usage that still seems unrivaled with CGI.The film manages to be funny without being corny, action-packed without being unrealistic, and iconic without being clichÃ©.No film is perfect, but this is very close. It is hard for any avid movie fan to come up with a top ten, but this is unquestionably top 5 for me.I'm 38. Many films had an impact on my life. Blade Runner, Back to the Future, Star Wars, Empire, Platoon, SIxteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Ferris Buellers, E.T., CLose Encounters, Goonies, Raider's, Bond FIlms Etc, etc. This film IS my childhood. If bias means the best film from your childhood - then I'm bias.

The Cabin in the Woods," The definition of fantastic-concept/average-execution.
","I love the idea of this movie.Perhaps this material would have been better suited for Adam Green or Sam Raimi.It's very difficult to discuss this film without giving away plot-points, and I'm not going to do that.It had some comedic moments, which I enjoyed, but the film didn't come anywhere close to meeting my expectations.I watched a slightly average Aussy horror flick last night that was better than this, 'The Loved One's'(6/10), only without the hype. I can tell you that the idea of the film is a 10/10... where do you think the other aspects of this film sit for me to rank it 5.7/10?They barely tapped into a brilliant story, and seemed totally lost in how to finish this thing. The entire set-up of the main characters needs re-written and re-shot, and it really starts the movie off with a huge THUD. I think the ultimate explanation or 'purpose' of the storyline is a bit ridiculous, and could have been better explained away(as it so terribly was), or justified(another 'you'll have to see it' statement).This brilliant 'idea' will split audiences. Some will gush over the idea itself, but I believe the idea only takes a movie so far. Perhaps the films humor will eventually open my heart to give this film a re-watch, but not any time soon.Sorry I feel the need to say it,... this film is a little over-rated. Not a lot. A little. It isn't a terrible movie, but it also isn't a 7.3 movie either.. Perhaps my expectations here are affecting my score a little bit. BUT, I love the horror genre. I believe this falls into the very average horror category,.. near the likes of the 'My Bloody Valentine 3D' remake or 'Silent Hill', and not like the posthumously honored cult-classic that we were told it was upon release.57/100You'll like this if you liked: Cabin Fever(slightly better), Silent Hill(about even), Cube(slightly better), Zombieland(better), or Dylan Dog(worse).",6,1,3,29 September 2012
Joy," fizzles into a big pile of nothing down the stretch
","I don't know how else to explain it.Perhaps the problem here is the subject matter. There was another 'invention film' that wasn't great called 'Flash of Genius' with Greg Kinnear, and while that film also waned down the stretch, it was better than this one.Jennifer Lawrence is about the only redeeming quality here. Everything is just so unlikable or shallow about every other character in the film. 'Joy' is overrated here at 6.7, and is probably on the way to 6.4- land before long. I'd go 52/100. When our lead here finally get's rich, it comes off as a poorly explained and rushed conclusion. We sit for an hour-and-a-half waiting for a payoff, and what we get is a legal-boring-non-twist, and a brief explanation on what made her rich. Is that what we were meandering through all that average film for? Oh geeesh. The end is very anti-climatic. This film, along with 'Race', 'THe Brother's Grimsby', and 'Whiskey Tango Foxtrot', had me in movie purgatory for my two days off, making me wish I had actually gone to one decent movie at the theater, and not wasted 12-15 bucks on this lot of terribly average, if not flat-out disappointing films.The lone bright-spot was 'London Has Fallen'(6.5/10), which at the very least was an unabashed, yet still frenetically-fun rehash of the original. And no I don't have to have action to enjoy a film.There is very little 'Joy' to be found watching 'Joy'.",5,2,4,1 July 2016
Moon," Won't Be Everyone's Cup 'O Tea, but 'Moon' is a film lesson on making more with less.
","TOugh movie to review here.'Moon' is an atmospheric, moody piece about isolation.SOme here will certainly poke and prod at the plausibility of this film, and the lack of action, but 'Moon' is much more than that.One of the great things about this film is the music. This film has style. This film has tension. It also has one of the most under-rated actors in the biz, Sam Rockwell. From his role in 'Confessions of a Dangerous MInd', I've been following Sam like lost puppy, and he never seems to disappoint. He single handedly made Iron Man 2 a pretty good sequel, somehow made 'Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy' watchable, and stamps approval on just about everything he touches. Conviction, his latest, is very good.His performance here is nearing Oscar material.'Moon' defies the detractors with it's subtle but powerful storyline, and uses some fantastic editing, music, and acting to weave one of the better films of the year. Worth owning. Undoubtedly, some will call this boring, but many film masters will take notice of the care and effort that it took to piece together this fine work of art - because that's what it is.Other recommendations along similar lines(or you'll like it if you liked) : Solaris(orig/about even & remake/not as good), Outland, The Quiet Earth, Silent Running",9,3,9,11 November 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," This is a great movie.... here's the problem with the detractors.
","Contains MIld Spoilers.Reading through the negative reviews I couldn't help but feel regret that those more associated with Indian culture have turned on this film. I can say that, personally, I can't speak with any knowledge of the subject(Indian Culture and History). I can only say that I don't believe that racial stereotypes were the focus of the director(s) and nor should they be the focus of the viewers. And it is important to note the Boyle doesn't claim to be an expert on India and that he employed the services of many to help him with this vision.However!<, I can say that I have seen over 5,000 films from many different countries including many from India and to say that Slumdog Millionaire DOESN't belong with some of the quality Indian films would be unfair. As for quality(cinematography, music, acting, etc), you would be HARD pressed to find better films than this in India or in America.Fact is, there are poverty stricken people in both countries that could end up in similar circumstances.... and to criticize this film for racial discrimination would be selling this movie short.Slumdog Millionaire is EASILY one of the years best. The film follows the life and struggles of two brothers. One of the finest aspects of the film is how Boyle and Co. found a group of young actors to play the roles of the brothers throughout different segments of their lives. So many times this shows the weaknesses of one group of actors or another, but in Slumdog, they do an equally fine job in each segment.Another unwarranted criticism of Slumdog concerns the plausibility of the film. To say that this could never happen would be like saying that no one ever hits the lottery. Sure, the chips rarely fall into place, but it happens none-the-less. How many times have you watched 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' and just happened to know some of the huge dollar answers because of happenstance? It happens all the time. The smallest and least significant moments of our lives can be the most enlightening. You just never know when some piece of information you thought you'd never use will become useful.Jamal Malik perseveres because he's tough. He's been through so much that he's wiser.... smarter than he appears... an education outside of the realm of education. At one point in the film his rough childhood is the only reason he gets an answer right... It was a lesson about trust that he learned a long, long time ago. It marked one of many great moments in this film.Slumdog entertains from start to finish. At times it is hard to watch the violence towards the children in this film, but that violence is at the very center of the story. This is definitely not a children's film. The line from 'Shawshank Redemption' comes to mind... 'Andy Dufresne crawled through a mile of the most God awful smell and came out clean on the other side'.... That is Slumdog in a nutshell. I loved this movie. They make movies about poverty, violence against children, and religious upheaval in America and England too. Remember that before you try to tear this apart for casting a dark light on Indian culture. Slumdog Millionaire is a huge success and deserves all the accolades it has received and then some. 10/10 93/100(I ROUND UP ANY 93+ TO 10)",10,6,11,26 December 2008
Warm Bodies," about equal with 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Zombieland'
","These zombie-genre-benders have had a good run, and 'Warm Bodies' love story theme works about as well as I could have hoped.There are many 'explanations' that could have been better developed/explained, but some sharp casting, solid art direction, and fantastic music really pull this thing together to be one of the early, pleasant surprises for 2013.While I said that some things could have been better examined, and they could have, the lead character's journey comes off as completely genuine. The timeline for his 'transformation', and the 'heart' behind it are pitch-perfect.The humor is subtler than it could have been, but that actually fits the mood of the entire film.Theresa Palmer and Nic Holt have fantastic chemistry and bright futures.The film wouldn't work without all the early, well-written narration. And the more I think about - the lack of explanation may be there, but the story has the backbone to help the audience draw many of it's own conclusions.I don't want to raise expectations too high, but this might be about even with Shaun of the Dead, and perhaps a touch better than Zombieland(even though I rated all 3-7/10). IMO Zombieland starts out funnier than this but fizzles a bit late. Shaun of the Dead is funnier too, but for me that music(I'm buying this soundtrack) and the love story(which probably gives this more mass appeal) make 'Warm Bodies' as good or better.You might like this if you liked:duh..Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead, or Dear Beautiful(2009).73/100",7,2,4,5 June 2013
The Martian," strong.. very mild if any spoilers
","I had WIld Tales, Ex Machina, and Mississippi Grind at the top of the 2015 list until I hit the BigD the other night and caught this in 3D - which I usually don't care for but man o man it was sweet for this flick. LATE EDIT.. have since moved back to #4.Visually, the film absolutely knocks it out of the park. A colossal homerun. Damon is good in the lead, and the supporting cast is great too. UNlike Castaway, which I did enjoy thoroughly, the castaway segment of this film is quite eventful, funny, and paced evenly.. the film is a quick 2:20... for me I wish this was more like 3 hrs long because some of the subplots were jettison because of the running time.I suggest seeing it in 3D because the spaceship scenes are great in 3d as is the early 'storm' scene. I don't care for the format. I only saw it because the time suited my mother and I's schedule... by the way she absolutely loved the film too. SOmetimes it darkens the overall film and makes it a little more blurry for me, but not the case here. I enjoyed it.There's only one major problem with the film, and I say major because it stands out like a sore thumb even though I guess it shouldn't be that big of a deal... it's just an idea that was used in a late scene that seemed a little stupid(canopy). That idea and the fact they packed a 3hr movie into 2:20 are the only things keeping this from being a 10, and that's saying something.Ridley took the only good aspects of Prometheus(some of the visual aspects:suits, planet, etc), and only enhanced them here. The plot is the opposite(not rocket science pun intended). Martian may drive up the middle of the road, but the acting, script, and visuals are so good that it literally elevates the film to another level. Ridley is back with a bang.Very good film. Dunno if it will hold onto the top spot, after all I'm just 30 films into my 85 film watchlist for 2015, but I don't see any chance that it doesn't stay in the top 5 when all is said and done next spring. Highly recommend this. 88/100You might like this if you like:Castaway(about even or ever-so- slightly below), Hunter Prey(not as good - b-movie rec), Prometheus(not nearly as good), or Gravity(not quite as good as this but pretty close).cyaPS the reasons I late edited this down froM 9 TO 8 and from #1 for '15 to #4(FURTHER NOW WITH OTHER FLICKS MOVING AHEAD) was a rethinking about the cliché'd supporting roles, predictability, and the other small issues, but overall it's a very good film.... may go back up to 9 torn on this. 8.5!",8,3,6,20 October 2015
The Fighter," Great performance from Bale. This Could have been epic.
","Alright.The Fighter is a true story about Mickey Ward - my favorite boxer. I grew up around this time, and watched most of the fights featured in the film. I recently wrote a sports-blog(for 4 years) about a variety of sports; boxing, football, baseball, basketball, etc. On one particular occasion I wrote a blog about 'The Top 20 Sports Moments Since 2000'. Amongst them were Michael Phelps' Gold Medal barrage, Usain Bolts' 100 meter world-record, and the 2004 Red Sox winning Major League Baseball's 100th World Series, which ended the Curse of the Bambino. What was #1? What event/moment did I single as the greatest? Mickey Ward's first fight against Arturro Gatti.It was a fight that made movies like Rocky 3 marginally realistic. The brawl of brawls. The most violent, epic, unforgettable, irreplaceable, 'shake your hand on your buddies head'' moment of sports Godliness. It took boxing fans back to the pre-depression days of bare-knuckle fights and hard-men, and reminded us of the euphoric heights of heart and determination that can be captured in sport.Not even a strong performance from Christian Bale can make up for that sports' moment being left out of this screenplay. We can only hope that Aronofsky's drama/comedy will get non-boxing fans to look into the career of Mickey Ward - so that they might see that fight.Bale's performance is amazing, but I don't think that Mark Wahlberg really captured the role of Mickey in the same way. At least he didn't immerse himself into the character in the same way as Bale, and the biggest resemblance he had with Mickey was his physique.This was a very good movie; entertaining, fast-paced, with a brisk running time. 'The Fighter' isn't quite as good as its' current ranking here, but it should crack the years Ten Best, IMO. The boxing scenes are more realistic than most, and the interaction between Mickey's family and circle of friends is priceless.Good. Not great! Nudged out 'The Town' as the best movie I saw this week. If Wahlberg was on par with bale, and if this had gone another half-hour and included the Ward/Gatti fight, it might have scored as high as a 8-8.5.75/100Solid Recommendation.You'll like it if you like: Bull Durham, Without Limits, Conviction, and Rocky Balboa.",7,11,16,31 December 2010
