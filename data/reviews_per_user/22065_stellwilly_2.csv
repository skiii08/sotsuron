Sucker Punch," yuk
","Sure - Zack Snyder is entitled to get aroused by the idea of young girls getting battered, murdered, raped, forced into prostitution and lobotomized. Sure - he's entitled to dress up his sick fantasies in push up bras, hot pants, fishnets, stilettos, and false eyelashes. And sure, it's a free country, so Snyder can delude himself into thinking that his flimsy derivative script is deep. (Did he pay Nolan a license fee for the dream within a dream within a dream gimmick?) But please please please, someone make him stop spouting all that BS about female empowerment! He wouldn't understand female power if it kicked him in the ass. SuckerPunch falls only a few steps short of kiddie porn. How very sad that watching fantasy girls get brutalized is what appeals to the 'young male demographic' in the US, when so many flesh-and-blood women around the world are really and truly suffering all the crimes that seem to titillate Snyder and his ilk.",1,7,15,31 March 2011

","Is there a term for movies that egregiously rip off and badly recycle concepts that Phillip K. Dick nailed brilliantly half a century ago? Dick-lite? Cheap-Dick? Dick-on-a-stick? Does Michelle Moynahan have any other facial expression than that simpering little grin? Can't a fabulous actress like Vera Farmiga find better projects to showcase her talents? Is there an alternate universe in which you actually have to come up with a few original ideas in order to make a movie? Is there an alternative reality in which just being David Bowie's son is not enough to get a directing gig? (After the screening, in the elevator down to the garage, a couple had these insightful comments: Him: 'Yeah, I kinda liked it. It was really great to see Chicago on the screen.' Her: 'Yeah, Chicago is such a pretty city.' Him: 'Yeah, it looked beautiful.' When the best you can say about a supposed action-sci-fi-thriller is that the opening aerials were pretty -- you know it's in trouble. But hell, the masses will probably love it...)",4,10,21,30 March 2011
