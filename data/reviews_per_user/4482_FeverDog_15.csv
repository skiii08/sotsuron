Requiem for a Dream," Silent. *SPOILER*
","I can't even speak about it.  I've never been so stunned, paralyzed, speechless, creeped out, disturbed, affected, moved, horrified, buzzed, crazed, numbed, gutted, anguished, elated, ecstatic by a film.  I won't and I can't discuss this masterpiece right now; I need to break its grasp on me before I can even think normally. Experience it.  In Digital (for the doctor's office scene if nothing else. Coffee and eggs.  The fridge.  Needle.  Breath.  Pupil.)  Praise it.  Absorb it. Become one with the soundtrack.Accept it.Thank Artisan for not cutting it for an R rating.  The sex scene is absolutely essential.  This is addiction, and you can't just allude to the horror - it needs to be shown undiluted, uncut, viscerally, for real.  It does not glamourize drug use; who would wish to be one of these helpless souls?  You cannot look away, shut your eyes, be shielded - nor can the movie.  Some films are for adults only; this one is not for mass consumption.  Go.  Go now.  10/10",10,0,0,27 October 2000
The Rookie," A solid base hit up the middle.
","THE ROOKIE is what it is - well made but predictable. Some details were confusing (I thought Jim had two children, then a third one pops up unexpectedly) or incorrect (didn't Morris strike Clayton out looking?), but overall it was a pleasant, inoffensive movie. As a baseball fan, my favorite moment was the Devil Rays' defensive errors during The Big Game. Anybody who follows the sport would recognize the authenticity of this scene (jeez, that team has sucked for so long), and it was great to see familiar names (Boggs, Canceco) on the jerseys hanging in the locker room, as well as shots of the gorgeous Arlington ballpark, home of the Texas Rangers. But you know what would have been cool? Since the Durham Bulls make an appearance, why didn't Costner take this role?  It'd be a nice touch for the parents, and Costner's participation in this movie would have helped us forgive FOR LOVE OF THE GAME.With attractive actors and a well-assembled though predictable script, THE ROOKIE is a competent but unspectacular film.",Null,0,1,3 April 2003
Finding Nemo," Better than average animated film, but nothing great.
","I'm not much of a fan of these computer animated films.  I've seen them all, but have only liked ANTZ and MONSTERS INC.  But FINDING NEMO is a passable flick, mostly due to its stunningly gorgeous visuals.Wow, what a beautiful-looking movie.  I was especially impressed with the jellyfish scene; there was something dreamy about their look,  It's hard to explain, but they felt both real and unreal.I laughed several times, but I'm bored with praising the movie (Ellen was marvelous, blah, blah), so let me nitpick.  Well, not nitpick exactly - these are just thoughts I had while watching it:*Much of it seemed like a video game, where you survive a challenge and advance to the next world.  *Why did some characters have American accents, and others Australian ones? And how were their voices so clear in the water?  (You ever try talking under water?)  And how did their voices sometimes echo in the water?  And howcum their voices sounded the same both in and out of water?*Can fish adapt so easily from salt water to fresh and back again?*Do fish really sleep on their side?  Do they sleep at all?*A little surfer-dude speak goes a long way.  How would sea turtles acquire such a patois?  Do they spend a lot of time on the beach?  Or licking funny frogs?*Would a doctor give a fish with a visual defect to his daughter as a gift?*Why would a doctor (or anyone) write his business address on a pair of cheap goggles?  *There was one climax too many.  Did we really need one more perilous situation?  *What's with Pixar and bad kids with braces?I guess that's about all the questions I shouldn't ask.  None matter, do they?  7/10",7,1,2,11 February 2004
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," FUNNY ABOUT LOVE V2.0
","HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS threw out all credibility when it was revealed that Kate Hudson has a Masters from Columbia.  Granted, suspension of disbelief is required throughout the movie's interminable two hour running time, but, please, Hudson looks and acts way too young to make this believable.And the details of her job are both unethical and (to quote the script's recurring expletive) bullsh*t.  It's common knowledge that Cosmo articles about men are routinely written by men and are therefore predicated on a lie.  There's nothing stopping Kate from fudging the details in her piece or even making up the entire story.  She could have simply written one thing and done another, sparing the viewer the string of clich√©s that the movie hangs from.  We've seen other movies.  We know they're gonna find each other out, and break up, and miss each other, and one is gonna move away and be pursued by the other, and they're gonna kiss and make up, and the credits will roll.  Why the obvious takes so long to happen I don't know.  Two hours of this creepy story?  Agony.This is billed as a comedy, but the motivations of these two dullards stretch beyond credulity.  We're supposed to believe these two college-educated urbanites are so blind to the ways of the world that neither can intuit that something strange is going on between them.  That their oh-so-shocked reactions when the jig is up don't reek of hypocrisy. That two high-profile New York companies encourage petty bets for the benefit of their bottom lines.  That two yuppies-to-be are so cynical to go through with their bets but so idealistic to really fall in love after a week and a half of mind games.  Whatever.  Like the equally clueless and annoying couple in FUNNY ABOUT LOVE, perhaps these two dimwits belong together, if just to spare other New Yorkers their stunted mental capacities.There's only one scene that works:  The afternoon at Matthew's parent's home.  No lies, or psychotic behavior, or general stupidity.  (I could have done without the farting uncle, though.)  The screenwriters should have dumped all the crap before and after this scene and constructed an interesting courtship between these two and simply allow their relationship to develop with some semblance of reality.  Instead, we get dogs peeing on pool tables and a truly embarrassing singing duet with Marvin Hamlisch on piano.  (I wonder how Carly Simon felt when she realized how bad 'You're So Vain' was disgraced?)So, we have one believable scene between the two stars, and a couple nice shots of Matt's waxed chest.  And I enjoyed seeing Matt and Adam Goldberg together again after DAZED AND CONFUSED.  And I'm pleased that Lieutenant Dangle from 'Reno 911' is getting some big-screen work.  But that's about it for the plusses.Other things I questioned:  How did a low-level Cosmo girl score tickets to the NBA finals?  How does Matt get into Kate's office when she, in an earlier scene, had to swipe an ID card to enter the building?  And a cab pulls over to a construction site?  On a bridge?  In the middle of the day? And there's not a huge traffic jam?  And the cabbie is a native New Yorker? Who speaks clear English?  And a NYC rep house is running SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE and MYSTIC PIZZA?  Uh huh.So we've got a movie with only a tenuous connection to any known reality, featuring characters who are supposed to be smart but display little intelligence, in a script with numerous scenes cribbed from countless other movies.  And this latest example of Hollywood idiocy grossed over $100M. Go figure.  Why?  What American female can possibly relate to anything depicted in this movie?  I believe that SECRETARY, despite its kinkiness, is an infinitely more honest, funny, and revealing portrait of the modern mating dance.  Why audiences settle for such superficial chick flicks like this one, I don't understand.",3,1,2,23 April 2004
Insomnia," Isn't the original always better? *SPOILERS*
","What a disappointment!I'll keep this short:1. I never for a moment bought the idea of Robin Williams as a killer. He came off exactly as he was - a fallen star looking to regain street cred in an edgy thriller. Still, it was better than seeing him with a red rubber nose though.2. The Hollywood Influence. The Pacino character is completely softened from the original. Examples: A) The dog being shot is already dead. B) The killer, not the cop, plants false evidence in the boyfriend's home. C) The underage best friend hits on the cop, not the other way around. D) The desk clerk is not roughed up by the cop in abortive sex scene. God forbid America's protagonists have some unsavory qualities.3. The Hollywood Influence II: Must every movie be loaded with unnecessary profanity? I don't remember 'f---' being said dozens of times in the original; I also don't remember anyone complaining about the lack of cursing in the original.4. The Gratuitous Chase Scene. Yeah, the romp over the wet logs was a cool set piece in itself (although it reminded me of a similar sequence in STAKEOUT), but what exactly was the point of it? Williams escapes, only to agree to meet with Pacino later on the ferry. Why would he do this? To insert an unnecessary chase to sate America's need for action, I guess. This scene is neither included nor needed in the original - this is supposed to be a psychological thriller, not a conventional action flick.5. Instead of the main character having to live with himself after his amoral actions, this version has Pacino die at the end, alleviating the weight of his conscience.That's enough for now. Should I have compared the two movies so liberally? The '97 version (8/10) being shown on IFC before I headed out to the 'plex probably didn't help matters. But even if I had never seen the foreign version, I'd still would have had a strange sense of deja vu. Nolan's INSOMNIA cribs from SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (cop finding clues in dead girl's bedroom, unsuspecting heroine enters bad guy's home), SEVEN (knocking on bad guy's door at moment bad guy comes home that leads to a chase in murky dampness, after which bad guy calls cop at bad guy's home), and TV's TWIN PEAKS (in sleepy mill town girl is sleeping with boyfriend of now-dead best friend which is discovered by detective called in from big city).But if you're looking for some great footage of lush Alaskan wilderness, you've got cause to rejoice. The gorgeous cinematography here is the one aspect that surpasses the original. Props to Wally Pfister for all the evocative atmosphere he's created.OK, so this wasn't very short. Sorry.6/10",6,1,2,25 May 2002
Forrest Gump," In response to SpaniardInTheWorks (SPOILER)
","Just came across your words, and I couldn't have said it better myself. What's really insulting to me is the film's Republican wet dream worldview. Basically the message here is that if you keep your mouth shut and don't question authority, you will become a great man (if you're a free-spirited hippie, you'll die an early death alone). Of course Gump is a 'simpleton'; any complex opinions might likewise bring out similar thoughts in the audience, and we can't have that is a big shiny Hollywood movie. (Yeah, Gump tried to speak out in DC, but the microphone went screwy...silenced by THE MAN! :) )  And what's with the ending? Let's see, AIDS, death, marriage, another death - all in twenty minutes.  Jeez, it's shameless.
NO WAY this is better than Shawshank! Morgan Freeman's performance both breaks my heart and fills me with hope (pretty much what Hanks tried and failed to do - and he won the friggin' Oscar).  And Pulp Fiction changed audience's and Hollywood's perception of what a film can be, something that Gump didn't even attempt. It sucks. IT SUCKS. Still, always great to see Sally Field...",5,17,36,6 August 2000
Fargo," The pilot lives on Trio.
","Since there's no IMDb listing for the 'Fargo' television spinoff that never made it to air, I'm placing my comments for it here.The Trio network's 'Brilliant But Cancelled' series is hosting all sorts of interesting pilots, including some odd but intriguing shows like one with Adam West called 'Lookwell' and this dramedy that follows the still-pregnant Marge Gunderson, now played by, off all people, Edie Falco.  I don't know what network turned down this series (it had a CBS vibe), but, based on the one episode produced, I'd say it had a lot of potential.The pilot follows Marge as she investigates three crimes in small-town Brainerd:  a rather bloody murder whose evidence consists of home-made shell casings and size-8 footprints in the snow; a stolen boat and possible insurance scam; and a missing, frozen corpse.  The latter two turn out to be connected, as the son of the dead guy stole his father's body in order to give him a Viking funeral, which apparently requires the body to be burned on a lake in a wooden boat.  The murder investigation seemed underdeveloped, but I missed five minutes of the hour-long show while making dinner so maybe not.  The show ends with Marge giving birth in an abandoned building with Deputy Lou at her side with husband Norm looking in through a window.  (Lou is the same actor as in the movie, but Norm is played by That Guy from IN THE COMPANY OF MEN.  No, not Aaron Eckhart - the other one.)'Fargo' the Pilot wasn't great, but how many first episodes are?  (Look at how dull 'The Seinfeld Chronicles' is.)  The same beautiful music score used in the movie is here, and the show captured the same darkly comedic tone as the Coen Bros. Oscar-recipient.  Falco's Marge was nearly identical to Frances McDormand's (she didn't seem as intuitive, though) , and the folksy accents and charm were abundant.  I even spotted someone that should be a bigger star, and maybe would be if this show was picked up.  He was sort of an Anthony LaPaglia lookalike who played the younger brother of the guy who stole his dad's body.  His first scene is of him learning of his father's death, and his near-silent interpretation of the tumult of emotions inside him was heartbreakingly precise and real.  I couldn't take my eyes off him.  Who is this guy? Unfortunately, Trio didn't air the closing credits of the show, so his identity remains in limbo.  His character may not have been a regular on the show, but surely he'd move on to bigger things had the pilot been aired.  A shame.",10,0,0,3 September 2003
American Pie," No classic... (SPOILERS)
","Yeah, it's got an attractive, charismatic cast and some good laughs, but too many scenes just waste away with no punchline.  Although I'll admit the flute comment had me rolling on the floor for a good twenty minutes, and Eugene Levy is wonderful.  And the webcam scene is so sexist, but still pretty hysterical.  But its portrayal of horny teens and the loss of virginity has none of the dark, ultra-realistic complexity of Fast Times, which proves this subject matter can be both funny and honest.  American Pie doesn't even try, which I guess is okay to most teens, since this made a load at the box office. Oh well, maybe I'm just getting old...5/10",5,1,1,26 July 2000
Armageddon," Yeah, but are you gettin' it? Armageddon it! Ooh, really gettin' it? - Yes, Armageddon it! C'mon, Steve, get it!
","Why am I bothering with this movie now?  Michael Bay's BAD BOYS II is opening soon, so maybe my Summer Movies 2003 depression will lift if I do a little venting. (You know times are dire when the top three movies are all sequels that no one was really clamoring for.  I mean, who asked for another TERMINATOR, LEGALLY BLONDE, and CHARLIE'S ANGELS?  Tell me.  I really want to know.)I got a laugh when I read the pro-ARMAGEDDON user comments here, especially those which wonder why people hate this movie.  Can't you people read? The level-headed comments deriding this movie clearly  state why this movie is so awful.  The ridiculous plot.  The cruddy visuals.  The crummy acting. The jackhammer editing.  Good God, that Aerosmith song.  In short, the unrelenting bombast of it all is what we object to.  What don't y'all understand?Then there are those who give the movie's many faults a pass, believing that it's just supposed to entertain.  'Check your brain and you'll like it.' Everyone who enjoys this movie by successfully removing their brains must have encephala minuscule enough to fit in that jean mini-pocket that won't hold much more than a subway token and a dime bag.  Assuming you have the requisite amount of matter in your cranium that can be distressed, how can this movie not give you a headache?  It's loud, moronic, and insufferably long, and the A.D.D. editing just makes the ordeal that much harder to tolerate.Another reason I looked up ARMAGEDDON was to see why and how a movie nobody seems to like made over $200M at the box office.  It's dismaying to discover that people who think highly of this movie really exist.  I wonder if they can actually feel their brains rotting as the movie drags on and on.May I recommend LAST NIGHT if you dig end-of-the-world stories? Or a lava lamp if light and motion are what you crave?  In the mood for a Bruce Willis action flick but tired of the DIE HARD trilogy?  THE LAST BOY SCOUT is refined, Oscar-caliber cinema compared to this interminable assault on the senses.",4,1,2,10 July 2003
Face_Off," Excellent up until... (SPOILER)

American History X," Terrific at first, but something's not right... (SPOILER)
","I finally saw this again on cable this week.  When I first saw this in theatres, I of course was totally blown away. It was stunningly acted, beautifully shot, and, for the subject matter, very restrained, objective, and nonexploitive (the score was a little overbearing, though).  All these aspects remain in my second viewing, but the ending seems to negate everything that precedes it.  Throughout the film the story is Derek's hatred and his subsequent enlightenment and how Daniel is headed down the same destructive path.  We're led to believe that Daniel, by being made to write about his brother, will realize the error of his ways and change his outlook while he's still young and impressionable to do so.
So if this is the point of the story, why do the filmmakers have Daniel murdered in his high school bathroom by some kid that got in his face? Obviously, since he's dead, everything that he just learned the night before means absolutely nothing.  Are the filmmakers saying that it was already too late to help Daniel?  Why give more pain to Derek and his family in Daniel's brutal, practically random slaying?  Derek's already learned what he needed to.  Or did the filmmakers just want one more final shocker to tidy up the movie. Why not have him live, and the audience walk out hoping, praying, that he becomes a better man? (Same problem in American Beauty.)
(And what are the odds that a high school bathroom would be completely empty right before class starts? Just wonderin'...)I am in no way trashing this film. We can add another 90's Oscar theft to the list [Morgan Freeman, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, Martin Scorsese, PT Anderson (I could go on), and now Mr. Norton]. And it's always great to see Beverly D'Angelo.  But when I discovered American History X in IMDb's top 100, I had to speak up. 7/10",7,1,2,6 August 2000
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," My latest obsession.
","I'm not about to spoil the pleasures of this magnificent experience by reciting the plot, so all I'll say is that Hedwig and the Angry Inch explores themes of retribution, gender identity, and finding love within oneself.Some have compared it to The Rocky Horror Picture Show - unfairly, since when that cult musical is seen outside the craziness surrounding it, it's a pretty mediocre movie.  HATAI does share RHPS's flair for rock excess and roots in cult theatre, so if you've ever gotten a kick out of RHPS, prepare yourself for treat.  (If not, please seek therapy, or Rush Hour 2 at your local Blockbuster.)HATAI is based on the Off-Broadway musical by John Cameron Mitchell, who triumphs here in his lead cinematic debut (for which he's been deservingly nominated for a Golden Globe) while also directing and co-scripting.  The movie, simply, is a knockout, filled with fabulous eye candy and kickass musical numbers; it bursts with a visual and aural splendor that mainstream Hollywood rarely attempts.  Its structure is a marvelous blend of live rock performances, flashbacks, singalongs, animation, humor and drama. Seamlessly edited, it's easy (and delightful!) to follow the storyline despite all the changes in timeframe, style, tempo and emotion.I could go on and on about Hedwig and the Angry Inch without revealing one bit of plot, but I think you get the picture.  It's nothing like Almost Famous (my favorite film of 2000), but what they do have in common is what neither feature:  Violence, explosions, guns, hatred, immorality, heartlessness, nihilism, apathy.  While I don't believe it's appropriate for children, bright teenagers will find nothing objectionable; its R rating is due to its mature themes, (infrequent) profanity, and brief nudity.Go rent it.  (Better yet, purchase the DVD for its abundant special features, one of which clarifies the relationship between two of the characters.)  C'mon, aren't you dying to find out what the 'angry inch' refers to?FeverDog420",10,0,2,30 December 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Jeez, where do I start??? (SPOILERS)
","Ok, so I just finally saw Eyes Wide Shut last night during Cinemax's Kubrick-fest, and I've so so many issues with it:Let's talk up the good first.  Nicole's stoned confession that kicks off Tom's torment is a stellar display of acting chops. Absolutely mesmerizing. I've been a vocal defendant of her underappreciated talent ever since Dead Calm, and her performance here confirms my beliefs even more after Malice and My Life. (Too bad that after this scene she pretty much gets tossed aside in Tom's journey.)Great lighting! The blue hues and Christmas lights really lend themselves to Kubrick's icy filmmaking style. And the golden lustre at the party in the beginning made even Sidney Pollack look gorgeous. (Even though his home is roughly the size of Radio City...)Ok, now the not-so-good. (Wait!  Let me collect all my thoughts here...) Let's start with Tom's performance.  While the wife thrives on all the well-publicized endless takes, Tom seems too studied and mannered to display any complex torment; this may have to do with screenplay itself, since he never actually acts on his adulterous impulses (with the hooker in the Village, at the Big Scene - which I'll get to later). He just looks too tired all the time. He's a truly expert actor (see The Color of Money, Jerry Maguire & Magnolia), but a Kubrick film is obviously not his forte.There's the sets too. Kubrick of course tried to recreate downtown New York accurately, right down to every newsstand and Village Voice box, but, as a New Yorker, to me every street scene looks unbelievably fake; they're too clean and underpopulated.  They look like sets out of Sesame Street.  And where exactly on Long Island does that castle-of-sin exist? (Maybe out by the Hamptons, I don't know, but to take a cab there from Manhattan would cost a hell of a lot more than $75, and no way could he get out there, see what he sees, and be back by 4 am.)Now, about the film's dramatic centerpiece:  What exactly is that orgy scene?  No information is supplied about it - not by the piano player or Pollack.  Is is purely sexual decadence?  Are there religious significances? (Everyone is dressed like Benedictine Monk performance artists.)  And, if I understood it correctly, how did the junkie recognize Cruise?  They're both wearing masks, and if that was Pollack on the balcony nodding to Tom, how did HE know that that was Tom?  And if Tom had a vehicle of his own, why the hell did he take a cab out there?And there's all these scenes that have no relevance or connection to the main story. What's with those guys shouting homophobic taunts at Tom?  On what basis would they think that he was gay?  Is it because he's walking around late at night downtown?  (I've sucked face with another guy on the corner of St. Mark's and 2nd without so much as a glance from others.) Then there's the segments in the costume shop - what was that all that?  First, the shopkeeper's daughter is found with those two Asian guys and the keeper's gonna call the cops, but later the two guys are there again? What is the connection? What does it mean?  My roommate thought that the daughter was one of the models hitting on Tom at the party, but the daughter (Leelee Sobieski, whom I recognized from Deep Impact and Never Been Kissed) was definitely not one of those chicks.  ???  And the sojourn with the hooker who, as learned later, is HIV positive?  Call me naive, but I know of no NYC prostitute who brings a prospective client back to her apartment to woo and romance him.  And what was with the scene in the motel lobby with Alan Cumming?  God, I adore Mr. Cumming (B'Way's Cabaret), but his performance is totally out of whack with everyone else's.  And the information he supplied - that Nick Nightingale (the pianist seemed 'scared' with two big, beefy guys).  Was Nick really returned to Seattle to his wife and kids?  He had bruises on his face.  What really happened to him?I realize that I may be nitpicking, but is just a little plausibility too much to ask for?  Maybe there's more going on here than cheap beer can provide access to. [I was on my fifth Coors Light when the film started; hey, Full Metal Jacket was on before this, and the first half of that film never ceases to creep me out, although at 9:00 (after the 'me so horny' scene) I switched over to Sex & the City on HBO (Carrie's getting back with Big, and Samantha has issues with 'funky spunk') - how can anyone resist?].Anyway, back to EWS...I am totally disgusted with the MPAA's verdict, that we immature Amercans cannot view a few glimpes of arty sex, and must be protected with some digital trickery and censorship - if you've seen EWS, you know what I'm talking about (this reminds me of American Psycho, where not the brutal violence is taboo, but a menage a trois is just too must for our eyes.  But this is a whole other issue...).  I've never really been a Kubrick fan; I find The Shining to be nothing more than Jack being Jack (although I'm all about Stephen King, and it's always swell to see Shelley Duvall). A Clockwork Orange has an unrelenting artifice that I cannot get past. I haven't seen 2001, since sci-fi turns me off quicker than skinny boys from Chelsea (I didn't see Star Wars until it was rereleased a few years ago, as well as Empire, although I still haven't seen Jedi. And I HATE The Matrix, but that's yet another story).In response to that guy who stated that if one doesn't understand Eyes Wide Shut, then one is lacking intellect or something like that.  I realize that I am not an articulate man. I have intelligent thoughts about films that I cannot express in words. It does not equate me with stupidity, naivete, or undereducation. I know an amazing screenplay when I'm fortunate enough to witness it (Boogie Nights, Raising Arizona, The Sweet Hereafter, Breaking the Waves), although for some reason I cannot quite accurately comment on why it's so amazing. There's lots of us out here without the capacity of insight or intellect to have valid, 'professional' input on this film. Give us plebes a little credit.  Usually, when a film by a legend is incoherent, amateurish (don't get me started on the raw piano score here, which any three year old protoge can improve on), and suffering from a lack of cohesive structure, the 'intellects' attempt to input their overanalizations onto a project that doesn't (shouldn't!) warrant it (see Lost Highway). Think about it: if anyone but Mr. Kubrick made this film, would y'all be so quick to heap praise?Don't get me wrong.  I respect Mr. Kubrick's work, his place in cinematic history.  But as I've never 'gotten' his work, I must speak. Eyes Wide Shut starts off fabulously, but eventually devolves into Kubrick's own two-steps-behind psyche. This film is not remotely scandalous, coherent, relevant, sexy, sensual, or even important today.  He was holed up in his hermetic little world for too long, and didn't realize that his themes (infidelity, sexual obsession, death, and repentance) have been cataloged in numerous cheesy made-for-late-nite-cable 'erotic thrillers'.  It's HIS eyes that are shut.Lordy Lord, how can I impose a grade on this film?  I really don't know what to ultimately make of it.  When it ended, I had a pretty thorough discussion of it with the roommie, and any film that can make me talk about it for over thirty minutes deserves some kudos [see Chuck & Buck (please!), Lost Highway, again].  So obviously I cannot totally write Eyes Wide Shut off as a 'bad' film.So I guess that my verdict is that we all should view Eyes Wide Shut (at least) once, just to get an opinion.  Most movies do not allow such intense debate.  In this aspect, EWS is definitely worthy.  I just don't see the reason for any deeper discussion.  I don't know - maybe I just read my EW a little to fervently...",Null,0,1,7 August 2000
Ice Age," THREE MAMMALS AND A BABY? Exactly.
","I didn't think much ICE AGE. Never mind the drab visual look or the predictable plot.  What annoyed me was its unrealized premise.I dunno, but why do these animals need to speak? Disregard, as I have, the fact that English wasn't around when the movie was set. What bothered me was the laziness of the scriptwriters. Wouldn't the movie be more creative if the animals didn't speak at all? How about telling the story through their own means - with body language and grunts and whatnot. What's the point in making a movie about animals if all you're gonna do is supply them with recognizable human characteristics? Sure, it'd be terribly difficult to make this movie without dialogue, but it'd be possible right? Think of all the money to be saved without hiring B-list actors to supply the voices.This would also eliminate another gripe I had - the anachronistic dialogue. At one point Manfred spoke of a 'petting zoo.' Would zoos have been in existence at the time the movie takes place, much less the petting variety? Another quip had to do with a slalom; I don't believe any form of sport exist back then, especially not a sophisticated zigzag skiing type. 
I guess I'm too hard on these kiddie movies. I still haven't figured out exactly what Stuart Little is (a mouse, or a boy who looks like a mouse? And why doesn't his family treat him as such? Are they blind, or just stupid?), so maybe I should stop watching them.",5,3,6,8 October 2003
Any Given Sunday," I eventually do discuss AGS here - it's a long journey, but a scenic one...
","So I took another giant leap in my ongoing quest in becoming a sports fan. Tonight I was riveted by the second Yankee upset to the rallying Detroit. Then I watched the complete postgame program, including all that happened in baseball tonight.  Then I watched the midnight, edited rerun while flipping to the repeated Mets game.  Ain't that something for me to be proud of?I now know the complete Yankee starting defensive lineup, if not yet batting order (I'm working on that one).  Ok, I don't know all the pitchers yet. But I haven't known this much since growing up with the 80's Phillies.  I also know who's on the DL and why, and how it affects the team, and who's in a slump and who's on fire.Man, who knew Detroit was this much a match?  I hadn't ever heard anything about them until this series.  They've earned my respect, and have established themselves in my eyes as a viable force.  I also now know details of their park and their players.And talk about rallies.  The Mets have a four game winning streak, their best of the season.  But, as a former Philadelphia native - go Phillies!  A two-game division lead!  Put that in your crock pot and simmer it, Atlanta!!This brings me thoughts of why football never held any allure for me. Because the Eagles play each team only once or twice in regular season, they don't allow me to properly size up the opposition.  I hardly know any of the other quarterbacks in the sport (and none of the other positions), or the idiosyncrasies of the stadiums, if they exist.  If this compacted, accelerated schedule applied to baseball, I would never have had the opportunity to recognize Detroit's strengths or know much about any non-Yankee players.Anyway, so after the high of a Yankee game, I was really itching for a movie that took an insider's look at professional baseball.  But I couldn't think of one that fully explores this angle.  Bull Durham is set in the minors and focuses on the superstition aspects of the game as well as specific fictional characters.  The Natural and Field of Dreams focus on baseball's romantic allure and its idealistic nature as America's Favorite Pastime. Major League is played broadly for laughs.  The Babe is simply awful.  For Love of the Game could have been good had it focused more on Costner's mind (and the team's reaction) while pitching a perfect game, and less on syrupy, groan-inducing, clich√©d, generic romantic turmoil in the pitcher's private life.  So what are we left with?Then, lo and behold, Any Given Sunday pops up on HBO.  THIS is what I'm talking about!  What I was looking for was a baseball version along these lines.  The inevitable collision of a rookie's ego, inexperience, talent, and stupidity.  The relationship of the team, coaches, and reporters. Yeah, parts of the movie are, well, 'movie-ish' (do real players recite brief monologues, trade insults, and incite a shoving match while in a huddle? I've never seen it.)  But Oliver Stone is a masterful director who gives all his films an immediate, urgent feel with creative editing and topnotch production values, even though sometimes he feels the need for his characters to shout at the top of their lungs too much to complete the effect;  he's never been known for subtlety.Any Given Sunday stimulated my mind to wander a bit, and I reflected on the similarities of Dennis Quaid's characters here and in Everybody's All American - a legendary quarterback past his prime who's trying to retain his dignity and stature in the sport.  And, poof!  I flip to Showtime, and there's Everybody's All American.  God must have had His cable modem plugged into my head tonight.  This happened earlier in the day too.  Poetic Justice, featuring Regina King, was on Cinemax.  Ms. King was also in Jerry Maguire, which led me to Tom Cruise and thoughts on the era in his career as a rising star - the 80's.  And of course one can't think of said era without reflecting on his financially successful misfire known as Cocktail.  Sure enough, Cocktail also made an appearance on television tonight.  Too bad God logged off when I wished for a Yankee victory this evening.Anyway, back to AGS.  How clueless is Elizabeth Berkeley's manager?  We all know the story of Showgirls.  She tried to break out of her wholesome TV image in an daring, adult role.  She failed, with a wooden performance (and she wasn't helped by the impossible dialogue and ridiculous character), and garnered scathing reviews.  On the flip side, Gina Gershon made the most out of her character and was rewarded with a integral role in Face/Off and a lead in Bound.  A successful example of the transition Berkeley attempted is Lisa Bonet, who broke free of her Cosby persona in an equally controversial, bod-baring performance in Angel Heart.  Bonet's role was supporting, so perhaps Berkeley felt, when she accepted the lead Showgirls role, that by baring so much skin in a notorious movie, she'd be catapulted to stardom like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct.  Lizzy, honey, you ain't no Sharon Stone;  you possess neither solid acting ability nor star power.  Neither does, say, Ashley Judd, but she obviously has a established, influential agent/manager to overcome these obstacles.  This is also why Cameron Diaz became a headliner within a couple of years after The Mask.  Diaz does have star power, which helps, too; Judd took a lot longer to get where she is after her debut in 1993's Ruby in Paradise, and still can't headline a movie; Tommy Lee Jones and an intriguing (but deeply flawed) premise contributed to the commercial success of Double Jeopardy.So, after the failure of Showgirls, what does Berkeley do?  Bares her boobs again, but this time in an inconsequential bit role.  Granted, she's romantically partnered with Al Pacino, but, unlike Diaz, her character is not connected with the central plotline and can be easily eliminated.  This is not the way to rise to the top in Hollywood - from a lead to a bit player, trying to make her breasts her ticket to stardom.  Stupid girl.
Another point about AGS is that I admired its attention to the corporatization (is that a word?) of pro ball, from the superstars' endorsement deals and vanity projects (like cutting an inane, ego-inflating rap album) to the trend of naming ballparks the likes of Coors Stadium, Staples Center, and First Union Center.  This view is expressed in a scene with Pacino and Jim Brown, where Brown recalls a time when players didn't have their eye on the riches and were thrilled to merely be a part of the tradition and prestige of the sport, which leads Pacino to lament the advent, ubiquity, and hype of modern sports broadcasting as the culprit of the misguided values of today's younger stars.  This is why I'm anti-corporate:  'Teams' are now known as 'franchises.'  Stadiums are no longer named to honor legendary figures or a location.  Fenway.  Ebbetts. The Vet, Camden Yards and Madison Square Garden.  All these names evoke a sense of history.  Hell, there was even a Mr. Shea who was granted eternal props.Jeez, I wish I could build a career on all this:  personal ruminations based in film comparison and analysis.  Oh well, that's why God created IMDb at least.  I hope I haven't breached the thousand word limit.  As for Any Given Sunday:  I have seen it all the way through, but didn't tonight.  I do recall Jamie Foxx's breakthrough performance, and, during a beach scene with babes in bikinis, how and why movies stars today have bodies like Diaz and not, say, Marilyn Monroe (bless you, Kate Winslet).  And, viewed on television, how better the film must look in widescreen.  And how quickly the running time goes by (unlike the draggy Nixon).  And how Stone somewhat reigned in his trademark bombast towards a point of self-parody (it's an artistic step back) to deliver a mainstream hit.7/10",7,1,2,21 June 2001
