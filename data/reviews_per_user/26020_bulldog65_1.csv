Scarface," An average action flick
","OK, I like action movies as much as the next guy, but Scarface isn't worthy of the greatness people see of it. For 1, I have NEVER overly liked Pacino, he overacts in most of his movies (espically after the early 90's.) Also, this movie is just soooo over the top. With people being shot dozens of times, still standing and barely flinching. Or how about Pacinos character taking a nosedive into a pile of coke that could most likely kill a good sized elephant? This movie is good, but i don't believe it is worth all the hype. It is NOT up there with godfather, casino, untouchables, or any of the other classic gangster movies. This is a good Saturday night popcorn action flick, but it isn't worth all the 10 star votes its getting.",7,1,3,22 July 2005
