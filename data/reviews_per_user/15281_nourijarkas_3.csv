Ford v Ferrari," Wow
","It's been long time since I enjoyed a movie like I enjoyed watching this movie,",9,3,4,4 December 2019
The Irishman," Too old to act as young
","Good movie, good story with great actors. However, the old actors struggled to play the much younger versions of their characters specially Robert De Nero as his body posture and slow movement didn't convince he is a young tough gangster, the CGI helped make them look younger but it also reduced their face impressions, also De Nero didn't look Irish at all even with the blue eyes and I had to remind myself many times that he is Irish not Italian.",7,1,5,21 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Not Smart Enough
","The movie is entertaining, well directed with amazing CGI. However, for me the story was not smart enough to impress, there were too many situations solved easily like a fairy tale, and too much of superpowers which made me feel like watching an X-Men movie.",7,2,4,21 December 2019
