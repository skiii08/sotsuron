Ford v Ferrari," A Experience that makes me want to know more about cars.
","Seeing this movie in the cinema is another thing, in the racing parts it is as if we were driving. Christian Bale makes an excellent performance, for me deserving of Oscar nomination, Matt Damon and Jon Bernthal perform as always, as the rest of the actors. Briefly one of the best movies of 2019, we highly recommend watching at the cinema.",9,2,2,11 January 2020
Knives Out," Agatha Christie's inspiration
","Honestly the movie wasn't that hard to predict but still, it's a great movie, it's super fun, it has comedy, it has tense moments, great performances especially from Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas that I think that deserves a nomination to Best supporting actress, in short there is a mix of factors that make this movie one of the best of 2019, I don't know if it will get a Best Picture nomination, but in my opinion it deserves it.",9,2,5,11 January 2020
The Hateful Eight," Better than I thought
","Tarantino is one of the best directors ever and only he is able to make a film almost entirely in a cabin and yet all the scenes have a tension and joke and it is so difficult to predict what will happen next. However the film is slow and honestly there were scenes in which I had a bit of a hard time keeping up, but from the moment the it starts to happen, the film is so much more fun that there are scenes where I started laughing of stupidity and blood, as well as other aspects such as Photography and Music in the film are phenomenal, as are the performances mainly by Samuel L Jackson, Jennifer Lason Leigh and Walton Goggins.",9,0,2,25 February 2020
1917," Maybe the best one of the year. Best Picture Incoming.
","2019 was one of the best years for cinema I have ever seen and 1917 is one of the best of the year, if not the best, it deserves all the praise that is having, due to several factors, if possible watch it on IMAX, the experience is completely unforgettable, there are scenes in that we are in the skin of the characters and the cinematography of Roger Deadkins makes all the difference, Oscar for sure in this category, there are some emotional scenes where the music is magnificent and the performances of both main actors, mainly George Mackay. In other words, a cinematic masterpiece.",10,7,14,25 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," What a Film, Uau...
","Taika Waititi deserves nomination for best director and best supporting actor, all actors, but I repeat ALL actors give excellent performance, the kid did the best performance I've ever seen from a boy his age, the girl has a great future in Hollywood and Scarlett Johanson is showing us more and more that she is more than a Blockbuster actress and in my opinion deserves to win this year Oscar for best lead actress. Being honest, it was one of the few films that made me feel so empathetic with the supporting characters, it's tragic but hilarious at the same time. Without doubt one of the best this year. 10/10",10,4,11,26 December 2019
