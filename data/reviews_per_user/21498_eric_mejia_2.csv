Come and See," A picture for all seasons!
","'Come and See', the title of the Elem Klimov's brilliant psychological horror war picture can be definitely noted as a precursor for many of today's epic war pictures. The combination, of sight and especially sound, can bring one to feel as if they were living in war torn Belarus. The image of patriotism and the disillusionment is one to be taken home with, and thoughts are left to question acts of war and conquest. In today's day and age, with the recent speak of North Korea casing nuclear weapons, many are left to question whether it is freedom we long for, or warfare. 'Come and See,' tells the story of a Russian boy, Floyra, who is prepared to confront the Nazis and become what he has dreamed of, a heroic patriot for his country. But soon does this innocent youth discover is that war is no petty game of guns and bullets, but a world of gruesome imagery, violence, death, loss of innocence, torment and ultimately hate for other another people. The world Floyra discovers is a world of loss, betrayal, hunger, thirst and the encounters with men and women who gain selfish freedom by the death and murders of other innocent families. A key moment in 'Come and see' is the scene in the forest where he discovers Glasha, another girl who was left behind by the army. Upon meeting her in a morbid state, German airplanes attack their port and they run for cover and escape. Elem Klimov directs this scene with wonder in that you come to hear the perspective of Floyra, who has gone deaf as the bombs come under fire. There is nothing but a mere haunting mumble of noises with voices that sound stretched out and yawning. Elem Klimov shows his mastery to not only interweave good imagery, but great sound so that it's screeches stay with you, breath by breath. Quite possibly one of the most horrific adaptations of the Nazi War era crimes, Come and See does exactly what its title states, 'Come and See' a life so diseased by the acts of war.",10,1,1,19 June 2009
The Battle of Algiers," A foreign masterpiece unlike any other!
","Gillo Pontecorvos portrayal of the Algerian war against the French paratroopers carefully studies conflict of war and how violence, through escalation, only brings sorrow to those surrounding communities. Pontecorvo's and Franco Salinas' screenplay is very well articulated with memorable quotes and a dramatic structure which that continue to keep the picture tense yet emotionally intriguing. Both Pontecorvo and Salinas chose an interaction of characters from both sides of the war to feel passionate about their stance, thus leaving the picture to sympathize for both peoples, the FLN and the French civilians. Through the deaths of innocents, violence begins to escalate from the beginning, all the way to an explosive ending. Though no protagonist took the film by storm, Pontecorvo weaved a film where all the characters were equally felt for. His structure feels like a race of increasing violent acts, beginning with small gun battles and moving into the direction of time-bombs as acts of terrorism and revenge came soaring. Ennio Morricone's score couldn't help the picture anymore than make it an emotional driven roller-coaster, providing a tear or two in the process. When tension could be felt, Morricone exploded the scene with what sounds like a score of haunting rattling noises that get louder and louder. And finally, when tragedy strikes, like the scene when the Algerians begin looking for their loved ones in the bombs ruffle, Morricone goes into a haunting notion of a score driving one to feel sympathy for the Algerians. Overall, The Battle of Algiers is a foreign right masterpiece telling the horrors of terrorism, without creating a protagonist to sympathize for. It does for what real war does, incorporate a viewpoint from both sides and showcase the peoples pride each side has. It is a haunting story about sacrifices, pride and justice all told to portray freedom as something not so free.",9,0,1,16 December 2008
