The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Best one out of the 4!!
","So, I was fortunate enough to receive 4 tickets to The Twilight Saga's Breaking Dawn Part One last night. One word; AMAZING. This film is probably one of the best out of the four. Very different and funny! Billy Burke, who plays Bella's dad, Charlie has some funny lines by making fun of his ex-wife, Renee. Before I go on , I will be exposing *SPOILERS* in this review. But, not many because I do want you to spend your money and go see this movie. Haha. So anyways, there is a wedding; SO BEAUTIFUL,and a pregnancy; Warning: sort of gruesome since it's a vampire fang C-section. Again, I don't want to spoil it for any of you so I won't go on. But, in the end this movie is absolutely FANTASTIC!! If you haven't seen the other movies, then don't even bother because you will be confused the whole movie. Overall, I give this movie a 10/10 stars.",10,32,69,17 November 2011
