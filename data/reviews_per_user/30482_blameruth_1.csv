The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Love!
","Mockingjay Part 1 is probably my favourite Hunger Games film. District 13 seems like such a cool place, its exactly how I imagined it when I read the books. Jennifer Lawrence has improved so much as an actress throughout the films, and this film has made me so excited for Mockingjay Part 2. The scene when they fly in to rescue Peeta and the other tributes makes my heart race every single time I watch the film; even though I know what happens it never fails to draw a physical reaction out of me... I get goosebumps all over and as I said my heart beats like I've run a marathon! Very few films spark this sort of reaction in me, so I'm super impressed.",8,0,7,19 April 2015
