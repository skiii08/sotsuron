10 Cloverfield Lane," Best film for a long time...
","I don't give halves or quarters etc, but if I did, I would give this 9 1/2.I thought the film was going one way, then that changed as it progressed. Then back again, keeping me in suspense all the way through. It was proper 'edge of seat' at times. I went with my son who usually criticises films but even he was impressed. This is a film that you will want to turn the volume up loud for, so it scares the pants off you.Now for the ending...the best bit. Spectacular. I will not say any more as I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but if you like a good suspenseful film that will keep you wondering who is good and who is bad to the end, this is it.There should be a 'part 2' to follow on...",9,0,2,7 April 2016
