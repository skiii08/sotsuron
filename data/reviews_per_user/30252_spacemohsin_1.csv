Iron Man 3," Iron Man: The suit vs The man
","The new Mark 42 suit is designed by Tony and that means all new features and all new problems. In most part of the movies the suit is depicted as a faulty prototype, but even Tony has some issues. Tony has his nightmares and anxiety attacks from The Avengers hole travel (which might cause problems for any Avenger superhero if they ever want to go to the other Worlds, but anyways). Though both the man and the suit has its own problems they have never been stronger. Tony has never been more smarter with extreme intelligence shown through out; and of course the suits new powers which I will let you see for yourself! So who was the hero in the movie? The suits which gave backup and were present where Tony could not reach (which includes his absence in his romantic life) Or Tony Stark the genius who needs no support from me. The answer is one cannot live without the other! Tony says it in the end that 'I will always be Iron Man' he says that's the one thing no one can steal. I have heard enough reviews that say this movie is more focused on Tony than Iron Man! Iron man is Tony and vice versa. Has anyone differentiated Bruce Banner and the Hulk? No. (except Bruce who wants to get rid of it on many occasions) Does anyone say that The Incredible Hulk movie was more focused on Bruce than Hulk? No. So why do that for Iron Man? Give it a thought!",9,0,4,11 May 2013
