Scarface," A Big Score
","'Scarface' is a near-to-masterpiece, due to the amazing cast and the plot that makes you feel the tension and the excitement the film has to offer. Just like in other mafia classics, such as 'Goodfellas', that tension, that overwhelms you while watching, releases and turns into joy and satisfaction while walking towards the exit in the theater hallway after the film ends.Al Pacino also plays a huge role, his performance is stunning and memorable. It is no doubt that is one of his best performances, because he is very involved and all his dedication and talent are shown in this role as Tony Montana. The film, of course, couldn't be so thrilling without Michelle Pfeiffer's Elvira Hancock. Her role is similar to Sharon Stone's in Martin Scorsese's 'Casino'; a depressed, frustrated late-twenties/early-thirties married woman.Here's only one thing to complain about 'Scarface'. Is Brian De Palma's directing, which simply doesn't deliver anything, but B-class movie material. De Palma might not be a bad director, he is actually talented and ambitious, but this time he didn't do his best.All in all, this film should be watched, because, even though it is poorly directed, the cast, the plot and the script are great.",7,1,3,4 July 2016
Catch Me If You Can," One Of The Best Biographical Films
","'Catch Me If You Can' is one of the Steven Spielberg's gorgeously crafted real life adaptations, along side with 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan'. The only major difference between 'Catch Me If You Can' and the other two is that this is obviously the only one with humorist moments, but not because of intended comedy, which is none, but due to one of Leonardo Di Caprio's most interesting and charming characters, Frank William Abagnale, all combined with the hilarious moments.This movie also features Christopher Walken in almost his best acting performance, as Frank Abagnale. Just like in Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction', Walken touches us only by saying a few words, and so, he is simply magnificent. Furthermore, we have Tom Hanks, which fits perfectly in his role. A no-sense-of-humor federal agent, devoted and implicated in finishing his task? Hanks is definitely the best choice.To conclude, 'Catch Me If You Can' is another entertaining, effortlessly watchable Steven Spielberg film, that catches us in a lot of positive ways.",9,2,3,6 July 2016
