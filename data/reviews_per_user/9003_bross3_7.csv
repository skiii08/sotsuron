Antz," Big starpower, Big disappointment
","I was impressed with all the big names that were in this film and figured that it just HAD to be at least marginally entertaining.  And I was right--it was sometimes marginally entertaining.  I just couldn't help thinking that this could have been a much better film by doing one of two things: making this completely a childrens' movie, or making it a 'grownup' movie.  As it is, Antz wobbles back and forth and just doesn't do either job very well.The animation just wasn't consistently good.  Sometimes the screen was filled with beautiful eye candy, and other times it was just a plain screen with an unmoving, undetailed head of an ant that looked like something from an old video game on my old computer.The supposedly deep underlying social messages just didn't work for me.  I wasn't inspired by the emotional music and all the references to other movies just seemed to fall flat.  The film's big adventures didn't seem all that adventuresome or exciting.If they wanted to make a dark comedy for adults, they marketed the film wrong, and definitely didn't put in very much dark comedy (although the potential was definitely there).  If they wanted to make a kids' movie that adults would enjoy, they somehow missed that mark as well...  Next time out I hope Dreamworks has a more coherent plan before they start 'filming'.",6,2,4,10 November 1999
Chinatown," An incredibly rich film
","Everybody's already commented on the ingenious screenplay and the amazing characters, acting, direction.  I've only seen the wide-screen version, but I can't imagine that a formatted version would be able to retain the full beauty of this film.  The film makes ample use of the whole screen and the film comes across remarkably refreshing all these years later.  The use of sound is also very effective--whether it's a dripping faucet, the buzzing of insects or the endless other tiny details that have been crammed into Chinatown.",9,2,3,17 April 1999
The Big Lebowski," I don't think I'll ever get tired of this movie
","Since I got the Big Lebowski on VHS several months ago, it's been in my VCR almost constantly.  This rich, multi-layered comedy just seems to get better with each additional viewing--perhaps because no matter how hard you puzzle over the film, you'll never quite be able to understand everything about it at once.  I equate The Big Lebowski to 12 Monkeys in that regard--both films are wildly entertaining on the surface, slightly ominous underneath, and have moments of pure genius throughout.Each of the Coens' films seems to be their take on a certain part of the country, in particular criminal activity gone awry in each area--with numerous references to their favorite movies thrown in.  The Big Lebowski seems to take L.A. head-on and show us the city as something 'every bit as stupefying as in any of those other places'.  If Fargo and The Big Sleep are combined with modern L.A., The Big Lebowski would be the result. 
Jeff Bridges and John Goodman seem to be perfectly cast because their back-and-forth banter is hilarious.  I actually can't think of a character that I would have cast differently--every character is memorable and thoroughly entertaining in its own way.  The way they play off one another and affect the Dude's travels is just crazy. There is some really great writing in this film and the soundtrack is really great (especially the dream sequences).  If you only watch the movie once, you're probably missing a lot of things.I tend to like movies that break 'conventions', and this is definitely one of those films.  The main characters aren't glamorous at all, the film's only sex scene is hilarious in contrast to the typical hollywood scene, and there isn't a coherent plot that can be outlined in a nice simple layout that everybody will understand.  Just like the main characters, the film seems to bumble around aimlessly--but all the bumbling somehow resonates with coherence by the time it's all over.You'll either love this movie or hate it.  If you're offended by drug use (even though the film hardly glamorizes the use of drugs--it shows what happens to the 'Dude' after years of drug abuse... he's an unemployed former Roadie for Metallica...) or profanity (I think this movie probably set the record for the use of the F-word--but it's always sort of melded into the conversation and you hardly even notice it after a while) this may not be the film for you.  But I bet if you give The Big Lebowski a chance, it'll get under your skin.",9,0,1,6 November 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," You're going to have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company.
","This film must require a certain sense of humor combined with an understanding of the cold war and the nuclear arms race.  It always strikes me that people that don't quite 'get' Dr. Strangelove and I'm not really sure why.  There is a lot of subtle humor inserted into this black comedy and I suppose you have to be paying attention to really find it all.  During my first viewing I thought it was fairly slow and while there were clearly moments of genius, they seemed to be relatively far apart.  Now when I watch it, it's a series of ridiculously perfect scenes put together without a single wasted frame.  Dr. Strangelove is the strongest indictment of war and militarism that I have ever seen.  Kubrick somehow created for us a film that sums up the absurd peril that the world faced during the cold war and also allowed us to laugh at the men who were responsible for keeping the world from falling into chaos and destruction.  The fact that this film seems somehow plausible and possible makes it all the more scary.",10,4,6,6 November 1999
Dark City," Unmet potential
","Quite an engaging film with a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, the final quarter of the film just seemed like such a huge let-down.  It should have been exciting, but instead it just turned into absurdity.  (granted, I had suspended belief long before that point... it just jarred me into the 'yeah right' state of mind at the end)Films like the Matrix have their share of plot holes (and then some)--but the Matrix is thoroughly entertaining throughout, if somewhat predictable. 
Dark City's acting is not especially good and the characters are fairly unmemorable.  The underlying premise is quite ingenious, but the plot seems to unravel at the end and tie things up a bit too easily.  The 'happily ever after' tone of the end definitely seemed uncalled for.
Dark City tries to be profound but just leaves you with the feeling of dissatisfaction at what could have been a great film.(and no... I don't know how *I* would've ended it, either) :>",6,1,3,5 November 1999
Aliens," Still terrifyingly exciting after all these years...
","Nearly 15 years after its initial release, this film still seems just as fresh and scary.  How many other films in the sci-fi genre can say that? Aliens definitely made use of some fancy special effects and elaborate sets, but nothing was there just for eye candy.  It all adds to the effect and as a result, it still works today.I hadn't seen this film for about 10 years when I rented it the other day, actually expecting it to look silly and dated... the kind of film that scares you to death at 12 but seems silly at 22.  Instead it was just as intense as I remembered.  The only possible thing that seemed to take away from my enjoyment was that it has been so widely (and unsuccessfully) copied over the years that we've all seen this before.Just as amazing and gripping as it ever was.  When the closing credits make their way onto the screen you feel as though you have just gotten off a roller coaster--somewhat exhilarated, but also slightly disoriented and still trying to absorb everything that you've just experienced.Best film of the series, Aliens really shines quite well as a stand-alone film.  Script alludes to the first film and leaves openings for future films, but does this unobtrusively so it isn't annoying.A great film to watch late at night with all the lights turned off.  Just be sure to barricade the doors and keep one of those motion sensors handy...",8,0,0,6 November 1999
A Bug's Life," A return to childhood imagination
","I have no clue exactly what it is about this cute movie, but watching it has to be one of the most fun things to do that I can think of.  Throughout the whole movie I have this stupid grin on my face (I must look like some kind of mental patient).  The ants are perfectly animated (no, perhaps not realistic though) and their feelings and emotion seem to come through as though they were human characters.  The humor is great for all ages.  Quite a good film.",8,0,0,14 November 1999
