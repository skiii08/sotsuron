Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," About as exciting as watching paint dry
","I tried to like this movie, I wanted to like this movie but try as I might I just couldn't...because basically it bored me to tears. For those of you who argue that years of fans expectations was what caused crushing disappointment I disagree....No it wasn't disappointed expectations that made me dislike this movie...it was just so boring...When episode 4 was released I was too young to appreciate it...by the time episode 6 came along I was old enough to enjoy it. I was interested when epidode 1 was on its because Star Wars was something of a legend by this time. I wasn't a huge fan but I remembered the first star wars movies as something fun. I got to see episode one on video and It was really dull. Sure the effects were beautiful and much of it was like a beautifully painted picture..but I didn't want to watch a 2 hour moving painting..because that's what it amounted to basically...the characters were so dull and I didn't give a damn about any of them.Star Wars episode 4 came on television recently...I decided to watch it...I only had vague memories of it...but I was amazed at how great it was...I loved the characters...even the special effects..outdated as they may be gave me more of a sense of being there, of realism and I cared about the characters in the movie...If the Phantom Menace didn't have the Star Wars legacy behind it I doubt anyone would have given it the time of day.",Null,0,1,29 November 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," We loved it!
","I've always said 'Special effects do not a good movie make' however I'll make an exception concerning 'The Day After Tomorrow'. What did I love about the effects so much? The realism. What unfolded before me on the screen looked so real, felt so real, that I found myself totally drawn in and captivated. I went to see this with my family including my 85 year old Grandmother and we all loved it. We all felt it was the best disaster movie we had seen. Sure it's full of scientific plot holes but the movie was so captivating that I was able to suspend disbelief. If I had seen this movie on video I would probably feel different. It's the type of movie you have to see on the big screen to appreciate. Just watching New York being flooded and seeing the statue of Liberty as a poignant object in a frozen wasteland is worth the prize of admission. I also enjoyed the storyline. I felt for the characters and their plight. Get yourself a bucket of popcorn, suspend your disbelief and sit back and enjoy one hell of a ride.",Null,0,0,30 May 2004
