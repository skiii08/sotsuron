Requiem for a Dream," Perhaps I missed something?
","This is one of those movies I heard would 'change my life,' that I HAD to see it because it was SO profound.Well, to me, it wasn't. Honestly, it's just a bunch of drug clich√©s, loosely latched together with a sad storyline. The familiar subject matter and emotions it instigates are of course authentic, and therefore relevant to many people, but again exploting drug culture better than any film before it doesn't seem to be a landmark achievement to me, it seems to be a drug film. Following this, I watched Pi by the same director and that stands as one of my most hated movies I've ever seen. Perhaps I just don't like the director, or perhaps nothing special is really going on.I've been exposed to drugs plenty in real life, this is absolutely nothing new to me. Capturing some of the stigma and sadness on film? Perhaps, but some segments are quite fictitious, and I don't think this film really needs to be on the top 250 list. One mans opinion.",4,1,4,21 April 2007
Pi," What?
","This movie honestly confused the hell out of me. Being someone fairly interested/talented in math and science, I was absolutely lost as to the entire mathematical/scientific storyline being completely bogus. After reading some reviews, people don't even seem to mind. 'It's fine the storyline makes no sense,' no, it's really not. That alone was enough to turn me off, but the bad sound (Was that what it was? The music and effects just really started to irritate me, who knows) and over-the-top acting just made it worse.I'm all for independent cinema, in fact that's the career I'm seriously considering at the moment, but independent is NOT in any way, shape or form an excuse for bad. Writing a scientific, mathematically themed script with 100% bogus science and math is absolutely wrong. Film makers are expected to have done research and know what they are talking about. Pi simply fails, and takes too many cinematic risks that don't equate to a good movie, but rather a poorly thatched together piece. It just didn't work.Lastly, the religion element was over the top and entirely un-necessary. Those scientifically and religiously minded are typically VERY averse to each other, even if it isn't always so you don't want to mix the two, and doing so in this movie I'm sure turned a lot of people off.",1,48,84,21 April 2007
Grindhouse," It's FUN
","If you go into the movie expecting anything serious (Especially along the lines of Pulp Fiction / Kill Bill) you'll be sadly disappointed. But for the growing number of cinema viewers perfectly content just having fun, letting a movie be stupid/entertaining you'll love it. (The same kind of vibe I get from Kevin Smith's work for the most part, aside from Chasing Amy/Dogma none of his work is really all that classy, however it's quite good).Also, see it in theaters. I don't think this will work as well on DVD, the audience effect along with some editing techniques they used make this a much more live audience theater-favorable movie. If you let someone else's pessimism seep into you it'll ruin the film.",10,1,5,21 April 2007
