Kill Bill: Vol. 2," just awful ... an anti-climatic waste of time
","Anyone that calls these Kill Bill movies `masterpiece' has an IQ less then their shoe size. This movie is poorly paced and the dialogue is insipid. Tarantino could make a film of himself taking a dump from inside the toilet and there would be rabid fans talking about how he's 'extending' the genre. You set up Bill as being the most feared and deadly assassin and warrior in the world... You take two movies to reach him and then QT teases you by having the characters talk about a swordfight on the beach under the full moon, and instead the ending was lame and predictable.  There wasn't even a good fight (one fight and it's not even with Bill!).  A few critics actually let their admiration for Tarantino's past work get in the way of giving this movie the reviews it deserved. Those critics have completely lost all credibility.  Thank goodness the American people have given their votes with poor attendance to this dud.",Null,11,19,13 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," tedious stylized stupidity with an idiotic and surprisingly dull conclusion
","Anyone that calls these Kill Bill movies `masterpiece' has an IQ less then their shoe size. Tarantino could make a film of himself taking a dump from inside the toilet and there would be rabid fans talking about how he's 'extending' the genre. If I'm not mistaken, from 'inside the bowl,' he smells just like everyone else. Give his sainthood a rest already. It's poorly paced and the dialogue is insipid. What to attribute this to then? Poor direction or poor use of editing software? Volume 2 trades its buckets of blood for pages of dry dialogue that explore the history of these characters but bring us nowhere new. It was far easier to swallow The Bride's bitter quest for revenge than this. Tarantino's self-adored mysticism and issues with self-indulgence this time around make it the boring mess that this post talks about. There are a few scenes that seem like they could've been cut out in the editing room without a problem, or at least shortened. If they would've released this movie as one long film, I bet half of the dull volume 2 would've hit the cutting room floor. It was either sheer greed or sheer stupidity that made them split it into this mess.And so the adventure continues. . . it's just too bad it conned me into wasting my $8.50 on such an idiotic and surprisingly dull conclusion.",Null,16,33,29 April 2004
Men in Black 3," A completely unremarkable cotton candy movie
","I have to say that going in to this movie that I was expecting it to be absurd (how could it not given the other two efforts) but completely unremarkable I did not see coming. Along the lines of the first film but with less charm and really no solid action in my opinion, this film is a cotton candy and gas combination film. Bubbly sugar farts result and if that's what you're looking for then this is the perfect movie.On the plus side, Will Smith hits all the right notes. Still, the logic flaws demand that the viewer can't take the film seriously even for a moment and there's not enough humor, heart or action to carry the movie any higher than an average to below average rating. I have to call this one a big let down.",Null,5,11,1 June 2012
The Expendables 2," It crosses the line from popcorn action to a long SNL skit...
","This movie delivers exactly what is expected to a fault. It's filled with dumb, nonsensical action with lots of explosions and CGI blood spurts but no imagination or heart. I probably would have enjoyed it more had they not been so blatantly mugging for the camera and filling scenes with inside jokes geared for all the aging stars. It crosses the line from popcorn action to a long SNL skit by the time they work in 'I'll be back' and 'Yippe-kie-yea' and Chuck Norris jokes. I like the cast and there is some good action. The finale is damn cool with all the big guns (stars and actual firearms) going off. All they needed was the hot Asian actress to shoot that scene topless and it would be the quintessential all-time mindless guy-flick action scene. Honestly, a step down from the first film and it's not like that one was an all-time classic.",Null,3,7,31 August 2012
Iron Man 3," Finally, A Brilliant Number Three Film!
","I had high expectations going in to this film and it managed to hit or exceed almost all of them. I simply loved that nothing held to any type of cliché. Nearly every interaction delivered something unexpected and fresh. Stark was shaken to his very core by the events of Avengers and further more by the events early in this film. Make no mistake, this movie is all about Tony Stark's struggles both external and especially internal. Choosing to focus on Tony out of the armor is a wonderful decision. RDJ is as brilliant as he's ever been as Stark. Fans of the books (of which I'm one) may complain about certain character translations but I really have no complaints. Flexibility has always been a Marvel strength over the years and I liked how they flexed and twisted certain ideas here. The thing they get so right from the books is the ingenuity of Tony Stark. He's so much more than a man in a metal suit. It's his brain and his wit that are the true weapons. This movie goes out of its way to illustrate that brilliantly.The armored adventure scenes do thrill but are spaced by gritty old fashion action and a movie filled with a lot of heart and humor. Again, it was well played and I found it to be genuinely refreshing while bold all at the same time. No one can accuse them of playing it safe.As for the supporting cast, the results were spotty. Pepper is given her due and Killian is an amazing villain. The rest of the supporting cast is barely seen and underutilized. Despite one very cool hero moment, Rhodey isn't fleshed out at all. I can't say much about The Mandarin. Overall, it's a well crafted, funny and refreshing number three film that wraps up the trilogy beautifully.",Null,1,6,4 May 2013
Captain Marvel," 5/10 with no tension and as 'MEH' as it gets
","First off a huge negative is the fact that the character of Captain Marvel herself has all the interest and personality of dry toast... lots and lots of dry toast. Maybe that appeals to some but not to me. The strange thing is that I don't think it can be blamed on Brie Larson's poor performance but rather an extremely mundane and joyless script. Second, there is absolutely no tension at all in any of the plot points. No danger to Carol or to anyone that is with her. With no sense of danger, there is no thrill to any of the action. Not when powered up Carol takes on the Starforce and not when Ronan launches missiles you know will not find a target or threaten anyone. Honestly, I have watched Agents of Shield TV episodes with more thrills and tension. This entire movie because of the 'meh' factor didn't feel like a big budget MCU epic that we've come to expect. What aids to save face are its overall ties to that MCU. Fury was a bit of a neutered tool but he was still likeable and interesting. It was great to see young Phil Coulson even if ever so briefly. The Tesseract tie and the Skrulls were damn cool and they referenced what was to come without completely ruining what we've already seen and enjoyed in the MCU. (Except the Fury eye loss, that adds a BAD cringe factor) I seriously hope that for Endgame they limit Captain Marvel's presence because even after two hours spent with her she is just such an uninteresting character.",Null,2,3,8 March 2019
Iron Man 2," Oscar Caliber On Every Level (Story, FX & Especially Acting)
","Everyone will rave about the action but Iron Man 2 delivers a beguiling character study behind and above the special effects. You do not leave your I.Q. at the door with this summer movie as you too often need to do. The award winning cast doesn't back down and delivers up to their talent. They're rising to the material, and even elevating it to levels rarely seen in a comic adaptation film. Robert Downey Jr delivers another remarkable performance. Giving one of our generation's greatest actors such a cool character to bring to life happens once in a lifetime. Watching him draw on ALL emotions is as good as it gets. Not to give any spoilers but there's a dark side to Tony Stark because of his impending death and that aspect of the film makes Downey shine. Add the flair and superhero text and we may be talking Oscar. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also bring their top stuff.Aided by those great performances, the writing delivers genuine wit and is strong across the board. I think a lot of summer films are lost in pre-production when they decide to shoot a dumb script or make it up as they go along. Clearly, Iron Man 2 must have had a strong script and great writers. They avoid a lot of the mistakes other films like this make. The story is as good as any comic book adaptation I've ever seen. The plot actually tugs at the heart strings, makes you think and still hits the funny bone more then once. The story and epic battles make perfect sense. What I liked about the first Iron Man is that it was somewhat grounded in reality. No teenage boys or small girls as superheroes or men dressing up as rodents, not that there's inherently anything wrong with those turns. I simply like fantasy grounded in reality. The effects really did surpass what they did before and I actually thought the last time out they deserved FX Oscar consideration. These are some of the best scenes out of any action film ever. Best of all, I couldn't tell what was Computer Generated Images and what was practical.Yes, that's twice I mentioned Oscar so I might as well do it a third time. A nomination for best picture wouldn't surprise me at all at this point. I really loved this movie.",Null,35,76,27 April 2010
Argo," One of the year's best!
","How to judge a film like this? Every film features arbitrary factors on what makes it enjoyable or not. Films based on real life situations carry certain baggage but none of that baggage weighed this gem down at all. I honestly can't think of a way to make the movie better. Thus, it merits a 10/10 in my book. It's so very well acted and constructed. I was captivated all the way through and Affleck made it suspenseful to the max. Politically, there are some modern parallels to what's happening today but that texture isn't even relevant to enjoying the effort as a pure thriller.One of the top three films made this year to date. Excellence all the way around.",Null,2,4,24 October 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," CGI Mess = VERY annoying overkill
","The ONLY intention of this ridiculous movie is presumably to keep you on the edge of your seat through any nonsensical means possible. Even that lone goal fails miserably. Seeing the same effects over and over again numbs the brain as much as listening to the dumbest dialogue exchanges in the history of the cinema. This movie exits in a hyper-reality where the world is like a giant video game and every plot turn defies the laws of physics and common sense. I found that to be VERY annoying.Sorting through all the tiresome hype and relentless BS and focusing on the movie itself is refreshing at this point. The film suffers on a few fronts. One, there is little emotional connection between any of the characters (especially the limp romantic emotional misfire). Two, everything not CGI stupidity simply saps the energy gained by any action scene. Third, a lot of those action scenes scream 'overkill' to me. The same ideas and effects used over and over equal boring. Think movies like 2012 or the last Mummy flick. There are flaws in logic literally from the one minute mark through the entire running time but I guess everyone expects that in most summer popcorn these days.",Null,14,28,26 May 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Outstanding In Every Way That Matters
","The pace is great and the action is unbelievable. I couldn't believe that almost two hours had gone by when it was over. Visually, it's a sight to behold, with impressive special effects and a dynamic sense of presence. I really think this is one of the best comic book movies ever, and I'm not exaggerating. It's not as complex as Iron Man or The Dark Knight but it's loaded with intense fun. Everything in this movie is exceedingly better then what we saw in X3. I'm glad they decided to head in this direction because X4 might have gone off the tracks even more and this movie proves that focusing on one X-Man may be the way to go with a lot of supporting help. Characters find their own distinctiveness and just flat out kick butt. The plot avoids pitfalls as the situations become more dire. They're a group of characters who are well written (for the massive size and scope of this epic) and full of small, personal moments that transcend their four-color origins. Well done.",Null,23,49,27 April 2009
Constantine," The ultimate in good vs evil with great action and a stellar cast...what's not to like?
","It's good to see that out of the top movies released in 2005 so far, the best in terms of quality are both comic adaptation films. Elektra was a good film and Constantine is even better then Elektra. I know it's early but both outclass everything else 2005 has to offer.I enjoyed Constantine and absolutely loved the Theological issues. The ultimate in good Vs evil with great action and a stellar cast...what's not to like? I have never read or even heard of a Hellblazer comic book and maybe that was an advantage for me. Coming in fresh to this film, I had no preconceived notions. The resulting story and exposition was masterfully done. I don't understand what some of the people who have been critical of this film were expecting. It's suspenseful from beginning to end and features top quality CGI. This is honestly the best work Keanu has done since the original Matrix and FAR better then the horrible mess the sequels to that film turned out to be. Nine out of ten easily from me.",Null,9,24,23 February 2005
Troy," Depressing and Unsatisfying Throughout
","This film was as far away from a `feel good movie' as you can get.  This was actually a clumsy film about the legends of Troy that was formulaic until the last.  Even if you didn't know the story, Hector's long goodbye tells you what is to follow.  The director's awkward cut to young Paris as he practices with his bow and arrow tells you what's to come.  It's just poor, hold your hand, storytelling.  I did like the set up of both the Achilles and Hector characters.  When they meet in battle, you really don't know whom to route for. After that battle, the film degenerates into a depressing mess that really seemed to turn off the audience that I saw the film with.  The rather large crowd even seemed dejected as they walked out of the theatre. I couldn't blame them because, although well acted, this movie left me feeling very unsatisfied and I can guarantee that I won't be watching this movie ever again.",Null,2,7,17 May 2004
Thor: Ragnarok," this movie was a joy to experience and a blast to watch!
","The hype and reputation of this movie set expectations in a weird place. Critic reception is through the roof and some talk of it being a pure comedy tuned out to be grossly exaggerated. First and foremost the film has a proper amount of gravitas. It's not overtly 'jokey' Scenes and actions have real weight. Thor and Loki both have great character arcs and both characters are fleshed out quite well. The very beginning did give me pause. I feared that the early tone and rather light handling of epic characters from the books would make me hate this film. How Surtur, Skurge, Volstagg and Fandril are handled in the first 15 minutes frankly ticked me off. Even Loki seemed off at first. Yet, as the film unfolded most everything fell in to place nicely and everything seemed to fit the movie perfectly.The action and the visuals are as amazing as advertised. Even Valkyrie worked as a character even though I was not sold on the casting choice. She could easily be any Valkyrie and not the specific one from the books. This third effort puts a wonderful bow on the trilogy with healthy nods to the previous two films. Yet, this certainly stands on its own and is very unique. Hela is a superb villain and this is the best Hemsworth has ever been. Allowed to settle after a stumbling start, this movie was a joy to experience and a blast to watch.",Null,2,8,5 November 2017
The Book Thief," A Flat Out Amazing and Emotional Instant Classic!
","This is a flat out amazing film. It's nuanced, extremely thoughtful and features some of the strongest performances of the year. If I had a vote, we'd get another young teenage girl nominated for 'best actress' in a lead role for Sophie Nelisse's amazing work. Everyone's work here is award worthy. Sure, the subject matter may seem like a rehash (The Diary of Anne Frank'/'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas'/The Pianist') but it really isn't. It's fresh, and packs the most emotional impact of any film that I've seen all year. Captivating and extremely powerful, the film is hauntingly beautiful. It moves at an effortless pace which allows the viewer to become immersed in the realities of Liesel's situation. That pace may not be for everyone but I found it to be perfect. Everything breaths properly and every connection made is heartfelt and meaningful. The literary vehicle of death as the narrator really is a masterstroke and works perfectly. It starts the film and finishes but is never intrusive. I honestly feel this film is an instant classic. It really stayed with me after watching it and I'm still moved by its impact.",Null,98,128,10 December 2013
Elf," not funny but shallow entertainment for kids
","I was disappointed in this movie simply because it wasn't a comedy.  It was just a simple kid/family movie about a naïve if not slightly retarded man who thinks he's an elf.  Even in a movie about Santa, the leaps that Cann's character and Elf's girlfriend made by the end of the movie were unbelievable.  Why would a pretty blonde like that even talk to an elfin retard who can't figure out an escalator? If you're going to throw the sap around, at least make it somewhat believable. This disappointing movie contains exactly TWO laughs.  The first occurs early when they explain that elves can only do three jobs (shoe repair, cookie maker, Santa worker) and shows the hazards of putting an oven in an oak tree. The second, is when elf tries to top the tree with a star using a couch as a trampoline.  Other then this, the movie is just shallow entertainment for kids under the age of ten. Don't go in to this movie looking for a comedy.",Null,0,1,19 December 2003
Captain America: The First Avenger," Well Done. Blows Films Like Batman Begins Out of the Water
","If you compare this Captain America film to any of the origin films in its genre, it ranks right at the top. It's remarkable how well they cast and wrote this film. It's complex yet perfectly paced. It would compare very favorably to Iron Man, Spider-Man and Thor. In fact, I'd say it incorporates the best of those three classic origins but adds its own flare. That places Cap FAR ahead of films like Batman Begins, Superman or Elektra. All those flawed films couldn't get out of their own way. Batman Begins was flawed at every turn. Superman was great for its day but the cheese spoiled over time. Elektra was as big of a mess as Batman Begins in terms of plot and silly action. I'm so glad Cap avoided the pitfalls that hurt those films.Everything Cap delivers results in making every character believable and relate-able. What results is a thrill ride that delivers at every point of the running time. It also delivers depth and intelligence. Now THAT is how to tell an origin right.",Null,1,4,14 August 2011
Justice League," Not offensively bad but not good either... so shallow
","This was completely 'meh' in most every way possible. Not offensively bad like Batman V Superman, but certainly not good either. Everything came across as shallow and the CGI bad guy is the absolute worst. Why on earth did they need to go all CGI and not use an actor? I do totally agree with studio execs that forced them to keep the run time under two hours. Since everyone NOT Wonder Woman in this cinematic universe is terribly one dimensional, adding thirty minutes or more of mindless prattle would have been a terrible idea. Basically, there is no developing characters this shallow to start with... might as well go all video game cut scene action. As for Wonder Woman, THAT is the true ace the WB has going for them. Not the character so much as the actress they stumbled upon to play her. Talk about finding absolute gold. Gal Gadot hypnotizes and captivates on screen no matter what she is doing. Add action to her natural beauty and charm and you literally can't get enough of her in to the story. I'm sure they realize that the focus should be on her from here forward. Of the new characters, only Cyborg has any hint of depth at all. Both Flash and Aquaman are cardboard wastes so far. So, the DCEU is truly stuck in the shallow end of the pool but maybe Wonder Woman can single-handedly tow the universe to deeper and more interesting waters.Best overall quote I've read: 'Justice League was the cinematic equivalent of watching a classmate give a presentation they totally forgot about'",Null,37,71,17 November 2017
The Matrix Revolutions," Huge Misfire & Huge Disappointment
","Like Reloaded, Revolutions pretended to be smart and philosophical by over-dressing it with obscure references to 'choice' and 'destiny' (oh the clichés), but ultimately there was no thought put into the writing. Even the action scenes were on the weak and flimsy side. The entire movie lacked the energy of the original. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma, and there was no character development at all. Since the movie put way too much emphasis on the characters, this was a serious problem. The best thing they did was put a sock over Keanu's eyes for part of this movie.  At least we avoided seeing him try and act sad.  This film had some nice effects that quickly became boring as their setup and overuse flowed for far too long. This third installment rips off everyone from Daredevil to Jesus.  Their `savior' Neo... well it's obvious. We see blind Neo `see' using a strikingly similar shadow world concept. Daredevil anyone?

","Maybe sentimentality got the better of me but whatever the case, I enjoyed this movie. Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams and even Justin Timberlake are all wonderful in their roles. Sure the story itself is predictable and not really deep but the film does deliver heart. I liked John Goodman's character but the rest of the supporting cast of characters is shallow to the point of cheese.

Cold Mountain," Terribly Overrated
","Cold Mountain is a film that's been receiving a lot of buzz in my circle of friends. A film with a cast list to die for, and a trailer promising a potential Oscar contender. I admit, that I too thought that it looked excellent, but that was as high as I let my expectations rise. I'm glad I did now, because, I would definitely have hated Cold Mountain if I'd gone in expecting the film of the year. It would be a real shame if anyone does end up with unjust feelings of vehemence toward Cold Mountain though, because it's not a film that warrants such feelings as there are a lot of area's in which it excels.

","I can't say the film was engaging from the start even though it mindlessly jumps in to the action almost immediately. It does get better as the film unfolds, however. A lot of what appears to make no sense whatsoever actually does by the time the film concludes. Some plot points still don't add up and the canvas of the film is too epic for its own good... wild and unbelievable assassination plots against the big gun leaders of the world. Angelina apparently possesses superpowers they never explain because no human (female or male) could possibly do what she does in the film. Another problem that plagues the film is the fact that they never really establish Angelina's character enough to empathize with her. Did anyone not see the 'plot twist' coming a mile away???

The Amazing Spider-Man," Not Bad but a VERY Average Film
","I did my best to judge this film on its own merits and NOT based on anything that has come before or how I feel it would measure up to the past trilogy. Based on what hit the screen, this is one very mediocre effort. Yes, it has its moments and the groundwork has been laid for the possibility of better things to come but this origin film is as unremarkable as it gets. It's not bad but it's just not memorable or superb in any way. I do believe the story would have been far better had they skipped the actual origin altogether. I found it strange that the first act dragged yet no one was really fleshed out or developed. What's the point then? If you're going to try and gain emotional attachment to Ben and May then have them do SOMETHING or impart some wisdom. As a fan, I find it criminal that they didn't even use the famous 'With great power comes great responsibility' line. The villain is one dimensional and there's not one action sequence that stands out. I even hated the forced ham-fisted sequences towards the end with the construction workers and police officers. On the positive side, Garfield was good and Emma Stone was great in the lead roles. They made you care about both characters enough to save the movie. As stated, maybe they can take off from here but I doubt there's any large percentage of people that leaves the theatre after watching this one that's very impressed or that can't wait to see what's next. Interest? Maybe but there's not much to be passionate about unless the viewer is a HUGE Emma Stone or Garfield fan.Having said that and watching the movie as fairly as I could. NOW I can make the comparisons and frankly, this movie falls short of all three of Raimi's efforts.Yes, even Spider-Man 3 is the better all around film. I've always said that SM3 is an overcrowded film but it certainly has its moments. Besides far better action sequences, SM3 has more emotional impact and truly stand out moments. Sure, it also has 'stub your toe' moments but the good outweighs the bad. Amazing Spider-Man has many monotone moments with a bit of heart sprinkled in. Nothing seems deep or really hits home. Even Uncle Ben's demise falls terribly flat and it's almost glossed over. SM3 swung for the fences and served up some tasty treats and some sours ones as well. This movie feels phoned in and serves up vanilla everything.",Null,4,8,4 July 2012

This is a movie in which a dog is doused with gasoline and burned to death; a young boy is choked repeatedly by his father, then his father is beaten to death before his eyes; two 7-year-old children are ordered to strip and have sex by a pedophile with a camera; and when the main character is sent to prison for murder, some skinheads develop a queer eye for the straight guy. For the record, The Butterfly Effect has absolutely nothing to do with butterflies, and its only obvious `effect' is to make you want to take a shower.

No Country for Old Men," AWFUL =The WORST Movie Going Experience Of My Life
","I'm sorry but anyone that thinks this movie is clever or deep is certifiably insane.I've literally seen thousands of films at the theatre in my life and the response to this thing was something I've never seen before. It was a near revolt. I actually saw people angrily walking to get a refund. This exchange perfectly sums up this waste of film...The woman seated behind me turns to the people she was with and says, 'Bill, that was the LAST time you pick the movie.' He responds, 'I'm soooo sorry. That was completely awful.' I turned to my friends and apologized as well. They were there because I wanted to see it. I had to apologize all the way to the parking lot.Anyone here labeling it a masterpiece or thinking it's a textured, complex film couldn't be more wrong. This was nothing more then a blatant attempt to shatter the cookie cutter Hollywood genre picture using poor dialogue and offbeat characters. That was its ONLY goal. Creating unpredictable crap may have helped it accomplish that goal but that doesn't make it good work in any way. It certainly doesn't qualify as entertainment.SPOILERS follow but I'd advise those who haven't seen it to read them. This could save you money and wasted time...Killing the lead barely three quarters of the way through the movie, OFF SCREEN, may seem clever to some but it's just so irritating to most. The movie does take the tedious time to try to emotionally involve you with the characters and the story. What I can't understand is how anyone can think that frustrating an audience is good cinema. Callously killing multiple characters with no consequences, killing the lead off screen, killing his wife, having the insane psychopath villain walk away scott free (hurt by a random car wreck no less) and having Tommy Lee Jones' character quit and babble to the camera before a cut to black is as bad of a theatre experience as anyone could imagine. Clearly, my audience felt cheated and I was chief among them.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Massive disappointment that's often massively dull
","There's no dodging it, this is a massive disappointment on almost every level. It's an overly long and rather mind-numbing film that doesn't even offer the courtesy of a semblance of an ending. Yes, I know they are taking a page from the original trilogy and telling the tale in three parts but I wish they had at least offered some sort of payoff in this installment.The first forty minutes absolutely drags and is as tedious as any film in recent memory. The entire first act feels like a dull parody of a Disney/Snow White/Dwarfs film complete with two singing numbers. They couldn't even use that time to give us relatable bases or depth for the characters they want us to follow for three films. Bilbo is a sniveling ninny throughout all forty minutes and you can't tell one dwarf from the other outside of the king.Also, the CGI seems to be a step back which is bizarre. A lot of things and scenes looked horribly fake. I'm talking 'Clash of the Titans' remake bad CGI (except Gollum- he was again exceptional) Then, there's the same ole plot flaw from the very first film surrounding the use of those giant game changing eagles.All-in-all, there's nothing here that's thrilling and nothing that can come close to matching the grandeur or feel of the originals.",Null,4,16,14 December 2012
Hellboy," one huge, dumb disappointment
","I have to agree that Hellboy was one huge disappointment.  I can't imagine the studio getting their money back with that film.  How can a movie that's this dumb possibly recover its CGI bill alone?  I don't mean to insult any longtime fans but this film lacked so very much.  I honestly came in to this film as unbiased as a person can get.  In fact, as a comic fan in general, I was pulling for this film to be great.  I've never read Hellboy.  So, I don't know if the lack of character development is a writing flaw or a fault of Hollywood adaptation.  I also agree that this movie seem to degenerate into a nonsensical monster/horror flick and that, sadly, seemed to be its goal.   I, too, was frustrated by constant slaughter of the `good guys' as a way to build a story only to have the climax peter out in one thirty second swallow/explosion.  The only real exposition in the whole film developed Hellboy's father.  So, shouldn't his murder have been of use to this film? It served no purpose.  If Flaming chick hadn't said the line `no one has even spoken to him for three days and he won't eat' we would've never even noticed that Hellboy's father had died.  Hellboy didn't act any differently and the revenge factor never even happened.  He threw a guy that won't stay dead in a pit of spearsÂ… so what.  It's as if Del Torro realized that his budget was running out so he had to end the film as fast and as cheaply as possible.  Although wild, this movie wasn't even fun enough to recommend to friends and that's a shame because I wanted to rave about this one.",Null,0,1,6 April 2004
The Bourne Legacy," A Deeper Look At The Bourne Universe And That's A Good Thing!
","As a fan of the Bourne franchise, I enjoyed this deeper look in to that universe. The movie really does feel like one giant glorified DVD extra for that trilogy and I mean that in a good way. Deeper layers are revealed and the intrigue is as good as what we've seen before even though the character motivation isn't as strong across the board. Renner is fabulous as the second generation super spy. My only real complaint about this installment (because it does feel like they are blatantly building for three more films) is that the resolution has no real teeth. Still, it's a very good effort from a very good cast with hints and touches to the Bourne films of the past.Overall, a thumbs up and a very enjoyable time at the cinema.",Null,7,11,10 August 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," So bad.... actually offended by how bad this turned out.
","Based on the fact that I did not enjoy the first movie, I lowered my expectations yet still tried to judge this film on its own merit. Even so, I have to classify this effort as an absolute film travesty. It is all kinds of awful.I seriously am searching for something to like and I do absolutely love the character. Spidey looks great and I really do like the cast. It's too bad they gave them such a dumb story and such a bad script to shoot. There are so many things wrong with this effort that it's tough to sum up my utter contempt for what I saw unfold on screen. What struck me about an hour and a half in to the run time was the fact that nothing major was happening yet they managed to develop NOT one single character. Everything feels shallow and most nothing connects. They book end the film with cheesy Rhino moments that really deserve all the 'Batman & Robin' comparisons that I've read. (Spider-Man messing around in the opening truck chase should have gotten dozens of people killed for no reason) Seeing New Yorkers standing behind instant barricades watching gun battles and explosions happening less than 100 yards away as if it was some sort of Spider-Man sports contest actually made me cringe. That happens three times during the film. Electro was ridiculous and again, the parallels to the worst films the genre has ever produced are real and tangible. Harry Osborn is yet another wasted and unbelievable cheesy character.I do award a few salvation points for actually giving Aunt May a few scenes to shine (unlike the first film.) The action is completely forgettable except for the final Goblin showdown. That was well done (more salvation points). The slo-mo vibe is terrible and the soundtrack severely detracts from everything. The dialogue is as bad as it gets as is EVERYONE'S motivation.Overall, I'm a Marvel fan that is actually offended by how bad this turned out.",Null,31,61,2 May 2014
Lincoln," Shakespearian Flavor & Well Done
","To me, this film has a Shakespearian feel in its delivery and presentation. There is lots of flowery language and it's rhetorically ornate. There's a fine line between being elaborate when being true to Lincoln's legend or being excessive by using his speech rhetoric and style to craft his every sentence in a long film. This movie is marked by intricate detail but it never feels excessive. So, it juggles everything perfectly in my opinion.The behind the scenes look at a complex issue and a complex man really works if you're in the mood for a film where you need to focus and pay attention all the way through. As everyone has noted, the performances from what is an all-star cast are all wonderful and compelling. A special shout out to James Spader who just shines in a small part.",Null,3,10,26 November 2012

Here Comes the Boom," What A Pleasant Surprise! Capraesque Feel Good Film!
","High art this is not but anyone that expects high level stuff from a movie with this premise is not watching it with the right frame of mind. It's a good old fashion feel good film with a message. Dare I say Capraesque? I wouldn't even classify this as a comedy. It's a fantasy of goodwill film that induces plenty of smiles and packs heart. Kevin James is perfect in the lead and his common man qualities play extremely well here. They lean on the Rocky formula a lot but that's not necessarily a bad thing. One thing is for sure, Salma Hayek is the hottest 'Adrian' type love interest to ever play in this type of film. She's amazing throughout. A warm shout out to Henry Winkler who is also perfectly cast as the somewhat eccentric music teacher with the heart of gold.A wonderful surprise that I enjoyed very much.",Null,43,58,12 October 2012
Big Fish," Just like 2001's 'Planet of the Apes' - a complete failure.
","A fantasy film where telling tall tales should play right into Burton's strengths as a filmmaker. But for an imaginative film that relies on blowing the viewer away with fantastic scenes, I found it all too pedestrian and if you will...unimaginative. The storyline was slight and forgettable, and its sweating hard attempt to act the part of the aggressive traveling salesman to make me buy a product I didn't need with such a sugary sentimental pitch, never worked. After catching all those wild stories that blur the lines between reality and fantasy, with no tension coming forth and not anything real happening, I'm left wondering what it was all about. It would be too inane to believe that the filmmaker actually wants us to go for the bald-faced lie over anything real because it is so charmingly told, which is another way of adopting Hollywood's moneymaking code of giving the paying customers whatever they want as long as they feel entertained and the investors are happy with the box-office returns. But that is exactly what this film is about. Along with the superficial metaphors disclosed about death and love and an idyllic life, which are supposed to be poignant pronouncements for the film to cover-up all its emptiness and its attempts at doling out false hopes for those who buy into its premise.",Null,16,37,6 April 2004

But other than that, despite the fact that Edward was a charming man with a wonderful outlook on life, his stories were just not inspiring enough to generate any sort of emotion.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," bizarre but overrated
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind may be one of the most bizarre movies that I've ever sat through.  I understand its visual nature and its attempt at real emotion but it just didn't resonate with me.  Don't get me wrong, I liked this film it's just that I hardly think it deserves to be called a classic.  Jim Carrey gives one exceptional performance and it's always great to see Kirsten Dunst dancing around in her underwear. The sad fact is, when you think about it, they are doomed to repeat the misery they just tried to erase.  I know that's precisely the point but it's still cruel none-the-less.  I'm glad they decided to give Kate Winslett's character the crazy hair colors because it was easier to track the progression of time through Jim's mind.

The Last Samurai," Brainless (SPOILERS)
","SPOILERS.................... Tom Cruise stars, though one could easily imagine the movie built around Jean-Claude Van Damme. The actor gives his flattest performance in years as a one-time Union hero who, in the film's early innings, inexplicably has turned to a life as an alcoholic sideshow performer. Despite the sorry state of his life, Cruise's character is the first guy the US government looks to when a lucrative arms deal with Japan presents itself. Please don't plan on using your brain if you are going to try and enjoy this flick. Now, in order to enjoy a film like this, you have to let several things go. First, that Algren, who has spent a considerable amount of time in the bottom of a bottle, could not only take on several samurai at once, but actually survive for more than a millisecond in order to be taken captive. Second, that in the six months of his captivity, he could go from all-American rifleman to Bruce Lee as far as martial arts are concerned. Finally, that almost everyone speaks English.

Les Misérables," I never liked musicals... until now! What an AMAZING and MOVING film!
","First, I have to confess that the only knowledge I had of this legendary tale came through popular culture references. If it wasn't for Star Trek or Seinfeld episodes, I would have known absolutely nothing about Les Miserables. Yeah, I'm THAT guy. I can also say that I never met a musical that I liked or even wanted to give much of a chance. That changes in a BIG way here! I was completely enthralled and completely moved by this film and the way it was presented. I've read the critiques stating that the direction may be inferior or that the vocals should have been sweetened in post but I find both those criticisms to be without merit whatsoever. The entire cast was superb and there really are some award-worthy performances to say the least. Hugh Jackman is amazing as is Anne Hathaway (although being a novice to the tale, I was surprised at how small her role was). Every actor struck a chord with me emotionally. I honestly didn't expect that to happen. Sure, a person can nitpick the story and the rather instantaneous love and connections that happen between characters but why seek to cheapen the experience? Getting hung up on logic when everyone is singing their thoughts and feeling would be missing the point. The overall message is as grand and moving as the performances. I also have to finish with another confession. It takes a tougher man than I to not tear up at the end of the film. The conclusion hit home in a big way with me as did this film, much to my surprise.(Note: I usually consider myself in the 'it's not my kind of thing' category when it comes to musicals. I saw it because of the hype. Five minutes in when Crowe and Jackman are doing their opening sing/speak I thought to myself, 'good lord, this is going to be intolerable.' 'Why the heck did I pay to see this?' Now, I'm so glad I kept an open mind and allowed the film to do it's thing. This is one of the few 10/10 ratings and experiences for me of the 2012 releases. I enjoyed it FAR more than I thought I would.)",Null,1,4,4 January 2013
The Matrix Reloaded," Reloaded was dull & incoherent
","Reloaded pretended to be smart and philosophical by over-dressing it with obscure references to 'choice' and 'destiny' (oh the clichés), but ultimately there was no thought put into the writing. Even the fight scenes were on the weak and flimsy side. The entire movie lacked the energy of the original. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma, and there was no character development at all. Since the movie put way too much emphasis on the characters, this was a serious problem. This film had some nice effects that quickly became boring as the setup and execution lacked any tension.  The plot had no cohesion making it difficult for many in the audience to get caught up in the film. I found myself trying hard to like the film but failing miserably. Despite the number of effects, they were very ho-hum as if I was watching a FX reel and many of the best effects had already been revealed in the preview trailer. The opening ecstasy/rave sequence and the french guy/Monica Belucci scenes were particularly ridiculous. I may have over-generous with my 3 out of 10 rating.",Null,1,2,7 August 2003
Mystic River," Overrated Mess of a Movie
","`God was watching me but He wasn't angry.  It was more like looking down at a puppy who had soiled the carpet.' Sean Penn's character says this in `Mystic River' right before yet another horrific act is committed. Clint Eastwood must have put that line in to this movie himself in reference to his production of this twisted tale from the wrong side of the fence.  Clint must have had this same dirty, guilty feeling during filming.  If this bizarre neighborhood is any true indication of the Boston area then it's no wonder that God has cursed the Red Sox.  Why the need to go out of the way to show one of the two kidnappers as wearing a ring with a Christian symbol? Who does this movie appeal to?  I take great offense when Hollywood portrays the death of a nineteen-year-old as a reason to base a movie solely for the emotional baggage it brings to a film. There was nothing redeeming about this film and it sure wasn't escapist entertainment. Again I ask, whom does this movie appeal to?",Null,17,28,6 April 2004

Or is it Laurence Fishburne, who does such a killer Lou Rawls-style self-assured turn that he literally glides through his scenes? Or is it Marcia Gay Harden, whose gaping mouth and wide eye stare recall a fish on ice? There wasn't any real emotional substance to this film, whatsoever.

","There's no doubt about it; this is flat out a well-constructed and a riveting procedural drama. I love the fact that it really is ambiguous and doesn't even try and send any sort of over-the-top political message. It also tackles the subject matter in a serious and proper way. Opening on a black screen and hearing a sample of 9/11 but seeing nothing is exactly the right way to start the film. Closing the way they did by not 'spiking the football' or showing any American celebration was also the right move in my opinion. We all know the images from those two events. They are not needed. There's enough emotion to carry what was depicted as is. Jessica Chastain is amazing as the lead and now I understand her Oscar nomination. It's well deserved. The torture issue is clearly depicted for what it is and the viewer can make up their own mind about how effective it was and could be in the war on terror. The movie does a fine job of saying how things changed over the years but does so with a boots on the ground approach. Again, great choices and handled so very well.A remarkable movie any way you cut it.",Null,7,14,15 January 2013
Man on Fire," THE worst movie I have seen this year
",Man on Fire was edited like a two and a half our long trailer. There is no doubt it induced at least 100 seizures with its ungodly excess of cuts. The makers miserably failed in copying such fatastic films as City of god and Ammores Perros with its documentary style hand held camera work. This style did not gel with the story. The movie attempted to be Mel Gibson's Ransom and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Collateral Damage at the same time. The contrast was so apparent that the movie could have easily been split into two equally turd-like motion pictures. I can accept that some people may have enjoyed this 'movie' but it is not acceptable for me to betray my movie-going honor by saying Man on Fire had potential. The actinf talent was there but I refuse to say this alone makes a decent movie. Every other aspect was beyond repair. Please save your time and money.,Null,13,29,29 April 2004
Inception," Not as great as all the hype but an entertaining film to say the least
","I tried not to let the preposterous build up and hype for this movie influence me before I watched it. I'm glad that I did that because my expectations really weren't that high. As a result, I enjoyed this film quite a bit. I'm not sure about its 'rewatchability' but it certainly keeps you interested throughout. It's captivating on two fronts. One, the story itself and two, the fear that there's something else going on and that the 'other shoe' could drop at any minute. Nolan plays it masterfully. There were shortcomings for me, however. Minor inconsistencies (falling 'kicks' were happening every five seconds) and shifting between dream world and movie world time frames made it awkward at times. Also, the action sequences featured that poor shaky cam quality that I've really come to loathe. There was even some poor use of the steady cam on regular shots. Minor quibbles aside; I loved the theme they tackled and the trippy nature of the film itself. Anyone that has lost someone close to them knows the frustration of trying to keep a firm memory and those little nuances of them alive. For me, the bizarre concept and why they can even do what they do is secondary. What carries the film are great performances mixed with an emotional impact mixed with its unique plot angle. While not THE greatest thing ever put to film as some may suggest, it certain was an entertaining film to say the least.",Null,4,7,17 July 2010
Wonder Woman," Copies BETTER Movies but it's not bad... a shock for a DCEU film
","I found this effort to be quite entertaining despite being unoriginal. It is interesting to break down the overall tones of the film itself because although predictable throughout, it manages to craft enough of its own spin. It really is entirely cobbled together using VERY familiar elements that we've already seen. I know her source material originated first but the movie borrows heavily from familiar narratives. The movie IS a mix/copy of Captain America: The First Avenger (HEAVILY), Thor (mythology/powers), the Hogan's Heroes TV show and a CGI video game boss battle cut scene. It's the last two elements that seriously detract from the overall rating. The conclusion literally played out like a cartoon and not a very good one. Also, the infiltration of the German party played out very 'sitcomish' complete with everyone speaking English. Still, Gal Gadot captivated me as Wonder Woman and Chris Pine was amazing as Steve. They both elevate the overall material to be honest.Moving forward, the DCEU would be smart to focus more on Wonder Woman and less on the garbage we've already seen. The only negative I see is that they made her overwhelmingly powerful. That can be a huge problem in the future not only when facing enemies but with consistency. Even in this film it was all over the place in terms of her power. One scene she is straining to lift her own body weight and the next she literally lifts a tank over her head.",Null,0,6,2 June 2017

(Example: Die Hard 2) If they are going to miss, I'm glad they didn't miss with silly cartoon action. The story sets up fine and I appreciated the extra exposition and look in to the character's lives. It certainly does respect the first films. In fact, it feels like Taken 1.5 as a toned down extension or extended cut footage version from the first film. A lot of the time, those cut footage scenes are cut for a reason.

The Wolverine," An Exceptional Film On Every Level!
","I just loved The Wolverine. I thought it was very well written and the impressive cast really delivered! Hugh Jackman finally gets a full film to bring the character to the next level. It's been delivered in flashes before but this entire movie is the Wolverine that I wanted to see. This is the character that I grew up with and have enjoyed since youth. Mangold should be commended for giving the film a subdued yet intense flavor. I think they captured the vibe of the classic Japanese story from the books wonderfully. They delivered an intelligent plot that featured the fantastic grounded in a believable reality. One of the difficulties with the character is placing him in situations where he is in true danger. That wasn't an issue here as they managed to intelligently do this on numerous occasions in a smart fashion. I was very impressed with the many great moments and fine character arcs in this one. The action is dark, perfectly suiting the character and the PG-13 rating was pushed right to the edge if not beyond it.I disagree with those that say the villains are poorly utilized. Viper may have been one dimensional but I consider her a throw away tool when the entire plot is taken in to consideration. Yashida was perfectly utilized and his actions not only drive the film but flesh out everyone's motivations perfectly. Shingen was everything the character needed to be.The true strength in the supporting cast is both Mariko and Yukio. Amazing renditions both.That bullet train scene DID live up to the hype.

The Dark Knight Rises," A Very Mediocre Film, Period
","Whatever pre-judgments I had made about this film I checked at the door and watched it in hopes of enjoying a great film. Unfortunately, most will agree with me and admit this is not a great movie. The positive is that the storytelling is excellent and it does tie together the entire trilogy nicely. The emotion is there at times, especially every scene with Alfred.Still, that merging of all three films is also a negative. Using past development and arcs doesn't bother me at all. If you didn't see the other films then you have no business expecting to enjoy this film on a high level. What does bother me is that everything seemed telegraphed and that's just weak writing in my opinion. The logic flaws about Bane's whole master plan and how it was executed are blatant. What also detracts from the film for me is the fact that Batman does NOTHING but ride his bike once and get his ass kicked real bad for the first two hours of the film. Even after that, there are no action sequences or scenes of merit. It seems the idea was to make Batman the least appealing character on display (having him do little or nothing for the entire film) and making the movie about Bruce Wayne. Great artistic concept but it comes across as weak.Even though TDKR is filled with logic flaws, the 'surpise twists' are easy to spot and it's thematically over-ambitious, I still found myself interested in the story. Not a bad film by any stretch but unless you're a big fan going in I don't see how anyone will call this anything but mediocre to solid.",Null,4,10,20 July 2012
X2: X-Men United," Outstanding Movie - Best Sequel Since Godfather II
","It's not just that this movie, directed by Bryan Singer, is more chockablock with eye-popping effects and thrilling action sequences than the first one, though that's true. Nor that Singer depicts more mutant super-powers, though that's true also. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here, unlike in the original film. That 2000 release felt cramped and crabbed by comparison - so much exposition and backstory were required to introduce these characters and their universe that the plot couldn't start moving until the final half-hour. 'X2' starts fast, and springboards from the long-running Marvel Comics series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with the phrase 'summer movie.' For good reason, we equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action. But the writers here seem less interested in the action than the subtext: the effort by a high-handed majority to control and eradicate a minority it finds undesirable. The script examines the other side of that equation as well: the desire to strike back, to return hatred for hatred. In that sense, Stryker is the flip-side of Magneto, who believes that the mutants, rather than submit to discrimination or attempt peaceful coexistence, should use their powers to rise up and rule over humans. Not that this is a movie with a lot of touchy-feely talks about brotherhood. It's just that 'X2' has more on its mind than super-powered butt-kicking. Still, there's no denying that those super-powers drive this film. This is what state-of-the-art special effects look like: the live-action version of the way comic books appear in your mind. That would be irrelevant, however, without a good story. But 'X2''s script delivers, skillfully weaving together character, plot and action - and the action is more coherent and just plain spectacular.",Null,0,0,3 September 2003
