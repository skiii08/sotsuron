The Blair Witch Project," Is it over yet?
","I'm not a horror fan so I won't complain about the lack of gore but I couldn't wait for this movie to be over.  The acting wasn't bad but this is a low budget film and it looked it. Once the kids went into the woods it was just the same thing over and over. At the theater I was at, people actually got up and walked out.  I went relying on reviews and the '93' rating. I should have read the other user reviews.  If you must see this movie, I would advise waiting for the video.",3,0,1,7 August 1999
