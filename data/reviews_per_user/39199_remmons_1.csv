First Man," Morose astronauts shot with a home movie camera
","The astronauts are morose, always seeming to expect disaster. These are not the kind of people who sign up for a trip to the moon. They would be daunted by a car ride to Poughkeepsie. People who volunteer to fly a rocket to the Moon and back display confidence, even bravado, even when they might not feel it.The cinematography is on the level of a home movie. I understand that this may be an artistic choice, rather than incompetence. In that case, it was an awful choice in my opinion. The camera pans from one view to another in the manner of a poorly shot home movie, more likely to produce dizziness than artistic appreciation. The shots are poorly framed, often shot to close.The audio was horrendous, although this could be the fault of the theater in which I, sadly wasted my money to see this film. The sound effects, like the rocket at blast off, were too loud, while the dialogue was to low making it difficult to understand.My advice is: stream 'The Right Stuff' from Amazon.",4,14,24,19 October 2018
