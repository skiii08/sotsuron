Your Name.," Amazing concept and story but...
","75/100 Your Name will keep you on your toes and holding your breath for most of its runtime. The story is an incredible sci-fi with a lot of heart. One will get confused and desperate to figure out things around an hour in, and will root for someone's survival so much near the end! I do think however that the story didn't really write BOTH characters well that a romance and a romantic ending was justified. Mitsuha was clearly attracted to someone else for most of that film.",Null,1,1,16 April 2017
Get Out," Incredibly entertaining, incredible satire!!!
","Being a fan of Jordan Peele from Key & Peele, I came to the movie knowing his comedic and satirical chops, and his directorial debut definitely doesn't disappoint. I am rarely a fan of horror, but when horror is used how it should be - to magnify real societal wounds and inequalities — then I become the biggest fan. Hollywood horror films nowadays are jump scares, cash cows and unnecessary violence and gore without realistic characters. Get Out stands out among a handful others recently to really use the genre well.",Null,23,51,15 March 2017
War Machine," can't make up its own mind
","War Machine is a film that starts out as a promising satire, but quickly tone-shifts and tries to be something else. These shifts keep happening several times as the film progresses. It wants to criticize the US government's counterinsurgent efforts in Afghanistan through Brad Pitt's General Glen McMahon, but then wants to keep him sympathetic and wants the audience to care when he's sad or feeling hopeless. Those bits certainly don't work with Brad Pitt's performance, who is great as the General only if satirical, but just for that. David Michôd certainly has the right intentions and grasp on his subject matter, but couldn't quite translate those into a consistent film.",Null,8,15,27 May 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Do yourself a favor and just watch the animated version again
","It's incredible how lifeless this live-action adaptation (with real, breathing humans) is compared to the 1991 animated version. The efforts to make the love story more believable were appreciated, but still fell way short and the effort was barely there in terms of writing and acting. The visuals were unimpressive at the least to downright ugly in some. (A simple example would be the rose, just sadly trapped in glass, not even glowing. Lifeless.) The musical pieces were bland, nothing really special, like the commitment was just halfway, just something they had to do. (Be Our Guest was especially disappointing: badly designed, choreographed and directed that really, you would beg to just watch the animated version again instead.) I would've cut some of those additional songs as well. The singing, except for 6-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald, was mediocre. Autotune was definitely used for a lot of them, but you can especially tell with lead Emma Watson. The acting was also all over the place. Out of the actors we see on screen, only Luke Evans really commits to his role, his best moments being in the first half of the movie. Dan Stevens' performance is hard to decipher, since his voice was heavily edited for Beast, and his face is completely CGI. Also eye roll-worthy were the fake French accents some voice actors had to use while others retain their own English accents, and Mrs. Potts voiced by Emma Thompson had a cockney accent. Remember that everyone is in France anyway. Either hire French actors or just drop the 'accent' entirely. This movie was nothing but a complete cash grab for Disney, and the box office numbers will unfortunately let them keep making movies this empty.",Null,37,74,19 March 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Enjoyable
","Definitely one of the better blockbusters in recent times, with lots of recognizable actors that you'll find yourself hoping their characters won't die, which adds to the thrill. Samuel Jackson is of course solid, and infuriating near the end. Brie Larson was nice and believable. Tom Hiddleston doesn't really have the kind of presence that an actor in this type of movie should be having (he tries and he fails IMO). Straight Outta Compton actors Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell are good to see here. Corey Hawkins as a nerdy scientist alongside Jing Tian was a pleasure to see. John C. Reilly's character propels most of the movie. There was a lot of use of colored smoke which made for gorgeous shots, so I'm not really complaining. I appreciated the fact that the actors of color weren't just merely hired so they can claim 'diversity', but gave them good roles, lines, and didn't kill them off. I also appreciated that the people in the island weren't painted as uncivilized or 'savages', the way these type of films usually do. However, it feels off that they never even developed any form of language besides staring really long into each others' eyes and bowing. The villainous monster design was good, and was a great contrast to Kong. Kong as a character and a creature was definitely more regal, and is further on the evolutionary process (i.e. walks upright and uses and builds tools).",Null,1,3,12 March 2017
