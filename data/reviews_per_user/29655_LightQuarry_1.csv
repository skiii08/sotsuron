Blade Runner 2049," Androids dream of electric sheep
","You have no recollection of how long you've been standing there. You just know that it's raining and that you are staring at a white wall. The wall stretches out as far as your eyes can see. Sniffing the air, you instinctively reach out and touch the wall. As you expected, the paint is wet. The rain is just a light drizzle, but enough to make sure the paint will take forever to dry.That's exactly how slow Blade Runner 2049 is.Yet it is magnificent. Every scene, every second, every frame and every square inch of the picture is pure cinematic perfection. Sound and vision build a seamless and timeless experience of epic proportions.By the time the 164 minutes are over, you wish it would last for another 6 hours.That's exactly how good it is.Do androids dream of electric sheep? I think they do.",9,2,15,5 January 2019
