The Monuments Men," Entertaining, not deep or significant, just entertaining
","Normally I don't care for the smug 'war can be fun' movies, like the silly 'Kelley's Heroes' or the disgusting 'Mash' films. But this one was actually pretty good. Not too violent (well at least by today's standards), dramatic in parts, funny in many, tragic in a few, sort of a movie vaudeville show. Sure the actors are all mostly too old for their parts, and yes, they portray the monuments men as stereotypical nerds, but they are entertaining nerds. So if you are looking for an exact retelling of historical events, try the Military or the History Channel. But for just some escapist diversion, this movie will fill your needs.",8,5,9,10 February 2014
Midnight in Paris," Ho-Hum
","Had 'Midnight in Paris' been written/directed by a first-time film maker, it might be considered an above average effort, or at least a pleasant diversion. But as Woody Allen has such a large body of work this film comes off as typical Woody Allen fare,slow, clichéd, and rife with light (and I'm talking' light!) humor.All of Mr.Allen's prejudices are exposed once again:His disdain for California and Hollywood, though he is quite happy to take advantage of their financial backing and distribution network; his attitude that all Americans are rubes and stupid, except of course for New York City Jews, and Manhattan gentiles; Oh how much he wishes America was like France, and their 'sophistication'; they might even accept a grown man marrying his adopted daughter!In the mean time, Mr.Allen has written a tired old movie, with a comparatively new actor (Owen Wilson) pretending to be Woody himself.Don't waste your time.",3,7,12,12 March 2012
Gone Girl," Clever, and an exception to the rule
","There is a saying in stand-up comedy that says 'if you don't buy the premise, you won't buy the joke.' So if a person can't accept that a horse or penguin can walk and talk in a bar, the ensuing joke won't get a laugh. The same concept also applies to movies. If the plot or characters are so unbelievable, the whole movie will fail. But then there are exceptions; like Gone Girl. Sure the movie starts out with the stock characters. The one's the viewer is supposed to think are so sophisticated and witty, but are actually the one's that in real life you would think were obnoxious and snarky. But then the plots thickens, and goes on such a joyride of overkill, over-the-top situations, and an evil genius worthy of Lex Luther or the joker. But damn, the ridiculousness is done so well that you will be entertained, even after the two hour mark.",7,1,9,28 October 2014
Crazy Heart," Realism? Ha! Who needs it!
","To review this film, I have the following questions: The 'love of his life' flies to Houston from New Mexico to see him. She arrives at his house by taxi.Q:what kind of a guy in love does not pick up his main squeeze at the airport? Blake crashes his 31 year old GMC, rolls it over, and suddenly it is back in primo condition a couple of weeks later. Q: if he is so 'down on his luck' where did he get the money torestore it? If he had full insurance, the insurance company would total it, and give him a couple of hundred bucks.Jean is a reporter for a newspaper. She meets Blake, and a couple of interviews later, she is sleeping with him. Q: does this add to her creditability as a news reporter? Most news outlets would fire her, or at least cancel her project.Come to think of it, what does she see in this old, ugly, drunk anyway?The film makers appear to be cynical enough to think that C+W fans will like the music, and ignore the plot, and the 'chick-flick' (sorry about the characterization) crowd will just care about the cliché and predictable love story. Unfortunately, many viewers do not fit in either group",Null,0,2,15 August 2011
Cloud Atlas," A 3+ hour mish mash of clichés, pretentiousness, and yawn
","I am not afraid of long movies. GWTW, Greed,1950 style epics, all I have sat through at one sitting. But this is not any of those, not even close. It is another one of those 'look how clever I am' movies, coupled to a usual suspect plot. Who are the villains? Why White businessmen of course! Who are the good guys? Why homosexuals, minorities, and Luddites of course! Even though the heroes include a gay gold-digger, and a literary agent that happily cheats and robs all he comes into contact with. Maybe with a 4+ hour movie, they could have added a Stalinist Gulag guard as another hero. So unless your idea of entertainment is watching a politically correct salute to high school level leftism for three hours, skip this.",2,3,8,27 May 2013
