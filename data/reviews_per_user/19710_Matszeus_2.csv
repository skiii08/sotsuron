Resident Evil: Afterlife," Where should i start....
","Wow..just wow the people that wrote and directed this garbage should be incarcerated to a cell with soft walls, I mean just look at the start of the movie when 'Alice' is attacking the Umbrella corp headquarters...I've seen bad movies but this is sad, the potential for making a good Resident evil movie must be out there, I mean is Capcom happy with this piece of poo? Or just ***** some American *****.You can watch it and decide for yourself.It blew the blow out of gundpowder that smokes the wack out of crack...please don't come back.",2,1,5,7 January 2015
2012," They did not think this thru at all
","Well I agree with a lot of people, it's like they made it for the tension, but they overdid it totally, can a person really have that much luck driving a car thru a earthquake must almost be impossible just to hold the car straight but they sure dodge everything. And the part where the airplane actually goes into the the cindercluster cloud which actually would choke the engines, and burn the airplane to the ground. The forces thats just created from the blasts from a super volcano would reach such a velocity that would make a tornado F5 look like a swat from a fly swat. But it would be nice to hear what other people like about it and their point of views.",3,4,7,14 November 2009
