Miracle," minnesota and boston kids beat Hockey Superchamp
","(I don't think there are any spoilers but jsut in case... possible)
mm How do I start this one off.. I LOVED it!! The intensity is that of an actual game (& can only imagine dressing room) That's how caught up I got in the movie. it was like you were right in there with them. not to mention that at times you almost jumped right out of your seat for a goal as well as heard a few people make a groan when something went bad. Would swear  Stan Fischler was in the movie  (i thought I saw him in the stands, but its quick) and OMG!!!  to those Seriously  into hockey or other than NHL, you may reconize one of the 'Russian' players. (not by name. but by face, esp. those that are AHL Albany River Rats & NHL New Jersey Devil Fans.) Player #13  Mikhalov (something like that) but LOL I actually met an 'actor' LOL Totally got a kick out of that one! no matter how many times they showed him, I wouldn't believe my eyes.  at the end there's a longer look at him, but still waited for the credits to make sure I wasn't having my head messed with. There's also a couple of commercials I remember from when I was a kid (esp. a certain football one) The cameos were cool. (I reconized some but couldn't place a name on them.) Other than Mel Gibson, the only actor I know of is the McClanahan (?) guy who was in the movie Bring It On!  (who in the trailer I thought was Rick DiPietro!of the NY Islanders LOL)Only thing is I feel bad the Real Brooks didn't get to see it, but I'm sure would be proud of it. Don't know how many movies I gave this to but.....  A+   (actually that shuld be a grade less than what I made LOTR:ROTK  so the actuall gradei'd give would be an   AA+  if that's possible  (and a  10 on the vote ballot)",9,0,0,3 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Actors said it was good and that it WAS! Is there a bestter grade than an A+? How about a TRIPLE A?
","Two reasons I went to see this in the theater this time; 1. waited for the other 2 on dvd, being so long & so i braved the 3+ hours because 2.  the Actors said it was the best of the 3.and that it was the best of the three! This installment has pretty much all of the movie genres in one! There's more drama, a little horror  (the spider and aragorn sees dead people) and this one has definately more humor than the first two put together! also this one was alot more emotional. Right when you're up, next scene might be a little down.  Cheers galore throught the  movie from my viewing room. Only one problem.... DON'T get any drink from the snack bar!For the girls that ONLY go to the movie to see Orlando Bloom... he's not in this one as much as the Two Towers. but still has a cool part. and the end definately makes it worth not seeing him as much through the movie.my grade?.. mm is there anything better than an   A+ ?  maybe a triple A ?my only thing is.. bring your own porta pottie!
