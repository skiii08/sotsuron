The Avengers," Avengers: An Assembly of Sheer Awesomeness!!!
","From the moment Samuel L Jackson walked in during the post-credits scene of 'Iron Man' four years ago, talking about the 'Avengers Initiative', the whole world has waited for this epic assemblage of some of Marvel's greatest icons! Well, four years and five films later, the Avengers have finally assembled...and, as expected, it was with a wave of sheer awesomeness!Unlike the previous 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' films, 'The Avengers' isn't really into complex plotting here. The premise is simple-Loki, the Asgardian 'God', seeks to facilitate the invasion of Earth by an alien race...and Nick Fury, Director of SHIELD, responds by activating the 'Avengers Initiative', bringing together armored hero Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. reprising the character for the third time), Loki's 'brother' and Asgardian warrior Thor (Chris Helmsworth), the living legend and man out of time Captain America (Chris Evans), gamma radiations expert Dr. Bruce Banner and his monstrous alter ego the 'Hulk' (both played to perfection by Mark Ruffalo, following in the footsteps of Edward Norton) and clandestine operatives Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). What follows is the usual hero vs. villain fare...albeit on a scale about a BILLION times larger than that of, say, 'Spiderman'. Indeed, one of the greatest moments in the film is a single shot that sweeps across New York City, taken in the battles of each of the six Avengers across the breadth of the Big Apple...a testament to the sheer scale and scope of not only the film itself, but the threat faced by the heroes in-universe.Action and spectacles aside, 'The Avengers' real strength lies in the characterizations of the core characters. Downey Jr. turns in another memorable performance as Tony Stark which was to be expected, and Tom Hiddleton brilliantly essays the megalomaniacal God Loki...but it is newcomer (to the Marvel movie-verse) Mark Ruffalo who really stands out in his dual performance as both scientific genius Bruce Banner and the rampaging Hulk. Ruffalo brings a level of depth to the character, and his inner struggles, which was not immediately evident in performances by previous actors. His Banner is not so much a man on the run from the monster within as he is a man who is starting to learn to accept the monster and use it as a force for good. Samuel L Jackson really gets to shine here as Nick Fury, after his cameos in previous films.On a parting note, there has been an unfortunate tendency, for months, on message boards, blogs and forums across the Internet, to create some kind of a 'competition' between The Avengers and Nolan's upcoming epic, The Dark Knight Rises. Having seen the former, I can safely say that such comparisons are totally uncalled for. The Avengers is not aiming to surpass The Dark Knight Rises any more than Star Wars was aiming to surpass The Godfather. They are two totally different films, belonging to different genres and (literally) whole different universes, and as fans, we need to respect that above all else and enjoy all masterpieces on their own merits!",10,37,70,27 April 2012
The Incredible Hulk," A Giant Leap Towards Success
","In the 1960's, a genius named Stan Lee, created for a company named Marvel Comics, an entire stable of characters who were unique and exuded originality in many aspects, including their characterization, their abilities and the style of storytelling of their adventures. Each and every one of his creations was in some way the a brand new innovation. Spiderman, the Fantastic Four, the X-men, Iron Man, Daredevil, Thor and of course, the Hulk. Owing to the worldwide success of the first Spider-Man film in 2002, Marvel has since sought to recreate all of Stan Lee's characters for the big screen and reinvent and reinterpret them for modern audiences. Their most recent and ambitious attempt at this has been with the creation of their own studios, Marvel Studios which will produce several films featuring various Marvel characters, set in a common continuity, so that the characters may interact in a future crossover film. The Incredible Hulk is the second film to be released as part of this ambitious project and following on the heels of the highly successful Iron Man, it has certainly done pretty well commercially and even critically, though probably not as much as its producers would have liked. Though the Incredible Hulk is a reboot of the short-lived Hulk movie franchise (which began and ended with the 2003 Hulk film), it does not retread the plot of the previous film by retelling the characters tragic origin story...rather it has the unique quality of reinventing the character and reintroducing him to the audiences while at the same time taking the character forward and presenting new material to viewers who have seen the previous film. The story revolves around Bruce Banner, who has been living with the curse of the gamma-charged monster called the Hulk for five years now. Banner, who is on the run from the US Military, led by General Ross, seeks a cure from his abnormal condition, with the help of his ex-girlfriend and his arch-Nemesis's daughter, Betty Ross. General Ross however is determined to capture the Green Goliath and to this end empowers a Special Forces veteran named Blonsky with the Super Soldier serum. However, Blonsky's lust for power results in his transformation into the all-powerful Abomination, whose rampage through the streets of New York City can only be stopped by the Hulk! It is this no holds barred fight scene which is truly the climatic moment of this film. Edward Norton does a brilliant job portraying Bruce Banner as the scientist and fugitive tormented by his brutal alter ego, while Liz Tyler plays the part of the faithful girlfriend and companion to perfection. Ultimately, this film has given the Hulk the momentum to make a giant leap towards future success...it remains to be seen if the producers enable him to actually make that leap...",8,3,5,2 May 2009
Skyfall," A Golden Bond for the Golden Jubilee!!!
","Fifty years ago, Sean Connery first walked onto screen as the suave and sophisticated secret agent, James Bond, 007-looking dapper in his tuxedos, swilling down his vodka martinis 'shaken not stirred', bedding a bevy of alluring women and dispatching England's enemies with cold dispassion. In the decades since, 007 has taken on spies and counter- spies, crime lords, nefarious international organizations, and megalomaniacs who seek to destroy the world! But the 50th anniversary outing, 'Skyfall', isn't about any of that. Well, actually, it DOES touch upon those iconic elements, and many others, but above all, it is an insightful piece of self-introspection by the franchise about its lead character and his relevance in contemporary society.'Redundancy' and 'resurrection' are the twin themes that drive the narrative of this film, as Bond, M, and the very concept of intelligence agencies are all deconstructed and deemed to be redundant. 'Skyfall' is thus the story of their resurrection, as they rise from the ashes to meet the seemingly insurmountable challenges that face them and persevere. Their antagonist, Silva, too has had a 'resurrection' of his own, albeit of a darker variety...Another underlying theme which the movie keeps returning to is the adage that often, the 'old ways are best'...a fitting meta-textual reference to the age-old traditions of the Bond franchise, many of which are revived for this installment. The conflict between old and new is best reflected in the banter between veteran field agent Bond and tech-whiz 'Q'...and much as the two learn to work together through the course of the film, the old and new seamlessly merge together in this film in the broader context of the franchise.Beyond the themes and sub-texts, the film boasts of some stunning locales-the scenes in Macau are virtually scenic pornography!-mind- blowing action sequences, and some good old fashioned dry humor. And of course, the brilliant performances by Javier Bardem (who's Silva owes as much inspiration to Heath Ledger's Joker as it does to classic Fleming- esque bad guys), Judi Dench (as masterfully imposing as ever in the character of M), Ben Whitshaw (a younger avatar of the beloved character Q), Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, and last but not the least, Daniel Craig. Craig has really come into his own as Bond now...no longer is the 'new' Bond...he IS Bond, pure and simple; ready to save the day for a few more thrilling cinematic escapades...Ultimately, 'Skyfall' is everything the 50th anniversary of any film franchise should be (not that there are any others that can boast of this distinction thus far!) Willing to respect the old while welcoming the new, it has brought the series full circle, figuratively AND even literally (as shall be evident to anyone who watches it)...reminding us not only of who Bond is, but why he has endured for five decades and will hopefully endure for several more to come!",10,4,20,2 November 2012
Iron Man 2," Doesn't exactly live up to expectations...but Great nonetheless!
","When Iron Man released in 2008 it was pretty much the Dark Horse of superhero films. No one really expected a film based on a character the general public knew next to nothing about to do really well, especially not in the same year as a certain film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring the late Heath Ledger was also due to be released. And yet the film was highly successful, critically and commercially, propelled Robert Downey Jr. to new heights of stardom and pretty much began the renaissance where Marvel superhero films were concerned. But perhaps one of the best things about the first film (apart from the well-structured plot, the excellent dialogue, the brilliant acting etc.) was the cliffhanger ending of Tony Stark revealing his identity as Iron Man to the world! RDJ's line 'I am Iron Man' plainly spoken in a matter-of-fact tone itself, perhaps more than anything else, set the momentum for the high expectations everyone had of the sequel. And the trailers, when they came, set expectations even higher...and then when the film came out...it didn't live up to a lot of those expectations. It certainly didn't live up to mine...But it was fun nonetheless!The film gives us everything we wanted and more. The dialogue is great (though not as good as the first), the action scenes and visual effects are truly awe-inspiring and even the themes and overall plot is pretty gripping! The theme of the movie is clearly legacy which refers not only to Howard Stark's legacy to Tony but also Tony's legacy of Iron Man to the world (and on a much narrower scale, to his friends Pepper Potts and Jim Rhodes). Many of the plot points, such as the US Government wanting the Iron Man technology, other villains getting their hands on the technology, Tony's struggles with leading a double life (though he doesn't really have a secret identity per se) etc. seem to be natural progressions from the first film. Some others like the Ivan Vanko revenge plot and the backstory involving Howard Stark and Anton Vanko do add greater depth to the film version of the Iron Man mythos (and the whole Legacy theme). Jim Rhodes becoming War Machine and using the Mark 2 armour as well is clearly the culmination of the foreshadowing from the scene in the first film ('next time baby') and the Natasha Romanov subplot was pretty interesting as well (not to mention the fight scenes).So what WAS this film missing then? Well for starters the plot just didn't flow as organically as it did with Iron Man 1. Of course its not as though this ruins the movie...its only a very subtle difference but it can be felt nonetheless. Case in point, Tony just has a drunken armour battle with Rhodes during his birthday party, blows up about half his house in the process and then...is sitting on a rooftop having donuts waiting for Nick Fury to show up! And Fury's involvement seemed kinda like a deux ex machina to cure Tony's condition and get him off the erratic behavior thats been plaguing him for most of the film and back into action for the final battle. Which brings us to the tone of the film. Iron Man 1, while it did have a fair share of humour, was largely pretty serious in its tone, even dark in some parts. Iron Man 2 was expected to be dark (most superhero sequels are) and one would expect that a film in which a major plot point is the protagonist slowly dying of blood poisoning would be exceedingly dark in its tone, but instead Iron Man 2 has MORE than its fair share of humour (so much so that the last scene itself was more of a joke than anything else). Even Pepper and Tony arguing over his not telling her about his condition was made humorous, whereas it should have been a touching emotional moment. Nonetheless, these issues thankfully do not detract THAT much from an otherwise excellent film though Iron Man 2 could have easily surpassed the original had the afforementioned shortcomings not been present.That said, I must comment on the whole 'Avengers Initiative' subplot that has slowly been building up over the course of multiple Marvel Studios films that is clearly leading up to the much awaited Avengers film. With this film, I get the feeling that things are clearly escalating on that front as compared to Iron Man 1 and The Incredible Hulk with characteristics of the 'shared universe' becoming glaringly apparent and not so subtle anymore. Nick Fury and SHIELD playing a significant role in the film, Captain America's shield making a clear appearance, the scene with Thor's hammer after the credits, the Avengers Initiative folder etc. seems to be making the notion that Iron Man isn't the only superhero in the world a bit too obvious. It seems now that Marvel is committed to this whole 'Avengers' film project so hopefully they'll see it through without any major hiccups.",10,2,5,8 May 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," 'Become the animal...embrace the other side...'
","Most people know him as the most popular member of the X-men, the 'brand ambassador' of the franchise in a manner of speaking. But in many ways, Wolverine has surpassed the X-men to become an iconic legend in his own right. And after facilitating three cinematic outings for the ferocious mutant with adamantium claws along with his fellow teammates, 20th century Fox has now finally decided to give the character his own film and unveil to the wider world one of the most intriguing stories of all time: the true origins of Wolverine.The story of the man who would become Wolverine begins on an estate in Canada in 1845, when James, the son of a wealthy landowner, witnesses the brutal murder of his father at the hand's of his groundskeeper Thomas Logan, and learns much to his horror, that Logan is his true father. Killing Logan in a fit of the berzeker rage that would later become his trademark, using his newly manifested bone claws, young James flees the estate with his half-brother, Victor. Over the next century and beyond, James (now assuming the name of his true father, Logan) and Victor lend their services to the US Army in the Civil War, the World Wars and the Vietnam War (all depicted in a spectacular opening sequence), using their mutant abilities to survive and ensure their longetivity. However, their special gifts have not been entirely overlooked for during Vietnam, they are both recruited by Major William Stryker for a special forces team consisting of mutants, including the superhumanly strong Fred Dukes, the expert marksman and gymnast Agent Zero, the teleporter John Wraith, the technopath Chris Bradly and the sword wielding 'perfect soldier', Wade Wilson. However, after realising that his teammates are willing to kill innocents indiscriminately and realising the extent of his brothers homicidal tendencies, Logan abandons the team.Six years later, it seems that Logan has finally found peace in the arms of his lover, Kayla. But the shadows of his past return to haunt him when Kayla is seemingly killed by Victor, leading Logan to seek vengeance. Needing an edge over his nemesis, Logan rejoins Stryker and volunteers to undergo the adamantium bonding procedure and become 'Weapon X'. But on realising Strykers true agenda, Logan breaks lose and escapes, setting out to hunt down not only Victor, but Stryker as well.The special effects and stunts are truly breath-taking, if somewhat stylized compared to previous entries in the franchise. Wolverine's battles with Sabertooth (Victor), Gambit and Deadpool are brilliant visual spectacles. The plot is pretty okay as well; its a bit rushed and quite a few liberties have been taking with the source material, but considering that the idea is to recapture the spirit of the character and considering that the said source material is 15-20 years worth of contradictory stories, they do a pretty good job. But the real cake goes to the performances. Hugh Jackman does a brilliant job as Wolverine, as always, though of course, this time he portrays aspects of the character never seen before on screen. The important thing to understand about Wolverine is that hes not a superhero; hes a wild, dangerous, anti-hero, a vengeful and unbalanced killing machine. And yet he has a soul, he has the ruins of a conscience, which is something Sabertooth clearly lacks, as evident by his shock and disgust on learning that Stryker is experimenting on innocent young mutants. Liev Schreiber plays Victor Creed/Sabertooth (though he isn't named as such in the film) as the animal that Logan/Wolverine doesn't become in spite of all he's been through. Danny Huston does a good job as William Stryker, the manipulative military scientist who seems to share an almost eerie father-son relationship with Logan. Lynn Collin does okay as Logan's one-time love Kayla and Taylor Kitcsh steals the stage from Jackman temporarily as the happy go lucky mutant gambler Remy LeBeau. Also notable is Tim Pocock for his role as a teenage Scott Summers, destined to become X-men leader Cyclops and Patrick Stewart (de-aged by CGI) as mutant visionary and X-men founder Charles Xavier in a small cameo role.Overall, Wolverine is the perfect origin story and action film both rolled into one for one of comicdom's legendary figures.",8,2,5,24 June 2009
X-Men," An X-cellent beginning, which led to bigger and better things
","'X-men' and its sequels have always been notable for standing out from other superhero films. The reason for this distinction probably lies in the universe the films portray, a pseudo-science fictional take on a 'near future' reality where a conflict is brewing between ordinary human beings and the people who are considered the next step in the evolution of man: mutants. The mutants are of course a metaphor for the discrimination rampant in the world on the basis of caste, creed, religion, gender and orientation. The X-men mythos simply puts a sci-fi spin on a real-world problem and takes it to a whole new level: discrimination on the basis of genetic makeup! Once you understand this to be the context of these films, you will realize exactly what sets the X-men apart from other superheroes. Mutants are not just people born with extraordinary and superhuman powers and abilities, they are also a minority fighting for their civil rights, hiding from a world which fears and often hates them. And as with any other minority in the world, there are two opposing factions among the mutants as well: the hardliners who wish to eliminate their opposition and thus spare their brethren from persecution; and the negotiators, who wish to resolve the conflict by means of peaceful negotiation and cooperation founded on mutual trust and benefits. In the film, the former camp is represented by Magneto (Ian McKellen) and his 'Brotherhood of Mutants'; the latter camp is represented by Proffesor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his X-men. The plot of the film itself is quite simple, and serves merely as an introduction to this dark world which shall be explored in greater scope in the next two films. The film, for the most part, follows the stories of two characters; Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), as they are drawn into the human-mutant conflict and find themselves, before long, at the centre of it. Wolverine, in particular, is a character who will be greatly explored in the sequels as well as in the upcoming prequel film. The other X-men are not particularly developed much, though the actors have done a pretty good job with their portrayal. Xavier and Magneto ultimately become seen more as representatives of their respective ideologies than characters in themselves; both are ultimately of the same type of personality-great leaders willing to spread their ideologies through the actions of their followers. So, while this film is certainly no where near as intricate and suspenseful as X2 or epic as the vastly under-rated X-men: The Last Stand, it is nevertheless an excellent prologue into an interesting sci-fi world which in many ways is a twisted reflection of our own.",10,0,1,27 April 2009
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Beyond James Bond...a Harsh Look at the REAL World of Spies...
","Expect none of the mind-numbing action of The Bourne Ultimatum, the exotic locales of Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, or the suavity, wit and charm of James Bond, Her Majesties' most renowned fictional secret agent. 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', adapted from John Le Carre's novel of the same name, offers a far more realistic and cynical look at the world of spies and international intrigue.The setting is London in the mid-1970's, in the midst of the Cold War. Retired spymaster George Smiley is called back into service for a crucial assignment-to identify the Soviet mole buried deep in the highest echelons of the British Intelligence organization known as the 'Circus'. What follows is two hours of spellbinding intrigue as Smiley uncovers layer after layer of omission and deception. Covert operations across the Iron Curtain, bureaucratic infighting and power struggles, and even infidelities and indiscretions are all but a few of the elements of this, one of Le Carre's most intricate plots.While the film is a very good adaptation of the novel, its treatment of the plot is overly complicated at times, and therefore, it may be on such occasions be mildly incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't read the novel. Where the film really stands out though, is in the performances of the actors. Gary Oldman delivers a masterful performance as George Smiley. Though Oldman's Smiley is far more dapper than the character described in the novel, he is still the 'anti-James Bond' in every sense - mild-mannered, soft-spoken, middle-aged and bespectacled, above all a thinking man rather than a man of violence. Tom Hardy and Mark Strong likewise deliver solid performances as field agents Ricky Tarr and Jim Prideux; the former being closest approximation this film offers to the glamorous, womanizing secret agent of the James Bond mold, and the latter being the very portrait of a burnt out and betrayed spy. Colin Firth also delivers a powerful performance as high-ranking Circus agent Bill Haydon. The creation of atmosphere is another one of the film's great assets-where the world of James Bond is defined by exotic locales, night clubs and casinos, prolonged chase sequences and fight scenes...Smiley's world is comprised of suffocating board rooms, secret archives, English country houses and even a school playground.'Tinker Tailor...' is first and foremost a cerebral film; and certainly not your destination for cinematic thrills. But it is undoubtedly an intellectual 'treat' to watch nonetheless...",10,1,3,16 April 2012
The Bourne Ultimatum," 'Someone started all of this, And I'm gonna find them'
","If there is one word third installment of the groundbreaking Bourne trilogy loosely based on the bestselling novels of renowned author Robert Ludlum its 'explosive'. The screen literally explodes to life with the movie beginning with an intense chase sequence. What follows is an array of mind-blowing chases, fights and explosions that will literally leave the viewer stunned in his seat. But great action alone is not what makes this movie a near-masterpiece; its the underlying plot and premise, and the enigma surrounding the protagonist and his search for his mysterious past is what really captivates the viewer. Very few thriller movies seek to tell a deeper story amidst all the fast-paced violence and action and many that try often fail, but the previous two Bourne films have already revolutionized the espionage thriller genre and this film proudly continues the trend. Matt Damon reprises his role as Jason Bourne, the amnesiac rogue CIA operative on the run from the people who made him what he was-the perfect killing machine, a lethal assassin who killed without mercy until he lost his memory and tried to regain his humanity with the help of the woman he loved. But his girlfriend, Marie, was killed as 'collateral damage' during his conflict with the CIA, who believes him to be a threat and a liability who needs to be eliminated. Bourne returned to the violent world of his past in order to avenge her death, and now, he finds he is left with only one purpose-to find the person who 'started it all', who molded him into the killer known as 'Jason Bourne'. From Moscow, to Paris, London, Madrid, Tangier and finally the streets of New York City, Bourne travels around the world, barely a few steps ahead of those hunting them, while pieces of the mystery surrounding the creation of the Bourne identity slowly and subtly fall into place. The action and excitement of the film culminates, relatively peacefully, with an encounter at the end of which Bourne finally knows all the answers. From an action point of view, the viewer is really spoilt for choice. Even a relatively minor scene like a violent encounter Bourne has with a few Russian policemen in the beginning is so expertly filmed in Paul Greengrass's gritty style that you really don't feel that its only a prologue to greater things to come. A notable highlight is the elaborate sequence in the Waterloo station. And then there is a rooftop chase in Tangier (which hearkens back to the 1987 Bond movie, The Living Daylights), and a car chase (similar to the one in The Bourne Supremacy) in New York, the last major action sequence of the film. Matt Damon of course does a brilliant job as Jason Bourne. Naturally, by this point hes had a lot of experience playing the amnesiac assassin, but in this film, Damon's acting, his speech and his body language really speaks volumes for how much the character has changed since the first film. With Marie dead, the Bourne's characters last link to humanity has been stripped away from him and he is now pretty much back to being the cold-blooded killing machine he must have been before the amnesia, except that this time hes targeting the people who created him. He speaks in a cold monotone for most of the time and yet conveys an intensity that can really send a chill down your spine. And yet, there is still a spark of humanity left in the emotionless machine, as we see in a crucial scene in the middle of the film, where a visibly distressed Bourne confesses how he is haunted by the faces of the men he killed in his forgotten past. We realize that the beneath the brutality and coldness is an ordinary human being with emotions and feelings struggling to break out and this makes us sympathize with the character further and become emotionally invested in his quest for the truth. Joan Allen turns in another excellent performance as CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy, Bourne's only ally in the Agency who is ethically opposed to the CIA's inhuman black ops programs and wishes to help Bourne as a means of redeeming herself and the Agency for all they've done to him.David Straithairn plays Noah Vosen, chief of the CIA black ops program codenamed 'Blackbriar', who considers it his mission to rid the world of threats to 'national security', threats which include Bourne and all those who support him. He proves to be the perfect antagonist to Landy in the bureaucratic corridors of power. Julia Stiles plays Nicky Parsons, a CIA employee and former contact of Bourne's from back during his days with the Agency. Stiles, who had a much lesser role in the previous two films, essentially plays the 'mystery woman' from Bourne's past-their previous relationship, if any, is subtly hinted at and largely left ambiguous. And finally, Albert Finney plays Dr. Albert Hirsch, the mastermind behind Blackbriar and the man who, in essence, 'created' the Bourne identity. Hirsch continues to appear throughout the film in Bourne's fragmented memories of his initial transformation into an assassin, and he is confronted by Jason in the end, revealing all the answers Bourne (and the viewer) have always wanted to know. In conclusion, I would like to comment on the last frame of the film which is essentially a homage to the first frame of The Bourne Identity-of the blackened outline of a man floating unconscious in the water. But someone who has seen the trilogy knows and appreciates how much the character has been through, how much he has changed in the years between those two frames, and we have the team at Universal and the cast and crew to thank for telling this most compelling cinematic saga of the 21st century.",10,1,3,13 May 2009
The Bourne Identity," A Killer of a Thriller Identified
","The Bourne Identity is an action-packed adaptation of renowned author Robert Ludlum's international bestseller of the same name. And it sure as hell isn't your average leave-your-brains behind thriller (which is sadly what many of the James Bond films had become). The plot is the primary focus of this film, which the mind-numbing action scenes, gloss and glamour taking only secondary precedence. The film begins with the unconscious body of a man (Matt Damon), with two bullets in his back, being hauled out of the Mediterranean Sea on a stormy night by the crew members of a fishing boat. When the unknown man regains consciousness, he realizes he has no memory of who he is or how he ended up in this predicament. The only clues to his past are a Swiss bank account number embedded in his hip and an in-depth knowledge of various European languages. The man embarks on a journey to discover his true identity. But the more he leanrs, the more questions arise. Who is Jason Bourne? How did he become a living breathing fighting machine? Why is he being hunted at every turn by the authorities and a mysterious group of assassins? Jason must use every skill he has acquired in an unremembered life to survive, answer these questions, and uncover the secrets behind the 'Bourne Identity'. The film is in no way an accurate adaptation of the Ludlum novel, eliminating much of the novel's complex multi-layered plot and backstory. Nevertheless, it remains fairly true to the spirit of the novel as far as the protagonist, his motives and character are concerned. The Bourne Identity is a character based drama. Unlike the book, its a story of people adapting to near-impossible circumstances, rather than about uncovering conspiracies and schemes. Damon's brilliant performance as Bourne is supplemented by an excellent supporting cast of Franke Potente as Marie Kreutz, the film's female lead; Chris Cooper as Conklin, a CIA black ops strategist; Brian Cox as Ward Abbott, a high-ranking CIA official and Clive Owen, in a minor but fairly significant role as the silent killer known as the Professor. All in all, a truly unforgettable film.",10,3,4,15 August 2008
Man of Steel," Truth and Justice...in the 21st Century
","At some point, probably in the mid to late 1980's, Batman suddenly became DC Comics' most popular character, and arguably, the most popular superhero character PERIOD, leaving the true 'granddaddy of all superheroes', Superman, far behind. The reasons for this were never difficult to discern. Batman, with his cool Gothic-noir styled world, his psychologically fascinating rogue's gallery, and the overall dark and cynical themes of his franchise (which resonated with the true state of contemporary society only too well) was understandably galaxies ahead in the zeitgeist than Superman with his old-timey ideals of 'Truth, Justice and the American Way'. The fact that Christopher Nolan gave the world the 'Dark Knight' trilogy of the most critically acclaimed comic- book films EVER, while all Superman fans got was a nostalgic look-back at the Christopher Reeves/Richard Donner days, sure didn't do the Big Blue Boy Scout any favors!Indeed, the greatest triumph of director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David Goyer, is undoubtedly the fact that, for the first time in a long while, Superman seems as grounded, emotionally intense, and dare I say 'cool' as the Dark Knight!The story is one which everyone is familiar with, yet the details have changed a bit, and its those little changed details which have imparted 'Man of Steel' with greater depth than the previous live-action adaptations of the character. From Krypton, to the Kents, to Clark's developing powers, to his emergence as Superman, his first meeting with Lois Lane; we see all the familiar beats of an often told story, and yet THIS time round, we're far more emotionally involved in this tale than we ever were before. Jor-El and Lara, Jonathan and Martha Kent, Lois, Perry et. all are no longer just supporting characters playing their part in the myth and bowing out from the stage-they truly are full- fledged characters whose actions and fates we are as investing in as we are those of Superman's.Speaking of the titular Man of Steel, special credit is due to the lead actor Henry Cavill for his very relatable portrayal of a character many have complained is completely unrelatable. In stark contrast to Reeves' somewhat one-dimensional, corny, paragon of selfless heroism, Cavill's Clark Kent is a far more conflicted character, demonstrating a few grey areas that will not fail to shock audiences. This is most vehemently NOT a Superman who spends his days saving kittens from trees.Amy Adams does a great job as Lois Lane, making her more than just a damsel-in-distress or a standard movie love interest. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner both stand out as Superman's kryptonian and human fathers respectively. And Michael Shannon truly steals the show as the violent, genocidal, yet oddly sympathetic General Zod.On the whole, 'Man of Steel' succeeds not only at reinventing a seemingly antiquated hero for the 21st century, but also as the pivotal film that sets the stage for a further realization of the DC Universe on the big screen...",10,2,6,22 June 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The Brilliant Beginning of the Epic End...
","Three years ago, the world held its collective breath as it flipped through the pages of the the final installment of JK Rowling's epic 7-part series, seeking the satiation for a curiosity that had all but consumed them absolutely for years-who would live? who would die? and what would become of the survivors? Thousands of theories and counter-theories later, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows revealed the answers at long last (some of which had already been predicted); but it wasn't just the resolution of sub-plots and character arcs and the solving of long-standing magical mysteries that gripped the reader, but above all the sheer epic scale and scope of this saga within a saga that spanned virtually the entirety of the fantastic realm spawned by Rowling. Needless to say, while the novel positively GLOWED with cinematic potential, adapting an epic such as this does present unprecedented challenges...even more so when one takes into account the Harry Potter film series predilection for liberally eliminating significant plot elements from the novels in hopes of condensing the stories for accommodation in a 2-3 hour time span. Now, the same clearly couldn't be done with the Deathly Hallows-the minutest elements were of paramount importance to the overall plot and couldn't be safely done away with without running the risk of completely butchering Rowling's story. To this end, the film-makers wisely decided to split the book into two films...And after a long wait Part I is finally here and it certainly surpasses expectations (then again, it is pretty much EXPECTED that an HP film WILL 'surpass expectations'...) The very first aspect of this film that strikes you is that it sends a message. A very strong message that the wizarding world has changed-for the worse. The trademark WB logo we see at the start of the film is shown to be rusting...in stark contrast to the glowing WB of old; much like the circumstances of the characters have taken a turn for the worst. Death Eaters are perpetually swirling about in the skies, waiting to attack members of the Order of the Pheonix when the slightest opportunity presents itself...Voldemort has taken control of the Ministry, using its official authority and power to hunt down dissidents to his fascist regime of pure-blood supremacy...and Harry, Ron and Hermione are forced out of the sanctuary of their homes, on the run in the wilderness, with barely a clue as to how they are to accomplish the crucial task their deceased mentor Albus Dumbledore left them-finding and destroying the Horcruxes (fragments of Voldemort's soul) that anchor the Dark Lord to life.Understandably, this film boasts not only of a darker tone but a radically different direction from its predecessors-no longer are the legendary trio of teenage wizards students...they are now fugitives from the 'evil empire', soldiers in a war they are ever so close to losing. Freed from the confines of Hogwarts, director David Yates seizes the opportunity to place the protagonists against the backdrop of a number of breathtaking scenic locations and in a number of situations (expertly crafted by Rowling) which provide a wealth of variety as opposed to the schoolyard atmosphere of previous installments-at one point we see Harry, Ron and Hermione on a Mission Impossible-style mission-breaking into the Ministry of Magic in order to steal a locket that might just be one of Voldemort's Horcruxes; later we catch them in an intensely blink-and-you-miss-it fast-paced chase through a forest; to say nothing of the chaotic duel in the claustrophobic confines Malfoy Manor towards the end. Truly, the action scenes are a class apart but another area where this film shines is character development-from being the boy wizard perpetually looking to Dumbledore for guidance, Harry is now the man calling the shots in this perilous quest to destroy Voldemort; and even his trusted 'sidekicks' Ron and Hermione are beginning to question their participation in his mission. Ron's violent emotional outburst in the middle of the film, Hermione's despair and wistfulness for a simpler past and Harry's eternal self-doubt and frustration leave as indelible an imprint on the viewer's mind as much as any of the magnificent displays of magic (courtesy of some truly revolutionary SFX) does-Ron near mental-breakdown after being psychologically tortured by a fragment of Voldemort's soul is the most emotionally powerful sequence in the film, as is the Harry-Hermione 'dance scene', a rare moment of light-heartedness in an otherwise grim story which exemplifies in many ways the deep love the two characters share, even in the absence of any romantic involvement.If there is one shortcoming in this film, it is that scarcely enough focus is given to the titular 'Deathly Hallows' in the film (save for a truly fantastic animation sequence explaining the legend behind them) as opposed to the novel-though no doubt they will be addressed in Part II given the crucial part they are to play at the end of the story. Dumbledore's backstory with the Dark wizard Gellert Grindlewald, the discovery of which has a debilitating impact on Harry's morale in the book, is likewise also sidelined, though perhaps that can be forgiven, given the time constraints.Despite these minor issues, the film does end up pretty well, which is to say, it ends badly for our characters who, having barely escaped with their lives (for what may well be the umpteenth time) watch one of their oldest friends die-to say nothing of Voldemort having reached the very pinnacle of his magical power in the very last scene...well, as those who have read the book know, things are only going to get worse before they even start remotely looking better for our heroes and undoubtedly Part I has left the audiences restless for the next (and final) installment that chronicles the (inevitable) triumph of good over evil in the wizarding world.",10,1,3,20 November 2010
Monsters vs. Aliens," A 'Monstrous' Success and certainly no 'Alien' to Entertainment!
","We live in an era of dark and gritty action films, most of which have been largely successful-the Bourne trilogy, The Dark Knight, Casino Royale, the International etc. But sometimes, its always better to watch something that exudes pure and unadulterated fun and a large dose of much needed optimism. After all films were originally meant to be a form of escapism and in these troubled times, we can sure do with some escapist fantasy.Who cares if monsters and aliens don't really exist? Who cares if there are no such things as UFO's, alien invasions and meteors which can turn young women into giants? Who cares if the US Government doesn't actually operate a top-secret facility to imprison monsters? Its all meant to be fiction, to be fantasy...and as long as its enjoyable, I'm all for it! The humour is excellent, the animation and effects doubly so. Some of the characters and their antics and dialogues can be extremely goofy and ridiculous...but SO WHAT?! as long as its funny and entertaining.I especially loved the part where the US President attempts 'first contact' with the alien probe. One of the most humorous parts of the film, undoubtedly.Ultimately, you can have all the grim and gritty action, graphic violence and death and stark realism you want in films, but it shouldn't really hinder your appreciation of a real winner like this one...",9,0,1,19 May 2009
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The best of the series so far...truly an 'atmospheric' film...
","If Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the true coming of age story for both Harry and for the series in general, then Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the spiritual coming of age for the series; something which the film adaptation emphasizes subtly but brilliantly. The story itself is a departure from the previous two books; both Sorceror's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were all Harry and his friends exploring all the wonders of the wizarding world, specifically Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. True, there WERE villains to fight and challenges to overcome and danger, but basically, for all intents and purposes, the first two books are very well-written and elaborate children's fantasy books. Prisoner of Azkaban is different; there is a constant atmosphere of depression, of darkness and evil lingering in the air. Harry is no longer a small innocent child opened up to a world of wonder; he is instead a young teenager filled with emotion, at one point prepared to kill a man he is convinced was responsible for his parents death. Such fantastic elements and trappings as a flying car, a three-headed dog or a giant chessboard are traded in for werewolves and Dementors, the latter personifying the atmosphere of evil and darkness lurking over Hogwarts and over Harry in particular. If the book is a departure from its predecessors, the film is doubly so, for it deviates from the two previous Potter films directed by Columbus both in plot as well as in overall direction (not surprising since we have a new director at the helm, Alfonso Curaro). There is a marked stylistic difference from the previous films-Hogwarts is no longer a wonderland of magic and fantasy, it is a dark ancient castle bubbling with mysterious and invisible forces, some of them evil...danger may well lurk in its every shadow! This transformation is not just something you see, you feel it, quite literally! Add on to this the fact that Harry is the prime target of an escaped convict believed to be a vicious mass murderer, and that he is dogged by omens of death (the Grimm) everywhere he goes, not to mention being particularly susceptible to the despair spread by the Dementors and you get the idea of the atmosphere that is being skillfully and subtly crafted here. And yet, as Dumbledore rightly says early on in the film, 'Happiness can be found even in the darkest of places'. For it is in this films that Harry first truly finds a mentor (he and Dumbledore have barely shared any screen time at this point); in Remus Lupin, his new Defence Against the Dark teacher, who teaches him to combat his despair both literally by teaching him a spell to repel the Dementors, and figuratively by offering him moral support throughout the film. One of the few shortcomings about this film was that a lot of the expository dialogs from the book were left out, presumably to maintain a fast pace, in stark contrast to the previous films which were almost word to word adaptations in most regards; while these omissions do not ordinarily detract from the story in any way, die-hard fans may find their absence disquieting The performances are spot on, as expected in any Potter film, though Lupin comes across as being more confident and assertive than in the book (a small liberty) and Draco Malfoy seems reduced almost to comic relief. But overall, my review is an appreciation of the film as a whole. This is definitely the best film in the series too date...it clearly surpasses its otherwise excellent predecessors, and none of its successors have succeeded in coming close to matching it; though Half-Blood Prince may well be the one that beats it when it releases later this week.",10,0,1,12 July 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man," Simply Amazing...Nuff said!
","A decade ago, Tobey Maguire brought everyone's friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man to the big screen in Sam Raimi's blockbuster film, that spawned two sequels and won a legion of loyal fans across the globe...including me! For it was Raimi's 'Spider-Man' that first introduced me to Peter Parker and his world, and for that I will always be grateful to the film...but, there's simply no denying the fact that Marc Webb's 'The Amazing Spider-Man' has FAR surpassed the webhead's original cinematic incarnation!I think the best comparison one can offer for this film is Christopher Nolan's now-legendary Batman reboot, 'Batman Begins'. Much like how 'Begins' reinvented the Dark Knight for a new generation by focusing on a more grounded, character-driven arc for Bruce Wayne...'Amazing Spider- Man' does the same for Peter Parker. This is a Spider-Man one almost feels CAN exist in the real world...a Peter Parker who, while technically still a 'nerd', is no milksop and far from a goody-two- shoes.Andrew Garfield unquestionably deserves the bulk of the credit for the success of this film. He highlights the duality of Peter Parker and Spider-Man as Maguire never did-'Spider-Man' is not just Peter in a mask...Spider-Man is Peter freed from all the restraints of his identity, all the consequences of his actions. The mask of Spider-Man, to Peter, represents the anonymity similarly offered by Internet chat- rooms and forums; a point Garfield has raised in interviews, and which is is reflected throughout the film. His Peter doesn't become a superhero overnight...rather, his is a journey that encompasses the whole narrative of the film until, by the end, we finally see him become the heroic legend we all know and love. Perhaps the most striking difference, at least on a superficial level, between Garfield's Spider- Man and his predecessor, is the fact that this is a Spidey who's liberal with the wise-cracks. He is a hormonal, sometimes annoying, 17 year old and he sure acts like one!Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans deliver solid performances as Gwen Stacy and Dr. Curt Connors respectively. Stone's Gwen Stacy is certainly superior to Kirsten Dundt's Mary Jane Watson from the previous series-she's not just a love interest, but an integral part of the plot, along with her father, Captain George Stacy (Dennis Leary). Ifans plays Connors as a well-intentioned visionary gone astray, literally, as the reptilian monster known as the 'Lizard'...a powerful performance that easily rivals those of William Dafoe as Green Goblin or Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus from the old series.Beyond the excellent portrayals though, the movie's true strength is derived from an excellent script and some brilliant direction on the part of Marc Webb. While quiet a few liberties have been taken with the source material, Webb manages to stay pretty close to the spirit of Stan Lee's original story. The 'Ultimate Spider-Man' series has also clearly been a major influence, both stylistically and conceptually. While the film is a complete story in itself, there are a few plot threads left hanging...mysteries waiting to be resolved in the inevitable future installments. For now though, Spidey fans all over the world can enjoy this wonderful love-letter to Stan Lee and Steve Dikto's 50 year old creation!",10,101,203,29 June 2012
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A superb celebration of the entire X-men franchise!
","One of the most eagerly awaited superhero films of the decade (if not, like, EVER), 'X-men Days of Future Past' certainly hasn't been crushed by the weight of ginormous expectations placed on it - rather, it has far surpassed those expectations to become one of the greatest comic- book films of all time. In my opinion, DOFP may well lay claim to inclusion in an elite club of superhero films that includes The Dark Knight and The Avengers.Indeed, Bryan Singer's task in DOFP was far more ambitious in some ways than Joss Whedon's mission with 'The Avengers'. This time, it wasn't a bunch of superheroes that had to be united on screen, but rather two disparate franchises within the X-men franchise - the world of the original X-men trilogy (with Jackman, Stewart, McKellan et. all), and the 'prequel' world of 'X-men First Class (with Hoult, Fassbender, McAvoy et. all). And he does so masterfully, uniting the two eras of the franchise into one cohesive whole...further developing the younger cast of 'First Class' while also giving a fitting tribute to the ones who started it all.Hugh Jackman of course is the star of the movie, who literally bridges the two casts just as his character Wolverine uses time-travel to bridge the two eras. But the true protagonist of this film is James McAvoys's younger Charles Xavier. In 1973, Charles is a far cry from the wise mentor and leader embodied by Patrick Stewart - he is a tortured soul, a drug-addict who has numbed his mutant powers in order to be able to sleep peacefully, a man who has seemingly lost his purpose. In an interesting inversion of their relationship from the original films, Logan is forced to mentor the young Charles and set him down the path to becoming the legendary Professor X. Michael Fassbender does a great job as the younger, more militant Eric Lensherr/Magneto. And Jennifer Lawrence's Raven/Mystique is of course the lynchpin of the film's time- travel plot. When we last saw her in 'First Class', she was torn between the opposing paths of Charles and Eric. The original trilogy would have us believe she is destined to become Magneto's ally and fellow mutant terrorist...but if this film teaches us anything, its that the 'future is not set'...Despite the focus on the 'First Class' cast (Wolverine notwithstanding), many of the characters from the original cast get their moments to shine in the midst of the final desperate battle with the mutant-killing Sentinels-most notably Ellen Page's Kitty Pryde, Patrick Stewart's older Professor X, and Ian McKellan's Magneto. Also, while the film in many ways functions as a direct sequel to 'First Class', owing partly to the time-travel plot and partly to the return of franchise creator Bryan Singer, this film feels more or less like a spiritual sequel to X2 - from the use of the soundtrack of that movie, to a number of homages and callbacks to that movie.On the whole, DOFP is both an ending and a beginning (a fitting thing for a time travel movie to be!) and leaves you excited for the next installment in this, the longest-running superhero franchise ever!",10,7,13,1 June 2014
Quantum of Solace," Good, but certainly not great
","As the sequel to the critically acclaimed Casino Royale, and with the largest budget of any Bond movie ever, expectations were soaring pretty high for Quantum of Solace, the 22nd film of the Bond franchise. Sadly, the film simply does not live up to the high standards established by its predecessor. That's not to say its a bad film. It's pretty good actually, but still somewhat of a disappointment compared to Casino Royale.As far as action is concerned, QOS has it all. Chase sequences on land, sea and air; violent physical confrontations, death-defying stunts, intense shoot-outs, death...And yet, in the midst of this vast sieve of intense and furious activity, there is one fundamental element missing...the plot! 007 is on a mission to track down the mysterious organization responsible for Vesper's betrayal and death. Hes struggling not to make his mission personal. But somehow, the premise of the movie is used solely as an excuse to justify one spectacular action scene after the other, with a few words of dialogue stringing them together. Bond travels from Italy to Haiti, Austria, Bolivia and Russia leaving a trail of bodies in his wake, while we know nothing of the villains plans or the Bond girl for much of the first half of the film. The villain Dominic Greene does come across as the devil incarnate hidden amidst a smooth exterior, but we hardly see him indulging in anything remotely villainous for most of the film. Apart from his extensive contacts in the Bolivian police force and the CIA, he seems pretty vulnerable and poses no real threat to Bond. Bond instead spends much of the film evading the police, the CIA and MI6 itself as a rogue agent, with Greene and his organization(about which we barely know anything new)remaining relatively unknown factors.However, the lack of a plot is redeemed somewhat by the excellent performance of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Having redefined the character for a new era in Casino Royale, Craig continues with his darker interpretation of the character, even though, at times during this movie, Bond comes across more as a hit-man for MI6 rather than a spy, although one cannot entirely fault Craig for this. Craig plays the character with a hitherto unseen intensity, especially in a confrontation at the end of the movie. His Bond can be the suave and sophisticated secret agent when he wants to, but its only an act...inside hes a cold-blooded killer who happens to be bound by duty and by principles. Bond comes across as a defender of faith and a destroyer of evil even in the darkest and most corrupt of times. Judi Dench supplements Craig's performance in her role as MI6 chief M, who is still doubtful as to whether she can trust 007 and his unconventional methods with this mission. M is around in this film a lot more than any of the Bond girls or the villain, shes almost as constant a presence as Bond himself. Bond and M's relationship, which is both professional and even personal to an extent continues to develop in this film. Then we have Jeffrey Wright playing CIA Agent Felix Leiter, who comes across as a man who shares Bond's views but lacks the necessary will and zest for action to do something about them, instead preferring to place his trust in Bond. Olga Kurlenko plays Camille, the feisty Bond girl on a mission of vengeance much like Bond's himself, who becomes Bond's ally rather than love interest. And Mathieu Almaric's portrayal of Greene I have already mentioned.Ultimately, Quantum of Solace may not match up to such Bond greats as Casino Royale, From Russia with Love and Thunderball, but it is in no way a failure of the likes of Moonraker and A View to a Kill. If you simply look at it solely as an action film, you would appreciate it a lot more than if you try to compare it to the more plot driven Bond films.",8,3,5,11 November 2008
The Butterfly Effect," The Bittersweet Effect
","The Butterfly Effect is one of the most intriguing time travel films I've come across. A lot of time travel films focus a lot on temporal paradoxes, how to avoid them, and their consequences, or alternatively on the idea of predestination and the unavoidable fate...The Butterfly Effect though completely disregards all conventional time travel theory and talk of paradoxes, and instead seeks to use time travel as a means to convey a meaningful message-even if one had the power to play God, one can never truly set everything right because there is no such thing as a perfect world...This is the lesson which the protagonist Evan Treborn (played masterfully by Ashton Kutcher) rather brutally learns, when he discovers his ability to revisit certain pivotal and traumatic events in his past and change them. When he returns to the present, he discovers that the smallest of changes he made to the past have compounded over time to literally create a new reality. As Evan explores these alternate realities and alternate lives he's created for himself, he discovers that in each of them, something has gone horribly wrong, either for himself or for his friends and family. This compels him to go back and change things again, only to make them worse each time. Ultimately, he does succeed in creating what is arguably as close to a 'perfect' world as is possible, but the sacrifice he's had to make has turned what should have been a 'happy ending' into a bittersweet one at best.I think one of the most intriguing aspects of this movie is that how the smallest of changes can completely change the course of an individual's destiny and shape his or her personalities in completely unpredictable ways (much like the real-life concept of the 'butterfly effect' teaches how the smallest of actions can have unprecedented results over time)...and Evan's reactions to these alternate versions of his friends and family are interesting to behold. So in one reality, his love interest's a traumatized young waitress, in another she's a happy sorority sister, in yet another she's a prostitute, and she actually ends up as a corpse a couple of times...another childhood friend of the protagonist goes from being a psychopathic potential murderer in one reality to being a devout Christian missionary in another! And let's not forget the numerous avatars of Evan himself in each reality, some of them hilarious, others tragic...The cast have all done a pretty good job, but ultimately its the story, and the underlying moral behind it, that makes this film a winner...",10,2,4,26 July 2011
Batman Begins," Creation of a Legend
","Though this is very likely forever going to be overshadowed by its epic sequel, The Dark Knight, Batman Begins is nevertheless a masterpiece in itself. It is the film which rescued the Batman franchise from the campiness and superficiality that had all but destroyed it after Joel Schumacher's dismal Batman and Robin and redefined and reinterpreted this iconic character for a new generation, by telling a story which had thus far seldom been coherently and completely told outside of the comics canon: the origin of the Batman. While at its core, the story is a simple and tragic tale of a young boy, forever scarred emotionally by the brutal murder of his parents, who is motivated to fight a relentless war against injustice in order to rid a city of the evil which claimed his parents life; there are greater dimensions to the story which Christopher Nolan has done a superb job of representing on the silver screen in a most compelling manner.The primary appeal of the story lies in its psychological depth. Unlike previous superhero outings which relied primarily on plot and action, Nolan has chosen to centre both of these around the psychological development of the protagonist, Bruce Wayne (played to perfection by Christian Bale). This movie is as much about Bruce's emotional and spiritual journey from a traumatized young orphan, to an aggressive young man disillusioned with the justice system, to the aimless wanderer seeking a means to fight injustice and haunted by his childhood demons and finally to a determined and focused man who has mastered his skills and fears and is prepared to begin his war against injustice; as much as it is about the story of how Bruce puts on the cape and cowl. It is under the tutelage of Ducard (Liam Nelson) that Bruce Wayne learns to conquer his own fear and by doing so manipulate the fears in others. Returning to Gotham and resuming his public life as a billionaire playboy and socialite, Wayne secretly goes about his task of constructing an alternate identity, a symbol that shall forever remain incorruptible and indestructible and shall strike terror into the hearts of the criminal underworld. Before long, with assistance and moral support from his faithful butler and confidant Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) an old friend of his father's and a skilled scientist and engineer and Sergeant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), one of the few untainted officers of the Gotham City police force, Bruce unleashes upon the city's corrupt underbelly his alter ego: Batman, and succeeds in single-handedly bringing down its biggest crime lord. But soon, Gotham's mysterious new vigilante finds himself facing his first great challenge-of saving the city from an enemy who has also learnt to manipulate the fears in others, through more insidious means...Bale's performance as both Bruce Wayne and Batman is par excellence. Bale portrays Batman as being not merely a man in a suit, but rather a force of nature unto himself, completely distinct from albeit wielded by Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman play their parts well enough and Katie Holmes does a fair job as Bruce's childhood friend and love interest Rachel Dawes. Liam Nelson's character is a far more sympathetic villain than previous 'Batman baddies' in the films, being, like Bruce, a man committed to fighting injustice, albeit in more extreme ways. His actions act as a counterpoint to Batman's strict moral code of refraining from lethal action.With an excellent musical score and eye-popping (albeit moderately realistic) action, Batman Begins is undoubtedly a fait accompli which can never be underestimated no matter how successful any sequels it has spawned are or will bee...",10,1,2,15 June 2009
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The best 'Impossible Mission' EVER!!!
","The Mission Impossible film series, while great movies in their own right, have somehow never achieved the legendary status of James Bond, or more recently, the Bourne trilogy. 'Ghost Protocol' however MORE than allows Ethan Hunt and his team to join that exclusive club...accomplishing the near impossible mission with flying colors!!!MI: GP opens with Ethan Hunt in a Moscow prison, being broken out by fellow IMF agents Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Jane Carter (Paula Patton) just in time for his next mission-infiltrating the Kremlin. But things go horribly wrong and soon, Russia and the United States find themselves at the brink of war and the entire IMF is disavowed. Hunt and his team, which now also includes IMF analyst Brandt (Jeremy Renner) now find themselves being forced to operate without official sanction or support, against overwhelming odds, to prevent a madman from unleashing nuclear holocaust upon the world.The film has a perfect blend between plot and action, something which few movies in this genre ever truly achieve. We literally begin the film on the move with a foot chase in Budapest, and we are treated to several visually stunning set pieces, including but not limited to a chase through a sandstorm in Dubai...but the intricate plot seamlessly merges with the action. Brandt is truly an enigma for most of film...the mystery surrounding him, while not essential to the central plot of the film, is a little something extra to tickle the back of the viewer's mind! Tom Cruise of course makes a brilliant comeback to the role of Ethan Hunt-with the veteran agent being forced to assume a new role for this film; that of the leader and mentor to an arguably dysfunctional 'family'.To fans of the past MI movies and espionage thrillers in general-there's plenty of action and intrigue to watch out for. But fans of the 60's TV series too would have plenty to cheer about...with a sequence in the middle of the film virtually a homage of an old episode! MI: GP has something for EVERYONE to enjoy...and if you enjoy EVERYTHING...then this movie has truly succeeded in its mission!",10,6,10,16 December 2011
The Bourne Legacy," Upholds the Legacy...despite its flaws
","The Bourne trilogy, loosely (VERY loosely!) based on the international bestsellers by Robert Ludlum and starring Matt Damon as the amnesiac black ops agent on the run from his former masters, redefined the espionage-thriller genre for the 21st century; with its gritty, realistic action; serious themes and emphasis on character and plot over glamour and exoticism. No less a franchise as James Bond has since been stylistically influenced by this groundbreaking series. But unlike the flamboyant 007, Jason Bourne's story was one with a clear beginning, middle and end. That end masterfully came about in the closing scenes of 'The Bourne Ultimatum'. For years it was believed Universal had finally laid one of its most successful franchises to rest - but inevitably, mass popularity and the lure of unprecedented commercial success won out, and 'The Bourne Legacy' is the result...The Bourne franchise is back, but oddly enough, Jason Bourne isn't. When Matt Damon, perhaps rightly, declined to return his iconic character to the big screen, Universal cast Jeremy Renner to play an entirely different character, albeit one patterned after Bourne at least on the surface level. Tony Gilroy, screen-writer of all Bourne films too date and the director of this one, has described 'Legacy' as not so much a sequel as much as an 'expansion' of the universe, and having seen the film, I have decided it is prudent to take him at his word.The early part of 'The Bourne Legacy' runs parallel to the events of 'The Bourne Ultimatum'. Even as Jason Bourne races across the globe, exposing the Treadstone program he was once part of, Colonel Eric Byer (played by Edward Norton), becomes increasingly concerned about the fall-out Bourne's very public actions will have on the myriad of US Government sanctioned black ops program. When the sh#t finally hits the fan (in the aforementioned ending of 'Ultimatum'), Byer decides to liquidate the 'Outcome' program, closely related to the now-exposed Treadstone. This involves not only the termination of its deep-cover genetically enhanced operatives, but also the scientists behind the breakthroughs that made the program possible.The movie follows the stories of the two survivors of the purge-Outcome field operative Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) and Outcome scientist and medical researcher Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who must depend on each other for their very survival. The pulse-pounding and often brutal action scenes are complemented very nicely by the chemistry between Renner and Weisz's characters. Marta is definitely a much superior female character to Franke Potente's Marie and Julia Stiles' Nicky Parsons from the trilogy. And Norton's morally ambiguous Byer comes across not so much as a villain as much as the uber-pragmatist, a self- confessed 'Sin Eater' who buries the 'moral excrement' in his work deep down inside. But where the film derives its strength from characterization and action, it is severely flawed when it comes to plot...especially towards the end. The conclusion is abrupt and provides hardly any resolution, beyond the tacit assurance of yet another sequel set in the Bourne universe...For a series that prided itself on its masterful story-telling, 'Legacy's' open-ended conclusion is sure to leave a sour taste in the mouths of many a die-hard fan and critic alike!In conclusion, 'The Bourne Legacy' set out with a specific purpose-to make the Bourne franchise viable again by expanding the universe through new characters and concepts. It certainly achieves THAT purpose and more, but fails to retain the standards of its predecessors when viewed as a stand-alone story.",8,3,8,12 August 2012
X-Men: Apocalypse," 'X-men Apocalypse' is an episode of an X-men cartoon brought to life!
","If 'First Class' was the prequel/quasi-reboot that refreshed the franchise for a new decade and 'Days of Future Past' was a celebration of the history of the entire X-men film franchise...then 'Apocalypse', the concluding chapter of this loose 'prequel trilogy' is Bryan Singer finally taking the X-men to its roots as a comic- book spectacle, something which a significant portion of the fanbase has been clamouring for, to varying degrees, since the very first X- film hit the silver screen. And it would be unfair to judge 'Apocalypse' without taking this into account...As a work of cinema, 'Apocalypse' pales in comparison to its two immediate predecessors and of course Singer's original two films. But as a comic-book fantasy brought to life, it more than delights! There are no themes, overt and subtle, of discrimination and evolution and destiny here (well, there are somewhere in the background, but they are hardly of any importance)...what this film does have is the X-men valiantly flying into battle to literally save the world. It does have bright, colorful costumes, tons of continuity references to films and comics alike, mindblowing SPX, and an extended cameo by a certain franchise star that will no doubt have the audience cheering. And that's fine! Not every comic-book film needs to be a 'Dark Knight' or even an 'Iron Man'.",9,9,18,22 May 2016
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A grossly underrated Fantastic experience!!!!
","Off late, especially with the relatively recent success of The Dark Knight, the general perception of audiences seems to be that the darker and more 'realistic' the tone of a superhero film, the more success it attains. While this is certainly true if you consider the two Nolan-directed Batman films, the first two X-men films, Burton's 1989 Batman film and a few others I could name; the truth is that it is not merely the dark tone that makes the film successful but the little things like plot construction, storytelling, characterization etc. which are oft overlooked these days. Another factor to be taken into account is whether a dark tone suits the character. Batman and the X-men may be dark because that tone suits the world they inhabit and the kind of stories that can be told with their characters. But try making Superman dark, and you'll find the result is not all that endearing. Which is why, I've never really understood the criticism directed towards the Fantastic Four films in general, and this one in particular for their 'campiness' and 'unrealism'. After all the Fantastic Four have always been campy and fun, because they were created in an era where comics were supposed to be campy and fun. After all, you cant expect a franchise which revolves around a family of celebrity superheroes constantly bickering with one another to be exactly dark and serious can you. And as far as the unrealism bit is concerned, the Fantastic Four have always been fantasy characters: they have always been about breaking the barriers and exploring new worlds of science and mysticism. They were never meant to be all that realistic in the first place. Which is why I think this film, while certainly not one the epic scale of TDK, is definitely one of the better superhero movies of all time. The campiness and the humour is present, though not over the top. The plot is simple, yet effective. The special effects are outstanding. And even amidst all the humour and fantasy, we have a few 'down to earth' character moments which remind us that our heroes are, after all, ordinary people with their own likes, dislikes, fears and anxieties. Reed Richards(Ion Gruduff) is torn between his dedication to science and to protecting the world. Sue Storm(Jessica Alba) is concerned about the effect of the team's very public superhero lifestyle will have on her future with Reed. Chris Evans does a great job as the Ben Grimm, interacting well with other characters and generally doing a good job as the resident strongman of the team. But as with the first film, it is Michael Chilkins who steals the show with his portrayal of Johnny Storm. The character is developed much further from being the shallow showman and exhibitionist of the previous film. While those external trappings are still present, even emphasized in the sequel, Johnny is portrayed as being a lot deeper. We empathize with him over his 'alienation' from the team due to his abnormal 'power problems', understand his frustration when he learns that Reed and Sue secretly plan to end their superheroic careers, and his feeling of guilt when he realizes he is continuously letting down his friends due to his hot-headedness. Johnny greatly grows as a character in this installment, though of course, it is Reed and Sue who remain the 'real' protagonists. The film does have a few flaws though. One of them is the Silver Surfer. Not so much the portrayal of the character (Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburn do a great job on that and the effects are spectacular), but I often thought that the Silver Surfer's background could have been expanded upon, given that he is the title character and the perceived 'villain' for much of the film. His origins and his connection to Galactus could have been brought out more clearly. Also, as in the previous film, the climax, though excellently filmed, could have been more elaborate. We have Johnny Storm acquiring the powers of all his teammates and fighting Doctor Doom but the main antagonist, Galactus, appears for all of three minutes as a giant cloud and the whole 'end of the world' thing is over before you know it. If the Silver Surfer is not the villain, then Galactus is, but the Fantastic Four don't even face him, which does not lend too much credibility to him being the primary antagonist. So is Dr. Doom the real villain then. It seems likely, but then again, Doom does spend most of the film working with the Fantastic Four to capture the Silver Surfer. Basically, we have a good plot, good dialogue, characterization etc. but no clear focus on the antagonist. Otherwise, this film is truly a fantastic experience!",9,3,7,7 May 2009
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight: An Epic
","The most awaited superhero film has finally arrived after three years of intrigue and excitement, and it has proved to be beyond all expectations; expectations being higher than ever.If there is one word to describe The Dark Knight its 'epic'. This is the epic story Tim Burton set out to create 19 years and while he did a good job, he came nowhere near matching this film.With 'Batman Begins' establishing the legend of Batman, TDK goes all out with Batman's war against evil. Christian Bale reprises his role as billionaire playboy and socialite Bruce Wayne, who is secretly the Batman, Gotham City's masked vigilante. Forming an uneasy alliance with James Gordon(played by Gary Oldman), one of Gotham's few honest police officers, and the new DA Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhart), the Batman is determined to bring down the remains of Gotham's Mob. Unfortunately for him, the Mob has made a deal with the Joker, a psychopathic killer to rid the city of Batman. The Joker is a conscience-less killer with no motivations beyond chaos, who embarks on a crusade against Gotham's avenger. With innocents dying, and people close to him being threatened, Batman must face of against the man who is destined to be his greatest adversary ever, while struggling over the question of whether is masked crusade is truly what the city needs. Does it deserve a open and honest hero with a face, a 'White Knight' like Harvey Dent? Or does it deserve him, the Dark Knight?Also appearing in this movie is Maggie Gyenhall as Rachel Dawes, Bruce's childhood friend and former love interest; Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce's faithful butler; and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, CEO of Wayne Enterprise, who supplies Batman with new advanced technologies to aid him in his war against crime.With such a talented cast playing their parts to perfection, the action and effects which embellish the script and elevate it to epic proportions, and of course, the underlying themes and motivations of the characters brilliantly displayed, it comes as no surprise that this film is truly a masterpiece!",10,3,7,20 July 2008
Jack Reacher," Introducing a new icon of the action genre...
","I'd never read any of the Lee Child 'Jack Reacher' novels so I went in with no particular expectations about the portrayal of this character. But this film can certainly live up to ANY expectations thriller fans might have had of it, in my opinion!Having seen Tom Cruise as the flamboyant, charming and somewhat Boy Scout-ish Ethan Hunt in the past, its refreshing to see him as someone almost as ruthless and taciturn as Jason Bourne or Daniel Craig's rendition of James Bond. Jack Reacher's appeal doesn't lie in the fact that he's a 'larger than life' figure, or the world's biggest bada##...it lies in the fact that he's a normal, perfectly relatable and very realistic human being, albeit a trained and skilled soldier and detective.Rosamund Pike does a great job as the lawyer, Helen-a far cry from glamorous 'Bond girls' (one of whom Pike herself has portrayed), and Lara Croft styled action heroines who normally populate the action film genre. Instead she's a three dimensional character with her own doubts, anxieties, convictions and flaws.One of the great things about this movie is how, without wavering from its narrative, it does highlight several significant real-world issues; ranging from the political debates over gun control, to legal representation for terrorists, to the politics surrounding the actions of military personnel overseas, to the corrupt political-industrial nexus...without necessarily taking sides or trying to come across as being preachy of moralistic.To sum it up, Jack Reacher is virtually a 'slice of life' piece...albeit, a very dark and grimy slice of life.",10,179,331,29 December 2012
Sherlock Holmes," The World's Greatest Detective is back; in a new old-fashioned way!
","The foggy gas-lit streets of 19th century London. The shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. The deerstalker hat, the violin, the pipe, the array of scattered notes, chemicals and weapons and the man, the legendary figure behind all these trappings...Sherlock Holmes. Ever since Arthur Conan Doyle exposed this, the greatest fictional creation in the history of England, if not the world, Holmes and his trusty companion Dr. Watson have enthralled millions with their antics in print and on screen, both big and small, light-hearted or dark, simple and complex...from the goldmine of Doyle's original short stories and novels to the propagandist wartime atmosphere of the Basil Rathbone films, to the Jeremy Brett TV series par excellence and much more. It was the latter actor's masterful portrayal of Holmes that has invariably stuck in the public consciousness and as such most people perceive Holmes as a highly introverted intellectual, a perfect middle-aged Victorian gentleman albeit slightly neurotic, a man more accustomed to using his mind than his fists. However in the process, people did forget that Conan Doyle's Holmes was a multi-faceted character, a man of action in addition to his intellectual pursuits, and not necessarily the prim and proper gentleman his screen adaptations often displayed him as being. Guy Ritche however has boldly set out to reinvent Holmes for a 21st century audience, albeit keeping in mind Arthur Conan Doyle's vision for the character and especially the 'other side' to him that was largely neglected previously.The Holmes played by Robert Downey Jr. is not merely a detective (though his feats of detection are no less legendary than those of the literary version of the character)-he is also a legendary hero, a one man army, a Jack of All Trades-a martial arts expert, swordsman, shooter, master of disguise among other things. Far from being the perfect gentleman, he is a misfit, a bit of a rogue, blessed with a sardonic wit and a tinge of arrogance that he subtly and humorously reveals at times. Perhaps a greater departure from the previous screen versions of Watson is Jude Law's rendition of the doctor as a young, capable and highly competent man of action, an amateur detective in his own right. Holmes and Watson's relationship in this film, which critics have misinterpreted as being homosexual in nature, is in fact intensely amusing. Also notable is Rachel MacAdams portrayal of the femme fatale Irene Adler, the master thief and temptress who also happens to be the only woman Holmes has ever really cared for. And Mark Strong completes the strong cast with his powerful portrayal of the villainous Lord Blackwood who harnesses one of the greatest and deadliest forces the world has ever known: the power of belief and superstition.Ritche may portray Holmes and Watson in the 19th century albeit he portrays them from a 21st century artistic viewpoint. The characters we see are Doyle's characters but from a modern perspective. For instance, Watsons exasperation with Holmes more unnatural behavior, while manifested rather subtly in the original stories is emphasized greatly in this film. Holmes and Watson's fighting prowess while no doubt alluded to in the stories, is vividly portrayed in the film. Even Holmes's attraction towards Adler, while very subtle and discreet in the Doyle stories, is made somewhat blatantly evident here. This modernization of perspective does not take away from the characters but rather enhances them greatly and makes them far more relevant and relatable to the present day cinema audiences.Also to be commended is the vivid reconstruction of Victorian-era London.",9,0,0,18 January 2010
The Wolverine," A well-deserved Japanese vacation for the Wolverine!
","'X-men Origins Wolverine' was an entertaining film, admittedly, but it was a deeply flawed movie that ultimately didn't do the character or his origin story enough justice. 'The Wolverine', Fox's (and Hugh Jackman's) second attempt to give the character a solo adventure, does rectify a lot of those flaws, and ends up as a good film (maybe even a very good one)...but it just falls short of 'great'.The movie undoubtedly has its strengths. It treats the character and the source material seriously, adopting a dark noir-ish tone befitting Wolverine and more specifically the 'Japanese saga' it is based on. Logan's inner struggle with his immortality, and his lack of purpose, are perfectly illustrated, and resolved. The supporting cast, including the members of the Yashida clan (Master Yashida, Shingen and Mariko), Harada, and of course, Yukio, are near-perfect. Viper proves to be a chilling antagonist (though nowhere near the level of Brian Cox's William Stryker, Ian McKellan's Magneto, or even Liev Schreiber's Victor Creed!) The cinematography is breath-taking-from the opening scenes in the Canadian wilderness to the alleyways of Tokyo. But where the movie disappoints, to a large extent, is in its plot structure. What could have been an pure atmospheric Japanese noir drama/action flick, ends up getting 'polluted' with clichÃ©d superhero and thriller tropes such as lost superpowers, 'secret identities' and 'surprise' twists. Instead of being the definitive Wolverine story, this movie ends up being a darn good superhero story...but certainly nothing close to the likes of The Dark Knight or The Avengers.",9,6,14,26 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," End of a Legend...End of an Era...
","We always knew it would be great. And what we knew has now been codified beyond a shadow of a doubt.'The Dark Knight Rises', the epic conclusion to Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking Batman trilogy, endows the world's most celebrated fictional crusader with precisely just that: a conclusion...something extremely rare in a world where superhero stories are endlessly regurgitated and recycled. The status quo says that Bruce Wayne spends his days as a billionaire playboy and socialite, and his nights as Batman fighting villain after villain and locking them away in Arkham...until the next time. But Nolan and his team have transcended the status quo and in doing so have created a fully realized legend with a clear beginning, middle and end.'Rises' begins eight years after the conclusion of 'The Dark Knight' as we are re-introduced to an older, physically and psychologically scarred Bruce Wayne (played as masterfully as always by Christian Bale). Having long hung up the cape and cowl of Batman, Bruce nevertheless is unable to move on from the tragedies of his past, much to the despair of his butler and surrogate father Alfred Pennyworth (the inimitable Michael Caine). But when the terrorist leader known only as 'Bane' (Tom Hardy) unleashes his reign of terror upon Gotham City, the Dark Knight must rise again, to finally become the symbol of hope the city needs AND deserves in a time of war; aided by trusted allies Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Commissioner James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the enigmatic, morally ambiguous 'Robin Hood', Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway).Borrowing thematic elements from such epic Batman stories as 'The Dark Knight Returns' and 'No Man's Land'; 'Rises' is essentially a war film at its core...and not merely a war against organized crime, or a crazed 'super-villain', but a war against terror, anarchy and the very face of evil. The stakes have never been higher in ANY Batman story (none on film at any rate) and not even the Joker has posed as overwhelming a threat to the Dark Knight as the brutally and efficiently lethal Bane. And for the first time, one actually fears for the lives of our heroes. Because Nolan is no believer in the indefinite status quo...and anything goes...So does Batman truly end or not? The answer to THAT question would only be known to those who have had the pleasure and privilege of viewing this cinematic masterpiece. Suffice to say that regardless of the final fate of Bruce Wayne, what this film truly marks is the end of an era. A glorious era in storytelling that began all the way back in 2005 when a franchise rose from the ashes and began life anew. We believed in Christopher Nolan for all these years...and it will be a LONG time before someone entertains us the way he did...",10,2,7,28 July 2012
Casino Royale," James Bond: The Reinvention
","An MI6 agent brutally kills an underworld contact in a washroom and shoots a corrupt MI6 section chief to death in his office in Prague. For these 2 assassinations, he is promoted to '00' status. And thus begins the legend of James Bond, 007, suave and sophisticated secret agent, 'licensed to kill'.Casino Royale is significant in two ways. It is not only an adaptation of Ian Flemming's pivotal first novel, which introduced the James Bond character to the world, but it is also a reinvention of Bond for the 21st century. The Bond portrayed here by Daniel Craig is a darker, cynical version of Flemming's Cold War-era character updated for the present day. In this film, Bond is truly a complex character, a blunt instrument who is in reality a tortured soul. This film presents aspects of James Bond which were almost completely ignored in the previous 20 films but were touched upon subtly in some of the novels.The plot is more or less faithfully adapted from the novel, albeit updated from its original 1953 settings. James Bond, on his first mission as 007, investigates an international organisation that funds terrorist groups. After successfully preventing a bombing, Bond gains the confidence of his MI6 chief, M, who assigns him to a new mission. Bond must face Le Chiffre, a banker and member of the mysterious organisation, at the card tables in a high stakes poker game at Casino Royale in Montenegro. Bond must beat Le Chiffre at the game, render the man bankrupt, thereby forcing him to surrender to MI6.Craig's brilliant portrayal of Bond is supplemented by an excellent cast of characters. Judi Dench reprises her role as M, the stern yet motherly MI6 head. Mads Mikellsen plays Le Chiffre, a man of few eccentricities, but of insurmountable menace. Carlo Giancii is Rene Mathis, Bond's MI6 contact in Montenegro. Jeffrey Wright is Felix Leiter, Bond's ally in the CIA. And finally, Eva Green plays the enigmatic Vesper Lynd, Treasury agent and Bond's love interest.With such an incomparable cast, plot and tone, Casino Royale is undoubtedly one of the best Bond films too date, surpassed only perhaps by the classic 'From Russia with Love' with its ending leading into the first ever direct Bond sequel, 'Quantum of Solace'. Make no mistake. The new James Bond is here to stay.",10,3,8,2 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The End of an Era
","I was all of nine years old when I first saw Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone...a movie that literally propelled me into another world, as it had propelled countless spellbound viewers before me and countless after me...a fantasy world intricately woven by the literary genius of JK Rowling. I, like billions of others, followed the legendary magical adventures of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, Neville, Snape, Malfoy and innumerable other memorable characters through seven books and seven movies (and even the odd video game or two, to say nothing of the T-shirts and action figures!)...in many ways (most ways, actually), this magical journey came to an end on the midnight of June 21st 2007...but insofar as it was the movies that introduced me to the world of Harry Potter, I only truly considered the journey complete when I saw the epic cinematic spectacle that is 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2'.It is difficult to be objective about this movie and analyse it as just another movie, even just another Harry Potter movie, for it is anything but that. It is the end of an era, in cinematic history, in literary history, in creative history...in the history of pop culture itself.And ultimately, the minor mundane details, the perceived 'innacuracies' and omissions, don't really matter much this time round...it matters very little that we don't learn ALL about the Deathly Hallows, or Dumbledore's somewhat dubious past...it matters even less that we don't see Wormtail die and that Neville Longbottom ends up with Luna Lovegood rather than with Hannah Abbott...it doesn't seem, strangely enough...to even matter at all that we don't get even a halfway convincing explanation for how Harry survived his second near-death experience at Lord Voldemort's hands...story has always been important to the Harry Potter franchise, but this time its not about story...its about images and icons...be it that of Harry, Ron and Hermione flying into the London sky on the back of a dragon, or that of Harry confronting Snape in the Great Hall of Hogwarts...Hagrid carrying Harry's seemingly lifeless body back into the castle or the climactic showdown between Harry and Voldemort...these are iconic moments brought to life from the pages of Rowling's magnum opus, which will remain entrapped in our imaginations forever!I will not commend the cast and crew of this movie, and all the others before it, for I expected nothing less from them anyway. I will instead urge everyone who reads this to take a moment to acknowledge the end of an era...to perhaps even bask in the euphoria of Voldemort's defeat and Harry's victory, which epitomizes the perpetual tale of good's conquest of evil with a radiant brilliance which perhaps few other works of literature have ever been able to muster...JK Rowling may not have been William Shakespeare, but the great bard's writings never brought millions of fans out onto the streets at midnight waiting for the release of his latest book...THAT is the true inimitable magic of Harry Potter!!!",Null,0,0,23 July 2011
Fantastic Four," A Fantastic Film!!!!
","Fantastic Four is certainly by no stretch of the imagination anyone's favourite superhero film. Perhaps that's partly to do with the fact that the Fantastic Four aren't your conventional superheroes by any stretch of the imagination. Their a dysfunctional 'family' of sorts with no 'secret identities' and masks to hide behind, no identity issues and certainly not quite so unbelievably noble and heroic (at least not in the beginning). The truth is that Fantastic Four is certainly not meant to be a serious superhero film or an epic or anything like that. The Fantastic Four are not meant to be larger than life legends like Superman or Spiderman. They are ordinary flawed human beings who are either over-awed, freaked out or downright depressed over their newfound abilities. The film itself is supposed to be a 'fun film'. If it appears campy, then that's the intention of the screenwriters. Because lets face it, there are enough epic tales of the spawning of great heroes (Superman, Batman Begins, Iron Man) and enough tales of super-beings tormented by their powers and by the world (The Incredible Hulk, the X-men trilogy), so its fitting that there is at least one film that is more light-hearted and has a 'coolness' and 'feel good' factor about it. One of the more appealing aspects of the film are that its protagonists don't have any complex characterization like most superheroes have. Their characters are an open book to us right from the start and their reactions are quite predictable throughout the film. Reed Richards (Ion Gruduff) is the cautious ever-analytic scientist who is curious and concerned about the team's mysterious new powers. Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) is the mature and orderly woman who detests the abnormality of her's and her friends predicament. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) is easily the team's source of comic relief; he's the hot-headed youngster who enjoys his powers. Ben Grimm (Michael Chilkins) is the film's tragic hero who hates his transformation into the monstrous 'Thing' but gradually comes to accept his powers. Grimm is the only character whose characterization drastically changes and evolves over the course of the film. If the film has a flaw, its in its villain, Victor von Doom (Julian McMahan). While the idea of linking the Fantastic Four's origins with that of their archenemy is a pretty good idea, and the changes in Doom's backstory makes his rivalry with Mr. Fantastic more apparent, Doom's characterization and motivation itself is pretty lacking. We understand that he is a man craving for power, but what he intends to do with that power apart from killing people and damaging public property is never clearly explained. The final fight sequence between the Four and Doom, though pretty exciting, could have been longer and more elaborate. Instead, the Fantastic Four beat Doom in something like five minutes! which is thoroughly dissatisfying. All in all, Fantastic Four is a great film if you accept it for what it is and overlook its minor flaws.",9,1,2,6 May 2009
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne is Supreme
","The Bourne Supremacy was the second installment of Universal Pictures groundbreaking trilogy based on the novels of the late thriller author, Robert Ludlum. However, unlike most flashy and 'style over substance' thrillers these days, the Bourne films have always been considered a neo-realistic take on the morally ambiguous genre of espionage thrillers. This brilliant piece of action packed yet intelligent cinema is certainly no exception. Matt Damon reprises his role as the amnesiac former assassin, Jason Bourne, an ex-operative of the CIA, who turned rogue after he failed to execute an unsanctioned black ops mission and lost his memory in the process. As the film begins, Bourne is living a relatively peaceful life, in hiding, with his girlfriend, Marie Helena Kruetz (Franka Potente). Bourne continues to be haunted by fragmented memories of his former violent life, which he consistently tries to dissociate himself from. However, his past soon catches up with him in the form of a deadly new adversary, Kirill (Karl Urban). And when his beloved Marie dies from the assassin's bullet, a grief-stricken and enraged Bourne, believing his old masters in the CIA are responsible for this assault, resolves to return to Europe and seek revenge against the Agency. The Agency however is not responsible for this attack thought they too have bones to pick with their former asset, as they suspect that Bourne is involved in a conspiracy to cover up the theft of millions of dollars of CIA funds. Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is determined to capture Bourne and find answers, whereas Ward Abbott (Brian Cox, reprising his role from the previous film) simply wants to terminate Bourne. However, neither are likely to succeed on their respective missions. For Bourne has unleashed every ounce of training and skill, all the killer instincts he was implanted with in a forgotten lifetime, against his creators. He will play their deadly games again, but this time on his own terms. What follows is a nearly 2 hour long cat-and-mouse chase sequence, which begins in a seaside town in India, and continues in the streets of Naples, Munich, Berlin and finally Moscow, as Bourne demonstrates his supremacy in the fields of espionage, unarmed combat, evasive tactics and high-speed pursuits. Ultimately, the Bourne Supremacy is probably the strongest of the trilogy, both in terms of plot and action, and the title therefore is justified in every possible respect. Kudos, to director Paul Greengrass and the rest of the cast and crew for this masterpiece!",10,3,4,4 April 2009
