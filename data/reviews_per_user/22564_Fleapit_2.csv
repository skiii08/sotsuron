Casablanca," One Night of Love? The unanswered questions. !! SPOILER !!
","!! SPOILER !! Without doubt a work of genius. Full marks, 10 out of 10. When this film appeared in 1942 Bogart was yet the great Star he was to become. During the 30s he had regularly featured in Warner Bros. gangster films as a typical hoodlum; all churned out on the WB assembly line with little of interest in them. His reputation at the time was on a par with that of the dependable B-movie actor Lloyd Nolan, perhaps even lower. However, recently he had been cast in The Maltese Falcon where he had displayed a previously unknown potential; Casablanca, in retrospect, transformed his career for him. It also enhanced that of Ingrid Bergman. Others on this website have said much in praise of this film which screams out for its missing sequel (did Hollywood fear a flop so they shied away from it?) a prequel would not come amiss either. So many things are unexplained in the story that there is ample material for further development. Was it coincidence that the man who showed Laszlo the Cross of Lorraine ring, Berger, and Ilsa were both Norwegian? Why does Laszlo, the great underground leader want to go to America at a time, 1941, when all external resistance movements are centred in London? Signor Ferrari is a very mysterious character, is there something more to him than just a clever black marketeer and owner of the Blue Parrot bar? What really took place between Ilsa and her lost lover Richard on that last night together? What happened to Ilsa and Laszlo after they left for America? Did she and Richard ever meet again? Why was the attitude of Laszlo towards her so cold? What was the powerful force that tore the recently reunited lovers apart when they could easily have stayed together? As for a prequel, there are the untold stories of Ilsa and Laszlo, Ilsa and Richard (briefly related in the film) and Laszlo himself.Here is how I see the story continuing. After Ilsa and Laszlo depart on the plane, Berger goes to Ferrari who turns out to be a British agent and the contact man for all agents operating from London in the region. Berger identifies himself as a Norwegian resistance member sent out from London and requests help in getting back urgently. He gives Ferrari a brief coded message for radioing to London. Ferrari promptly sends this off and routinely adds the information that Ilsa and Laszlo are en route for Lisbon. He also requests that Rick and Captain Louis Renault, who have gone into hiding, should accompany Berger as they are in mortal danger from the Nazis who are seeking revenge for the killing of Major Strasser. The next night a small boat takes the three men out to sea where they rendezvous with a Royal Navy warship which carries them safely to England.After arriving in Lisbon, Ilsa and Laszlo go to the American embassy to get the required travel documents and are whisked into the office of the ambassador who tells them that he has been urgently informed by the American ambassador in London that Laszlo has been requested to fly to London by the next plane to participate in a top secret high level conference of senior resistance leaders. However when the couple reach the Norwegian resistance HQ in London, Ilsa promptly denounces Laszlo as a Nazi plant who has infiltrated the upper echelons of underground movements throughout Europe; he holds the rank of colonel in the SS. She learns from Berger that Richard is in England serving in General deGaulle's Free French Army; so the lovers are brought together again. The beautiful, alluring Ilsa is, in reality, a member of the Norwegian secret service who had been deployed as a honey trap to bait Laszlo when suspicions first arose about him following the Nazi take over of Czechoslovakia. Ilsa entered into her sham marriage with Laszlo in England before the war in order to get evidence of his duplicity and, later, his links to the Norwegian traitor, Quisling. Ilsa had explained all this to Richard on their last night together. The two promised each other that they would marry but first she had to complete her work on exposing Laszlo. Richard was sworn to secrecy. Afterwards when the waiter, Carl, escorted Ilsa back from Rick's place she had given him a note in Norwegian to be delivered at once to her compatriot, Berger, instructing him to inform London that she had all the evidence against Laszlo. This was the coded message that he sent via Ferrari. Berger's mission all along had been to ensure the safety of Ilsa.It takes a few months in England before Ilsa's marriage can be annulled on the grounds that it was not consummated due to the impotence of Laszlo (this explains the puzzling brother and sister like relationship between the two in the film). She and Richard married shortly thereafter with Louis as best man. A few weeks later she gives birth to Richard's son, conceived on that last night of passion at Rick's place.Laszlo, still a Czech citizen, was imprisoned under the notorious British regulation 18b as an undesirable alien. His true reason for wanting to get to America had been to set up an underground sabotage ring to undermine American aid to Britain. Major Strasser's secret assignment had been to ensure that Laszlo 'escaped' to America and to prevent his cover as an underground leader from being blown. In doing this he willingly sacrificed his own life by deliberately aiming wide at Rick so allowing Rick to fire the fatal shot. Postscript: after the war Rick opened a bar in the sleazy Soho district of London, laconically calling it 'Bar of the American Patriot'.Sam's piano playing was performed by Elliot Carpenter http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0139325/bio.",10,0,0,27 December 2002
Gone with the Wind," The Decamping Husband's Farewell
","GWTW is a woman's picture about feisty Scarlett and the men in her life. Ostensibly about the American civil war, it degenerates into a story of marital disharmony, recognisable in any era with its overtones of women's lib.David Selznick's MGM background leads him to mimic their films which predominately reflect the lives of upper middle class American society. Scarlett comes from the upper echelons of the cotton plantation owners and when Ashley goes to fight the Yankees he becomes a Major. This is an unusually high rank for a young man with no previous military service;likewise Scarlett's first husband, Charles Hamilton, becomes a Captain.Most young officers would have been second lieutenants. GWTW is atypical as it does not therefore represent the life of the ordinary fighting man. This fascination for the affluent in life reflects Miss Mitchell's own life since both her father and second husband were lawyers.The film opens with Scarlett and her friends jabbering away at nineteen to the dozen. This fast pace of dialogue continues for several minutes making it impossible to catch much of what is being said. Eventually the film settles down to a more acceptable pace. All of her beaux seem to be West Point graduates which reflects Miss Mitchell's day dreaming at 15 of being a boy and entering West Point.Mr. Howard as Ashley is so bewilderingly miscast that it is hard to understand why another player could not have been found. He comes over as a father figure rather than a newly wed young man. He looks his age (45) and is far too serious; he rarely laughs or jokes and is never frivolous.Of the supporting actors, Thomas Mitchell plays Scarlett's father very convincingly and his Oscar was well deserved; in a smaller role Dr. Meade is very well played by Harry Davenport. Miss Mitchell probably based him on her own days as a beginning medical student.The film is so drearily long because the plot is structurally unsound. The first part deals with the Civil War in a conventional way but only as it affects the privileged few. In the second part Scarlett eventually marries the likable rogue Rhett, based on the real life blockade runner Charles Trenholm, but after the birth of their only child she forsakes her marriage vows by excluding him from the marital bedroom. To which Rhett, obviously seriously hurt emotionally by Scarlett's rejection, responds 'You know I could divorce you for this?' Forget about the Civil War from here on it's just the well-worn story of battling embittered spouses. Miss Mitchell's mother had been a suffragette and this seems to have rubbed off on her and her novel. One night a drunken Rhett, carries her upstairs in his arms to bed and ravishes her. This has parallels in Miss Mitchell's own life as her first marriage was annulled after she suffered the same fate from her husband.I have not read the book but at over 1000 pages in length it has been considerably condensed; one major change is that Scarlett has three children by Rhett compared with just Bonnie in the film. This significantly changes the situation when Rhett leaves her with his oft-quoted farewell 'Frankly, my Dear, I don't give a damn' (a simple but effective piece of alliteration), a similar emotion must have passed through the mind of many an exiting spouse. Scarlett is left alone with no children compared with two in the novel. However this is where both the novel and the film end. Was this done to make Rhett's departure more morally acceptable? The entire film revolves around Scarlett and Rhett but although Scarlett is in almost every scene it is Rhett who is the commanding presence and steals all his scenes. At the beginning of the second part action drags without Rhett and Miss Leigh fails to hold her audience. The tedium which sets in could have been relieved if there had been a sub-plot to the story. This is an essential element of such a long story and is a weakness of Miss Mitchell's novel.A further weakness is that there are too many convenient deaths. Characters are killed off willy-nilly when they hinder the story's development. Very early on, Scarlett's first husband, Charles Hamilton, dies after a short illness. Later, her second husband Frank Kennedy is conveniently killed when they go out to a 'political meeting' concerning shanty-town raiders and get involved in a skirmish with Yankee soldiers. There is the death of Bonnie which lets Rhett off the hook morally as there are no children to support after he leaves Scarlett. The death of Scarlett's mother of typhoid fever is acceptable. This is another parallel with Miss Mitchell whose mother died of Spanish 'flu. Melanie conveniently dies in childbirth leaving Ashley potentially free to marry Rhett after he eventually leaves Scarlett but both the novel and the film only make this point obliquely when Rhett tells Scarlett that 'all you need now is a divorce and your dreams of Ashley can come true.' Finally he realises he has seen through Scarlett's scheming ways and tells her ' you think that by saying: 'I'm sorry,' all the past can be corrected'. In fact, Scarlett loves no one; she is incapable of love and just loves herself. She proved herself to be unsuited to married life as she rejects the act of procreation and behaved like a vixen throughout.The story would have been more true-to-life if the clergy had been represented, especially in the hospital scenes.The film is more outspoken on marital matters than the feature films of the period. It also makes it clear that the 'saloon', a centre point of westerns, is not just a place for men to have a drink, gamble and brawl but is a bawdy house.The restored DVD has a sharpness and clarity previously unseen and I recommend it to any fan of GWTW.",7,2,5,5 January 2009
