Hereditary," Too slow for its own good.
","Recent reviews i had read insisted that this film was described as a whole range of things from an original classic to a terrifying horror and even a game changer that's as scary as The Exorcist. I've even seen people tell me that they are horror 'veterans' and found this film to be one of the scariest they have ever seen. Clearly in this case, they are not horror veterans; and i imagine they probably found something like Gremlins to be utterly horrific.As you can probably tell after seeing these reviews I had hopes going into this movie. I wont say high hopes because I've been let down too many times by those kind of reviews before.To start with the positives, the acting in this film is as good as it gets from veteran actors Toni Collette (who is outstanding) and Gabriel Byrne to the younger actors in the film who played their children. The acting is so good that i felt the trauma and the tension within in that they themselves were feeling which is a really heavy concept throughout the entirety of the film. So A* for that. Also, something I liked for the first half of the film is that there lies this eerie silence that builds up tensions but at the same time this is part of its downfall which leads me on to the negative aspects. The constant feeling of something feeling like it maybe going to happen looms around for way too long and in the end the error in this pacing leads you to become tireless and honestly, quite bored. In the cinema me and my friend turned to eachother wondering when some thing was about to happen, not just in the jump scares department but in its storytelling. The film goes on for way too long before you even have any idea what the plot actually is. All we really know is that there has been a trauma and it isn't until its too late, where you've almost began falling asleep (which may be a tad harsh) that a thing or two, literally, happen. A case could be made to slot this film into the drama category as opposed to the horror/thriller genre.All in all i don't want to spoil this film too much for anyone. The film has terrific acting but its lack of plot and scares leaves you with little to take away from this experience. I believe that the film thinks its better and more original than it actually is, and in the end doesn't come close to the all time classics like The Exorcist. 5/10",3,4,9,20 June 2018
Fight Club," Fight Club? I'm in.
","This film is sensational! Although funded by Hollywood, its one of those films that feel really anti-Hollywood and stick a middle finger up to the people behind it and to other powerful companies of the world. As much as it's about fighting, its about the way we live our daily lives. It's quite philosophical in a way. It discusses consumerism, capitalism, crisis in masculinity and all other themes. It's not just about the fighting but even when it is, it's fairly brutal and excuse the phrase 'kick ass'. But its true. The acting is great, the story is great, and who saw that ending coming? I haven't seen a film give me the same buzz as this. I don't mean a buzz to go out fighting or whatever, but a buzz just sitting and watching the story unfold. It really is a masterpiece and I'm not sure how it could be improved, but hey there are going to be people hating on this film and calling it 'controversial' or in bad taste because of some of the things included in the film but lets just stick a finger up at them! If you haven't watched this film already, then unless you have a good excuse, you have missed out on a great piece of cinema. MUST WATCH",10,0,0,29 June 2014
The Babadook," Far from the usual..
","I first saw the trailer for The Babadook around October time last year and I was instantly attracted to this movie.. The trailer suggested a spooky and retro theme which late horror film lack in a way, being all about scares and what not. I had high expectations of this movie, and in a way I left feeling somewhat disappointed. The acting is on point, and if the Oscars paid attention to any film beyond the drama category, we'd definitely have two contenders right here. However, this is a horror film and with horror films come scares, which this movie really lacks! The first half is slow, perhaps to gain a connection with the two central characters, and it isn't until around the middle where we see occurrences begin to unravel It does build up and the last quarter feels like we could be promised a look at the 'babadook' or at least some action, which we have little of, but ultimately the ending is VERY bizarre. To those wanting to see a film for lots of scares and tension, this isn't your movie. But, if you want to watch something with a lot more depth and emotion on a psychological level, you should settle for this.",5,9,30,6 November 2014
Suicide Squad," For once, the critics got it wrong for me.
","Like most people I was sooo excited to see this movie ever since its announcement some few years ago. So, when I heard the critics reviews I became slightly concerned especially with those that rated it worse than BvS as I was one of many who thought that the film was a bit of a disaster. I'm more of a fan of Marvel than DC (please don't bash me for this!) but I appreciate a good superhero film when I see one despite the brand it belongs to and to be fair I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as much as i thought I would before the input of the critics.The characterisation in this film is brilliant. Margot Robbie as the wonderfully crazy Harley Quinn stole the show for me. All her scenes were interesting and she produced some good comedic moments as well as some great action scenes. It was fun just watching her do her thing. Will Smith was surprisingly good as Deadshot which I was a bit on the fence with when he was first announced. The rest of the cast play their roles well and the chemistry between them all is fantastic and it was fun to watch them interact with each other. Leto's joker is great from his laugh to his mannerism. I loved his and Harley's scenes together. I felt he brought justice to the role but he's not in the movie enough for me. Jay Hernandez is a treat as El Diablo and his backstory along with all the other characters backstories were well presented and one of my favourite parts of the film. The story is good but sometimes falls a bit flat, leading me to discuss some of the few minor problems with this movie..Firstly, the editing is too fast paced in some parts and is very jumpy in others. I think some scenes needed to be played out better without all the fast paced cross cutting in the action sequences and with some of the interactions between the characters. Some of it felt a bit rushed. Secondly, some of the characters are sold a little short. Slipknot and Boomerang feel a bit pointless at times and sometime you wonder what they're actually in the movie for. Finally, Jared Leto's Joker isn't in the movie enough for me. I happened to think he was a brilliant Joker and loved all of his scenes but a lot of what we, as an audience, were sold with his scenes in the trailers were not in the final cut of the film. Hopefully we see a lot more of him in the future.Despite the few flaws, this is a fun and very enjoyable film. A real enjoyable ride. If you go into the film with an open mind I think you'll enjoy it as I did, and this is coming from a MARVEL fan.",7,1,2,6 August 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Nothing special I'm afraid.
","Perhaps I'm being slightly harsh when i rate this movie a 6/10, but honestly I don't think its deserving of anything more.The movie contains some good action sequences that we'd expect from our wall crawling friend, and the film has heart, but there is too much lacking with the final product. Andrew Garfield is a good spider man, and Emma Stone an equally good Gwen Stacy..and I have no problem with Sally Field either. However, i feel that the casting of the rest of the cast was completely wrong!Jamie Foxx as electro? He would have made a better'Kraven the Hunter'to be honest, and what the hell is up with the appearance of electro? I felt like I was watching Dr Manhattan from Watchmen. Dane Dehaan i like, but he doesn't compare to James Francos Harry Osborne, and i think they could have chosen someone better. I don't really feel like we got anywhere in the story of his parents or Oscorp to really care, or feel excited for the next one either.I'm a huge MARVEL fan, and in particular Spider Man and admittedly this reboot does feel more like the comics, but in all honesty, as much as I really didn't want to slate this movie, the original THREE were better than this one. Obviously everyone has their own opinion, and i respect that, but this felt way too rushed and was rather plain.",6,8,20,25 April 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Darker, Smarter, Better!
","Age of Ultron is a spectacular Marvel instalment to end phase 2 of the ongoing superhero project.All the familiar faces we've seen so far reprise their roles as lovable misfits who come together to put an end to HYDRA. Everything that the first Avengers movie had is doubled in this one. There is the oh so familiar clever wit which we have come to recognise within these films, tons of great action scenes where every Avenger gets their moment in the spotlight, and a new nemesis in Ultron who proves to be a formidable opponent, and the toughest the team have faced so far!James Spader provides an intense and intimidating voice for our 8 foot iron giant, ultron, whose presence throughout the entire film is exciting to say the least. The other editions include the Maximoff twins who add great visual powers. In the previous films they relied on punches and energy blasts whereas with the twins we are introduced to new powers we haven't yet seen. Its fresh and adds a new dimension to the story and the universe.One thing i particularly enjoyed (without giving away too much) was the development of Hawkeye. We see a lot more of him and his background in this movie as opposed to the first Avengers movie, and of course the 5 minute cameo spell he had in Thor.I constantly felt excited and intrigued watching this movie as there was never a dull moment. It really is an epic, full on spectacle. Another aspect i enjoyed is that although Stark is the centre of the creation of Ulton, the story never solely focused on him as the first Avengers tended to slightly. The time on screen for each character felt even, although i do wish we saw a bit more of Thor who didn't seem to have as much dialogue even though he was present for the most part.Overall, this is a fantastic film which sits comfortably in the top 3 Marvel films to date.",8,4,11,25 April 2015
Midsommar," Just like other cult films, this is strange.
","A few years go i remember seeing Ari Aster's Hereditary in the cinemas. I was very excited to see it due to the reviews i had seen. However, by the end of that movie i was actually quite annoyed that I was pulled in by the same old tropes critics use for these kind of 'artsy' films by claiming it was a new classic. It certainly wasn't. Anyway, i decided to give Aster another chance after i thought the trailer for this looked very interesting. So here's my review:First of all the acting in this is fantastic. Florence Pugh is the stand out in this as she goes through every emotion possible in this film and makes it feel believable as to why she feels a certain way at certain times. This is one of the things i DID like about Hereditary - the acting. Another thing to praise is that visually it's quite a stunning film. Every shot in this film feels like it was seriously thought out and in a strange way kind of makes you feel happy which i think the film is trying to do in a very strange brainwashing way. Almost to make us feel how the characters are feeling. Another great thing is that it's not the kind of film that relies on jump scares to make you feel uncomfortable. A combination of acting, setting, and camerawork do it just fine.There are also some very funny moments in this. Will Poulter cracks a few jokes here and there but the main laughs in this film i think may have been unintentional. Without giving anything away, there's a lengthy scene towards the end that had my entire cinema laughing out loud. Its safe to say its definitely quite silly in some parts.That said, this film deals with some of the same themes as Hereditary which is where it falls apart a little bit. Themes such as grief, paranoia, and sacrifice. The story doesn't really evolve too much and you can guess early on where this film is going to go. Also, like other strange cult films, there is never a satisfying explanation/conclusion to the film. It doesn't give enough for the viewer to really understand what the hell just happened.Because Critics loved Asters previous film, lots of them talk highly of this one too. However, that's the weird 'artsy' part of themselves talking who think a slow burn is a bright burn.Overall, I did find myself enjoying this film mostly for the reasons stated previously. It is a very well made film. Just dont expect to see anything you haven't seen before (except maybe that one hilarious scene i briefly touched upon!). It went on for probably 30 minutes too long and could have done with a more well developed story. If you liked Hereditary i think you will like this. If you didn't then you'll probably still have a more enjoyable(?) experience.6/10",6,1,2,9 July 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Dull Vs Dull
","So DC has begun to bring all the heroes together just as marvel have done and kick off the Justice League with Batman Vs Superman. I'm a fan of Snyder and I thought after watching The Watchmen several times that Snyder could bring that dark, edgy kind of thing to the batman universe. However, this is ALL he really brings.First of all there is no real character development (which some may prefer especially with Wayne as we've seen it a thousand times) and we have no real back-story on anyone apart from Superman which we've already seen in Man of Steel. The first half of the film is super dull (excuse the pun) and the film doesn't really get interesting until around the last half hour when the fight begins. Then onwards it goes from a poor film to an okay-ish, still slightly disappointing film.The good surprise or surprises in this film were Jesse Eisenberg as Lex and Gal Gadot as Wonderwomen. Eisenberg was deranged and quite creepy and every time he was on screen I became more interested in his behaviour and motivations. He kept the film interesting. As with Gadot, she stole the limelight every time we saw her. BUT, that isn't enough to save this film which we've waited years for in anticipation. DC have rushed it with trying to form the justice league, lacking depth and story. Did a little joke here and there ever hurt anybody? They're failing to copy what MARVEL have managed to do so well over time. Maybe it's too soon after the Nolan series for it to work.Fanboys will tell you this is the best superhero film they've seen because they refuse to believe that this was a dull affair.",3,2,5,26 March 2016
