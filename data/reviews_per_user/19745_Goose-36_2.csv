Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," AMAZING
","After many years of waiting, finally the phantom menace is upon us and Lucas has outdone himself once again.  The movie is simply amazing.  If you can put aside some of the not so great acting scenes, you will simply love this movie.  Star Wars is like nothing else out there and the Phantom Menace is the perfect first installment of the series.  Go see this movie many times.  Don't expect this movie to explain everything though, the Phantom Menace is setting up the next two movies and it does a very good job of it. Best scenes - the pod race and the final 20 minutes of the movie.  These scenes will simply make your jaw drop.  This movie appeals to the kid in all of us.  I loved it.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
Mission: Impossible II," Woo woos you all over.
","Sure it was over the top,  sure it was a bunch of crazy nonsense, but I wouldnt have wished for it to be anything else. Woo directs this film masterfully and Cruise excels (well somewhat, it just seemed a little weird watching him do cart wheel kicks) but so what, it was as far from being real as possible and thats why you gotta love it.  Its a movie to sit back and let dazzle your eyes with magnificent spectacle. The story ain't bad either and it will keep you satisfied. dont read the critics reviews, they're just synacle #%@holes anyhow. This movie was completely different from the show, and not that close to the first movie either, as it should have been, it has aged with the times now go see it.",8,1,1,25 May 2000
