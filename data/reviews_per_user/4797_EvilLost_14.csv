Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This isn't the same Star Wars that I remember...
","It has the Star Wars name. It has the Star Wars characters. But sadly, thats all it has.  FAR too much graphics and not enough effort was put into Phantom Menace, this film loses a great deal of the original loveable Star Wars. Though still enjoyable, and a must see for fans of the series, it is in no way a match for the original trilogy.",6,0,1,27 October 2002
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Enjoyable but the ending loses it
","A man and a woman, brought together through coniving coworkers, each of them with a different goal in mind. Ben needs to make this woman fall in love with him in order to get a large advertising account and a promotion, and Andie is writing a 'How-to' article on well, how to lose a guy in 10 days.Needless to say they actually fall for eachother, but on their way there Andie goes through many typical cliched things which women do that drives men crazy, and as such Ben is forced into doing many things that men don't want to do in order to make her 'fall' for him.Even though the last bit of the film was a little stringy and only there to bring the story to a close, the rest of it was still fun enough to watch.Slightly reminded me of the beginning of When Harry Met Sally, depicting the differences between men and women,although relatively cliched, in an entertaining enough film.",6,3,6,12 April 2004
The Others," Intriguing
","Tho there is not much that happens in terms of plot, the atmospheric effects (especially with the touch of the childrens photosensitivity) added for a great suspense movie.Horror fans however, this movie is NOT scary at all. Maybe one or two jumps, but nothing truly scary.  However, the suspense is great, atmospheric elements are amazing, and tho I am in NO way a Nicole Kidman fan I gotta say she was quite good in this film (only film I'm willing ot say that about :)Good acting, good atmosphere, good ending not much in terms of plot though Overall: 8/10",8,0,0,24 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Bigger battles, better effects, and a big finish
","Finishing the story of Star Wars, ROTJ has much bigger battles and specials than either of the predecessors, however the story is considerably more predictable, though this can't necessarily be helped as its pretty obvious what would happend :).  Oh, and don't forget the Ewoks!",8,0,1,27 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," HUGE improvement!
","After the great disappointment of Ep 1, this film greatly recovers some of that lost star wars spirit. Though there is still too much graphics and not enough creativitiy, Ep 2 is beginning to catch up to the original trilogy (though nowhere near as good). The film in itself will mean nothing to those who haven't seen the others in the series, but for anyone who has this is an action packed (and unlike the first one, WELL DONE) movie.",7,0,1,27 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good, but not that good...
","Though in itself a great movie of a great story, it simply lacks too much. Yes the movie is 3 hours long, but in my opinion they shouldnt have cut all the developmental scenes (primarily all the scenes with the characters travelling) in order to achieve a shorter runtime. 2 2 hour movies, or even a 4 hour movie properly telling the story of the Fellowship of the Ring would have much improved this film.For those of you that havent read the book, the film stays relatively true to the story (which is rare in hollywood..) but cuts many of the 'smaller' scenes, which I find had important character interactions.Though I happen to love it, those who are not much into the realms of fantasy might not like this movie much (my dad got bored and slept through the last hour of it). Nonetheless, still a great film, though perhaps not for everyone.",7,0,0,1 November 2002
Alien vs. Predator," Good film, good story following, POOR DIALOGUE
","I am a huge Aliens fan and a relatively big Predator fan. I also loved the games. So obviously I've been waiting for this film for quite some time. This project has an IMMENSE name to live up to, and the probabily of continuaty errors (sp?) is very high. But to my surprise, its not that bad!The Bad: Directing was a bit weak, a film of this stature required a much more talented director..but most any director with some talent could have done a better job, at least one whose skill was equal to the hype of the film.The Humans, their dialogue is just plain stupid. Character development is near nonexistant as well.The Good: Aliens PredatorsCONSISTENCY!!! When combining two major series, especially such as this, plot holes tend to appear left and right. However, as I watched it I failed to find a single such consistency error. The predators and aliens lived/fought/etc exactly as their previous movies had dictated them to do. I had a great fear of mistakes going into this aspect but it pulled out incredibly well and overall made me enjoy the movie alot more than I otherwise would have.",6,0,0,14 August 2004
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Nothing more than fancy effects
","The Lost World is a great disappointment.  The story is VERY loosely based on the novel (which is a great book, and a worthy sequel to Jurassic Park) and the only thing keeping this movie going is the special effects.
Should the movie have followed the book I think this would have been a great sequel, however due to its terrible change in story, I suggest you skip the movie and just go read the book.",6,1,2,28 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," If you're a fan, you'll love it
","Though not exactly following the books, Two Towers has excellent action and of course continues Frodo's quest. If you are a fan of fantasy in any way I think you will like this, however do *NOT* watch this if you have not seen Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.These movies are a trilogy, however unlike other trilogies (i.e. Indiana Jones, Star Wars, etc) this trilogy is more of a continued story. Where the first movie ends the second starts, and if I recall correctly the commentary by Tolkien in the novel states that he intitally wanted it to be one large book, but due to lenght it is split into 3 parts. In other words, this is technically 1 9+ hour movie (once Return of the King comes out :)",7,0,0,24 December 2002
The Dark Knight," Ledger is fantastic; the rest is boring and forgettable at rest
","EVERYONE said this was good, and I mean everyone. So I went and saw it (luckily with a free ticket). Needless to say, I was so disappointed I had to write this review.Firstly, Ledger is amazing. Every time he spoke the screen captured my attention. I completely underestimated his ability throughout the film.Secondly, the plot has many MANY **MANY** (read that: MANY) plot holes. Its like swiss cheese. I don't wish to write any spoilers, but suffice to say that nearly every scene, while they do contain transitions, is just barely connected to the previous. Dent's makeup was a bit over the top as well I felt.-------------The REAL problem with Dark Knight is the film itself. The plot, for how grainy it is, is still connected and very dark; yet the film is always BRIGHT. In most scenes everything is well lit, whites are shining, etc. This is easier to see while watching the film, but it felt as if no manner of actual camera-work was done to set the mood. A simple filter over the shots, or the lighting moved to the background would have gone a long way...but nothing in any shot showed any real emotion - colors are just all very bland, and often inappropriate.",7,8,16,2 August 2008
The Matrix," Simply amazing.
","By far the BEST special effects ever done in a movie (and copied ten thousand times since) this movie is by far my favorite of all time. It has a thought provoking story, lots of paradoxes and symbolism for you who wish to dwell deep into the movie, and for those who dont? The Matrix has all the action, explosions, and special effects you will ever need. I have seem this movie 100+ times by now and with loads of different people, not one has ever said they didnt like it.Simply amazing.",10,0,1,27 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The beginning of the greatest story ever told...
","By far one of the greatest movies of all time, it has enough of every genre to be a hit, while tame enough to be enjoyed as a family film. Great special effects (especially considering when this film was made, simply amazing) and very creative characters.  I suggest the ORIGINAL Star Wars trilogy to everyone and anyone who I meet.",9,0,0,27 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The greatest story ever...gets better
","Arguably the best of the Star Wars trilogy, Empire Strikes Back continues the trend of Star Wars: A New Hope with more of the same hit specials and story.  Without wanting to give away spoilers, this film simply has all the twists and turns one would never expect. However, make SURE you have seen the original before you get to Empire Strikes Back, or you won't have any clue as to whats going on.",9,0,0,27 October 2002
Jurassic Park," Good movie but no match for the book
","Jurassic Park is a great movie combined with amazing special effects and a good story.  On its own I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an action packed movie for the night however it doesn't particularly have anything to 'think' about.  The movie is nowhere near as good as the book (which is my favorite book of all time), and I personally suggest anyone to read the book over the movie.But if not, still a great movie.",7,0,1,28 October 2002
