Catch Me If You Can," Intriguing, perceptive, touching, and funny!
","The wintermester of award winning films has finally arrived and I'm thankful for that.  Having a chance to watch Catch Me If You Can ten days before its worldwide release was both rewarding and worthwhile.  Steven Spielberg has perceptively created a true story, a period piece full of life, a colorfully captured era, a touching story of broken bonds between parent and child (especially that special relationship between father and son), an amusing chase of cat and mouse, and alas a trip that was so unpredictable and intriguing it makes you stare in awe and wonder.  Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank Abagnale Jr., a young teenager who lives with his parents (Christopher Walken) circa 1960s and is adjusting to his families financial downfall after his father loses his former job and consequently his parent's divorce. After his father opens a bank account for him, Frank runs away from home to pursue a fake life of fraud checks and fraud identities.  He pretends to be a co-pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer, steals millions of dollars in the process, and falls in and out of romantic escapades.  Meanwhile, FBI detective Carl (Tom Hanks) is hard on track behind Frank's many adventurous schemes trying to catch him. While the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat with its humor and fast paced entertainment, it also manages to be touching with one of its most important themes being the father son relationship.  Frank Sr. (Walken) teaches his son Frank Jr. (DiCaprio) that 'there are two mice who fall into a bowl of cream, one mice quickly gives up trying to get out, the second mice keeps struggling, continues and never gives up until he manages to get out by turning the cream into butter.'  This is Frank Sr. biggest lesson to his son.  But Frank Sr. is convinced that his son is not a criminal and he won't turn him in to the police simply because he is his son.  Frank loves his son too much and the only way that his son knows to repay his love is by buying his father a new Cadillac and offering him some money.  It's interesting how Frank Jr. thinks that his parent's divorce and the destruction of his family is caused by the lack of money, which is exactly what causes him to pursue exactly that: money.  He wanted to save his family or at least make sure that his never suffered because of lack of money. The music by John Williams is giddy, fast, and bouncy which reflects the sneaky endeavors of Leo's often weasel of a character.  DiCaprio, Walken, Sheen, and Hanks all bring a knockout showcase, even though Hanks' southern accent is often annoying.  Many of the scenes take place around or on Christmas day which make the movie sort of a holiday treat.  I will not reveal the ending which ends kind of abruptly.  I must admit that it did left me wanting to see more of the relationship that flourishes between Hanks and DiCaprio. But I was thoroughly entertained.  This is a sure thought-provoker and a must-see for the holidays, especially anyone who admires its cast and crew. (9/10)",Null,0,0,15 December 2002
The Ring," Gripping, Compelling and Scary!
","Sensationally scary and ultimate suspenser about a news reporter (Naomi Watts) who is trying to find the cause of the death of four teenagers who were killed exactly seven days after watching a video clip of disturbing images.  Her son is psychologically connected to the mysterious secrets behind the killings.  Problem starts when Watts watches the video and a thrilling countdown of seven days ignites to unravel the mystery.  To reveal more about the plot will ruin the incredible thrills and chills.  The editing is choppy but the script is carefully controlled and Watts is nothing short of amazing in the lead.  Everybody does a fine job, but Watts is the driving force in the movie.  The story is so interesting and told with such visual flair, one becomes a reporter like Watts in this mysterious and hypnotic caper.  One of the most outrageous and courageous psychological horror films in recent years.  Truly heart-stopping and exciting.",9,0,0,15 October 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A sweet story of friendship and faith!
","Steven Spielberg has created a fairy tale for the 80s as a little boyElliot befriends a lovable alien creature from outer space in one ofthe most loved movies ever made.  Spielberg carefully recreateswhat could be any boy's childhood fantasies and carefully weavesthem into a story about family in the suburbs trying to hold ontogether after their dad leaves their mother and heads towardsMexico.  Dee Wallace is perfect as the depressed and yet lovingmother of three, a teen, a little boy (Elliot) played memorably byHenry Thomas, and a little girl (a never more appealing DrewBarrymore).  E.T. (The Extra Terrestrial) is left stranded on earthafter his spaceship leaves him behind and he becomes a survivorwith the help of Elliot, whom begins to literally feel all of the alien'semotions.  Problem comes when government agents are on thehot trail to capture E.T. and Elliot and his friends must help get E.T.back to his home planet.  Undeniably one of the best movies of the80s with movie magic to spare.  Spielberg's 'feel good' happyending and idealized happy family after broken bonds is evidenthere.  Witness the powerfully told story of love, friendship, family,and ultimate sacrifice.  An originally comic and heart-warmingmovie for all ages!  10/10",Null,0,1,21 October 2002
Citizen Kane," Blazing, Powerful. An Ultimate Cinematic Triumph.
","Courageous, powerful, smashing, sharp, passionate, dark, terrific, epic, visionary, tough, grand, brassy, emotional, and flawless.  Orson Welles' Citizen Kane is a cinematic masterpiece of editing, montage, acting, story-line, music, cinematography, and directing.  It is a milestone in motion picture history and Welles directed, co-wrote, and starred in it at the age of 25.  Story's plot covers a man's ascent into the corrupt world of politics and the greed that lies in the newspaper industry.  Then story shifts to the lost of his friends and love of his life.  It is the unraveling story of a banal and self-absorbed man that has lost his beloved 'Rosebud.'  That in itself is an intriguing mystery and pretext that will keep you guessing up until the final haunting scene in the movie.  Those low shots and high shots and the astonishing black and white cinematography with striking blackness gives the film a touch of surrealism.  The script is powerfully written and all the actors do a wonderful job.  Hailed as the first modern sound film, Citizen Kane is the work of a visionary filmmaker that will be loved and treasured for years to come.",Null,1,2,14 October 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Grand, Spectacular Science fiction!
","2001: A Space Odyssey is still the grandest of all science fictionmovies, the most visionary of all Stanley Kubrick works.  Its themeof humanization is enticing and powerful.  Story covers a giant leapfrom the age of the ape man to civilized space.  The movie is avisual dream, a spectacle of lights and special effects that areawe-inspiring and captivating.  The musical score is masterful and adds a great intensity to the mood of the film.  And did I mentionHAL is just a machine that is represented by a menacing red light,and his commanding scene presence makes him one of the mostterrifying of all screen villains.  Its a story about the life cycle, theduality of man, man vs. machine,  suspense, horror, the future, inshort an iconoclastic society.  It is a must-see movie that must beviewed with patients and pathos, one that is the definitive vision ofthe art that is filmmaking.  On a more personal note: Kubrick'satmosphere has been critized for being cold and banal.  Such adehumanizing place makes the movie even more emotional for mytaste.",10,0,2,18 October 2002
Singin' in the Rain," Funny, Colorful, Entertaining!
","Probably the greatest musical ever made (and also one of the greatest comedies), Singin' in the Rain is the definitive form of entertainment. Starring screen legends Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor, Singin' in the Rain was released in 1952 as an all musical, all singing, all dancing extravaganza.  It truly is.  It is probably the greatest feel-good movie of all time.  Kelly and O'Connor have a great musical duo with 'Moses Supposes.'  Add Reynolds and you have the classic 'Good Morning.' O'Connor's 'Make 'em Laugh' is a scream and hilarious.  Kelly has his unforgettable 'Singin' in the Rain' number where he literally tap-dances with an umbrella under pouring rain.  Jean Hagen, as Lina Lamont, was the only actor to be nominated for an Oscar and is truly the standout in the film providing most of the laughs as a brainless and obnoxious blonde with an annoying high-pitched voice.  The film is a perfect showcase for showing the transition from silent films to talkies and all the mishaps that came along with the period of the late 20s and early 30s.  Witness the romance, the dancing, the music, the singing, the comedy, the profound impact of the greatest musical entertainment of all time!  10/10",Null,2,5,18 October 2002
Pulp Fiction," Audacious, Iconoclastic, with Vitality to Spare!
","One of the best movies of the 1990s is probably the most unique in the sense that it stands by itself in its audacity and vitality.  Quentin Tarantino is an auteur of the 90s and has proven a masterful director for great ensemble casts, an insightful well-developed script, inspiring and striking camera angles and cinematography, and has developed a new genre of gangsters, crime, and mystery with an array of violence, drugs, sex, and fast-paced action.  John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are dynamic and deliver powerful performances as a duo of hitmen, Bruce Willis is compelling (in one of his finest roles) as a prize-fighter and struggling boxer, and Uma Thurman is memorable as a sexy drug addict.  All these lowlifes are connected in one way or another to big time mafia leader Ving Rhames who happens to be Thurman's husband.  Movie is also unique in the sense that it is broken up into different scenes that don't seem to go in order from beginning to end.  Obviously the movie is not for all tastes for its dehumanizing and repulsive theme which is evident in every single scene. Nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture, Pulp Fiction is a mezmerising ride.  9/10",Null,0,0,20 October 2002
