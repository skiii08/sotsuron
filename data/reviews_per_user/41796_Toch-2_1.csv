Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Boring Menace
","Time Magazine had it right when they called this disjointed, uninspiring mess the Phantom Movie. I don't remember an action adventure film of the Lucas caliber falling this flat. If you want special effects that's one thing, but this one really offers more than anyone would ever want, it's almost insulting, that's all there is to this Lucas monstrosity. The jokes weren't even the slightest bit witty and after an hour and a half I couldn't take the spoon fed plot (what plot there was) and the gobbledygook dialogue from that stupid horse headed baffoon of a character any longer--so I did what I almost never do, I walked out. The flat unconvincing dialogue from the rest of the crew was also a  real surprise. I didn't give a lick about what was happening to the Jedis, the little boy or anybody else, and that's too bad b/c what Star Wars was supposed to do-I thought-was get you on the edge of your seat. A real snoozer......",4,0,1,10 June 1999
