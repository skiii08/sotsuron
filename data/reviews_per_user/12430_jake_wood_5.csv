Blade Runner 2049," An excellent sequel
","Such a tough act to follow with the original becoming iconic.Blade runner 2049 has brilliance of its own.It touches on concepts that really suggest another leap further into the future.The hologram companion, Joy. She says everything you want to hear and visually presents everything you want to see. Upgrades include making the hologram more portable, an anniversary gift K gives her. The idea of merging the hologram with a human body to be able to have sex too is weird but interesting.The genius villain, Wallace is played well. Gets the balance of someone with a god complex with all the nefariousness needed to make your skin shiver.Throughout all of it you know the replicants are reluctantly carrying out their duties. Even Love, Wallace's partner sees the immorality of his approach.This film and others captures the fear of advanced technology making life more depressing for us. Creating societies where things are increasingly replaceable.",9,0,8,22 September 2019
Memento," My favourite Christopher Nolan film
","The film is pure artistic genius. I've never seen a move flipped into reverse chronological order work. Not only is the sequencing original but the themes it explores really interest me. You imagine yourself in his shoes, desperately seeking to remember what happened the day before. There is something about memories that has always fascinated me, as we are shaped by the amalgamation of a series of memories. That is what makes Inception, another Nolan special gripping - exploring the idea, what if we could plant these memories inside someones head? Also, the acting in this film is great considering how tricky it must have been to play these roles",10,0,0,8 August 2019
Once Upon a Time in America," Cinematic masterpiece
",I can see why people wouldn't like it. You have to really be into movies and appreciate the way in which scenes are set throughout to fall in love with this movie. I love the character development of Noodles and his tight relationship with Max. It is their acting chemistry which really makes the movie great for me. Despite it's length you are still engaged throughout and I haven't seen a movie of similar length which has held my attention in quite the same way except for Tarantino's Django Unchained,8,2,11,8 August 2019

Joker," Makes You Think
","Centered around mental health.A topic receiving greater attention, as people begin to feel more comfortable revealing the true extent of mental illness within society.The acting performance is gripping. You can feel his torment and empathise with his failure to fit in. There are times when it can be difficult to watch.It captures the failures of the system, inadequate treatment, a lack of care for how Gotham treats the downtrodden and afflicted.It's a movie that makes you think. Although awareness of mental health issues has improved, treatment and understanding has not. I've known many people facing their own struggles, including people taking their own lives which has shocked me.When you approach the movie through the lens, you start to think about how close we are from incidents, murders prompted by such failings.There's one question or line of thought it sparked. Evil is not inherited but created. By how societies treat, react, respond to misfits.Watch this movie!",10,0,1,4 November 2019
