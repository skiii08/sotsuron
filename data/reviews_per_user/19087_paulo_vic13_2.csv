Resident Evil: Afterlife," Not as good as it could get
","The first 3 Resident Evils, to me, were the best movies ever made, and that's why i gave them all 10 out of 10!This one was a disappointment: There's TOO much slow motion, it's very short and looks A LOT like the video games (which would be a good thing, but it looks too much like a video game)! Also, there's barely a story behind the action and the characters are TOO fictional!I gave it a 5 out of 10 because it's Resident Evil, and Resident Evil is epic! If it were any other movie, i would probably give it a 3. Even though i said all of this, i recommend this movie because it's Resident Evil and it's still good, but i would try watching it in 3D, because it looks a lot better (that's the one thing good about the movie, the action parts look AMAZING in 3D).",5,1,2,7 July 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Another PERFECT Transformers
","This Transformers movie does justice to the other two! It has a great story, great special effects, great casting! The only thing missing is Megan Fox!Don't get me wrong, you'll love Rosie Huntington-Whiteley too, but Megan Fox was a part of the Transformers!This movie is PERFECT in 3D, and i recommend everyone to watch it in 3D, it's fabulous, great special effects, i think it's the best 3D movie since Avatar!This movie has a lot of action, a little romance and you'll get to know a little more about the story line!One of the best movies i've watched in 2011",10,2,6,7 July 2011
