The Longest Yard," The biggest and meanest come together to beat on the rest of the biggest and meanest!
","This movie takes the over proportioned cast from the original and ramps it up a bit. Some of the largest men in Hollywood, the NFL, and professional wrestling compete in one of the most brutal games ever to hit the big screen. The best part is this movie also has some of the biggest laughs to hit the big screen in a long while. One of the problems with a movie remake is the comparison of the two. This movie overcomes that by holding true to the original, keeping a faster pace, and throwing more laughs than footballs. This movie can almost be categorized as violent slapstick. With some heavy hits laid down by heavier players. Paul 'Wrecking' Crewe has a lot to overcome. With the help of the convicts and their 'special' skills, this team of inmates realize they actually stand a chance.Adam Sandler steps out of his typical goofball roles to deliver a great performance and shows some real acting abilities. Straying from the same antics, gibberish, and violent rages that made him famous, it is great to see him in a role with feeling. Sandler does a great job of bringing humor and attitude to the role.The Longest Yard is without a doubt a great movie to break out the summer box office. This movie is poised to be big. Gauging the size of the actors, this movie will be huge. Bigger is better, this movie proves it. In the day of 5'4' heroes like Tom Cruise, Bruce Willis, and Colin Farrell, this movie backs the old adage you can't teach a guy size. However you can teach him intensity, attitude, and how to steal a car, break and enter, pick pocket, and go to jail.",7,2,7,27 May 2005
