Catch Me If You Can," Vacation time for serious actors
","This movie was an absolute delight.  It is lighthearted in tone (with a touch or two of darkness), breezily shot and acted, and painted in a kaleidoscope of '60s colors.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks get to retire their serious acting chops for a bit and seem to be truly enjoying their roles.  The supporting cast is strong from top to bottom, especially Amy Adams as a clueless naif and a heartfelt turn by Christopher Walken as DiCaprio's father.  Concerning the story, the tale of Frank Abignale, jr. (DiCaprio) is as much a yarn about mankind's willingness to trust someone who says all the right things as it is a commentary on how confidence opens doors which, for you, should rightly remain shut.  Spielberg, who has been producing heavy, ominous fare for the last decade or so (Schindler's List, Amistad, and Minority Report, just to name a few), puts a sense of magic and enjoyment into his movies that calls to mind earlier work like E.T.One final note:  it's also amazing to note that what Frank Abignale did could never be duplicated--because of Frank Abignale himself.  You'll have to see the movie or read the book to understand exactly what I mean.",8,0,1,3 February 2003
Memento," The end is but the beginning of something amazing
","I write this commentary in March 2002, long after the nominations for the Academy Awards for this year have been announced.  My biggest feeling of disappointment was in the exclusion of Memento from just about every category save for writing and editing.  I have read reviews of the nominations, and most of them said that Memento was excluded for being 'gimmicky'.  The argument, they say, is that since the storyline runs backwards from the end to the beginning, it limits the creativity possible. Hogwash!  So what if it's a gimmick. Why not reward them if the gimmick works? It does, here, to perfection.The backwards-running storyline produces many moments of 'aaaah, so THAT's how that happened!', feeding important pieces of the plot to the viewer in a patchwork style that keeps the viewer involved.  This is not a movie for the easily distracted, as most 'gimmicky' films are; this is one movie best viewed on DVD or VHS simply because there are many scenes so dense that you want to rewind them and watch them again. As the hero, Guy Pearce's performance fuels the entire story, expressing a full range of emotions and often juxtaposing opposite feelings from one scene to the next.  The writing, directing, and editing are top-notch, intelligent, clever, humorous, and, when needed, brutal.  Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano deliver excellent supporting performances, although this is becoming mere habit for Pantoliano.Memento didn't find a mass audience because it is too intelligent for the average movie-goer.  But if you don't object to actually investing a bit of yourself in the process of watching a movie, see Memento.  It is far and away the best movie of 2001, and may be the best new movie I've seen in five years.",10,0,1,4 March 2002
Total Recall," Whether it's a dream or reality, it's Ah-nuld's best flick
","When Total Recall was released in 1990, I snuck in to see it lying in the trunk of my friend's Pontiac Phoenix.  It was my 17th birthday, and for it I received a conundrum:  was what I was seeing on the screen what was really happening to the character, or was it simply a manifestation of memory implants that he receives early in the film?  Nobody can definitively answer that (and because my review is to be free of spoilers, I shall refrain from delineating my response).  But regardless of whether or not the movie is supposed to be real or a dream, it's Schwarzenegger's best work.  For one thing, we don't have to suspend disbelief enough to think 'sure, the government would hire a 290-pound muscle-bound Austrian to do delicate undercover work' or 'sure, he could be an investment banker'.  Schwarzie's a construction worker.  And he can act in this film, which is better written (despite some cornball lines for the villains) than most of his other films. When he acts like an unstoppable hand-to-hand superman at the beginning of the movie, he is shocked and horrified at what he's done.  Find me another Arnold movie in which he expresses remorse! The movie has action, suspense, and some themes that inspire discussion long after the movie is over.  And although I don't normally care about such things, Rachel Ticotin and Sharon Stone pull off perhaps the best girl-vs-girl fist fight in movie history.  I give it a 9, and I'd rate it not only as Schwarzenegger's finest work but also that of Paul Verhoeven.",9,0,1,13 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," My passion is back
","Episodes III restored my passion for this series.Like many others, the original trilogy was a watershed moment of my youth; all I can remember of a trip to Martha's Vineyard at age four was begging my parents to take me to see Star Wars again. I was excited when Episode I came out, becoming one of many to make attending the midnight premiere a priority. After seeing it a few more times, I finally realized that I was trying to convince myself that it was good. It wasn't. Ditto Attack of the Clones. When I found myself standing in line for tickets on the morning of the premiere of Episode III, I also found myself asking, 'What the hell am I doing here?' The answer is simple: falling in love with Star Wars all over again. The first 20 minutes of this movie are on a par with any twenty minutes in the entire saga, with a space battle that makes the Pelennor Fields in Return of the King look like a back-alley brawl. The action sequences and lightsaber battles are second, visually, to nothing I have ever seen. While the dialogue (though much improved) was still clunky in spots, the actors have adapted to delivering it more believably. The story was fantastic. Lucas has done a great job of bringing the saga back to where it began...and has done an even better job of bringing back the fire within me as a fan.One final note: Lucas also sent copies of Episode III to every major military base in Iraq, free of charge. This was not a PR move; I heard it from my brother-in-law, who is home on leave.",9,2,6,10 July 2005
