Hereditary," Wtf, really?
","I created an account just to leave a review for this movie. What disappointing trash. Why do people love this movie so much? What is the difference between my eyes and ears and theirs?
I gave it a 4 because I thought the family at least looked like it could be a family. The husband and wife were at least the same age.
Now on to my points.
None of this made any sense at all. I mean, at least TRY to make some sense, okay? If you want us invested in the characters and plot, there must be motivation and reason. Even though this movie was 2 hours long, they couldn't come up with any.
Starts with a funeral. Toni Collette clearly hated her mom. Gives the rudest eulogy ever. Why? Eh, never mind I guess.
Her son wants to go to a party. Apparently he can't be trusted and drinks at parties? At least according to his mom. So he has to take his sister? She doesn't even want to go? She's weird and in elementary school? It's a high school party? And has a deadly allergy? And no epi pen? But no he has to take her according to mom. Maybe Toni is just a b!tch.
So hey guess what, no surprise at all, weird kid has an allergy attack and gets decapitated on the way home. Head knocked clean off!! Son drives the car home and just...goes to bed. Leaves the body in the car for the mom to find and she does.
No cops come.
Son just goes back to school.
No therapy.
They KEEP THE CAR.
Toni keeps telling her husband that she's going to the movies all the time because telling him she's going to a support group would be somehow worse than weirdly going to the movies? They never talk about what she went to see, nah, that would make sense.
Aunt Lydia pops up and has the same exact doormat that Toni's mom used to knit, that's noted by Toni and then it turns out she has a stack of knitted doormats with the family members names on them because that's typical, a whole family having individual entrances in a house.
Oh and guess what fat old people are naked at the end and somehow a 8x8 tree house can fit an entire cult in it.
The dad burns up and is probably glad because this b with the dollhouses is so annoying and seriously how much money does dollhouse art bring in anyway.",4,5,8,25 December 2019
