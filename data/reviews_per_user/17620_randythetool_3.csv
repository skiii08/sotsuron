Catch Me If You Can," Unimportant, inconsequential, and just plain fun!
","To be honest, there is nothing extraordinary about 'Catch Me If You Can,' Steven Spielberg's latest film.  Everything is good, and very little is great.  Even if the posters and trailers (and even the opening credits) hadn't told us this was based on a true story, we would know.  This is a tale far too clever for any Hollywood screenwriter to conjure, but we know that, even without the 'BASED ON A TRUE STORY' that pops up on the screen after the opening sequence.  Here is a film that will be big at the box office for a month or so, then pass out of our consciousness for a few months, until it is released on DVD, where it will linger for a few months longer, and then once again pass out of consciousness.  It's not a very memorable experience, but in spite of all of that, it's darn good fun.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr. a young con artist who in essence changes identities every few months, forges a load of bad checks, and makes the girls swoon at nearly every turn.  We see him go from substitute teacher to pilot to doctor to lawyer, with such ease that it is pure delight to watch.  Then we have the nemesis, Carl Hanratty, played by the always wonderful Tom Hanks, whose indistinct accent make the actual pronunciation of his name as mysterious as where Frank Jr. will be heading next.  Hanks is delightful, and doesn't steal any scenes from the obvious star, DiCaprio. Hanratty is an FBI officer, middle management in charge of bank fraud, and once he gets wind of this Abagnale fellow, we know that they will become enemies, and probably friends in the way we know and love, and have seen a thousand times before. Christopher Walken plays Frank Abagnale, Sr., Dicaprio's father.  Walken's character is down on his luck - in about ten minutes of screen time, he loses his car, his business, his wife (Nathalie Baye), and his son.  It was a wise decision for Spielberg to not treat Frank Sr. as a main character, because he is not. This is the story of Frank Jr. and Hanratty, and is treated so.The one thing that was still in my mind as I left the theater, though, was John Williams' score.  Being somewhat of a music enthusiast, I can always appreciate the oddball 7/8 saxophone trio, which is something you don't see much in movie music. Williams is probably the most famous of all film composers, and here I think we have his best work in years.  Overall, this film seems like it could have been done by any other director, and I was still a little in the dark as to why Spielberg chose this film to follow up his miraculous 'Minority Report,' but I saw little glimpses of genius in several shots. Consider the FBI office shot near the end of the film, and notice how any other director would surely angle the camera more at eye level, than the low angle used by Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (also of 'Minority Report').  It makes for a far more interesting shot, and there are a host of them throughout the film.  One thing Spielberg has a gift for is showing us something that we may not totally understand, but will always want to look at.I find it best to not think of 'Catch Me If You Can' as a follow-up to Spielberg's masterpiece, 'Minority Report,' because it's not.  This film isn't an exercise in character or style or anything else.  You can't analyze this film, because there's really not much to see.  It's a solid 140 minutes of entertainment, is always fun, and will definitely leave a smile on your face.  Now, I think it's time for Spielberg to get back to work.Three stars, out of four.",Null,0,0,26 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," An action movie based loosely in Tolkien's world.
","First things first:  before seeing this The Two Towers, you should rid yourself of the notion that it can compare to the novel.  Film translations of novels rarely do, and this is no exception. Now that you have that out of the way, you can prepare to be visually stunned by one of the most magnificent motion pictures I've seen, and be disappointed by the script that ruins it.Yes, that's right, the script that ruins it.  The Fellowship of the Ring was ambitious.  It was true to the text, as much as a film so 'hollywood' could be.  It was true to Tolkien.  It wasn't about the Uruk'hai combination of Orcs and Goblins, or Aragorn swinging swords, or Legolas shooting arrows - it was about a delightful cast of characters, all united in a common goal.  A fitting sequel to this film would be delightful.  Instead, we have The Two Towers, an action movie in Middle Earth's world, with a story similar to Tolkien's text.  Packed with one-liners, epic battles, special effects, and (believe it or not), explosions, The Two Towers is every war movie you've seen, set in a fantasy background, redeemed only by the most beautiful cinematography to grace the screen this year.Andrew Lesnie saves this film, plain and simple.  His camera shows perfectly how hopeless every character in this movie feels, or, are told they should feel.  His frame is dark and dismal, in green, blue, and grey through the bulk of the three hours - a great contrast from the bright colors of Fellowship.  In the first film, the characters showed us hope, and now, they show despair.  The Helm's Deep battle is magnificent to look at, but really, the rest of the film builds to it.  Lesnie probably should not get all of the credit for this, as Peter Jackson's directing is superb in its own right.  Jackson is unafraid to use all of the screen, and with the use of sweeping airborne cameras, he uses sometimes three or four times the size of the screen.The computer animation is first-rate, and there were times when I knew what I was looking at was false, but could not tell. Gollum's character is entirely computer animated, and provides the most interesting character in this film - in fact, one of only two.  Gollum is a split personality - his entire being wishes to have the ring, if you'll recall from Fellowship, but half of him wishes to help Frodo and Sam, and the other half wants to take the ring for himself.  I'm not sure if each personality has a name, but Frodo calls him Smeagol throughout the movie, so I would assume the good half is Smeagol, and the evil half is Gollum - the film is not clear on this subject.  Either way, Gollum/Smeagol talking to himself, across personae, provides the single best scene in the film.  Quite unfortunate that a host of human actors could not reach the emotional intensity of a series of zeroes and ones.The other interesting character is Theodan, King of Rohan, played quite well by Bernard Hill.  He is the only face in the film that truly captures how bleak the future is, epitomized in a scene before the epic Helm's Deep battle.  Theoden realizes that his army has no chance of defending their last stronghold, but has no other options.  His talent should have been served with better writing.  That would truly be something.The script is your standard action movie fare.  Dialog is swift, contains few details, and is rushed along to the next action sequence.  Elrond and Arwen, the elves, return for a short while in this chapter, which has little purpose in this film.  No doubt their scenes are more poignant in the extended version, which will be released next Christmas season, and, no doubt, be the same drivel we've seen in this 'shortened' version.I look forward to the extended version of this film.  I have low expectations, if the scenes we have here are the ones they decided not to delete, I'm not sure I want to see the ones they took out. However, where The Fellowship of the Ring earned three and a half stars from me, the extended version gets four.  Maybe The Two Towers' extension will get three.  I hope we're just being teased with The Two Towers, because I have high expectations for The Return of the King.  It would be a shame to see a project that started so ambitiously fall to the formula of the trilogy.",4,0,4,19 December 2002
Gangs of New York," A harrowing picture of war and its consequences. A masterpiece.
","In the tradition of war movies, there are certain elements that remain constant - the love interest, the friend who turns to foe (sometimes the foe who turns to friend), and always vengeance for some past wrong.  Martin Scorsese's latest masterwork, 'Gangs of New York,' contains all of these, but it's not a traditional war movie.  'Apocalypse Now' is one of the most effective war films ever made, but not because it's about war - it's about the effects of war, which, if handled correctly, are far more interesting than battle scenes.  'Gangs' has much in common with 'Apocalypse Now,' and yet, the two are not comparable.The plot is fairly standard fare for war films - Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) kills Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson), the father of Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo Dicaprio) when he is a young child. Amsterdam is then sent away for sixteen years, at which time he returns to his old stomping grounds, the Five Points, and swears revenge for his father's death.  During the sixteen year absence of Amsterdam, Bill the Butcher has become somewhat of a Charles Foster Kane in the Five Points.  Every business in the district pays tribute to him, and he controls pretty much everything from politicians to the fire departments.  Through chance, Bill meets Amsterdam, and without knowing his true identity, takes him in as a sort of foster son.  There are twists and turns, revelations and regrets, but I will leave you to see these yourself, because watching this film unfold is one of the greatest delights I've had in the theater this year.What we have here is a portrait of violence.  In the beginning of the film, we see Amsterdam look at his father and his gang, The Dead Rabbits, with a quiet awe.  Of course, he knows that his father kills people, but they fight for the right to live in the Five Points in relative peace.  We are given a glorified view of the war between the immigrants and the 'natives.'  Leonardo DiCaprio captures this perfectly, as the naive boy who is too hell-bent on revenge to see that his foe is not the monster he wishes he was.  Daniel Day-Lewis's Bill the Butcher reminds me of Paul Cicero from 'Goodfellas,' in that he's a good man with bad business.  He holds Amsterdam's father in the highest regard, calling him 'the last good man [he] killed.'  Every year on the anniversary of the first battle, Bill holds a ceremony to celebrate and honor Vallon's death.  Amsterdam sees this as an insult to the memory of his father, where Bill sees it as an homage.  The two become as good of friends as is possible under these circumstances, until the inevitable conflict comes to the surface.In 'Being John Malkovich,' Cameron Diaz showed us that she could act. Here, she shows us that she can act quite well.  I had my misgivings about her being in the film, but I can see that she was the right choice for the part.  She looks like someone whose been through enough struggle and still remains beautiful, if not flawed.  There is a scene which looks like the setup for a sex scene between her and DiCaprio, but instead of sex, we have the two comparing scars beneath the surface.  She doesn't know about Amsterdam's vendetta against Bill the Butcher, but she wants to take him with her to San Francisco, where they 'pull gold out of the river with their bare hands.'  She has been poor all her life, and, under the hand of Bill, she has survived.  Now that Amsterdam has been raised as Bill's protoge, she wants to take him away from the nonsensical fighting that is everyday life.In 1863, when the Conscription Act was passed, every man had to register for the draft, or pay three hundred dollars to save his life.  There is a scene of magnificent beauty where Irish immigrants come off the boat into America, enlist in the Army, get into uniform, are shipped right back onto a boat, which is returning with an endless sea of coffins filled with those who came over last week.  Riots ensue, thousands upon thousands are killed, and Scorsese makes an interesting point.  The men of the Five Points are willing to fight for their country, but on their own terms.  They fight an enemy with a face, and for their own reasons, not because a commanding officer tells them to.What Scorsese has done here will likely be hailed as one of the great war movies, and rightly so.  He has no illusions about war, and doesn't feed us with the glory of fighting for what you believe in. The only thing that war creates is dead bodies. The politicians in the picture complain of all the votes they're losing. Soldiers are recycled into coffins, rioters into a neverending line of candle light, and in the end, Scorsese says, 'it'll be like we were never here.'  Here is one of the best pictures of the year.Four stars, out of four.",9,0,0,20 December 2002
