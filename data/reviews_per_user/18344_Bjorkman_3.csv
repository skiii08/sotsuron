The Blair Witch Project," Scary? Not remotely.
","The Blair Witch Project was the biggest disappointment of the year.  After hype about being 'Scary as Hell,' I sat in the movie theater desperately waiting to be frightened.  It never happened.  There is little to push the plot along, other than ranting and raving by the three characters, and the occasional 'supernatural' occurrences seems exactly like what they really are: B-movie quality ideas with little effect.If this movie scared you, I hope no one pops a balloon or anything near you, you might have a heart attack from fright.",4,0,1,12 September 1999
The Fifth Element," The Fifth Element is, quite simply, incredible fun.
","There's something about this movie that just leaves you in awe.  The bright coloring, exquisite clothing, and high energy are just overwhelming.  If you try to watch this movie with any expectation of realism or believability, then you're missing the point.  This movie is about extravagance, fascination, and euphoria.  Giving a long commentary won't describe it well, it's just incredible fun.",Null,0,1,12 September 1999
American Beauty," Wow.
","Wow.This is film at its peak, I left the theater awed, and I don't doubt I will have an incredibly difficult time ever finding a movie that surpasses 'American Beauty.'  It bears repeating:Wow.",10,1,2,25 September 1999
