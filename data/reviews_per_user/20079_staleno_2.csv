Deja Vu," Has potential, but fails miserably
","This movie was embarrassing to watch. The thing that annoyed me the most was the fantastic time machine. Right, a video in HD-quality with sound that can be fixed in every possible angle and even zoom in so you can watch the digits on a phone display. Inside a house! And if you put something that stupid in a movie; don't try to explain it using real physics. It just makes matters worse; especially if you know physics. And this video system from the past was something a couple of guys had put together in a couple of days. Not to mention that these guys were the typical ubersmart morons you see in every sci-fi B-movie.I tried to look beyond that and enjoy the movie, but it was hard. Denzel and Val Kilmer's performances are OK, but the rest of the actors are somewhere between bad and horrible. The story has so many glitches you lose count. But toward the end the moral seems to be that no matter what you do to change the past, the final outcome is the same; actually a clever idea (although not an original one). But then he sends himself back in time (yeah, likely) and saves the day and the girl (not to mention himself). Seriously; the ending was a complete disaster. In the end nothing makes sense at all.Finally; who the heck was the bomber anyway, and what were his motives? I gave this movie 3/10 because it was partially entertaining. But it was mostly annoying. Do not see this movie unless you have a 13 hour flight and nothing else to watch. Or you can have a competition and see who finds most glitches in the story.",3,60,98,2 February 2007
Superbad," Mildly entertaining
","If you're looking for an uncomplicated and funny movie, Superbad does the job. The characters are witty and the dialogue is sometimes hilarious. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera both performs decently as the main characters Seth and Evan. Personally I think the two police officers, played by Bill Hader and Seth Rogen, were priceless, and performed far better.The first half of the movie is actually quite good comedy. You are taken along on a ride alongside three high school losers that are willing to go to great lengths to score with the girls, and get involved in several messed up situations. The second half of the movie is unfortunately terrible. The movie turns into an American Pie clone with the stereotype brainless girls that are ready to get down on the first loser they pass along the way. The second half is also packed with scenes that are painful to watch, due to both the awkward settings, the awkward acting, and the awkward script.Despite a promising start, the movie ends up like a standard highschool comedy that you've seen many times before. And finally: why do they insist on using 25 year olds to play high school kids? It's so incredibly lame.",5,4,6,2 January 2010
