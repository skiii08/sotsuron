Sucker Punch," One of the worst possible movies I ever expected to be good!
","From the makers of good movies like Watchmen and 300 comes the tragic loss of artistic vision packaged up and handed to the public as Sucker Punch. I usually never review movies that I absolutely can't stand simply for the fact that I don't want to waste ANY more time on the piece of crud.But this movie, I come back to, seeing all these idiots rave about what an amazing action packed movie this is, and just remember how hard I laughed as my girlfriend and I watched this movie. It has nothing in it either true OR enjoyable for both male and female audience...at least of an intelligent mental capacity. Stunningly horrible plot and with the mix it being a terrible cast of bad actors and just plain dumb writing the movie flopped.I would recommend you never even step foot near this title to save yourself some time, money and brain cells.",1,4,10,20 December 2011
Grindhouse," Rodriguez takes gold.
","I just got back from a midnight screening of this movie. I have never been more disappointed in Tarantino. He has the crowd by the balls just because he is Tarantino and now he is using his fame to f-ck around and make this half thought out undeveloped load called Death Proof. What a waste of time, that second movie. The entire storyline sucked, the actors were very annoying and worst of all the dialogue went on for so long people started leaving the theater. I stayed and watched the entire drawn out second movie. Wow, the violence in the second one even sucked. He has pulled off the long talking scenes in other movies, but that was in movies that had actual plots like Pulp Fiction!!! This sucked! The story is about a guy who drives a car around and kills people. This wouldn't be that bad, but the trouble is it takes 50 plus minutes to get to the killing, while in the meantime we are watching the most ridiculous things. It's not art, like his last movies.Rodriguez however, made the hilarious Planet Terror, which blew me away! It was funny and personally I think he should be the headliner of the show because the gore and great humor impressed the crowd a lot more than the nonsense in the second movie.",10,5,11,8 April 2007
