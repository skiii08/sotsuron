It," Fantastic horror film!
","I was very excited to see this one. I been waiting for more than a year after it was announced. So I am happy to tell you this exceeds all expectations! Let me begin with Bill Skarsgård. He was amazing as pennywise! I mean very very menacing, creepy, and played his character so great! I adored the kids in this movie! They had great chemistry, and you can really buy that they are best friends! Something I loved that this film did was it didn't have any exposition. It was all visual story telling. You can tell what scared the kids, without them just saying '(this) scares me' they develop their characters until you eventually find out on your own. There are many scenes or moments that finally tie into the story at the end. I loved the effort put into this movie! And of course, the horror in It is so scary! Not the typical jump scare, false scare, loud noise, predictable scare fest we are used to with a majority of horror films now a days. The scares were very unique! Some people might complain the scares were too over the top, but it's supposed to be imagination. The emotion towards the end works so well. It made me feel sad. And last, the humor worked so good! It was very funny and all jokes landed! I would say my issues with the film is I wanted more screen time with pennywise. He wasn't in a lot of it until the third act. And my last issue, I wish there wasn't as many jokes and whatnot during scenes that are supposed to be frightening. But other than that definitely go out and see this one, good date night, or hanging out with friends! You will be chilled to the bone!",9,7,14,17 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Very good even for a non star wars fan
","So I have never been a star wars fan, never seen any seven of the movies. But my uncle who is a huge star wars fan wanted me to come with him, because I love movies and all the great reputation with this one and the force awakens from last year, I was pretty excited to see it. And sure enough, my expectations were not let down this is a great star wars movie, definitely looks better than the three prequels (based on what I heard about them) the story was very great and very well handled I was still able to understand it despite me going in blind to the theater which I think is a great pro about this film. The whole plot is just written very nicely. And let's not forget about the action scenes,in a word stunning. The CGI is probably the best Hollywood has to offer today and for a majority of them, my knuckles were white with tensity, it was fantastic. This movie's sets, along with the shooting and lighting was gorgeous and I absolutely adored it. All in all definitely see it, rogue one is worth your time and money. You deserve it bring your spouse, date, friends, family, or kids and you will be in for a pleasant treat!",9,0,12,26 December 2016
Creed," One of the best films of 2015!
","I'm a big Rocky fan, so I had high hopes for this movie. I really enjoyed all 6 of them, I was excited when I heard of this. Creed is a lot like the first movie. It had many lines, scenes, and plot elements like the first one. But also it was a lot different than the original franchise. It focuses on not only fighting but problems of life. Had really touching moments and action moments. This will likely win an Oscar. I really like how they made this film. Just great production! Sylvester Stallone and Michael B Jordan were awesome in this movie! Really unpredictable and well written out. One of the best stories for a film ever. I suggest a 10+ rating as it is more parental then the other six films. Good for an older family and date night! Definitely a must see!",9,9,15,27 November 2015
Thor: Ragnarok," Yet another home run by marvel!
","Thor 1 and 2 are usually thought of as the weakest in the MCU. Those movies are still good, but I do have to agree with that statement. So I am very happy to tell you, this movie is such a step up from 1 and 2! It's a rare example of the 3rd installment being the best in the trilogy (marvel also did that with civil war). Thor ragnarok has such a unique plot and expands the universe with endless creativity which was my favorite part of the whole movie! As always Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston were fantastic as Thor and Loki. They had awesome chemistry together. The villain, I am happy to announce had motivation and development to her. They have a reason for her to be evil. I have a few issues of the movie like the villain doesn't get much screen time in the first two acts. Also, they didn't developed a threat or conflict to well in the first two acts. But the final battle is amazing with some emotional weight put into it as well. All in all Thor Ragnarok is such a fun ride! Do yourself a favor and check it out!",8,2,7,12 November 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," This film was absolutely incredible!!!!
","I am a huge fan of Spiderman, I love the original trilogy (yes even the third one) I really liked Tobey Maguire and felt he did a great job. I think the Andrew Garfield films, while enjoyable, really lacked the tone of a Spiderman film. So I can tell you, this was easily my most anticipated movie of 2017, but I do have to remember that I can't keep my expectations as high as a drug addict. So as the film started, while pumped, I also was just praying it would be awesome. So... I AM VERY HAPPY TO TELL YOU THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!! The entire time watching it I had a smile on my face! ☺ First off the acting is great, Tom Holland was born to play this role. All his friends, the villains, and of course Robert Downey Jr did awesome like always. Next the action, the web swinging sequences, the high flying fighting and intensity was all handled so well, Marvel always achieves greatness with that. You can really feel the brutality and fear of the characters while watching. Let's talk about Micheal Keaton as the vulture wow! What an incredible villain! He was very intimidating with the suit on but also, a terrific character underneath the suit. While I am a fan of the MCU I do agree, a majority of their villains suck. But Keaton really was different. He had so much depth and motivation which I adored. And there is one big shocker towards the end which even put more emotional weight towards his character. This movie is not just another marvel movie. Spiderman Homecoming is very unique and special in its own way. Of course the CGI was great like always. The story was written in a way we can all adore. There are so many twists and turns and unexpected paths it chooses to take which was the right direction. And last, the humor was hilarious! Laughter is the best medicine. Peter's friend Ned was a addition that fit like Cinderella's slipper. Spiderman Homecoming is definitely the best Spiderman movie to date and I say you definitely should go out and see this one!",10,141,275,8 July 2017
Split," M. Night Shyamalan is back!
","So hearing good reviews about this movie and the fact that Shyamalan's last movie The Visit was decent, I was generally excited to see if the hype was real. And I was not let down! This is a really good and original film. We have hardly seen anything so unique like this in horror movies these days. Shyamalan's direction and screenplay are both excellent. You can really tell he put a lot of effort in making a good film to please us. James McAvoy was such a great casting choice! He did an outstanding job as Kevin with 23 different personalities. Anya Taylor Joy also did great. Her character was well written. The screenplay had a great story that kept us on the edge of our seats! My only issue is that the climax while I admit it was scary, I found it unrealistic compared to the realism of the entire rest of the film. Before I go I just want to also say the direction of photography was very unique and was done in a way I adored! Definitely go see this one, it's worth your time and money!",8,2,11,11 February 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Got to be Marvel's best yet!
","I was very excited for this movie, and was eager to see it and when I finally did, oh my gosh I was absolutely blown away! This was one of the best movies I had ever seen in my 14 years of living! Every MCU film is great, but this is by far it's most perfect! There is not one thing I disliked about it. Acting was awesome, CGI the best Hollywood has, it's shooting and lighting were outstanding. Everything worked for it! 110 percent effort was obviously put into this movie. Whatever Marvel's doing there nailing it every single time! Action scenes were very tense, very entertaining, and an on the edge of your seat ride. I cannot see anyone hating this movie at all. Every single scene had a surprise or was just pure amazing! Tom Holland as Spiderman is the best since Tobey Maguire! Homecoming is bound to be great. As usual, Robert Downey Jr was terrific as Tony stark same with Chris Evans as captain America I adored every second of civil war. It's a must see for sure. I recommend you see it as soon as you can. Bring the kids, your date, friends or spouse. And I promise you will not regret doing so. Best film or 2016!",10,4,10,17 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," Definitely scarier than the first!
","I was really counting on this movie to raise my scare level to the top, and if you haven't seen this movie, you have no idea what I am talking about! Oh my gosh, this film was freaking terrifying! For three years I was plagued with nightmares of the first movie, and i didn't think any movie could be more scary. Conjuring 2 definitely proved me wrong! Not only were there jump scares but REAL horror, not just being startled by a loud noise but James Wan shows us what real horror is. There were many rising suspense scenes and you have no idea what will happen. That is what scary is! Demons are what true scariness are. What lurks in the darkness is something to be terrified about. And this movie shows us this perfectly. Like I said it does have jump scares, and I appreciated that, why? BECAUSE NONE IF THEM ARE FALSE, they were not a cat jumping out or a character popping out, every single one was real and lived up to the rising suspense that was built up. Not only is it scary but it is an awesome story. As a matter of fact a TRUR STORY. It was very well told and unlike most horror movies today it actually had a PLOT. The twist in the end is brilliant, unpredictable and pieced together the plot elements well. Also greatly shot, greatly acted and great character development. Unlike most horror movies this has Likable CHARACTERS. Unlike most horror movies it's not a gore fest or has countless swear words, it's rated R JUST because of how SCARY it is. I love James Wan he is terrific at what he does. Every horror director now days NEEDS to see the insidious trilogy and of course the 2 conjuring movies. This has restored my faith in horror movies! I definitely recommend it. See it with your spouse, friends, girlfriend or boyfriend (definitely do not bring your kids) and you will have the thrill of a lifetime! By the way you might want to look under your bed tonight! ðŸ˜‰",9,67,114,14 June 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Definitely the best since the first!
","The first pirates of the Caribbean is one of my all time favorite movies, unlike lots of people I really like Dead man's chest and At World's end as well. But like most people, I found on stranger tides a massive disappointment. So I was anticipating this movie for so long and when the reviews came out, I was very heartbroken. Regardless, I still went to the theater and was praying it would be good, and I am so happy to tell you the critics are dead wrong! This is a terrific film! As always, Johnny Depp as captain jack sparrow was great, and also loved the characters of Henry Turner and Carina Smyth. They both did great jobs and unlike on stranger tides, this one has characters besides captain jack, that I was interested in. Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar was so menacing and such a cool villain. He actually has a lot of depth and motivation to his character unlike Blackbeard. Critics are saying this film is 'boring' but I did not find a scene that dragged on and I was very invested in the well written story of this film. My only issue with the film is I wish they would've given captain jack sparrow more to do with the plot. But other than that I think you should definitely see it and do not listen to the critics!",9,4,12,28 May 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Definitely see it!
","Marvel has once again impressed me. This was such an amazing movie. The best was definitely the humor. Laughter is the best medicine, everyone in the theater was laughing out loud the whole time! The characters had great chemistry together and I adored them. I also loved how they also included emotional weight to the film. Star Lord, Gamora, and even Drax had some drama included to their characters which is a great thing. The story is interesting and the action scenes look fantastic! I suggest you definitely see this one!",9,0,2,7 May 2017
The Witch," Not scary nor entertaining
","OK I went into the theater with high hopes of a terrifying tense film that will disturb the crap out of you. Good reviews also were a key thing to this expectation. I walked out of the theater well... disappointed. It will not scare you or even entertain you. There are many horror movies that don't scare you but can still be a good time to watch. This isn't any of those. I have to get it credit, for its incredible dialogue, and how it's shot. Based on the time this takes place, they did a great job on making it appear as though it is in that time. The dialogue is the same as well. But the plot is confusing, you will eventually get lost. It's not really a horror movie until the final 15 minutes. The rest is just a boring story of a family surviving for the winter. This film is so dead with zero tensity. It is hard to keep up and even get what, who, or why anything is. The ending is especially bad, you wait 90 minutes for something exciting to happen but nothing does. Just skip it. It will disappoint you. Waste of time and money.",3,7,17,21 February 2016
Finding Dory," Wow!
","When I first heard they were making a sequel to finding Nemo I really was not that impressed. Sequels is not really a Pixar thing, but eight years ago when I was in kindergarten, I adored finding Nemo. I am 14 now and wanted see it! And wow! I was blown away! This is a great Pixar movie! It blew away all expectations! I really loved the idea of it being in a aquarium instead of the open ocean like in the first one! That worked great! Pixar nailed the opening scene with baby dory! This movie has some flashbacks with Dory and when she was a child and I loved how they tied everything related to dory to her in the first one! It was very clever. It introduces new characters which are great and hilarious! Catlin Olsen, Ed O'Neill, and Ty Burell worked terrifically. It is a fun and well written story which can entertain adults and kids. It also has good morals and some serious parts to it as well. Kids can learn good lessons watching this movie. The characters are very likable too, Ellen DeGeneres as dory and Albert Brooks as Marlin gave great performances. You will also love how funny it is, not just the adult humor (which by the way was hilarious) but all the jokes can work for everyone! At the end of the day this movie was so awesome and so fun! Take your date or the whole family and you will love it!",9,1,7,7 July 2016
