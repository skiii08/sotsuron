Ford v Ferrari," This movie is just good. Darn good.
","Didnt realize hollywood could still make a movie like this. I'm actually getting bored of the superficial characters, large explosions, sleazy scenes, and empty emotions. This movie decided to just be good. Damn good. Bale and Damon lead a perfectly portrayed set of characters in this film that draw you in from the first scene and doesnt spit you back out until the credits roll.",10,3,6,23 December 2019

","Don't go on a space mission with Sandra Bullock. You'll end up with a hole in your face. I mean I would watch the movie again in 3D to enjoy the amazing visuals, but once this movie hits DVD then I can only rely on the bombardment of senseless dialogue and relentless pieces of satellite after satellite. Why have Ed Harris constantly remind the audience about Apollo 13 (a much more responsible and grown up space movie)? Why the constant Oceans 11 smart talk from the most experienced astronaut on the team while the Russian guy is bouncing around on the tether like a 3 year old? Why is Sandra Bullock in space after crashing every simulator she's been in and totally incompetent? And why is every important structure in space within 100 miles of each other and on apparently the same exact orbital plane? And this all started cuz the Russians clumsily blew up their own satellite with a missile?? This movie should be called 'World's Dumbest Space Guys.' You cant even call them astronauts or respect any institution portrayed in this movie as legitimate without completely disregarding the amount of intelligence and preparation that goes into actual space missions. In 2 hours I saw Sandra Bullock single handedly destroy half of NASA. Then she lands and almost drowns. My gf and I were laughing during this scene. I couldn't take anymore",6,1,3,3 November 2013
