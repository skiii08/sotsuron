Walk the Line," Joaquin is BEYOND sizzlin' hot as Cash
","To say that Joaquin Phoenix is brutally hot as Johnny Cash is to indulge in understatement. He is beyond hot. He is so sexy he left hot behind a long time ago and went into a stellar land of heretofore unimaginable hotness. Phew! Now that that's out of the way, this is a good film. Reese Witherspoon does an excellent job as June Carter and good lord, is June's behavior an example to us all. I dream of being able to be that polite, but I just can't do it. The warmth in the move comes from June and her family. They are just marvelous. The pain and the creative drive comes from Johnny Cash and Joaquin Phoenix shows the tortured soul and deep needs of that creative genius.",Null,1,4,18 November 2005
The Mission," Make sure you sit through the credits!
","One of the most powerful parts of this deeply moving film comes at the end AFTER the credits. Make sure you sit through the credits so you don't miss it. It would be a shame to miss it. I am not sure why the film makers put it there; perhaps it's a comment on patience. I think it's more likely that they KNEW people would be so awed by this film and so in love with its music (the music is so beautiful) that they would not leave their seats; they knew they would sit there until the credits were over. Anyway, I feel so strongly about people not missing this part that I am posting about it. That glorious music plays throughout the credits, so it should be no difficulty to sit through them and wait for the important last message.",Null,1,1,2 December 2006
