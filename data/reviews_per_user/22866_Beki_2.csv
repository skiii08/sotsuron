Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not what I expected, but that's not a bad thing...
","Well, what can I say? This film was just a few marks from excellent! Certainly, there were some boring scenes, and at times I was wondering to myself, 'why did I come to see this? I could have seen the Matrix.' But when it got good, it was just brilliant! The graphics and special effects of this film were, quite literally, out of this world. I particularly liked the underwater scene, seeing all the different monsters. I loved the creativity of it all! The colours, the costumes, it was all so much fun!Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, and the girl that played the Queen, their performances were all commendable. I expect it was so much fun filming, too.",9,7,9,17 July 1999
The Mummy," Childlike fun!
","Watching this movie, I felt as though I was 5 years old again. It was great fun. Trudging through the desert on a journey to find some lost treasure, doesn't that just happen in cartoons? Obviously not.The performances from Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weist were very good, and amusing, too. Sometimes it seems hard for 'top' actors/tresses to pull that off.I completely recommend this film to anyone who is a child at heart.",7,0,0,17 July 1999
