The King's Speech," percentage shot
","I have just seen The King's speech, the movie who won some Oscars in 2010. I have to say I was disappointed which doesn't mean the movie is bad, but it certainly isn't as outstanding as its ranking may suggest.The performances were good, but that was to be expected from such good actors. However the actors were playing stereotypes like we have seen too often in movies before. They were full of clichés like the Royal who becomes a friend with a normal citizen (message: restoring our faith in government) and shows that he is not a super human, even suffers from an impairment that can be overcome (message: if he can do it, you can do it, too).It's an average movie for the broadest possible audience - I would call it a percentage shot movie. Everything about the movie felt calculated. The story was predictable and I had the feeling I was watching an educational didactic play. Schools should show this movie to adolescents.There was nothing in its spirit to lift the movie and rise above the average, surprise me and make it memorable or at least linger in my mind, heart or soul for longer than the end credits.I am aware that my review places me in the minority but I cannot ignore the calculating and uninspired aspect of this movie.",6,1,3,3 January 2013
Black Swan," Solid but predictable expressionistic ballet thriller
","I must say I am not convinced this movie has really earned such an outstanding rating. It is not more than a solid thriller. Here are my reasons: An outstanding movie must have something unique and original about it - either the plot or the way of execution or the message behind it. This movie has none of the above. The subject (plot) is familiar and seen many times before: obsession and exaggerated ambition combined with a weak personality lead to a tragic outcome. In this version the setting of the movie is embedded in the world of ballet. I liked the ballet scenes and I was especially impressed by the expressionistic dynamics of the beginning (the dream sequence) and the end (the metamorphosis into the black swan). The rest was not more than a thriller with a predictable outcome (no twist, no surprises) smoothly executed and with good acting (as are all American movies). But...the movie didn't move me. It didn't linger for a long time in my mind...except for Natalie Portman's performance -it was impressive how she turned into a ballet dancer.",7,0,2,27 February 2011
Youth," mesmerizing and moving
","After the movie ended I could not bring myself to get out of my seat and leave the cinema. Soon I felt the urge to see it again for it has moved and mesmerized me.Why did this movie have such an effect on me? There are several reasons: One is because the movie stays physically very close to its main characters – similar to the movie Birdman but with other artistic measures. The result is the same though - you get sucked into mental web.Another reason is the way the main character is introduced - namely with a question posed to him. The storyline makes a full circle to get to the answer at the end of the movie. We are caught in this circle and taken along a philosophical journey through the meaning of life with all its important issues.A third reason is the director's talent for subtle comic insertions that loosen the seriousness. Sorrentino manages to show the tragic moments not agitated and with an understatement which Michael Caine is the ideal actor to achieve.It's not a movie about old people for old people. It's a movie about life for all people.A role as important as the characters are the beautiful musical score and the visual presentation: highly artistic and with a lot of power of imagination and creativity. There are unusual and unexpected combinations of picture and sound, never seen like that before. It all makes a well-rounded entity and establishes Sorrentinos own authentic style.This is an important movie to be ranked with Tree of life and Synecdoche New York.",10,9,21,3 October 2015
Crash," Capra at its best
","The movie Crash is s a fresh and original look at different people of different races in different situations.  One can compare this episode like movie to films like Magnolia or Babel. The movie is labeled as a race drama  but there are no stereotypes to be found. It's  surprising how the development  of the plot and the interaction of the characters is absolutely unpredictable. I dare say that in this movie the racial barrier is being lifted: we are all good and bad at the same time, we are all racists when we're down and generous when we feel strong. This movie depicts a world view that is similar to my own philosophy: Life is not predictable, there are no stereotypes in it. We aren't being punished or given credit for our actions by God (fate) when we think  we should. There is no justice and no sense or pattern in life that we are able to define or to foresee. But there is one thing in life: The capacity to hope, to believe in the good in everyone and in miracles ­ now and then. And sometimes a miracle will happen.I thought that nowadays there are no more movies like Frank Capra's any more. But this movie made me feel pretty close to it.",10,1,6,24 August 2008
Shutter Island," even better than the book
","Shutter island is a very good movie. It is visually striking, it is well casted and the story is told in a fascinating way, taking care of the the dynamic of the development as well as the message. You can watch it as pure entertainment and yet take something home with you to think about. The visuals are striking and the colors are exceptionally beautiful. The visions/hallucinations are intentionally treated by adding more color so they are more lively and intense than reality itself what actually is one of the important issues in the movie. I felt that the movie was well paced and I didn't think that there were made any mistakes in editing. Scorsese did everything aware of its purpose and certainly not as a result of accidental errors or sloppy work. The whole movie is shown from the perspective of the main protagonist and his point of view (or state of mind) bearing in mind that it isn't necessarily the truth. There was also a controversial debate on the musical score which I find fascinating and also absolutely well applied. This movie shouldn't be reduced to its plot twists or to compete who'll guess it first because it's so much more than that. The quality of this movie is that it can be interpreted in a lot of ways and people shouldn't fight about who's right. That's what makes a good movie – a lot of talk, a lot of ways to look at it and a lot of genres it can be put in. I personally will watch it again.",9,1,4,28 March 2010
No Country for Old Men," missed masterpiece
","The movie could have been a true masterpiece but instead it came out only solid - leaving some viewers not quite satisfied because of its promising first half. The killing of the main character happened too easily and too unnoticed, not clear what actually happened. Since the film was built up to follow the leading character, there should have been a more dramatic showdown. The sequence when the sheriff goes back to the scene of the crime was directed to seem important but the result left me guessing. At the end it wasn't quite clear who had the money, one could only assume it was Chigurh. After the shooting of the main character the film lost (or changed) its rhythm. I don't agree with some of the viewers that the very ending of the movie was bad; it was the whole last third of the movie that seemed to have changed its style. The end itself didn't disturb me. I had to read the book (which, by the way, is fabulous) to make up my mind what to think of the movie. A lot of people wrote that the movie was a very accurate adaption of the book. I don't agree. Maybe the atmosphere and the actors (which are great) are well transformed into a movie. But the film leaves out passages that are essential for better understanding: In the book the leaving out of the killing of the protagonist is better motivated and the scene where the sheriff goes back to the hotel is explained and resolved. We get to know more about Chigurh who is clearly not a real person but a symbol, a Punisher for the Greedy America. The sheriff (the main character of the book) and his monologues lead us through the book. In the movie they seem either too short (in the beginning) or too long(in the end) -there is not a good balance between the action and the philosophical scenes. It's a pity that the message of the story couldn't be fully understood because of the uneven pace of the movie and the badly cut storyline.I can understand people who say it's a great movie- they don't have the heart to rate it worse because they feel it had the potential and should have been a great one. Maybe the Director's Cut will prove them right.Rating: 6",6,1,3,28 April 2008
Revolutionary Road," Mainstream cinema with a touch of existential agony
","It makes me sad when a movie had the potential to be outstanding but only turns out OK. I was looking forward to this movie because I loved the novel. It had everything: a good story (the most important element), a good director, talented actors. Yet still the result didn't reach the books complexity, intensity and subtlety. Why is that? I think it's not enough just to take the written dialogs and put them 1:1 into the movie. The written material should have been better elaborated to visualize the depth of the agony. Too many times words were chosen instead of other visual means - or just silence. Sometimes less is more. If you compare it to The Hours (the middle story with Julianne Moore) you see how the characters are better expressed in a shorter time frame and in a more subtle way.  I liked more the first part of the movie that nicely built up the tension and set the stage. The second part, the final exchange of blows reminded me more of a boxing match (with words and punches) than of a subtle existential denouement.   The actors  were good, but not great. I liked Di Caprio's performance almost more than Winslet's, but neither of them could truly reveal the deepest secrets and fears of of Frank and April Wheeler. Sadly the result was too superficial, too conventional in its dramatic outline without any risk taken- almost too flawless.  It should be seen as an elegant and fairly successful piece of mainstream cinema whose main credit is to to give viewers something to think about and as an impulse for the brilliant novel to be read again.Not bad but not strong enough.",8,1,2,24 January 2009
Gran Torino," It's the deeds that count
","This movie is a one man project: Clint Eastwood, 78 years, main actor, director and creative brain behind this movie. It seems as if this movie is his final work and his last one - maybe not as a director but as an actor in his own movie.Hasn't he always been Walt Kowalsky? When he was younger he was Dirty Harry and later on Frankie Dunn, his character in Million Dollar Baby. In fact, these two movies are particularly similar because the characters are almost identical: They both dislike church, think badly of family and get attached to a stranger who becomes like a son / daughter to them. They have a soft spot under a tough shell.Many viewers have written that Walt's character changes throughout the film. I don't think so. I think people never really change and Walt doesn't either. In the beginning we don't know him so we judge him by his outside- his looks and his behavior: We don't like him. Throughout the movie we get to know Walt and in the end we even love him. We are the ones that change our opinion about Walt.  Gran Torino goes deliberately against all trends of today's world: Walt is an grumpy old men, impolite and primitive, he has bad manners and is absolutely politically incorrect. All these attributes make him a very irritating opposite of the so called ideals of today's public world: fashionable good looks, sweet talk, slick appearances and phony political correctness.   Walt (and Clint) doesn't like the direction today's world has taken. Its society is phony, weak and superficial.Talk is cheap. Nobody seems to deliver. He is ready for real sacrifices in order to make the world a better place? Are we?   It's such a simple story (some say it's too simple) but stuffed with so many important issues! Once you start thinking  you realize the movie has covered them all - mainly through Walt's character: sacrifice and death (redemption), real values (they don't make them as they used to'), religion, family (relation by choice'), the future vision of society (not the white race..).   In its own way it's a kind of a feel good movie even if there is nothing much pleasant at first sight. The message of the movie, though bitter, gives us hope and makes us feel right, because its heroic role model character teaches us the real values of life and makes a lasting impression.A movie must see for everyone!",10,3,8,28 March 2009
Avatar," eye candy with no substance
","It's very possible that this is an important movie in the field of CGI and 3D technology. In that category it is certainly a groundbreaking pioneer and it will have its followers. In fact it already has (life of Pi). The artificial world that was created was amazingly beautiful and imaginative. For this I give the movie all ten points.But in the movie industry there are different categories. More than half of the playing time - namely the scenes of the Avatar world - belonged more or less to the category of animated movies with CGI effects. It was made rather on the computer than it was behind the camera.The question is: shouldn't Avatar be treated and rated like an animated movie rather than a motion picture with real actors? Even animated movies and are judged as whole, not only for their outstanding visual execution.If you extract the whole high tech visual aspect of Avatar what is left of it?-average acting (except Sigurney Weaver) (- 1 point) -predictable story (- 1 point) -full of clichés: bad military people versus native peoples preserving nature (-1 point) -full of stereotypes: there are either good or bad characters (-1 point)If the Avatar world would have been replaced (and played) by some real Aborigines, this movie would have been neither noticed nor watched.I read somewhere that this movie is the equivalent for pop music hits: Today for the best tomorrow for the garbage.",6,5,8,16 February 2013
The Reader," ambiguous drama about guilt
","I have to write about this movie because I read so many comments on Hanna being a monster. Nobody is a monster in this movie. The message of the movie is: We are all neither good nor evil, we are always a mixture of both. The world is not a black and white place, it's not even gray - it's multicolored. And if anyone sees Michael only as an innocent victim, what about not telling  anyone about Hanna's secret? His statement could have saved her life.   Both protagonists  though in a totally different way - suffer from the same very human character flaw: They both have a secret they want to hide by all costs because they are ashamed of it. In order to hide this shame they both do things that are wrong. Their actions are somehow always human and understandable. (Whoever thinks he's above it suffers from an illusion.) They both eventually get eaten up by guilt and their lives take the course of their consequences.   This movie is a dark and ambiguous story that upsets our values of morality showing victims as possible culprits and culprits as possible victims. The question of guilt is not being easily answered here. This movie won't help you understanding life better but it will make you think about life and maybe your personal guilt.On one side there is the law - our justice. But there is a second justice system within each of us: We judge and punish ourselves more appropriate than any court of law could ever do. Sometimes our own morality is even more radical and cruel than the one of the 'law'. When we judge ourselves, we often get 'life' or even a death sentence - with no possibility of parole.Even though I read the book and knew the story I was deeply moved by this movie. I did not give it a ten only because in my opinion the movie only partially succeeded in showing the devastating impact that Michael's first love experience had on all his upcoming relations.",9,2,3,21 March 2009
Prometheus," A shadow of his former self
","Mr Ridley Scott has made a new film: Prometheus - a Science Fiction movie The title is promising: Prometheus is a figure from the Greek Mythology, the creator of the human race. Considering that Ridley Scott made some great films (Blade runner, Alien, Thelma and Louise) I was looking forward to seeing this one.What a disappointment! After a promising start and an impressive visual introduction à la Space Odyssey (interesting: Michael Fassbender) the movie gets more and more stereotype and predictable. The whole plot along with some scenes reminded me strongly of Alien. It seemed that Mr. Scott was counting on gaining new fans who didn't see Alien more than he was afraid of his old fans uncovering his lack of talent and originality.For someone who knew Scott's former movies, this was bound to be a disappointment: Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing that had a real connection with the myth of Prometheus, not once suspenseful. Instead: brainless entertainment packed with special effects - not badly done - but soulless like all today's blockbusters, boring and without any real reason of existence. A pale copy of his old movie idea in Alien.At the end, as was somehow suspected, the first Alien monster is born and it's clear that Prometheus was meant to be a prequel to Alien (how it all began) But all in all it made no sense at all.1 point for Mr. Fassbender 1 point for Noomi Rapace 1 point for the promising first 15 minutes.The rest is not worth mentioning",3,1,4,8 June 2012
Amélie," a feast for all senses
","This is one of my most favorite movies.Since there has been written so much about this movie (why it is so good) and since I agree with all of them I was trying to get to the bottom of another phenomenon.From time to time I read or hear negative, total irrational and almost hate outbursts about this movie and I ask myself why there are so many extremely aggressive negative reactions to such a charming movie. I think I have some kind of an answer.I think hardboiled realists are the ones who have extreme difficulties with this movie. They just can't cope with all the excessive fantasy and imagination in this movie. They are overburdened coping with a hero who is not mainstream, an outsider not getting along with reality and yet winning in the end.It's interesting to deduce from the hate arguments another strength of the movie: Outsiders should be encouraged to be themselves no matter what because they give the world its individual, original and creative mark and that's what makes this world so unique in its mixture of reality and spirituality.Bravo Jeunet.Bravo Amélie.",10,3,8,22 February 2009
Cloud Atlas," loop of reincarnation
","Cloud atlas is a very ambitious and carefully constructed movie with a strong and important plot line. It tells six intertwined stories in one giant loop meandering through the movie linking the stories together either by a visual similarity, an idea or a character.This enables the movie to develop an extremely well dynamic flow, almost like a vortex pulling you in making you care for the characters even if you aren't quite sure what they'll turn out to be....It's never boring and requires a big concentration and attentiveness to follow the multitude of players and stories.But people are wrong if they think there isn't an equally strong idea behind this plot driven movie.If you manage to watch the movie multiple times you will discover how well the stories are linked together. There is always a main protagonist in each story carrying out a task. The further we go in time the more important the task will be.On the other side there is the theme of reincarnation. It's a an original, charming and even a funny adventure to let the actors play their reincarnations! Sometimes in a story their lives end senselessly but they each undergo a journey that makes perfect sense in the larger context developing their soul and linking their past, present and future together in a loop.",10,3,6,28 December 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," soon to be a cult movie
","This movie is an absolute surprise! It starts as a dumb teen horror flick but then mutates' into something that looks like a Truman show rip-off only to end up like nothing you have ever seen before. It's an astonishingly original genre mix that is multi layered in its storyline as well as in its ideas and plays clever with clichés, stereotypes and archetypes.It's thrilling from beginning to end; full of ideas - sometimes too many to handle - you keep guessing what way the movie will turn and - unlike so many movies these days - you're not going to be right, not even in the last minute. Of course it's not flawless: Maybe at times it is just over the top, I mean flashy exaggeration of gore – in the best tradition of American movies.One could say it's a typical movie of our times because it is a synthesis of sociocultural phenomenons such as game and reality shows, big brother voyeurism, video games and phony politicians. It is in fact a cleverly disguised satire of all these phenomenons and at the same time a satire of its main genre, the horror movie itself.",9,1,3,13 October 2012
