Sucker Punch," unexpected...
","I honestly cant think what to write in this review that could politely say how pathetic this film is.. well i think that says it.. mindless, humorless, drab, and so on and so forth.. the only thing that had me sitting through the whole 109 minutes (oh yes i did) was the soundtrack. though the movie is not remotely as intense as the soundtrack, rock music listeners will have a treat here, but here I'm not giving you the reason to go watch this film.. just the only good thing about this film. The characters are strange and stupid. Emily Browning seems to have taken endorsements of make-up kits. Stupid script. average direction (Zack Snyder) (most of it is cgi.. like 300, but visually not so appealing), horrible acting, but the soundtrack, awesome. the direction was kinda like watchmen.. the style which seems to be his trademark.. I feel his best work till date was Dawn Of The Dead.. followed by 300. Period. don't waste your time on this..",3,5,12,29 March 2011
