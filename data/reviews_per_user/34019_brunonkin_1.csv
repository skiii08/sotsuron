Resident Evil: Afterlife," Good zombie killing
",I think this was good entertainment. It's funny that some people look this movie as it should be a deep as some Oscar winning movies. Ridiculous! It's also funny that some people who don't like the film give one or two stars! C'mon! There are also four and five stars available which also means the movie wasn't good. I'm fun of the games and I think this movie was more faithful to the games than any previous movie. Two previous ones were just awful crap. This one was far better. I also liked the idea it was in 3D. I like Ali Larter and she fit as Claire perfectly. One thing I liked about this movie that females were sexy without having big boobs! I also think Wentworth Miller was good Chris.Shawn Roberts was good Wesker. What I would hoped is more time for Chris and Claire. I hope they get more time in next movie. I also was disappointed how little time Sienna Guillory had. She only appeared at the very end. There's no need to look deeper meaning for this movie. It was pure entertainment and worked that way.,8,4,10,12 October 2010
