Resident Evil: Afterlife," Bad guy, Stan from the Matrix series??
","Could of been a good movie. Great visuals, but the story needed more effort. The story really didn't fit other movies. Nor did it really make sense on what mutation you can kill and not kill. How long have those guys been surrounded in that skyscraper, only to have mutants come up from the ground timed with the arrival of the 'Silent Hill' Executioner show up at the gate?But the bad guy, C'Mon. Matrix sun glasses, Cracking his next, the smirk, the attitude, talking like him. He even moved like him. It took away so much from the movie. I couldn't get The Matrix out of my head. Don't get me wrong, I loved the Matrix. I just don't like copied characters from other movies unless it was intended to be made that way.",6,1,2,21 June 2013
