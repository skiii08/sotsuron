Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The first 20 minutes of a mystery show
",This is a great movie but you have to look past the special effects and pay attention to the story line. You have to understand that this is not really meant to be a stand alone movie but more like the tv show LAW&ORDER as in the fact that in the first half hour they show you the crime and the second half hour the show you how they convict the person. Now i know this is a lame comparison but that is all this movie is supposed to be. An introduction to the starwars galaxy just imagine that you have never heard of DARTH VADER or LUKE SKYWALKER or HAN SOLO. If you do that i am sure you will enjoy this movie for what i think it was supposed to be. Now don't get me wrong i was at the movie theater for the 9am show and i have both copies of the trilogies and almost all of the original (1990's)toys. So like everybody else all i can do is wait for episode 2 and 3.,Null,0,1,19 May 1999
