Minority Report," A huge, unfulfilling lump of cheese.
","I've been had. I didn't fancy Minority Report in the first place. I don't like Cruise in his goofy action man mode, but the good reviews sucked me in and off I went. What a cheesy, cliched piece of garbage. Notwithstanding a few eyebrow-raising special effects, Spielberg's attempt at informing us that we're all in control of our own destiny is spoiled by one dimensional characters and a very predictable plot. All the caricatures are there:- the geeky nerd with a perm wearing shorts and a flowery shirt, the white-collared bad guy, the cute kid with a bowl haircut (you just want to slap), and Cruise getting serious. Even the tagline, 'Everybody Runs' was clearly just a promotional after thought, as John Anderton (Cruise) is the only pre-crime suspect that runs, and the phrase is embarrassingly thrown into the godawful script once or twice. A bad film (and in England, bad means bad, not good).",2,2,4,13 July 2002
Vanilla Sky," An essentially good, albeit flawed, movie.
","Vanilla Sky had the potential to be a modern classic, but is let down by mediocre performances by its leading stars, Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. Tom Cruise is not bad in this film, but never engrosses himself in his role to the level of Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia, where he captured a previously unimpressed sector of 'serious' film fans. He's gone back to the bright, white-toothed Jerry Maguire mode, a more universally appealing, but shallower, character. However, the Achilles Heel of Vanilla Sky is the totally inept performance of Penelope Cruz. To be fair, this is the result of a hopeless miscast, as Cruz's acting limitations are only part of the problem. In the movie the director, Cameron Crowe, expects us to believe that the shallow, hedonistic David Aames (Cruise) would drop the salacious Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) like a ton of bricks for the Spanish cutsie, Sofia (Cruz).",7,0,0,28 January 2002
