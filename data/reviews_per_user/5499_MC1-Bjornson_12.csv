The Avengers," The Avengers FINALLY Assemble
","'The Avengers', Rated 'PG-13' for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Adult Humor, Mild Sexual Innuendo, Violence and Mild Gore. Running Time: 2hr&23mns.My Take: *** (Out of ****) ---- On the IMDb Scale = 7/10 Over the last four years, movie-goers have known that The Avengers' was coming. It was inevitable. Since 2008, there have been 'cookies' (short clips usually appearing after a film's closing credits) in certain Marvel Comics based movies. 'Iron-Man' (2008), 'The Incredible Hulk' (2008), 'Iron-Man 2' (2010), 'Thor' (2011) and 'Captain America: The First Avenger' (2011). They served as the pre-cursors to this latest world-wide box-office phenomenon.At the end of each movie, there was a cookie with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate), who would eventually recruit these Marvel icons into the superhero team known simply as 'The Avengers.' This was truly a unique marketing strategy. It was essentially an ongoing 'in-house' ad campaign and now it has finally paid off.Presently, 'The Avengers' has grossed over $381 million domestically and over $627 million overseas. Its total worldwide box-office take is over $1 billion and climbing. It is presently the 11th highest grossing film of all time. This is an astonishing feat and there is no end in sight.'The Avengers' opens with the global threat posed by the rotten scoundrel Loki (Tom Hiddleston), a god-like being from the distant Ansgard at the other side of the universe. Loki plans to unleash his warmongering monster minions to storm planet Earth and enslave the human race. Loki seeks to use the tesseract, which is essentially a weapon of mass destruction of insurmountable power, to aid in his quest for global dominance.S.H.I.E.L.D. Special Agent Nick Fury is not down with this. Neither is Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a.k.a. Iron-Man, the brilliant billionaire philanthropist in a high-tech super-suit of epic proportions; Natasha Romanoff/'The Black Widow' (Scarlett Johansson), an unparalleled martial arts expert; Steve Rogers/'Captain America' (Chris Evans), a genetically engineered super-soldier; Clint Barton/'Hawkeye' (Jeremy Renner) a hand-to-hand combat master; Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the god-like being, who is Loki's brother; and the elusive Dr. Bruce Banner/'The Incredible Hulk' (Mark Ruffalo), a scientist with a powerful alter-ego of, well, 'incredible' size, strength and endurance.There are several characters in this movie who demand their own signature moments of screen-time and individual back-stories (which were primarily covered in the other Marvel pictures). All these elements must tie into the crisis at hand with a neat little bow on top of it all. Also vying for screen-time is the flying fortress of S.H.I.E.L.D., an elaborate flying aircraft carrier. I've never seen anything quite like it before in the movies. Points awarded for originality and making me go 'hmm' as I watched our heroes venture into action on that aerial 'marvel.' Fans will probably gobble 'The Avengers' up with repeat viewings, strong word of mouth and what will likely be high volume DVD and Blu-ray sales. For them, the movie showcases in spades these superheroes uniting together in the same superhero film. Each superhero looks great and they certainly deliver the goods in terms of characterizations, use of super-powers and super-strength as they battle dark forces side-by-side.'The Avengers' is a very busy film. This film really is a superhero smorgasbord. It's ambitious in its approach as a piece of pop culture cinema. How the film manages to balance all of its multiple components is a strong suit. A movie like this could have felt like an enormous hodgepodge collage. To the film's credit, all the pieces fit together rather nicely. Sure, there are some loose ends that go in different directions. That's okay. The pendulums are set in motion for other story arcs in subsequent movies to follow. 'The Avengers' accomplishes this without becoming an incoherent mess. If filmgoers haven't seen the other films, and if they don't plan to see an Avengers' spin-off to see what else happens, that is fine. This picture is relatively self-contained. How many other films of this magnitude can pull that off? While I enjoyed it, I did feel this movie could not be more than what it is. From my perspective, it meets only the checkpoints. Here's what I mean: Do we see our Marvel heroes together? Yes. Do they bicker and fight each other at first? Yes. Do they overcome their sub-cultural differences to work in tandem against the Loki/WMD/alien invasion threat? Yes. Are there a few good jokes and a Stan Lee (the founder of Marvel Comics and co-creator of many of its characters) cameo thrown in for good measure? Well, funny you should ask . . .This film adaption of 'The Avengers' was directed by Joss Whedon, who is well-known in fantasy-television circles as the driving force behind 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' (1997-2003), 'Angel' (1999-2004), 'Firefly' (2002) and 'Dollhouse' (2009-2010). Given his track record and reverence for the fantasy genre, he was a natural choice to head this film. Why he had not broken into big-screen comic book film adaptions earlier is hard to say. Though, a few years back, he did try to bring DC Comics' 'Wonder Woman' to the screen in a failed attempt. He is clearly a story-teller who knows how to get his audience dialed-in and he gives them exactly what they want.Though likable, I personally found 'The Avengers' merely satisfying and nothing more. I know there are people who absolutely loved this film, while I only liked it at arms length. Perhaps that's due to my own tastes and sensibilities. Again, I felt this film only met checkpoints and it didn't do anything to exceed that. That's okay. This film will still be treasured by its fans, and I still managed to have fun with it too.",7,2,8,16 May 2012
Men in Black 3," Back in Black Times Three
","'Men in Black 3', Rated 'PG-13' for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Some Sexual Content, Violence, Mild Gore. Running Time: 1hr&46mns.My Take *** (Out of ****) -or- On the IMDb Scale: 7/10 After 16 years, we are still experiencing a particular Hollywood trend. I will call it 'The Big-Budget Will Smith Fantasy-Summer-Movie.' Sorry for coming up with such a long name for this trend, but it sure seems to ring true, doesn't it? Since 1996's 'Independence Day', there have been many summers like what I just described. Back then, I did not realize Will Smith would have that kind of staying power. Here we are 15 years after the original 'Men in Black' film hit multiplexes and Will Smith is still going strong.The 'Men in Black' film series is loosely based on an early '90s comic book series about a secret government organization which monitors supernatural phenomena, alien activities and safeguards against alien threats. These premises must have been in vogue in the early '90s, as at the same time there was a television series similar in structure that had the tagline 'Trust No One' (that show also had a 'foxy' redhead for additional sex appeal). For the 'Men in Black' films, the supernatural angle has been dropped in favor of staying focused on alien matters only.'Men in Black 3' (with a standard numeral in the title unlike the second movie that featured a Roman numeral 'II') is an unlikely sequel. The other two 'MiB' movies were self-contained adventures and the interest of a third installment really wasn't in demand. The good news is 'Men in Black 3' is actually a decent continuation.The movie opens with the escape of the intergalactic criminal Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement, 'Dinner for Schmucks') from his 40-year incarceration in the Lunar-Max Penitentiary. He is one volatile, mean and ugly hombre. He is also the last survivor of his conquering race of Boglodites that destroy worlds. He was put on ice in 1969 by Special Agent 'K' (Tommy Lee Jones, 'Captain America') at Cape Canaveral during the Apollo 11 launch. In the pursuit, Boris lost his left arm and swore revenge on Agent K at all costs.The plan Boris has is a fairly simple one: he will go back in time to the events that lead to his apprehension and kill Agent K. To do so would have a catastrophic effect on the future. In the original timeline, Agent K is also responsible for placing a special global shield on the tip of the Apollo 11 module that was activated in orbit to protect Earth from the imminent invasion of the Boglodites. Without Agent K to put the shield in place the world is in one heck of a predicament.Boris the Animal has a run-in with Agent K and his partner Agent J (Will Smith, 'I am Legend') before time-traveling to the past. His parting words to K are 'You are already dead. You just don't know it yet.' How prophetic, as the timeline is changed the moment Boris goes back. The only person unaffected by the changes is Agent J. He is aware of the timeline changes. He did not change with it because he is believed to have been present at the events in 1969. Therefore, we have a time paradox, and it is now necessary for Agent J to venture to the past.'Men in Black 3' has fun with time-travel on several fronts, the best one involving meeting the younger Special Agent K in 1969. He's played by Josh Brolin ('True Grit') who was made to look like actor Tommy Lee Jones. That's easy enough to do with a little make-up and combing his hair a certain way. Brolin stands out in the role by his posture, mannerisms and speech patterns. He is so uncannily like Tommy Lee Jones in his performance. Allegedly the film's director Barry Sonnenfeld (who directed all the movies in this series) shed tears of relief during Brolin's audition. Having Brolin cast is better than any of the over-the-top special effects that could have made Tommy Lee Jones look younger.An interesting addition to this picture is the alien Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg, 'Hugo'). He is one of the most likable and engaging characters I've seen in years in the movies. Griffin, like Boris, is the last of his race and living on Earth. He dresses like the video camera kid from 'American Beauty' (1999) and the youngsters from 'South Park' (1999). He is able to envision the futures of various possible outcomes which he sees in his mind. He is humble and wise as he delights in the simple things, like the outcome of a baseball game that hasn't happened yet. How he aids Agents K & J in their mission is one of the movie's charms.Like its predecessors, 'Men in Black 3' is special effects laden, mostly involving the various alien races that reside on Earth in hiding. They are creative in appearance and at times surprising in their individual functions. Take Boris the Animal for instance. He is symbiotic with parasitic creatures that live in his palm. Too weird. In keeping with the other films, this one is heavy with goo. Whether it is an alien being splattered or simply goo oozing out of them, the 'MiB' movies love their goo. I'm not sure why these movies adhere to this prerequisite. No doubt there is some marketing 'goo'-ru behind this.'Men in Black 3' is a fun popcorn movie. It is light and easy to get into. 'The Big-Budget Will Smith Fantasy-Summer-Movie' for 2012 is a gooey good time. By the film's closure there is new light shed on the K and J dynamic. It's unexpected and touching. A third movie in a series seldom has originality and heart. This one does.",7,2,4,6 June 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Dawn of the Living Tweens!
","'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1', Rated 'PG-13' for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Sexual Content, Partial Nudity, Some Gore and Mild Violence. Running Time: 1hr&57mn - Two & 1/2 Stars (out of Four).'Team Edward' is upon us once again. This fourth installment, 'Breaking Dawn Part 1,' is the beginning of the end for 'The Twilight Saga' film series. Next year's counterpart will close out the teen-vampire love story based on the popular books by Stephenie Meyer.The series centers around high school girl Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) who falls in love with Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a 108 year old vampire teen. He lives with his own vampire family, which doesn't prey on humans. They're the good guys. Naturally, any human-vampire romance isn't without complications, especially if you're an angsty teen. There's Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), who is part of clan of shape-shifting werewolves: sworn enemies to vampires with extreme prejudice against the Cullens. Complicating matters is Jacob's love for Bella and his intense hatred of Edward. What girl wouldn't want a love triangle between herself, a walking undead teen who sparkles in the sunlight and an uppity canine shapeshifter who spends much of his time sulking around shirtless? 'Breaking Dawn Part 1' opens with the marriage of Bella and Edward. Jacob is heartbroken and upset. He's deeply concerned for Bella's safety in both a physical sense (as a wedding night with a vampire could be dangerous) and for her eternal soul, should she become a vampire which would be inevitable in this kind of union.Bella and Edward's Rio de Janeiro honeymoon is probably everything a teen girl's fantasy could be: luxurious location, a secluded tropical getaway and a beautiful full moon over the ocean as our young lovers finally consummate their relationship. I really admired the photography of the South American country and the attention to art direction for this part of the movie. It's a nice representation of complete wish-fulfillment in a 'happily ever after' kind of way.Then things take a turn. Against all odds, Bella is now pregnant with a human-vampire hybrid. In a daring move, she decides to keep the baby and refuses to consider the adverse effects on her health and life. What's interesting to note in 'Breaking Dawn Part 1' is the fact Bella is carrying a baby whose very existence is the crux of the story. Sure, Bella's life is at great risk, but it's about the consequences of having the baby or not. I'm reminded of movies like 'Alien' where an unknown creature gestates inside a human host and bursts through their chest upon coming to term. Another scene that has potential horror flick connotations is when a local Rio de Janeiro demon expert puts her hands on Bella's tum-tum to determine the length of the pregnancy. At that moment, I'm channeling John Carpenter's 'The Thing' (1982) where the guy defibrillating the other guy has his hands bitten off at the wrists by 'The Thing' when the other guy's ribcage opens.Those horror movie clichés are inconceivable in the Twilight world. As far as everyone is concerned, it's only a matter of whether Bella's going to have this baby or not. That's the big dilemma: not only for the Cullens, but also for Jacob's werewolf clan which is hell-bent for war over the whole affair. Why they even care, I'm not quite sure. Something about protecting humans and abominations coming to life, I gather. What I've never understood about these movies is why everyone makes a big deal out of everything. Bella's decided to have the baby. She's in dire straits with a complicated pregnancy while everyone fights and yells around her over it. But hey, that's the Twilight universe for you. Everyone has to get huffy and puffy over matters which others would handle with more maturity. Can someone explain to me how Edward, who's more than 100 years old, has the cognitive reasoning of an adolescent with his knee-jerk reaction to Bella's pregnancy? So much for marital support.Interesting to note: the film, where Bella carries a child of great significance like a vampirical Virgin Mary, is drawing heat for her wanting to keep her baby. Natalie Wilson of the 'Ms.' magazine blog criticized the film for a 'latent anti-abortion message.' Sandie Angulo Chen of 'Moviefone' saw the film as 'one long pro-life debate. In contrast, John Mulderig of the 'Catholic News Service' praised the 'strongly pro-life message being conveyed via Bella's unusual plight,' saying it 'presents a welcome counterpoint to the all-too-frequent motif in popular entertainment whereby pregnancy is presented as a form of disease or an almost unbearable curse.'Well, think what you will of 'Breaking Dawn Part 1.' I know I did, though I'm not the film's intended audience. I appreciated the film's craft, yet, like its predecessors, the dialog is utterly hokey and the character interaction is preposterous. I guess these observations are things best left alone here. The 'Team Edward' and 'Team Jacob' minions would not have it any other way. I'm sure this film will be heralded by their legions. That's fine. It's their call to make. I have mine too: Netflix and 'Team Sookie!' ('True Blood').",6,3,7,29 December 2011
The Hunger Games," Game On
","'The Hunger Games', Rated 'PG-13' for Adult Situations, Mild Language, Some Graphic Violence. Running Time: 2hrs.&22mns.My Take *** (Out of ****) It's been about four months since I last reviewed a film about a dystopian future. Stories like this are great at making social commentaries about a caste society's impact on people. During the McCarthyism of the 1950s, Ray Bradbury and other science fiction writers used the conventions of these dystopian worlds to discuss ideas and morale tales with their readers. The format was a way to discuss war, sex, politics and religion by dressing these stories up in such a way that they would be passed off as 'fantasy' or 'make-believe' to get around the era's intolerances for points of view that were considered inappropriate or even un-American. Today it is easier to openly discuss these grand themes people without fear of prosecution. People are hungry for these kinds of stories and I suspect they will never be out of vogue.Proving my point, 'The Hunger Games' currently has the third highest grossing opening weekend at the U.S. box office (following 'The Dark Knight' [2008] and 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part II' [2011]).Based on the young adult novel of the same name, 'The Hunger Games' takes place in a future that is far beyond its post-apocalyptical origins. Where the North American countries once were is now the nation of Panem with a grandiose capital and elite ruling class. Far beyond the city limits are 12 impoverished districts.To keep the districts in check, the ruling class has devised 'The Hunger Games.' They serve as both a harsh reminder of the previous world, before the 'ages ago' post-nuclear horror, and to quell any potential uprising against the elitist government. Through a lottery, each of the 12 districts must offer both a boy and girl between ages 12 and 18 as 'tributes' to fight each other to the death in a woodland arena until only one child.This being a form of reality entertainment, tributes require sponsorship endorsements much like NASCAR drivers do. The financial and popular support from the viewership helps to foster an interest in the perils of our youthful gamers. Anything for 'must-see TV,' I guess. These gladiatorial games are televised live to the world with cameras hidden throughout the arena to capture every single movement from every single participant. Safeguards and arsenals are in place to keep the 'tributes' on task and prevent their escape.Skilled archer and hunter Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, 'X-Men: First Class') is very protective of her younger sister Primrose (Willow Shields, 'R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour'). So much in fact, Katniss becomes is the first volunteer to enter into The Hunger Games in lieu of her sister's defining lottery drawing. Also from District 12 is the dopey-eyed Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, 'Journey 2: The Lost Island'). The two kids are acquainted with each other, yet Peeta has underlying feelings for Katniss. How will this impact the outcome of this year's Hunger Game? President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland) leads Panem mercilessly, though he projects a public image of calmness and congeniality. He is not too thrilled about how the Head Gamemaker Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley, 'Underworld: Awakening') is handling the affection between Katniss and Peeta in front of global viewers. After all, there is world to keep in line.Suzanne Collins wrote the original novel. She was reportedly inspired to write the book by flipping through television channels. She noted a reality show on one channel and a military invasion on another. With some Greek influence added, she was able to conjure a story about loss, heroism and also make a social statement on poverty, starvation, oppression and the devastating effects of war on people.The themes from Collins' book are present in the screen adaptation and are handled well. The culture of the goal-mining District 12 reminded me of Amish communities in terms of plain dress and simple living. It is interesting to note the book is published by Scholastic, which from my childhood were the books that you used to send away through a grade school book order. Funny to think Scholastic are now the ones behind a teen-aimed fable where young people carve out each other's entrails on live TV in return for riches. My, how times have changed.In spite of the positive reviews and strong box-office numbers, 'The Hunger Games' is drawing criticism on allegations of racism, sexism and unrealistic body image. I don't think the movie intends to be anything more than a commentary on social classes, such as wealth and poverty. These have been absolutes from the dawn of the world.Though it is a good film, 'The Hunger Games' feels a little incomplete. The set-up is good, but I know there is more to this story. The novel is followed by two sequels 'Catching Fire' and 'Mockingjay.' As of this writing, the second book will be made into a movie and released in late 2013 and I have no doubt a third movie will be made. I suspect when 'The Hunger Games' is viewed in the context with the other two stories it will be more rounded and complete.'The Hunger Games' is a satisfactory fable with solid performances and good action. It's refreshing to see a movie targeted at teen audiences that is witty and engaging. The 'Team Edward' film series springs to mind. After all, the themes of war, starvation and poverty are a stark contrast to 'Does my sparkly vampire boyfriend like me?' 'The Hunger Games' does things right and whetted my appetite for more. I'm sure the upcoming installments will be the payoff. So far, the trilogy is off to a decent start.",8,2,9,4 April 2012
Hugo," Hugo Boss
","'Hugo', Rated 'PG' for Adult Situations and Mild Thematic Elements. Running Time: 2hrs.&8mns.My Take ***1/2 (Out of ****) At the end of January 2012, the nominees for the 84th Annual Academy Awards were announced. Leading the pack with 11 nominations is Martin Scorsese's 'Hugo' (2011), a film that was met with universal critical acclaim. Unfortunately for the people behind 'Hugo' the movie's box office returns were disappointing. The film grossed just $90 million, which is far below the film's $150 million budget. Perhaps on Oscar night all will be forgiven and there will be a renewed interest in the picture (as of this writing the 84th Annual Academy Awards is two & 1/2 weeks away).On the surface, 'Hugo' appears to be a departure from what movie goers expect from director Martin Scorsese. Over the last 30 years he has made a reputation and a Hollywood career out of gritty hard edged crime dramas, many focusing on the mafia. Don't be deceived. Scorsese has been known to make lovely artistic dramas as well. Even now it's hard to think that the man who brought us the likes of 'GoodFellas' (1990) and 'The Departed' (2006) is also the same guy who brought us the 19th century period piece high society film 'The Age of Innocence' (1993) or 'Kundun' (1997), a film about the Dalai Lama.To watch 'Hugo,' it is apparent the movie was a passion project for Scorsese. He's a celebrated filmmaker and 'Hugo' is celebration of the movies. More importantly, it is about dreamers and the dreams they dream. Who better than Scorsese to bring this story to you? The movie opens in the winter of 1930s Paris. Young Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan living in the Gare Montparnasse train station. He was the ward of his uncle (Ray Winstone) after his father (Jude Law) passed away in a museum fire. Now the uncle has been missing for several months, leaving no one to wind the clocks in the great station, save for Hugo. He performs his duties daily without fail.Before Hugo's father passed away, the father and son had started restoring a dilapidated automaton, which is a mysterious mechanical man that supposedly writes a special message with a pen. Hugo is determined to bring the mechanical man back to life, if only to write Hugo a message which he believes will be from his late father.Everything is a challenge for Hugo. To make ends meet, Hugo steals food to survive and mechanical parts for his machine restoration. He is careful to not get caught by the train station watchman, the inspector Gustav (Sasha Baron Cohen) who is ever vigil and quite experienced in sending orphans into group homes. The most prominent figure Hugo encounters at the train station is the toy store owner Georges (Sir Ben Kingsley). Hugo regularly lifts items from his store until one day Georges finally catches him. In a heartbreaking turn of events, Hugo's dream of restoring the automaton comes to a bitter end.Hugo has been on his own for so long, he's not too sure how to take the prospect of making a new friend in Georges goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz). She has a lively imagination and a love of books. Hugo loves to hear about the stories she reads and he in turn shares with her one of his loves he used to enjoy with his late father: the cinema. The movies Hugo and his father loved best were the ones rich in imagination where the possibilities of the screen seemed boundless. In fact, one character in 'Hugo' describes the movies as a place where a person could see the dreams from their sleep on the screen.It is pleasant to watch Hugo and Isabelle talk about dreams as if they are an elixir of life. Leave it to true dreamers to see them as such. These are smart kids dealing with the circumstances in their lives on their own terms. You generally don't see kids in the movies with this much passion about what makes them tick.It has been suggested that 'Hugo' is Martin Scorsese's autobiography. He has been consistently a powerful filmmaker with precise clear vision. 'Hugo' talks about the human drive for visions and imagination. It asks viewers what inspires them and what encourages them to carry on with their daily lives.Sometimes people lose their dreams. When that happens, everything they've done previous to that can be lost. 'Hugo' also shows us this loss and what it is to reach redemption and become reinvested once again.'Hugo' easily boasts the best looking visuals used to re-create the past, giving everything a recognizable, yet unearthly quality. The best way to describe it is it looks gritty and feels like something out of a storybook at the same time. All the buildings, machinery, sets and costuming are created in top form.There are a lot of really brilliant metaphors in 'Hugo' that hint about ideas, hopes and dreams. I believe that more than one viewing of this picture can take people to different places with each viewing. That's an unusual thing to say about a family geared movie. But then, 'Hugo' isn't just any film. How many features do you know that challenge us to look at ourselves, no matter what our circumstances are and then invite us to keep on dreaming? 'Hugo' does just that. The film honors the wonder of the movies and encourages us to celebrate dreaming.",8,3,4,7 February 2012
Batman Begins," THIS IS IT! - This is the Batman movie we've been waiting for !!!
","'Batman Begins' Running Time 2hrs & 20min. Rated 'PG-13' for Adult Situations, Some Language, Intense Violence and bizarre/disturbing imageryMy Take : **** (out of ****)Think 'The Last Samurai' crossed with 'Blade Runner'. This is probably the darkest, most realistic approach to a comic book movie that I've ever seen. The film score owes several nods to Vangelis' score for 'Blade Runner'. The score isn't there to be melodic, but rather an atmospheric narrative to the picture. The script is very sharp. Christopher Nolan's direction is right on and the acting is top notch. The cinematography is well done (especially a sequence involving a character traveling in what's suppose to be the Hymalas) and keeps you involved.'Batman Begins' tells of the origins the popular character 'Batman', as published by DC Comics. Young Bruce Wayne has a life shattering event that sends him down a path of self discovery. From childhood into adulthood, he pursues to understand the criminal mind during a quest for justice. In time, he will ultimately strike terror into the hearts of wrongdoers, and help steer his dismal Gotham City back from the brink, through adopting a dark and focused persona: That of Batman!Christian Bale hits the mark as Bruce Wayne. Batman's just as intense (or maybe more so) in his mission as Brandon Lee was in 'The Crow'. Some of the cinematography reminded me of artist Alex Ross's painted Batman works.'Batman Begin' feels like a midnight cult movie designed to cater to the fans of the harder edged DC Comic graphic novels of the late eighties. Fear not, this movie is a great introduction of the Batman lore to casual movie-goers as well! Based on the overall tone of 'Batman Begins', by holding true to it's source material, I'm pleasantly surprised that Warner Brothers green-lit this picture. As of this writing, I understand that a sequel is in the works. I look forward to that next installment, tentatively a 2008 release titled 'The Dark Knight', with great anticipation . . .",10,3,4,28 February 2007
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Worthy Mission
","'Mission: Impossible: Ghost Protocol' Rated 'PG-13' for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Adult Scenes, Violence & Mild Gore. Running Time: 2hrs&13mn. Three Stars (Out of ****)This summer (as of this writing it is 2012) Tom Cruise will turn 50 years old. Seems unbelievable, doesn't it? Has it really been 29 years since he first made a name for himself by dancing around in his underwear singing along to Bob Seger? As a box office marquee headliner for nearly three decades, he shows no sign of slowing down at all. In fact, Cruise's latest movie would have you believe the man has discovered the fountain of youth. After all, he's rumored to have done a majority of his own stunts in his latest action picture including a brilliant sequence where he actually scales the world's tallest building in Dubai (albeit in multiple safety harnesses, digitally erased).'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol,' the fourth entry in the 'M:I' series, is an extraordinarily well-made high octane action picture. There is international intrigue, a sleek sexy J-Crew looking assassin, multi-layered political agendas, action, suspense and the fate of global dominance hanging in the balance. Tom Cruise reprises his role as Impossible Missions Force (IMF) super agent Ethan Hunt. His team is tracking the elusive Hendricks in the Kremlin archives, who is believed to have Russian nuclear launch-codes with ambitions to launch a missile strike against the U.S. With Hunt's team on the scene, a bomb destroys most of the Kremlin and Hunt's group is framed as the terrorist masterminds behind it. Formally, the U.S. government will hunt (pun?) them down to bring them to justice. Before this can happen, the President initiates 'Ghost Protocol,' the covert black operation of the IMF. Under the 'Ghost Protocol,' Ethan Hunt's team is cut off from all resources and the U.S. government has disavowed the entire IMF. Hunt has only his wit, team and allies to help him save the U.S. and subsequently the world from disaster. He is joined in his quest by the lovely, yet hard as nails Jane (Paula Patton, 'Precious') and his globe trotting I.T. expert Benji (Simon Pegg, 'Shawn of the Dead'). IMF analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner, 'The Hurt Locker') joins their quest after the head of IMF (Tom Wilkinson, 'Batman Begins') is assassinated. 'Ghost Protocol' boasts two of the most memorable action sequences in multiplex cinema in recent years. The first remarkable action sequence is by itself the crown jewel of the entire 'Mission: Impossible' film franchise in terms of conception and presentation. I understand this sequence is presented in the 1:44 aspect ratio during the IMAX showings. No doubt in IMAX, this scene will trigger virtual vertigo in some audience members. The other sequence involves a futuristic-looking multi-level parking garage. My compliments on the originality of that scene. Finally, something audiences haven't seen before or, at the very least, haven't seen with this level (pun?) of sheen. This is an amazing live action feature film debut for director Brad Bird. He is best known as the director of animated fare like 'The Iron Giant' (1999), 'The Incredibles' (2004) and 'Ratatouille' (2007). All of those animated movies are planned and storyboarded to perfection before being set to film. It is apparent Bird's initial concept planning of 'Ghost Protocol' was conducted in a similar fashion to his animated works. No doubt every action scene was storyboarded with exceptional care and on the big screen it clearly shows. Interestingly, the 'Mission: Impossible' film series has had an quite an array of film directors: Brian De Palma ('The Untouchables' 1987), John Woo ('Face Off' 1997), J.J. Abrams ('Star Trek' 2009) and now Brad Bird. Each director has painted their distinctive style on their individual film canvasses. All four films are a little different: the first movie was suspense driven, the second was over-the-top action, the third a crowd pleaser and the latest venture is a live-action cartoon crossed with James Bond.Though I recommend this picture, I feel it necessary to point something out. This movie is very high gloss on craftsmanship, style and execution. However, like its predecessors, it is deficient in the character department. It is also a little dry. Not by much, but enough to notice. Maybe that doesn't matter. The 'Mission: Impossible' series exists to entertain us in the here and now. You may enjoy these films while watching them, but once they're over you tend to forget about them. Ethan Hunt does not stick with you the same way Jason Bourne, John McClane or Indiana Jones do. Yet the 'M:I' films are fun movies to watch 'in the moment.' That is where they reign best. Tom Cruise and Paramount Pictures seem pleased with the current box-office returns on 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.' A fifth film in the series is currently planned. Though for Cruise to continue his role in future 'M:I' entries is in question. The introduction of Renner's Brandt character is part of a deliberate failsafe plan from the studio behind the picture: should Cruise opt out of future 'M:I' films, Brandt would become the central protagonist to carry the torch of this series. However, that would really surprise me. Tom Cruise is currently in the early talks to appear in the proposed 'Top Gun II.' I'm sure that film won't be light on action. Also, he hasn't shown me any signs of slowing down yet. I think he has a few more years in action pictures. Time will tell.Speculation aside, 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol' is a great example of how a meticulously well-thought-out thriller should be. The style, pacing and elaborate action sequences are expertly pieced together. It's easily the best film in this series to date. Just sit back, let the movie do its thing and enjoy it 'in the now.'",8,3,7,4 January 2012
Puss in Boots," Meow!!! Booty Call! :)
","'Puss in Boots' (2011), Rated 'PG' for Some Mild Innuendo and Mild Violence. Running Time: 1hr&30min. Three Stars (out of Four)'Puss in Boots' is an animated delight chronicling the adventures of Puss in Boots before his encounter with Shrek in 'Shrek 2' (2004). This particular 'yarn' is the background story on how Puss came to don his hat, saber, boots and his status as a crusading outlaw with a heart of gold. Actor Antonio Banderas reprises his popular role as the voice of Puss. This time, director Chris Miller tones down the adult overtones and risqué humor present in the 'Shrek' pictures. 'Puss in Boots' is more of a straightforward family adventure. It is also somewhat less of a comedy than the 'Shrek' films, relying more on the story and great visuals. I suspect a few edits to this PG rated fare would bring it into the G rated realm. This highly colorful tale (or 'tail') opens with Puss escaping the certain doom of a night's mischievousness. He's on a quest to find magic beans he has been looking for since kittenhood, which in turn will lead him to a great kingdom in the clouds ripe for plunder. This leads him to an amusing confrontation with the deviant Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) who have the beans in their possession, and a new rival known as Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) who has an agenda all her own. It's not long before we meet Humpy Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) and learn of the bitter childhood connection between Humpy Dumpty and Puss in Boots. At their last encounter many years ago, an altercation stemmed in one 'having had a great fall' (as you may have heard) and the banishment of Puss from the town of El Ricardo, resulting in the subsequent origin of a wrongfully-accused swashbuckling champion of good although his paws might be 'a little sticky' from time-to-time. Puss always felt ashamed that his mother Imelda (Constance Marie) believed him to have turned to a life of crime and now seeks to redeem himself. Meanwhile Humpty Dumpty, who was once Puss's brother, continued to descend into a life of greed and develop a deep anger towards Puss in Boots.Puss, Humpty and Kitty Softpaws forge an uneasy alliance and they are off on a mission of financial gain and to restore Puss's El Ricardo community standing and his mother's faith in him. Along the journey, the audience is treated to grand visuals that are extremely vivid with details and color. Truly, this is a fanciful (or maybe a 'Fancy Feast'!) delight for the eyes. The visual points of interest include the pilgrimage through a desert, the climb (if it can be called as such) up a magical beanstalk, the sky kingdom and its garden with golden eggs. 'Puss in Boots' has fun with the characters, always keeping the atmosphere cheerful. A prime example of this is the dance-off between Puss and Kitty at the feline-only dance-club named 'The (G)litter Box' (where the G in the neon lettering is always on the fritz) complete with a musical number that is fresh, upbeat and engaging with a multitude of interesting visual gags ensuing in the background. This sequence is custom designed to keep viewers dialed-in and smiling.The 'Puss in Boots' story presented here is entirely its own creation. It bears no real ties to the original seventeenth century 'Puss in Boots' fairy tale by Charles Perrault. The only commonality between the two is the name, physical characteristics and personality of Puss. Beyond that, the film studio behind this picture, DreamWorks SKG, took extensive creative liberties with the material and decided to have fun with not one, but multiple fairy tales and assorted fairy tale characters to create a fresh movie for today's audiences for mass consumption. It works.Though not as original the first two 'Shrek' pictures, which pioneered the way for this movie and a multitude of other 'sophisticated' animated fare that has dominated multiplexes the last decade, 'Puss in Boots' delivers the goods. It's a fun, light-hearted time at the movies. Nothing more and nothing less.",7,1,1,29 December 2011
In Time," Racing the Clock
","'In Time' (2011), Rated 'PG-13' for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Brief Partial Nudity, Violence & Mild Gore. Running Time: 1hr&49mn - Three Stars (out of Four) As I watched 'In Time,' I was reminded of Ray Bradbury stories of yesteryear, the kind you were assigned to read in junior high and/or high school. All those sci-fi 'moral of the story' tales were similar in theme: an outlandish premise about a dystopian future which is really a social commentary on caste cultures and the human condition. This latest Justin Timberlake vehicle succeeds in taking those ingredients and borrowing contemporary social dilemmas straight from headlines to tell its story.The film opens in the year 2161, where the human aging process has been stopped at age 25 for everyone. Each person has a glowing digital 'lifeclock' visible in their left forearm tracking the time they have left before 'timing out' to death. Time is distributed via tactile contact from person to person and from time boxes. Starting at age 25, people automatically have their clocks are turned on with only one year to live. For a price you are able to live indefinitely. The well-to-do don't give this a second (pun) thought, as their wealth enables them to live years and centuries. They can even accrue and grow more time. The impoverished must work as drones in factories to earn minutes and days to add to their lifeclocks. The urgency of earning more time to maintain your life is crucial. As one character puts it best: 'You generally don't sleep in.' This makes for an attractive-looking society. People over the age of 100 are indistinguishable from people in their mid-twenties. Based on what I saw on the silver screen, I suspect the physical appearance of humans has been altered too. After all, everyone's mother and daughter all look like supermodels straight out of Victoria's Secret while the men all look like they should be on the cover of GQ Magazine.Will Salas (Timberlake) is a working class joe who lives with his mother (Olivia Wilde) in the ghettos of Dayton. A personal tragedy sets Will's crusade in motion to bring down the system to change the status quo for all those in the lower class 'time zones.' Will's cause is further aided when he is inadvertently helped by a suicidal wealthy benefactor, who transfers over 100 years of life to Will before timing out.Time is the only currency in their world. With it, people can buy whatever they can afford in days, weeks and years. Whether it is a hotel suite or high performance automobile, they pay with time. Will's newfound fortune raises the suspicions of Timekeeper Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy, 'Inception') who believes Will is a thief and murderer.Will escapes from his ghetto time zone to the wealthy time zone of New Greenwich in pursuit of a wealthy businessman (Vincent Kartheiser, TV's 'Mad Men') who built his fortune by holding the keys to immortality. After romancing his daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried, 'Big Love') and eventually kidnapping her, Will returns to the ghetto to show Sylvia the plight of those less fortunate than her. Soon, Will and Sylvia are robbing timebanks and sharing hundreds of years with the working-class all while being pursued by Timekeepers with decade-long bounties on each of their heads.'In Time' isn't astonishing or great cinema, but it is a fun sci-fi popcorn thriller. The present day messages about social inequity ring true. In reality we have people in various social classes, in some cultures even castes, around the world struggling to make ends meet on a daily basis. These themes are as old as time. Does the movie clamor on the edge in the political arenas debating the redistribution of wealth? Is it designed to generate awareness of global poverty? I'll leave that for the viewer to discern.Originally, the release for 'In Time' was nearly blocked by sci-fi author Harlan Ellison who alleged it was stolen from one of his short stories. Upon seeing this film, Ellison backed off, though he did receive a screen credit for 'The Terminator' (1984) when he made a similar claim on that film. Like I said, 'In Time' felt like those grade school dystopian fables we grew up with, so maybe there is no reinventing the wheel on how to dress up a message and make social statement. I'm sure Ellison or Bradbury were not the first writers to do so. Look at Shakespeare, he did it before those guys. Going further back, how about that story about Oedipus? Shocking what Sigmund Freud said what that was really about! 'In Time' is a nice evening at the movies. Not amazing, but pleasant and likable enough to carry you through to its conclusion. There's some convincing acting, good action and it also works as a chase movie too. The film makes some relevant observations and is highly timely (pun). You can never have too many films that entertain you and make you think a little bit in the process. 'In Time' does those things well.",7,0,0,29 December 2011
Dark Shadows," Barnabas BEGINS
","'Dark Shadows', Rated 'PG-13' for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Adult Humor, Some Sexual Innuendo, Violence and Mild Gore. Running Time: 1hr&53mns.My Take **1/2 (out of ****) -&/or- The IMDb Scale: 6.4/10 I never understood the appeal daytime soap operas. Though, I must confess, I've always been curious about 'Dark Shadows,' the daytime soap that ran from 1967-1971. I've always been aware of it, but never saw it. This show was set in a dark Maine mansion where family patriarch Barnabas Collins was a 200-year-old vampire. Supernatural occurrences were normal for the series. So were supernatural beings like werewolves, witches, warlocks, zombies and ghosts. They sure didn't have those on 'As the World Turns.' 'Dark Shadows' was never a mainstream mainstay, though it did gain a cult-like fan following. Now 'Dark Shadows' has been re-imagined for a big-screen makeover by director Tim Burton ('Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' 'Sweeney Todd') and actor Johnny Depp, who are also fans of the series. Depp even claimed when he was a teenager he wanted to be Barnabas Collins. In Burton's new 'Dark Shadows' movie, Depp gets to do exactly that.The film opens in 1760 with the entrepreneurial Collins family leaving Liverpool, England for Maine to further their fishing business empire. The family settles the bustling Collinsport and they build the elaborate family mansion of Collinswood Manor. Growing up in the lap of luxury, Barnabas Collins (Depp, 'Pirates of the Caribbean') enjoyed his youth as a wealthy playboy destined to take over the family business. That is until he spurned the love of jealous witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green, 'Casino Royale') for his fiancée Josette DePres (Bella Heathcote, 'In Time'). Angelique uses her dark arts to kill Josette and turn Barnabas into a vampire to mourn Josette for eternity. Framed by the dubious witch, Barnabas is chained and buried alive by the townspeople of Collinsport.After 200 years of confinement, Barnabas is freed in 1972. His discovery of a certain fast food chain's sign provides one of the biggest laughs in the whole movie. He finds his beloved Collinswood to be a shadow of its former self with only four living Collins residing there. The family is no longer a proud one, but dysfunctional and unhappy. The curse Angelique had put on Barnabas also affected the future generations of the Collins with travesty and despair.Angelique is still in Collinsport after two centuries. Through her black magic, she has not aged a day. She has made it her life's work to sink the Collins family into financial ruin with her own fishing businesses. Once she discovers Barnabas is back, she resumes her fascination with him and plots to have him at all costs.As I watched 'Dark Shadows,' I deeply admired the craft of the movie. Here is a film that doesn't go over the top with CGI to tell its story. CGI is there, but the film relies more on tone, darkness, shadows and the elaborate sets of Collinswood Manor to create a convincing atmosphere for the characters to exist in. I enjoyed the old-fashioned feel to the picture, befitting to the eras we see depicted, which is something many big-budget special effects extravaganzas seem to get wrong.Johnny Depp is fun to watch as Barnabas Collins. I really enjoyed his appropriately stilted performance as a late 1700s British man muddling his way through 1970s American culture. His observations of music icons Karen Carpenter, Alice Cooper and Steve Miller definitely provide nice touches of humor. Barnabas is a fish out of water. His interactions with other characters are high points throughout the film. Kudos is also in order for Eva Green. She's very classy and sassy as Angelique. She's a great foil to the Collins family.Though 'Dark Shadows' is replete with vampirism, witchcraft, secret identities, re-incarnation, ghostly apparitions and a brooding mansion with secrets, I couldn't help but feel the movie felt a little flat. You would think the film with all these elements would have enormous entertainment potential. In fact, the whole second act is one big lull. As it stands, 'Dark Shadows' is like an ice-cold sodapop without the fizz.I'm not sure if Tim Burton really knew where he was going with this movie. Is this film best served as a comedy? Well, maybe if there were more humor to balance out the story and tone. Is it a drama? For a picture inspired by a soap opera, the normal plot-twists and surprises you would expect to see are absent. Is it a horror film? Not really, but it does borrow overtones from the spooky Republic/Hammer films of yesteryear.'Dark Shadows' is not a bad film by any means. I kind of liked it, but not enough to recommend it (a bare minimum of three stars are required for that). The film suffers from being a 'one-shot.' It has all these really great parts to it, but due to time restraints, nothing is really explored beyond the basics. It is like the filmmakers put everything into this picture because they wanted it to be representative of the television series. The problem there is the TV show had time to go into these different tangents over a course of several episodes. The movie does not have the ability to do that.'Dark Shadows' looks good with great looking sets and spot-on acting. The soundtrack is a great montage of rock songs popular in the early seventies. If anything you can at least enjoy the ambiance the visuals, acting and music provide throughout this picture. The picture is only hindered by a sense of aimlessness. So, Mr. Tim Burton, if you're not sure what kind of a film you're trying to make, then your audience might not know what to make of your film either. I'm just sayin'.",6,0,2,22 May 2012
Prometheus," Who or What is Out There?
","'Prometheus', Rated 'R' for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Adult Scenes, Some Sexual Content & Graphic Violence. Running Time: 2hr&04mns.My Take *** (out of ****) -or- 7/10 on the IMDb Scale Shortly after a I completed Navy basic training, I went on a camping trip in the Wisconsin north woods with my friend John. After we watched a lunar eclipse, John told me about 'the greys' and several other alien races that watch planet Earth. He explained that alien hybrids walk among us (apparently one was really good friends with his mom). John was also very big on the notion the human race had been 'planted' on Earth by the alien race of 'the greys' who watch us from the dark side of the moon. Not that I bought into this theory, but I let him speak his piece.That night, I learned about panspermia, the hypothesis that life exists throughout the universe and it is deposited on planets by celestial objects and/or other beings. I thought of John while I watched 'Prometheus,' the latest Ridley Scott ('Blade Runner,' 'Gladiator') film. This film uses the premise of panspermia as the springboard for its story.This film is loosely (though not necessarily) set in the 'Alien' film continuity originated by Scott in 1979's 'Alien.' The 'Alien' films run the gamut of sci-fi horror flicks. The first was a 'bump-in-the-night' kind of movie. The other offerings were creepy action pictures. 'Prometheus' is the first time the series questions mankind's origins.This film opens in the side of a cliff high in Scotland where a group of researchers discover a cave with primitive paintings on its walls. The paintings are similar to other paintings found throughout time around the world. All of the paintings pre-date recorded history and each contain an identical star chart. Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce, 'Lockdown') the elderly CEO of the Weyland Corporation (a forerunner of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation as seen in the 'Alien' pictures) finances the interstellar craft 'Prometheus' to journey with a research team to the location depicted in the ancient graphs.In Greek mythology, the titan Prometheus created man from clay. Similiarly, the science vessel Prometheus is seeking a potential alien race which may be responsible for planting mankind in primordial DNA form at the dawn of time on Earth. The scientific aspect of the mission is overseen by the Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace, 'Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows'). Though she considers herself a Christian with strong faith, she is in search of answers to assert her faith. What will she think if she learns an alien race really did plant mankind? What will become of her faith? Asking these kinds of 'what if' questions is what 'Prometheus' does best.There are several characters on the expedition with different agendas. Some are looking for the answers to life while others are only on board Prometheus to 'drive the bus' and collect a paycheck.The mission director Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron, 'Snow White and the Huntsman') is a bitter ice-queen who has no interest in the mission. Being a consummate professional, she will ensure the mission is carried out to the fullest to give it the benefit of the doubt.Prometheus sets down on the foreboding world believed to be the location of 'the engineers' who may have made the human race. Shaw leads the investigation team into a pyramid structure to discover humanoid remains and biological residue. Is it alive? That's when we learn the explorers are not alone in there. Something lurks in the shadows and in the puddles. But what? Creepy android David (Michael Fassbender, 'X-Men: First Class') is also asking questions about existence. When he asks a crew member why man created androids, David is disappointed with the answer of 'Because we could.' David asks the crewman what he would think if the engineers would give mankind a similar answer. What then? The level of disappointment man would experience might be too much to bear.'Prometheus' is grand in concept, scope and vision. Director Ridley Scott approaches the film in a thought provoking manner. This film challenges people to discuss creation, intelligent design and panspermia. All this and it's a primarily a horror film. The scares are freaky. The sequence of a woman performing a self-abortion is both unsettling and claustrophobic. It echoes the original 'Alien' dining scene with the alien's first emergence. This new scene is expertly done and might be as memorable.Though 'Prometheus' deserves praise for its craft, I found the picture a little underwhelming as a whole. Sure, the vistas and scares are good, but I wonder if that's going to be enough satisfy audiences. Questions are left unanswered and new ones are asked. Though I realize the characters live in a dark world, I found the movie a little too grim, sterile and devoid of emotion for my tastes. This is to the picture's detriment. At least James Cameron's 'Aliens' (1986) provided top-notch scares with some comic relief in the form of Private Hudson ('Game over, man! Game over!'). 'Prometheus' lays the dread on pretty thick and heavy without ever looking back.I marginally recommend 'Prometheus' for its sharp writing, grand visuals, scares and overall creepiness. What the crew ultimately encounters ends anti-climatically, though hints at a possible sequel. There are traces of the feel of 'Alien' thrown in for good measure, but it feels like homages to a much better picture. 'Prometheus' may disturb and entertain audiences, as it is designed to, but I doubt many people will ever care to see it again. That's too bad. This movie has all the makings to be one of the great ones. Instead, you get a film where you settle. Though a decent offering, there's nothing about it that sticks. Maybe it doesn't have to, but I was really hoping for something a little more.",7,0,4,19 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman ENDS = 'Escape from New York' times Ten . . .
","'The Dark Knight Rises', Rated 'PG-13' for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Mild Sexual Innuendo, Violence, Mild Gore. Running Time: 2hr&44mns.My Take *** (Out of ****) -- IMDb = 7.3/10Director Christopher Nolan's take on Batman has finally come to an end. Nolan's third and final 'bat-offering' completes his near-perfect film trilogy of the popular DC Comics character. To say that Nolan's take on the Batman, a character rich with over 73 years of history, is the definitive version of the caped-crusader is entirely subjective. The first two films in this series, 'Batman Begins' (2005) and 'The Dark Knight' (2008) raised the bar on comic-book film adaptations. Both films have been universally praised as the genre's two best movies. Based on that, will 'The Dark Knight Rises' live up to the film legacy established by its predecessors? Will it conclude the trilogy on a satisfactory note?What distinguishes the Nolan Batman films from other comic-book inspired movies is the naturalistic approach to the source material. His films provided fresh and interesting re-interpretations of well-known characters in terms of relatability and their social relevance. Straight out of today's headlines, 'The Dark Knight Rises' deals heavily with issues of social inequality, class warfare, identity theft, re-distribution of wealth, terrorism and righteous fanaticism. Eight years after 'The Dark Knight', the Batman (Christian Bale, 'The Fighter') has not been sighted since the fateful night he took the rap for the death of the Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Ackhart, 'Battleground: Los Angeles'). He is wanted by the police. His vigilantism will no longer be tolerated. Batman is really the secret identity of the billionaire philanthropist and playboy Bruce Wayne. He also has been absent from the public-eye, holed up in his restored ancestral home of Wayne Manor. His depression over the death of his beloved Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhahl, 'Hysteria'), from the previous picture, has left him in mental shambles. He is also in a deteriorated physical condition due to his dark defender days. Wayne's physician assures him he does not have any cartilage remaining in his knee. There is scar tissue on his kidneys and there is concussive damage to his brain tissue. He's not even match enough for the sleek cat-burglar Selena Kyle (Anne Hathaway, 'Love and Other Drugs') when she robs him, not once, but twice.Enter Bane (Tom Hardy, 'Inception'). He's an eco-terrorist with a seeming agenda to punish Gotham's wealthy. He initiates a steep toll on western civilization by attacking Gotham's financial and professional sports worlds with his insurmountable armies and resources. His attack on Gotham's social elite is eclipsed by a more sinister plot, one of proportions no city or the entire world has ever seen. Given the apocalyptical nature of plan, is fitting the hulking masked Bane resembles a nomad from 'The Road Warrior' (1981) with the most intense voice for a cinematic villain since Darth Vader.The urging of Police Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II') and rookie beat cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, '50/50') presses the dark knight back into service. Wayne Industries CEO Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman, 'A Dolphin Tale') is still a technological ally for Batman. Also offering aid is the environmentally conscious Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard, 'Contagion'). She just might have what it takes to save Wayne Enterprises from financial ruin. Not onboard with Batman's return is Wayne's faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine, 'Journey 2: The Mysterious Island'). He is a loving father figure who fears Bruce is on a path of self-destruction. There aren't many scenes between Alfred and Bruce, but the scenes they do have are touching and resonate with you after the film is over.2008's 'The Dark Knight' was a pitch-perfect movie (****/**** -- IMDb = 10/10). That film was bold in a way comic book movies had never previously been (eight months after TDK's release the 'Watchmen' also took the genre to new ground). In comparison 'TDK Rises', though it is satisfactory entertainment that delivers, comes up a little short both as a third part of a trilogy and as a stand-alone movie.This is a Batman movie that barely has Batman in it. With a running time just under three hours, Batman makes a few short appearances and then a longer one during the climax of the picture. For a flagship superhero movie, why is he barely in it? This new picture is unusually grim for big-budget superhero film about a such a mainstream comic book icon. Though it is a good feature, I cannot say it is much fun. This film is bleak and depressing. I felt all of the Batman series regulars (Batman, Gordon and Fox) were somewhat restrained from their usual positions of proactivity against adversity. I realize every situation and movie is different, yet it just felt a little off to me. When the Batman regulars do band together to oppose the terrorism threat, it feels a little too little too late. As a result, the movie's middle section seemed to sag. I think the middle part could have been consolidated or re-worked to fix the momentum, or its lack there of. Though the finale is grand, the resolution of all the main characters felt a little rushed and forced. This is a minor complaint, as I'm sure many people will love the ending and it will be talked about in the years to come. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is at its core a war-time disaster picture. It is an extremely tangible commentary on social inequalities and terrorism of this age. Though not perfect, Christopher Nolan delivers an extremely ambitious and very intense film. The movie's last third is 'Escape from New York' times ten (you'll see why). This film does ultimately accomplish what it set out to do: the Batman legend does end in style. Overall, it is a fitting conclusion to the dark knight saga.",7,1,2,27 July 2012
