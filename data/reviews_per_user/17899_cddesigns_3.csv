Blade Runner 2049," Captures the spirit of the original
","To make a continuation of a film 35 years after the release of the original, and be able to capture the atmosphere and feeling it imparted is a monumental task. However, Blade Runner 2049 achieves and excels at this.The audience becomes acquainted with K, a replicant officer who, in his routine job of eliminating old model replicants, stumbles upon a discovery of an evolution of sorts that these older replicants have achieved without the guidance of a human hand. This touches off a series of events that have K deeply questioning both the ethical issues in his line of work and the nature of his own existence.Ryan Gosling delivers perhaps his best performance to date, drawing the viewer into the emotions experienced by K without great exaggeration on his part. He reaches the audience with what is being said in his eyes; a description of what he's feeling is not needed, and neither is a wide assortment of facial expressions. His subtlety is poignantly imparted.The only area where I feel this film falls a bit short, is we don't seem to feel the same desperation the replicants have in the original Blade Runner. In 2049, replicants are the next best thing to human; in some ways, better. While still subject to discrimination in society, they aren't seen as the same kind of freaks as they are in Blade Runner. Not so much in hiding and more out among biological humans, they hold jobs from government to blue collar positions, and proliferate the underbelly as well as prostitutes. Their emotions are clear and natural. This is a contrast to Blade Runner, where we are shown that replicants can feel emotion, but are lacking in the ability to express and name what they are feeling. This quality is what gave us a deeper connection to the replicants and a desire to want to connect to their hearts. This is missing from 2049. We do feel some measure of pity still for them, but there is a depth that is missing.In the realm of audio and visuals, 2049 nails Blade Runner's feel with a pinpoint accuracy. Even though modern equipment gives clarity to visuals that wasn't possible in 1982, the production team realized this and managed to achieve the gritty, dirty feeling left with us in Blade Runner. Even behind the clinical walls of the laboratories and elite businesses, we can't escape the tinge of decay and filth from violence of times gone by. There are more than a few nods to specific visuals and sounds from Blade Runner that will not go unnoticed. The atmospheres succeed in the feelings they are meant to leave us with, especially the final fight scene. We don't get the tense but exciting chase scene that Blade Runner gave us, the one that still affords is a measure of comfort in our seats; 2049's final fight is highly uncomfortable and claustrophobic, made more intense if seen in 3D. As an aside, I feel this was the only scene the 3D really enhanced - the amount it helps with immersion in the rest of the film is minimal.Overall, a fan of Blade Runner will not feel let down by 2049. It is clear the cast and crew had a love for it that drove their dedication to creating not just a sequel, but a homage.",8,3,11,7 October 2017
The Shape of Water," A breath of fresh water
","Few filmmakers have the ability to present a story in a way that is unmistakably unique these days, in the swirling miasma of cookie-cutter movies that are exhaustingly predictable and rely heavily on pyrotechnics and CGI to make up for the lack of heart. But Guillermo del Toro fills The Shape of Water to the brim with a genuineness rarely seen.Set in 1960's Baltimore, this story is a bit Romeo and Juliet, a bit Beauty and the Beast, except in this instance the beast is the one that appears outwardly normal. A mute custodian with a case of curiosity killed the cat syndrome (Sally Hawkins) becomes entangled in a tug-of-war between American and Soviet government powers after she discovers a creature being held hostage by the facility she works at, and her endlessly kind heart won't allow herself to let them use it as their pawn. The villain of this story, Strickland (Michael Shannon), proves to be one of the most complex characters. He serves up no shortage of the aforementioned beastly qualities, projecting his frustrations of his failings as a man and subsequent own self-hatred on everyone around him in a variety of ways. Torture, intimidation, emotional manipulation, racism, verbal and physical abuse and sexual harrassment are all employed by him, even a lack of basic hygiene is displayed as he fails to wash his hands after urinating in the first scene the audience is properly introduced to him. Despite all this, del Toro and Shannon still manage to make it clear that while this character wields a considerable amount of power, we get quite clearly the feeling that he is also powerless - a sad, joyless man with a lack of connection to his family and a lack of any kind of fulfilling relationships in his life, grasping at threads of power in the hopes of catching one and somehow finding the innate sense of pride and worth he has always been searching for. People respond to him out of fear rather than out of respect. He is a puppet of the system, under the thumb of greater authority and he knows it. It fills him with a rage that he takes out on anyone who either earns - or doesn't earn - his ire.Elisa (Hawkins) shines with a genuinely heartfelt performance. Meek and often terrified of the brutality she sees around her, but also tough in her own way, the audience will find it difficult not to like her. Entirely without verbal dialogue, Hawkins is successful in portraying the kind spirit, gutsy strength and quirky personality of Elisa. Likewise, her screen partner The Asset (Doug Jones) delivers a very convincing portrayal of a creature that's not quite man and not quite animal. He moves in a unique way that is signature to Jones but yet has a quality (and statuesque figure) also reminiscent of the god that some of the film's characters wonder if he is. Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and Giles (Richard Jenkins) are the perfect kind of kindred spirits, with Giles being a realist and Zelda being motherly at the appropriate times that Elisa needs them to provide that for her. Like her, they share qualities that render them 'imperfect' in the society of the time; Zelda is a woman of colour, Giles is gay, and all of them have a greater than average sense of empathy.Particularly and curiously impressive is the way opposing elements in this film fit so perfectly together - drama, horror, comedy and even whimsy-filled musical routines all somehow work in harmony with each other in a way that feels very natural. The fairy-tale elements are balanced carefully with the more adult aspects of the story, so while there are certainly some tear-jerking and frightening moments, viewers still leave at the end with a feeling of magic and inspiration. Plausible and implausible scenes and elements work so well together that the audience can easily accept the story for what it is.The only real criticism to put forth is that the development of the relationship between Elisa and The Asset is patchy - we see snippets of their admiration for each other growing, but then it seems to take a leap between friendship and deeper intimacy that the audience feels a bit left out on. The film follows Strickland and Giles' characters more closely as far as interpersonal relationships go, something that the film could have used more of for greater development of Elisa's character and deeper understanding from the audience of how much she has really suffered. The character of The Asset is never truly developed either - however, this may be very intentional as del Toro stated in previous interviews that the creature represents something different to everyone. Perhaps it is up to the viewer to decide what he represents for them. In some ways, this renders the character an eternal victim - always being used for something by someone. For governments, a weapon; for Giles, an artistic muse; for Strickland, a punching bag to offload his anger onto; and for Elisa, a recipient for her love and intimate desires. Although the creature reciprocates her affections, we can't shake the fact that he never really initiates them, just follows suit, leading one to wonder what decisions he would make in that matter (or any) if he had the freedom to do so.With all its complex beauty and freshness, The Shape of Water is a must-see for those wishing to experience a film that's truly new, and to feel the true soul that comes forth in it.",9,72,138,23 December 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Needs more bird, less man
","As a fan of Michael Keaton almost my entire life, I do have to say this film did not let me down due to him. He has always been a great character actor, and Birdman proves that he's still got that. Overall, I enjoyed the film; Galifinakis was the perfect neurotic director, Norton was an impeccable asshole, the jarring, unconventional musical score and shaky camera perfectly mirrored the scattered chaotic personal and professional lives of the characters.Where I felt some disappointment was the woeful neglect of Riggan's Birdman psyche. I would have loved to see some backstory on how this character became so schizophrenically entrenched in the mind of Riggan. The audience could have used the break; after about an hour of endless theatre scenes, I was becoming a bit restless and thinking it would be nice if the plot took a detour. More exploration into Birdman would have also given a chance to showcase the much-hyped, incredible suit designed by the unmatched Spectral Motion. I think the full suit was seen on screen a total of twice during the course of the film.Overall, Birdman was a moderately funny, clever and avant-garde film that could have been even an outstanding one with even a little more exploration into the mysterious costumed hero of Riggan's past",7,1,9,16 November 2014
