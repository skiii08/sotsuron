Mission: Impossible III," I went in for a clich√©d action movie and was surprised
","Sure, it followed the normal action movie formula. But hey, that's what we go in expecting. But what was surprising was how well everything fit together from the pace to the plot to the characters. Usually an action movie lacks believable motivation, or in trying to be a clever action movie the pace becomes unbearably slow.Somehow MI III got it all right. It struck the right balance in suspense, action, revenge, and even comedy. Even details like the film location enhanced the movie. Nothing was done for pure show or Cruise's ego. Impressive...might be stretching it, but it's definitely one of the best action films I've seen in a long time.",10,2,4,4 May 2006
