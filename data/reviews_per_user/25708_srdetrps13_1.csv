Come and See," How a boy is turned into a man
","The 1985 war movie 'Come and See' portrays the cheerful innocence of a young boy, (Florya) who volunteers to fight for his home town, but is robbed of said innocence in the process of doing so.Rather than focusing on the well known historical events of the battles fought by the Red Army, this movie shows the battle in a small province known as Byelorussia (known currently as the Republic of Belarus) and their citizens who fought to protect it. Klimov accentuates the use of sound effects to further intensify the gruesome and shocking scenes shown in this film. Just like in 'Saving Private Ryan', Klimov allows us to hear the deafening ringing from the characters perspective when bombs are dropped. Also, the scene where Florya and Glasha return to Florya's village, flies can be heard buzzing around, which then shows a scene of a pile of corpses. Klimov also uses an eerie background sound in certain scenes which really sets the mood for this movie.Overall I thought this was a great movie. It had me feeling many different emotions, and left me wondering what happened to the protagonist after it was over. I definitely recommend it.",8,1,1,13 December 2011
