Alien 3," A film that still bothers me!!!
","Alien 3 is a sequel that has bothered me for years. I had the pleasure of recently voting it as one of the worst movies of the last 100 years. It really irritated me for the following reasons: (This review is a comment to those who have already seen the movie)I swear the writers of Alien 3 never saw the first two movies or at least forgot them. Where did the 'face hugger' come from in the shuttle?? It`s obvious in the first two movies that the 'face huggers' impregnate their victims and die but in Alien 3 it impregnates Ripley and the dog... Why did it seems to take a week for the Alien to explode from Ripley while in the first movie it took about an hour??? How did Ripley know she had a 'Queen' Alien in her????I also think the point of the first 2 movies was Ripley was  a survivor.We know she is going to die about 1/3 the way through the movie. This destroyed all the suspense!!!!!!I also think the Alien looked really fake!!!! The use of computer effects didn`t work...
