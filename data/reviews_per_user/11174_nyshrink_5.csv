Skyfall," Preposterous and Weird
","James Bond movies have never been 'realistic,' but in this installment Bond is invulnerable like a cartoon character. He's Wile E. Coyote; a one-ton weight could drop on him and he would just crawl out from under it. It's preposterous. There are a number of other ridiculosities that sadly are becoming standard for action movies, such as the outrunning of explosions, people shooting up cars yet somehow the driver is unhurt and the gas tank doesn't explode, etc. Suspension of disbelief is ruined within the first 10 minutes.In addition, there is a creepy plot line about a renegade agent who has a 'Psycho' type mother issue relating to 'M.' I have never seen anything like this in a Bond film and it is just weird. There's some awful dialogue, like they were writing the script as they were filming it. Naomie Harris, the interesting actress from '28 Days Later' is wasted. The movie is saved from being garbage by the enormous amount of money spent on action sequences in exotic locales, and fine acting by Javier Bardem, Judi Dench, Naomie Harris and Ralph Fiennes. I would add Daniel Craig but in this film he does little more than kill people. There are no romance scenes as in 'Casino Royale.' Bond comes across as cold and unappealing, not sexy and complicated as in the previous two films with Craig. The more I think about this film the less I like it.",5,10,22,9 November 2012
The Way Back," Epic Survival Tale
","This is a film for people who appreciate epic landscapes and survivor stories. It has some engaging characters but not brilliant dialogue or complicated characters. Mostly, it is a visual film, displaying the vulnerability of a few people in a harsh, vast, beautiful landscape. They must depend on each other, and they develop an intimacy based on their shared struggle rather than on deep conversations and emotional revelations, or at least, not until a young girl joins them. Weir seems to be commenting on the yin yang of masculinity/femininity at times in this film. I also liked the subtle underlying commentary on the brutal oppression of the Soviet regime under Stalin.All of the actors were good; Farrell adds a touch of humor, Sturgess portrays anguish well, and Harris is a good tough old guy--his usual persona. By the way, Manohla Dargis in The New York Times complains that Farrell is too good-looking to be a Russian gangster. What this assessment is based on I can't imagine; doubt Dargis hangs with Russian gangsters.",8,95,115,23 January 2011
Slumdog Millionaire," Best Movie So Far This Year
","Everyone should see this movie. Not only is it a very well done film and entertaining story, but it couldn't be more relevant.The film is the story of two Muslim boys living in the slums of Mumbai, who are orphaned by a pogrom against Muslims. (Unfortunately, such an event occurred in real life). They survive by their wits, and their wits are considerable. One ends up on a game show where he is poised to be a multi-million rupee winner. How did he end up there, and why is he getting all the answers right? The movie is the story that answers those questions. It is also an intense drama, and an expose of what India is really like. It's true the story is not realistic, in that there are too many coincidences. But the setting and the characters are realistic. The story does what it is meant to; it is meant to entertain and surprise you, and it does.",9,0,1,1 December 2008
In the Land of Blood and Honey," All's Fair in Love and War
","This is a well-made film. It's not merely a docudrama; it is suspenseful and the characters' drama is meaningful and engaging.I am puzzled by the criticism the movie is too violent. It only seems too violent if you have never seen the evening news or a documentary about war. In comparison, this movie is restrained in its depiction of violence.I'm also mystified by the charge some have made that the movie is biased. We all know these events occurred; there is no controversy. In fact the movie seems to go out of its way to give some history that makes the perpetrators' hatred less inexplicable. I learned some things about the history of the region that I hadn't known.Angelina Jolie has successfully made the transition to writer/director. The film is shot like an action movie in many scenes. Most of the film is gripping, but towards the end I started to feel like it was going on a tad too long. But then again, so did the war.I wasn't sure I liked the final scene. But I do think Jolie deserves praise for an ending that overall, was believable and made sense in light of everything that had occurred among the characters.",9,96,365,7 January 2012
The Great Gatsby," Fitzgerald Can't Be Ruined
","It's hard to give a numerical rating to this film, because Fitzgerald deserves a 10 and everything else about the film is almost irrelevant. The screenplay preserves much of the dialogue. I haven't read the book in decades, but I did read it twice, and it all came back to me while watching this film.The movie is not 'over-the-top' as some have claimed. The party scenes are extravagant, but they provide an effective contrast to the later scenes that are dark and scathing in their social criticism. The costumes were meticulous, beautiful and seemed period-authentic. I didn't like the hip-hop songs, but they were brief. Most of the music is supplied by the Bryan Ferry Orchestra.I have two complaints about the film: The painted backgrounds are a bit too obvious (as they are in most movies) and the acting was a bit of a letdown. DiCaprio is brilliant in some scenes and seems a bit confused in others. Maguire overdoes his facial expressions. Mulligan is convincing in her sad scenes, but it's hard to believe her as a woman who inspires desperate love. I couldn't understand why the Jewish gangster is portrayed by someone South Asian. In the end though, I didn't care about these quibbles.",8,1,2,28 May 2013
