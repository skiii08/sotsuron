Blade Runner 2049," The master of all but one
","I think the movie was very seamless, it showed us believably a world where fear dominated each decade with different incarnations. The apolitical fear of surveillance is put in front, where nefarious people can track K down wherever he went. That is something beautiful, and inevitable for such tech. The blade runner himself seemed to be believable, but I think the forced resistance towards the end made it dangerous close to becoming trapped in the Divergent generic pop. Ford's signature attention to detail could have been used in more than one scene with the blind man, but I enjoyed the fact that he was put into the movie in a very organic way. I also thought the ending was dragged out a bit too much, and I was very miffed that Jo's girlfriend died, so minus one star from me. But then again its movies that make us feel all kinds of emotions, so one star is added for its realism and lack of tact. Thank you.",10,7,17,5 October 2017
Captain Marvel," Could have been epic
","The point of making a Superhero comic or person is to make them extremely gifted in one way and flawed in another. In Captain Marvel, Carol is given everything, from flight, to super strength, to the ability to breathe in space, and no weaknesses, not a quarrel with her best friend, not any view of the world that is questionable, she is just perfect and anyone who questions any part of her is going to get smashed to bits. That is like the first Superman comic where he had nothing but perfection. It was so boring seeing her destroy everything that was even a bit of a threat because there was absolutely no sense of danger at all after the first hour of the movie. I don't get why they have to do this to a marvel hero, many female characters have flaws and yet they are brave regardless, this one doesn't have a misstep of adversity, she just got all the right thoughts out of the bat, didn't learn from anything, just a version of god except one that cares about silly human things. The movie had a great hour though, that is why it is rated at 5, I thought they are gonna make a believable hero, but I guess she is not allowed to have any flaws or weaknesses, which is pretty pointless, might as well make her destroy Thanos immediately and become supreme leader of the universe while she is at it. Then we can all save money on the End Game.",5,3,6,20 March 2019
Interstellar," A very good movie about space, science and other concepts
","The director managed to make the insertion into space and science with high concepts of love, moral values and the social construct of a person. That is pretty fascinating, though none of these values were deeply explored, they were considered when dealing with great events that shape consciousness and that is successful for me already. It would have been easy to feel bogged down and overwhelmed by such concepts if done badly, but the director did well to make these stand out to be considered and hopefully that could mean a higher level of thinking for us in the future. Though such stuff is foolhardy to expect from anyone so that is also indicative of our potential greatness if we could make it happen at least often enough to be elevated in our minds.",10,0,0,17 March 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," James Gunn displayed his big guns and iron back
","This movie should have been terrible, because of the time limit, the lack of good material to work with and a fatigue of rag tag team genre. However, that being said, Mister Gunn brought out the big guns in writing, in direction, in keeping the team together and it shows in a great adventure, something out of the playbook of a space opera wildhogs. There is a great sense of being in the moment and each time we thought the magic would fade, it strengthens just a little. This is by no means the only story Mister Gunn wanted to say, because we can tell from it his great passion for the arts, but it was one that was still pretty awesome. The cast retained their great chemistry and flaws and that is pretty neat, given we are normally washed down with generic characters with blandness of a overbearing sense of perfection. There is none of that here, and the sense of vulnerability was good. The plethora of legit human emotions make me confident in vol.3 and the music was still good, so lets believe in the next ride because it will probably be the same given the dreaded sequel was not blowing up in the flames of first film's own initial success.

Wonder Woman," Its a brilliant marketing masterpiece
","I guess this is how they will make movies now. The story is bad, the acting is mediocre, Gadot cannot hold an American accent as well as her blue steel stare and yet it is brilliantly billed as a coming-of-age empowerment story that instantly got everyone to fall in line to support it, especially its central idea of a strong woman. The most important characteristic of this movie, following Beauty and Ghostbusters is is this the new innovation in making movies? The marketing is now more important than having a good director and it seems to be the way forward but thankfully we have tapes if we want to revel in the glories of the past, where films focused almost to a fault on characters, struggles (flaws), acting, story, props, costumes, music and design.",9,4,11,12 June 2017
Incredibles 2," This beast bucks the formulaic trend of the recent Disney movies
","Kudos to Brad for making the movie tight like a mission impossible adventure. There is a sense of danger, anticipation and then delivery of that promise, against a very believable villain, and with none of the weird generic formula that plagues recent films like 'A Force Awakens' and 'Star Trek Discovery' which really gets in the way of telling a good story. I don't know what it is, but those aforementioned films feel the same and I can't tell them apart and always feel like I watched an alternate universe rerun of the same thing. I truly believe that Pixar is on a good path with exception to Cars 3, and that is a small price to pay to keep the lights on!",9,8,11,26 June 2018
Alien: Covenant," A great version
","I wish I could see the film in more perspectives because the story is much broader than the time span of the ticket. It stretches your tastebuds in the arts by incorporating certain indulgences and many tightly made scenes. Each scene is as wonderful as the next, and when you realise it is over, you are left sad, that not everything in the trailer was in this movie, because of cuts and edits and throwouts and time, but it is a great version nonetheless, best done if nothing else would suffice. The philosophies are never heavy handed, and the scenarios are so sad yet believable. I believe in this vision, and hope there is one where Jake survived, or that there was less evil, but this version is something that I am blessed to live with, and still be happy about. Thank you Mister Scott, it was a job well done!",10,39,79,9 May 2017
