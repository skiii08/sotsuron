",This movie is crap......highly overrated.I wouldn't give it a 6. Why the heck was the movie so long.Whatever dude! My opportunity cost is too high for this kinda crap. ...major let down I must say What was that frisking...nagging background music all about by the way? I left the movie for 15 minutes...came back....and the movie was still where I had left ...incredibly boringly painfully slow .....got carried away by a 8.6 on IMDb .....oh well.mistakes made..lessons learnt......The best role was played by SCottie's secretary,3,11,32,23 June 2007
