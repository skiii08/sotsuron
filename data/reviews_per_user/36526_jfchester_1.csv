Hereditary," Not a bad movie, but great? No
","I checked several reviews and I don't get the fuzz. It's not bad, but not great either.It's a slow-moving movie and I am fine with it. Good acting by Colette, Wolf and Shapiro. But Gabriel Byrne performance is really below compare to his conterpart.But the last 10 minutes just ruined the whole thing. I am under the impression that they were running out of time to shoot and did something just to wrap up and go home. Forgetting totally the rest of the movie.People found this movie scary... Seriously? My 17 years old daughter loves horror movies and is the easiest person on earth to scare. Except for a few jump scares, she wasn't frightened at all.So if you have nothing else to watch, give it a try.",4,0,3,12 November 2018
