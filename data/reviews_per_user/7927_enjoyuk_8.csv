The Blair Witch Project," Far from the 'Scariest Movie Ever'
","After the media circus and the television programmes, I finally got to see the Blair Witch Project'.  Although it didn't live up to all the hype (most movies rarely do), I thought it was a solid, well-made film.  Forget the taglines of Scariest Movie Ever' because that's really far from the truth.It is on the other hand very unnerving at times and the final scene is particularly eerie.  The performances from the three leads are very convincing, its not pretty to watch, but they do act as though they are genuinely terrified, there is none of the `what would we do if this were a scary movie' Scream' cockiness here and that makes the performances more believable.I'm just waiting for the all too predictable backlash against the picture, just like the audience did at the Liverpool cinema I attended, who were obviously expecting a Friday the 13th' style bloodbath.If you are looking for something different from a film, forget everything you've seen or read and check out The Blair Witch Project'.",8,0,1,28 October 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Marred Classic
","This could have been a classic, but Parker & Stone if you ever read any of these comments, I have to say one thing:  Why spoil a genuinely witty and funny movie with the overuse (understatement) of really boring and unnessecary profanity.  Dont get me wrong, I am no prude, far from it, but after the initial 20 or so minutes (where swearing has a bearing on the story), it gets really tiresome.",5,0,2,1 September 1999
Billy Elliot," One word 'Fantastic'
","Billy Elliot is a class act all the way, everybody involved in the production of this fine film deserve the highest accolades.  Im glad to see the great response of some US users of IMDB. I grew up in similar surroundings to the title character and would have been around the same age during this period and I have to say that the filmmakers have created the time and atmosphere of Northern England in the early 1980s to perfection.  I wish the very best of success to this production and hope that more viewers around the world can see and enjoy a truer slice of English life than the (not to take anything away from these films) 'Notting Hill's' and 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' portrait of the UK. Utterly a Top Notch production.",9,0,0,3 October 2000
Apocalypse Now," Classic
","What can I say about this absolutely classic movie that hasn't been said in most of the IMDB comments. I really believe that this is filmmaking at its finest, the acting, direction and photography are all top notch.I do have a question for anyone who may read this comment.  I first viewed this film on a PAL (UK) videocassette and although I thought it overall to be brilliant then, I did feel the story was slightly tainted by the ending. The version I saw did not show Willard actually attack Kurtz also the scene with the Water Buffalo being sacrificed by Kurtz' followers was not included.  I have searched high and low and I cannot find any explanation for these edits on the PAL version.  I recently viewed the movie again on a region 1 DVD and the scenes described above were included which I thought was a more fitting ending to a excellent piece of American filmmaking.If anybody can shed any light on the UK release in question, please contact me on the above Email address.",Null,0,0,12 February 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Couldn't believe I actually rented this.......
","Im shuffling through Blockbuster thinking to myself 'What shall I waste my £3.75 on tonight'. Being a big fan of Action/Sci-fi and previously renting such crap as 'Red Planet' & 'The 6th Day', I decided to take home a movie of a genre which I am not a fan of, namely Martial Arts/Foreign Language films. Just for a change.After spending most of the night milling around the house trying to get myself around to sitting through two hours of subtitles and 'Matrix' style fighting nonsense. I stuck 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' into the old DVD player.How surprised was I to witness of the most involving, beautifully photographed/choreographed films I have ever seen. I Even enjoyed the outlandish fight scenes which I think mar good movies like 'Matrix' & 'Blade' & just about every other film with fight sequences produced since. What a breath of fresh air. I cant say enough good words about this production. Top Notch 9/10",9,0,0,19 June 2001
Scream 2," Highly glossy, highly trashy
","Scream 2 is a poor movie, honestly!.  I must admit I wasnt a big fan of the first one, and I didnt expect too much of the second.  You would think that all the 'SMART' pretty young things, who spout off all the way through the film their knowledge of horror movies, would simply leave town for couple of weeks until the murderer was captured.  The Killer in the Scream series must be the biggest joke going, for all the amazing things he does like chasing down police cars and killing two armed cops, you would think that he would be able to chase someone through a house without clumsily tripping up over everything and anything.  Scary, my arse. I spent the best part of eight years in the states, and I never met anyone as irritating and as annoying there as the college kids in this movie, I was practically shouting for the killer as he bumped off this annoying lot.Here are are few questions that have been floating around my mind since subjecting myself to Scream 2: Is Dewey related to Michael Myers? You can stab him 1500 times and he still survives at the end.Why does the killer always turn into some third-rate comedian when unmasked? and then really emphasise the word 'F**k' when speaking.Why does Wes Craven never have a likeable character in any of his movies?Is there any overweight or normal looking people at Sydney's College?WHAT the hell was that terrible, terrible music all about that came on whenever Dewey & Gale were in the same scene.And finally...... Why does everyone hero worship Kevin Williamson and why is his name above anyone elses on the movie posters?.  The best thing he ever wrote was the first season of Dawson's Creek (I wont take that away from him).Scream 3, No Thank you Messrs. Craven & Williamson",2,2,5,25 September 1999
The Green Mile," Highest praise to all involved in making this movie!
","What a fantastic film.  I am not the biggest Tom Hanks fan but I couldnt imagine this movie with anybody else in the role of Paul Edgecombe.  Mr Hanks and the rest of the cast are excellent and really bring all the characters alive.  I cant believe some of the negative reviews I have seen for 'The Green Mile' even if the story isnt your cup of tea, you have got to admit that it is a first rate production. Frank Darabont PLEASE make more movies like this!.",10,0,1,2 July 2000
The Sixth Sense," Unforgettable, Haunting & Brilliant
","What a year at the movies, with the exception of The Haunting' and a couple of minor turkeys, I cannot remember a better year for cinema-going.  As the year plodded on I thought the best had come and gone until I saw The Sixth Sense', wow, what a brilliant film.  Everything about this movie is top notch from the acting, the story, and script, commendation has definitely got to go to the actors, everybody from Bruce Willis to Toni Collette (from Muriel's Wedding) were perfectly cast and all gave career high performances. The Sixth Sense' grabs you from the opening and doesn't let go until its fantastic conclusion, and for a fairly slow paced story you simply cannot take your eyes from the screen. If you like to be scared, this is the movie watch, forget all the garbage Hollywood has been shoving down our throats, Yes Scream' and I Know What You Did Last Summer', I am talking about you.  Lets hope that future productions use this style of chiller as a blueprint instead of the thoroughly unimaginative slasher' movies of recent years.The Sixth Sense' has got to be one of the top movies of the year, if not the decade.  I watched the film over a week ago and I still think about it, that's just how haunting an experience it is.   My highest praise goes out to everyone involved in the making of this unforgettable, excellent motion picture.",Null,0,0,15 November 1999
