Requiem for a Dream," draining and crappy!!!!!
","sorry to offend anyone but i think this movie really sucked!!!! its message was simple enough. drugs will ruin your life. thats great but it simply did not work for me. the scenes with jared leto's mom were grating and repetitive to the point where they just became annoying, as opposed to making me feel pity for her drug dependency and isolation. way too long, trite, and just over the top. if you want to see a good 'drugs are bad' movie, watch drugstore cowboy, traffic, Jesus' son, or even trainspotting. jennifer connelly is probably the movie's highlight and the 'end to end' scene is actually pretty harrowing. overall though, i don't think i would want to watch this movie again.",4,3,7,21 August 2006
