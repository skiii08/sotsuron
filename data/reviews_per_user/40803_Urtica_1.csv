The Blair Witch Project," More hype than film
","I heard all about this film so I finally went and saw it.  Now I am wondering what the rave reviews were about.  Perhaps I missed something? But it seems to me to be an OK movie only.  It wasn't that scary...it really wasn't *that* anything.  It was not exceptional in any way.  There was perhaps some innovative cinematography, but that would be about it.  I had a friend dare me to go camping right after seeing it.  I think if I had a battery-powered TV, it wouldn't bother me to watch it while I was camping.",5,0,2,21 February 2000
