The Blair Witch Project," Only for the naive
","I believe the only people who enjoyed 'The Blair Witch Project' were those who naively believed the fiction - i.e., that some kids actually died in the woods leaving film footage behind. My friends and I were disappointed, bored and distinctly un-scared. Yeah, it was a great idea; but it needed a frame, of interviews, back story, etc. I've seen lots better stuff on Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock.",1,0,3,12 August 1999
