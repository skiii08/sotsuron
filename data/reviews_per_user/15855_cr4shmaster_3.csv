10 Cloverfield Lane," Captivating and unpredictable.
","I love it when a movie keeps making me guess what is about to happen. I love it even more when I'm wrong. And I was wrong a lot watching this.I could almost call this a masterpiece, if it weren't for 2 important details:
1. The ending was rushed, I wanted more of that.
2. Howard should not have mentioned anything about aliens. That way, the ending would have had a much bigger impact.",8,0,0,14 June 2020
Constantine," Excellent movie!
","I wish people would stop comparing movies to the comics/books they are inspired from. That's why Constantine got so low reviews when it came out.If you forget the fact that it's based on a DC comic, the movie is flawless; 2 hours of pure cinematic excellence. There's great acting, a wisely written plot that's not too predictable but easy to follow, and not a second wasted.Definitely watch this, you will not regret it!",10,0,0,4 July 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Great acting, no plot.
","Sure, the acting was spot on, but then that's exactly what you would expect from top actors like these.As for the plot, well, it's not there. There are 2 and a half hours of bits and pieces glued together by a narrator, followed by a 10-minute classic Tarantino gory scene and an ending that's completely irrelevant.",3,2,8,14 June 2020
