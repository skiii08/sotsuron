Lucky Number Slevin," State of the Art
","OH MY GOD!!!!!!!! I just finished watching it, just another piece of art. That movie should be rated 10/10. Highly recommended but not for less than 18 years age I think this is the best movie Willis had since Die Hard. I never get too excited to top vote a movie unless I really get to be confused and that means, not knowing who is who and all the tricky things writers and directors try to set you with. I was absolutely on the other side of thinking for just one second, that Slevin is the same kid as Max, well I know it is ironic how he kept playing dumb but that's the beauty of it or else, the movie would have been a low one.",10,4,8,27 June 2006
