The Equalizer," Equal to what -predictable sugar or the substitute
","The equalizer is a formula movie. I guess the actor was in between doing something interesting. It was cute to see him save Russian hookers if that is your idea of living vicariously though a lot of psychotherapy as to why you will never make it. He seems to be lost in a giant hardware store like the ones we all go to. Of course what a better place than there to have action scenes like chasing people. It was sort of Superman without the cape and tights. Basically, Mr. Washington is predictable and although remotely interesting, you know exactly what is going to happen. He wins every fight (just like Superman) and no one is even close to beating him. The writers do show a few levels of creativity with how to kill the bad guys. They seem to neglect the obvious of using identity theft which seems to be the biggest scare we all have when using our credit card in a store like that. Robert Stack",4,12,23,27 September 2014
