Ali," Will Smith's Oscar worthy performance is alone worth watching this film over and over again.
","For me, this has to be one of the greatest biography films of all time. All the scenes in this film are superbly directed and acted out. The story is told really beautifully and I think the film is a good lesson about the great man himself's life for anyone who doesn't already now about him, and also for people who know little about him. Also, characters such as Howard Cosell and others have been portrayed brilliantly, to very fine detail. I also think that Will Smith's Oscar worthy performance is alone worth watching this film over and over again. Also, if you are a boxing fan you will like the fights featured in this film as they have been made more realistically then other boxing films such as the great 'Rocky' series. My message to everyone is, whether or not you like Muhammed Ali or boxing you just simply HAVE TO WATCH THIS FILM.",10,1,2,1 August 2006
