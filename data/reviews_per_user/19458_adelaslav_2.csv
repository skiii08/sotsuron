Black Swan," A haunting and beautiful cinema masterpiece
","I've seen this movie so many times, I probably already know the lines. For me, this movie just brings together a lot of stuff that I really like (being about the dancing world, here ballet in particular, great cinematography, being a psychological thriller, having Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis in it, being directed by the genius of Darren Aronofsky) and is pretty much one of my visions of an ideal cinematic experience. The acting is so good and just the whole story is so... scary and haunting and beautiful at the same time, that you're left after this in a dream-like state. One of my favourite movies that I've watched so far",Null,1,1,23 June 2018
Interstellar," A pure cinematographic masterpiece
","This is yet another one of my all-time favourite movies. This is a full experience, which I loved to have enjoyed at the cinema. During this movie I just felt transported, and I left the theatre mesmerized, and just utterly... moved in a way. Everything from the cinematography to the acting is done to perfection, but my ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE part is the spundtrack: ot just does this movie justice, and to be honest I actually teared a bit while listening it. That's the magic of Hans Zimmer, no doubt about that.",Null,0,0,23 June 2018
