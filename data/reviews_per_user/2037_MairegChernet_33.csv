Frost_Nixon," An excellent portrayal of a controversial president.
","Frost/Nixon is one of the best film of the year, and certainly a strong contender for best picture. Langella's marvelous performance as the bedazzled Richard Nixon and Michael Sheen's terrific portrayal of the rigorous David Frost combined with Ron Howard's magnificent direction make the movie a memorable one. Not only that but the supporting cast- including Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon, Matthew MacFayden and Olvier Platt- was also phenomenal. Frost/Nixon is an epic, an epic that involves not guns and human sacrifices but words and tense emotions. It's also a historically significant film, for all who crave to know what really happened and whether or not Nixon didn't 'obstruct any laws.' In short Frost/Nixon is an amazing film filled with sharp dialogues, amazing performances and tense and provocative sentiments as well as an explosive yet subtle ending.10/10 Go see it!",10,63,80,25 January 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Truly Incredible.
","***MILD SPOILERS*** The Incredible Hulk lives up to its name. It is truly incredible from start to finish. It makes you hate the 2003 version and almost makes you become obsessed with it. Edward Norton plays his role amazingly as Bruce Banner, where he is wanted as a fugitive and is being hunted down by the government, whose malicious intention is to manipulate his gene and use it as a weapon in the U.S. military. Edward Norton plays a die hard fugitive who is not willing to give into the government's plans, and his performance almost makes you forget about Dr. Richard David Kimble(Harrison Ford in The Fugitive). We see Bruce Banner transform into this gigantic beast in numerous scenes, and those scenes are highly intense and involve hi-tech machinery and amazing fight sequences. Alongside Bruce Banner, we see Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, a caring and lovable character.Tim Roth also played a villain perfectly. Overall, This film contains both great action and a storyline that's everything but superficial.9.5/10",10,4,8,17 July 2008
Catch Me If You Can," Just do the math
",DiCaprio + Spielberg = Sheer brilliance. Catch Me If You Can is another awesome flick by the legendary Steven Spielberg. And DiCaprio's top notch performance as the brilliant con master combined with Tom Hanks' amazing performance as the committed FBI agent illuminated the already shiny film. The film from beginning to end is filled with suspense and tense chase scenes. And the fact that it was set in the sixties gave it an archaic and classical touch. I admire and respect DiCaprio even more now. His tremendous acting skills are advancing with each passing film and we expect to see more from him.,8,2,3,24 January 2009
Kung Fu Panda," Kung Fu Panda redeems DreamWorks.
","Dreamworks Animation, after the mediocre third installment of the Shrek series, hasn't really been outstanding. Rather, it had dimmed in the shadows of oblivion. It's major rival Disney, on the other hand, has been successful with films like Wall E. But now with a star-studded cast and a smart script, DreamWorks makes a comeback with Kung Fu Panda, which is a film filled with 'awesomeness'. Jack Black does the voice of Po the Panda, and he does it great. Every scene Po is in belongs to him, in other word it makes the other characters look inferior, not weight-wise, although he is a pretty big animal. Another thing about this film is the absence of humans. Every character in the film is an animal whether a tiny insect or a frightening rhino. That sets the frivolous mood of the film, although it's not as frivolous as some might expect it. Had its fair share of plot twists and great jokes. Oh yeah lots of great jokes. Don't take this movie for a subtle one, and don't have little or no expectations of it because surely it will shatter your expectations just like it shattered the box office.",8,1,2,25 August 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Top notch Tarantino material
","He does it again. The king of blood and gore once again proves that he can keep audiences entertained for almost 2 and a half hours. Inglourious Basterds is a Tarantino classic in many aspects. One, it offers plenty of violence and bloodshed. From Start to finish, heads are blown off, people are shot fatally and scalps are cut off gruesomely. Second, it has Brad freakin' Pitt. Tarantino movies always have one or two stars and a million up and coming actors. In this case, Pitt and Roth shine out while the rest of the supporting cast do an outstanding job of portraying their minor roles (not to forget Melanie Laurent.) Third thing is, the direction is wonderful. The sound effects, the camera shots, all the cinematographic aspects are excellent.In short, Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is an exhilarating action flick that is full of entertainment from start to finish.",9,3,9,25 December 2009
Dawn of the Dead," This is how remakes should be made.
",I have not seen the original Dawn of The Dead. However seeing this awesome remake I want to see the original and compare the two. Zack Snyder makes this unforgettable remake by taking George A. Romeo's screenplay and adding the new millennium's CGI effects. 90 percent of the film is filled with zombie action and blood splattering all over. The other 10 percent focuses on the main characters' back ground info and characters turning on one another.Although I shouldn't say this this without watching the first This is perhaps the best remake of all time. A new era for Zack Snyder. Overall A very Good slasher movie.,8,0,0,9 June 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," More of a romance than a comedy.
","The Apatow group makes another film which by the way isn't a stoner comedy. For me Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a more of a romance movie. It's no match for other comedies from the same group such as Superbad and is also far from being hilarious. It's indeed smart and witty at times, But the jokes in this film aren't consistent, as they were in the other films. The film's characters for the most part are all funny, such as Aldous and the Hawaiian waiters. The actors also were awesome. The film is occasionally funny and in comparison to other Apatow films it's not as good but is not bad either.My rating 6.8/10",7,3,9,10 August 2008
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," perhaps I have misjudged this show.
","I know it's a little late to write a comment on the south park movie but i must do it for some reason, maybe because the movie has warped my little fragile mind, or may be because when the movie debuted I was just a little kid.I am not a south park fan, and I don't really keep track of the episodes. The show is nothing to me more than vulgarity and plain outrage. But a couple of days ago a friend of mine lent me the movie DVD, and what I have to say to the creators is kudos for making such an awesome movie. what is awesome about it is that it is centered on one storyline and revolves around it. there were no subplots or anything. the storyline's basis is the incident of the four boys watching the infamous Canadian Terrence and Phillip movie that's full of foul language and consequently causes U.S.A. to declare war on Canada. I usually don't like movies that are filled with obscenities, but there was something about the south park movie that made it O.K to swear. Instead of being offensive, the frequent obscenities were hysterically amusing. No matter what parents say about the offensive language in this movie, it's inevitable that,at some point, vulgarities stop being offensive but become funny.Another thing that was awesome about the movie was the musicals. Actually the musicals is what I like about the movie the most. My top three musicals would be,#3, what would Brian Boitano do? #2, Kyle's mom is a b----#1, it's easy m'kay. The musicals were not only fast and inaudible unless you put on the subtitles, they were also hilarious. All the musical were fast paced and it was almost impossible to hear the lyrics. But if you do hear the lyrics, you will laugh your A$$ off. sorry, apparently I have been influenced by the movie's vulgarities.I heard this movie was nominated for an Oscar. And before seeing it i was wondering how? but after seeing it, I wondered no more. The south park movie is definitely Oscar worthy, and what's funny is how Matt Stone and Trey Parker showed up at the red carpet with their bizarre looks.(wearing girly dresses)My overall perspective of this movie is fast paced, interesting and hilarious, and definitely bigger, longer and uncut.",10,1,1,20 March 2008
Balls of Fury," Simplistic and shallow.
","Balls of Fury could have been a lot better. The idea of the movie is somewhat a solid one. But unfortunately the execution and the script weren't. Balls of Fury somehow seemed like a short movie. The writers just jammed every part of the movie from exposition to resolution together without paying thorough attention to each one. Of course there were a couple of chuckles and of course it might have made us laugh a bit every now and then. But the film lacked substance. Without even giving the audience time to absorb what the story is about, the movie reaches its climax and ends. Again, it could have been a lot better, but unfortunately ends up being another wasted idea.",5,1,2,10 August 2008
Superbad," Crude, cheeky and mainly funny.
","Superbad tells a tale of three friends and their last moments as high school seniors. It is a well deserved R-Rated film. It has a lot of crude remarks and gestures, which by the way are hilarious. The writers didn't seem to hold back themselves or be held back by anyone from including these strong humors that mainly teenagers would find hilarious. The film involves a lot of alcohol and drugs, and various rude yet funny remarks. Superbad is a true masterpiece in its genre, a shameless comedy that resembles the other movies such as knocked up and the 40 year old virgin.7.6/10",7,2,4,25 July 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," the cliché-ridden script is made up for by Jackman's captivating performance and the awesome action scenes.
","I can't remember a single negative thing I noticed in this film while watching it, but once I was done watching it I felt like there was some kind of void in the film. I felt as though the film was missing something, maybe it was the cheap special effects or the repetitive narration and plot build up style. Either way this film was missing something that kept it from becoming a classic. However, I thoroughly enjoyed Jackman's performance as Wolverine as well as Liev Schreiber's as Sabretooth. This movie is not near to the depth or the intelligence of X2 or other superhero films but it manages to deliver mindless entertainment worth the price of the ticket.",8,1,2,14 June 2009
The Others," Spooky and Dark, yet enjoyable
","For a PG-13 suspense film, The Others is definitely a good film. Nicole Kidman's Religiously devoted character and her photosensitive children make the film very frightening. The film focuses on a woman and her two kids who live in a spooky house that they believe to be haunted(the film sets right around the end of WWII). I had lots of doubts about this film. But ironically, what I found put me in a complete awe. The film starts out kind of lazy. The first half of the film did not capture my interest, as opposed to the second half, where the beast of suspense and thrill was unleashed. I definitely enjoyed this film and it's once again proved that foreign directors have a knack for making awesome flicks.",Null,2,3,6 June 2008
Juno," Impressive and touching
","Juno Macguff is a sixteen year old teenage girl who faces unexpected pregnancy and makes absurd decisions regarding her unborn baby. This is an exceptional film. A movie like this comes once or twice every year. A low budget and subtle movie but then becomes exponentially popular. At first I had low expectations for this movie and it was for reasons. One reason is that the cast is fledgling and the second and main reason was because of who wrote it (no offense). But seeing it winning an academy award and hearing all the hype about it led me to finally give it a shot. And boy, was I wrong about this movie. I was in a complete awe. What makes Juno exceptional is the fact that the main character, though facing many problems both internal and external, manages to fix a smile on her face and acts as if the whole thing was just a joke. Many other pictures with the same tone of teenage pregnancy all have one aim, and that is to show the audience the darker side of teenage pregnancy and possibly try to make us cry and no laughs.however, in the case of Juno, the main character, Juno, was both hilarious and the audience felt sorry for her at the same time. There were lots of laughs, sarcasm, and indeed sobs.",7,5,14,18 April 2008
Resident Evil: Extinction," A little bit above the line of mediocrity.
","Resident evil 3 starts out mediocre, and from that standpoint I was expecting a good an hour and a half. Sure there was more action and more credible plot than the first two.....but not enough of the actionA fairly interesting storyline.....At least interesting enough to keep my attention. But frankly I was expecting way more violence. Don't misconstrue me here. I did not hate this movie. it's just that I was expecting more and what I got was average.Although this film is not an impressive action film, it had some interesting aspects. To start with it was filled with a brilliant cast. The acting was vital and it has serious actors suitable for their roles. Also the special effects were amazing. Whoever did the makeup for the zombies should be proud.The other thing I liked was the linkage of all the scenes to one another, nowadays movies are made(such as 'The Grudge' franchise) in such a way where you need to rewind and fast forward in order to grasp the purpose of the scenes. in the contrary in 'Resident Evil:Extinction' the sequences were highly comprehensible from the very beginning to the end. The scenes weren't filled with junk dialogues.I have said these positive things about this movie. Yet as overrated as it was I was expecting a mind blowing action and a remarkable film that leaves me with nothing to say but 'WOW'. For a third movie in the franchise, extinction is not bad at all. However it doesn't surpass the hype.",7,0,2,1 January 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Much more than a mere comic book film.
","Guillermo del Toro once again proves that he is truly a visionary director, not just because of all the monsters in this movie but by how he went beyond the beyond and proved that sequels can be better than the original. Hellboy 2 is a great mix of everything you want in a movie. Starting from comedy to romance to action and beyond. And how Del Toro was able to mix these things together was just extraordinary.Hellboy 2, compared to other comic book superhero movies, is exceptional. Let's start off with the cast. Almost everyone from the original is back in this one. Ron Pearlman, as always, does a great job of playing a sarcastic monster from hell whose appearance is the only thing that's monster-like. We see Pearlman's character being a caring and thoughtful almost human-like creature. Liz Sherman(Blair) also is a lovely character though sometimes feisty. And even though we don't get to see his face Doug Jones does a good job of playing Abe Sapien. New to the cast (and also face not seen) is Johann Krauss whose voice over was provided by Seth Macfarlane, the two time Emmy winner and creator of Family Guy and American Dad. As far as the plot is concerned,it's about Prince Nauda and his return from the so-called lost world and start a rebellion against humankind with the aid of his abominable golden army. We see this storyline being illuminated by an excellent screenplay written by, you guessed it, Guillermo del Toro. He brings a great screenplay combines it with a great cast and a bunch of monsters, and what do we get? One of the greatest comic book based movies of all time.As said on the very first paragraph, Don't expect Hellboy 2 to be just an action/fantasy movie. It is much more than that. Throughout the film, there were on and off funny moments(not pee-in-your-pants funny) but still really funny for an action film. It also had its share of romantic moments. In the intention of not spoiling the film, there won't be any more expansion on the romance part. And last but not least, the obvious. The film is action packed and fast paced. The fight scenes are spectacular and very entertaining.Lots of visually stunning monsters, lots of fights including sword fights and some off-screen deaths. In conclusion, Hellboy 2 is a great improvement from the first one and it is indeed an exceptional comic book film. Itis highly impressive and again visually stunning. Go see it. It's worth the price of your ticket.",8,1,4,16 August 2008
Wanted," The best action movie in years.
","WOW, This is a movie I won't soon forget, it's like the film is planted in the back of my brain where it would never get out, the film from beginning to the very last word is just delicious and you find yourself asking for more when it's over just like a delicious meal you just ate but didn't have enough of. The best slow motion effects since The Matrix and the most profane characters since The Departed were shown in Wanted. And not to forget the most amount of violence every action fanatic would ask for. As far as the story goes, Wanted is a tale of a guy named Wesley Gibson who works as an accounts manager and basically lets others stab him in the back and treat him like crap. But soon he realizes that he is destined to succeed his father who was a specially skilled assassin and worked with other assassins who call themselves as 'The Fraternity'. As revelations are gradually made Wesley finds out who his real enemies are and why he got tangled up in his so called destiny in the first place. James McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, and I couldn't have asked for a better performance. He was phenomenal. I always enjoy his performances, whether he plays a physician for a notorious tyrant in The Last King of Scotland, or he plays half a human and half a something else as Mr. Tumnus in The Chronicles of Narnia. In Wanted, there is no difference, he is flawless at every angle and he does some awesome things in the film, from curving bullets to shooting people from a mile or two or even more away or even shooting the wings off of tiny flies. Nevertheless he had some serious actors with him who got their shares of bullet curving. Jolie who plays Fox and Freeman who plays Sloan, Both astonishing, as always. Amazing chemistry throughout the movie and the actors were just awesome.I would suggest a sequel for this piece of art. It was brilliant and has a plot twist that turned the whole film around, though a bit unrealistic, yet again really cool special effects, and did teach a little lesson about how we shouldn't let others step all over us, and even if a sequel doesn't come out, this will be a movie, as I already said, that won't be soon forgotten.",10,8,19,26 July 2008
Ratatouille," take the last scene from mouse hunt + animate it + set it in Paris = ratatouille
","Nothing special.....I walked into the theater to see Ratatouille for two reasons.(1)to finally see a good pixar flick (2)well, there was this strange urge in my body, perhaps a sound, that kept yelling 'go see it, go see it'And believe me, the feeling I had after watching the movie was somehow the opposite of the feeling I had before watching it.I walked in feeling anxious and overwhelmed .....yet a bit skeptic (I always have my doubts about Disney movies.)......And I walked out with a feeling that ringed 'that's it.' I felt deceived. But then I realized that it's a Disney movie, which meant it's okay if it's not as good as they said it would be. Disney movies are always overrated. but as overrated as it was, I was expecting a way better movie. .......frankly this movie doesn't deserve all the nominations and awards it has..... yes it might have made me chuckle once in a while.....yes it it might have kept me from walking out of the the theater......and yes it might have entertained me a bit...but it didn't impress me at all. especially compared to 'the incredibles' and 'Cars', it is not a good movie.overall, it is not bad......it is not good.....just mediocre6/10",6,1,3,19 January 2008
Tropic Thunder," Tropic Thunder is the best comedy of the year.
","Stiller, Black, Downey Jr. you put those three guys together and what do you expect other than a ridiculously hilarious masterpiece. And not to mention Tom Cruise's cameo as Les Grossman. Tropic Thunder is a success for Ben Stiller and for all involved in the making. It's a great political satire and defines parody real well. The film is either making you laugh or providing you with mind-blowing action. It's a great satirical comedy that'll keep you laughing hysterically.The movie of course is not all about the profanity and utter gore, it is more about the acting. Robert Downey Jr., after the success of Iron Man, makes a comeback with Tropic Thunder and boy was he great. Almost throughout the whole movie he is disguised as a black man not only by the way he looks but also the way he talked and acted. He did it in a somewhat of an exploitational manner which by the way was hilarious and even gets questioned by one of his fellow actors why he's still in character knowing that they are not making a movie anymore, for which he responds 'I don't drop a character till I done the DVD commentary'. Seeing this movie should make every movie goer realize that Robert Downey Jr. is a very talented man who handles both comedy and actions and about anything else that gets thrown onto him.As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, all of them were thoroughly enjoyable, starting from the desperate actor Tugg Speedman(Stiller) to the drug addicted fatty Jeff Portnoy(Blcak), and the somewhat witty and young rapper Chino(Jackson). They were all irresistible. Not to forget the surprise cameo by Tom Cruise no one saw coming. His character is really irreverent and mainly laugh out loud funny, (especially the way he answered the ransom call). His character Les Grossman is very foul-mouthed and has short temper and is very hilarious.The concept of the film is very simple yet smart. The goal is to poke fun at war movies which the film did very well and provide the audience with smart and dumb jokes at the same time. And one thing Very impressive about this film is that it wasn't self-indulgent. It knew whether or not the jokes hit their target, and if they didn't they weren't prolonged. They were quick and most of them hit their mark like a bullet. Stiller is becoming more than an actor these days. He is displaying his intelligence by writing directing and acting all at once. We will look forward to his next project which I think is going be Night at the Museum 2. TROPIC THUNDER RULES. THE BEST ACTION/COMEDY OF THE YEAR.",10,4,11,31 August 2008
Quantum of Solace," A brief comment on Quamtum of Solace.
","Okay here we go. QS delivers strong performances from all the actors and actresses, starting from Daniel Craig and Judi Dench all the way to Olga Kurylenko. It also features a breathtaking series of frequent action scenes, combined with wonderful special effects. In addition it displays a wide range of settings. While these positives might sway away those reading this, the negatives will definitely make them think twice. Okay here go the negatives.QS lags behind other Bond films including Casino Royale and those before it because of its bizarre plot, its unstable character build up, and its multitude of villains, who, I felt, did not get enough screen time. The James Bond suave, though debatable, is still there. The action in this one is still as riveting as in its predecessors, the Bond is still awesome. However QS is not as good as the other Bond films, yet Marc Forster should be proud of sustaining the delight in a saga that began before he was born...",6,1,3,16 November 2008
The Butterfly Effect," The Butterfly Effect, an average film, whose cons almost outweigh its pros
","***MILD SPOILERS*** The butterfly effect is a film directed by two men whose names don't sound familiar to the average movie goer such as myself. But that's beside the point, because talent doesn't always come with fame. And I don't even need to give an example for that. The world is filled with those kinds of people. Anyways, my point is these two directors are putting tremendous effort into writing and directing this movie and I give them credit for that. And now let me get to the actual film and its pros and cons.The butterfly effect is far from being a bad movie. It has its fair share of thrills with a somehow enjoyable plot. But it fails to be a stable and centered film. One thing I couldn't stand in the film was its redundancy. The scenes were a replica of each other. Kutcher's character would go back in his thoughts and fix something and he would do that a million times in the movie. What I am saying is show me something new. Also show me something orderly. It was hard for me to tell where the climax is and if it already happened or if it's yet to happen. In other words it was hard for me to keep up with the film.Another thing was the casting; I mean come on Ashton Kutcher I mean after such a comedy as Dude where's my car I didn't expect to see him in a psychological thriller. Not that I'm saying he was bad in the movie but I could see somebody else playing the role a whole lot better, (Edward Norton would have been my first choice if I was the casting director, or maybe Jake Gyllenhaal), anyone with the capability of setting a dark tone, but Ashton Kutcher is best fit for a comedy role. But whatever.Although I say all these negative things, I did like the movie to some extent. One thing I did like was the fact that the film is filled with high tension and constant chills. Not knowing how Evan's life is going to turn out is the best feeling I had in the movie. And till the very end that's what I wanted to know. Is Evan going to fix the mistakes he made in life? Is Evan ever going to live a stable life? Or is Evan going to share his father's destiny? Those were the questions I asked while watching the film. The questions were partially answered but the film remains to be a watchable but not a wonderful one.",6,0,2,18 October 2008
The Number 23," a great performance by Jim Carey
","At first I thought Jim Carrey was a man of comedy. But in this movie Jim Carey displayed his tremendous talent. This movie took me on a thrill ride from the very beginning to the end. The Number 23, in my opinion, is one of the best thriller movies, and one of Jim Carey's best movies.when I first saw this movie I did not think it would be such a brilliant movie. but i changed my mind after the movie rolled for some 30 minutes. this is a smart film ....smart plot....thrill from begin to end........and best of all Jim Carrey.... if you think Jim Carrey could only do comic movies, you are somewhat right...... but still he was great in this one too....so i suggest that you watch this movie, 23 times if possible.",8,2,3,26 November 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not bad. Just mediocre.
","In the third installment, Brett Ratner (Rush Hour) takes over the saga. And I actually found it somewhat entertaining but at the same time disappointing. I don't know if it was the multitude of villains that made me like it or the CGi filled action scenes, or maybe the fact that Logan's claws seem to have gotten longer. I don't know.Alas, the film lags behind the other X-Men movies due to many flaws. One is that the X-men are united no more. (as they were in the previous two films) and worst of all we see Jean entering 'the dark side.' This just made the film tasteless. Two, not only were the sequences bizarre but Ratner and crew did not dedicate enough time to character and plot development, as opposed to action-filled and explosive scenes.Was X-Men 3 entertaining? Sure. Was it filled with lots of action? Of course. Did it have multiples of villains and good guys? Most definitely. But was it made up of a concrete plot, a steady character build up and edge-of-your-seat moments? Not really. I wouldn't bet on that.Once again we witness that sequels are worse than the original. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't as expected. 6.8/10",7,0,0,25 January 2009
I Am Legend," Smith Lands on top of the box office for the 7th consecutive time.
","I don't think anyone of us is surprised to see another masterful performance from Will Smith. He is always delivering strong performances whether in romantic comedies such as Hitch or dramas like The Pursuit of Happiness. In I am Legend, Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a scientist who happens to be the only survivor in New York city to a deadly epidemic because of his immunity to the virus that's causing the epidemic.The epidemic has killed several and transformed others into vampire-like zombies who are sensitive to UV rays. With that in mind Neville(smith) roams the day wandering around the abandoned New York city looking for 'infected' zombies to trap and possibly find a cure for the epidemic. The film has superb acting and a good chemistry...between Smith and his dog. The two shine in this PG-13 remake that surpasses the original.I was reading some of the user comments on this film, and one user complained about the film's CGI. I agree 100%. The zombies in this film didn't look nothing as good as zombies from other movies in the same genre such as 28 Days Later and Dawn of The Dead. And the zombies did look like they walked straight out of a video game. But I think the makers might have decided to create CGI zombies instead of real people with prosthetics for a reason. I think the reason is that they wanted to keep it as PG-13 as possible. Still though, I believe they could have done better with the special effects and make up.Other than that minor problem, I am Legend is another masterpiece coming from the fresh prince. The film caught my attention from beginning to end and the film ended with a predictable but very touching and powerful ending. Spectacular film.",8,0,1,7 July 2008
Transformers," The combination of stunning visuals, awesome action-filled scenes, Shia LaBeouf's tremendous performance and Michael Bay's top-notch direction make Transformers a hit.
","Enough said, because those are the four things this futuristic movie relied upon. Action-filled scenes, Direction, visuals and LaBeouf. Michael Bay, after a box office success with Bad boys 2, makes a comeback with Transformers, a film based on the popular animated series. And let me just say I got what I was looking for, a simple film filled with a bad guy loses good guy wins scenario, and a film filled with heavy special effects. Michael bay directed the film to his best. And one constituent that rose above the rest was LaBeouf's tremendous performance. The Even Stevens star gives a top-notch performance filled with huge laughter, energy and the usual a teenage boy has a crush on a girl story. But above all lies the consistent and exhilarating action in the film along with the personification of the alien robots and the stunning visuals, that had me longing for more.",8,2,4,19 December 2008
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight, an Oscar worthy masterpiece.
","The problem is not that this film is so good, yet it's that I don't know where to start. Every aspect of 'The Dark Knight' is beyond extraordinary. Every tiny detail in this movie is done with utter brilliance. Let's start off with the acting. Though the star of the film is Christian Bale, who plays the caped crusader known as Batman, I think we all know who the real star is. The late Heath Ledger, playing the psychopathic maniac, blew everybody away with the best performance of his life(that's just my opinion, some of you might have liked him better in Brokeback Mountain). When I say best performance of his life, I am not being sympathetic, although he does deserve the sympathy of every movie-goer for his tragic and unexpected death, when I say best I mean best, I have never seen a villain being played so wonderfully. Jack Nicholson is no way near to being as good as ledger for the joker's role. Nicholson would have made us laugh and we would have just looked at him as our relative with a bipolar disorder. However Ledger's performance is in a completely different world. From his creepy make up and scars, to his wicked sinister laugh. The Dark Knight has to be the best movie of this summer and perhaps the whole year. Everything in the movie is wonderful. The acting was top notch....I couldn't have asked for better directing techniques nor could I thought of somebody who could have played the roles better. In comparison with the 2005 film 'Batman Begins', I am pretty sure we all know which is better.Every aspect of The Dark Knight is better than Batman Begins, the gadgets are modified, the villains are more intricate, and the action is more satisfying(although I was hoping to see Katie Holmes in this one). A solid script combined with great action make this film an outstanding one, and as for Christopher Nolan, he gives us another Oscar worthy flick, R.I.P. HEATH LEDGER.",10,6,13,19 July 2008
Drag Me to Hell," Good movie.
","***MINOR SPOILERS***Drag me to hell is one of the best horror/ thriller movies of the decade, as well as one of the best PG-13 thrillers ever made. Without exaggerating I jumped off my seat at least 15 times during this film. It is not just the fact that demons and ghosts are in the movie, but it is all about how Sam Raimi directed it. He refrained from presenting an overwhelming amount of blood and gore (come think of it this film didn't even have any blood and gore in it) and that is the beauty of Sam Raimi's direction. Unlike his previous entries such as Evil Dead 1&2 (filled with Zombies and violent and bloody scenes), Drag me to hell relies much on loud bangs and eerie musical scores that can make anyone jump off their seat at any given time. Although I've never heard of Lorna Raver before watching this film, her disturbing and creepy character kept giving me nightmares for a couple of days after watching the film. The plot of the film is also short and to the point There were as many characters as needed to be and all the actors played their roles perfectly. And not to mention the explosive ending I didn't see coming. This is the perfect horror film and I LOVED IT. I can't recommend it enough.",10,2,6,14 June 2009
The Descent," I have a zeal for horror flicks and this is a masterpiece.
","Wow what a great film, what is not to love about 'The Descent'. I can not even start talking about this masterful flick. Quite frankly I did not expect such a shocking cinema from U.K. But hey, apparently the British did not stop with 'Shaun of the dead'.The Descent is about a group of caving voyagers finding themselves trapped in a cave filled with human eating predators. There was a surplus of demonic creatures and gory fight scenes, which, by the way, I enjoyed. Great special effects and lengthy gruesome fights overwhelmed me throughout the movie. The plot, too, was exciting, I mean what would anyone do if they find themselves trapped in a cave full of flesh eating blind mutants with no way out?The other enjoyable aspect of the movie was its consistent suspenseful scenes. Unlike some painful-to-watch flicks in the same genre such as 'captivity' with Elisha Cuthbert, The Descent had me in a terrorizing yet overwhelmingly exuberant experience for an hour and a half.overall, if you are someone who is yet to see the movie and have claustrophobia do not watch it. but if you are man/woman enough to see a gory flick that will scare the crap out of you, well what are you waiting for? I guarantee you, you will love it.",9,1,3,25 December 2007
The Last King of Scotland," Historical and magnificent
","The Last King of Scotland is mainly about the notorious Ugandan leader Idi Amin but is told from the point of view of his physician. Both Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy are spectacular in this film. Especially Whitaker portrayed his role as a tyrant so brilliantly with his adapted accent and his overall appearance. James McAvoy, too, was awesome in this film as Dr. Garrigan. The film throughout has a dark and frightening tone which turned the movie from a boring drama to a suspenseful thriller and the actors were perfectly fit for their roles. Overall The Last King of Scotland is a well-acted and perfectly directed film, which also was a peek into a little history.",7,0,1,9 August 2008
Hancock," Doesn't live up to its hype.
","Hancock is a story of a superhero named John Hancock who has a hard time coping with his life and misuses his calling, while he happens to be a superhero who flies and has super-strength, we see him annihilating half LA whenever he does something heroic. Although the idea seemed interesting, we see the writers trapped in their own simplistic story with no where to go. The first half of the film is no where near perfect but is fairly interesting with amazing special effects and funny one-liners. But as the so called plot twist happens, the story diverts into this crazy pile of confusion. In addition to that I had to suffer Peter Berg's wacky way of directing. I am talking about the close-up shots. One or two is okay. But when it is in every other scene and it is so that I can count how many zits are on the characters faces, that becomes unbearable and annoying. I would be telling a lie if I said that Hancock is a wonderful film, it is fairly interesting, though I was expecting better from Will Smith.6.4/10",6,3,6,17 July 2008
Iron Man," Iron Man: Perfect everything, perfect cast, top notch visual effects, outstanding directing and solid script.
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***I just saw Iron Man in theaters with a friend. After a long wait I was able to see one of the few superhero movies that made it to the top 250 IMDb films of all time list. And that was what made me see the movie. It had an 8.3 user ratings and compared to other superhero movies, that's very high. The film was absolutely great. Let me start with the cast. Robert Downey Jr., who played Iron man/Tony Stark, is an Oscar nominated actor for the movie Chaplin back in 1992. Terrence Howard is a great actor who also was nominated for an academy award, so was Jeff Bridges, for 4 Oscars in fact. And who could forget the shining star of Shakespeare in Love, Gwyneth Paltrow, who walked home with an academy award for her lead role in the movie, Shakespeare in Love. The point I am trying to make is that the major stars of this movie have either won or been nominated for an academy award, which is what Terrence Howard stated when he was being interviewed for the movie premiere. The fact that Iron Man is filled with this talented cast made the movie huge before it even hit the theaters. And when it did hit the theaters the audience flew like a river to see what this cast has to deliver. My personal favorite character in the movie, though I don't want it to sound obvious, is Tony Stark. I liked him because he was witty and most of the time relaxed, even though he runs a huge company, and even though he is in a serious or tense situation he still manages to brighten his and his colleagues' day with humor. Especially there is this one scene where he shows up at a press conference with a cheese burger. The other cast members were also cool. Gwyneth Paltrow plays a convincing and attractive assistant of Tony Stark and Terrence Howard delivers a solid performance by playing Jim Rhodes, a guy in charge of the weaponry in the U.S. army. I also enjoyed Jeff Bridges' performance playing this seemingly nice guy who later turns out to be evil, though I did have a problem with that character, which I will discuss later. As far as the directing, Kudos Jon Favraeu. Perfect and consistent shots throughout the movie, unlike 'The Kingdom'(2007), where the camera was too close to the actors' faces that sometimes part of their faces was cut out. Not that I am saying The Kingdom was bad, I am just saying that there was something wrong with the cameraman. Alright back to Iron Man, Iron Man has stunning visuals. The visual effects supervisors should be really proud of themselves. All the scenes seemed so real that at some point I stopped believing that I was watching a movie and started thinking that this is some sort of documentary with real people in it doing real stuff. That's how much convincing the visuals were.Now I can tell you a movie that had fake and easily noticeable visuals, 'The Matrix Reloaded'(2003). Remember the scene were Neo was fighting the agents, and it was him by himself and the agents were exponentially increasing in number? Anybody who's not blind can tell That scene was totally made up of CGI shots, I noticed that the very first time I saw the movie, though I am not complaining about those CGI shots, I am just saying that They should have at least attempted to make it seem believable.I was watching the behind the scenes footage of Iron Man on TV Guide network the other day and Jon Favraeu was mentioning how they had to fight against nature to film the desert scenes, which proved to me the authenticity of the movie. All the scenes, as I mentioned in the previous paragraph, seemed so real, and I could not tell which scene was CGI and which wasn't. I loved every scene in the movie from beginning to the very end.Let me back away from all the positives of the movie and tell you the one negative thing that made me give the movie a 9/10 rating. The one thing I did not like about the movie is that Iron Monger/Obadiah Stone (played by Jeff Bridges) did not get enough time to display his evilness. There are only a few scenes were Mr. Stone is shown as the evil Iron Monger. Other than that for the most part, we only saw a friendly and nice Obadiah Stone that was Tony Stark's ally. Nevertheless, The fact that Jeff Bridges' evil character did not get enough screen time did not stop the movie from having a lot of action. Most of the action in the movie occurs in the second half of the movie, like most movies. And believe me, it has some good butt-kicking. Advanced weaponry that aren't seen anywhere else, voice activated robots, tactable holograms so on and so forth. Now, I've been hearing these rumors and have also seen on IMDb that there is going to be an Iron Man 2. You know what they say, sequels aren't as good as the first ones. Prove me wrong, Paramount, Marvel, Jon Favraeu and whoever else is going to be involved in the second movie. As to the first one, it was two hours of my life and the money paid to go see it well spent. I recommend this film to whoever wants to see an action-packed, comic book based, superhero movie.",9,1,2,17 May 2008
Easy A," Emma Stone is Hot. This movie is too.
","So i haven't done one of these in a really long time, but I just had to for this movie. Easy A is the most adorable and entertaining high school movie since Mean Girls. Everything about this movie is done to perfection. Emma Stone is as charming as ever. The Scarlet Letter based plot is effective. And the Juno-esque dialogues never fail to amuse.Easy A starts off as an average teen comedy with the protagonist and the best friend along with the obnoxious antagonist. But what makes this movie different from all the other mediocre films is its intelligent narration and its fast-paced yet deliberate story-telling. And unlike other teen comedies, Easy A doesn't just throw vulgar and clichéd jokes at you and expect you to laugh. Instead it is presented in a subtle and ironic manner.This film also contains many rich and relatable characters. To sum it all up, this is one of the best teen comedies of recent years.9/10",9,0,0,17 April 2011
The Simpsons Movie," 'awesome if you are not a simpsons fan.'
","I'm not a simpsons fan. and i decided to see the movie after a friend of mine told me about it. he told me that the movie is awesome for non-simpson fans, be he told me if you like the show you'll be somehow disappointed. so i gave it a shot. and yes it was amazing. it was a mindless comedy. it's mainly about the witty and mainly stupid homer polluting the town lake which causes Springfield, the simpsons' hometown, to be secluded from the rest of U.S.for a movie based off of a series, the simpsons movie is great. although I'm not a simpsons fan, i had the opportunity to see a couple of episodes. and the movie and the show basically have the same kind of humor, homer messes something up and he has to fix it. my advice for you movie goers is buy the DVD, it'll be a money well spent, and a good hour and a half.",7,1,1,15 March 2008
V for Vendetta," V for Vendetta...it didn't end with the matrix.
","Years after their biggest hit The Matrix, The Wachowski Brothers make a return with this masterpiece. Directed by a rather not-so-popular director James McTeigue, V for vendetta, portrays a single man's effort to battle the totalitarian government of his time. Combined with dazzling visuals, (those that resemble that of the matrix trilogy) V for vendetta portrays the theme of persistence and devotion throughout the film and does it extremely well. The actors, as well, play their roles so well that viewers might confuse the protagonist to the antagonist. We see this masked man in a killing spree. Yet his background leads us to sympathizing with him. And the dogma of the government makes even the cruelest and goriest measures taken by the masked rebel just.V for vendetta features two main characters by the names of V (Weaving) and Evey (Portman). V is the main protagonist, (or so he wants us to think so). He is the rebel who's battling the totalitarian government of Great Britain. His main goal is to overthrow the government, and to end the tyranny that has caused him to wear the Guy Fawkes mask. In doing so he needs an ally to help alongside. Than he meets Evey, a young woman whose family was devastated by the government, and has held a grudge ever since. The two spend time together, learning about one anotherand almost turning the rather violent film into a sweet romantic one.One aspect of the film that's consistent throughout is the devoted and determined persona of the protagonist. V, the main protagonist, seemed unrelenting in his efforts to achieve his goal. The idea of devotion is demonstrated throughout the film. However, devotion and consistency is not shown not only by V but also by those who want to see him dead, those that are after an invincible hero, and those that are after men pro-freedom and pro-individual rights.Another aspect of the film that would take viewers by awe is the spectacular special effects. The bloody and gory action scenes were incredibly perfect and the Wachowski brothers, even though they didn't direct the film, bring back the atmosphere they created in a movie they directed almost a decade ago, The Matrix. Every action scene in this film is overwhelmingly violent, and just as satisfying.Last but not least is the daunting performances of the main cast, starting from the dedicated fighter V played by Hugo Weaving, who rocks his role again, just as he did playing Agent Smith, and this time behind a mask. Natalie Portman also plays a character who is naïve, trustworthy, and has a miserable background. John Hurt also plays a wonderful role playing the extremely aristocratic leader Adam Sutler who would destroy anyone who would go against him.Overall, V for Vendetta remains to be one of the best of its kind, with a brief insertion of humor and lots of bloodshed and violence, combined with a strong message about commitment, friendship and the battle for freedom. Wachowski Brothers did it again.",9,2,5,7 November 2008
