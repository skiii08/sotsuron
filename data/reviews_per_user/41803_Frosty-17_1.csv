The Blair Witch Project," How to enjoy this movie:
","1. Don't believe the hype.  Try to lower your expectations to avoid disappointment.  The movie is very good, interesting, and creepy, but don't expect a masterpiece, no matter what you read.2. Sit at the back of the theatre!  It's true that the hand-held camera work can give you motion sickness.  I rarely have this problem, but I was nauseous by the end.  I think it's because I sat at the front of the theatre.  Oops!3. Try to see it at a time and place where there will be few teenagers.  My screening was ruined by giggling, chattering kids who were (loudly) disappointed by the absence of an ax-wielding maniac.",9,1,1,30 July 1999
