The Equalizer," Lengthy, Boring 'Old Ex-CIA agent' vs. Gangs movie.
","This is a movie in the fashion of Liam Neeson, Kevin Costner, Pierce Brosnan etc. recent movies, where a retired ex CIA agent 'with skills!' confronts and beats the hell out of some foreign criminals.The main problem with 'The Equalizer' is its length and rhythm. It lasts ...2 hours and 12 minutes and there isn't much happening in this movie to justify such a long duration. Compared to 'Taken' the action is minimal.Denzel Washington looks OK at his 60s but his presence and some pseudo-karate-spy moves aren't enough to fill the screen.The rhythm of the movie is terrible. From the beginning you expect to see the (obvious to come) action scenes but....it is taking too long and the scenes are forced and pretentious.The direction is poor, the cinematography unnecessary dark and the use of some super-slow-motion scenes near the end ridiculous and without the impact that the creators went for.There are TONS of clichés like 1 guy vs. 50, Rambo-like improvised traps, lots of 'Who are you?' from bad guys who are about to die and the infamous 'Cool Guys Don't Look At Explosions' scene.Chloë Grace Moretz is really good as the troubled Russian prostitute but her part is considerably small.It should be A LOT better but the creators were afraid to take any real chances.Overall: Don't be fooled by the star-status of Denzel Washington. This is a poor movie full of clichés that it would bore you by its length and poor execution.",Null,8,15,13 December 2014
Source Code," Good sci-fi thriller, totally ruined by its ridiculous 'Hollywood Happy' ending.
","This a very late review. I saw the movie back in 2011 and 2 other times since now in 2017.Generally is a good sci-fi thriller that for me is ruined by its preposterous ending.Mind though that the cinematic ending isn't the original. Hollywood producers insisted for a happy ending so they ruined the movie putting a ridiculous twist that simply doesn't make any sense.So, go and see it. Its production is good and there is the proper amount of suspense to make it interesting. I like Michelle Monaghan's performance in this, and Jeffrey Wright's up to a point, but Jake Gyllenhaal is looking to nervous in the lead.",Null,29,41,1 February 2017
John Wick," Eva Longoria presents...a popcorn movie with Keanu Reeves!
","The first 10 minutes of the movie are somehow misleading. You may think that you're watching a dark drama driven by revenge.Fortunately (more than unfortunately I guess) this is not the case. It is a pop movie made to please the audience in a tongue-in-chick manner. You enter the world of mobsters and payed assassins where everyone is known, everyone goes to the same place for entertainment, follows rules and is slick and understanding! Like ...Cheers, where everybody knows your name! So this isn't a movie to be taken seriously. It's just for fun. And after numerous killings, lame martial arts moves and macho one liners... you get exactly that.All the clichés you know well from thousands other movies are here too. The villain (so to speak because everyone is a villain) instead of killing his captured victim right away and solve all of his problems in an instant, starts blubbering philosophical BS and chooses an unconventional way to kill him (instead of let's say a bullet in the head).So is that kind of the movie.Is it entertaining? Well yes. I think so. I wasn't bored for the most part. I learn quickly to ignore the plot holes and just tried to enjoy it.Overall: It's a popcorn movie, so go get your popcorn! P.S. Fun fact: Eva Longoria is one of the producers!",Null,3,12,19 January 2015
Fury," A very good Anti-War drama...
","The way I see it there are 2 types of 'war movies': The first type aims, if not to glorify war (that it would be plain stupid) at least to inspire and promote an heroic behavior that leads to a stellar victory where the 'good guys' prevail over the (often faceless) bad guys, like Top Gun or Rambo.The second type of war movies though, despite any heroic achievements, has a more than clear Anti-War message. You she clearly people suffer, even the ones who are victorious. You see people fear. The cruel face of War.Without a doubt Fury is in the second (and more preferable) category.Fury is an Anti-War movie where the audience can see how people, even regular, good people could be transformed in a time of war. You get tougher in a bad way. You struggle to maintain your humanity...A substantial part of Fury happens inside a tank and that claustrophobic feeling adds to the terror.The acting is very good, but praises need to be addressed to the cinematography (as a bonus notice the 'color coded' firing effect) and the direction.Overall: A sophisticated approach to the genre of war movies. Recommended..",Null,0,5,11 February 2015
Fight Club," Impossible premise makes a Pop movie for young male adults!
","First rule (and second too) of the Fight Club is 'You do not talk about Fight Club'! Well...hm...yeah, but the Fight Clubs keeps getting bigger and bigger! So how this can be possible???Anyway that's just one of the B.S. that this movie feeds you, from the beginning to the end. And there are countless!!When you know the 'surprise' ending and try watching the movie again to see if any details in some scenes can give it away, you end-up empty handed! The movie does not take care this aspect of the plot at all.****ENDING SPOILER STARTS: For example Norton's alter-ego Pitt takes a serious beating and his face is totally messed up. Next day though Norton went to his job to see his boss and his face is perfectly OK before he pretends to take another beating in his boss's office. If Norton/Pitt took the beating the day before and went to his boss already beat up, his little trick wouldn't do him any good. ****ENDING SPOILER ENDS****My point is, that this movie is not well thought, like, for example, 6th sense ,where the ending is in accordance with all the scenes previously seen in the movie.But, if not to take it seriously, this movie is fun somehow, and pop. Addressed obviously to young males.Overall: Stick it to the man!",Null,0,1,24 October 2014
The Maze Runner," An action movie, for teenagers only...
","Be warned! I saw 'The Maze Runner' without really caring about it. I'm not in its demographics. I can't think anyone over 20-ish to want to see this movie. It's intended for teenagers! It's a movie in the same fashion like Hunger games (that I also didn't care to follow). In a dystopian future some kids are trapped inside a maze, without any recollection of how they end up there. Some of them feel that the right thing to do is stay inside and survive, some others want to get out.Right from the start it reminded me of the RPG game 'Gothic' (2001). That game too starts with an elevator of some sort carrying supplies to the inhabitants of the maze (barrier in the game) and is also the mean that the main hero arrives inside.The themes of 'The Maze Runner' you have seen it before (if you are older than 20-ish!) many many times.It has a creepy, mysterious atmosphere, basically because of the design of the maze with its ultra-tall walls but that isn't enough. The rest of the 'universe' the movie tries to build seems incomplete and fails to capture the imagination of the viewer.Overall the movie feels like a product to make money. (And as far as I know it did. Making more than 10 times the money that cost.) It follows a recipe, and if you 'ate' a lot of those (i.e. you are more mature and have seen many movies) you reach a point that you want more.",Null,0,2,30 November 2014
Argo," Well...this is Hollywood...Based on actual events that ...never happened.
","If you are aware about the Iran hostage crisis (1979–1981) and you want to have some insight about the famous rescue of the six U.S. diplomats from Tehran also known as the 'Canadian Caper'...well...just don't watch this movie!!!Supposedly based on the actual events of that mission, this movie is as fictional as could possibly be. So many inaccuracies and exaggerations, not to mention the casting of Ben Affleck as the of -Mexican-descent Tony Mendez.All the drama, all the tense and scary situations...well...never really happened!!!So, is this a problem? Well, no. It didn't bother me until after the end of the movie where the producers decided to present them as such. So many movies are stating 'Based on actual events but the names have been changed'...well...this is a movie that the names are kept intact and the events were heavily distorted for dramatic purposes.But that's the magic of Hollywood. The exaggeration. The building of climax. The fun. And this movie succeeds in all of those.The acting is good. As far as I know everyone liked Alan Arkin's performance in particular. The suspenseful scenes are efficient, especially for people from N. America or Europe who are somehow scared of the Middle East...and there lots of angry Muslims in this movie.Overall: The movie won Oscars and it was a commercial success. For me I would give it a 7/10 in terms of entertainment. Yet, I cannot endorse the exploitation of the actual events. In the end this movie is as fictitious as Rambo was for the Vietnam war. Otherwise it is fun, and check it out...",Null,2,5,9 August 2016
Point Break," Nothing to do with the Original. Greenish oversharp Cinematography ruins the landscapes.
","Either you make a sequel or a remake it is inevitable to compare it with the original. All too often a remake has nothing to do with the original except maybe the names of the characters involved.Pretty much this is the case of Point Break (2015).The 'original' Point Break was a multilayer action movie. The romantic element was stronger, its purpose more clear, the fine line a deep undercover agent could cross and lose himself more evident and, because that matters the most in this cases, more fun.In the 'contemporary' version you are going to see some wild landscapes, including Angel Falls in Venezuela, Caineville in Utah and the Swiss Alps missing in the original. Yet the greenish over-sharped image, chosen by Ericson Core who serves both as the director and as cinematographer, dilutes their majestic natural appearance and makes them look artificial.The movie also talks, in the beginning, about nirvana and spiritual enlightenment but in the end fails to emit such feelings towards the viewers.So is it bad? Well no I wouldn't say that. it us a totally different beast. More raw, even more dramatic but with far less wit and charisma.The cast isn't stellar. I wouldn't compare Ray Winstone with the ...shadow of the tongue-in-chic Pappas (Gary Busey) of the first installment. Neither Teresa Palmer is the smart-mouthed Lori Petty. All the characters are pretty much wooden and one dimensional.Overall: I would say to check it out for the impressive stunts and landscapes, but the sharp and green cinematography ruined that for me. No real substance in the fun department or the performances either.",Null,2,2,13 March 2016
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," A classic chick flick for...well..chicks.
","Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey are paired by Hollywood to star in a few movies as modern couple. There is some chemistry between them but not so much as the producers might wish for.Anyway, this is romantic comedy with a ridiculous premise to justify the weird situations and gags you will experience by seeing it. Obviously the movie being romantic and having jokes of this specific kind is designed to have an appeal in women. I honestly can't expect a group of guys for example, watching such a silly movie.And yes. It is silly. But not necessarily in a bad way. The production is good, the music old time romantic and the whole set-up is build like a fairy tale. Some light drama and a predicable outcome.",Null,0,0,13 February 2016
Constantine," Nice supernatural horror thriller. Doesn't matter if you haven't read the comics!
","This is a nice supernatural horror thriller on its own.You don't have to know the comic Hellblazer on which is based.Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz and Tilda Swinton are looking good for the main roles. Shia LaBeouf, as the after-teenage age sidekick is good too (these roles are more suitable for him and certainly not of a leading man).There are some plot holes and inconsistencies, but the flow of the movie is suspenseful enough to keep you interested. The visuals are OK and you can expect a couple of disgusting scenes.Overall: It's an entertaining movie nevertheless. Stay for an after credits secret scene too!",Null,1,2,31 October 2014
Spotlight," What puzzles me with the Oscars...
","By no means movies awarded the best movie academy award are the best out there. That's for sure. Neither Miss Universe is the 'most beautiful woman in the world' etc.I will probably fail to remember which movies won the Oscar the last 3 decades. Some of them are totally forgettable and makes you wonder if they were deserving a nomination in the first place. In my opinion 'the best picture of the year' should be a game changing movie, that leaves you speechless while you are watching it and make a permanent imprint in your mind and soul.Spotlight won the Oscar for the best movie of 2016. Was it worth it? In my opinion faaaar from it. Was it a bad movie? Of course not. But it is far from being great. It has adequate performances from the well known leads. A bright photography, which for me is always a plus, but...Of course the premise touches a sensitive subject but it doesn't make an impact to the audience. You will hear: the number is not 13 it's more than that like 20 or even 90, and that is supposed to have an impact to the viewers, about the scale of child molestation from priests and a possible church cover-up, but it really hasn't. You hear 2-3 testimonies but you don't see the act, not even in the form of a flashback. So, for that, it is not effective.I read some reviews praising how 'controlled' this movie is. In my opinion that was a mistake for that subject. The testimonies weren't enough to draw a picture about the problem. Also there is no actual heroes here. The reporters just doing their work and the paper had the opportunity to do something years ago but let it slide.Overall: I cannot understand how this movie is considered as the best of 2016. It is a mild ride. No surprises no heroes. A little bit on the boring side in its 2 hours 7 minutes duration. Nothing extraordinary. Just adequate as a film and far less than that as a statement against a serious problem of our societies.",Null,18,40,8 April 2016

Spider-Man: Homecoming," More like a Spider-man SPOOF.
","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that 'goofy' version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...",Null,127,228,27 September 2017

They decide to do something about them and all hell breaks loose.The script is well-developed. The jokes are impossible but funny nevertheless.The actors are funny and serious at the same time.

Interstellar," There is NO WAY in Hell this is a TOP #20 movie of all time
","OK. I understand that the Nolan brothers have a fan base because of the Batman movies or whatever but there is no way in Hell this is among the best movies of all time.First of all it is lengthy without variety (thus boring), and unnecessary melodramatic. The last 20' (out of 170') where the resolution of any 'mystery' is residing are somehow rewarding but the movie tires its audience long before that.I would like to compare it with Carl Sagan's (check my avatar) Contact (1997) which more than 15 years earlier managed to make a movie faaaar more interesting, and with deeper meanings.The Nolan brothers only went for cheap father(s)/daughter(s) dramas, just to embellish some scientific theories that may or may not be true after all.You see... Despite the facts that this movie advertised as 'more truthful to the current scientific theories, it is pure fiction whatsoever.Overall: If you are a fan of the genre you most definitely will check it out no matter what, so....",Null,8,15,25 January 2015

Asked one of my favorite movies, perhaps the most beloved.Not because I laughed with smart funny scenes, but because 'he spoke' for all truly beautiful feelings. Love, friendship, faith, patience, sincerity, selflessness, kindness, generosity, hope. But for children traumatized souls, or how to squander our lives on meaningless things and pleasures and lose the chance to be close to those who love us really.Maybe I liked the script because it was a movie different from all the others and still is.

The Matrix Revolutions," The conclusion of a Trilogy that might have been a Masterpiece.
","The creators of The Matrix Trilogy had repeatedly state that this was conceived as a 'Trilogy' from the start.Despite the increase of the available resources (money, artistic freedom etc.) the 2nd matrix is got lost in its own ingredients, so it was up to the 3rd to save the day.About the ending that of course I wont spoil you, it was a big decision and a risk for the directors to take such approach. The movie is the darkest of the 3. It is emotional and the prevalent emotion is that of the lost hope.I have seen many times the first Matrix but far less the 2nd and even fewer the 3rd. I know the first by heart, by I don't really remember the biggest part of the 3rd. Sure I remember the basic plot, but the movie needed soooo much more to be remembered and a worthy sequel.For me you have 2 choices. You even watch the whole trilogy one movie after the other until the end OR stay with the satisfying feeling the first one leaves and watch just that.",Null,2,3,5 October 2014
Man of Steel," Another adaptation for the well know superhero....
","There are numerous adaptations for the myth of Superman on TV and that myth is distorted beyond recognition from the original material. Man of steel has a strong resemblance with Reeve's Superman 2. Super-villains from the planet Krypton were after Cal-El in a battle taking place on planet Earth.There are some new additions to the story but the basic elements are all there. The new additions that I won't spoil right now, might annoy the hardcore fans of the kryptonian hero.The movie has the latest in visual fx, but some scenes are looking better than others that appear less convincing. The script isn't good though and most of the dialogs are poor. The casting is the thing that ruins the movie most. Amy Adams is a bad choice to play the iconic Lois Lane. Russel Crow and Kevin Costner might want to change roles in the movie. It wouldn't make any difference.The music of the veteran H. Zimmer is sub-par but I wan't expecting someone to surpass one of the most recognizable music themes in movie history.Overall. Of course no one will miss seeing that version of Superman too. So...what are you waiting for? You won't be heavily disappointed but any positive impression it will fade quickly.",Null,3,6,14 October 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Far LESS entertaining than M.I.4 (Ghost protocol)
","I wont bother you with the plot of M.I.5. It is the usual spy stuff. Some 'list' in a USB stick. Your own agency against you etc. etc.To tell you the truth I couldn't distinguish the premise from that of a 007 movie.Anyway. It is a movie so the question is how much entertainment you get from watching it. Well...not that much. Although the 2011 MI4 was a great movie in terms of action and fun (Best of all MI movies) this one is ...meh. Too much of the usual car chases and countdowns and retina scans etc. that fail to keep you interested.The leading lady is also boring and uncharismatic (for this particular part at least). Cruise is looking tired, and the rest of cast has a minor involvement in the plot. The 'bad guy' is also ...meh. Where is Telly Savalas and Michael Lonsdale?? Some of the stunts claimed to be real, but they are nothing compare to the scenes at Burj Khalifa of MI4. I remember enjoying the opening sequence of MI4 in a soviet prison and some funny and thrilling scenes at the Kremlin. Unfortunately, No such fun sequences in MI5.Overall: a mediocre film of the genre (and maybe I am too generous) .",Null,15,30,14 August 2015
Batman Begins," Overrated
","Overrated movie with lots of fans.The Batman story doesn't actually reinvents itself with this one. Like almost every superhero movie of the last 2 decades, this is also a dark movie and not because of its Dark Knight Character.Still its a better approach than the ridiculously flamboyant version of the past starring ...Clooney or Kilmer, but for me isn't something to write home about it.The visual are mediocre, even unattractive like some horror effects with some guys wearing a mask.I didn't like it much. I've seen it here and there (catch it on television) 3-4 times. Didn't grow on me. The 2nd and the 3rd are better, but I guess for someone who hasn't see them and wishes to have a little marathon this one is the one which you should start.Zimmer's music is also bad.

Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A nearly perfect action movie...
","Well, what the hell. I'll give this a 10. Obviously it's not a masterpiece that belongs to the top of Movie classics but as an entertaining action movie is top notch.M.I. 1 was terrible despite a couple of scenes that became iconic. John Woo failed as the director of M.I.2.M.I.3 was better mainly because of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman who made a great villain, but still...This one is by far the best (breaking the curse of sequels) and it's more than obvious that first timer director (with actors at least) Brad Bird had only one purpose in his mind: To please the audience.Tom Cruise is GREAT. Many of his stunts were performed by him. Most notable the scenes at Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world at Dubai. Simon Pegg seems like a good addition and a comic relief to the action.I admire the direction, plus its collaboration with the editing and the music. All the ingredients melted together nicely.Almost every scene is fun. Carefully designed to please and entertain.

Gone Girl," Good thriller. Not a #250 Best, but interesting nevertheless.
","I'm always skeptical about movies that last more than 2 hours. If it's not a blockbuster kind of film, the chances are that it will be boring. I saw yesterday 'The equalizer' with Denzel Washington (2:12 duration) and it was boring as hell.Surprisingly enough 'Gone Girl' in its almost 2 and a half hours it's far from boring. I dare to say that it was really interesting until the end, and that says a lot.So if you want my quick recommendation: Go see it.I'm not a Ben Affleck fan but he is good in this. In my opinion he is no cut to play heroes. He is more like a regular Joe, with human weaknesses, so this role suits him. Rosamund Pike looks crazy enough, 'trapped in her own world' so she's a good cast too. Same goes with the rest of the cast with the exception maybe of Neil Patrick Harris.The direction is not boring and keep you interested through its whole length. Some randomly added flashbacks help the narration, and are not confusing as in some other films.The atmosphere of the movie is great. It's a thriller that it can go both ways (and maybe even follow a ...third option).The music score is more like a music pad of electronic music (made by synthesizers and not an orchestra), and it is present all the time adding to the mystery.The movie it's not only about thrills. There is some substance too. About marriages, about expectations, about the world of electronic media, about how your public image can affect your life nowadays.Oh. And you get to see a glimpse of Affleck's 'average' member (if you care, which I seriously doubt) in a shower scene, obviously made as a publicity stunt.

22 Jump Street," 22 Sesame street = Just for kids + some balls/dick/gay jokes
","This is not a comedy. It's more like this:First half seems like a farce, but it's watchable if you aren't too demanding.Second half is totally ridiculous, with surreal, boring, lengthy jokes that no one in sane mind (or above the age of 8) could possibly find even remotely funny.For example:*ENDING SPOILER ALERT* In one of the last scenes the girl who is also the drug lord mastermind villain in this, after a boring shootout where 'no one is getting shot' as the same girl points out in the movie, ends up with Jonah Hill's character ready to brawl. For 3 minutes you can see them argue and trying ...to kiss one another. (What????) 'you tried first', 'No, you had the kissy eyes' and then exchange a few punches.The movie isn't funny and targets an audience with a 'whazup' state of mind, who pretends to laugh loudly when a 'balls' or 'dick' joke comes around.Hill and Tatum aren't funny. Neither by themselves, neither as a comedy duo.This movie cost ...$65 mil. According to wikipedia. The same budget as ...The Matrix! I wonder where all these money went. The most expensive scene seems to be a Humvee crashing some bikes in a college campus.Anyway. The main goal for the producers (Hill & Tatum again) is accomplished since that movie has a gross of $330 mill (dear God!) already, and soon the DVD and BluRay are coming out.And guess what.

I would probably call 'Amadeus' as one of the best i've seen and one of the best movies of all time.The fact that it won 8 Oscars is an indication for the quality you can expect.Best picture, screenplay, direction, costumes, some of the best music ever composed, marvelous performances.... A true masterpiece.The story follows the apocryphal legend that Antonio Salieri was responsible for the death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart out of jealousy over the latter's music. (As far as I know, even the descendants of Mozart are considering this as fiction.)There is no excuse not to see this movie. Even if you think that classical music isn't your thing or you don't care about an 18th century drama, the movie is so emotional and at the same time enjoyable and entertaining that it will win your heart and soul.The movie has so many memorable scenes that if you own a hard copy, you might find yourself watch them again and again.Overall: One of the best movies ever made, and it has the awards to prove it.",Null,2,3,8 October 2014

Nicolas Cage plays her father and looks and acts ridiculous even in some really disturbing scenes.This movie has a rather unique visual style. Unevenly Joyful to much the extremely bloody violence. In some fighting scenes looks like a multicolor version of the Matrix.The music and songs aren't always suitable but it seems like the director chose this tongue-in-chick approach to remind you that this is nothing more than plain entertainment.Overall: If you don't mind the gruesome violence and you have strong suspension of disbelief, check it out.",Null,9,14,13 February 2016

The android fools the visitor so she can kill her creator, trap the visitor, and free herself to see the world and satisfy her curiosity about humans.OK. That's about it, plus some nudity, and a dance.I couldn't find a deeper meaning to all this. There are more philosophical meanings in The Matrix (1999) and even Chappie (2015).The movie progresses really slow, and the electronic ambient music makes it feel even slower. The whole plot is what I wrote in a previous paragraph.Seems like an old trend is coming back. Sentient machines. This time they don't want to kill all the humans like in Terminator or the Matrix (although they will kill someone without remorse if it fits their plans, like in this).

Pawn Sacrifice," Interesting movie with a solid performance from Tobey Maguire
","I think I have seen a few movies about chess and like in all movies concerning competitive sports I know that it could be very interesting and inspiring. So don't assume that this is a boring movie because of its theme.This is based on the real life of chess legend Bobby Fischer who after he became world champion, he lived a secluded, solitary life possibly because of a mental illness which made him paranoid.I am not a fan of Tobey Maguire (poor choice for Spiderman IMO) but he gives a convincing performance in this. His tantrums and his stares as he is building irrational thoughts about conspiracies and imaginable dangers are s strong plus to the film.The pace of the film is also good and the music by the veteran James Newton Howard follows the emotions with grace.Overall: Recommended",Null,47,60,16 December 2015
The Imitation Game," That guy he really have seen every humiliation possible.
","This is a biopic about British mathematician Alan Turing who cracked Nazi's code (Enigma) which helped the Allies win WWII.Alan Turing he may played a crucial role affecting the fate of millions but overall he was a tragic figure. Throughout his (short) life he experienced every humiliation possible because of his strange personality who made people to hate him and later his homosexuality which was considered a criminal act in the UK back in the 1950s.This movie does a good job on making you feeling sorry for him.Benedict Cumberbatch with his unusual facial features brings the character to life effectively. This is not a 'Sherlock' movie. The character emits an 'autistic' quality. Good with numbers and codes but annoying and without social skills.As I'm reading this movie takes a lot of liberties. Many aspects of the film are not true, like his special relationship with Joan Clarke (played by Keira Knightley, who by the way is nothing like the actual person according to her niece in terms of looks and personality).It seems like the producers went for 'That guy saved the world and protected the modern way of life AND ...invented the computers, and the society humiliated him, poisoned him and pushed him to commit suicide.' So its a movie that leaves a bitter feeling at the end.Overall it's a good movie, certainly not worthy to be at top250 as it is now or a 'Masterpiece', and Cumberbatch's performance is good and not 'Epic'. If you catch it somewhere, check it out.",Null,4,11,19 January 2015
Jurassic World," A good fun movie
","Well. I'm not expecting anyone to be reading this after 900 reviews at IMDb, so I'm gonna be a little loose.I remember Jurassic Park but I wasn't a big fan. I think I saw the other 2 movies but I only remember from the a somehow likable character to say to a velociraptor 'Clever girl' just before he was brutally murdered.Anyway, even if you haven't seen JP I suggest to see JW.It is a fun, interesting movie. It has its thrilling moments, overall good visuals and good music from John Williams (yes, they kept his original theme).From casting and acting there are lots of things to be desired though. Especially the comedians Jake Johnson, in a semi-significant role and Lauren Lapkus should most definitely have to be recasted.It's the 5th most profitable movie of all time, so... it doesn't matter what the critics say.

Logan," The first dramatic movie the SuperHero Kids have seen.

Are these written from kids and teenagers who only have seen Xmen and Captain America films? This is most definitely NOT a Superhero movie. You could easily cut out the 'Comics' part, which by the way Logan himself states that are B.S., and have a thriller in the Mexico and U.S. countryside, with some elements of a road movie.The fans must have not seen other movies. Honestly. The director changes the mood and feel to something that belongs to another genre, without being original for that particular genre, preserving basically the names of the now elderly X-men and produces an otherwise unremarkable movie.I write these comments spoiler-free, but the ending has a serious impact to the whole mythology.In my opinion Superhero movies must stick to their original virtues so can fans to see what they are expecting to see, and leave the unnecessary darkly humane elements for other genres..",Null,1,9,14 April 2017

La La Land," Overrated. Sub-par music. Depressing Ending.
","This movie won awards and praised by some, so the chances are that you are going to see it eventually...As a musical it lacks good music and good choreography. It draws inspiration by classics like Singing in the rain and West Side Story but it can't compete with any of these masterpieces and it doesn't offer anything new in the genre.In terms of acting Emma Stone is very good, showing seamless transitions between opposite emotions but nothing special from Ryan Gosling who adds to the sad tone that the movie will eventually reach.The plot it starts as a satire of todays (and past and maybe future) Los Angeles, which is full of waitresses who want to be famous actresses and struggling musicians who have their own dreams to make it in a very competitive world.Later it becomes a romantic story (not only for relationships but also for dreams and wishes) but in its final act the movie takes a serious dramatic turn where the two 'happy' endings are combining to a depressing conclusion, that even the final two reassuring nods can't repair. Add to this an alternate timeline flashback that the director/writer wanted to incorporate to his vision, and you end up with an overall depressing movie that actually ruins the optimistic feeling and the romance that initially had.Overall: Depressing. Mediocre forgettable music. A classic story that ends up in a melancholic, yet pragmatical, way..",Null,109,217,17 April 2017
The Matrix Reloaded," Trapped in the curse of Sequels!
","The creators of The Matrix Trilogy had repeatedly state that this was conceived as a 'Trilogy' from the start. Although I haven't a reason to doubt that, the 2nd (and 3rd) Matrix fall in the tradition that many sequels of good movies suffer from.Despite the fact that practically the same cast and crew who created the magnificent first part is here for the 2 & 3 (they shot it back-to-back) the movie quickly loses its spirit.First mistake is the introduction of many many new secondary characters who might not necessarily needed. And these characters are trying really hard to pose as important without that being the case at all.Second mistake is the forced philosophy that didn't actually had anything to add to that of the original. The attempt for a recreation of the perfectly scripted dialog between Neo and the Oracle in the original is a failed one. For some, including me, it even destroys the feeling of the original dialog by diminishing its great themes.Third mistake the (experimental) visual effects this time look completely fake. There is a big fight, shot with something that is described as virtual cinematography, and it's more than obvious that...well..it needs lots of work to be believable.In conclusion when you are trying for bigger and better there is no guaranty that you will succeed. A common thing in movie sequels. A curse, that struck the second (and the third) sequels of the Matrix.",Null,26,39,5 October 2014
Steve Jobs," Another depiction of the life of Steve Jobs.
","Another depiction of the life of the late founder of Apple inc. Steve Jobs. Honestly I've lost count how many actors have played him. Ashton Kutcher, Justin Long, Noah Wyle... and now Michael Fassbender.Michael Fassbender's physical appearance and way of acting was clearly a very bad choice. Made Jobs look like ...Magneto who was in a mission against humanity. I read that Fassbender called Christian Bale and ask him why isn't he who played Jobs in his place. Far better choice if you ask me...In the script (written by Aaron Sorkin) Steve Wozniak (played by Josh Gad, ooops sorry Seth Rogen ! so many depictions of Woz too) asks Jobs rhetorically: You are not a programmer, you are not an engineer, you are not a designer yet everyone says you are a genius. What exactly do you do? Well, to answer the question he was the front man, the rock star. He sells (or something) to Apple fans everywhere. That's the obvious reason for the existence of this movie too.In this version Jobs is more easily to hate. He is mean to everyone. Mean to his daughter and her mother, mean to technicians, a liar and a cheater who prefers to deceive the public that the Macintosh can speak. A terrible person.The film is divided into three acts set in the lead-up to key product launches. I didn't like Danny Boyle's direction at all.I doubt that people (especially out of the U.S.) will care much about this film. And maybe they shouldn't. The picture hasn't got much to offer to people who are out of the technology world.For a more sold depiction of that era where the personal computers were born and for a broader look of that world, I suggest seek for the TV movie 'Pirates of Silicon Valley (1999)'.

The movie doesn't take itself too serious and that's a good thing, so you can expect some funny moments too.Surprisingly enough there is also a romance in it. And I mean it is a surprise because Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are far from a matching couple. There is no romantic chemistry between them as simple as that.Anyway. Overall it's a fun movie.

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Effort for technical originality and a couple of strong performances aren't enough.
","There are many ways to make your movie different from the others and one of them is by attempting an achievement in the technical department. The director of Birdman made the conscious choice to shoot his whole movie like it is one continuous long take (with an exception near the end).Well, stunts like that sometimes work, sometimes don't, and in my opinion Birdman is closer to the latter.It should be better, in my opinion, if it was filmed in a more traditional way. It might not had the spotlight as a technical achievement but I think it would be far more efficient and far more entertaining. The director tied his own hands. He deprived some pretty powerful creative tools, in an effort to be different.The plot is OK. A delusional, washed-up Hollywood actor famous for playing a superhero (Birdman) in blockbuster movies decades earlier, tries his luck as a performer and a director on a Broadway theater. The other characters in the film his colleagues, his ex-wife, his daughter, are more like secondary characters who serve his story, without actually complete a sub-plot on their own.Michael Keaton is OK too. I hear about an Oscar nomination (he got a Golden Globe already). Well, people have won Oscars for less.The film is actual a dramedy, and there is a really funny scene outside of the theater (that the film mostly takes place), which might actually reward you if till that time you thought the film was boring.So. Is it worth watching? Hm, yes. Why not.Is it a 'masterpiece' like I'm reading from some hasty or biased fans? Well No. Far from it. I use the 'M'-word (as someone said it) for movies like 'Amadeus (1984)' and above.You probably won't remember 'Birdman' next year.",Null,34,73,18 January 2015
The Big Short," Informative and somehow interesting...
","First of all don't be fooled by other reviews. This movie is neither a crap nor a masterpiece.It has a lot of technical terms and jargon from the world of economics and despite the obvious effort to explain things (including breaking the 4th wall (i.e. talking direct to the audience while looking into the camera), and cameo appearances from movies stars like Margot Robbie and Selina Gomez) you will probably fail to understand in depth the mechanics of what is happening.The world of banks, funds, bonds, financing and the stock market will remain a mystery for most of the viewers.Big names of Hollywood star in the Big Short including Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and others. They play real persons, who had an insight on the global economic crisis we probably still experiencing.As a movie it has its own style. Something of a documentary, a comedy sometimes, but essentially a drama since the crisis cost 8 million people their job and their homes.People who are impressed easily might tell you this is a 'masterpiece'. Believe me it isn't. But I recommend to see it. Even better at home where you can pause or rewind the movie to understand better. It is lengthy (130min) but you won't get bored. It needs some patience though especially in the beginning and not to be disappointed when terms like CDO, payouts etc. are starting to emerge.",Null,107,165,16 January 2016

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Incoherent....
","BvS with its superficially seriousness, made more apparent the ludicrous nature of Superhero comics in general. Don't get me wrong. I like (liked) comics like the next person, but when you read or watch Superman you must feel a tongue sentiment. I didn't felt that. Instead I felt cheated from this movie.The editing is incoherent and involves dream sequences, unneeded use of slow motion and flashbacks. The direction is blunt and the pace boring. I started to taking note for this review 1h:30' into the movie and still it hasn't build-up. The basic premise 'Batman sees Superman as a threat' is OK but the script and the dialogs look hasty written.Despite the a quarter of a billion dollars budget, the movie still uses the TV-based 'air fan in the hair and face trick' to Lois, to skip the cost of a CGI Superman fly. To tell you the truth I wonder where that money went since the movie doesn't excel in the visuals department. Just rewatched Terminator 3, a misunderstood movie if you ask me, and the big budget was evident in props, stages and cgi. BvS looks like they heavily misused the money.The cast, same as MoS, doesn't seem appropriate in this movie too. About Affleck I would agree he was a poor choice but overall didn't bother as other Batmen in the past. Gal Gadot looks nice in the WW suit though.Another problem is with the Music. Seems unsuitable. And I'm not talking about Superman's (??) theme which is a joke (the first appearance of S. in the movie uses Zimmer's theme like it is suppose to be a well known litemotif and fails miserably), but also the 'functional' music in almost every scene. It also bothered me the rip-off Mozart's requiem-like theme that used in some supposedly dramatic scenes. Sounded really out of place too. *sigh* For me John William's iconic Superman theme(s) will be always my favorite by far.Overall: 'You got me? Who's got you?' Lois Lane said in Donner's Superman in the original scene which this movie tried to copy or remind. The thing is that we never forgot that line and Amy Adams's 'You came back' is as forgettable as it should be. S I and S II despite the many arbitrary elements and b-class effects were touching and noble and fun. I don't like Zack Scnyder's vision at all. He did an excellent job in '300' but after that... BvS falls in that category. Superheroes are like the goose with the golden eggs nowadays, so this movie will be successful too. Financially. Artistically no. I have already forgot about it. I will always remember S I and II, though.",Null,18,41,30 March 2016

What amazed me the most was the solid rhythm of the movie. In its 2 hours the director and the editor managed to achieve a pace that fits the mood of the plot and balances between action and sentiment. This film is not forcefully complicated and that's a good thing.I wont bother you with comments about the visual fx etc. which obviously were great with such a budget.The problem of 'Part 2' is that you probably have to see the previous movies especially the 7th to understand the mechanics of what is happening. The film is generous about sharing information but although a very good movie you simply can't see it independently from the others.Overall: Excellent proper rhythm and atmoshere but you must have seen the previous movies and know well Harry Pooter's Universe to truly enjoy it.",Null,0,2,29 December 2015

Kingsman: The Secret Service," Fun action comedy with a couple of grizzly scenes and a Colin Firth full of style and finesse.
","(I don't expect anyone is reading this, since this is the ...426th review posted, but here goes!) This is an over-the-top action movie build on the British style of Roger Moore's 007 and the 'The Avengers' (TV Series 1961–1969).I can think a couple of actors who might be suitable for the main role but the finesse and elegance of Colin Firth is beyond any criticism and the main reason to see this movie. You might never believed that Firth could pose as an action hero but in the league of 55-65 spy-type assassins gives ...Liam Neeson a run for his money.The direction is stylish too and its main purpose to please the audience. Lots of slo-mo effects, one-vs-100 fighting sequences, sky diving, many many explosions etc. Not the boring type. This movie has good action choreography that becomes even more fun when you see Colin Firth delivering it! The script is overall clever although the premise is common. The wealthy evil mastermind vs. 'a' British secret service (not MI6), but even that idea has held some sarcasm for itself.With the exception of a couple scenes near the end that are crossing the line to the ridiculous this movie has some emotions too.Overall: Recommended",Null,3,8,9 May 2015

Likable actor, good in the matrix, and a modest person in real life as I'm reading. Yet ...he doesn't look like the ...bogeyman. I can accept a middle-age Steven Segal as the glimmer man, but I just don't see Keanu like that.And in the (two) movies his skills aren't so great. Doesn't seem like a meticulous professional.

I thought counting bullets was a must skill for professional killers...As a movie is full of clichÃ©s. Another 'secret' society of killers, with 'rules' (meant to be broken) and pseudo-wise characters willing to share their ridiculous wisdom with others. Not to mention the ancient movie tradition where the evil guy doesn't kill the hero when he has the chance, but instead ties him in ...a chair ...in an old warehouse making it so easy for him to escape, while explaining his evil plans.Yet it seems that the movie has a small but loyal audience. The stuntman director tries to capture some brutal violent moves up close. Long sequences of Reeves shooting foes at point blank is somehow a new trend.Overall: The otherwise sympathetic Keanu Reeves seems miscasted here.

Spectre," Mediocre and overbudgeted !
","Despite an initial action scene full of CGI that you can also experience in the trailer, this movie hasn't got too much to offer.The main problem is the bad script and dialogs and the pretentious style which tries to keep the tradition of older Bond films incorporating some not-so-witty and cliché humor and ludicrous action sequences with nothing new to offer. Planes, helicopters, cars...Well we've seen it all before and in much better executions.Also Blofeld (or should I say BLOWfeld), despite the fact he is the King of all previous villains, seems quite harmless.Casino Royale (2006) is far more entertaining (I've watched it again recently) and engaging. Spectre is 'Meh!' in almost every department including (unfortunately) the ladies.Thomas Newman who serves as the composer of the film, is proved to be a bad decision too. At the beginning he tries to revive the good-old 007 theme in almost every scene and the outcome is sub-par to say the least. Later he replaces the music with the same note again and again (da-da-da-da-da-da-da). David Arnold did a great job in C.R. and should have been the composer in this too (although I doubt that he could save this movie).And what's the deal with this lame song?

It is more like a blend of the stories of other housewives turned to businesswomen (if you can believe that) and contains lots of fictional elements for dramatic purposes.Nevertheless the plot is weak. So is the script.

Draft Day," Not for the Europeans...
","First of all don't confuse this for a 'Sports' movie.It revolves around the NFL Draft, an annual event where the NFL managers are selecting players to join their teams.It is a USA football thing, so if you are living in another continent, it is rather difficult to understand the rules and even more the point of this whole charade.About the rules is something of a Poker game. At least as it looks in this picture. The manager of team A is on the phone with the manager of team B and they talk things like 'I am giving you 2 of my first picks of the second round to give me your first pick for the next 2 years...' and so on.Again, this is NOT about who wins a game or a trophy. This is merely about picking players whom you think they might be useful to your team. In the actual games they may proved to be bad choices, or injured or whatever, and despite being happy about your choices in the NFL draft, eventually to lose games and the season.Now as movie 'Draft Day' is carefully designed.The direction and editing are trying to be 'edgy' with unique split screen effects during the numerous phone-calls between the team managers. You can see for example Kevin Costner (who plays the lead role as an experienced yet unconventional manager) in a split screen walking into the other side of the frame where the manager of the other team is.The music has a certain triumphant feeling without being to much in your face and the whole production is carefully designed.I point that out because in this movie you have constantly the feeling that you are seeing great things taking place. Like every little decision is something that could change the world. But in reality all these 'decisions' are something of a micromanagement. In the end and if you actually pay attention, what is happening and what the characters are talking about is totally uninteresting......and for the rest of the world, outside the US, confusing and pointless.",Null,25,45,25 July 2016
Law Abiding Citizen," Flawed action thriller
","This is the far-from-original story of a man who seeks revenge about the double murder of his wife and daughter. His is not just 'a guy' though. It never is! He is ...the best of the best (not original too).The premise is still interesting though. There are mind games to play in this. It's a thriller. It's not a Steven Seagal movie.BUT (I'm writing a non-spoiler review) the ending is preposterous and ridiculous. It ruins any possibility to take this movie as serious as you might have thought initially.The cast is terrible. Jamie Foxx is a really really BAD choice for the lead role of a macho D.A. with high conviction rates. This actor is more for comedic roles like in horrible bosses. Here, his acting is bad and his presence on screen even worst.The direction and editing is OK but the music is not. It has a character but in my opinion a wrong one. Don't like the mood it creates in combination withe the unsaturated blue-ish cinematography.Is it fun to watch? Not really. Blame Foxx, and the more dark and grizzly tone than it should have.Overall: Watch it if you want but you will be unsatisfied. Fpr some reason it reminds me 'The Next Three Days' with Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks which is faaaaar better. Watch that instead.",Null,4,6,18 May 2015
The Godfather," This film is the definition of classic.
","Although many films about gangsters preceded The Godfather, the way Coppola presented the Corleone family , and his portrayal of mobsters as characters of considerable psychological depth and complexity was something new.This film is the definition of classic. There are countless movies that in their script are mentioning ...this one! That says a lot.It affect movies, TV series, books, comics, animations, even video games.The dark drama and the struggle...the pain actually.Anyway you don't wanna miss this one and IMO it is better if you see the complete trilogy one after the other.",Null,1,3,23 October 2014
