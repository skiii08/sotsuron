Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Shouldn't have split the Bill
","When a 135-minute movie only contains 25 minutes' worth of entertainment, you know you've been had - especially when it's the last part of a single story and delivers nothing by way of a climax. On the way to its interminable denouement, we're subjected to some of the most pointless scenes ever committed to celluloid (Samuel L Jackson' cameo, Budd's boss, Bill's pimp father-figure).Vol. 1 had flaws, but at least it had balls. Vol. 2 is just weak. Not only that, it's horribly self-indulgent, often boring, and full of supposedly profound but ultimately meaningless dialogue. What happened to all that Pulp Fiction quotability, QT?Kill Bill could - and should - have been one rip-roaring film with an ending to blow us all to high hell. Instead, both of its drawn-out halves fizzle out like cheap fireworks to leave a disappointing whole.",3,2,4,27 April 2004
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Ironically, it drags
","This is one of those inoffensive and mildly entertaining little movies that strive to make you to like them more. But like so many others, it's material isn't strong enough to successfully fill a couple of hours.The pitch is promising: three drag queens drive a bus through the Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs. They run into lots of trouble - with homophobic locals, with the engine, with their pasts.The real trouble is with the dialogue. The leads are fine (though Pearce's continual campness becomes tiresome), but the one-liners and epithets feel forced where they should be casually thrown away. Characters shouldn't laugh at their own gags.Writer/director Elliott also feels the need to pile on the pleasingly incongruous shots of flamboyant drag costumes against stark desert backgrounds like so much cheap make-up. For a movie about self-confidence and just being yourself, it all seems very insecure with itself.",4,7,19,30 April 2003
Ali," Smith's a knockout, points lost elsewhere
","Fancy foot (and mouth) work from Will Smith holds the attention, but this could have been a better bout had it ended a couple of rounds earlier. The Nation of Islam stuff is murky, the score is too intrusive too often, and we never really get to witness the charisma and grandstanding that made the man. Did he really only turn on the personality for an audience? I doubt it. Fighting apart - and the fight scenes are very well done - there's nothing iconic about the Ali up on screen. A biopic that offers feints and jabs rather than any real piledrivers.",6,0,1,4 March 2002
Finding Neverland," Fall for it Hook, line and Tinkerbell
","To a dyed-in-the-wool cynic like me, the words 'uplifting', 'inspirational' and 'heartwarming' are marketing kryptonite. But if and when Disney start ladling the treacle on the Finding Neverland campaign, believe me, it really is all of those things. Marc Forster's direction is imaginative yet focused, sidestepping the many opportunities to lapse into schmaltz with frequent injections of humour and by keeping the, um, theatricals to a minimum. For the latter, he has a universally terrific cast to thank.Depp doesn't put a foot wrong as the dreamer whose relationship with children is based on mutual respect; Kate Winslet is fine in a fairly stereotypical role, the boys playing her sons are engagingly impressive, and Julie Christie should be at the head of the Best Supporting Actress queue as their icy but well-meaning granny.JM Barrie's estate might not be particularly thrilled at some of the artistic licence the makers have taken, but as far as I'm concerned, there hasn't been a more elegantly staged or appealing film all year.",10,0,1,12 October 2004
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Ignore the religious tub-thumping; this is one for the kids
","As an adaptation of a much-loved saga of mythical realms and fabulous beasts, largely filmed in New Zealand by a New Zealander, this first Narnian chronicle was always going to invite comparisons to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings juggernaut. But where Middle Earth was shrouded in gloom, Adamson's Narnia is a more welcoming place; a winter wonderland that children would love to explore, White Witch or no.The tale begins in dark times as the Pevensie children - Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter - are evacuated from blitzed London to the country mansion of twinkly Professor Kirke. During a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy (well-cast debutant Georgie Henley) stumbles into a room furnished only with a huge wardrobe, at the back of which she finds... a snowbound forest. And has tea with a faun called Tumnus.Of course, Edmund poo-poohs her story until he follows her and is lured into doing the bidding of wily white witch Jadis (the spikily splendid Tilda Swinton). If he brings her his siblings, he'll get as much Turkish delight as he can eat. Now that's sweet-talk.When the Pevensies arrive en masse, Tumnus is gone but a kindly Cockney beaver (voiced by Ray Winstone) tells them that only they can fulfil a prophecy to restore peace to Narnia by joining the righteous forces of the noble lion Aslan. But Edmund's treachery sets Jadis and her wolves on a relentless hunt to catch Peter, Susan and Lucy before they reach Aslan's army.Much has been made of the book's Christian overtones, but while the movie retains the story's core elements it goes easy on the preaching to provide well-intentioned and wholesome entertainment - you know, for kids? Admittedly, the self-sacrifice and subsequent resurrection of Aslan is laid on a bit thick and 'Jadis' does sound like 'Judas'. But it's possible to overlook the biblical themes to enjoy a basic tale of good-versus-evil.The pacing is brisk and the denizens of Narnia are nicely rendered (though the green-screen work is a bit shonky), from the earthly beavers and wolves to minotaurs, griffons, centaurs and cyclops(es?).Grown-ups will appreciate it as a cynicism-free breath of nostalgia... but they may have to keep an eye on the kids when they next go shopping for bedroom furniture.Just a few questions to ponder: where's Aslan been the last 100 years when he's needed? Why aren't the beavers afraid of humans wearing fur coats? How come Lucy's potion heals the most horrific wounds but not a cut lip? And why are all evil creatures - white witches excepted - ugly? Lord knows.",7,1,2,6 December 2005
Spider-Man 2," Eensy-weensy bit better than #1
","With action sequences that drive the plot, a sense of humour and a better villain, this is a vast improvement over its undeservedly successful predecessor.I don't agree that the characters are getting any deeper - we're just seeing more of them. If Mary-Jane loves Peter so much, why's she always flouncing around with other blokes? I think we all get that with great power comes great responsiblah-blah-blah; what I want to know is: why do Spidey's webshooters keep misfiring? It seems to happen when he's suffering from self-doubt, so it must be a Freudian thing.Spidey 2 also suffers from Hollywood's latest ailment - multiple tacked-on endings (see also Minority Report, The Bourne Identity, LOTR: The Return Of The King). Directors and editors take note: we want tingling in our spider-senses, not our backsides.",7,0,1,28 July 2004
Troy," Brad's bad in this sad Iliad
","Shame. All that time, effort and money to create an 'epic' of which nothing will be remembered within a month. For all its impressive production values, this bears the hallmarks of a rushed job: the direction is staccato, the script blows more hot air than the average sirocco, and Brad Pitt is, frankly, the wrong man for the job.Or maybe it's just his character? Achilles was a warrior of mythical prowess. A talisman. A leader of men. As written here, he's a sulky lout with dubious and contrary principles; a wobbly foundation on which to build a tale of legend. Likewise Orlando Bloom - would you risk a kingdom for this insipid drip? Thanks the gods for Bana, Bean and Cox who add weight to the often-dull proceedings.Try as it might, Troy fails to match - or even offer anything different from - the battle standards set by The Lord Of The Rings. And it might stir female loins, but the point is that it should have everybody's blood coursing. Unfortunately, it just gave me circulation problems in my rear end.",Null,2,4,4 June 2004
Spider-Man 3," Some new additions but Web 3.0's no upgrade
","Sam Raimi's Web version 3.0 proves that  like the increasingly shoddy sequels to Batman - when it comes to comic book villains, less is more. Really, does anyone remember anything that Two-Face and Poison Ivy actually did? After building his rollicking action empire with tight, one-on-one contests between our friendly neighbourhood hero and his nemeses, Raimi falls into the trap of taking Spider-Man 3 a villain too far. It has nothing to do with the CG qualities of either Sandman or Venom (they're as well-rendered as you'd expect from the next instalment of an $800million franchise). It's simply that the film introduces so many problems for Peter Parker to deal with, it doesn't fully focus on any.On the verge of proposing to Mary Jane, Peter is so caught up in his own hype that he has become a self-absorbed prat. Outwardly, they're fine, but he is so busy enjoying the adulation and attention - hey, police chief's daughter Gwen Stacy, how YOU doin'? - that he's oblivious to any problems MJ might have.And anyway, there's also some unfinished business with Harry 'Goblin Jr' Osborne, cocky photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is after his job at the Bugle, and convict Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is now a much bigger problem than when he first escaped after having his DNA replaced with sand. The guy's a walking building site.Then a black goo from outer space which feeds on human aggression (drug metaphor ahoy!) transforms Peter into a swaggering, greasy-fringed idiot - like a member of The Killers who's seen Saturday Night Fever too many times.But his turn to the dark side is reflected in the spider-suit's cool new look which is later adopted by Brock when the terrible treacle turns him into Venom. Let's get ready for a tag-team rumble Needless to say, it all looks fantastic. But, for all its impressive, whiplash-inducing set-pieces, jokey interludes, cute cameos (including Bruce Campbell as a Pythonesque maitre d') and general vertiginous pizazz, the plot regularly loses momentum.How many messages on commitment, redemption and doing the right thing does one film need? What's with the ridiculous climactic commentary from that TV reporter with the bad English accent and her geriatric, googly-eyed anchorman? Would Bryce Dallas Howard like to give me a call the next time she has this little to do in a movie? Like Spidey himself, Raimi appears to have gotten carried away by the success of his previous exploits. Webby 3.0 certainly gives you plenty of whiz-bang for your buck, but it doesn't get that spider sense tingling.",7,14,29,28 April 2007
We Were Soldiers," Battle scenes fail to save the day
","It's ironic that We Were Soldiers only begins to show signs of life when death engulfs the screen. The opening hour is interminably dull. And patronising. In case we didn't listen up during drill instruction, stoical Leader Of Men(TM) Mel Gibson repeats his 'I'll be the first on the battlefield and I'll be the last off it / All we have in war is one another' speech, only this time in a smarter uniform. In fact, most of the dialogue thuds like so many UXBs.Thankfully, the cliches don't extend to the de rigeur rogues' gallery of platoon misfits - only the ever-grizzled Sam Elliott and wide-eyed father-to-be Chris Klein warrant more than cursory screen time. This is just as well, because once they touch down in the warzone, they're simply cannon fodder.Wallace deserves some credit for staging the carnage well and giving the Viet Cong a point of view (though their commander's bunker-room debrief with his weary troops was less inspiring than an unenthusiastic sports coach giving a half-time team-talk).Like Pearl Harbor, this is worth watching for the second hour alone. At least Wallace's screenplays are unique in that most scripts have a weak middle - his problems lie elsewhere.",3,0,3,19 March 2003
Crash," Occasionally misses but hits hard and keeps running
","A snapshot of anger and intolerance in modern-day LA, Crash follows a group of apparently disparate characters whose lives intertwine over 24 traumatic hours. It's an impressive directorial debut from Million Dollar Baby scribe Paul Haggis. But as intelligent, provocative and marvellously acted as it undoubtedly is, Crash still relies on a string of clichés, contrivances and coincidences to hammer its message home.That message is: rich or poor, law-enforcing or law-breaking, hard-working or work-shirking  one way or another, everyone's a racist... but we all have a shot at redemption.With Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton and Don Cheadle in the mix, this was always going to be worth a look. And being a film about preconceptions, the film benefits from some interesting casting, with Sandra Bullock playing against type as a disaffected wife, Tony Danza as a sly TV producer and 'Ludacris' Bridges as a car-jacker with a chip on his shoulder about everything - including rap music. But even here, Haggis sometimes takes the obvious route by giving the most unsavoury-looking guy - Michael Pena's Latino locksmith  the purest disposition.Plot-wise and thematically, Crash veers from the predictable to the inspired. But while it also takes too much time to tie up its many strands, it is as thoughtfully made and thought-provoking an ensemble drama as you're likely to see this decade.",7,1,6,19 August 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," A grimly glorious fairytale with a dual personality
","Intoxicating, impressive and imaginative, Guillermo Del Toro's wartime fantasy has few detractors and rightly so. But the two halves of his story do not fit together as satisfyingly as one might hope. Like a collaboration between Ken Loach and Clive Barker, it's a cinematic non sequitur in which the sober and frequently vicious reality of Spain's fascist past is placed beside, but not reflected in, the dark looking-glass of the titular otherworld.Bridging the divide, young Ivana Baquero is disarmingly natural as Ofelia, treading carefully around her stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez; the most despicable screen villain of the year) while throwing herself fearlessly into the tasks assigned to her by the bolshy and vaguely untrustworthy faun Pan.By definition, fantasy requires no explanation. But Del Toro takes tangible elements from one world into the other (such as the healing mandrake root) while hinting that Pan and his fellow mythic beasts exist only in Ofelia's mind. Title cards saying 'Meanwhile...' would not look out of place between scenes detailing the grim conflict between Vidal's fascists and the forest-dwelling rebels and Ofelia's plunges into the otherworld.Incohesiveness aside, Pan's Labyrinth marks Del Toro as a true visionary who bends to neither convention nor compromise. Those prepared for nastiness are in for an audacious and visually glorious Gothic treat.",9,1,3,25 November 2006
Final Destination 2," Dude, where's your head?
","Sometimes I wish I was an American teenager. Then I could get away with these crappy threads, bang around to Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit without looking like a gimp, and describe films like Final Destination 2 as `awesome' without being ironic.This matches - and sometimes surpasses - the original for gleefully cruel, totally gratuitous and utterly splatterific deaths, and I only wish I'd been watching with a bunch of buddies so that I could hand out a high-five to celebrate every last one.For miserable misanthropes like me, this is nothing less than wall-to-wall fun. (The only flaw is that it repeats, then labours the 'death's big plan' babble from FD1.) But you've gotta respect a horror movie that doesn't spare a single gory detail. Awesome.",9,0,1,25 November 2003
Closer," Not close enough
","'I love you... No I love her... Or do I love you? No, it's her... I mean you... Er...' Oh, who gives a stripper's thong about these people anyway? They deserve one another. Sure, they're all quick with the banter but one's guy's a weakling, the other's a bastard, the girls are both incredibly fickle and none of them can make their minds up.This is a well-acted but rather smug film which offers little insight into 21st century sex and relationships. Like its characters, Closer just manipulates others with its hollow emotions and pseudo-cleverness.And anyway, a self-proclaimed American 'waif' like Alice  with no luggage, job or place to stay  would never have made it through customs in the first place. Yet we're supposed to believe that the British Immigration Service happily allow her to stay for four years. Or do they hand out green cards to waitresses and strippers now? Sorry to be pedantic, but if a film wants to be taken seriously",5,0,3,19 July 2005
Lost in Translation," Good... but not that good
","There's a distinct whiff of the emperor's new clothes surrounding Sofia Coppola's second opus. Deftly made and enjoyable though it is, it simply isn't the masterpiece that the critics would have you believe. But for the towering presence of Bill Murray, it would be no more memorable a piece of work than any of those high-quality one-off TV dramas the BBC used to churn out.Look up sardonic' in the Illustrated Oxford English Dictionary, and you'll probably find a picture of Murray. With a sidelong glance and the arch of an eyebrow, he raises the slight brief encounter' material to a higher level than any other living actor could hope to achieve.Nobody would contest that the script is wry and observant, but it's also rather smug. And after the first hour, the film begins to meander and lapses into self-indulgence before redeeming itself at the end.Forget the story, it's peripheral. The whole point of this movie, and it's a very good point, is Bill Murray.",8,0,0,15 January 2004
The Village," Let's have a good old chat about 'Those We Do Not Speak Of'
","He pulls the rug from under your feet, you pull out your wallet - that's the M. Night Shyamalan way. Box office receipts prove that building a movie around a twist can work beautifully, but what's left if, like me, the viewer is wise to the scam?Nobody gave away the ending of The Sixth Sense, but I'd done the math before the movie even started - 'The kid sees dead people!' + 'There's a great twist!' = 'A-ha!'. I enjoyed it none the less. The Village did actually have to begin before I worked out what was going on, but where The Sixth Sense still managed to sustain an air of suspense and creepiness, this became a mere exercise in red herring-spotting.No matter how rich the photography or how many orchestrally-prompted shocks and starts he throws in, Shyamalan squanders an intriguing set-up with a 'so what?' denouement.The cast aren't to blame: Richie Cunningham's daughter is excellent and William Hurt gets his best role in years but all the talk of 'Those We Do Not Speak Of' and the inevitable opening of 'The Shed That Must Never Be Opened' made me wonder when Night is gonna give us a 'Movie Not Based On A Gimmick'.",7,0,0,13 August 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Terminator 2 Reloaded
","Delivering plenty of well-staged action and SFX at high speed, nobody could argue that you don't get plenty of bangs for your buck here. But as it rewarms the plot of T2 without any conviction and expects the audience to accept coincidence after plot-pushing coincidence, this adds nothing to Terminator folklore.So a myriad vehicles and buildings are destroyed and countless guns are fired, but there is absolutely nothing here that hasn't been done before(and better) in the first two T's.  In fact, there's something sad about hearing Arnie refer to himself as 'obsolete'. For all its apparent energy, T3 - like its once-mighty star - somehow seems extremely tired.",6,0,0,1 September 2003
"I, Robot"," Looking forward to II, Robot
","Asimov's three laws of robotics comprise the only original component of this admittedly well-oiled sci-fi clone. Soldering together set-ups from (amongst others) Minority Report, Robocop and the entire Star Wars back catalogue, it's still a handsome and satisfying accompaniment to your popcorn.Ironically, the human characters are less three-dimensional than Sonny the CG droid (who, oh lordy, looks like Moby). Engagingly played though they are, we've seen them all a hundred times before, from the cop with a secret and his gruff but sympathetic captain to the frosty female scientist and the jabbering street kid. But it looks fantastic and scoots along quickly enough to overcome the plot holes, though blatant product-placement (how much did Converse pay for this ad?) takes some of the shine off.",7,0,0,16 July 2004
Van Helsing," Pantomime doesn't get any better
","Anyone who goes to an arse down/brain off movie like this expecting masterful plotting, sparkling dialogue and characters with depth shouldn't be there in the first place. When you're in Popcorn City, you don't stay long in the museum of high art.The New York Post blusters that Van Helsing `requires considerable suspension of disbelief'. No flies on those guys, eh, what with the streets being chock-full of vampires, werewolves and Frankenstein's monsters these days? Maybe they were referring to Kate Beckinsale's unsmudgeable make-up. Of course it's silly, loud and all over the place  that's the point. Those of a pretentious disposition are advised to stay home and pore over their Ingmar Bergman collections.This is non-stop, tongue-in-cheek fun. Even the exposition is larky. As scene crashes on top of OTT scene, it's amusing just to spot all the films being ripped off/borrowed from/homaged/pastiched: Aliens, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Stagecoach, Desperado, Gremlins, From Dusk Till Dawn, Star Wars, and any James Bond you care to mention. Even Dracula looks like the kiddie-catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.No it's not hugely original and the last five minutes don't do it any favours, but who cares? This is better than any of the big-budget dreck we were subjected to in Summer 2003.",8,0,1,25 May 2004
Collateral," Mission: Implausible
","Endless overhead tracking shots through neon cityscapes, skewed camera angles, mumbled dialogue and improbable plot developments - this is a thriller that yearns for significance but is ultimately just another exercise in style over substance from Michael Mann. Put another way, it's a handsomely staged disappointment.While Cruise is a believably inscrutable villain and Foxx an acceptable foil, the interesting premise is lost in a sea of improbability and eventually sunk by a hackneyed damsel-in-distress finale. Despite promising more than the usual guns'n'poses take on the genre, Mann's deliberate build-up never really gains momentum. The ridiculous nightclub shootout generates more laughs than excitement, leaving a hole in the movie's credibility that is never patched up. From that point on, the lifting of ideas from the likes of 'The Terminator' and 'Speed' underlines the fact that the plot has, indeed, been totally lost.Collateral reinforces my opinion of Mann as an assured filmmaker whose determination to produce something deep and meaningful seriously hampers his ability to entertain.",5,0,0,28 September 2004
Ratatouille," Good, unclean, unsavoury fun
","Another year, another dazzlingly animated, flawlessly directed and engagingly characterful palate-tickler from the masterchefs at Pixar.And yet however cute, cuddly and hand-washingly obsessive you make them, rats are rats. So while you're delighting in Remy's antics, remember that he came straight from the sewer. Rats  kitchens  wrong. What next? The adventures of Eddie the friendly E. coli bacterium who just wants to be a heart surgeon?Issues of taste aside, where The Incredibles and Toy Stories were laugh-out-loud funny, Ratatouille is constantly  but never more than - amusing. And though they're all French, why do certain characters have American accents while others don't (most noticeably Linguini, who comes across like David Schwimmer's Ross Gellar with ginger hair)?Ah rats, I should probably just shut up and heed the words of Peter O'Toole's marvellous, cadaverous Anton Ego. He nails the role of the critic perfectly.",8,1,1,12 October 2007
Spirited Away," Bazaar of the bizarre
","Animation is a medium with limitless storytelling potential, though Hollywood is only just realising it after years of Disneyfication. Even Pixar is guilty of pandering to Uncle Walt's family values, merely hinting at subversion so's not to cause controversy and keep those tills ringing in Ohio. Thankfully, there's no midwest in the Far East and filmmakers over there are more enlightened, shunning conservatism to create fascinating, free-wheeling adventures like Spirited Away.This is a real flight of fancy, a delirious and gutsy spin on Alice In Wonderland that embraces weirdness, springs plenty of surprises and might make those pre-teen smartypants forget about their popcorn for a few moments with some genuine scares.Though it frequently goes off on tangents  literally losing the plot in places  there's always so much to look at that it doesn't matter. Just go with the flow.",8,1,2,23 March 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Monster hash
","If ever there was a film that was never going to add up to the sum of its parts, this is it. Everyone loves Alien and/or Aliens (with which the series should have ended); Predator was a winner and its sequel certainly passed muster. Given that it owns the rights to both, that 20th Century Fox would eventually pit the 20th century's most monstrous sci-fi species together in a face-off was a no-brainer.Pity the result turned out to have no brains.Living down to expectations, AvP tumbles into an imagination chasm as soon as it starts. Shamelessly ripping off other movies (Mission: Impossible 2, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters...), it staggers through a string of humdrum action sequences - the exchanges between the ET adversaries being remarkably dull and messy - and highlights what a lazy rip-off it really is by relying on in-jokes to maintain interest levels.Plot holes are like fishes-in-barrels, but here are a few thoughts... Someone ominously pronounces 'There's nothing in Sector 14!' - yes there is! There's a bloody great disused whaling station there, the population of which all mysteriously disappeared 100 years ago. But don't think to look into it. For that matter, why do Predators only play this xenomorph paintball game every 100 years, when it's obviously such fun? And when Aliens are wounded, why doesn't their concentrated-acid blood react with water? In Alien it takes the critter several hours to pop out of John Hurt; here they go from facehugger to fledgling in about 10 minutes. Evolution is a obviously great thing - except in movie franchises.",3,0,1,5 October 2004
The Pianist," Adagio
","Heavy subject matter frightens people. Few dared say an unkind word about Philadelphia (AIDS!) when it first came out, regardless of the fact that it was dreadful. Folks seem similarly reluctant to find fault with The Pianist (The Holocaust!), though it's a far superior film.Being a survivor himself, Polanski is to be applauded for his clear-eyed depiction of life and death in the Jewish ghetto, but his matter-of-factness had a curiously distancing effect on me. I felt uninvolved. It was also a brave move to omit subtitles from the German dialogue, but getting the gist of what is being said is not the same as understanding and once more I felt left out.Further, many of the events leading to changes in Szpilman's situation remain unclear. On other occasions, Polanski labours his point and I just wanted him to move on to the next episode. He's a very good director, but he won the Oscar amidst a very weak field (and I include Scorsese's work on Gangs Of New York) - remember that this is the same body of people that anointed Ron Howard 'best director' a year previously.Impressive at times, but uneven and occasionally sluggish and frustrating.",7,3,5,2 October 2003
28 Days Later...," Scrappy-crappy nonsense
","The BBC made a nifty adaptation of The Day Of The Triffids when I was a lad back in 1981 and it scared the bejesus out of me. I was hoping that this similarly-themed tosh would give me a nostalgic case of the ab-dabs. All it gave me was the 'dabs' as I wiped away the tears after wasting eight quid and the best part of two precious hours on this badly executed, cruddy dialogue-ridden tripe.A man-made virus infects almost everyone, turning Britain into a nation of bloodthirsty lunatics (nothing new there, then). So when the 'infecteds' are around, which isn't nearly enough, this is almost fun. There's an interminably boring middle section involving a drive from London to Manchester which is about as exciting as the real thing, then we're holed up with a ragtag band of soldiers who turn out to be as mad and bad as the infecteds. The clichés and plot contrivances rain thick and fast (hey, wonder what'll happen to that infected grunt they've got tied up out back?) before the bloody and bloody silly denouement. And somehow the hero, not-so-fresh out of hospital, turns into some sort of Bruce Willis/Jet Li character at the end. Don't get me wrong, I can suspend disbelief with the best of 'em, but come on... I thought this guy wrote The Beach and the director masterminded Trainspotting? Where'd their IQs go?Credit where credit's due, though - it starts well on the deserted streets of London. But then Vanilla Sky did the same thing with Tom Cruise in Times Square, and look at the mess that found itself in. A let-down of the lowest order.",1,2,5,18 November 2002
Empire Records," Pop idle
","It may be down to the presence of Maxwell Caulfield ('star' of Grease 2 and megasoap The Colbys), but this unremarkable confection from the 90s has a curiously 80s vibe. We join the teen misfits working at laid-back Joe's music store just as life there is about to end as they know it. A big franchise is about to take over, so before The Man puts them all on 'mute', they decide to go out on a high. Apart from the suicidal goth chick, of course.With characters as sketchily drawn as these, it's no surprise that most of the cast are still unknown - with the notable exceptions of Renee Zellweger and Liv Tyler. The former did her career no harm by making the most of her sweet-slut role but, let's face it, Liv's looks and lineage were always going to guarantee her stardom.A harmless enough teen flick but essentially High Fidelity with an insipid script and inferior performances. The most fun occurs when Caulfield rocks up as a cheesy pop idol.",5,1,3,9 June 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Imagine Rocky with breasts but no sequels
","On the one hand, Million Dollar Baby is probably the most masterfully acted and beautifully crafted movie of the year, thoroughly deserving all four of its Oscars. But on the other, it lacks the originality and all-round satisfaction provided by fellow nominee Sideways.You know what you're going to get with a Clint-directed film; usually a story of human failings told through rich but moody visuals at an unhurried pace in unsexy locations. When he breaks out of this mould, you get Firefox, The Rookie and Space Cowboys.M$B teams spunky hick chick wannabe-boxer Maggie with grouchy mentor Frank, puts them on the road to success and then runs them off it in an extremely tragic manner. Imagine Rocky with breasts but no sequels.Clint combines power with light-footedness in the gym and in the ring, but some of the dramatic scenes suffer from screenwriter Paul Haggis's leaden, hackneyed dialogue which clumsily telegraphs each of the tragic events to come. But the actors, and Swank in particular, deliver it faultlessly.This is a movie about taking your chance when it comes, living for the moment and having faith in people, not religion (tellingly, the only 'f' word in the film is uttered by a priest). It is a thought-provoking and captivating film of unquestionable quality, but the idea of the working class girl with a boxing dream was realised recently, and perfectly adequately, in Girlfight. Originality is what makes a film great, so in that respect, M$B is a worthy contender rather than a true champion.",9,4,7,9 March 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino goes tantric with masturbatory moviemaking
","Since this is only half a film, I can only form half an opinion on it. I liked some of what I saw - a lot - but it was sandwiched between bits that bored (the last Thurman/Liu scene), baffled (the 'you prepare sushi, I bring sake' shtick) and generally annoyed me. You've made your point, QT, so go easy on the cheesy Oriental cinema homages, would ya? Some of it simply made me cringe; the dialogue between Thurman and Vivica A Fox thuds like a severed head hitting the floor.Tarantino has clearly made Kill Bill to amuse himself, and doesn't really give a flying foot massage whether he entertains his audience. It's certainly brash, bloody and different but love it or hate it, he's too cool (or so he thinks) to care.I have a sneaking suspicion that Kill Bill was always intended to be released in two parts, with the 'last minute decision' to split a single movie being a savvy bit of marketing between himself and Miramax (who, as everyone knows, are particularly adept at that game).Vol. 2 will determine whether I've been party to maverick moviemaking at its most audacious or just a director having a wonderful time with someone else's money.",6,0,1,13 November 2003
Big Fish," Burton lets another one get away
","Big Fish has its moments, but they are thinly spread through this surprisingly sluggish fable from Tim Burton. Largely bereft of his customary dark exuberance, his Gump-like tale flounders where it should float, weighed down by unnecessary sentimentality and laboured scenes that lose their punch.Nothing really happens when young Bloom gets lost in a creepy wood or caught in a storm or when he joins the circus or after he robs a bank. Somehow, his tall story just doesn't seem tall enough. Burton's previous flights of fancy have always had a flaw that I've never been able to put my finger on, but I think I've finally got it: he shows too much restraint. Beetlejuice should have been crazier. Batman was dark but not dark enough. Edward Scissorhands was blunted by cuteness. Mars Attacks! needed more subversion. Sleepy Hollow needed more Christopher Walken. Planet Of The Apes was just a mistake. Ironically, his best film is the one most grounded in reality: Ed Wood.Expectations are always high when we hear the words `from the imagination of Tim Burton'. It's high time he let it run riot.",Null,0,1,3 February 2004
National Treasure," Independence duh!
","The tried-and-trusted Bruckheimer formula makes this wild goose chase cornily entertaining for the first hour or so, then it starts to drag on a bit. In fact it drags on a lot. In fact, I was at the point where if another treasure hunter wandered into another gloomy, cobwebby nook or cranny just one more time, I was going to scream. Or leave.The tricksy but reasonably undemanding plot is fun, but the movie runs out of momentum, stretched as it is over two hours and stuffed with unconvincing, by-the-numbers characters. Cage looks sheepish, Jon Voight looks lost, Diane Kruger is little more than a pretty trinket and Sean Bean is about as menacing as a baked bean.National Treasure also confirmed two things: (1) Nicolas Cage can't run, and (2) Jerry Bruckheimer never makes movies with American baddies - not even the henchmen.",4,0,1,15 December 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," They shoulda pulled the plug
","Psst... Larry, Andy... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but nobody actually gives a toss about your precious plot. I felt the urge to shout 'Get on with it!' at least four times during this bilge. Honestly, I've never heard as much po-faced, pompous, philo-sloppical claptrap coming from a cinema screen in all my born days.Don't get me wrong, I thought The Matrix was great, but the Wachowski brothers appear to have forgotten to employ an editor on this one. They keep saying that Reloaded and Revolutions were 'one sequel split into two parts', and that's what this feels like - half a movie. What's criminal is that I was genuinely bored for much of Reloaded - even some of the action scenes felt bloated (have Neo and Agent Smith not realised that they'll NEVER beat one another in a fistfight?).It's all more Xerox than Matrix. But thank heavens for Carrie Anne Moss and PVC.",4,0,0,23 June 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," May divorce be with you
","With a well-turned calf and a dazzling grin, this preposterous action flick goes about its business with a gleeful disregard for logic and plot exposition. But with a hit-couple as ridiculously good-looking as Brad and Angie, it's not surprising that the camera sticks to them like glue, only tearing itself away long enough to focus on their destructive handiwork.The movie suffers from a beauty overload; too many long, lingering close-ups and scenes of navel-gazing slow it down. This is an action movie that loses its momentum too often, strategically timing each explosive set-piece to get things moving again.Despite the stop-startness of it all, there is much for action junkies to feast upon. The 'domestic disturbance' chez Smith is a stand-out, and both the desert hit and car chase deliver the requisite thrills in an 'is this a John Woo movie?' kinda way.But as the climactic, video game-like gunfight wore on, I thought that it would have been more interesting to have the Smiths squaring up to another couple of hitpersons, rather than legions of faceless goons who couldn't shoot fish in a barrel. But I suppose expecting originality from an action movie is preposterous too.",7,1,3,29 June 2005
Love Actually," Possibly the smuggest film ever made
","You can almost hear Richard Curtis chortling at his tripewriter as he trots out yet another batch of oh-so-clever gags, naff pop culture references, and mawkish sentiments. Weddings, funerals, Notting Hill, hysterical use of expletives - Curtis never seems to tire of having been there and done that, but I certainly have (the same thing happened after his brilliant Blackadder II series gave way to two largely uninspired follow-ups).I know that this is make-believe, but Curtis links his romances with ridiculous and lazily contrived scenarios to cover up the fact that this is nothing more than a collection of sketches. Admittedly, some are quite cute, but the 'horny idiot goes to America' story is just rubbish, and no number of celebrity cameos can fill the dead spaces in the script.The cast is certainly strong, but again, much of it is window-dressing - Keira Knightley might have million-dollar looks, but she's a two-bit actress. And Rowan Atkinson's store clerk is a direct rip-off of Eugene Levy's part in 'Serendipity'. At least Curtis has finally discovered that there are black people living in London.No doubt Love Actually's fans are legion, but no matter how much they enjoy it, they'll never be as pleased with it as it is of itself.",3,1,3,2 April 2004
Wedding Crashers," Crashes and burns
","Decent cast, good word-of-mouth and a no-beating-about-the-bush beginning, this was shaping up to be an amusing ride. It wasn't. The Xerox of a script, unimaginative structure and flat gags stretched to breaking point make Wedding Crashers a crashing bore. If Christopher Walken can't liven up your movie, nobody can.I like Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn even more, yet surely they can spot a duff script between them? For a comedy with an ostensibly good heart, it spices up a worrying number of its jokes with swearing. Profanity is my middle name, but even I know what's f****** funny and what isn't.And when will people realise that Will Ferrell isn't as funny as he thinks he is? Elf showed that he does have talent but increasingly he relies on self-conscious mugging and overplayed idiocy. Natural comedians aren't desperate for laughs - this guy is just a circus clown who got lucky. Rather than having me clapping my hands with glee, his appearance had me clapping them over my eyes.Overlong, over-familiar and over-praised, this movie made me feel very, very tired.",2,6,11,23 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Generally grievous
","The best of the final trilogy? Maybe, but that's like saying that Police Academy 6 is better than Police Academy 4. I understand why people are protective of the Star Wars saga  it's undeniably part of our cultural heritage - but let's face it, Episodes I-III will be remembered only for their sheer awfulness.Revenge Of The Sith is, for at least 75% of its running time, incredibly boring. From its opulent emptiness to the bumbling plot contrivances, I found its lack of ideas disturbing. Here are ten things to hate about Episode III:1. I lost count of the number of scenes which involve characters standing in front of what is essentially a computer-generated fish tank (with spaceships instead of fish) and spouting the sort of dialogue that wouldn't make it into the worst school play ever staged.2. If the Force is so wonderful, why don't the Jedi council practise what they preach, 'search their feelings' and prevent a few catastrophes rather than muttering about 'sensing evil' and looking grave? At least practitioners of the Dark Side use the Force to get things done rather than using it simply to move small objects around and close doors.3. And while we're on the 'greatness' of the Force, how come the remaining Jedi run and hide like cowards while the Sith take over the galaxy?4. General Grievous is the most inept villain since the Hooded Claw from Penelope Pitstop. Only less menacing.5. What the hell are 'younglings'? They're kids!6. The most feared being in the universe goes by the pet name 'Annie'. Oh, please7. Why does Yoda have to go to Kashyyyk when he could contact the Wookies by hologram? And why does he walk with a stick when he's capable of performing triple backward somersaults?8. Thanks to the material, Samuel L Jackson gives his worst performance ever.9. Isn't it rather selfish of Padme to give up on her children?10. So the droids have their memories wiped. How do they wipe Darth Vader's?At one point, Anakin demands 'What kind of nonsense is this?' That's what I'd like to know.",4,18,36,1 June 2005
Ray," Fantastic, Mr Foxx
","Let's not beat about the bush here, Taylor Hackford's undoubtedly slick movie has little to make it stand out from the biopic genre other than Jamie Foxx's exceptional, career-making performance. Remember the year they handed the special effects Oscar to the Terminator 2 boffins, uncontested? They should do the same with this year's Best Actor gong.That Ray Charles' story is worthy of filming is not in dispute. Indeed, the many flashbacks to his traumatic childhood are well-handled and judiciously used. But for a life so unique, the film seems incredibly formulaic and familiar. It follows the 'history of a flawed genius' template almost to the letter: hardship and exploitation, women and drugs, recording wrangles, band squabbles, rehab, yeah yeah yeah. And surely there was more humour in his life than we're treated to here?I appreciate Charles' music yet where neatly-cut medleys would have kept the story rolling, Hackford indulges himself with near-full-length renditions of too many songs - in gin joints, in the recording studio, in concert halls, infinitum. Narratively, and for non-devotees, they begin to act like a cinematic brake. This may seem like harsh judgement on a music biopic but with a catalogue as extensive as Ray's, we need a taste not the whole dish. Otherwise, we'd buy the albums.Intrigued as I was, I glanced at my watch more than once. So for all Foxx's brilliance, maybe Ray would have been better served as an HBO two-parter?",8,5,10,19 January 2005
Lord of War," Adding colour to a very grey area
","Writer/director Niccol's uniquely-spun morality tale is a worthwhile watch. With Nic Cage, he makes gun-runner Yuri an ethically bankrupt but rather likable chap, which has an unsettling effect on the audience. Should we admire him for his undoubted acumen and pragmatic approach to the distasteful arms trade or vilify him as a human leech who grows fat on the misery of others?Yuri takes us through his business (to him, it's all just business) in a first-hand account which pegs him as smart, smooth and inventive. His justifications for what he does are questionable at best, but at least he gives them - 'I'd rather people fired my guns and missed, just as long as they're being fired.' But he's sometimes too confident for his own good - and that of others.In many respects, this is like 'Blow' with guns, only better. It's all very Faustian but Niccol keeps it informative (What's an AK-47? Here's a quick history...) and sharply paced, keeping a dark sense of humour but largely staying true to the ultra-serious subject matter.The film's weakness lies with the secondary characters (though not the actors playing them; they're fine) - the younger brother (Leto) who goes off the rails; the loving wife (Moynahan) who says she doesn't need to know the truth but reacts predictably when she does; the dogged lawman (Hawke); the evil dictator (Eamonn Walker) and his trigger-happy son... We're familiar with these people so their fates hold no surprises.But the jarring life-of-a-bullet opening sequence is inspired, and scenes featuring seas of bullet shells, mountains of guns and tanks as far as the eye can see leave the audience in no doubt that this is a very grim business.One question Lord Of War doesn't answer is this: why do they call them 'assault' rifles? Don't all rifles assault?",8,1,4,14 November 2005
X2: X-Men United," The mutants aren't evolving
","The opening scene of 'X2' is a cracker, but from there the story and situations lack innovation and largely fail to deliver the goods. It's a real shame, as you won't find a more intriguing clutch of characters. The mutants are the whole point of 'X-Men' but most are developed no further than they were in the original, despite the filmmakers' pre-release promises to the contrary.Rogue, Professor X and the phenomenally bland Cyclops are genuine disappointments, and while Storm and Magneto hold their own, Nightcrawler is a missed opportunity and Lady Deathstrike is only required for a single scene though she appears throughout. Hugh Jackman's brooding presence as Wolverine and the shape-shifting powers of Mystique give the movie a boost whenever they're on screen, and Brian Cox does what he can with a role which is essentially that of the army guy who's forever chasing The A-Team.The whole set-up screams 'franchise' (you can almost hear the toy manufacturers drooling), but after the splash made by the original it deserves so much more.When X3 eventually comes around (XXX has been done, so 'X-cubed' maybe?), I say plot be damned - just let the mutants strut their stuff.",7,0,1,23 April 2003
Gangs of New York," A fine mess
","A sprawling, brawling mass of characters and ideas that will be remembered more for the hype and history of its production than for the history it depicts.Though the movie's scope and intentions are commendable, there's too much forced intimacy between protagonists and not enough about the actual gangs and how they coexisted (or not, as is the actual case). Love interest Cameron Diaz is only interesting when she's picking pockets, but otherwise an utter waste of time. Sadly, DiCaprio's lack of charisma makes him an unconvincing lead and ultimately scuppers the enterprise.And Daniel Day-Lewis? Oh, he's something else. But I just couldn't take him seriously. His crazy moustache and permanent squint so closely resembled that of Laurel and Hardy regular James Finlayson (who usually played Ollie's father-in-law or similarly cantankerous foil) that I was itching for him to turn to the camera with a well-timed `Doh!'Which neatly sums up Gangs Of New York Â– a fine mess.",6,0,0,17 January 2003
V for Vendetta," Vacuous vehicle for a verbose vigilante
","V is indeed for vendetta. But it's also for Vespa, an under-powered vehicle with a monotonous drone that takes forever to get to its final destination. How apt.Verily, the vessel of vigilantism with the vinyl-veneered visage is a verbal virtuoso who vindicates violence and vexes villains (and viewers) with vacuous values and vows of vengeance whilst voiding his victims with venom. And being such a valiant vouch-saviour of veracity, V's vile and vindictive behaviour is validated.Ergo, any vociferous vituperation must be vented at the vendors of this vapid and verbose venture because V For Vendetta is a virtual vacuum of vigour, vitality or verve. Or, to borrow the script's most over-used word: 'Boll**ks'.It's difficult to get behind an effete bore with no face and a Swing Out Sister wig who loves only one thing more than blowing things up: the sound of his own voice. Just when you'd put the bloated cod-philosophical ruminations of the The Matrix Reloaded's Architect from your mind, the Wachowski brothers have effectively given him his own movie.'Who? Who is but the form following the function of what.' Well thank you, Dr Seuss.It drones on and on (and on) about freedom of thought and non-conformity before dressing everyone up to look exactly like V in a final scene that would have been deemed too cheesy for an 80s rock video.And how many times do we have to watch a human kebab emerging from flaming ruins?Vendetta creator Alan Moore knew what he was doing when he washed his hands of this debacle. Pity Natalie Portman didn't do the same thing. She's dreadful  even if you ignore the accent stuck between Dartford and Durban.'I wish I didn't have to be here tonight' says one character. He took the words right out of my mouth.",2,4,9,13 April 2006
