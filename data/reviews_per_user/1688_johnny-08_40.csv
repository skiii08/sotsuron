The Devil's Advocate," Judging the actors
","Well, I like this kind of movie. From first to last this thriller makes us asking questions. And that's why I love this movie from my first viewing back in 1999. till yesterday, when I watched it again on TV. All right I admit; I probably catch it once more during that period. But with movies like this you don't get bored. You only notice some new details, or you watch just how one man acts. 9 years ago I was watching Pacino, because of him I lend this movie from video and yesterday I watched this movie as whole, with all its main actors, including Reeves and Theron. I don't want to talk about the whole script and about biblical meaning. This comment is about actors and about actors only.Plot is about young lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), who comes to New York from Florida, so he can work in the most powerful law firm in the world. His mother Alice (Judith Ivey) disagree with his decision but all Kevin wants is to make money and try to live happy life with his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). Law firm is in the hands of powerful and mysterious John Milton (Al Pacino). Soon, Kevin is sinking in his new cases and pays less and less attention to his wife, who feels homesick and has all sorts of bizarre thoughts connected with devil.I just love to watch performances from actors in these sort of movies. Al Pacino is one of my favorite male actors (with Depp, Brando and Dean) and his performance is stunning as usual. He plays with his role maybe a little too much, but we can all forgive such genius. He will probably never disappoint any of his fan. Such a perfect choice for role of John Milton.Charlize Theron. What to say after another great role? Theron gives us best performance from all three star actors. She is so convincing and she plays perfectly her role right till the end. You just gotta love her. An Oscar worthy performance.Keanu Reeves is our young lawyer and he really looks like one but this is not his role. He can't pull this movie on another level. He is trying so hard to act in some scenes but he just can't. In court room he is very good and all the scenes in which there isn't Theron are also good. Actually in scenes with Pacino, Pacino is letting him to act, so we can view his talent. Pacino with his experience is trying to help Reeves and you can't say that Reeves is bad in any scene with Pacino. He is just ordinary. I would like to remind you about one movie that was made also in 1997. 'Donnie Brasco'. Pacino helps Depp too, but Depp outshines Pacino in some scenes which is not the case with Reeves. Reeves is good and cool actor, but he'll never be great. That's just my opinion. You can either like it or not. Like every other thing in life.",8,1,2,28 September 2007
3:10 to Yuma," Good remake
","I've never watched the original version of '3:10 to Yuma', but this one really surprised me so I'm gonna say that this is a good remake. Mangold managed to hold my attention right till the end and there aren't any boring parts in this movie. Everything is made on high level of professionalism but what really puts life in this story are actors. I will extract only two names from this great cast list: Russell Crowe and Ben Foster. Crowe is excellent, so cold and strong acting. He's great as bad guy. But Foster surprised me, his ability of portraying Charlie Prince is stunning, cause I've never seen him in this kind of role. Christian Bale, young Logan Lerman and legendary Peter Fonda are also good, but Crowe mostly steals the show.This western is somehow different then all the others. Because westerns are made so people would enjoy themselves (especially for males); there are lots of shootings with plot that is always very easy to follow. But Yuma (and westerns like 'The Searchers' and others) takes a turn there. Yuma is not just a western, cause it has great story and great character development. Both, Ben Wade and Dan Evans are talking about their lives. How did parents treat Wade when he was child, what happened to Evans in the war, relationship between Evans and his older son and every conversation between Wade and Evans is great. There are so many topics to discuss about that this movie goes beyond normally western and makes my favorite 'western' movie. If you don't like westerns just watch it because of Crowe and Foster. Highly recommended.",7,2,5,23 December 2007
In Bruges," 'A lot of midgets tend to kill themselves...'
","All I knew before watching this movie are the actors that are in it. I like all the actors involved and I thought that this might be a good movie to watch, but I really had no big expectations. But I was surprised at the end. 'In Bruges' is a really good movie, with great dialogs and great actors and what I cannot forget to mention: brilliant photography that presents us all Bruges. There is no panoramic scene same like others. Just great! Movie is in some things similar to 'The Matador'. There, we've got only Brosnan shining in not so good movie; but here we've got Farrell & co. shining in very good movie. I must admit that I didn't expect such a good performance from Farrell after disappointing 'Alexander', 'Ask the Dust' and 'Miami Vice'; at least disappointing to me. So about the script.Movie is about two professional killers Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) who come in Bruges on some sort of vacation. There, they must keep low profile and wait for the further instructions of their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). As the movie goes on we found out that Ray is troubled by his first job. He accidentally killed a young boy while he was trying to kill his target. Because of that he's got suicidal thoughts. And one more thing, Ray really dislikes Bruges. His older partner, Ken is enjoying in Bruges and its culture, with all that old houses, churches, towers and canals. Ray meets ChloÃ« on set of the movie that took place in central of Bruges. But soon Ken is given instructions to kill Ray, because of his incident with the little boy.'In Bruges' is first long movie of Martin McDonagh. McDonagh wrote a fine scenario, where he puts one younger and older killer in front and fills the movie with big doses of dark humor (mostly coming from Ray, who acts sarcastic about everything) and nice turn in a story. I must say that the ending is quite unexpected; it's not American happy ending where everybody lives happy after. That's why this movie is so good. With message that you must follow your principals and with lots of irony, humor and strange events (like dwarf war). Also McDonagh presents his characters like ordinary people, with all their problems. But what's most important is that he managed to combine humor and human tragedy (Ray falls in love but he must be punished because he killed a child) in a way that at the end you feel sorry for main characters even though there is no completely positive character (only that little boy). So, 'In Bruges' is not a movie for everybody. If you expect action comedy, look somewhere else. Cause this movie has a big touch of drama and makes you think about it. Great debut for McDonagh, one of the best roles for Farrell and great movie for me (and I hope for all of you).",9,4,9,23 August 2008
Oldboy," Excellent in it's sickness
","I looked at program for today and I saw movie 'Oldboy'. I read plot and I liked it. What I expected is decent thriller from very good South Korean cinematography,something like 'Salinui chueok '. But once again I was wrong. 'Oldboy' is masterpiece, so unusual from all other movies. I've seen lots of violence on screen and to me this isn't nothing new but I think that people under 18 really shouldn't watch this one. It's because movie is brutal and I don't think that younger ones would fully understand this one.To say something about plot is quite impossible because I don't know where to begin. If I start talking about the movie I could tell few important things and I know that people often read other comments because they didn't watch that movie. So,I'm going to say only what I read before watching this movie.On his daughter's birthday, Oh Dae-su gets drunk and soon he's arrested by the police. His best friend No Joo-hwan somehow manages to get him out of jail and when No Joo-hwan is making a phone call Oh Dae-su disappears. Someone kidnap's him and puts him into room during 15 long years.But one day he's released.That's the plot. Very interesting, you should watch this movie and then judge it. By the rating on IMDb this movie is in top 250 movies. Now I can understand why. This plot that I wrote doesn't reveal the greatness of the people who wrote the script. I bow to them because this movie is so good, with all those twists and it really represents a whole new wave of making a movie, of writing a script and of acting in it. About direction and actors I can say only good things. Director Park Chan-wook won prize Grand Jury at Cannes. That's enough about direction part. About actors. I can say that I'm impressed by one actor:Choi Min-sik. He's amazing in major role and he showed great potential. I hope I will see him again in some good movie.I cannot say anything more because I could reveal some secret and I don't wanna do that to all new viewers. Only a recommendation. Beautiful, intelligent masterpiece of movie that I highly recommend for everyone with strong stomach and too all of you who want to see one excellent, but sick story. 10/10",10,301,461,22 July 2007
Batman Returns," Batman returned with style
","After first Tim Burton 'Bat' movie we all expected second one to be if not better then at least equal to its predecessor. While 'Batman' is mostly one man show (Jack Nicholson) coupled with capable direction of Burton; this one full field my every expectation and I think it is even better then the first and holds a nominee for best Batman movie ever made. Let me tell you why...'Batman Returns' has a great story and every character is elaborated to tiny details. Batman's enemies are Penguin and Catwoman and by entrance of new and interesting characters 'Batman Returns' gained only pluses. Here, I must say that all the cast done their job with no stains. Michael Keaton had tougher role then in first one and he passed the test. As always Batman movies is as good as the villain is. Danny DeVito in role of Penguin is amazing, just like Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman who had acting transformation from boring secretary to a deadly Batman opponent and love. If only makers of the 'Catwoman' and Halle Berry watched what real Catwoman should be, maybe they wouldn't make one of the worst movies ever. To round this excellent casting I will mention Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. Classic staff and here Walken is memorable.But what movie would Batman be without dark genius, and my favorite director, Tim Burton. Burton created Gotham city that none of the directors after managed to copy (we've all witnessed on how low branches Schumacher took it and how Nolan tried to raise it from dead with success). So dark, creepy and atmospheric. He plays with light in scene where Walken decides to get rid off Pfeiffer, he creates mean Penguin with classic Burton bright side (benneath all he's a good person that is always abandoned from people). There he reminds me of Edward Scissorhands, another Burton's 'child'. So till now you've realized that I like this movie, cause it's a comic brought to life thanks to Tim Burton and his never ending creativity. He managed to round the picture with no holes and if you don't understand Burton's work then you probably won't be able to enjoy in this Batman fully. Cause this one has Burton signature all over it and now it's official that Batman returned with style.",8,1,2,17 May 2008
Alexander," Do you know who was Alexander, cause Stone wasn't sure?
","I like history very much and I think that Alexander is definitely one of the most intriguing historical persons. He ruled the entire known world and he was so young when he died (33) that it's impossible for us to understand how did he conquered everything and yet remain undefeated in battle. Stone's Alexander is boring. And the question is: how did Stone succeeded to make such a boring movie from such interesting character? I will give you as much answers as I can.Casting. It is quite amazing how none of the actors managed to fit his/her role.Directing. Stone is great director but he's lost in this kind of movie. Stone's 'Platoon' is one of the best movies but after 'Alexander' and 'World Trade Center' I'm asking myself what is he doing? Other director is required for this movie.Music. Music is good but why we are listening it while the fight is taking place? At first major battle music takes place as priority and real sounds of battle are lost. Big minus.Length. The entire movie is so long. It just goes on and on. I don't mind sitting and watching something good for three hours but this isn't that case.Narrator. Stone uses narrator to tell us the whole story and his narrator is Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins). If Stone didn't use the narrator the whole movie would be faster and some boring parts would be cut out.Fighting scenes. All battle scenes aren't impressive and this film is called spectacular. Spectacular for what? In what part? In this kind of movies spectacle is granted by big fighting scenes. But there are many elements required to make good fight scene. One of them is leading actor.Colin Farrell. Stone's first choice was Russell Crowe. Crowe said no and then Farrell got the role. From Crowe to Farrell. That's a large step. Crowe's strength and appearance vs. Farrell's weak and fragile look. Alexander was strong individual whose strength was his main plus. Do Crowe and Farrell look the same to you? Angelina Jolie. Why oh why? She's Olympias, you know the mother of Alexander (Farrell). But when I last checked Farrell had 31 and Jolie 32. Possible?Mistakes. I don't even want to talk about this part. There are so many mistakes. From years to changing scars on actors from one scene to another. Accent and language. Alexander is speaking English? Oh well Stone is not Mel Gibson ('Passion','Apocalypto') but why his actors are changing accents? Olympias sounds like European in some scenes and Alexander has British accent. It's enough. I'm done, I don't want to think about this movie any more. If only the movie won some of the Razzies. Stone deserved it. Really disappointing effort for such established director.",2,8,12,6 October 2007
Insomnia," Nolan's remake, with brilliant Al Pacino
","Story follows two detectives who came into small town on Alaska to solve the crime. Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) accidentally shots his partner Detective Eckhart (Martin Donovan) when they were catching the murderer. But Dormer doesn't admits his mistake and instead of that he gives an alibi. Local cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) is trying to figure out what happened that day and how/why did Dormer shoot Eckhart.Christopher Nolan delivered 'Insomnia' after his masterpiece 'Memento' and he really didn't left me disappointed. 'Insomnia' is remake of Norwegian movie with the same title (with Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd in main role). Since I didn't watched SkjoldbjÃ¦rg's movie I cannot compare both of them but I can write some of my thoughts about Nolan's remake.You can really make psychological profile of every single character and then you can explain their behavior. So, Dormer is old detective that knows everything about his job, but he makes mistake when he accidentally shoots his partner and then cover up everything. Why? Well he cares about his reputation and he also has investigation on his back in L.A. He's bothered with insomnia and when he manages to fall asleep he always dreams that unfortunate scene. Al Pacino played Dormer with perfection. He has a perfect face to act man bothered with crime and insomnia. He's one of my favorite actors and here he shines. Man Dormer wants to catch is Walter Finch, sick man and a murderer. But Finch saw everything and Dormer must play his game. But are they so different? They both killed and they both aren't good guys. Here we have Robin Williams in not so usual role for him. But he managed to pull it off and he showed all skeptics (if those exist) what he is capable of. Opposite of Dormer and Finch there is young cop Ellie Burr, the only positive character. Although Ellie admires Dormer, she does investigation and notices irregularity in Dormer's report. She is ambitious and she eventually finds out the truth. Hilary Swank did her usually good job and she's natural talent cause she's not educated actress.At the end right people deserves to die and Dormer says the most important sentence of the movie: 'Don't lose yourself!'(or something like that), when Ellie wanted to throw the bullet away. So at the end of my comment I must recommend this movie and original too. This one because of Nolan/Pacino/Williams/Swank collaboration and the original because of...(we shall see).",7,0,0,9 June 2007
Cloverfield," Shocking
","I watched 'Cloverfield' few days ago and I have mixed emotions. Good is only the shoots taken with camera. The whole set of attacked New York is very good and actually the whole movie starts good by filming a goodbye party for Rob Hawkins, who got job in Japan. Suddenly all the party guests are terrified by something that at first looks like earthquake. But it's not. It is big monster that attacked NY. The atmosphere reminded me of the crashing of Twins and it's director dedication to that sad day. But hey people, they survived a crash of a helicopter!!! Big monster is killing everyone but our main characters are filming it (I would see them in that situation; they would run for their lives)!!! Gigantic monster managed to sneak upon our cameraman!!! That camera is made of some unbreakable material!!! We don't know nothing about this monster!!! Monster looks idiotic!!! But I'll wait for 'Cloverfield 2' to get my questions answered. Can't you see that this movie is money making piece of nothing special. Where is the movie art in this so called spectacular film? The only thing that is spectacular in here is camera. Where can I buy one 'shock resist' camera?",4,4,10,8 February 2008
Snatch," Hell yes, I want more...
","If you liked 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', you will love 'Snatch'. 'Lock...' is a bit different movie, cause Ritchie introduces us with the way he's making movies and the whole atmosphere of London he wants to present. While 'Lock...' has more 'domestic' look, 'Snatch' has more well-known actors (bigger budget) and also a story that doesn't get behind Ritchie's first movie. My personal favorite is 'Snatch', although I gave maximum grades to both movies.Ritchie's constellation of characters is simply great. Here, the story follows Turkish (Jason Statham), an unlicensed boxing promoter, and his friend and colleague Tommy (Stephen Graham). They are involved into the world of match fixing by the notorious Brick Top (Alan Ford). Things get complicated when the boxer they had gets beaten by Mickey (Brad Pitt). Tommy is guilty for that, cause he wanted to buy a caravan from the Irish Gypsies (Mickey and his 'family') and things get pretty wrong. Now Turkish and Tommy tries to convince Mickey to fight for them and eventually lose. At the same time, a huge diamond is stolen, so that involves lots of strange characters, like 'Cousin Avi' (Dennis Farina), Boris 'The Blade' (Rade Serbedzija), Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro), Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) and lots more, who all want diamond (on one way or another) for themselves.We've got bunch of crazy characters, excellent story and brilliant direction that makes this movie interesting and not for a second boring. My favorite character is Boris 'The Blade', played by Serbedzija. Maybe I'm not very objective, cause I'm Croatian just like Rade but he really had amazing character and he acted perfectly. But the best performance comes from Brad Pitt. He is memorable as Mickey and this is definitely one his best roles in career. Of course I bow to everyone else, especially Ford (brilliant), Statham, Jones, Farina, Del Toro and those three 'bookie robbers': Robbie Gee, Lennie James and Ade. They afford me laugh that is hard to forget. Thank you all. All that I can say is that I want more, more of this sort of characters and more of this kind of bizarre situations. And of course more of Ritchie's humor that blown me off the first time; and now once again.",10,0,1,13 February 2008
Final Destination 2," Oh,what a crap
","'Final Destination 2' isn't better then the first one.This movie is stupid and so predictable.You can't compare work of James Wong with the one of David R. Ellis.Wong is much better director.Actors aren't good.Ali Larter didn't perform like she did in a first one and the only reason I watched this movie till the end is A.J. Cook.She's cute and I like her.And that's not because the way she acted.There is a big problem with filming the second movie because there aren't many movies who were better then first one.And that is a problem,you always expect better.I didn't like the whole movie and specially that scene with the birds.It is so obvious that it is taken from Hitchcock's 'Birds'.Also it's a shame that movie like this should even be mentioned in the same contest with brilliant 'Birds'.When you put all together you realize that you spend 90 minutes of your life on something that you could skip.Don't watch it and you won't regret it.Nothing new and nothing original to be seen.",3,1,2,3 June 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," God, that's good!
","Went on premiere of 'Sweeney Todd' here in Croatia yesterday and I must say that this is brilliant movie on so many levels. I had high expectations because of Burton's previous work and Depp's magical ability of portraying every single role on this world. Two of them never ever failed in my eyes. After movies like 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Ed Wood', 'Sleepy Hollow', 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', 'Corpse Bride', we've got 'Sweeney Todd', another masterpiece from this productive duo. Burton, as always, took the risk of making such a movie. It's very hard to make a movie based on hit Broadway musical and Burton does it with no problems and yet with his so well known signature. Story follows Benjamin Barker (barber), who returns in London after years in exile for a crime he didn't commit. Barker comes back as Sweeney Todd, who wants his revenge. He must find where are his wife and daughter, with a little help from Mrs. Lovett (owner of meat pie shop). Man who is guilty for destroying Todd's life is evil Judge Turpin. But not one man killed, or ten thousands men can satisfy Sweeney's appetite for revenge.As always Burton assembled great cast. Here we've got his all time favorite Johnny Depp as Sweeney Tood, his wife Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett, Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin and Sacha Baron Cohen as Adolfo Pirelli. You simply don't know who was better. Depp in Oscar worthy performance, Cohen in great small role, Rickman as villain or Bonham Carter who portrayed her character with perfection (all of them are amazing). Also I must say that young Ed Sanders is great. All the singing parts are done by the actors. Johnny Depp wasn't bad and Bonham Carter was very good. They sing most of the songs and I think they did a good job (just like all the rest). Johnny Depp makes another memorable role. After so much beautiful created characters, he plays Sweeney Todd ('Epiphany' is amazing). A man who wants his revenge, a mad man, a killer. Depp never played such sick person, Sweeney is like evil brother of Edward Scissorhands. Depp's range of emotions is unique and this is Oscar worthy performance (he was in every movie genre and he's done it all with perfection). Maybe this will be finally his year, but we don't need a golden statue to acknowledge one of the best actors today.The whole movie is amazing. Starts from the port and we see streets of London just like we're looking at play in a theater. Burton's dark tone is great and it represents how Sweeney feels. There are few bright colors, like in Mrs. Lovett dream of her happy life. Maybe the whole movie starts a bit slow, but from the entrance of Adolfo Pirelli it takes great turn. We are drawn into the story with beautiful simplicity that only Burton can create. There is lot of singing at the beginning and only one boring and annoying character of Anthony Hope (at least to me), but Burton needs all that so he can present the whole story. So to conclude, I was very surprised with this movie cause I didn't expect this and I would like to recommend it to all of you. Burton, Depp, blood, music, atmosphere, revenge. All that you can see in this beautiful achievement of cinematography. I will just repeat a title of one song: 'God, that's good!'",10,0,1,16 February 2008
Corpse Bride," 'Why go up there when people are dying to get down here?'
","When Maggot says: 'You don't know me, but I used to live in your dead mother.', you really cannot miss the man behind these lines. It is obvious that dark knight Tim Burton got something to do with it and his 'Corpse Bride' is real winner. Visual masterpiece and I'm very unhappy that Academy didn't award this genius because his animated movie is so different from all others. But that day will come when Burton is going to get an Oscar. I'm sure of that.The story is about Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) who has to marry a woman named Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson). The marriage is set up by their parents before Victor and Victoria even get to know each other. Victor jumbles his vows so he goes into the woods to practice. When he finally gets it right, he says his vows correctly and places the ring on a weird looking twig in the ground. That happens to be a hand of Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter), so Victor is now married and he is taken to the Land of the Dead to join his new wife.Only Burton could direct this bizarre but brilliant story (with help of Mike Johnson) and this is movie for everyone to watch, with so many dark humor and so many funny situations. All funny moments are coming from the characters that are made perfectly and really every one of them has something special that makes him different from other. Parents (Everglot and Van Dort) are made like their only wish is to get some profit from marriage of their kids. Everglot's get money and Van Dort's get reputation. Barkis Bittern is very negative character and he's a true villain. All other characters are opposite of him. Victor is innocent and good, just like Victoria. Corpse Bride (her eye pops out just like Ragetti's in Pirates) has heart at the end and she's not that 'dead' as it seemed. Elder Gutknecht, Skeletons, Black Widow Spider, Maggot and other crew are simply brilliant. Actually there are so many emotions in every character that that cannot be described by words.Burton connected everything with other movies. He assembled his usual cast - Johnny Depp (their fifth collaboration), Helena Bonham Carter (his wife), Christopher Lee, Deep Roy, with few new faces (Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Jane Horrocks, Paul Whitehouse...). I just have to say that all actors made their characters alive. Everyone did excellent job. Some scenes from Pirates can be seen here (eye, hand). Victor (Depp) lets butterfly at the beginning of the movie (in 'Sleepy Hollow' Depp lets bird out of cage). Have you noticed that main characters have names Victor and Victoria (name of Blake Edwards musical comedy starring Julie Andrews; name comes from German original). Also Burton uses one of the most famous movie lines : 'Frankly my dear I don't give a damn!' (from 'Gone with the Wind') when old skeleton sees his alive wife. And there are lots more very funny and innovative scenes to be seen in this one.Special thing is music. Danny Elfman is great and all his musical numbers are simply outstanding (from first when parents are singing to my personal favorite when skeletons are singing ). Elfman is going to win that Oscar statue, just like Burton and Depp will one day. Oscar is not measure of a great director, actor or songwriter but I'm purposely mentioning Oscar as the higher standard of every person involved in movie. But as long as they keep up doing their job in the way they done it till now they are all winners in my eyes.",10,0,0,20 November 2007
Gone Baby Gone," Great surprise and another proof that actors can direct
","Ben Affleck's first directing try and definitely good one. 'Gone Baby Gone' is not a masterpiece, 'only' a good movie and one of the biggest surprises of 2007. Why? Story is the most important part of every movie. This one has the story and it talks about disappearance of 4 year old Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien). Amanda's mother Helene (Amy Ryan) is drug addict so girl's aunt Beatrice McCready (Amy Madigan) hires two private detectives: Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), who all also lovers. Chief of police Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) wants to find the girl, as he is tormented with the disappearance and death of his own daughter, so he assigns detectives Bressant (Ed Harris) and Poole (John Ashton) to help Patrick and Angie.Story is simply great, because you don't know what is going to happen till the end and the suspense is also on top. What is also good is that Affleck managed to present us great shoots of Boston and his interiors are also remarkable (especially house of Trett family). If you have a good script you can attract good actors too. Ben had luck so he could hire his brother Casey for the main role and on that way he managed to escape his own appearance in this movie (which is great because he could stay focused only on directing). Ben also knows abilities of Casey and two of them works just fine. This script also attracted great stars like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris (my personal favorite in this movie). But Amy Ryan (Oscar nomination) in the role of Helene provides us what this film needs. Great role of mother who is torn between drugs and her missing baby. Only one thing that bothered me in this casting: Michelle Monaghan. Her character is in this story only because of that scene when Patrick has to choose what he will do at the end. Monaghan wasn't given a role so she could show her acting abilities and that is the only weak link of this great scenario. My favorite scenes are conversation between Patrick and Bressant, when Bressant is drinking (Harris is great!!!) and of course the last scenes in the McCready house and the whole issue that is put in front of Patrick (cause he controls Amanda's future). At the end I've got one plea. Please watch this movie, cause it's good, strong and innovative.",8,1,3,28 January 2008
28 Weeks Later," We can expect '28 Months Later'
","'28 Days Later' were excellent horror movie to me mostly because it was differently made from all other horror movies of that type. OK, I admit. It was also because of brilliance of Danny Boyle, who had a vision to make a very good horror movie; and sadly good horrors today are rare.'28 Weeks Later' is a sequel and this movie wasn't disappointing in my eyes. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo replaced Danny Boyle and he brought something new in the movie. This sequel isn't better then the original but still represent good fun. What I liked about his way of directing is when zombies (couldn't think of another word) are attacking, his camera is all over the place. That is very interesting because everything happens so fast and the camera is shaking just like we're in the middle of action. Like we're running with them. I liked that and also I liked that helicopter-chopping scene. Very cool but nothing new. What is also special about this movie are characters. Did you notice that main characters doesn't save the day? They are far from doing that and this is something that is good and out of ordinary horror movie. There are no heroes, just victims. The entire story isn't realistic all the way long but the whole plot managed to hold my attention until the end. The ending was solid and it is obvious that third part is going to be made. Maybe '28 Months Later' (or some other name) will come closer to the original then 'Weeks' did.",6,4,6,26 October 2007
The Village," Look deeper
","When this movie came out I went in cinema to watch it, and I didn't find it very interesting at first view. Then I watched it again on TV and it really intrigued me. Shyamalan is great director and people cannot expect of him to make movie like 'The Sixth Sense' every time. 'The Village' isn't definitely his best movie but this also isn't his worst movie. 'The Village' has its positive attributes, like great entering and solid story but maybe poor finishing. Slow rhythm of the movie is great cause we really need to be drawn into the story on this way. I also want to say that this is no horror, it is more drama of people who live in one community on traditional way. Study of characters is great just like actors are (especially Bryce Dallas Howard). Shyamalan wanted to show the thoughts of the whole community we're talking about. They gave up from real world so they can create their perfect world. Even when someone gets hurt, he's only making a sacrifice for future of the society. The question that director puts in front of us is this: Would Lucius stay alive if Ivy wasn't blind or would elders let Ivy out for medicine if she wasn't blind? And that is the point of this movie.I recommend to watch this Shyamalan movie and then judge it. In my case after second view a whole new perspective was opened to me. To all second viewers: look deeper.",7,0,3,21 November 2007
North by Northwest," Great script and Hitchcock's genius direction makes this film interesting even today
","Today, when technology is getting advanced by every new day, movie scenes like the one on Mount Rushmore in 'North by Northwest' looks very funny, but I must admit that this movie is great even from todays perception. One of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies has his favorite actor Cary Grant in it, blonde girl Eva Marie Saint and excellent actors like James Mason & Martin Landau. So to say long story short; I enjoyed in this movie and I'm 'only' 19 years old (this movie was made almost 50 years ago!!!). Why? Because of great scenes coming from genius Alfred Hitchcock, brilliant script that makes this movie a great thriller, with twists, good performances and some comedic parts (coming from Cary Grant and Jessie Royce Landis). So if you have opportunity, watch this movie cause it's a classic.",8,5,7,30 May 2008
The Shining," King + Kubrick + Nicholson = great horror
","Today it is very hard to catch a good horror movie, so we all have to remember some true horror classics. 'The Shining' is definitely a horror classic and also a King's classic. Stephen King wrote many excellent books and I think that this is maybe best translation of King's book on screen. 'Misery', 'The Shawshank Redemptione', 'The Green Mile', 'Carrie', 'Secret Window' and others are also great but we have to consider that this is one of the first 'King' movies. Back in 1980. one very special director managed to make one very special movie. Of course I'm talking about Stanley Kubrick and 'The Shining'. Kubrick managed to create fear that book has (brilliant scenes when Danny is riding his bike through the empty hotel and that sound of wheels). He managed to make the atmosphere and he scared us all. His camera is great and this movie is a result of his genius. Music is creepy, Danny's imaginary voice is creepy (Tony), Overlook Hotel is creepy and Jack Nicholson is the king of creepiness. He is perfect for the role of Jack Torrance. With his crazy eyes, attitude and personality, he makes brilliant portrait of a man who gets insane as the time passes. I don't like Shelley Duvall but I have to admit she was good. She was very convincing and she behaved like every ordinary person, in her position, would behave. All my compliments goes to Danny Lloyd too, cause he was very young and yet he acted so well. To all you horror lovers and to all movie lovers. This one is for you. You don't need to watch most of todays crappy horrors. Just watch 'The Shining' and prepare yourself for one twisted story.",9,3,6,6 February 2008
Disturbia," I expected a bit more
","Good sides: 1) Basic plot story is believable. All of us stayed in house for couple of days and when you are really bored, you just go and see what other people are doing. You're not a voyeur if you look through your window and it is possible that you'll find some strange things about your neighbors; things you don't notice every day. 2) Director D.J. Caruso managed to make a good movie on direction part. His camera angels are solid and the use of normal camera that is given to the characters is great, but it's not very original. 3) Acting of Shia LaBeouf is absolutely for praise. Shia confirmed that he could turn out to be a good actor. 4) 'Disturbia' is not a bad movie but since I watched so many very similar movies this one will not leave any tail as great thriller in my memory. But this is movie that you can easily watch and it isn't good but it also is not that bad. And one thing; this is not horror thriller, because there is nothing scary in it. If you were afraid, you are either juvenile or person who can easily be scared.Bad sides: 1) The whole movie reminds me on few other movies like 'Rear Window' and especially 'The Shining'. Why must the villain in this movie try to enter through the doors like Jack Nicholson? 2) After solid beginning this movie starts to sink when we realize that there is killer involved here. All the scenes from the moment Julie Brecht enters the house of Robert Turner are a bit stupid to me. Let me tell you why. We are presented with normal characters here and also they are very human; they do what normal people do in every situation. But do you have a killer next door? 3) The ending. I don't like it. Ronnie is hit with metal baseball bat and he is OK. Kale managed to beat a man who killed at least 10 people and of course our main characters lived happily ever after. Yes, only in 'Disturbia'. 5/10",5,2,5,22 January 2008
Tropic Thunder," 'I don't read the script. The script reads me.'
","'Tropic Thunder' is one of those movies that you either like or dislike, there is no middle. I liked this movie and it's one of the better Ben Stiller movies but here Stiller, as director-actor-writer-producer, turns center of attention away from him. In many scenes there is no Stiller, which makes stars like Downey Jr., Black, Cruise, McConaughey and others their share of time on screen. Stiller imagined this one to be a parody of every war movie and that's what this movie is all about. If you expect to see something other then plain jokes about everything (church - Maguire & Downey Jr., mental retardation - bothered me little, war, war heroes - Nolte, movie makers, movie stars - behavior of actors on the set before they were put in the jungle, studio head - Cruise, Oscars...) just don't waste your money to see this movie. But if you're in for fun this will be a great ride. Connoisseurs of war movies will easily recognize classic war movies like 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon', 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' and if anyone felt offended about spoofing them, I say don't be. Although I am a big fan of those movies, this is a comedy, where everything is allowed. The whole movie also gets big plus in amount of very well known faces skillfully combined together; so we've got comedy genius Jack Black, very good Tom Cruise (not the best role like someone said), solid Jay Baruchel & Brandon T. Jackson (Alpa Chino :D), Matthew McConaughey as Stiller's agent, Nick Nolte as fake movie veteran, and cameo appearances of Maguire, Voight, Love Hewitt, Rooney, Banks... I purposely left out one name that really stands alone and raises above every single actor in this movie (at least in my opinion): Robert Downey Jr. He is such a brilliant actor, neglected because of his drug problems and in need for big blockbuster that would put him on A acting list. His hit blockbuster was 'Iron Man', just like Johnny Depp's world popularity with Pirates; although they were brilliant before those movies in eyes of a true movie lovers. His performance as Kirk Lazarus, Australian, winner of 5 Oscars, that turned black for his new role, is one of the funniest roles in comedy ever. His appearance, attitude, accent and style is amazing and he should be the only reason why this movie should get a passing grade in eyes of those who disliked it (although I don't see the reasons why). To sum it all up, here we've got a great comedy coming from Ben Stiller, with memorable Robert Downey Jr.'s interpretation of Kirk Lazarus that will stay with you long after you finish watching this movie.",7,1,4,25 September 2008
No Country for Old Men," Brilliantly directed, even better acted
","Ethan and Joel Coen are officially back in action. After 'The Man Who Wasn't There' we all waited for another masterpiece ('Intolerable Cruelty' and 'The Ladykillers' are only solid) from productive Coens. But I'm happy that the waiting time is over; 'No Country for Old Men' is here and Coen's are better then ever. They decided to make a movie based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy and the whole movie is nominated for 8 Oscars.Story is about Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who goes out hunting and he founds lots of dead bodies, drugs and bag full of money near Rio Grande. Old sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) has to solve this case and on Llewelyn's way is also crazy killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who wants the money for himself.What is excellent in this movie? Well, I would say almost everything. Direction is perfect, with great shots and movements of camera. Also Coen's know how to make actors shine. Tommy Lee Jones (he's always brilliant), Josh Brolin (surprisingly good), Kelly Macdonald (great), Woody Harrelson (excellent short performance) and Barry Corbin (just like Harrelson) are staring in it. But there is one man that stands alone in this perfect cast: Javier Bardem. His last performance in 'Love in the Time of Cholera' is wooden, but here he surprised everyone. He trows coins (just like Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face), he's 100% crazy, 100% original and 100% brilliant. He represents ultimate evil in this movie. 'No Country for Old Men'. Title is very important and the first lines indicate what is this movie about: 'I always liked to hear about the old timers. Never missed a chance to do so. You can't help but compare yourself against the old timers. Can't help but wonder how they would've operated these times.' There is the importance of the whole story. Old sheriff Ed Tom Bell is surprised with the time that he lives in. Most important conversation is between Ed Tom and old Ellis. Ellis says that there's always been crimes and evil is always here. But they are too old to fight with it and that's why there is no country for old men - 'This country's hard on people, you can't stop what's coming, it ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity.' And also my favorite dialog (if you put aside all Bardem's ones) is the last lines between Ed Tom and his wife; when he's describing his dream (watch it carefully cause that is the last scene). Coen's are here and their movie is one of the top 10 this year. Masterpiece of a movie that you need to watch. I watched it twice and I want more. More of Bardem, more of Coen's and more of this spectacular movie that has hidden meaning. Cause 'No Country for Old Men' is not only a chase for Llewelyn Moss and bag of money or some pointless killing path of Anton Chigurh. No, that is not Coen's way of directing movies; 'No Country for Old Men' is intelligent and strong movie.",8,2,9,10 February 2008
The Transporter," Promising start but after-wards it fails do deliver more realistic action movie
","'The Transporter' defined Jason Statham as action star but I think he deserves better as we have all seen his great acting abilities in debut movies ('Lock, Stock...' and 'Snatch'). This movie really starts fine as we are introduced with Frank Martin, ex soldier, who is a mercenary 'transporter'. He moves goods from one place to another and he does it with no questions asked. So one day Frank breaks his own rules and he looks at the moving package. There he founds tied women. Of course he decides to help her...Entrance car chase as we watch what Frank is doing for living has resemblance with PirÃ¨s/Besson 'Taxi' scenes and the whole story is set in France also. There are also clear reference with movies like 'LÃ©on' or 'Ronin'. But never mind that, 'The Transporter' has obvious problems with reality, like lots of todays action movies. There are too many great explosions, our heroes special skills (drives with his feet, holds under truck at high speeds, bullets are not even wounding him...) and unbelievable acting from some actors (Matt Schulze is trying so hard to be bad that that is funny). There are some good fighting scenes with oil, on bus or at containers. Also Statham is good, Qi Shu pretty and FranÃ§ois BerlÃ©and is French Alan Rickman (they look very similar to me). To say long story short; good action, brainless fun with new action star Jason Statham!",5,0,0,10 May 2008
Seabiscuit," Wonderful story
","'Seabiscuit' is wonderful story about horse who changed the lives of three totally different people. Seabiscuit is the name of the horse who was smaller then all the others racing horses. That was the reason why his owner often beat him and treat him badly. But three people saw something in this horse. Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) and Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) are those people and all of them have their own reasons and stories. Charles Howard had tragedy in his life. After he got rich on selling cars, his young son dies in car accident and soon his wife leaves him. Charles founds another woman in his life and her name is Marcela and she pulls Charles back to life. Then Charles decided to buy a horse. His name was Seabiscuit and after that never was same again. Of course Charles had too find a trainer and a jockey so Seabiscuit could race. Charles hires Tom Smith as coach and Red Pollard as jockey. Tom Smith is a man that spend all his life caring about horses but what he never had is opportunity to show how good horse trainer is he. Charles gave him that chance but that would never happen without Seabiscuit. The most complicated character is Red Pollard. His poor parents left him to another man so he can take care of young Red. But they never contacted him after that. That is shallow for me in this movie. Father and mother never contacted their loving son and I think that this scene should be added. Red also got chance to prove himself, just like Tom and that was very good shown to us.Why this movie is good but not great to me? It's because of some 'deleted' scenes (Red parents calling their son...) and mostly because of not convincing acting of Tobey Maguire. Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and William H. Macy are great. So old school of actors did their job but young Maguire just couldn't do his. But even without Maguire's memorable role this movie is still very good and very warm story of life.",7,0,3,1 October 2007
The Number 23," 'Of course, time is just a counting system ... numbers with meaning attached to them - isn't it?'
","Well what to say after so many informations that we're given in only 98 minutes? I'll start with the fact that this is Joel Schumacher's 23rd project he directed (if we don't count two videos for INXS). Is that coincidence or not? Anyway, I want to tell you that I enjoyed in this movie very much. Maybe it's because I like movies like 'Secret Window', '1408' and similar stuff. I just like movies were you have to think for a change. Schumacher's 'The Number 23' leaves us with many questions through entire movie, except of course at the ending were everything is explained to us in simplicity that I happened to like. I liked the ending and I think that the whole movie wasn't boring like some comments said. It was unique and very good experience that is based on acting abilities of two actors: Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen. Carrey and Madsen aren't disappointing and this is perfect movie to watch weather one actor can or cannot act. They both passed this exam in my eyes, just like director Schumacher did. Really good thriller. Nothing scary, not a masterpiece but a good movie for all of you who are not afraid to use that gray thing in your head and extract hour and half of your time.",7,2,3,4 January 2008
Stardust," Fairytale, Predictable, Funny, De Niro
","If someone asks me to briefly describe 'Stardust' I would say fairytale, predictable, funny, De Niro. Let me explain you what these words means to me. Fairytale. It is obvious that this is fairytale. It has every element of it. Witches, stars, pirates, magic and everything else. Fairy tales are usually made for children, but I think that these stories are made for everyone who is not afraid to say that he still hasn't grown up completely; that he still has something childish left.Predictable. The whole story was too predictable to me. At the beginning I knew how everything is going to end and that isn't good. I like surprises but I couldn't found any in this movie. I also think that children will enjoy this movie more than teenagers and adults. Funny. Some scenes are funny and very cleverly made. Like the characters of Primus, Secundus (Rupert Everett is great) and all of the king's sons. I am aiming on their ghosts. That was very funny just like characters of Ferdy the Fence (Ricky Gervais), Guard (David Kelly), King (Peter O'Toole) and especially Billy - the goat (Mark Williams). Also I admire Ian McKellen because of his voice (he's narrator of the whole story). I'm just sad that he didn't show his brilliant acting abilities in these movie.De Niro. I left him out in section funny because he is story for himself. I think his character is simply great and all of his scenes are great. His appearance is my favorite part of the movie. For me he was very funny, although someone will think that he's only throwing away his reputation. But why don't we all just admire his scene when he wears women clothes and dance? I did.",4,3,13,1 October 2007
I Am Legend," 'I Am Legend' is working because of Will Smith
","Yesterday I watched 'I Am Legend' and I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised with few things. It's very hard to make apocalyptic movie, that is mostly based on one character, who fights with some nasty creatures. You have to make good special effects, you have to hire good actor and you have to make a good story so people could enjoy themselves. 'I Am Legend' succeeds on every single level because it's made on great book by Richard Matheson. Of course this is Hollywood blockbuster so the movie isn't completely true to the book, which bothers me the most. The genius story of the book is not totally transfered to the big screen and that can easily be seen in the ending (there is no happy ending for humanity as known) and in the little things that are very important (dog came to Neville on a different way). But if you put aside all those things, you have a story that is not boring for a minute, excellent shots of empty streets of New York and what's most important: Will Smith is brilliant. His role is very demanding and Smith takes it all on his back. Smith is emotional and strong at the same time, his role is believable and he again proved that he became top class actor. What to say then 'I Am Legend' is working because of Smith.",6,0,3,26 January 2008
Shrek 2," For all generations
","'Shrek 2' is excellent movie and in my opinion even better then the first one. This movie is so innovative, warm and brilliant. And also very funny. The whole story is great and for a sequel this is masterpiece. We all know how sequels can disappoint.Directors did their job very well and all characters look like they are alive. Well known actors gave their voices to the characters. Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everett, Jennifer Saunders. All of them were great. But I have to specially congratulate Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas. Murphy is excellent and he continues to shine as Donkey. Antonio Banderas is new. His character Puss In Boots is my favorite. So new, fresh and cleverly made.Very important: don't believe to those who say this movie is for children. This movie is for all generations. For all of you who didn't forgot that they were children once. For those who forgot that, allow Shrek to refresh your memory.",10,1,2,9 June 2007
The Dark Knight," 'The night is darkest just before the dawn. And I promise you, the dawn is coming.'
","I went on premiere of new Batman here in Croatia and as soon as I came home I wanted to write a comment about this one. The reason is obvious; I wanted to be able to write all what I need to say now, when I'm still 'fresh' and under impression of this great movie. Although my favorite director is Tim Burton and his way of presenting Gotham City is still my favorite, I must say that this is the best Batman movie made. It is way better even from the last Nolan's Batman. My respect to Mr. Nolan goes way back to his first movie, and till today that man doesn't have a stain on his career. Not only that his movies are OK, but they are great and he really enriches world of movies. So that is all about Nolan, cause I'm eager to talk about the movie.What I liked is well made story that will surely keep you awake right till the end (even though the movie is long - 152 minutes). I admit that at first I was bit skeptic about Joker entering in the Batman series again. For a long time Jack Nicholson had no competition and no one really dared to think about playing Joker. Not until now. Late Heath Ledger had guts to show the world what Joker is like. He created his own Joker, different from Nicholson, but equally or even more brilliant. You see, Nicholson has that 'crazy' face and smile and Ledger had to start from nothing. Sadly, one brilliant actor is not with us today but he will always live through his movies. The role of Joker made him world wide known (even to not movie or Batman fans) and in my opinion took his life. It would be a shame if Academy decides not to give him honor in a figure of nomination for Best Supporting actor, at least.Every character in this movie is shown to us right to the bones. Bruce Wayne (Batman) is presented as hero, that is also only human (that's what I liked about Batman in general - he is only human, with no special powers, only gadgets). Human who acts by the emotions but hero who will take the responsibility on his back and became object of hate because he is the strongest. Not machine, but human. Christian Bale is only solid, cause he is out shined by Ledger and Eckhart (same thing happened to Keaton in very first Batman with Nicholson). Aaron Eckhart is another actor who shines here as Harvey Dent (Two-Face). His character is the most complex one in entire movie cause he became something that he despised - a criminal. Personal tragedy created lunatic from him who lets coin to decide if someone is going to be killed or spared. Acting and evolving of Eckhart/Dent is brilliant and for every price (specially one to screenplay writers - brothers Nolan). Women, Rachel Dawes, who makes love interest for both Dent and Wayne is played by Maggie Gyllenhaal. It is a great choice, over Katie Holmes from 'Batman Begins', because Maggie is so natural actress that is great to watch her on screen and her character is the tragic one (I would say more then the ones of Wayne and Dent). Lt. James Gordon is played by great Gary Oldman with enough emotions that makes his character believable (specially last scenes with his family). Screen legends, Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman, are given smaller but very important roles. Caine as Alfred, Wayne's conscience and Freeman as Lucius, inventor and friend. Although the atmosphere of Nolan's Gotham is not as dark as Burton's, Nolan's characters are darker and stylish and in all that dark there is light at the end; people on those two ferries showed that even though there is lots of suffering and evil on this world (in Gotham), that when it comes down everyone can be united in life or death - that is also a great victory over Joker who never thought that that kind of scenario will happen. Everything is described in words of H.Dent: 'The night is darkest just before the dawn. And I promise you, the dawn is coming.'At the end, I will also add that this movie has some parts not explained till the end (like Scarecrow's appearance for only a minute or what happened to Joker - he stayed alive so some other actor would take Ledger's place; not like original script were Joker dies). Probably that is all done because of Ledger's death. But all in all, this is a must see movie for everyone and I'll give it the highest grade. Not because I think this is the greatest movie of all time (like IMDb list says) but because this is the best Batman movie and great idea that came alive by great director, actors, writers and all who worked on this special movie. Thank you all!",9,3,8,24 July 2008
Taken," Let Liam Neeson take you into 'Taken'!
","'Taken' is not another stupid action thriller of B production with bad actors and low budget; 'Taken' is what modern action thriller should look like, written by Luc Besson, directed by Pierre Morel and brilliantly acted by one and only Liam Neeson. Neeson brings completely new approach to his character and proves that you don't need to have tons of muscles to be an action star (he's 56 remember!!); he has the height, style, approach, in one word: he's cool! Above everything he is a great actor and he proves that once again. I could go on and on talking about Neeson but I want to say a few things about this movie. Following path of revenge Besson takes us on a ride that is full of action and the whole story is told in beautiful simplicity. It doesn't present nothing new, but the way the whole movie was filmed, with amazing action scenes (some of them brutal like electricity torture) and great actor in main role, you gotta' be satisfied with final outcome. And yes, you know that he's going to save everyone but then again Seagal also saves everyone but 95% of his movies are stupid. That is the magic of this movie cause Besson didn't present anything new. You just need to have passable script, good, young director, be European and have good actor in main role. All I can say, just let Liam Neeson take you into 'Taken'!",7,2,4,7 January 2009
The Descent," Six women, one cave, plenty of nasty creatures and lots of blood, well why not?
","I heard lots of positive comments for this one, so I decided to take a look. Why? Cause I like horror movies. My expectations were low cause it's been a while since I watched a really good horror movie of newer date. So I sat to watch this movie on my computer, all alone, in the dark. 'The Descent' starts like any other movie and actually in the first 50 minutes (without nasty creatures) we are meeting all the characters involved in this movie. Six women who all love dangerous adventures, like rafting on wild rivers (beginning), climbing on high mountains (that picture) and finally going into caves. So our six ladies decide to go to this cave not knowing what might be in there. They all agreed to go on a trip because of Sarah, who had a terrible road accident a year ago in which she lost her husband and daughter. Sarah needs change and all other characters need adrenaline so the adventure can begin. But Juno, the bravest of them all, decides to lead them into cave that no one went in before.Neil Marshall directed this one after the success of 'Dog Soldiers' and he's a classic example for the fact that good horrors could be made even if you don't have extravagant budget. What Marshall brings in new in his movie is great way of telling a story. First he starts slowly so he can introduce characters. Accident that happened to Sarah, friendship between Sarah, Juno and Beth and finally preparations for the trip. When they finally come into the cave strange things doesn't start to happen quickly. And then blast. Marshall hits us with that creatures, music, atmosphere and on top of all, with his directing. It is absolutely amazing how Marshall manged to film all that scenes in dark. Most of the movie happens in a cave and there isn't many light but Marshall succeeds on that field and he proves that one European horror can easily beat all those new American crappy horrors (there are few exceptions). Maybe at one point you will find this movie to bloody, that everything that happens to main characters lacks sense but I think that you can either like or dislike this movie. There is no middle. One thing you have to admit: directing was great, atmosphere was fine and gives you plenty of room to think about it. From Juno's accidental killing of one of the characters to the very end when Sarah stays alone in the cave and when she creates the picture of her dead daughter; and of course was Sarah to cruel to Juno. My favorite part was the ending, cause it was simply great to watch Sarah's dream and then the reality. This is nothing new but it's a great way to end this movie.Universal message of this movie is that evil cannot be destroyed and that caver is not a good profession, at least not in a cave that no man visited before. Or it did, but they stayed there forever!",7,1,3,3 January 2008
The Fountain," Be patient with this movie and please think about it
","When I set to write something about this movie I had only one dilemma; is it going to be short or massive comment. I decided to be as short as I can, cause words can hardly describe what I feel. Maybe just one word: unique. Unique on many levels; writing ,acting, music... Sound background fits perfectly in this story telling and the acting of Hugh Jackman & Rachel Weisz is amazing. I knew that Weisz is good actress, but this is movie where Jackman became a real actor. This is so heavy role and Jackman done it nearly with perfection. Something about the script; movie follows three stories. Each one from the past, present, and future - conquistador in Mayan country searches for the tree of life to free his captive queen; medical researcher, working with various trees, looks for a cure that will save his dying wife; a space traveler, traveling with an aged tree encapsulated within a bubble. My understandings (don't read any more if you haven't watched it): The only story that is really happening is the one that takes place in present. Story from the future presents Tommy and that tree. Probably you've all realized that Izzi is actually that tree, cause when she dies, tree dies too. Story from the past is search for eternal life, actually Tommy's search for cure that would save Izzi. At the end Tommy dies in future and past. In future to bring life to that tree that presents his everlasting love to Izzi and in past where he dies and fails to save Spain and live happily ever after with Queen (Izzi). In the present Izzi couldn't be saved but the whole story leaves us bright hope that Tommy will find cure and he says: 'Death is a disease, it's like any other. And there's a cure. A cure - and I will find it.' At the end, this is a big comment. Sorry, I got carried away. But I didn't changed my mind regarding this movie. Really superb piece of art that will have negative reviews only from those who couldn't understand this beautiful movie or from those who simply don't want to use brain to interpret this story.",8,5,9,27 March 2008
Love Actually," Actually...excellent
","Well this movie is actually...excellent. It includes lots of characters who are all in love in their own special way and the whole story is set in London five weeks before Christmas. We meet Billy Mack (Bill Nighy), old singer who tries to get back on top with help of his loyal manager Joe (Gregor Fisher); David (Hugh Grant) has just become the new Prime Minister and he instantly falls in love with his new personal assistant Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); Karen (Emma Thompson) and Harry (Alan Rickman) are married couple with their own problems; Sarah (Laura Linney) is women torn between a man she loves and her sick brother; Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (Keira Knightley) are fresh married, but Peter's best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) is in love with Juliet; John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) met on shooting of porn movie; Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) moves to France after he found out that his girl is cheating him with his brother and there he meets Aurelia (LÃºcia Moniz), young Portuguese woman; Colin Frissell (Kris Marshall) hopes that he'll find 'normal' girl(s) in America; and finally there is Sam (Thomas Sangster), who is young boy and also in love, which makes a problem to his stepfather Daniel (Liam Neeson).So many characters and so many actors that are beautifully composed in this movie. All that is achieved Richard Curtis in his directorial debut. His story is for everyone. I think that lots of people could find themselves in this characters that are full of life and very real. Maybe the only characters that are little stretched are the ones of John and Judy. It's hard to believe that porn actors are so shy like they are both presented. But here Curtis makes fun with everything. That's why I love Britons so much. They smile to others equally as they smile to themselves. 'Love Actually' rises above many romantic movies because it has great story, capable direction, top class actors and magnificent soundtrack mixed with some old and some new songs. I really can't talk about all the actors in this movies cause it would last for days; instead I'll mention only two: Bill Nighy and Emma Thompson. Nighy brings breath of fresh air to his character while he's making fun with his manager, his own hit song and Britney Spears. Emma Thompson, ah Emma Thompson. She makes acting so easy, makes you feel that anyone could act. She's so natural and believable, such extraordinary actress. There is also lots of cameo roles (Billy Bob Thornton, Claudia Schiffer, Denise Richards, Sienna Guillory...) and one hilarious appearance of Rowan Atkinson as jewelery salesman (he's like Christmas ghost, you know when he helps young Sam).Well, I almost forgot to say what is this movie about (at least how I understand it). It gives us a message; that we must search and struggle for love, we must make sacrifice, just like Jamie and Sam for example did, while Sarah choose the other way (her brother) and she gave up. Actually everything is said in the beginning; there is enough love on this world (great idea with airport arrivals). Actually, I advice you to watch this movie. Actually, I gave 10 to it, cause it's so much better then any other romantic movie I've ever watched. Or I could just say, love actually.",8,18,31,16 March 2008
Joker," Who's laughing now?
","Modern America is like Murray show where opinions are created for greater masses & every difference is looked upon with contempt. Such is mindless campaign to boycott a movie because it will provoke violence in a country where gun can be bought while shopping for groceries.Joker is examination of people's behavior towards those in need, sick individuals who are pushed to the margins just because they need help. While city is choking in garbage, funds are being cut on social help & medical care, elite in suits are smiling while watching Chaplin. Wayne is not different then the others and he's finally given human approach rather then all good hero that tried to save Gotham in all other creations.There are no heroes in this movie, there is no light at the end of tunnel & there is no sympathy for titular character but rather a big punch in the face from Todd Phillips to all of us who are actually living in our own Murray show day in day out without ever taking time to reflect what surrounds us.Joker is a must see movie that will make you think about times we live in, about our role in the system & the ones on top never liked ordinary thinking people. Burton took his Joker straight from comics as he fell in acid, but Phillips only needed to put his protagonist in today's world.So who's laughing now?",10,6,10,8 October 2019
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Intelligent and funny action movie
","From the first Die Hard movie I was looking for worthy sequel. And I found it. 'Die Hard 3' is definitely my favorite Die Hard movie after the first movie. It is also obvious that it's impossible to compare first movie with the others, but director John McTiernan (director of first Die Hard) found a recipe to make another good movie. And that is 'Die Hard 3' in my books. I didn't like 'Die Hard 2' mostly because of bad casting and totally impossible situations. 'Die Hard 3' is opposite of that. We've got brilliant Jeremy Irons as bad guy and one big surprise: Samuel L. Jackson. Why surprise? Because Jackson really astonished me with the way he acted with Willis. Their team work is amazing and that is one of the reasons why this movie is so successful. There are lots of very funny situations where they are arguing about something. From Willis entry into Harlem with that sign to their driving in old Yugo car. I just loved all that. Also there aren't lots of impossible situations. Like that battle on the wing of the plane in second part. Actually there aren't any situations that are out of ordinary in this movie. All of that you can swallow. What can I say more; only that I love this movie and I will always find positive word to describe it.",8,0,0,20 September 2007
American Gangster," Story of Frank Lucas
","Based on a true story, 'American Gangster' tells us the story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) who becomes most important importer of heroin on Manhattan, after the death of his mentor Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III). Lucas does that by buying heroin directly from the source in South East Asia and that is his cousin Nate (Roger Guenveur Smith). His product is superior to the one that is currently available on the street and his prices are lower. His alliance with the New York Mafia ensures his position and he also has to bribe some cops, especially Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin). Parallel with the story of Frank Lucas we also follow the story of Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), who seems to be only honest policeman.Ridley Scott directed this movie and I have to say that everything is made very good but I have a feeling that original version had 4 hours (just took one number) and that he had to cut a lot of scenes. There Scott gets lost, cause on one side he managed to create character of Frank Lucas completely and that is great, but on the other side almost every other characters suffer (especially Richie Roberts). And everything is perfectly made for Washington, but Crowe hasn't got much space to show his acting ability (which are great). Also some situations aren't explained completely. Like why is Cuba Gooding's character so little in this movie, after fight with Lucas he disappears. But what bothered me the most is that Lucas family just came to this big, new house without asking any questions. How did he get all that money and it is simply impossible that in his family, in short period of time, they all became killers and drug sellers. But if I put aside these things, we get one very well directed and acted movie (especially Washington) about a man who managed to became the king of drug scene and he wasn't Italian, but black. Also the character of Crowe is definitely only completely positive one (but only if we look his career in police). So 'American Gangster' is solid movie from director Ridley Scott, but it isn't his best in my opinion. 'Gladiator' is still my number one, but 'American Gangster' isn't movie to avoid for every Scott fan.",6,1,2,23 December 2007
Shooter," Mixture of movies we all watched before
","In the lack of truly good action movies, 'Shooter' makes a little difference because it is mostly intelligent, fast and easy to watch. Of course this movie has problems and this is definitely not the best of its genre, but Fuqua provides us good fun through entire movie with universal message that something is wrong in America. And not only in America, in every state you can find corruption on the top, but America is too big and always juicy to talk about. Why? Because of its external politic to other lands (mostly). That issue is represented in this movie (conversation between Wahlberg and Serbedzija is great), but it also has something that bothered me. The ending. You cannot just walk in the house and do what he did (senator!!!). If this was reality, Wahlberg's character would be a killer and not a hero in eyes of viewer. Here Fuqua mix what is right and what is wrong and here he presents his rage about the current position America is in. He did that by giving us the mixture of movies we all watched before. 'The Fugitive' (Wahlberg is wrongfully accused just like Ford), 'Assassins' (church tower where the rifle is), 'Rambo' (setting up the bombs) and lot more action movies were our main hero manages to kill all his enemies, even when he is outnumbered. And it all works out very well because of Wahlberg. He really can pass for action hero. Danny Glover and Ned Beatty are bad guys and Rade Serbedzija gives us very believable performance too. Most beautiful part of this movie is Rhona Mitra and there is also Kate Mara in it. So, Fuqua managed to make a solid movie. This is certainly not his best but it is recommendable to watch for all action fans.",6,1,4,15 January 2008
1408," Once you get in, there is no getting out
","I'm Stephen King fan and I'm also a movie fan, so it's perfect for me to watch King's books or short stories on big screen. Everything started with 'The Shining' and then continued with 'Secret Window' after all these years. My interest for King's books is very high and everything I read so far is good. I have to also admit that I've never read '1408' but I certainly will one day.To me sometimes is better to watch a movie and then read a book, because you don't know how everything is going to end. That's why I liked '1408' and it has this King's genius touch. Only he can think of story like this.The story is about writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack), who is writing about supernatural things, and and he receives a postcard with the hotel name and the number of the room. Enslin wants to go into that room although he read about all those people who died and also hotel manager Mr. Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) begs him not to do that. But Enslin is determined to go anyway. This movie starts excellent, fast and gripping with lots of information to viewers. But in the middle gets a little lost but it repays at the end. Ah, that ending. Left me with so much questions. Was everything that happened to Enslin real? Yes it is. He has conversation with his dead daughter on tape. Is this possible? In King's world yes it is. But what is he trying to say with that ending? How I understood he wanted to say that there is connection with this world and world after death. That connection is only possible in room 1408 because Enslin managed to hold and talk to his dead daughter. But why did all those people died in this room and Enslin stayed alive? Again my explanation is that all other people were weak and they cracked, but Enslin says in one scene something like I will stay alive or if I'm going down I'm taking you (room) with me - when he starts fire. Enslin realized that he has to fight if he wants to stay alive, he didn't gave up although he could (that scene when there are ropes in the room so he can hang himself). But what is really brilliant is King's mind. He started from thing that is so basic - that all hotel rooms are creepy places: '... Just think, how many people have slept in that bed before you? How many of them were sick? How many... died?'. So briefly, '1408' is gripping horror-thriller that will keep your attention right till the end. Swed HÃ¥fstrÃ¶m made very good adaptation of King's story and I also liked Cusack in this role. You will definitely think throughout and probably be scared in some scenes. I highly recommend this movie to all King's fans and to all others who never read any of his books. Just watch it and then write a comment how you understood this title.",7,0,0,1 November 2007
Iron Man," Everybody is talking about Robert Downey Jr. now. Finally!!!
","Robert Downey Jr. is one of those actors who can offer a lot more then he's given chances to prove himself (like Matt Damon). It's mostly because of his drug and alcohol problems but no one cannot deny that he's an outstanding actor who never acted in big budget movies. Not until now. Now he's Iron Man and his career suddenly blossom. Sadly you have to act in well accepted blockbusters to became widely known and appreciated actor. People didn't think of Johnny Depp as big star until 'Pirates' (of course there are few of us who are his loyal fans since 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' or 'Cry-Baby'). So, I really can say that Robert Downey Jr. is type of actor I like since I saw him in 'Chaplin'. But lets concentrate on this movie and not on right or wrong sides of Hollywood A-list actors.Based on Marvel comic 'Iron Man' is a story about Tony Stark, a wealthy industrialist and master engineer who builds a powered exoskeleton so he can escape from people who are holding him in captive. They want from Tony to build them a Jericho missile, like the one his company is being creating. Soon, Tony escapes and he decides to modify his design so he can help the world.Jon Favreau was obviously given a lot of money and he invested it wisely. Although I'm not a fan of blockbusters this one as a movie is a good one. Comic is successfully brought to life. 'Iron Man' has its holes, like not so convincing start but everything since the time Stark returned from his captivity is good and entertaining story. As I said before Downey Jr. is a thing this movie needs, just like always excellent Jeff Bridges in role of Obadiah Stane. In this cast I didn't like Gwyneth Paltrow. She acted terrible. She's obviously not into acting and as I read, the only reason she accepted this role is that filming was close to her house and her children. Oh and Clark Gregg has that plastic face and everybody was laughing at him in the cinema (how did he stayed alive in the movie when Iron Monger strikes at his fellow agents???) So 'Iron Man' is good for fun and as blockbuster that would fill cinemas, but for a place in 250 best movies, I think not. I don't want to talk about some views of American politics in this movie (like the one that Stark shows when he's destroying his weapon that they sold to other countries). I will just say that that could happen only on movie. So at the end, I hope you'll enjoy in this movie and too all the critics - this movie is made for people who wants to have fun, and you mostly cannot talk about Hollywood blockbusters as movie masterpieces (there are very few exceptions of course). So my advice is to take 'Iron Man' for what it is. Just a good movie and solid fun for everyone.",7,1,2,14 May 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," You get what you expect
","After big summer hits like Pirates 3, Spider-Man 3 and Shrek 3, now it's time to go on with number four hit; and that is 'Live Free or Die Hard'(Die Hard 4.0). My personal favorite are still Pirates but also I can't say that I'm disappointed with this movie because John McClane is back.Plot is about our hero, John McClane (Bruce Willis) who fights against Internet-based terrorist organization. McClane's first job is to save young hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long). With problems on work John has also problems with his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead ) because there isn't any real communication between them.Action movies, like 'Die Hard' series, all have basically same plot. One man is out there alone and somehow he manages to save everyone, including himself. It isn't important whether our hero is on a building, plane or just on streets but what is important is how the whole movie is made. First 'Die Hard' is still untouchable and best of series. 'Die Hard 4' is somewhere in range of the third movie, pushing the second movie on last position. Maybe everything is made better then in a third movie but I just like that movie with Jeremy Irons and Samuel L. Jackson as co-stars. On the other hand fourth movie started from nothing and obviously producers decided not to take any big and famous names in this project. They already have Willis and they decided to cast young, promising actors (Justin Long, Timothy Olyphant, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Maggie Q). I agree with that decision because I think that all of them did good job. Especially Justin Long who really surprised me. He acted very good in role of young, scared hacker. Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis and he's so confident in this role. Another good one for Willis who really needed this after few years of 'non hit' movies (period from 'The Sixth Sense' to 'Sin City'). But don't worry about Willis cause he's really someone you can call movie star. If producers had 100 million dollars (I just took one number), they decided to gave 20 to Willis, 10 for other actors and director and everything else in action scenes. Direction of this one was given to young Len Wiseman (only 'Underworld' series) and he did a good job in putting lots of action scenes in the plot. He really stayed loyal, to other movies of the series, on number of action during the movie and that is a good thing.Everything I talked about so far was good sides of this movie but as any other this one has it's bad sides. It is mostly making the impossible possible. For me impossible is for a man to jump out of a running car, to jump on a plane, to survive fall from great heights, to survive all those bullets who are meant for him. And after everything, he can run again like nothing happened until the last scene where he sits on the floor longer then usually. He even shot himself but hey, that's John McClane. I always watch that realistic side in every movie and I can understand that jumping out of car became normal but I just can't pass over some things. When I'm saying this I don't mean only about this movie but to all those movies who are making things like this possible to a normal man (John McClane is human and not some Terminator or Jack Sparrow adventure character).Putting everything together all I can say is that mostly I enjoyed in this movie and for me this is good action movie. Just turn off that realistic point of view and maybe you'll find this movie excellent. There is some good acting and some really good special effects that are important sides of this movie and I recommend this one to everyone who want good action movie. You'll probably get what you expect. I did.",5,3,5,3 August 2007
Apollo 13," Howard's glorification of America
","Watched 'Apollo 13' again last night and I have totally different points of view now, then I had back then (maybe 8 or more years ago). I set to watch 'Apollo 13' with only a memory that that was a good movie. Now after all this years, I must say that I'm little disappointed. Looking at the whole picture, this is solid movie, with very good cast and some interesting moments. But nothing more. What bothered me the most is the length of this movie. It just goes on and on (it's because the movie goes on very slow). And another thing; Ron Howard's presentation of how America is great and special country. Back then people weren't send to space primarily to explore; it was a race between America and Russia. So after America's success, other mission were send in space, like Apollo 13 (to explore;in this case Moon). Apollo 13 crew will be remembered as the lucky ones. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert (he replaced Ken Mattingly) were on board and they managed to stay alive because of great help they had back on Earth. From constellation of great actors in this movie (Hanks, Bacon, Sinise,...), my vote goes to Ed Harris. He's great as Gene Kranz, chief of the operation. This is definitely not Howard's best movie or a movie that should be watched by all means, but if you love any of these actors and you can separate 140 minutes of your life; go ahead and watch it. Oh, and of course if you are American, you will feel good.",6,3,8,24 February 2008
Atonement," Beautiful but sad story
","When I went to the cinema I expected one solid drama with Keira Knightley in a leading role. But instead I walked out of the cinema with that feeling when you know that you just watched one hell of movie. Ian McEwan's novel is brought to life in this great movie about love, actually about love story of Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis. Cecilia's younger sister Briony wrongfully accuses Robbie for raping her cousin Lola. Briony's strong imagination pulls many events in the future as Robbie ends up in prison and Cecilia losses her love of life. Briony's misunderstanding leads to a terrible crime whose consequences follow them through World War II.After 'Pride & Prejudice', director Joe Wright decided to make another movie that is based on a book and this one is a winner and quite possibly the winner of Oscar for Best Picture in the next year. 'Atonement' gives us few strong performances but James McAvoy steals the show. That scene in the house when Briony visits Cecilia and Robbie is great. Saoirse Ronan shows great potential, Keira Knightley isn't long in this movie but she's good as usual and Vanessa Redgrave is excellent as older Briony. But what really amazed me is how Wright tells us this story in beautiful simplicity, with returning in the past but never leaves the viewer with questions cause he presents all the answers. One scene is amazing and that is when Robbie comes to the beach with his fellow soldiers. Really breathtaking and spectacular scene, cause 'Atonement' is one beautiful but sad story and it is really shame to miss it, so go and watch one of top 10 movies in this year.",9,8,14,24 December 2007
