First Man," Excellent biopic of Neil Armstrong
","Ryan Gosling delivers a superb performance, with quiet intensity, as Neil Armstrong during the Gemini and then Apollo space programs leading up to the Apollo 11 mission which first put man on the moon.This is the best space non-fiction drama, since Apollo 13 and The Right Stuff. However what is different about it, is that the focus is not on the missions but on Neil himself.It follows the sacrifice and loss experienced by Armstrong both professionally and personally, and Claire Foy is outstanding as his wife. An emotionally charged woman, married to a man of few words, who is not great at expressing his own feelings.The movie is gripping, and provides an outstanding insight into one mans perspective on one of mankind's most breath taking achievements.",9,1,1,4 January 2020
The Irishman," The Irishman - Scorsese back to his best genre...
","This film is brilliant, but by no means perfect.It feels like a cross between Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America' and Martin Scorsese's most famous film, 'Goodfellas'. However, it doesn't have the beauty almost operatic quality of Once Upon a Time in America, or the stylised panache of Goodfellas.There are some epics out there of a similar run time, where the time flies by without you looking at your watch. In the Irishman, there are definitely moments that lag, and feel a little slow, maybe if it was 45mins shorter it would pack more punch.The film doesn't have the zip or magnetism of other Scorsese outings, despite the story being a compelling non-fiction tale of Mafia hitman Frank Sheeran, and involves one of the most famous 'whodunit's' in US history, in the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. (which is exciting source material).However, the production quality is incredibly high, with vintage vehicles, clothes, absolutely spot on. The editing spliced with an incredible contemporary soundtrack, is trademark Scorsese. The cast is phenomenal, and every single one of them delivers a captivating performance in scene after scene. Great performers, delivering at their very best!If you only ever watch it once, it's definitely worth the time!",8,3,6,2 December 2019
Midnight in Paris," Very cute whimsical love story in Paris!
","One of Woody Allen's best. This film is a love story to Paris and to the Artistic community who found themselves ensconced there in the 1920's.The story concept, about a writer being transported to the 1920's where his idols are currently enjoying nights on the town...when the clock strikes midnight, does feel a little like Cinderella in reverse, but it is very well executed!The music, the cinematography, everything is designed to show Paris at its very best! It is a very cute feel good romcom, and whilst delivering the comedy with his trademark whimsical style, he still manages to deliver the salient point of the movie. Don't look back on the rose tinted past, appreciate the present for what it is....or something to that effect!I'd happily watch this repeatedly!",9,0,0,10 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Not mind-blowing, but a solid end to the Saga!
","Ending the epic 9 part Skywalker saga was never going to be easy, and under the circumstances JJ Abrams does an admirable job!The movie won't win any awards, the plot was quite simplistic and the narrative was light. Focusing too much on big visuals, and pace...not enough on the emotional bonds between the main characters, which is what made the original trilogy so appealing.It did however manage to tie up all the loose ends, linking back to the original trilogy and had some wonderful nostalgic nods. If you are a fan of the Star Wars universe it does end in a very satisfying way!",8,6,16,4 January 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," It's Spider-Man, but not as we know it...
","A surprisingly original entry into the Spider-Man canon, that will hold its own against all the Marvel outings being churned our currently.Does a great job of creating a genuine origin story, set within an already existing and well known landscape, and pays homage to the pre-existing Spider-Man world with aplomb.Gives the different 'spider men / girl' enough air time without removing the focus from the main character, and has some nice plot twists (albeit predictable).Animation is very good, slightly different but the way it's done enhances the bright colours and craziness of the Multi-Verse. All in all a fun family film, highly recommended.",9,0,0,15 September 2019
Yesterday," Yesterday...cute comedy, with great music!
","Yesterday is a nice little film, which centers on struggling musician Jack, and his evolving relationship with his best friend / manager, Ellie.The dynamic of their relationship, and their eventual coupling, are very much in keeping with Richard Curtis' other RomCom work; Love Actually, Notting Hill, Four Weddings & A Funeral etc.To that end, it is a little predictable in parts, however it is very funny, has some unique quirks, cameos, and acts as a tremendous vehicle for the Beatles back catalogue. The very best sort of 'easy watching' film, still great after repeat viewings!",7,0,0,6 January 2020
Toy Story 4," A nice addition to the original trilogy!
","Toy Story 3 ended in such a well rounded way, with Andy having grown up and the toys being given to a young Bonnie. Any additional film in the series was always going to be more of a stand alone...With Toy Story 4 that is certainly the case. Whilst the story does follow a few of the typical Toy Story themes (i.e - lost toy needing to be saved, a new toy that may not be as friendly as first thought) it is really Woody's story. The other toys, even Buzz, don't really feature anywhere near as much as in previous outings.The introduction of a some new toys is well done, with a lot of laughs and feel good comic relief, typical of the Toy Story franchise. There is also the return of a previous favourite who has a strong impact on Woody's journey in more ways than one.As always the story is nuanced in a way which makes it incredibly fun for the younger viewers, but also plays to the older crowd. In that regard the film does touch on some mature themes, such as, the ability to change and move on when your life no longer has the same core purpose, and it's never too late to have a second chance at love.The animation from Pixar is absolutely fantastic, their best work yet with incredible detail evident in every frame. Overall, it is a familiar and enjoyable feel good experience. Like an old hoodie, it's relaxing, comfortable, and makes you feel warm and fuzzy on the inside.",8,0,4,30 June 2019
The Favourite," The Favourite - but not everyone's...
","This film divides opinion and rightly so. It is a film about not very much, in a historical period that is not widely covered (The end of Queen Anne's reign, she was the last ruler from the Royal House of Stuart). However, it is a bizarre, funny and entertaining dark comedy.The period costumes rightly deserve their Academy Award and the historical locations used for filming are wonderful. The three lead actresses are absolute powerhouses any one of those three could have won the best actress Oscar!The music is unsettling and makes you fear that something awful will happen at every turn, but with the backdrop of politics, favouritism and manipulation it does work and holds your attention throughout.The dialogue is snappy and there are moments of genuine hilarity. Often it concerns the absurdity of court life, but there are also some funny slapstick moments.The ending was ambiguous and leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied, but it shouldn't detract from what is a wonderful work of art. (The first thing I did after watching it was go on Wikipedia and read about the real life historical figures...fascinating).",8,3,6,14 November 2019
1941," A rare Spielberg miss....
","Long story short, this film isn't great! Great cast, great direction...but it just falls flat. The story is ridiculous, which isn't a problem but the dialogue and the acting from usually fantastic performers is very hamfisted!The film has potential but never reaches it. In summary, swing and a miss!",5,0,2,7 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon A Time...Tarantino's take on classic Hollywood!
","I've seen all of QT's movies and I've thoroughly enjoyed every single one of them. Once Upon a Time In Hollywood was no exception.The dialogue was snappy, the soundtrack was spot on, and the cinematic landscape and scene setting was as detailed as you would expect. The leads in the primary storyline were great, Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt were excellent as two ageing buddies trying to adapt to the changing world around them. The movie at times pays so much tribute to the golden age of Hollywood it feels like a blend of a Tarantino and a Coen brothers movie. (which can't be a bad thing).The late 60's aesthetic is enhanced by the appearance of real-life characters; Bruce Lee on the studio back lot, and then at the Playboy Mansion during a party sequence, Mama Cass, and Steve McQueen amongst others joining Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski. True to form there are a number of QT favourites making cameo appearances; Mike Madsen, Kurt Russell, Uma Thurman's daughter Maya Hawke, and Bruce Dern are examples. Otherwise there are cameos galore, my favourite supporting roles being Al Pacino's movie producer Marvin Schwartz, and Margaret Qualley's Charles Manson follower 'Pussycat'. (Qualley is another Hollywood 2nd generation cutting their teeth).Tarantino is at his best when he is writing original work, although as with Inglorious Basterds, he did show he can incorporate an alternative historical timeline to great effect. That is the intention of 'Once Upon a Time...' with the climax of the movie taking an alternate view on what could have happened if the Manson Murders had been aimed at fictional characters Rick Dalton and his stuntman Cliff Booth, instead of Sharon Tate and friends.The film does have problems though, the story feels a little thin and lacks the depth of previous Tarantino outings. Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate as an angelic figure, and as such spends most of the movie just smiling and looking happy, filled with innocence without adding any further complexity to the character. The Manson gang are introduced in the form of a group of wandering homeless looking disciples dumpster diving for food. When Cliff later gets to meet them properly at Spahn Ranch, the only one that the viewer has had any real connection to is Pussycat.Yet, when we come to the climax of the movie and the Manson members attack Rick, Cliff, and Rick's Wife...Pussycat is not there, the only Manson member we would remember is 'Tex', the horse riding second in command, but again there's no real connection to him other than remembering who he is. As a result the ending does lack a bit of punch,That being said, the ending does have some great comedic moments, mixed in with an expected level of blood and violence. It still manages to tie together elements of the story, with a class ending shot which is straight out of the 1960's. By anyone's standards it is a strong movie, but compared to Tarantino's standards, it is a little off the mark. However, would I watch it again? Yes, I absolutely would!!",8,9,19,26 August 2019
1917," Visual yet haunting masterpiece!
","A relatively simple story, 2 men have to get a message across enemy lines to stop a battalion from advancing into a trap on April 6th 1917 during World War 1.However the one shot structure, brings you right into the trenches with them, and you get to witness all the small changes in facial expressions, that convey far more accurately than words how they are feeling as they face unusual and daunting circumstances.The cinematography is exceptional, as is the recreation of the trenches and no-mans land. There is almost constant tension throughout the film, which keeps you on your seat just expecting something awful to happen to our characters at every turn.A fantastic depiction of the chaos of war and the cheapness with which human life can be discarded and at the same time, the huge efforts that can be taken to preserve it. It has certainly reignited my interest in the history of the First World War, and will be reading up on it ASAP!A triumph, well worth seeing, you won't be disappointed!",9,7,10,19 January 2020
The King," The King - slow, beautiful and compelling!
","This Netflix adaption, based on Shakespeare's 'Henry V', follows a reluctant Prince's ascension to becoming King Henry V of England, where he strives to unify the country and resolve domestic difference's, and ultimately lead his united country to victory in France, claiming the French crown.The musical score, and TimothÃ©e Chalamet's 'Hal / King Henry', are both dark, brooding, slow and intense. The movie echoes the same feeling, building slowly until the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.The cast are superb throughout, (Robert Pattinson as the Dauphin is hilarious!), and the dialogue is excellent, not a word is wasted. The movie does have a slow pace to it focusing often on Henry's isolation at the top, and at times gets a little bit lost whilst trying to maintain thoughtful tension, which comes across as a little flat.However, the camera work, and production quality do make up for any shortcomings, and what you are looking at is a work of art.",7,1,4,22 November 2019
The Untouchables," The Untouchables, touches great cinematic heights!
","Brian De Palma found massive success with Scarface, so it is fitting that he here covers a story about the taking down of real life gangster Al Capone who was once known by that name.The film focuses on Eliot Ness and his small squad of 'Untouchables' who went after Al Capone's bootlegging business in the late twenties / early thirties.The cast of this movie is absolutely spectacular, with many big names bringing their A-Game, none more so than Sean Connery who absolutely nails the portrayal of veteran cop, Malone. (He won an Oscar for it).The classical score is another brilliant Ennio Morricone masterpiece, and the cinematography is beautiful, making this an absolute joy to watch!Some poetic license is taken with the real life events, and characteristics of key players, but that should not detract from a movie which is a prime example of Brian De Palma at his very best!",9,0,0,11 June 2020
Joker," This Origin story is no joke!
","Getting straight to It, this film lived up to the hype and was a genuine masterpiece! Best film of 2019 by a country mile!Anyone who has played the Joker has brought something different to make it their own, taking inspiration from different comic representations of the Clown Prince of Crime. Some fantastic (Heath Ledger), some not quite so much (Jared Leto).Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal must be stamped as the definitive Joker origin story on screen. Certainly taking influence from some of the comic source material, but at the same time allowing itself the creative freedom to go in a few new directions.It is at times; funny, painful, uncomfortable to watch, thrilling and captivating all at the same time. Phoenix's Oscar worthy performance is incredibly intense and he plays Arthur Fleck slowly reaching his mental breaking point with an agonising awkwardness.When he casts aside his personal tragic baggage and embraces his Joker persona without resistance, Arthur Fleck's transformation is almost seen as liberating. From that point on, Joker is literally dancing to his own tune, with complete indifference to the world around him....he takes joy in his actions, and his own subjective, cruelly twisted perspective.Whilst the film is firmly set in the DC universe (in 1981), with brief reference to the Wayne family tragedy with creates Batman, it still manages to have some poignant contemporary themes on class divide and social welfare.A man in need of help, with genuine problems, is let down by society and allowed to fall through the cracks, becoming something far worse in process. A Joker who sees himself and the world around him as a cruel joke, with a savage punch line.",10,3,6,17 October 2019
