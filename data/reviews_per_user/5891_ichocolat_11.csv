"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Funny Brit Comedy !
","Boy oh boy oh boy ! This movie is simply fantastic ! Alright, I might get carried away with the comment, though. I've just finished watching it and II just cant wait to post my comment here.But first, let me admit that I seldom watched British films, because I don't quite understand the humor and the British slang. And I admit that I didn't have any expectation as some might have for this film. Heck, after Simon Pegg starred in two very successful films before this (Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead), one would have high expectation for this film.Thank God the film didn't disappoint. To me, this is more than just a no-brainer, brain-dead film, like those s**tty films the producers churned out every year. This film is funny, witty, and contains moral values. It touches my heart (and many others) deeply. It proves that how bad you've been before, how stupid you were, or th b**lock you used to be, with a sincere heart & sincere determination to prove that you can change, you can make up for the wrongdoings you've done.There are some comments that says this film is utter crap, and just a copycat.While there is some truth in that, I don't see why it justifies the notion that his film is not worth the watch.The storyline has been used in many films before, and it certainly is a tried-and-tested formula. So my question is, why change it?Any changes made would make the film of this genre less likable. A case in point; would you rather see Denise failed to finish the race? I doubt that.In a nutshell, this is a heart-warming film, and certainly a good film to watch with the whole family. And no, you don't have to be a runner to like this film.",Null,1,2,12 May 2008
Coraline," Creative & Imaginatice .. a Perfect Combination for a Great Animation !
","Holy camoley ! This film is by far the best animation film for 2009 ! I like everything about it; the animation, the storyline, the creative idea, the brilliant colors and great music ! This isn't your run-of-the-mill remake animation, as this film is original and creative. It also is not what animation is usually for; cheerful cuddly characters performing antics and making viewers laugh.This animation talks about serious issue, hidden subtly in its presentation. It talks about how kids (and teenagers) usually dislikes their parents and their environment, and yearn for life different from what they have. They wanted something different, and they thought the grass is greener on the other side.In this animation, it is not always so. There are baits of 'better' life when actually it is reserved for something sinister.I like the spooky feel of this animation, the dark environment and the surreal set-ups. It is cleverly woven, with art-like precision to make this film a nice watch, whilst being spooky, not gory.I recommend this film to everyone who likes animation. And to those who only began to like animation, I recommend them to give this film a try.P/S : Watch it in 3-D, so cool !",Null,1,2,13 July 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Nice Flick
","Went to watch the film at the cinema just now. Picked out the film because other films shown there were either not interesting or because I've seen it already.I'm not a Hellboy fan, have not read any of the comic, and did not finish watching the first film. So I hope I can give a truly objective review.This sequel, I believe, picked up from where the first film stopped. Hellboy, now married to Liz was living together. And as in any relationship, there's bound to be good days, bad days, and extremely bad days (I quote Fish's phrase).The opening starts with young Hellboy, who was about to go to bed and asked his dad (or is it? I suppose it's not his biological dad, though). He asked for a bedtime story, and his dad told him about the Golden Army.Alright, fast forward to current time. Prince Nuala (the son of the King of Bermootha) crashed an auction house and stole the stuff that belongs to his dad. And it did not stop there. he went on a rampage and let loose his 'pet' to feed on all the people in th auction house.Alright, not gonna spoil the full story :) In my humble opinion, I think the film's was quite good.The audio was superb, the sword swooshing, the monsters squeaking, the works, it was fantastic. The computer-generated animation was also nicely done. It look almost real! However, I think the film's a tad too long, and younger audience in the cinema lost attention halfway through the film. Other than that, nothing major worth mentioning.",Null,2,6,15 July 2008
Knocked Up," Knocked Up: Raising Helen meets 40 Year Old Virgin
","I couldn't help grinning from ear to ear upon reading the review of Knocked Up by a columnist in the paper. Instead of reviewing much of the movie, he played 'spot the obvious' and went complaining about the censorship board in Malaysia. Among one of the points raised by him was the fact that even though the film was labeled 18PL, the film was still butchered anyway by the censorship board. So why have censorship? It explains why the DVD black market is still up and running.The best I could say right now is that we acknowledge the fact that the censorship board is redundant and we are just tired of complaining anyway so we opt out by watching films elsewhere. But in any case, I could only imagine how the censored version of Knocked Up would end up like which is why I am ever so grateful that I could watch the film in its entirety this morning and boy, was it a joy to watch.Ben Stone (played by Seth Rogen) and his stoned friends dream of making a fortune with a website that reveals where and when movie stars get naked in movies while Alison Scott (played by Katherine Heigl) who just got promoted to become a presenter on E! Having been told to 'tighten' (become thinner la) for the sake of the job, it would be a nightmare if she were to get pregnant, right? Well her worst nightmare comes true after chance brings them together in a bar and that one-night stand that they would have would end up as something that would change their lives forever. After all the moral dilemma facing them both, Alison decides to keep the baby with both Alison and Ben deciding to give each other a chance for the sake of the baby. As the nine months pass these two by, tolerance turns to accommodation which turns to true love for the two.Make no mistake, I love Katherine Heigl. I really do. She looks classy, beautiful and at the same time, she looks a tad vulnerable which makes her even more appealing. But anyhow, the best thing about this movie is that both Heigl and Rogen make the movie believable with a sense of chemistry that matches the biological magnitude fazed by them. The ups and downs of their post-pregnancy relationship constantly tugs at your heart leaving you with warmth and fuzziness that only a Disney family flick would have but the obscenity (which also happens to make most of the movie funny) makes it 'Thou shalt not pass' for kids under 21.Parallel to the Alison-Ben relationship issues is the strained marriage between Alison's sister Debbie and her husband Pete who feels the pressure of being married and cannot believe how Debbie could love him so much. All guys face that, don't they? Not believing how a girl that hot could be with a us. Well, when these guys are at home,they complain at the fact that they can't hang out and live free anymore but when on the road, they FINALLY realize how much they miss their ladies and with tails between their legs, they come home to their women. My only qualms was the fact that the movie never really delved into the issue of abortion, but then, if she went for abortion, the movie would end by the half-hour mark, wouldn't it? But all is not doom and gloom as though there may only be a few laughs out there, but when the jokes come, they come at you fast and furious. Some of the best jokes were concerning Alison and Ben having sex with Ben being worried that his penis may poke the unborn child's head and Alison visiting the many gynecologists with one looking at her vagina and exclaiming 'So you do look like your sister!' Watch out for Dr Kuni though. He steals the show whenever he appears. It's also too bad that two of the funniest scenes (one involving an alternate take with Dr Kuni) were not in the final cut but fortunately, they are on YouTube though.Throughout the movie, we'll constantly find ourselves having our fingers crossed hoping that everything will end up rosy for Debbie and Pete, and more importantly Alison and Ben and we do get the happy ending but even then, there is always a doubt in my mind that either couples could just break-up anytime. We hope that love conquers all but then, the cynic in us will just creep out eventually and ask if love is actually enough to hold these two together.",Null,2,4,19 September 2007
The Italian Job," Superb heist-and-chase movie !
","Wonderful ! Nuff said ! The movie is action packed, it is very hard to choose the best stunt. The bombs, the shooting scenes, the car chase and all blew my mind away! The entire movie is full of actions, and one left the cinema satisfied at how it turns out.This movie is a remake of the original with the same title, made in the year 1969. Staying true to the original, there is only a slight differences in the storyline. However, the movie is very well done in the sense that one can watch both the original and the remake, and still enjoy both. Credits to the producer for sticking to the original, and credits too to the cats for the remarkable actions.",Null,0,6,20 December 2007
Monsters vs. Aliens," These cute cuddly characters look better in 3D
","First up, watch this film in 3D instead of the normal screens, if your cinema has it, that is. It looks awesome, and so much livelier too! I like the film so much, the time flies so fast I didn't know it's already over.And it's not only because of the cute and cuddly cartoon characters. I find the graphics breathtaking, the dialogues funny and witty, and the moral values the film tries to instill. Okay, maybe not so much on the moral values, but at least there are no swearing, no adult jokes, which is good, I do not have to cringe in embarrassment in front of the kids in the cinema.The idea is original, and I give credit to the people who comes up with the idea and the others who made the idea became reality. And the 3D, it's so awesome !!",Null,0,1,9 June 2009
I Am Legend," I am Will Smith
","I Am Legend is an adaptation of a novel with the same title, written by Richard Mathesen. However, the only similarities between the novel and the movie are the title and the basic story premise. Other than that, this movie is entirely different than the novel. So, in order to truly enjoy this movie, one has to grasp the idea that it has little to do with the novel, and to enjoy the movie without comparing between the two.Anyway, as long as one can grasp the concept of the movie not being like the novel, the movie is actually pretty good. Although at times it feels like a cross between 'Castaway' and '28 Days Later', it is an engaging watch. This is due to the fact that it has some well-filmed action sequences, a few genuinely scary moments, and awesome acting from Will Smith (and his dog).Fans of Will Smith would be glad to know the movie is full of Will Smith-y goodness. In fact, his presence is so overwhelming that one reckons that instead of pretending it is an adaptation of I Am Legend, it should be called I Am Will Smith. Now that would have been some legend indeed.",Null,1,3,21 December 2007
Up," Up Gets a Thumbs Up !
","You know how Pixar sets new benchmark with each of its release? Yeah, Pixar has done it again, a few notch higher with its latest film, UP.It is wonderfully crafted, nicely executed, and a thoroughly mesmerizing film, one which left imprints in your head long after you have watched it.I like the main character, the cute and cuddly Boy Scout Russell, the beautiful humongous goose (?), the loyal dog, and the balloons.But what I like most wasn't that.What I like most of it is the way the film tries to be different from the other movies in its genre. The idea of flying your house to somewhere in the opposite part of the world, and meeting with many bizarre adventures, are absolutely amazing.I mean, who could have thought about that? It takes a genius to think of it, and a group of super talented crew to put ideas into something this good.The most intense fight in the genre for the best animation for the year, what's with other wonderfully made animations made in this year, i.e Wall*E. Well, I like both Wall*E and UP, but it just happens that I like UP a little bit more :)",Null,1,2,10 September 2009
The Happening," Great Idea .. Poor Execution
","What can I say? The Happening has a great idea, but a very poor execution. The end result? A watchable film, but nothing outstanding, nor there are anything worth taking about.I love the idea that one day, the plants, the trees, the flowers, and even the grass would stand up against humans. For all the things that we have done to them.But this not what I have imagine. Totally! I mean, if this is all they can do, what's there to worry about? What's there to be of concern? We can just get rid of them using pesticide (which Mark Wahlberg has clearly forgotten to use in the film).Not wanting to be a broken record, I's still have to say this. A great idea, but a poor execution. A measly 5 star out of 10 for this one. And that is being generous enough.",Null,0,1,6 August 2011
Live Free or Die Hard," Fast-paced Actions from start to the end !
","I gotta say that the movie is absolutely fantastic! Fast-paced actions from the start go up to the ending credit. The star-studded casts truly lived up to the audiences expectations. Bruce Willis (who plays Det. John McClane), Justin Long, Timothy Olyphant and Maggie Q did a great job in their acting. Kudos to them! The actions kept the audiences in their sit, watching every bit of the actions. A police car rammed a flying helicopter is one of the best scenes I watched. There were plenty of other breathtaking stunts that will leave the audiences satisfied.One may argue that the world is saved by a police detective and a computer wizard from the unfathomable cyber terrorist geeks seems to be far-fetched. And that Det. John McClane did not die even after being thrown out of a fast car, getting shot at and having his arse kicked by the terrorists made the argument all the more convincing. But to me the sheer bizarre-ness of this movie is beside the point. The movie can be way too bizarre and seems to be rather illogical, can still be good. In this case, the movie is very good. Not the best in the Die Hard series though. I liked the first Die Hard most.While watching this movie, it suddenly occurred to me that the threat that cyber terrorism possessed is quite disturbing. In the movie, it showed how a nation crippled by skilled computer users who uses computer for negative use. It is a reminder to us all that something needs to be done to educate everyone to use computer for the benefit of humankind, and not otherwise.",Null,1,3,14 August 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Worry Not, Coz it's Hilarious !
","I gotta say that I had my doubts when Simpsons decided to be made a movie. It's not that I don't think Simpsons is good enough, but because I can't seem to think how are they going to make a 'killer' out of this movie. Boy, oh boy, that's the kind of expectation people have on this movie.Worry not. This is indeed very nicely made ! Kudos to the production crew! They have not disappoint the die-hard fan of this yellow-colored dysfunctional family!The story goes that Homer made a terrible mistake by dumping his new pet pig's crap into the river, thus contaminating the river, forcing EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) to put Springfield in dome. (Yeah, it's not a typo error, I really meant a dome).Watch as the family & the residents of Springfield handle their most frightening moments, & laugh yourself silly !",Null,4,11,30 July 2007
