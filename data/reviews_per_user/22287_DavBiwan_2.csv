Gremlins," Are you People crazy or what ??
","I can not understand how this movie can have a such underestimate rate: 6.9 ??? Are you crazy people ?? This movie is one of the best movie of the 80's. It's fun to watch, it's scary to watch, it's one of the best monster movie ever made. I mean this is a classic , come on this is Gremlins !! The story of the mogwa√Ø who can become a monster if we human don't follow simple rules is so touching and funny at the same time!! Sure this is a simple storyline but the movie is not pretending to give you the screenplay of Usual suspect! This is a great teenage monster movie with great frightening scenes. And the movie deal with deep subject like human responsibility toward nature and how we can let everything destroy it self by not paying attentionPlease wake up and see it again , because we never know, there might be a gremlin behind YOU !!!",10,0,2,8 September 2008
The Dark Knight," Beyond a Super Hero Movie !
","Everyone who are looking for a good story, great actor performances and great action sequences without noticing CGI, have to go and see this BIG movie that is THE DARK KNIGHT ! The movie last about 2h35 min but at anytime you will look at your watch, the film is very well paced.The music is quite the same than Batman Begins but enhanced in a good way and especially used at the right time in the film. Like that moment when you discover the BatPod (one of my favorite moment and one of the most thrilling scene of the film).Every characters is well developed and have their moment, even Michael Caine. And one of the thing i love the most in this movie is that intelligent speech which came out of it, especially about hiding truth to preserve good.So Why i give it a 9 out of 10 ? Only because of little tiny flaws that i noticed like the moment when Batman rescues Rachel and fall of the building to crash on a roof car without any big damages for him or Rachel. Dude ! You will have been dead !! The movie is not perfect and is not better than GODFATHER. Don't Exaggerate people !! I loved it too but hey..!? But when you look at the whole film, you come out of the theater with a big smile on your face because you just witness an incredible story very well directed and not to mention the best performance you have ever seen in a comic book movie: Heath Ledger who deserves an Oscar nomination right now!! GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW !!",10,5,11,29 July 2008
