Frost_Nixon," A great battle of wits, hampered mainly by some noticeable lighting issues.
","Frost/Nixon is a film that really impresses upon the audience how important the events portrayed are, as well as strangely but compellingly humanising former President Nixon - showing just how much of the weight of the world is (or at least, was) on his shoulders.Overall, this film is fantastic and I had a great time watching it. However, I had a few issues with it that brought down the rating somewhat.As stated in the title of this review, Frost/Nixon, in some scenes, has some serious lighting issues where it feels like it's way too harsh on the characters' faces - particularly, in a hotel room scene where the light feels like it's blaring through the open windows and honestly, it looks kinda ugly. Also early on in the film, the 'villainisation' of Nixon felt a bit cartoony with some musical stings coming in once or twice to let the audience know, 'OOO, he's the bad guy!'; It just feels a bit too on-the-nose. Although, it has to be said that, like I said earlier, the film does make you sympathetic towards Nixon and his side later on (...or maybe just Nixon himself). However, apart from the lighting in some scenes and the early over-the-top villainisation, Frost/Nixon is still a great film that's well acted and expertly brings to life one of the biggest landmark interview series in television history.",8,0,0,2 September 2018

The Death of Stalin," An hilariously frenetic comedy, that also works as an insightful, if satirical and purposefully inaccurate look into the period after Stalin's death.
","'The Death of Stalin' is utterly fantastic. While it is predominately focused on being a dark comedy film, it still functions, quite clearly, as a political thriller - with the mind games that each individual makes to curry favour with another being fascinating to watch.Needless to say, the positives of this movie far outweigh the negatives. First of all, the brilliant and varied performances of each member of the cast makes every character memorable, even if their names don't 'stick' in your head as much. Secondly, the cinematography is equally powerful with many great sweeping shots that show off the impeccable set design and costume work, as well as pretty clever uses of scene blocking here and there - although, in all fairness, the cinematography isn't completely consistent throughout with many shots merely being adequate. Thirdly, there were a lot of clever metaphors and usage of symbolism throughout the film; most notably, with the orchestra at the beginning being inter-cut with the removal of Russian citizens to Gulag prison camps - showing the 'orchestration' of the governmental forces behind the scenes.This also hints at the aforementioned 'mind games' that are about to begin. Furthermore, the use of 'Articles' to show governmental proceedings and what is about to take place in the scene complements the Totalitarian and systematic nature of the Soviet Union government - juxtaposed by the fact that, with the death of Stalin, everyone is naturally in a frenzied panic (either vying for control or looking for what to do next) climaxing with a political coup to 'remove' Beria from trying to assert any more power, something which he has been carefully building over the course of the film (And of course, by 'removal', I mean being found guilty in a kangaroo court and being shot in the head. What do you expect? This is the Soviet Union, after all).My only major criticisms of the film is that, as stated previously, the cinematography can be occasionally iffy, and that the editing in some areas could have done with a bit more polishing (e.g. the slow-mo audio effect in one scene is poorly inserted and you can hear the audio 'cut off' when the character is done speaking, because there's a noticeable amount of noise in the audio clip).Still, if you're looking for a great comedic political thriller, this might be the film for you. It certainly was for me.",9,1,1,17 November 2018
12 Monkeys," Absolutely Surreal And Utterly Bleak.
","Absolutely surreal, utterly bleak and one of the best time travel movies I've ever seen.When it comes to the story's performance, Brad Pitt's character, Jeffrey, is a standout performance for his expressions and body language - the little inflections and facial movement in his delivery really emphasise the insanity of his character while working as a brilliant red herring for who caused the viral outbreak that decimated the population of the earth as it's revealed that it wasn't the titular 12 Monkeys that caused it, but instead the assistant of Jeffrey's father, a virologist, and the story unfolds in such a manner that you realise that the main character, James Cole (Bruce Willis), is part of a closed 'causal loop' with his actions leading to the viral outbreak happening in the first place. And despite its many twists and turns, the plot somehow never gets overly convoluted or confusing. Also, the romance subplot between Cole and his psychiatrist, Dr. Railly, is surprisingly believable and touching. The neo-noir/steampunk-esque set design and props are also gorgeously created and showcased through the film's (mostly) excellent shot composition, like the strange 'eyeball' contraption that observes Cole in the scientist's room or the dilapidated underground area shown in the opening credits sequence. However, as you might guess from the phrase '(mostly) excellent', I didn't think the cinematography was perfect. Mainly it's because I felt that the use of dutch angles was overused. I get that the atmosphere of the film is uneasy and the 'dutches' reflect that, but at the same time, I definitely think it could have been toned down significantly through more varied camera positioning and blocking.Overall: 9/10; maybe high 8 or lower, somewhere around there.",9,0,0,9 September 2019
12 Angry Men," A courtroom drama (mostly) without the courtroom, and yet firmly establishes itself within the canon of 'Courtroom cinema' with gusto.
","'12 Angry Men' manages to accomplish what very few films manage to do: make a successful, engaging film that plays out almost entirely within one room. For the vast majority of the run-time, the film takes place entirely within four small walls. And the fact that it manages to accomplish so much with those walls should be praise in and of itself.Firstly, the plot is exceptional - a murder trial. The defendant, a boy who is assumed to have killed his father in an emotional outburst. If he's found guilty by the 'angry men', he gets the electric chair. The details of this case are quickly thrown into suspicion by Fonda, and from there, it's a snowball of confusion that casts a long shadow of doubt over the jury's proceedings - leading from an (almost) unanimous vote of 'guilty' to a completely unanimous vote of 'not guilty'. This flip feels completely natural and logical, due to the clever writing. In addition, due to the tightness of the plotting, the pacing of the film was consistently strong. The cleverness of the writing also applies in many other areas such as with Lee J. Cobb's character - a man who, at the film's climax, is revealed to have imposed his own furious and frustrated feelings towards his own son upon the defendant. In fact, the writing helps to distinguish each character effectively, giving each instantly recognisable character traits: Henry Fonda's character is calm but unsure, Lee J. Cobb's character is excitable and probably the most angry out of the 12, Jack Warden's character is lazy and a slouch (and so on and so on...). Many of the characters' actions also highlighted particular social prejudices (e.g. suggesting that, because he grew up in a slum, he was given to violence), that hint at how much of an effect past experience has on a decision - and how no decision, especially one as important as deciding the life of a young man, is ever truly unbiased (as shown distinctly by Lee J. Cobb's character, as mentioned above). And of course, all the nuances of this writing are demonstrated and carried by fantastic performances across the board by all the actors.As stated previously, the film does indeed take place almost entirely within the jury room with only three short scenes outside of it: inside the courthouse, inside the courtroom and outside the courthouse. But what keeps the room from feeling stagnant is the cinematography, which is fantastic throughout with clever use of blocking (i.e. An actor's moves in relation to the camera) and interesting, varied angles and shot compositions - one moment, two actors are looking out a window discussing elements of the case and then, in one swift dolly move, we're now focused back on the table and the rest of the group. The blocking also further accentuated each character's movements and idiosyncrasies, which in combination with the writing, also elevated the characters more and more. Considering the quality of the writing, the pacing, the acting, the cinematography and the blocking, there's very little to truly criticise '12 Angry Men' for - except for maybe one thing: the score was forgettable, but it wasn't used much anyway, so definitely more of a nitpick than a real criticism.If you're going to watch one great courtroom drama film in your lifetime, make it the one that helped to define the genre (and also make it the one that doesn't even unfold inside of a courtroom).",10,0,0,19 September 2018
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," A hilarious film, with remarkable intelligence below its seemingly 'offensive-for-the-sake-of-it' exterior.
","Although I haven't seen much of the original show myself, 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' was still insanely enjoyable. It has a lot of crude humour, but also it's surprisingly intelligent - commenting on everything from violence, foul language, censorship, the American military and a lot more. In addition, despite the large number of references to previous episodes of the original show (which I have not seen much of yet; consider this my first real introduction to South Park), the movie was still funny regardless. My first criticism is that the computer generated effects, like when Kenny goes to Hell, are a bit dated. But then again, what can you expect from a film made in 1999? Besides it still looks somewhat OK. But secondly, and more importantly, the romance subplot between Stan and Wendy isn't as interesting or funny as the rest of the movie, takes up a small but noticeable amount of runtime and is resolved rather anti-climatically with Wendy abruptly ditching her then-boyfriend Gregory for no apparent reason (even if it is kinda funny in its abruptness).Apart from that, though, 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' is still well-written, clever and most importantly of all, funny. 8/10 (Maybe a 9, but doesn't quite reach it due to aforementioned criticisms)",8,0,0,16 September 2018
Oldboy," Gloriously Chaotic And Savagely Emotional.
","If you want to have my thoughts on this film be expressed in greater detail than I ever could, go check out YourMovieSucks' review of Oldboy. While its predominately about the (apparently) abhorrent 2013 American remake, it also goes over what makes the original so great and it also helped me to understand its plot, symbolism and messaging far more clearly.In essence, I think what makes Oldboy something special is just how purposeful everything is. There's so many little things than go into developing and crafting it, it's simply astounding. The way the narrative unfolds is both a joy to behold and is also utterly no-holds barred with how far it goes in depicting graphic violence and imagery; but again, with purpose, as Oh Dae-Su (the main character brilliantly performed by Choi Min-sik) becomes a 'beast' satiated only by revenge whose motivations, though clouded by rage, are sympathetic. And the cinematography captures it so well with such impressive variety complementing the story damn near perfectly. A good example is when Oh Dae-Su is first imprisoned, the camera's perspective is low to the ground with an extreme close-up of the hatch he's sticking his head out of, desperate for help and the knowledge of why he has been imprisoned. The audience has just as much information as he does (which is very little) and both the plot and cinematography carries this mystery throughout in so many ways to the point where you notice things in earlier scenes that play a part in the grand scheme of the narrative.And despite his excessive flaws, the audience can still sympathise with Oh Dae-Su and can understand his perceptions of himself as a shameful monster driven mad by a lack of human companionship, which speaks volumes of the film's incredibly strong characterisation. There's also plenty of intertextual references going on. Most explicitly, the film in-part adapts the myth of Oedipus Rex, whose events echo the major plot twist of Oldboy (though it's retold in a far more uncompromisingly brutal way). My main hangup with this film is that I thought the hypnosis thing that acts as a crucial plot device seemed like a bit of a cop-out...? Maybe cop-out is too harsh a word, but it seemed like a lot of Oldboy's events were predicated on the idea of hypnotic suggestion which I found to be difficult to suspend my disbelief over, even when considering all the other 'outlandish' occurrences within the film.Overall: 9/10 - Maybe I'm wrong about the hypnosis thing and it makes perfect sense. In which case, it might be a 10/10. Either way, it's a gloriously chaotic and savagely emotional revenge film that's well worth a watch (if you're not of the faint of heart).",9,4,4,29 September 2019
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Competent But Obtuse.
","If I could wrap up my feelings on Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy in three words, it would be 'competent, but obtuse'. Because there's a lot I liked about it for sure: the acting was pretty decent (Hardy, Oldman and Cumberbatch were my favourites as I think they did the best job and had the most development), the sets, costumes and props all looked great and seemed to fit well into the Cold War era atmosphere. Plus the cinematography is great with a lot of variation in shot composition, colour and lighting - with its usually dark and oppressive environments with cold sterile walls and harsh shadows (again, fitting as a Cold War era film, an era with much uncertainty and looming threats around every corner). However, there are just a lot of things holding this movie back from being anything truly special. For one, the narrative is very confusing. It demands so much of your attention, which isn't a bad thing necessarily. But I often found myself being bewildered by the arrival of seemingly new plot elements and characters that the movie, I feel, didn't do an adequate enough job of setting up.And there's so many of these major and minor characters that you need to be aware of. But the movie doesn't spend a lot of time on building or developing many of them...which leads to much of the cast being bland, unmemorable and very similar to one another despite the overall quality of the performances. Also, the reveal of the identity of the mole inside British Intelligence was very underwhelming considering the immense amount of tension that was being built throughout the course of the film and especially in the last fifteen to twenty minutes. I noticed a lot of plot inconsistencies or discrepancies too, like 'Why did Jim Prideaux act nice to that school kid and then yell at him to go away just before he shot Bill Haydon (Firth), who was the mole and his old friend? Was it because he didn't want to get the kid involved in what he was doing or trying to preserve his innocence? Early on the film, did he think he could learn to be better and integrate himself back into society, but discovered that he couldn't and thus tried to shut the boy out of his life? Either way, his aggression seems out of character. Why was Bill at all allowed to wander around outside and along the fence freely considering his status as a high profile target? Did Peter (Cumberbatch) ever make up with his lover/family member/something else (Again, the nature of that character is not really established)? He kicked him out of the house to prevent him from being targeted, presumably. If the answer is no, that he didn't meet up with him again, he seems remarkably chipper about it at the end. If it's yes, it certainly wasn't included in the film. Are we just supposed to intuit that he did? Speaking of which, Tom Hardy's arc just ends, the last time we see Hardy is a closeup of him in the rain, looking somewhat sullen. That's...one way of ending a character's story, I guess.'Overall: Maybe I'll like it more on a repeat viewing, now that I have a decent grasp on the story. But for now, the best I can give it is a 6/10 - mainly for its cinematography and performances. The rating could be lower, more so than it could be higher.",6,1,3,28 September 2019
Ocean's Twelve," Yeah, this one isn't as good as the first.
","I know that's pretty blunt, but those were my feelings right after watching it. It's not bad per se, and it definitely has some of the great elements of 'Ocean's Eleven' - mainly the characters and performances. But what mainly lets it down is how overly tangled and messy the plot is. Firstly, for a movie that's posited as a 'heist' film, there's very little actual heisting that's going on on-screen. You only get to see some snippets of a few heists, and in the van der Woude house heist, a lot of the actual heist is just 'sped up'. Secondly, you have the romance subplot between Rusty and the Europol agent, which I found to be quite dull AND it takes up quite a significant amount of screen time. But before I rag on this film too much, there were some things I really liked about it. Like how in one scene, where the 'gang' are discussing the best approach to the van der Woude heist, they talk over each other in a convincing manner - instead of feeling like it's just actors waiting for each other to say a line, it actually sounds like a discussion between real people.But back to what wasn't great about the movie. Much like the first, the editing was bizarre but, to its credit, less so than 'Ocean's Eleven'. The cinematography was really poor in some scenes, looking like an episode of a really low-budget documentary or children's television show. And finally, the soundtrack wasn't nearly as memorable as the first. In general, while it does some things well, it's just too convoluted for its own good and is simply a lesser film than it's predecessor.Overall: 6/10, maybe high 5 or low-mid 6.",6,2,3,2 March 2019
Ocean's Thirteen," 'Ocean's' is back to doing what it does best.
","After an awkward middle entry, 'Ocean's' is back to doing what it does best: engage you in a thrilling heist filled with twists as well as plans for every eventuality. But this time, it's personal. Yes, after a beloved member of Ocean's team, Rueben, is conned out of his investment in a new casino by Willy Bank and has a heart attack as a result, the team decide to make Mr. Bank pay, literally and figuratively, by making his new casino pay out tremendous amounts of money to its patrons on opening night. It's a compelling setup, largely due to the fact that I have grown to become attached to these characters over the course of three films and therefore felt an immense amount of satisfaction watching the 'Eleven' stick it to Mr. Bank. And sure, the idea of another casino heist might seem blasé to fans of the first film. But considering the disastrous attempt at a change in formula with 'Ocean's Thirteen', at least based on the critical response, it's understandable why a 'return-to-form' was made.So pretty much everything I liked about 'Ocean's Eleven' - the heist plan itself, the characters, the music, the humour, the dialogue - is present in 'Ocean's Thirteen' and it's all great stuff. Not to mention, we get to see Eddie Izzard as Nagel in a more prominent role than in 'Ocean's Twelve' (which is great for me, 'cause I like Eddie Izzard) as well as the glorious Al Pacino in a scenery-chewing, wonderfully brash and brazen performance as Willy Bank, the 'mark' that Ocean's team is after. And the film also has the best editing in the trilogy with (almost) no weird edits at all! Although, it's hard not to feel like you're just watching an overhauled rehash of the first film. Don't get me wrong, it's still enjoyable - but it still has the impression of a rehash all the same considering many of the same elements and 'setups' are here. For example, a seasoned 'Ocean's' viewer knows when the 'Gotcha!' moments are coming, so they don't have quite as much of a punch to them as they did in the first film. Take for example, the reveal that the FBI agent who apparently arrests Linus, one of Ocean's eleven, is actually Linus' father. The film plays it tongue-in-cheek with a wink to the audience as if to say, 'Bet you didn't see that one coming!'...except we absolutely did.Overall: 7/10, maybe mid-high 6 or low-mid 7.",7,0,0,2 March 2019
Barry Lyndon," A powerful dramatic epic, in every sense of the word.
","Barry Lyndon, adapted from the novel by William Thackeray, is so tremendously exceptional that it's hard to explain why in a way that hasn't already been said several times over by many reviewers before.Despite its incredibly long run-time, Barry Lyndon manages to keep the viewer engaged and focused on a character study that weaves the most compelling tale. Its visuals amaze; every shot is set up so perfectly, it's stunning just to watch the shots begin to 'unfold', become fully composed and 'lined up', for want of a better term. In fact, pretty much everything about this movie is amazing and honed to perfection - the acting, the cinematography, the drama - even just the colours themselves are gorgeous to look at!There's very little criticism I can find with this film - so much so that I'm struggling to find anything I can really criticise right off the top of my head. The only slight criticism I can find is that, at times, it seems the characters' accents can 'slip' out a little here and there i.e. Ryan O'Neal's Irish accent seems to come and go quite frequently. But this isn't enough to truly diminish the film's rating at all. A 10/10 from me doesn't mean the film is perfect - but Barry Lyndon comes unbelievably close.",10,3,6,3 September 2018
American Sniper," Gritty, Brutal At Times, And Pretty Alright.
","Yeah, it's alright.Bradley Cooper's performance is pretty good, the pacing is decent, there are a few nice shots here and there, and a lot of sympathy and attention is given to soldiers and civilians caught within a war zone and the effect it has on their state of mind. It's certainly not a fresh and original take on the trauma of warfare, but it's certainly presented well with decent seemingly realistic gun-play and some very harrowing moments - like seeing a young child and his mother being killed by the protagonist in one of the opening scenes (arguably justifiable in the context of the scene, but nonetheless an intense moment of ethical dilemma). So I think it's fair to say that this film doesn't exactly pull its punches. And while American Sniper comes with a good helping of chest-thumping patriotism, which is to be expected from a Clint Eastwood film, it still does an okay job of at least giving some humanity to the opposing side like showing a picture of the enemy sniper, Mustafa, as a Syrian gold medalist in the past. It's limited, sure, but at least it's there.However, the cinematography isn't all that special, the score is unmemorable, and very few of the characters outside of the few in the main cast have any character development whatsoever, thus the few that die leave barely any emotional impact and the ones that survive are wholly unremarkable. In addition, its realism and accuracy to the real-world events is questionable to say the very least (but again, that's expected with most films like this) and some of the special effects like the helicopter in the sandstorm are quite bad. Not to mention that clearly fake baby doll which everyone has already talked about at great length, so I won't.Overall: 6/10",6,1,29,16 August 2019

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A lovingly constructed, beautifully animated love letter to the Spider-Man mythos.
","I don't know what took me so long, but I finally saw it: what many people say is one of the best animated films ever made, or at least, certainly of the past few years. In the words of the ever-classic phrase, 'Does it live up to the hype?' Well yes, essentially. Well, I guess that's the review!In all seriousness, it does mostly live up to the hype as an excellent animated film. And I put emphasis on animated. Because honestly, if it wasn't for the incredibly vibrant, detailed, and gorgeously textured and layered animation...I don't think it would necessarily be revered as it is. That's not to say the story is crap or anything, far from it. It's well told, has a nice progression and pace to it, doesn't get slowed down unnecessarily and is full of a cast of colourful (or in one specific case, colourless) characters. But there are a fair few (the dreaded word) cliches in it. The one that stood out the most was the group of heroes (or other versions of Spider-Man from other dimensions) leaving the protagonist, Miles Morales, behind at the final battle because he wasn't ready. Soon after, he manages to gain complete control over his powers which he has been struggling with throughout the movie and then joins up with the rest of the Spider-Men (Mens? Spider-People? Eh, I don't know) at the battle, and ultimately, saves the day.Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting a revolutionary story or anything, but some parts of it felt like I had seen it plenty of times in other films before (particularly, animated films). Now, before anyone writes me off as being a hater of this film, there are still plenty of cool things in the story. The death of the main universe's Spider-Man came out of left field. I really wasn't expecting it and it took some serious guts to actually do that - near the opening of the film no less - and it sets up the overarching plot of the story really nicely. The reveal that Miles Morales' uncle was The Prowler, henchmen of the Kingpin, was pretty neat even if his death lacked any emotional impact for me (Ah crap, we're back to negatives again). But I suppose, while we're on the subject, I wonder if there's something wrong with me when it comes to a character's death in a film or if I've just seen this sort of death so many times before that I've become desensitized to it.Anyway, back to what makes the film excellent. For one thing, other than the beautiful animation, the humour is (like the film itself) fast-paced, energetic and doesn't slow down for a second. So while not every joke will land, the film just moves on as quickly as possible to a joke that probably will. The humour is also aided by the animation with little details here and there like little captions (the yellow boxes) representing Miles' thoughts ('Play dumb!'...'Not that dumb!'), referencing other comic book conventions like visual onomatopoeia ('Bagel' is probably my favourite instance of it) as well as each character having their own little quirks in animation style (like Noir Spider-Man being fascinated by the colours on a Rubik's Cube or Spider-Ham's propensity for 'Hammerspace'), which further makes each character stand out.Let's see, what were other things I liked about the film? Well, I thought Kingpin's motivation was interesting: trying to bring back his dead wife and son by taking them from another dimension. At least it wasn't some generic 'TAKE OVER THE WORLD' modus operandi that more generic villains seem to always have. Although, I think Doc Ock's character could have been fleshed out a bit more. The reveal that she was Doctor Octopus was neat, but I think they could have done more with her. Well, sequels are a thing, so we can only hope.And I do desperately want a sequel because this film really is amazing, and I simply cannot overstate how beautiful this film is visually - so much so that I desperately want to look up Behind the Scenes stuff, and talks by the animators on how they pulled off some of the sequences. And yes, my only major criticism is that I think the story could be a bit stronger. But even with the weaknesses in the narrative, 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse' is still a lovingly constructed, beautifully animated love letter to the Spider-Man mythos that I'm sure will be thought of as a classic years down the line.Overall: 9/10, with a good chance of being a 10/10...I guess. Look, I don't know where to place it, just go watch it - it's fantastic!",9,0,0,11 June 2019
In the Name of the Father," Not great, but good.
","In The Name Of The Father is a good movie. Not great, but good. After all, it has a lot going for it: great acting (particularly from its headlining stars: Day-Lewis, Postlethwaite and Thompson), solid and assured direction as well as, obviously, a thought-provoking story about four individuals who were wrongly imprisoned for over 15 years for a crime they did not commit (as well as seven others sent to prison on separate charges). But belying these good aspects, is an over-simplified, poorly-paced and sometimes confusing version of the truth. The story that's being told of the 'Guildford Four' can be perplexing at times, largely because of the pacing and editing of the film. Characters are introduced in some scenes which leave you going 'Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?', before it clicks much later on in the film who they are and what those scenes were about - and not in a good way. I'm sure a second or third viewing may clear up some of those aspects for me, but it usually doesn't speak well of a film if you're going back to watch it just you can understand what happened fully - rather than re-watching it to try and catch details you missed and/or analyse the film more closely.In addition, despite the lengthy run-time, the story is dreadfully slow and out of balance at times. For example, Thompson barely seems to appear in the film, and seeing more of what she did to try and get the Guildford Four out of prison would have been compelling. The out-of-kilter pacing also led to some strange moments i.e. we're told about Guiseppe, Gerry's father, leading a campaign to try and get them free; the result of which we only see in the last 15-20 minutes of the film. Much like Thompson's rare appearances, it would have been nice to see more of this, rather than merely being told it, and how it came about rather than seemingly going from 0 to 100 in the blink of an eye.In short, the over two hour run-time should have been cut down and streamlined, and could have almost definitely benefited from adjusting the story beats significantly. There are other issues with the editing such as (at least) two noticeably dubbed over lines, and (on a lesser note) unimpressive and boring opening and closing credits (not really that much of a negative, but I thought I'd point it out regardless). Because of these aforementioned issues, I can't give this film an overwhelmingly positive score despite its merits. I therefore sentence 'In The Name Of The Father' to a 7/10, with a possible re-review in the future to consider any other possibilities that may have been missed.Court is adjourned.",7,1,1,5 November 2018
Ocean's Eleven," Talk about 'the perfect crime'.
","In terms of an elaborate heist story that keeps building and revealing the full extent of the plan as the film goes on, I haven't quite seen anything else like 'Ocean's Eleven'. The way this film unfolds is something to marvel at, and is practically worth the price of admission on it's own. Fortunately, it has more going for it than just a well thought-out heist plan that accounts for every single eventuality. What also stands out are the characters and the soundtrack. Each of the heist members are distinct and memorable, much like the soundtrack is - with classical tunes mixed in with then-modern beats, as well as a funky, jazzy score that evokes the spirit of a romanticized era of film and music and thus, gives the film a sense of timelessness...if it weren't for the chunky early-2000s mobile phones, that is. But those, in all fairness, can be easily overlooked.The movie also has a good dose of humour, but it never detours the film for the sake of making a joke or needlessly 'ruins' a serious or emotional moment. Rather, it helps to flesh out the characters and make them feel real and believable. In addition, the humour is interwoven with the dialogue, which has no small measure of wit or cleverness to it and again, contributes to improving the overall characterisation. Finally, the pacing is actually remarkably strong - even in the slower moments, it never feels like the film is dragging its heels and instead, manages to maintain a breakneck pace with ease. My only major criticism with the film is that some of the editing can be...odd. Specifically, the transitions and occasional effect such as the ever-'classic' 3D flip transition and the intentionally choppy footage in the scene where Ocean spots a potential heist member on a train. These editing choices seem bizarre and amateurish, and do drag the film's rating down somewhat.Overall: 8/10, maybe 9 or higher if it wasn't for some of the weird editing decisions.",8,0,1,2 March 2019
Liar Liar," A sweet but generic comedy, that wouldn't nearly be as special without Jim Carrey.
","Although I can't say I'm a mega-fan of Jim Carrey's form of comedy, he was completely perfect for the role as Fletcher Reede, the arrogant lawyer who is as wholly strange as he is truly loving of his son. This love really is the heart of the film (no pun intended), but without Jim Carrey's over-the-top face-pulling performances, 'Liar Liar' would be relatively unspecial - a so-so plot, bland cinematography, an unmemorable score and more cheese than the dairy section of a supermarket. Although, depending on who you are, that cheesiness could be one of the film's more endearing qualities.7/10 (And without Jim Carrey, it would be around a 5 or 6)",7,0,0,15 September 2018

Other points/Neither positive or negative</li></ul><ul><li>(P) Densely and tightly plotted; slow burn to start, but rapidly picks up and doesn't stop</li><li>(P) Great acting across the board (with a handful of over-acted moments here and there e.g. Michael Douglas smashing his briefcase over a lawn chair was verging on laugh-out-loud material for me (Although, conversely, Douglas was the standout performance in the film - providing a range of emotion befitting of the evolution of a cold, emotionless businessman into a more considerate, kinder person after his experience in the Game taught him to not shut himself off emotionally like his father before him.

Ip Man," A decent well-made martial arts film.
","'Ip Man' is a solid martial arts film with plenty of action set-pieces and impressive fight choreography to keep you entertained. The plot is simple, but straightforward and uncomplicated - which allows the film to focus on other aspects such as the characters. In particular, Donnie Yen (who plays Ip Man) is a charismatic protagonist, playing a stoic grandmaster of Wing Chun who also manages to have some personality and a sense of humour about him. Speaking of personality, the set design is excellent with many memorable, characterful locations (e.g. the darkened prison-like Japanese dojo; the bombed out streets of Fo Shan; Ip Man's tranquil home at the beginning of the film etc.). In turn, the set design is shown off through the cinematography, which simultaneously draws attention to the fight choreography through finely tuned shot compositions (even if it does fall back on 'shakycam' a bit too much). The main issue with the film is with its pacing, which is incredibly slow at the start, decent in the middle, and ridiculously rushed at the end. Because of this, the beginning of the film can feel rather boring and the epilogue doesn't feel complete or satisfying. Instead, there are on-screen captions saying what happened to Ip Man after he was shot through the shoulder and escaped to Hong Kong - a classic example of telling and not showing.Overall: 7/10, maybe a high 6 or low 7?",7,0,0,1 March 2019
Annie Hall," 'Irrational, And Crazy, And Absurd...' And I Love It.
","Annie Hall is a film that surprised me quite immediately by how eclectic it was. It was eclectic in its cinematography, its humour, its editing, its elaborate breaking of the fourth wall...and it went by so quickly that I felt like re-watching it immediately after the first viewing. Will I? I very well could. And not many films I've watched have ever instilled me with that feeling.Maybe it inevitably comes down to the fact that many of the more intertextual jokes in Annie Hall are ones I don't completely understand. Possibly it's the jokes and little details that pass you by before you even get the chance to fully take it all in, like the photos Annie (Diane Keaton) took of Alvy (Woody Allen) with the lobster in a later scene or the pedestrian crossing lights changing to 'Walk' as Alvy leaves the frame after saying goodbye to Annie, literally and metaphorically indicating their relationship is over...maybe I'm reading into that too deeply.But perhaps its 'rewatchability' results from the chemistry in its cast. The story of two neurotic but very different people who fall in and out of love is strange, compelling and oddly sweet, and the 'fidgeting' and insistence of the narrative to go all over the place is as if Alvy is trying to piece together what went wrong in his and Annie's relationship - but the audience has vague ideas of why just by being outside observers. So the portrait the film paints of its characters could be why I like it so much. I can't honestly say, I would need to stew on it for a lot longer to come to a more definitive conclusion.But what I do know is that, somehow, I love this film. Like it's final line, my interest in Annie Hall seems 'totally irrational, and crazy, and absurd...', but something tells me I will keep revisiting this film for a while yet.Overall: 10/10 - as with all my ratings, it's just an arbitrary number and may fluctuate.",10,0,0,24 August 2019
Taken," A supremely entertaining Action Thriller, with moments of cleverness sprinkled throughout - but falters a bit due to its mounting issues.
","James Bond may be synonymous with badass-spy-hero-man, but Liam Neeson's 'Brian Mills', while not having as 'cool' a name, still knows how to duke out with the best. At least, in Movie-land.'Taken' is a surprisingly entertaining action movie that managed to actually unsettle me with some of its themes - namely, forced prostitution - and intrigue me with the way it sets up Neeson's character; the way it doles out his essence with his extreme cautiousness and protectiveness of his daughter, Kim, and his other 'particular skills' that are showcased thoroughly throughout the film.Because of this, Neeson's character was one of 'Taken''s best features. Demonstrating what he's capable of, but leaving enough of him in the shadows to keep you questioning who exactly he is (or was...). After all, the closest we get in terms of knowing what Neeson did before he 'retired' was that he was a 'preventer'. This mystery allows us to fill in the gaps of his character ourselves and imagine how he knows what he knows (Although, his knowledge of torture techniques, which he uses on 'Marko', gives us hints at his dark past).Some of the film's other qualities are its action and occasionally, its cinematography. The action was fun, very much so in fact, and it wasn't just Neeson shooting dudes. There was a lot of variation which held my interest; whether it be examining a crime scene, outwitting French agents - switching cars and using a walkie-talkie to speak into a phone to talk to 'Jean Claude', his old French friend and colleague. Speaking of Jean Claude, though, the movie made me laugh out loud at one point - where he's walking home with a baguette in his hands. A baguette. Just in case we somehow didn't realise he was French.But I digress. The cinematography is...OK, and as I said above, its occasionally good with one or two really nice shots sprinkled in here and there.I also appreciated the fact that the film didn't need to show captions on-screen to let us know where we were. Many, many films are guilty of this, but this film manages to accomplish this entirely through Cinematic language and not on-screen text - which is commendable.But if it weren't for Neeson's character, some dark themes and moments, its action, some decent shots and its use of the language of film...this film would be painfully generic with many major plot holes.Some of these plot plots include, 'Why would Neeson's daughter leave that map with where she was going in an open pocket of her suitcase, if she didn't want her father to know they were traveling around Europe?...Did the documents that Neeson signed that gave permission for Kim to travel to Paris say where she was traveling, or was the location not specified? Otherwise, why would he sign it? Surely he'd pore over that document before even thinking of giving permission...How come Kim's friend, Amanda, is shown dead in that one scene and presumably, Neeson doesn't at least try to recover the body? And she's just forgotten about by the end of the film?...After knocking out Jean Claude, a former French Intelligence agent, how the hell does Neeson manage to get home again without being arrested at the airport for attacking a former French Intelligence agent? Or because Jean Claude was apparently corrupt, did the 'good' French cops excuse Neeson's multiple homicides because he exposed a major sex trafficking ring?'Not to mention the score is unimpressive and the 'shakycam' could get really bad at times.So yeah, the plot holes and the other issues mentioned above really limit this film being very highly-rated, but for what it's worth, 'Taken' is still a fun Action Thriller with interesting moments and glimmers of cleverness here and there.",6,1,1,18 September 2018
La La Land," An expertly shot film with great songwriting and visual flair, let down by an occasionally predictable story.
","Chazelle's (roughly) fourth love letter to music and his second directly focused on jazz, 'La La Land' is impressively captivating with Technicolor-saturated shots, Pasek and Paul's catchy well-crafted lyrics and Justin Hurwitz's equally compelling musical score. Although the plot in general can be, on occasion, cliched and formulaic (albeit, perhaps as an attempt to recreate the musicals of old), it doesn't stop 'La La Land' from tap-dancing into the Movie Musical Hall of Fame.8/10 (Somewhat leaning towards a 7, or maybe even towards a 9)",8,1,2,15 September 2018
Groundhog Day," An exciting fantasy comedy wrapped in a romance, that pushes its 'time loop' concept to the maximum creative potential.
","As I watched Groundhog Day, over time, just like Phil does with Punxsutawney in this movie, I began to fall in love with it. Firstly, Bill Murray is, of course, great in his role as the narcissistic deadpan Phil - but the film allows Murray to expand upon that archetypal character. The film joyfully toys with his evolution over the film from this passive-aggressive, depressed weatherman to a kind-hearted man who, through his ambiguous amount of time in the Groundhog Day loop, learns to appreciate the smaller things in life or rather, the smaller towns and the intricacies of their citizens. And this time loop brilliantly facilitates this transformation. Phil goes from paranoia to joyriding to suicide to eventual acceptance of his situation, becoming a better person for the people of Punxsutawney.Secondly, Harold Ramis' role as director and main screenplay writer means the time loop concept is pushed to its absolute breaking point. In contrast, in 'Back To The Future', the concept of time travel is explored, but it feels like it could have been pushed a bit further. But 'Groundhog Day' finely examines and cherry picks from the whole spectrum of 'What would you do if you essentially had infinite time to play with (or more accurately, to get trapped in)?'There's also a surprisingly sweet love story between Phil and his producer Rita that, despite him technically only knowing her for less than a day, he comes to understand her intimately and acutely.Lastly, there is a surprising amount of clever symbolism and shot composition. For example, the opening shot of the same cumulus clouds rolling past in shot after shot foreshadows both Phil's job as a weatherman and the time loop that is to come. Or how about the 'snow shovel man' who we see in the background of a shot where Phil is making a phone call only for him to come in and whack Phil in the head with said shovel? The film is littered with many of these cunningly well-placed visual gags as well as a vast array of sharp witted verbal jokes. To put it simply, Harold Ramis' assured direction and pure imaginative talent makes 'Groundhog Day' an exemplary example of how to make a superbly engaging film out of a deceptively simple idea - through compelling character development, unmatched creativity, quick wit and carefully crafted visuals.",10,1,1,15 September 2018
The Untouchables," 'Eh, Fuhgeddaboudit, It's An Okay Movie!'
","The Untouchables has two major things going for it: its well-realised 1930s Chicago setting and its cast, particularly Robert De Niro who gives a decent and convincingly threatening portrayal of the notorious gang leader, Al Capone. Its lead, Kevin Costner, however, who plays the main 'untouchable' police officer Eliot Ness, doesn't do as good a job as his fellow performers and feels a bit stilted. Some of his scenes I would even consider laughable. The way he delivers the lines 'God, didn't ya hear what l said? What are you, deaf? What is this, a game?!' was a memorable standout that gives off the impression of being a first take, a warmup for an 'actual' performance. His romance with his wife, Catherine (Patricia Clarkson), also felt terribly cliched, like you've seen it in so many films before and his character as a whole just has very little going on - he's your typical morally driven good cop that's seen (or rather, is about to see) some sh!t.And unfortunately, despite the other members of the cast's performances, the deaths of two 'Untouchables', Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery) and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), lacked any real punch for me as the film didn't give them enough time to grow fully as characters or for the audience to sympathise with them and get to know them better. Yeah, Oscar's death is brutal for sure (getting shot in the head and then hung inside the elevator), but it just didn't yield that much of a reaction from me. Plus the copious amounts of blood that poured out of Connery's body made highly unrealistic the idea that he was still alive, let alone conscious. And he somehow manages to stay alive long enough to impart information and wisdom to Ness and Stone (Andy García)! The film isn't exactly historically accurate, not by any stretch of the imagination, but Malone's prolonged survival throws any semblance of reality out the window.And hell, the death of a little girl in a bombing in the opening scene was far more impactful to me than two of the main characters' deaths (perhaps merely due to its abruptness)! Speaking of which, The Untouchables has this opening that raises the stakes higher than the film can actually manage as nothing else that happens throughout the rest of the story ever reaches that extreme. Well, other than maybe Ness throwing one of Capone's gangsters off the roof of the court building for insulting Malone (something which he apparently gets away with without consequences - but hey, its 1930s Chicago, I'll let it slide).There are a few moments which I thought were excellent though, the most famous of which being the train station stairway scene, an elaborate, unfolding, escalating series of events that in real-time probably only lasted 30 seconds or so, but gets drawn out to great effect as the baby in a pram tumbles down the stairs amidst a violent shootout as the child's mother watches on in horror. In a lesser film, it would be cheesy at best, but The Untouchables manages to sell it well.Other than that, the most I can say about the film is that its far from the best crime film I've ever seen - many of its elements seem borrowed and cobbled together from similar films and fiction - but its something a bit more than competent.Overall: 6 or 7/10 - Somewhere around there; maybe more, maybe less.",6,0,3,6 September 2019
Casino Royale," A slickly polished spy thriller...
","...with, as you'd expect, plenty of action - but with a surprising emphasis on tension and on tentative expectation as well (mostly to do with the high-stakes poker game which gives the film its namesake). The assured direction of the film also complements a well-written story with quality cinematography, a sympathetic but nonetheless imposing villain (played by the always wonderful Mads Mikkelsen) and a great deal of chemistry between Bond (played by Daniel Craig, who gives the character depth as simultaneously a suave gentlemen, cold killer, reckless rookie and troubled soul) and Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green), an enigmatic and intelligent counterpart to Bond. However, the film's biggest flaws are with some elements of its presentation and the dragging and slow final third or quarter. The film, despite being just over two hours long, maintains a good pace up until that last quarter of the film that is mostly made up of wedging in as much romance filler between Bond and Vesper as possible (as a means to drive home the impact of her betrayal and eventual death/suicide). That, to me, doesn't make sense, considering the film got across their romance just fine without it with a believable arc in their relationship with witty dialogue and mind games. My other criticisms are with the location title cards, which are a huge pet peeve of mine (Filmmakers, respect your audience's intelligence and use the establishing shot for what its named for - please!) and the spy tech and computer screens, which feels like low budget NCIS (yeah, that's a pretty negligible nitpick, but hey-ho, worth bringing up).Overall: 8/10, very very high 7 or low low 9",8,0,2,20 March 2019
Heat," Crime has (almost) never looked so good.
","A film so successful in its execution and, well...success, that it has been parodied and referenced to no end, in other heist films, in video games like the Grand Theft Auto series and even, arguably, real life. The film has been cited and blamed for real world robberies - most notably, the 1997 North Hollywood shootout. Whether or not it's impact was substantial enough for full-blown blame is up for debate. But it still goes to show just how far reaching the influence of Heat is.Now, I don't revere this film as much as other people might do. It's still great, don't get me wrong - it does a good job of managing its near three hour runtime, the brutality and realism of the famous shootout heist-gone-wrong scene is top notch and of course, the highlight of the entire film for me is the chemistry between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's characters which is showcased brilliantly in the coffee shop scene where this understated, soft music plays and then culminates into a more ominous moment where, though they share immense mutual respect between them, if it comes to it...they will both try to kill the other. And that scene is only part of the reason why this film is so acclaimed. There's also the romance between Robert De Niro's character and Eady, which is surprisingly touching, but much like the rest of the film, it has a tinge of darkness and sombreness to it when Eady discovers that Neil (De Niro) is a criminal and that she was blinded by her love and naivety. Finally, the way Heat demonstrates how easily and quickly criminal organisations can crumble is simple but effectively executed, where one mistake becomes the entire crew's downfall...leading to the death of Neil which, much like his romance, has heart to it with Al Pacino holding his hand as he passes on. It's a bit sappy, sure, but it works.The only major thing I can think of that I didn't like as much about it was the cinematography. It's serviceable, and does its job well...and if the film is of a high enough quality level like this one, it shouldn't matter that the cinematography isn't perfection incarnate. And besides, there's some interesting things Michael Mann does with lighting and shadows which especially comes into play in the tense climax at the end of the film. I just think it's one of Heat's weaker elements, as there isn't a whole lot that was particularly striking about it, taking everything into consideration.",8,1,1,1 August 2019
