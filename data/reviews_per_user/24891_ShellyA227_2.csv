Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The tradition continues.
","The Phantom Menace continues the Star Wars tradition.  From the 20th Century Fox roll-off and the prolog floating in space Lucas has followed his format. Many of the mysteries are revealed but just as many new questions are presented.  My group consisted of Star Wars experts and some who have not seen any of the stories since the first time around.  Each of us enjoyed many of the ironies presented.I certainly am one who pays more attention to the storyline than the acting; but I did enjoy both.  Keep in mind that this story takes place in what strikes me as a somewhat Roman culture.  The technology is supposed to be older than the Episodes 4, 5, and 6 equipment; and the characters did not grow up in the same troubled times that Luke and Leia did.  I believe many professional critics forgot this detail in their reviews such as 'the actors do not seem to be related to the characters of the earlier movies.'If you are interested enough to still be reading you should go see the movie.  The effects are excellent and the story is rich. Enjoy.",8,0,0,20 May 1999
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Dark Humor Done Right
","Despite the grim expectations from the story synopsis, the film delivers gore in a surprisingly tasteful way. There are no screaming teenagers running from a lunatic; instead we get a somewhat British blend of satire, slapstick and just 'wrong' humor. Although I'm not much of a Johnny Depp fan, I enjoyed his performance as well as Helena Bonham Carter's. Even the portrayal of the common clients was stunning.Despite being generally familiar with the story, I fell into some traps expecting specific twists, yet something different (and better) being delivered. This is a model of how to do dark humor that filmmakers should and probably will follow. It is most refreshing. Don't read the story and don't read any spoilers until you've seen it.",9,380,536,5 December 2007
