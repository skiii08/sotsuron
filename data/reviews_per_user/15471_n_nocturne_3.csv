The Ring," Be afraid, very afraid.
","I saw The Ring (Gore Verbinski, 2002) yesterday.I went by myself to the cinema, leaving my fianc√©e at home by herself (knowing that the movie would be far too much for her). I was almost an hour early and waited upstairs, staring blankly at a large TV whilst watching the trailers of countless movies to come. The hour passed swiftly and I was soon inside the cinema theatre, seated happily in my usual spot (yes, I'm one of those sad people that always sits in seat B12). No popcorn, just a half full bottle of cherry coke. The movie started ominously. The Dreamworks' logo crackled. Glee. Joy. Happiness. I'm a Ring fanatic.The original (Ringu, 1998) by Japanese director Hideo Nakata, chilled me to the bone. The sequel (Ringu 2, 1998) and prequel (Ringu 0, 2000) were equally potent. They're all members of that fading school of horror cinema in which blood makes almost no appearance (or if present, is a catalyst to the atmosphere, rather than a tool overused by the director to weed out the squeamish). I must admit at this point that I have not seen the Korean remake Ring Virus (1999) also known as Ring, but am planning on getting it from Hong Kong when I can scratch up enough cash to buy a few more oriental horror movies. It's high on my list.Back to the Hollywood English-language remake by Gore Verbinski: I was positively thrilled. He was almost entirely faithful to the Japanese version, but fortunately he also added to the entire Ringu mythology with certain elements. He anglicised others, changing the name Sadako to Samara for instance, and used Western imagery instead of Oriental. He added nice elements of symbolism such as the burning tree, the stagnant water that seeps through the floorboards and under doors, the entire equestrian idea, and others. Fortunately, they all worked well. Gore Verbinski did however add a little gore, taking a bloodless film and adding the odd writhed, decomposed body - a rare occurrence, granted (there is far less gore in this film than in the mainstream Se7en, 1995), but one that Nakata did not use. My feelings about this are quite mixed, but as a whole, I think I liked it.The best way to look at the 2002 remake version is to quite simply look at it as an entirely new film. If you do this, you will not be disappointed. If you look at it in the context of the Japanese versions (and Korean, I imagine), you will find this a thrilling appendix to the Ringu mythology. Either way, you will enjoy it. Unless you are part of that large group of people that actually ran out of the theatre half-way through the film yesterday afternoon. That is always a good sign.Personally, I found that the English-language remake version was as strong, if not stronger than either of the other sequels, but still remain adamant that the original Ringu is both more potent and horrifying than any of its offspring. This is the only horror film in which I have seen myself obliged to switch the light on to watch (I own Ringu, Ringu 2 and Ringu 0 on DVD). The final Sadako scene in Ringu is the most frightening, terrifying, chilling and unreal scene I have ever set eyes upon. Samara's final scene in The Ring is almost there, but this is where I must loudly voice my disapproval of Verbinski's handling of this scene: He cut it with the Rachel's car scene, dispelling in my eyes the uncut, continuous horror of Samara's appearance. This is in my eyes, the single flaw of the Verbinski version.I would recommend this film to all the horror fans out there. This is without a doubt an unforgettable movie and it will hopefully lead you onto a desire to watch the Japanese and Korean versions. Do not see this if you have even the slightest heart conditions or are easily spooked. You will run out of the cinema. Another word of warning: This is not an easy film to watch; it demands your entire commitment to the story and especially the atmosphere (the soundtrack is amazing). Do not watch this film (or its forefathers) on DVD whilst munching popcorn and chatting with your friends. This is not 'Watch over the weekend during a Horror movie marathon' material. Your attention is required from beginning to end, switch off the light, pull out the phone cord, close the doors, and be afraid. Be very afraid.I shall now go and build a little shrine to Ringu. Or I might go and watch it again.",7,0,0,1 March 2003
The Ring," Why another remake?
","Why another remake?Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed The Ring, a relatively good quality remake of the classic Japanese 'Ringu'. It was rather faithful to the original, made good use of atmospheric elements as well as providing a good setting for some fairly good acting. But, unfortunately, it was incapable of keeping the viewer's attention focused on the atmosphere and had to rely on what I deem cheap camera fast-panning tricks (*rapid movement* followed by 'Boo, are you scared yet?') and gore (blood/decomposing bodies), something that the original had none of, which leads me to believe that Hollywood is incapable of making a horror film that will keep the viewer on the edge of his/her seat without the use of these two rather amateurish features.This film does make me wonder why everytime a quality film is made in a non-Hollywood studio, America always has to vandalise this original piece of work and attempt to Americanise it by remaking it into a white-Caucasian, adrenaline joyride. Are our colonial cousins incapable of savouring an original piece of work in its original form? Or is this simply a testament to a fast-food culture where reading subtitles is simply too much effort?Anyway, I'm getting carried away once again. The Ring was a good remake of a classical masterpiece.However, do yourself a favour and stick with the original. It is far better.",7,0,1,9 October 2003
Event Horizon," Sam Neill at his best since 'In the mouth of madness'
","Having read a few of the comments on this film, I feel obliged to post my own opinion.It is my view that many of those who have claimed the film to be too bloody and gory did in fact not realize that it is primarily a horror film. Even though it possesses a sci-fi setting, this is but a mere catalyst to a genre which is finding it increasingly difficult to come up with original scripts. And on the mere basis of this, Event Horizon is ground-breaking.The film succeeds beautifully in creating a tense, nerve wrecking atmosphere that runs from a rather run of the mill first few minutes reminiscent of the likes of Alien, to fully fledged horror and terror rarely seen since The Exorcist. The sheer genius of this film is the director's ability to cast some of the most repulsive and disturbing Hellish visions since Hellraiser and then hint at something even worse underlying in the return of the Event Horizon. Truly impressive. A film hasn't made me feel this since Clive Barker's masterpiece.The cast was equally impressive. This is without a doubt Sam Neill's best performance since 'In the mouth of madness'. Every time I see this actor on screen, he just seems to get better. My hats off to him, he deserves a hand of applause if only for the 'eye gouge' scene.Good special effects, a dense and terrifying script and intrigue, a competent and appealing cast, some superb editing... and let us not mention the excellent sound effects and soundtrack.An excellent, spine-chilling film!",Null,0,1,4 April 2002
