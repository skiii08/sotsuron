Minority Report," restores faith in Steven Spielberg
","I'd been meaning to see this movie for a long time. Its constantly played now on the movie channels but I knew this one was worth catching from the beginning. Why? Because any point in the film has an appealing feel that sucks you in. That is truly the sign of a great movie.
Stevey Spielberg has not wasted his years in cinema. He has evolved in ways I'm unsure of how I can express. As a film student I find Spielberg amazingly fresh, a rare trait in a director let alone one as legend as himself. Spielberg surely still has it. The film itself has a feel like Blade Runner being futuristic with a man on the run. However Tom Cruise really brings a new element to it. His voice overs and serious tone work well for this movie. His acting is something other actors can rarely achieve, I truly doubt anyone can dislike him as an actor (cept for perhaps the extremely jealous). The film brings up several issues about the way we've conducted ourselves in the past and where we're going as a race in this 'jetson'-like future we're creating for ourselves. Spielberg seems to be interested in the future taking Kubrick's AI and now this, however his new obsession is not one which takes away from his films. I give it a 9 out of 10. Amazing film. Worth watching several times!",9,0,0,31 July 2003
28 Days Later...," My friends couldn't speak for 10 minutes...
","No, that's really a story my friends told me. And then my friend brought me out to see this movie over seeing T3. Was I glad I did so? You bet I was.28 Days Later has nothing to do with Resident Evil. In fact, the comparisons are obvious but 28 Days Later was made for a better reason, 28 Days Later is like a collection of all of the Zombie films you've ever seen made in a fresh and interesting way.Unlike Resident Evil, the powering force of Danny Boyle who brought us Trainspotting is behind this one. Oddly enough, people compare this film to Resident Evil endlessly but the film starts out where 12 Monkeys would leave it off. I find it funny that no one has made that comparison.
So, essentially what 28 Days Later is, is what Resident Evil 2 will be, but in London. People who dislike this movie will really SHlT a brick when RE2 comes out and it's.... uht oh... semi-based off a video game where the city is dead! OH NO! But these are just people who tend to complain, don't let them throw you off.Making a horror movie is very hard but this movie pushes all the right buttons and even the buttons Resident Evil didn't get to push. You see Resident Evil was made to appease to video game fans as well as fans of horror films. This movie was made to appease fans of cinema as well as the horror sub genre of Zombie Film (even though it's also a Sci-Fi sub genre, but we won't get into that.)The camera in this film captures moments in time and makes the sure moments of horror beautiful. Everything I wanted to happen... happened. The music fits perfectly with the film, the film converys lights in a beautiful way and all the while the city being empty seems horrifying even if we're not british. It all fits together at the right moment.Of course all the while you have to keep in mind our civilization is not too far away from 28 Days Later. I mean, how impossible is it for one of the American Testing labs in Boston on the MIT campus to accidentally release an animal onto Boston and cause a widespread disease that would have to be quarantined from the rest of the America, and the world? Surely not far off. Anything's possible.This movie truly blew me away. I've been waiting for this movie to come out for a while and it was worth every second of my wait and more. I feel in a way it was a foreign film because Danny Boyle shot it in British fashion which made every second of it even more beautiful.I truly believe anyone who disliked this movie is a person who feels the need to be negative as a critic or simply does not have interest in cinema as an art. 28 Days later is truly a beautiful movie, it is Art-Cinema in an apocalyptic way. Resident Evil is a great American action film and 28 Days Later is an amazing and beautiful art-cinema film from Danny Boyle, our favorite British director. Both are in the same genre, and both are very good films for their genre.I like how they connect and I think Danny did it purposely. To dislike this film is to have no taste in cinema. I'm sure the same people who hate 28 Days Later also hate Run Lola Run and would somehow find a way to hate Battle Royale and every other amazing foreign film. See this film, don't listen to your stoner friends who disliked it. But even that may be a misstatement, because I'm not even sure how a stoner could dislike this movie. It is truthfully beyond me how anyone can dislike this amazing piece of cinema.",9,0,0,6 July 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," well done. mike and charlie do it well!
","I went into this movie unsure what to expect. Of course, I've been waiting for this film to come out for quite a long time. So any vision of the film really was hard for me to come up with.The first five minutes rolled and I feel in love with Kate Winslet's character. And everything else just fell into place.The movie gets down well what it's like to be in a relationship, and how relationships fall apart. When they invent this type of surgery in real life i'm sure they'll be plenty of people wanting to get it, and I'm sure it'll cause some great chaos. If stem cell research which actually can save lives and improve the world is getting flack from insane right-winged people, then this type of thing would as well, but it's a great concept and very possible.The film itself takes on a life of it's own. I'd like to see it again just to absorb it into my skin. I love this film as much as I thought I would. Anyone can love this film. As long as you have a span of attention...see this film. It's well made and well written and true to the heart. If you have no sense of good cinema and just want Britney Spears and MTV to combine again... stay home and cry for yourself.",8,0,1,19 March 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Better than the first!
","The Matrix is one of the all-time greatest movies ever. I don't know anyone who would really dispute this fact. Well actually I do, but I think their totally wrong. The storyline is advanced beyond anything I've seen in recent mainstream cinema in America. The story itself is so intertwined with the animatrix and the video games, all adding into the side story, that it is more of a fans movie than anything (just my favorite.)Hell the Matrix is on the cover of my textbook for my cinema classes. This movie is amazing. The special effects are top-notch and timeless. The plotline actually IS amazing. I don't know what you would expect other than action from an action movie...the fact that they could intertwine this action with such an amazing plotline blows me away. I didn't get into the movie KNOWING the plot so I walked out AMAZED. The Matrix Reloaded blows away every expectation I had for the movie. This is what some people dislike because they want cinema to simply go their way. If their expectations are not met they are not pleased. But truly mind-blowing cinema destroys your expectations. That is what the Matrix Reloaded does. It blows away expectations and ends on a note that makes you WANT to return. I mean come on, if it ended with conclusion, wouldn't that make the third film in the trilogy pointless? And honestly, it's only a few months in-between them coming out, I think you can live with waiting. So in conclusion, it is only the disappointed and impatient movie-goers that will dislike this movie. The Matrix Reloaded is more amazing than I could describe. If you haven't seen it, YOU NEED TO.",Null,0,0,25 May 2003
Vanilla Sky," I just wanted to Thank Cameron.....
","I've already commented on this movie before. Somewhere on this little board of comments is my comment about how this is an amazing movie which I will defend to the death. After watching it again, I just wanted to thank Cameron Crowe for creating this movie, and this time leave not my IMDB alias but my name as my signature here. This movie means a lot to me. It has moved me many times and inspires me as reason to create cinema. There are movies you watch and there are movies you live, and this is the latter. The films Cameron has created mean a great deal to me and have been inspiration to go to film school and continue to write.
I thought maybe one day Cameron might read this. Or somebody who knew him would. So please, thank him for me, for creating something so pure that you can actually call it real. Thank you Cameron, from the bottom of my heart to the reaches of my soul, thank you. This movie means more to me than words can describe and I think you meant it this way. Ha, stealing a line from the movie, 'well ya know, if you can reach one person', but you know you've done more than that. Thank You.",10,0,1,22 July 2003
Vanilla Sky," Another AMAZING Cameron Crowe Film
","Cameron Crowe does it again in this amazing film. Vanilla Sky is what made Tom Cruise worthy of my respect. I mean being in a Cameron Crowe film is like being in a piece of rock history. The references of course to Radiohead and other amazing bands and the comparison to citizen Kane in a modern way could only be done in such a fashionable and interesting way by Cameron Crowe. I can't think of anything I would dislike about this movie. It confuses the slowest of people; If you wanted Top Gun you shouldn't see this movie. Tom Cruise is an amazing actor and the days of Top Gun 80s flicks are over. Tom Cruise gains the respect of the art community with this film.
Tom Cruise in this film plays a man who has everything. The man ultimately finds himself in some sort of conspiracy but his world is twisted and twilight zone like. When hes unable to trust even his own memory he questions his own reality...and the story just goes down the rabbit hole. It's hard not to like this movie unless your the type who likes to watch a film once and forget about it. You can't watch this movie and not think about it. The film has an ability to twist you and amaze you.
You could get lost and confused, I know alot of people did, but this movie is one you'll definitely want to own. Unless you like to watch American movies that just pet you on the head and star Martin Lawerence. This isn't an action movie, its a mainstream art movie. Unfortunately when you go to the mainstream with cinema-art you confuse half the dumb-witted who just DONT WANT THEIR LEVEL OF QUESTIONING raised. Jason Lee has an amazing performance in it, every character plays a key role and just leaves themselves in your psyche. Vanilla Sky is not a movie you can explain, you must experience it. I saw it once and watched it immediately again. And then the next day. Probably seven or eight times in the first week. It amazed me, it inspired me. Cameron Crowe, you truly are my hero. Everyone should watch this movie, even if you know you won't get it.",10,0,1,11 June 2003
Back to the Future," WHY this is the GREATEST triology ever.
","Okay so claiming something the greatest trilogy ever is a huge claim. I'll admit that, but I'd never have become a film student if it wasn't for Back To The Future....and that's right, not just Pt1, ALL THREE. Now let me explain....As a child Back To The Future held my attention like nothing else. Every second was like a magical moment. I remember very distinctly when I saw BTTF2 and BTTF3 in the movie theaters; they were two of my greatest childhood memories. I feel honored that I could even see such great movies in the theaters. Makes me feel bad about the kids who are gonna have memories of Jennifer Lopez movies...Marty Mcfly is a kid. He has a crappy family and doesn't know why. He doesn't have a car and doesn't know why. But he faces everyday troubles and hes really not that bad of a guy at the beginning of the movie. Despite his parents troubles Marty has grown up fine.Marty however has a friend who's strange but a genius named Doc who accidentally sends him back to 1955 where he sees his parents grow up? The small things that the parents do in the long run catch up to them. The small decisions in childhood affect their entire futures.As a kid, Marty grew up in the same time as myself and then travels to the two places you know you always wanted to go as a kid.... the mid 1950s, The Future and The Wild West. I mean I know I wanted to, that's why I played all three video games. Back To The Future has a nostalgic sense even if you weren't born in the 80s because it's done so well. The emotions are pretty much universal, especially for those who grow up in small towns/suburbia --- to see what your town was like in the future and the past....wouldn't that be amazing? ESPECIALLY amazing to see while you're growing up and still connected to the town (via school, etc...) Each movie in this trilogy has its own charm. It's hard to pick a favorite (but the first one IS really the best. I mean come on; you can't appreciate the changes in time if you don't see the first movie.)Now talking about this film on the level of a film student, this film is amazing. The motifs are done very well, The Mayor, The Clocktower, Doc's House, Marty's family growing and changing, The Cafe where Marty always goes to eat no matter what time it is. There's so many motifs that you only notice subconsciously unless your looking for them, but THEY are definitely there.Any lesser director would have just made up fancy looking things for the future. Made an old looking set for the past. BUT NO! This combination does it right. Returning the same place in different time, you ultimately see how time changes things and therefore you see the true cause and effect of life through time travel.The underlying concept of the movie - The small things change everything. Marty's scolds his mother for smoking and drinking so much as a teenager...and she doesn't grow up to be an ugly alcoholic. Marty makes his dad more confident...and he overcomes other challenges in life and isn't a greasy dork at 40. I mean it's a lot like the cause and effect idea that the TV show Quantum Leap uses (and LET ME TELL YOU that show does time travel sooooo right.)Anyone who says the sequels to Back To The Future sucked, or don't live up to the first one are just wrong. Their not looking and their judging it the wrong way. You can't watch Back To The Future with the judging eye filled with contempt the jaded pop culture of the now would give you. You must watch BTTF with the open eye of an awed film go-er. And then you will love the trilogy.This movie made Robert Zemeckis one of my personal heroes. Bob Gale as well. Bob Gale went on the write for Daredevil amongst a few other comics and is well respected in the comic world and you can clearly see why in this movie. IF YOU READ COMIC BOOKS you can see Zemeckis creates shots like in panels. Gale and Zemeckis seem to click in a unique and perfect way. There's not one thing you could change about this series. It's perfect the way it is. I'm just glad IMDB exists so I could express how much I love this series for how great of a movie is. The movie keeps your interest because the subject matter is great. The movie keeps long lasting appeal because it is well done and the motifs are great. IMDB only gives me 1,000 words to express how great this film is. And that's far too few.If you haven't seen these movies your already in the past.
(HA! But I had to throw a cheap pun in there. I mean it is the 80s we're reflecting on....although this movie doesn't even have any of those. So maybe I'm behind....)=)",10,1,2,20 May 2003
