Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Conclusion to A Masterpiece
","It's hard to review Kill Bill, Volume 2 without mentioning Volume 1, since both films make up an entire movie. So instead of just reviewing Volume 2, I shall end up combining the two films and submitting a review of Kill Bill. So let us begin. Kill Bill is Quentin Tarantino's bloody epic masterpiece that pays homage to those 70's Japanese shows, Spaghetti Westerns and Italian Horror Films. He combines the three elements to create a masterful story of revenge, featuring Uma Thurman as The Bride. The Bride is an interesting character who is indeed a woman of the world. She was about to get married and have a baby and ended up being massacred by Bill and The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (composed of Elle Driver, Budd, O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green) and left in a coma for four years. She wakes up and immediately wants revenge on all those who ruined her lives. What results is approximately 4 hours and 8 minutes (that's what you get if you add the two films together) of action-packed, in-your face drama that can't get any better. Quentin Tarantino is a masterful writer and director that one can compare to Martin Scorsese. He is totally original in what he creates and doesn't hold anything back from the audience. He shoves it in your face and all you can do is squeal when he does it. Uma Thurman delivers quite possibly the best performance of her career (the only one better maybe occurs in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction) and honestly richly deserves a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her work in this epic film. But what is really the centerpiece of this whole entourage of violence and blood is the character of Bill. One would expect bill to be such a hard-ass, a man so violent and so insane that you wouldn't be able to like him at all. Yet Tarantino creates him as an intelligent, sweet, loving man who feels sincere regret for what he did to The Bride. The man who plays him is David Carradine, son of the legendary John Carradine, whom, like John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, Tarantino resurrects with this film. Carradine plays Bill so well in Volume 2 that he too deserves a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his work in this film. Tarantino's writing and direction are nearly flawless in this movie, the editing of the film is spectacular, the cinematography is absolutely stunning, all making Kill Bill a vast, beautiful tale that is more than just about revenge. Volume 1 was a bloody masterpiece, Volume 2 was a beautiful masterpiece, Kill Bill is One of the Very Best Films Ever!

Ali," Less than what I expected
","Ali was one of the worst films of the year last year. I was surprised to see that it was nominated for 2 oscars. Sure, Will Smith's performance was absolutely stunning. I believe he did a tremendous job in playing Ali. However, I believe that the screenplay was awful. It showed me stuff that I already knew about Ali and exaggerated it over and over and over again. The final scene in which Ali fights George Foreman makes you want to fall asleep. It takes so damn long and looks so damn boring. There was no dialogue during that scene. There were many other sequences that seemed very boring. All except the sex scene between Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. That was probably the best part of the movie. Now, don't get me wrong, if you don't know anything about Ali, it is absolutely phenomenal. However, if you know something, don't see it. Michael Mann directs Ali as if it were for dummies. Seriously, do not see this film because you will waist 3 hours out of your life. (which is how long the film is)",5,0,0,14 May 2002
Citizen Kane," a compelling picture of epic quality
","Citizen Kane is truly an American cinema classic. Combined with a brilliant performance by Orson Welles (who also directed, produced, and co-wrote this film)and an amazing story, Citizen Kane brings a sense of power to the screen. It is truly the inspiration for anyone who wants to direct. This is so because this was Orson Welles's first film. Nominated for 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay. (Orson Welles should have won for Best Actor), it ranks as an essential film in the history of cinema. However, the only thing that brings down this picture is trying to understand what the term Rosebud means at the end of the movie. I know that Rosebud was his sled, but how does that describe his life? In spite of that minor detail, Citizen Kane ranks as the second best film ever made, second only to Gone with the Wind.",10,0,1,13 May 2002
The Girl Next Door," Not good but not bad
","The Girl Next Door is more than what it had been advertised. Fox chose to market it as a sex comedy, but indeed this film is way more than that. It follows in the footsteps of Risky Business and American Pie and does something that few sex comedies do anymore; give depth to the story. But that doesn't mean that the story is any good. In fact, it is so unrealistic and so overwritten that the film itself starts to get boring. The first half-hour is the most interesting because you care about the characters. However, when they drag in scenes like the one in Las Vegas or the robbery scene, then the story just dwindles so far down into a bottomless pit of nothingness. The screenplay does have some clever nuances like the creation of a new and totally original sex-ed video which would send shockwaves around the country if such a tape were ever released. But at the heart of the story is the relationship between Matthew and Danielle (played well by Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert) which is the most thoughtful thing about this film. But the story drags away from that and slips away from being more decent than it could have been. However, the film is better already in the fact that it is not just a flat sex comedy because then the film would not have any depth whatsoever. So I give credit to the writer and the director for making that happen. However, I guess I have to say that such depth is not enough to make this film good. Lenny's Grade: C+",5,0,0,26 August 2004
We Were Soldiers," A riveting, compelling war drama
","We Were Soldiers is an intense drama set during the vastness of the Vietnam War. The story does not only focus on the grave depiction of this war, but also focuses on the lives of the American soldiers. The audience is able to realize that lots of these men who fought bravely were fathers to their children and husbands to their wives. They were willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of their country and fight for a nation they could be proud of. Mel Gibson is one of those soldiers (Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore) who must also leave his life behind and lead these young soldiers into the heart of doom. Writer/director Randall Wallace does a wonderful job at bringing the devastation of war and the emotion of soldiers to an even match and turns the film into an amazing portrait of the American spirit. He doesn't just make us absorb the harshness of war in which there is a good and an evil. Wallace makes us feel sorry not just for the American soldiers, but also for the enemy soldiers who are also sacrificing their lives for the good of their country. We realize that it is not their choice to fight in this war and are made to believe that it is a matter of duty and honor. Earlier in the film, Moore describes the soldiers as 'young boys' who are being shed into a hellacious mixture of death and agony. This line allows the audience to feel proud for these young soldiers who fought for their nation. Moore also makes a promise that he will bring every man under his command home (dead or alive) 'so help him God'. We learn from this line at the end of the movie that Moore was indeed a man of his word and would die to see that these young boys made it home. Randall Wallace tells of the story of 7th company with such effectiveness and power that the audience must shed a tear at the end. Indeed, Wallace has improved himself ever since he wrote the disastrous screenplay for Pearl Harbor. I would not be surprised if this film was not recognized at the end of the year as one of the best films of the year. Lenny's Grade: ***1/2",7,1,2,25 August 2002
The Polar Express," Vivid and imaginative
","The Polar Express is indeed a vivid and imaginative film created by Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis. It is a stunning adaptation of a holiday classic that will be cherished by many for years to come. This is indeed the ideal Christmas story about a young boy who doubts the existence of Santa Claus. On Christmas Eve, the boy encounters a massive locomotive known as The Polar Express, which guarantees a round-trip ride to the North Pole. The boy is reluctant at first but then decides to board the train perhaps because he is curious or perhaps because deep inside his heart there is still the belief in the unrealistic. While on board, the boy encounters a variety of characters including the appearance of a ghostly hobo, who teaches him that seeing is believing. However, the boy still has many questions which no one has the answer to except himself. Throughout the film, he goes on a journey of self-discovery and decides at the very end whether or not he still believes. The film has heart and is both touching and magnificent. Tom Hanks plays six characters in the film but does his best work as the conductor, who doesn't need proof that seeing is believing. There is also the appearance of the dead toy car, in which there are various amounts of toys that have been neglected over the years. The scene is both haunting and filled with sorrow at the same time. Yet the most touching sequence comes when the boy receives the first gift from Santa Claus towards the end of the film. The boy receives proof that some parts of life are not fantasy and learns that all of us must have faith in whatever you believe. Not only is the film powerful emotionally but it is also a visual wonder. Robert Zemeckis has used the remarkable technology of performance capture to create a world so genuine and realistic that you begin to question if the film is animated or not. It is a roller-coaster ride of adventure and Christmas spirit that never ceases to amaze. Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis have taught us to believe in the Christmas spirit with this magnificent adaptation of The Polar Express. The film will definitely go down in the annals of such Christmas classics as It's a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th Street. Terrific, Terrific Film-making!

Lost in Translation," A terrific film
","Lost in Translation is indeed one of the best films of the year. Bill Murray gives him a performance that clearly defines what it is to be an actor. The writing and the directing by Sofia Coppola is nothing short of brilliant. Scarlet Johannson will go on to be one of America's premier actresses because of this one film. Indeed, Lost in Translation is a film that will be remembered as an original, genuine, and magnificent story about two people lost in the midst of the Japanese world. It deserved all the praise that it got from America's best critics and Bill Murray deserved his Oscar nomination, as did Sofia Coppola for Best Director. Don't be surprised if by the time I've seen every Oscar-nominated film that Lost in Translation beats out Return of the King as my favorite film of the year.",8,0,1,14 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A magnificent vision
","Many years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a series of novels that swept the literary world off its feet. They were stories of magical worlds littered with creatures we can only see in our imaginations. Tolkien created an epic adventure such as the world has never known and he called them The Lord of the Rings. Years later, Peter Jackson took the first part of that epic saga and made it into a film such as the world has never seen. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an adventure story about a dark lord named Sauron who creates a ring so that he can control all of Middle Earth. Sauron loses the ring and it eventually winds up in the hands of one Frodo Baggins, a hobbit who has lived in peace for all of his life. Like his uncle before him (Bilbo Baggins), Frodo wants the sense of adventure in his life and wants to explore more than what his eyes can see. That is exactly what happens to him in the worst of ways when Bilbo bequeaths to him a Ring of mysterious power and origin. Eventually, we discover that the Ring is indeed the Ring of Power crafted by Sauron himself. Gandalf, Frodo's old wizard friend, tells him that the Ring must be destroyed or all of Middle Earth will fall under the might of Sauron. Henceforth, Frodo sets out to destroy the Ring with his hobbit friends (Merry, Pippen, and Sam) and winds up in many sorts of adventures which lead to massive sorrow and pain. There is much more to the story than what I am telling you and I won't tell you because much of it is surprise and littered with all sorts of action and adventure. Elijah Wood (who plays Frodo in the film) gives an honest performance and could have received a Best Actor nomination. The writers intend to make the audience believe that Frodo is us, as a human being, and the way that he looks at this is the way that we would look at it. The Fellowship of the Ring is a vivid and magnificent adaptation to Tolkiens's own masterpiece and Peter Jackson has created a world that we will never forget in our minds. He has taken a novel one could only picture in their imaginations and made it into a film that stretches the boundaries of cinema. He has used the computer to create creatures from another world and has done it with great success. He has made a picture that will be considered one of the best epic motion pictures of all time that goes along with such classics as Ben Hur and Gone with the Wind. If Mr. Tolkien were alive today, he would be astounded by the amazing vision of Peter Jackson for his novel and would be proud to have written such a wonderful classic. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is indeed a film which should not be missed by any die hard movie fan across America.Lenny's Grade: ****",10,1,1,11 August 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Good, Not Great
","Those looking for extreme action this summer best catch a glimpse at Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. This is a movie that features pure action and nothing more. There are massive gun fights, car chases, explosions, the whole lot. T3 is a fast-paced action thriller that grabs you and never lets go. Arnold Schwarzenegger looks great for a 55-year old man and kicks serious ass in this film. Kristanna Lohken (who plays the T-X) is a sexy villain who enjoys kicking Arnold's ass all over the place (including a bathroom stall). So for those looking for nothing but action will truly get their money's worth after seeing this movie. However, I prefer to look for more than action. I want to see just a slight bit of drama in this type of movie. T3 offers little to no drama except at the very end of the film (I will not reveal the ending because it is a surprise) Even so, you could probably see the ending coming since Arnold's character keeps hinting at it throughout the film. That is where T3 falters as a picture. The screenplay is so predictable and carries too many cliches. Also, there are too many comical lines which damage the film's credibility. As a result, what you see on the screen is a full-scaled action picture littered with explosive stunts and amazing special effects. T3 does not have the James Cameron touch that was present in the first two films which weakens it as well. T2 was much better because it was able to incorporate more emotion between John Connor and the Terminator all while presenting you with explosive stunts and special effects. Frankly, I missed Edward Furlong playing John Connor. He gave an incredible performance in T2 and Nick Stahl's portrayal is weak with no emotion whatsoever. It feels like he's trying his best not to act but to just get through his lines, which he can't do because of the weak screenplay. Claire Danes's character of Kate Brewster shows some emotion but not enough to make you feel for your loss. The only time you feel eligible to shed a tear is at the very end of the film.
Yet I believe that T3's pure action method saves it from becoming a failure of a movie which I why I praise it. It is a film solely for the people who want action and only action. It is also for the people who want to see Arnold kick a woman's ass and the woman kicking his ass as well. Although there is no drama, T3 is able to successfully continue the action half of the Terminator franchise which makes it a good film but not great.

Gone with the Wind," The best film of all time
","Gone with the Wind is indeed the best film in the history of American cinema. Filled with compelling performances by Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, Gone with the Wind provides a sense of highly involved drama mixed with a blend of comedy to make it a delightful picture. The winner of 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1939, Gone with the Wind is not only the greatest motion picture ever to hit the American cinema, but it is the highest grossing motion picture in world history. Gone with the Wind is driven by a wonderful screenplay and captivating directing to make it a true classic among classics.",10,1,1,13 May 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Sheer Brilliance
","Saving Private Ryan is one of the best films I have ever seen. The direction by Steven Spielberg for this film is absolutely brilliant and the performances by every essential cast member are breathtaking and unforgettable. Spielberg graphically shows the harsh realities of war and the brotherhood of every soldier involved. Tom Hank's performance in this film is a work of art, a brilliant performance by a brilliant actor. The screenplay is successfully written and provides a hell of a story. It is because of these key elements that the film is brilliant. It is truly one of Spielberg's best works. However, the only thing wrong with this film are the occasional hilarities of the film. They sometimes drag off the importance of this story and what the director hopes to achieve from this. Other than that, the film is one of the best films ever made and should have won the Best Picture of 1998.",9,0,0,27 May 2002
Shrek 2," Fantastic
","Shrek 2 is simply one of the best comedies of the year. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz are fantastic once again in the roles of Shrek, Donkey, and Princess Fiona. The writing is superlative and witty and the film itself is absolutely hilarious. It all begins when Shrek and Fiona are summoned to the magical kingdom of Far Far Away by Fiona's parents, who are appropriately titled the King and the Queen. It is apparent from the start of the film that Shrek and the King don't like each other and that no one seems to care about Fiona's feelings. There is also the appearance of a Fairy Godmother, who would seem to care about Shrek and Fiona but really doesn't. It turns out that she is the Fairy Godmother from Hell and she wants her son, Prince Charming, to marry Fiona instead of Shrek. That way, she can obtain more power for herself. As a result, the King and the Fairy Godmother hire an assassin called Puss in Boots to kill Shrek. The assassination attempt is perhaps one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a long time. Antonio Banderas is absolutely wonderful as Puss and should garner the same type of praise that Ellen Degeneres got for Finding Nemo. The story plays out with some other clever and totally funny sequences, including the appearance of a giant ginger-bread man named Mongo, and ends up with the King accepting Shrek and everything turning out to be happily ever after. The film is filled with great performances from John Cleese as the King, Julie Andrews as the Queen and Rupert Everett as Prince Charming. Shrek 2 is not as original as the first Shrek, but it comes pretty damn close. Lenny's Grade: A",7,1,2,7 November 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A Brilliant Film
","From the acclaimed writer of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation comes Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, a magnificent romance story with so many twists and turns its unbelievable to watch. Jim Carrey gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Joel, who becomes attached to a young and somewhat bizarre woman named Clementine, played perfectly by Kate Winslet. The pair experience a bizarre connection with one another and gradually begin to fall in love. However, when Clementine decides to have Joel erased from her memory because she finds him boring, the story unravels into something more complicated than a romance story but rather an exciting odyssey into the deepest and darkest regions of the human psyche. As a result, Joel decides to have Clementine erased from his memory. However, as the process escalates throughout the course of the film, Joel discovers that he cannot live without Clementine and wants to end the process. What results is a masterful film that should definitely get Oscar nominations for Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. Charlie Kaufman has written yet another brilliant screenplay and is probably going to receive his third Oscar nomination for this film. Hopefully, the third time is the charm and he will finally win the Oscar because he is quite simply a brilliant, sophisticated, and totally original writer. Accolades to Charlie Kaufman and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Lenny's Grade: A",8,0,2,2 November 2004
From Hell," Visually Stunning
","From Hell is a gruesome portrait of murder in London during the reign of Queen Victoria. It tells the story of Jack the Ripper, a psychotic individual who murdered 5 prostitutes. Johnny Depp is brilliant as the inspector who tries to hunt him down and delivers one of the best performances of his career. The story is well written by the Hughes Brothers and is a truly enjoyable film for anyone who loves the horror genre. However, it is the predictability of this film and the performance of Heather Graham which provides From Hell with a downfall. The spoken dialogue between Depp and a good doctor lets you easily figure out who the murderer is. It does not supply the audience with a surprise or twist. Heather Graham's performance is purely simple and does not illustrate her capable talent. She does not deliver a well-rounded performance as Mary Kelly (also a prostitute) because she does not show essential emotion (i.e. fear) in order to fulfill her role. However, the film is an exceptional horror picture and should not be overlooked by any fan of movies.",6,2,2,27 May 2002
Titanic," a remarkable picture
","Titanic is one of the best films ever made. it contains stunning performances by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet. there are many scenes in this picture that make you want to cry, particularly the scene where Rose says she'll never let go of Jack forever. It is one of the most touching scenes in the history of American cinema and Titanic is truly a classic among classics. It ranks as James Cameron's best film to date and will continue to be one of my favorite films. The winner of 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1997, Titanic truly ranks among classic films such as Gone with the Wind and The Godfather.",10,0,3,13 May 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," A Heartwarming Tale That's Filled With Love
","As much as I love the cinema and all the gossip that comes with the cinema, I must confess that I had never seen It's a Wonderful Life until just recently. That's shocking for me because I love movies so much and I'm a big fan of the classics. I had heard that the film was a Christmas classic and one of the most heartwarming films ever made and I must say that everything that people say about this masterpiece is absolutely true. It's a Wonderful Life is filled with so many great things that one cannot feel humbled to be watching such a brilliant film. First of all, Jimmy Stewart's performance is one of the best ever given in the history of cinema. His portrayal of a broken-down loan officer named George Bailey is profound and deeply moving. He captures the essence of the character's personality and makes the audience literally weep for this man. The character of George Bailey is written as if he was the nicest and most generous person you could ever meet in your lifetime. And yet for some reason he is never able to catch a break and every stroke of luck that he receives just vanishes into thin air. Jimmy Stewart is perfect for that part because it seems as if he is just the sweetest guy you could ever meet in your lifetime and to witness him being swallowed into an inescapable black hole of bad luck is heart-wrenching and sorrowful. We feel sorry for George Bailey because we know how great a man he is. So when Uncle Billy misplaces that $8,000 deposit and George is literally petrified of what could happen to him, he loses his mind and contemplates suicide. Without the assistance of George's guardian angel named Clarence (who is only a second-class angel because he doesn't have his wings), George would never have realized just how great a person he really is and how wonderful a life he has. Jimmy Stewart's performance is richly detailed and he plays the nice-guy level so perfectly in this film that it makes the audience cry at the very end of the film. Frank Capra's direction of the film is flawless as always. He uses many layers of film-making to tell us this imaginative story and creates a masterful work of art. There are terrific supporting performances from Donna Reed as George's wife, Mary and especially from Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter. Barrymore is perfect in this film as the villainous Mr. Potter who controls everything in Bedford Falls except for the Bailey Bank & Loan. The scenes with Barrymore and Stewart are absolutely unforgettable and you love to see Potter suffer at the end of the film because he is indeed the meanest man you could ever meet in your life. The writing is masterful and imaginative and gives the film its heartbeat. It tells the story of a man who deserves to be rewarded in life but instead stands aside and cares for the welfare of others. He doesn't realize that his life is worth something until the very end of the film when everyone in Bedford Falls (except Mr. Potter) bails him out of his problem. It is then that he realizes that his ship has come in and he is now being rewarded for all the good deeds he has done. The film is inspirational and makes us realize that we should always have hope because without hope, we can never be able to realize just how wonderful life can truly be. 'No man is a failure who has friends' That is the basic moral of It's a Wonderful Life and it teaches us that you don't need money to be happy. The film is not necessarily a Christmas movie but it still preaches the ideology of the holiday and that is what characterizes it as a Christmas film. Indeed, it is perhaps the greatest Christmas movie of all time and one of the best films ever made in my opinion. Thank You Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart for giving us this masterpiece of the cinema.Lenny's Grade: A+",10,1,5,25 December 2004
Ray," Amazing
","I have seen a lot of biography films. What's good about them is that they always focus on the title character. Whether it was Muhammad Ali or Malcolm X, the director would never focus on the supporting characters. I guess that is the purpose of a biographical film, but nevertheless it should still focus not just plainly on the title character but also on the lives of the supporting characters as well. That being said, Ray is an amazing biographical film. Director Taylor Hackford and Jamie Foxx have created a celebration of the life of Ray Charles Robinson and everyone who is a true movie-lover should experience this film. I have never seen such flawless acting and such great storytelling ever on the big screen. That says a lot about the power and the glory of this film. The story is about the life of Ray Charles Robinson, a black man growing up in the rural areas of South Florida who experiences the tragic death of his brother, George. As a result of that experience, Ray goes blind and must learn to get around by using his memory. Encouraged by his mother, he is able to not be treated as a cripple but rather becomes a smart and witty individual by the time he reaches Seattle. However, the disturbing images of his brother's death still haunt him and as a result, he becomes addicted to heroin. Director Taylor Hackford does a great job at analyzing the dark side of Ray's past and doesn't just focus on the glorious music written by him. Speaking of the music, I think it was an excellent decision to not have Jamie Foxx sing the music because then it would lack originality. I was very proud to hear the voice of Ray Charles sing the music for this film. It was as if he had come down from heaven to give us one final performance. That was an amazing experience. Now, on to the performances. To start off this paragraph, let me just say that Jamie Foxx gives perhaps the best performance of his career. Not only is he able to capture the extraordinarily complicated mental state of Ray Charles, but he is also able to capture the physical aspect of Charles as well. From shaking around while playing the piano to wearing prosthetics to enhance the blinding effect, Foxx does it all as he goes for Oscar glory with this film. Indeed, Jamie Foxx deserves a Best Actor nomination for his work and, barring any setbacks, should win the Oscar for this film. There are also terrific supporting performances in this film from Kerry Washington as Ray's wife and Regina King as his lover. Clearly, they were two extraordinary women whom Ray loved with a passion and both Washington and King do excellent work in capturing their personalities. In fact, I believe that Washington should garner a Best Supporting Actress nomination for this film because I felt that she and Foxx had great chemistry together and that enhanced the powerful effect of the film itself.The directing is flawless. The writing is superlative. The musical sequences are absolutely unforgettable. And the acting, well, the acting is a work of art. Accolades to Taylor Hackford, Jamie Foxx and the rest of the cast for creating such a great film. Oh, and thank you Ray Charles Robinson for your great personality and your great music. We miss you and we love you.Lenny's Grade: A-",8,1,2,14 November 2004
Vanilla Sky," Rather Confusing
","Vanilla Sky is a very confusing picture. You have to really watch the film in order to understand what is going on. The film was indeed a good film and Tom Cruise delivers an exceptional performance. However, the screenplay is poorly written and the ending is poor in general. Writer/Director Cameron Crowe should have rewrote the ending in order to make the film more enjoyable. Indeed the film is filled with twists and surprises. There are some things that you don't expect are coming. However, it is the ending which kills this movie. Vanilla Sky would not be a movie I would recommend because lots of people would be sitting there looking at this movie and plainly just not getting it. They would also believe that the ending is just plain crappy.",5,0,0,27 May 2002
Amélie," A delightful romantic comedy
","When watching foreign language films, I like to experience them in their native language rather than in the English-dubbed version. If it is dubbed, it takes away the sense of originality and beauty that was intended to be portrayed to the audience in the original script. It allows for the performances to be more accurate and at the same time, more enjoyable. In Amelie, we are taken through the lifestyle of a woman with a huge imagination who in reality is only a waitress at a small French coffee shop. We are taught to believe that she does not care about the huge things in life, which in this film is Princess Diana's death, and that she only cares about the people around her. Throughout the film, she tries to help them improve their lives and in the process, try to improve her own. It is a beautiful portrait of the human spirit and how one person can make a difference in another person's life. Amelie was played by a lovely French actress named Audrey Tatou, whom in my opinion should have garnered a Best Actress nomination for this movie. She is able to successfully portray a shy woman who is willing to do anything to see her friends happy. Amelie uses clever tactics to enlighten the people she loves and irritate the people she hates. However, until the very end of the movie, her shy personality prevents her from experiencing happiness of her own. Amelie is indeed one of the best films you'll see this year and is a witty, delightful, and well-written romantic comedy. Also, the camera angles that we see in this film are spectacular and allow for us to capture the essence of Amelie's imagination. The camera is able to portray to the audience Amelie's hungriness for love and her longing to live in a seemingly perfect world. That is something that all people around the world long to have as their life. Lenny's Grade: ****",8,0,1,4 August 2002

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," PERFECT!!!
","The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a magnificent epic that could not have been made any better even if Steven Spielberg was directing it instead of Peter Jackson. Elijah Wood gives a tour-de-force performance as Mister Frodo in the final film of this series and should receive his very first Oscar nomination. Sean Astin is brilliant as Sam and should also receive an Oscar nomination. The story itself has brought much more depth to its characters giving it a superior strength that makes it unstoppable for 3 hours and 21 minutes. Yet the real brilliance comes in the form of visual effects. Shelob looks absolutely realistic and absolutely brilliant. The Dead Soldiers look amazing in every sense of the word. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields is without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest battle ever put on the big screen, surpassing that of D-Day in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Gollum is absolutely fantastic. The art direction is extraordinarily superb. The cinematography and editing of the picture is nothing short of brilliant. Viggo Mortenson gives a fine performance as does John Noble as Denethor, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, and Bernard Hill as King Theoden. Hugo Weaving (Elrond) is just as good as he was in Fellowship. Miranda Otto is nothing short of fantastic and stunning as Eowyn. What more can I say except that every aspect of this movie is brilliant and it will go down as one of the great movie classics. It shall win the Oscar for Best Picture without any competition from Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain. Accolades to Peter Jackson for taking a literary masterpiece so grand in scale and turning it into a film masterpiece so grand in scale. He should and will win the Oscar for Best Director. The Lord of the Rings shall forever be a classic movie trilogy and will go down as one of the greatest stories ever told not just in the cinema but also in the world as well.

The Godfather," The greatest mob film ever
","The Godfather is one of the best films of all time. Marlon Brando gives a powerful performance as Don Corleone along with Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Cann, and Talia Shire. It shows the brutal strength of the mob and how they controlled things back in the day. It is truly an American classic and is hardly considered a dissappointment to many fans. The winner of 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1972 and Best Actor, The Godfather is indeed a film that any movie fanatic should see because it contains a brilliant script, powerful acting, and wonderful direction. One of my favorite lines from this film is 'I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse' spoken by Don Corleone, signifying the power of the mob and what it can do to get what it wants. Marlon Brando's performance was so superb that he won an Oscar for it. I loved this movie! If you are any movie fanatic, you should see this movie before any other.",10,2,5,14 May 2002
