Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Gets worse on repeat viewings
","The only reason it gets a two is because the technical work that was involved with CG, video effects, sound effects, etc. was fairly decent at the time of the movie's production.The plot, dialogue, direction, etc. of the movie is just plain awful. Even as a Stars Wars fan, I cannot defend this movie. It is truly horrendous. There's nothing positive about the experience of having to watch this film other than to gather potential leads towards the story line in future movies. On its own, however, this movie isn't lackluster, it's substanceless. I definitely have seen better home made movies by teenagers than this trash. If you don't need to see it, read the Wikipedia article explaining the plot. It will be worth more than seeing it. Watch one of the other Star Wars movies instead while you read the Wikipedia article on this movie, or just watch most any other sci-fi movie. Don't bother with this.",2,1,2,8 December 2017
Alexander," Very difficult to find value
","There aren't many attributes which are worth analyzing in this movie. The script is terrible. 'you break my heart, you men, afraid' wow. compelling. There are segments where bickering breaks out, yet there is no repartee, just people yelling -- oh, and swelling music.fact there are so many voice overs throughout the movie clearly indicate there are some serious problems with storytelling. As far as I can tell, there is no continuity. Not with the scenes or dialog or emotions they attempt to portray.The thinly veiled sexual confusion present in the characters is embarrassing.The wigs are fantastically terrible, and so very confusing for ancient Greece. The accents are strange and variable. There is no feeling that it is even attempting to portray the any sense of the period, except for the presence of Greek mythology in some of the dialog. The movie isn't quite epic, though it probably cost as much as an epic film. Even though it is lacking in historical value and reference, I thought it could have been fun as an epic. Alas no.I had heard it was bad, but I was willing to give it a chance. I feel I can marshall preconceptions to some extent, but this film was impossible to see any other way.",2,5,8,4 November 2007
Ready Player One," Fair representation of the book - kinda fun - terrible soundtrack (not the 80s part)
","Detail-wise, it's not the book. It doesn't matter though as it does cover much of the general themes, settings, allusions, etc. Decent job by Spielberg by reinterpreting the book.
That being said, it doesn't really have much to go on. It's fun enough, but somewhat confusing, relying on special effects to handle the inconsistencies in the lack of continuity and abrupt changes in the character relationships unexplained by the script.
Still - it's ok, but nothing great.
The soundtrack, although Alan Silvestri instead of John Williams, is really the most saccharine John Williams it could be. The 80s reference music are totally in line with the book, but that soundtrack other than those notes, is completely distracting, melodramatic and annoying.
Anyhow - a solid 5 overall.",5,0,1,5 August 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Still wonderfully relevant
","In 1965, My Fair Lady won the big awards, but this film will more than likely outlast that film given its wonderful performances by Peter Sellers and George C Scott. The supporting cast is brilliant and the imagery of the filmmaker will leave indelible images in the minds of movie goers for all time. There are great quotes, seemingly contrived situations and wonderful characterizations which are uncomfortably still pertinent to people in power today. In many ways this is not a film which matches the cinematic expertise of Kubrik, but it does reveal the excellence in his film-making overall.Thanx, Stanley - still great.",10,1,2,22 December 2007
Barry Lyndon," Beautiful Cinematography, Tough Sell Otherwise
","The story of the NASA lenses and their use in the candlelight scenes should be enough for anyone who cares about the presentation of clever cinematography to watch this film. There are countless scenes of beauty in this film and Kubrick takes great care in presenting them in a consistent and lovely way. The biggest problem with the movie is everything else. The writing and acting seems stale at many points during the film resulting in a film which is quite a chore to review even given the luscious scenery that the cinematography gives us. If you care about the visual qualities of immersion that movie making can give you, then watch this film. If you are interested in period pieces of the 18th century, watch this film. Beyond that, it's your choice whether you wish to struggle through this epic.",6,3,7,22 December 2007
Enchanted," Great Film
","I love many dark and difficult films... Movies about war... Many good reader movies... Movies about philosophy...Movies that force you to think about the struggle of mankind... But in my heart, I'm still an optimist, and the manner in which this film is able to bring that heart out is quite effective. I can't help just cackling WITH the excellent performance of Amy Adams. It moves me to tears each time in the best way. Maybe I watched too many cartoons as a child, but then again, I probably analyzed them, and the irony and satire present in this film is successful in joining those memories with reality. Quite delicious.",9,2,2,5 September 2008
Dog Day Afternoon," Clearly a high point in Pacino's career
","There have been many films before and after this film that permitted Pacino to present his acting talent, but this is definitely a classic. Great writing & direction provide a wonderful setting for Pacino to deliver an excellent performance worth of the accolades which he has deserved for years. There are moments in the film's dialog which seem dated today, but nonetheless, the intensity of the performance is present in the staged setting portrayed in this high quality film. There are great supporting efforts by many actors, but the energy of the film is driven by the performance given by and cinematic focus upon Al Pacino. Listen, view and enjoy this film which showcases both Al & Sidney's talents.",8,1,2,22 December 2007
Up," Pixar living off of their previous successes
","The first 15 minutes of the film are beautiful and perfect. The heart and soul of those minutes are completely in line with the excellence that Pixar has been able to produce through their many films. I would recommend anyone seeing those minutes as they are so appropo for any human film-goer to understand and enjoy.Then there's the rest of the film. So lackluster. The characters are feeble. The story is nice and well-told, but relatively boring. If I had never seen other Pixar films, perhaps I would think this film would be an achievement, as opposed to something derivative and unimaginative. When reviewing that portion of the film, it's somewhat hard to remember individual instances that take place. This aspect is completely unlike other Pixar films, or for that matter, other animated films in recent years. The story is just not interesting. The characters are not interesting. The dialogue, the same. What in the story is compelling? Not much. There's no real story envelope of excitement. It's flat and somewhat dull, which for me, as a Pixar fan, is a great disappointment. Watch the film, but treat it fairly.",5,2,5,7 March 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Incorrect not to see it if you review films
","Like it or notIt is a strong, well made film representing a wondrous work of fiction with at least some relevance to that work.However, the film making is beautiful, striking, horrible. The contact with the characters is wonderful no matter how much you might hate them.This is what film making is about. Bringing the audience into a setting, a set of characters, a plot.Decide for yourself.Did you feel cheated?",10,1,3,16 November 2012
