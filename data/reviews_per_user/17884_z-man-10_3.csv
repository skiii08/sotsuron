The Blair Witch Project," a Gen-X, vidcap version of Hansel & Gretel
","It was excessively hyped, but otherwise this movie gives the finger to all those slick, bloated, vacuous Hollywood products.   The best special effects remain the imagination of the audience and convincing actors.   The 3 young actors in Blair Witch are a contrast to  an overgrown Barbie Doll likeJennifer Love Hewitt and a nincompoop like David Arquette (who in the TV prequel to Lonesome Dove played young Robert Duvall more like young Sonny Bono).  The only thing I disliked strongly about Blair Witch was  its Puritanical view of the forest as a place of witchcraft and evil.",Null,0,0,30 November 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," a classic
","i watched this movie again after about 15 years and I'm still amazed how much I enjoy it.   Peter Sellers and George C Scott were at the height of their considerable powers and Kubrick got an excellent performance out of a limited actor like Sterling Hayden.  This is the best of satire and an excellent movie; what baffles me is the dearth of comments on it in this forum;  'PulpFiction' and even 'starship Troopers' each have in excess of 200 comments, which to me indicates the # comments on a film on the IMDB is in direct proportion to quality.",Null,0,0,30 November 1999
Pulp Fiction," no, it's trash
","The cool guy attitudes and casual violence appeal to people who had an arrested adolescence.  Tarantino is the king of geeks, which is probably why Roger Ebert kisses up to him so gratuitously.  This is an awful flashy purely superficial movie that's made for jerks with attention deficit disorder.",Null,0,2,28 November 1999
