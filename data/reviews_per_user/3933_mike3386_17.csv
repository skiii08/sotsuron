The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A Mockingjay Too Far
","I hesitate to add my underwhelming review to the rapidly growing list of IMDb User Reviews that are saying what this movie is - money grubbing at the box office with a franchise that already had a somewhat difficult premise to accept - youngsters fighting to the death. But this time the marketeers really did get the job done - Mockingjay - Part 1 - they have undoubtedly killed this series right there, Part 1 of 1.It's difficult to find anything good to say, and the other IMDb Reviewers are already laying bare the faults: The movie just drags and drags, the plot is so thin and trite there really isn't any, if you've seen the TV previews you've already seen the only real action sequence, and the dialog is just awful. Long, lingering shots of the admittedly handsome young guys in the movie might appeal to 14-year old girls, but the rest of our audience - mostly Seniors - was seriously nodding off, even SNORING, way before this mess reached its agonizingly long run time of two hours and three minutes.Interesting actors/characters - with the exception of saying goodbye to Philip Seymour Hoffman - are almost totally missing. President Snow (Donald Sutherland), arguably one of the more interesting characters, is almost absent, and Caesar Flickerman's (Stanley Tucci) appearances are little more than cameos. Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) without makeup and the character's goofy outfits/hairdos is hardly recognizable, and Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) is left with so few memorable lines that none of us would have blamed him if he really had been drunk.In summation, if you want to see Hollywood at its uninspired worst, this movie will git er done . . . if 'Noah' didn't already.",2,24,38,22 November 2014
The Monuments Men," Incredibly Disappointing
","OK I bought all the early hype, I'm a sucker, I like movies, and I never learn. Sue me. But you know what? When you see a whole troop of actors making the TV circuit for a couple weeks when their movie opens, be careful. Truly good movies do not need much hype, and this is truly not a good movie. My numerical rating on IMDb is a '6' and I'm being kind; it could be and is being rated much lower by 'real' moviegoers. I'm biased, I like George Clooney, I'm from the Cincinnati area, so he's a legend around here . . . and the very crowded 3:30 p.m. showing confirmed it. This movie is not as bad as his horrible 'The Men Who Stare at Goats' but no where near his fine 'Michael Clayton' . . . and if you're looking for humor anywhere near his hilarious 'Oh Brother, Where Art Thou', you'll be sorely disappointed. I won't spoil any of the plot for you if you wanna go see this movie because there isn't much plot to spoil, it really needed some good screenplay writing. The dialog is flat and plodding, the actors are just walking around in various locations, you cannot relate to any of them or what they are doing, the plot is as disjointed as the scenes, and if you nod off during the terribly slow and dark beginning, you'll be easily forgiven. But George is handsome, Cate is beautiful and the camera focus is good, so enjoy your popcorn, it'll be the highlight.",6,16,27,9 February 2014
Darkest Hour," Churchill, Mumbling Savior of World Order
","Oscar season brings out the good stuff, but this 2+ hour soliloquy, by arguably one of the most momentous figures in the 20th Century, will leave even ardent history buffs gasping for one action scene, one cutaway from makeup, cigars, and prosthetics, no matter how effectively applied. This movie will serve a niche audience, a very special type of moviegoer who already knows and loves Winston Churchill; in fact, those relatively new to Churchill might come away thinking him a mumbling drinker, a joke cracking W.C. Fields, unsure of his place in the English government and timid regarding his approaching role in world history. It would be an understatement to say this movie starts slowly, and at its best falls way short of anything remotely riveting. Combining the best of this plodding, myopic movie with the superficial 'Dunkirk' (2017) might produce one watchable - and slightly believable - look back at World War II. Political junkies will take solace in the endless backroom machinations of Parliament, leaving the rest of us to enjoy the handkerchief waving chamber room antics. For the more discerning movie fan, it will be a leap of faith to imagine Churchill phoning Roosevelt for armaments while in the restroom, or conducting war strategy from a basement not wholly unlike 'Wayne's World'. Oldman's Churchill looks like Churchill, even walks like Churchill, but perish the thought, he did not sound like Churchill. Most noticeable was the missing cadence of those wonderful words of Churchill, delivered in a now-slow, hesitating, even plodding at times, pace. While the oration style clung unerringly to the 'Darkest Hour' title, just once I wanted to hear Oldman break into that famous full-throated drumbeat pace of, 'Let us therefore brace ourselves for our duties, and so bear ourselves that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.' 'Wait for the DVD . . . or just watch clips at this year's Academy Awards Ceremony, where Oldman's Churchill will be on parade.",6,28,55,7 January 2018
The Hateful Eight," Murder on the Stagecoach Line
","For a die hard Western devotee it is difficult to find fault with any movie keeping the genre alive, if even on the periphery . . . and this movie is unusual, Tarantino virtually guarantees an off-center approach, not bad per se for a Western, but certainly different. In some ways this presentation had the feel of 'Murder on the Orient Express', 'Stagecoach', and a (frigid) 'Once Upon a Time in the West'.If you like lengthy dialogue, this movie will thrill you, e.g., it exceeds 3 hours, with 95% of it set in a one-room stagecoach layover. I haven't heard so many BS stories since high school pool hall trips in the 1960s. There are glimpses of the beautiful Colorado-meant-to-be-Wyoming snow-covered mountains, but only to ensure that the viewer knows the location is completely isolated. Albeit worse than ruggedly nasty, the warm interior with glowing fireplace and meandering conversations made me sleepy, and I literally dozed off for who knows how long . . . embarrassing for a movie fan to even admit.So? What's wrong with this Western touting some comedy with its gore? It is virtually impossible for the viewer to transport himself/herself into the movie, something Westerns have always been able to do. Whether as the hero, villain, or innocent subject, Westerns tug at us, beckon us. Not this time. With the possible exception of wanting to wear Samuel L. Jackson's hat, the characters are repulsive, even the handsome Kurt Russell.So? After all the talking, and the posturing, and the mystery, was it worth the wait? Not really, a pure Tarantino finish. So just enjoy the 'ride' . . . uh, saunter, and wait for the remastered version of Roy Orbison's beautiful 1967 song, 'There Won't Be Many Coming Home' to play as the closing credits roll.",8,1,16,2 January 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A Movie Worthy of the Coen Brothers
","Well, it must be Oscar season . . . Hollywood is rolling out the good stuff, e.g., 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' (2017), is a no-brainer go-to for me if for no other reason than Sam Rockwell is in it, 'The Green Mile' (1999), 'The Way Way Back' (2013). Stir in several other fine cast members, no less than Frances McDormand, 'Fargo' (1996), and Woody Harrelson, 'No Country for Old Men, (2007), simmer with an awesome script, cover with an interesting story and serve with ongoing dialog so funny in places that you'll wet your pants, then suddenly so sobering that you hold your breath over these Thanksgiving leftovers. This movie defines 'dark comedy', cover your eyes and watch through your fingers dark.The movie runs just short of two hours, and I wanted to watch another hour; nor was I ready for the way it ended. This is truly an actors' hayride that takes the audience along for the ups, downs, turns and spills; watch what a fine cast can do with a good script. As the story unfolds, the characters are not quite what they seem, sometimes this is refreshing, other times disturbing . . . either way, always interesting.Very few things pull this movie down, but the sound mix occasionally leaves the audience wondering what was said, jarringly sensual, maybe even unnecessary language cements the 'R' rating, and the plot, however intriguing, has gaping logic holes in a few places.",7,2,4,27 November 2017
American Sniper," Strong Performance by Bradley Cooper
","Many of us met Bradley Cooper on screen as a heavy drinking goof ball in the first of the 'Hangover' movies. Sure we liked him even then, the flashy grin, the penetrating eyes, but the role was fluff stuff. Not this time. In about five years he now turns in a riveting performance, much in the pattern of what DiCaprio did in 'Blood Diamond', actors coming of age in American cinema.Of course Eastwood can direct, did anyone seriously doubt it? Gun play of any kind? Heck he virtually cut his teeth on guns. This time the war setting is all too real and the suspense seemed to fill a nearly sold out theater at the 7:00 p.m. Thursday showing.What's not to like? A few of the scenes here in the States, did anyone edit this stuff? As other reviewers have mentioned, a fake baby? Silly. Couldn't anyone find a real baby? Some of the goofs are distracting, e.g., in one scene Cooper has a goatee, in the next scene no later than a day or two, he has a full beard.In the final analysis a gut wrenching true story about a brave American who laid it all on the line over and over again so that the rest of us can sleep at night. As Chris says in one scene, 'Do we want to stop them here, in San Diego, in New York?' And in some poignant acting, we get a glimpse of the mental anguish his wife lived through in the process.",8,12,31,15 January 2015
American Hustle," Hollywood Hype
","Should have read more reviews before wasting my $$$ and time. Admittedly, all the pre-release hoopla conned me.Boring, little to no action, dialogue so long-winded my ears hurt (Bale can do that), and a plot that seems the result of 'improv acting', i.e., anyone with lines just delivers them.Despite already being overly-long, the audience keeps waiting for something to happen . . . it doesn't . . . if that's a 'spoiler', consider yourself very lucky, i.e., you've been warned by a 68-year old lifelong movie buff.What a waste of good actors.",3,53,101,23 December 2013
Oblivion," What's Not To Like?
","Do you like science fiction? Check. Do you like plausible science fiction? Check. Do you like whiz bang special effects? Check. Do you like a good story? Check. Do you like a mystery? Check. Do you like good acting? Check. Do you like gorgeous photography and good dialog? Check. Do you like to escape into a story, into a character? Check, check. So what's not to like? Very little.This is a fine movie that will grab your attention and hold it to the point that you'll not want to look away. Whether you're watching it for the first time or the fifth time, there is so much to enjoy, to savor, to experience . . .Many scenes are visually stunning; the 'how did they do that factor' is forever surfacing. The story is complicated but touching, and the plot twists are unexpected to say the least. Tom Cruise, as always, gives his best effort. The ending? You gotta see it, feel it, be surprised by it. All will be made clear.Don't be dissuaded by the negative reviews, don't be persuaded by the positive reviews, make up your own mind. It's running regularly on cable right now, so all you're out is the time investment . . . tell me again how much you paid at the theater for the third instalment of 'The Hunger Games'.Be careful. This movie, without all the hoopla and actors parading the talk circuit, will sneak up on you. Enjoy.",8,0,0,24 November 2014
The Revenant," The Sound of Snow
","I expected more. This movie tries, it really does, but in 2 hours and 36 minutes I began to long for the sound of the human voice, much like 'Cast Away' (2000), not to mention that even mountain beauty begins to look like just so much more snow after awhile, especially when filmed in constant dreariness.The actual, fact-based premise is virtually unbelievable; nevertheless, the director heaped on even more, e.g., from single-shot pistols firing more than once to 50 Indians unable to bring down one severely crippled man at 25 feet.Little things begin to grate after a couple hours, e.g., long close-ups of Leo's snot-frozen beard, horses that were clearly malnourished, and grime and filth so constant that I wanted to take a shower. Character development is nonexistent, with only Captain Henry piquing our interest anyway. Jim Bridger, one of America's most famous mountain men, comes across mostly as a sniveling teenage murder accomplice.In the final analysis perhaps I'm hardest on films I love the most, i.e., the Western genre, to which this qualifies, but instead of a lasting memorial chronicle of the West like 'Dances With Wolves' (1990), we're left with yet another grimy, gory, outdoor thriller with a bear.",7,1,4,8 January 2016
Dunkirk," Nonsensical vs. Nonlinear
","Christopher Nolan's directorial style is described as nonlinear. The historical significance of this well-known World War II event apparently caused Nolan to make a movie with no discernible plot whatsoever, no story, no character development.This mess is capped off with the worst sound I've heard in a movie in the last 10 years. I will acknowledge that I'm an aging movie fan; however, when no more than 25% of a movie's dialog is understandable – even at a modern theater – something is terribly wrong. The spoken words, most already with thick British accents, are virtually drowned out by a grindingly loud score, gun and cannon fire, explosions, and the sounds of war machines. Tom Hardy has a garbled delivery on his best acting day; with an oxygen mask and a wailing British Spitfire ever-present, the viewer is left to guess what he might be saying . . . AND HIS DIALOG IS SOME OF THE MOST UNDERSTANDABLE IN THE MOVIE!Some of the plot, where there is any, is silly (it pains me to even use that word in conjunction with a discussion of such a momentous event in history). When fleeing soldiers discuss throwing one hapless Frenchman overboard to save a sinking – and relatively large – fishing trawler, I felt that I'd wandered into a teen flick. Frankly, some of the 'hero' characters are simply unlikable, the two fleeing soldiers in particular.Surely there was some saving grace, right? No, and don't for a minute compare this travesty to such fine war movies as 'Saving Private Ryan', 'The Pianist', or 'Schindler's List'. The horrible sound and missing plot are accompanied by flat, washed out color (no doubt begging for Oscar attention), frequently fuzzy focusing probably meaning something to egghead critics, flat and shallow acting without discernible emotion – even when a young boy is accidentally and tragically killed, and scenes that are SUPPOSED to fit together but do not, e.g., darkness in one, daylight in another, back and forth, ad nauseam. Good reviews? Yep, tons of them, many by dutiful Nolan fans stepping up to point out that the rest of us are stupid, unable to understand movie art. Movies with lots of pre-release hype and critical acclaim make me nervous, but hey, it's a war movie, how bad can it be? Ans. Very bad.",3,12,26,23 July 2017
No Country for Old Men," The Very Definition of Movie Making
","I try to reserve a '10' vote for the best of the best, the classics, movies impossible to forget, scenes that play over and over in the mind. By way of preface, it is acknowledged that the good and bad ratings for this movie fall generally into two camps, i.e., men love it, women hate it. Women search for meaning in everything, a message, a story, an outcome that 'says something', and for that and many similar reasons this movie disappoints them. Why? Because this movie just 'is' . . . it is there, you can't explain it any more than Sheriff Bell can explain the violence he sees in Texas . . . the real violence we see all around us every day.There are so many riveting scenes in 'No Country for Old Men' it's impossible to pick one favorite. The breath-taking violence in the movie is eclipsed by the fine acting by every single actor in the movie. It is a well known fact that when Tommy Lee Jones appears in a movie ALL actors step up their performances, and this movie is a perfect example of that. Pick one (you could pick EVERY one) - Stephen Root. An actor perhaps best recognized for his previous goofy portrayal of a total nerd in 'Office Space'. But in this movie, in just a small part, he gives us a character so obviously vile that it oozes out with every word he utters.It's difficult to be objective about a movie that will live on for ages as a classic, a movie that should be used to teach actors how to act. A movie that can entertain me again and again, no matter whether I watch it all or just three minutes. It defines movie making.",10,2,3,9 January 2014
Non-Stop," Very Liam Neeson, and We Love Him For It
","Despite being almost totally set inside an airliner, the plot with many twists and turns, keeps every scene intense and interesting. Air Marshall Bill Marks is the hero we all imagine we would be in times of great group and personal danger. Worse yet, the baddies are bent upon casting Marshall Marks as the real bad guy, perish the thought, we cannot let this happen! For anyone who ever had a moment of flying trepidation to those of us with white knuckles, the movie confirms our worst fears and then some. Guaranteed to keep you guessing to the very end, while you hang desperately to the edge of your seat.Neeson is a worthy heir to the Harrison Ford good guy genre. Maybe it was the real life tragic loss of his beautiful wife, maybe we just see Liam as the underdog refusing to lose. Whatever it is, the magic is working for him right now. A big thumbs up^ for 'Non-Stop' (2014)!",7,1,2,12 March 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Much to Enjoy, Some Slow Spots
","The movie was more than I expected, i.e., it is not just a comedy (like so much of Stiller's stuff), it makes you think, reassess, reflect and reevaluate. It made me wonder if parts of my own life had perhaps been important to someone else even though those same experiences many times seemed humdrum and tedious to me.The photography is outstanding, the scenery breathtaking, and the music stirring. The acting is good or better, the dialogue is entertaining albeit sometimes plodding or even totally missing altogether.Parts of the plot didn't fit too well together, maybe even disjointed (yes, I know it's a farce), and for some unexplained reason the movie was occasionally slow for no real good reason, worse still it happened when there wasn't much else to even look at.Overall a pleasant way to spend two hours.",7,0,3,8 January 2014
Unknown," Very Entertaining & Fast Paced
","Despite being out since early 2011, the movie is not very well known. Difficult to say much about the movie without giving something away, and therein lies the movie's main appeal, i.e., guessing how it will all end.Usual Liam Neeson action bill of fare, which means it's very challenging to follow, with attractive younger women begging to be with him. If you like mystery plots that are not totally unbelievable, you'll love this one.Currently available in Time Warner's $2 movies, a bargain by any standard.",7,2,2,31 December 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," Racey, No, Raunchy Spectacle of Greed and Excess
","An 'X' rating could be justified; but otherwise it is a delightful romp steered expertly by DiCaprio who delivers a character with extremes from hilarious to pitiful. Clearly he is developing into one of Hollywood's most watchable male leads. It kept occurring to me that he had worked hard on this movie, not drifting from one scene to the next. Not only were his lines the stuff of legend, his antics were exhaustive (although some must have been a hoot to film). If on-screen sex - simulated or maybe even real - offends you, there is no way you will be entertained by this movie and its additional display of excessive drug use, lust, greed, and/or the debasing behavior at virtually every minute of this 3-hour movie. All that said, as a red-blooded American male, I loved it all . . . it reminded me of 'Hangover' with a business twist. And DiCaprio has grown from an awkward boy star to revive memories of the likes of Clark Gable, Bogart, and Cary Grant; in fact, he can even summon up comedic antics not seen since Jerry Lewis.",8,1,5,30 December 2013
"Hail, Caesar!"," O Movie, Where Art Thou?
","Clooney has the uncanny ability to become associated with awful movies. 'Hail, Caesar!' is a mess that smacks of five guys plotting over dinner how to make some spending money.Let's tick off what's good, that's easy and quick: Crystal clear photography (a Coen trademark), and interesting sets & costumes. The bad & ugly are endless.The few laughs are strained and forever in coming. The movie is less than two hours but it seems endless with dialogue that just drags, scenes that last forever with no point, and actors who listlessly read their lines - FOR REAL, NOT JUST FOR THE SARCASM. There is no plot, no point, no meaningful conclusion to the stitched together vignettes.Spoof I understand. 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou?' is a spoof, a parody. 'Hail, Caesar!' is a spoof of audiences stupid enough to cough up their money and time.This movie seems to be appealing to a narrow band of reviewers and critics knowledgeable of Hollywood's Golden Age, with some pointing out how stupid the rest of us are for not understanding. That's nice. It doesn't work on any other level.",2,96,174,7 February 2016
Gladiator," A Special Movie Encompassing Much of What is Good About Hollywood
","An epic which goes beyond the spectacle of the Roman empire, to delve so delicately into some of what we've come to believe is good and evil. It is unfortunate that a movie so well grounded in fine acting will probably be remembered more for the inescapable violence.If you enjoy movies as an escape, something you can imagine yourself being transported into, this story, the scenes, will literally swallow you, beckon you to come in to a place and events that you will be sorry to see end. For me, it was the retractable awnings in the Coliseum and the fleeting shots of the hillside villa home of General Maximus, and his beautiful wife and precious son.From the photography to the acting, the rest is Hollywood at its finest. More words are not necessary, let the grandeur of this fine movie sweep you away to an era which we believe was fundamental to civilization on our planet.",10,2,4,3 December 2014
