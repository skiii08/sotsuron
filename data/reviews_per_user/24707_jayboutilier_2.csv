The Blair Witch Project," this crap at it's worst
","I watched this the day me a few friends decided to go camping in the woods. i guess they thought it would scare me. no, honestly it bored me. i have and always will hate documentaries that want to be something that it will never amount to be. Horror movie? no, mock documentary about people with way too much time on their hands... yes OK, i admit, they didn't have much to work with, my suggestion is that if you don't have the money to make it then don't. they could have made something a little bit better, anything but this useless and moronic piece of boredom. it was original which is a plus, but it never goes anywhere with that except weird formations on the ground. don't waste your time on the sequel either, it may have a bigger budget, but it also has a huge cheese factor and the whole 'this movie makes no sense' syndrome. if you want to watch a truly scary movie about camping then i suggest, Wrong Turn. it may not be exactly about camping but it does take place in the woods and it actually is very intense, something this movie lacks.",1,1,3,5 December 2005
Shaun of the Dead," one of the best and funniest zombie movies ever, think coronation street... with zombies
","Shaun is an everyday slob who when we first meet him is having a 'serious discussion' with his girlfriend about their relationship among her two friends and his drunk oaf of a pal. as this film progresses Shaun realizes his downfall with her and must get her back...after the zombies get there of course... what a perfect idea for a horror movie, this is British comedy at it's finest. the beginning of the movie is Shaun's humdrum existence, living with three friends and working at a dead end job. trying to get along with his step dad. Then as his day progresses there are subtle hints that some kind of illness is going around, something deadly indeed. in fact, when Shaun and his pal 'Ed' first see one of the infected, they just think she's drunk and then impale her... and that's when the horror movie begins and yet it's still so funny. this movie will be forever known as the funniest zombie movie ever made (unless of course you prefer dead alive, which i do not) it makes me think of Coronation Street every time i watch it, that is a messed up Halloween edition. i think no one could have pulled off this movie better than the Brits. if Americans had their way with this, Shaun would be an advertising exec, with a model girlfriend and a hunk best pal, who encounter zombies but in a mainstream commercial way, which i think wouldn't work, in fact, i don't Americans could ever top this kind of film in general, but that's another topic. all in all, this movie will rock your boat and then some.",10,1,3,5 December 2005
