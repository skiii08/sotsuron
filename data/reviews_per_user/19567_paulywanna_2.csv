Catch Me If You Can," Fun and entertaining! ***Potential Spoiler***
","Catch Me If You Can is truly an entertaining film.  The 60's style of the adds to the integrity and intrigue of the picture.  The film is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., (Leonardo DiCaprio) a teenager still in high-school who pulls a number stunts and gets away with millions.  With the F.B.I. hot on his tail, it is thrilling to watch over and again how Abagnale is able to escape their reach and play with them as long as he can.  We as the viewers, tend to side with this desperate teenager and enjoy the taste of another sweet victory each time he gets away with a job.  It is interesting to see DiCaprio take on the faces and prestige of doctors, lawyers, and teachers alike.  All in the span of 2 and a half hours.  Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, agent of the F.B.I. and is a superb compliment to DiCaprio.  Hanks always has an aura about him of high regard, and this film is another example of that expectation.  The film was captivating from start to finish and has an ironic ending of which is a superb close to the story.",10,1,2,22 March 2003
Snatch," Worth the art of it all.
","This film doesn't hesitate to get right to the action.  The opening credits alone were a draw for me.  The fast frame, freeze action was masterfully done.  Throughout the film, the viewer is given the eyes of several of the characters, by use of the camera, which was quite enjoyable.  The use of different angles really emphasized the emotion and tasteful action of each scene as well as evoked a sense of interaction with the viewer.  The line between what's reality and what isn't becomes really thin when the viewer becomes engaged as such. One thing, though, the accents were hard to follow, so for me, watching the film was a bit of work, but well worth it in lieu of the art of it.",9,0,1,25 January 2003
