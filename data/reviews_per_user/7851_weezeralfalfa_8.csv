Casablanca," An American in wartime Morocco: pretty good, but too many contrivances
","I've seen this film, in part or whole, a number of times over the years. Used to be I thought it was pretty boring, until the climax at the end. Now that I analyzed it in some depth,I appreciate the whole film more, despite various major contrivances. I'm still not convinced that Humphrey Bogart was the right actor to play the main character: American, Rick. He was good in the climactic sequence, but often rather boring before that. I'm not sure how much was due to the script and how much was due to Bogie's basic personality. I suspect some of both. The plot is divided into 2 parts, both of which are relevant throughout most of the film to the end. There's the question of how Czech resistance fighter Victor Laszio(Paul Henreid) was going to get out of French Morocco, needing a letter of transit to do so. He was considered very dangerous by the Germans. Hence, they sent a patrol, headed by Major Strasser, to Casablanca, where they guessed he would end up, to make sure he didn't leave for a safe haven(the USA). Secondly, the present and future status of the past love affair between Rick and Scandinavian Ilsa(Ingrid Bergman), wife of Laszio, needs to be worked out. Rick and Ilsa had met in Paris, after it was reported that Laszio had been killed by the Germans. When the Germans were about to take over Paris, it was decided they needed to leave France. But, mysteriously, Ilsa didn't show up at the train station where she was supposed to meet Rick. He went south by himself, on to Morocco. Now, she showed up in his café with Laszio. Rick didn't find out until later that they were married before she met Rick, and she only learned that he was alive the day she was supposed to go with Rick. She explained to Rick that she didn't tell him she had been married because it was a secret to help protect her from harm by the Germans. This eased his mind somewhat. This type of love triangle is always difficult to work out, especially if the woman has married her new love: not a factor here. The screenplay keeps the audience guessing which man Ilsa will end up with, whether she makes the choice or it's made for her(it is). I think Ingrid was an excellent choice for Ilsa, having grown up in Scandinavia, her English speech was so European, and she was a lovely and good actress. The occasional close-ups of the faces, especially Ingrid's, helps to define their emotional state.The all important travel document which we are bothered with from the beginning to the very end was an invention of the script writer, having no historical relevance. In the first and last parts of the film, this document is called a letter of transit, whereas in the middle portion, it's called an exit visa. I'm assuming these are the same thing, but it unnecessarily confuses the audience(at least me).We have a fairly interesting group of secondary characters: not too many, and of various nationalities and allegiances relating to the war. Renault(Claude Rains), the French chief of police, says he doesn't have strong feelings about the Vichy vs. free French choice. He will bend with the prevailing wind. Rick similarly claims neutrality. But, like the US, still officially neutral, there are several indications that he's not as neutral as he claims.Clearly, Rick is very depressed about something through most of the film. His café seems to be thriving, so what is it? Partly, the uncertainty of the war, I believe. Also, the void in his romantic life after Ilsa disappeared. He hasn't found an adequate replacement, taking up with a floozy in the meanwhile, and uncertain about what Ilsa wants for the future. When Ilsa pulls a gun on him to hand over the letters of transit he inherited, he remarks 'Go ahead and shoot, you'll be during me a favor'. He's also cynical about the war, and the world in general. When Laszio answers 'If we stop fighting, the world will die', Rick responds. 'What of it. That will put it out of its misery'. With his depression and cynicism dominating his personality, he's a hard man for audiences to like. That's a big problem with this film. But as Renault observes, despite his cynicism and depression, occasionally, he's a sentimentalist. This is shown when he orders the roulette wheel to be 'fixed' so that it comes up the number for a young Bulgarian refugee so that he will have the money to buy a letter of transit, so he and his wife can go to the US. Similarly, in finally providing letters of transit for Laszio and Ilsa, and giving up claim on Ilsa, he demonstrates compassion. 'Casablanca' is not only a love story and wartime drama, it can be considered a musical! Of course, the most remembered song is 'As Time Goes By'. I was surprised to learn this song had been kicking around for a decade before. Of course, its inclusion in this film much increased its visibility. Another prominent song is 'Knock on Wood': the only song specifically composed for this film. Then, there's the famous competition between the Germans, singing a German song, and the much more numerous other patrons of Rick's cafe, drowning them out with 'La Marseillaise'. Many others were played at least a little, mostly by Dooley Wilson, as listed under 'Soundtracks' at this site.",7,0,1,11 March 2017
The Grapes of Wrath," classic narrative of the Depression dispossessed, including Exodus, with somewhat optimistic ending
","Judging from the large number of reviews of this film, compared to most other well regarded films from this era, this must still be regarded as a classic portrayal of the plight of the rural poor during The Great Depression, dispossessed of their rented or sometimes owned land and home, forced to flee to distant overcrowded greener pastures or cities. Actually, this flight had begun around 1920, after the collapse of agriculture produce prices with the ending of WWI. Although only white Americans are depicted, African Americans were leaving southern states, especially, in large numbers during this period and subsequently. Although the Joads understandably didn't see it that way at that time, population dislocations, due to technological progress or resource exhaustion and resource discoveries is an unfortunate integral part of relatively recent history. This film dramatizes the generally greater adverse effect of such dislocations on the elderly, who have often invested near a lifetime in their dispossessed property and lifestyle, thus are more reluctant to abandon the familiar for a distant unknown, and are more likely to die trying to get there under rather primitive traveling conditions, as dramatized in this film. This particular point is more thoroughly emphasized in the subsequent film 'Wild River', in which an elderly woman landowner refuses to leave her lifelong home and plantation, until forced to, even knowing it would soon be drowned by the rising waters behind a new TVA dam. In that case, the woman didn't die of traveling stress. Apparently, she simply willed herself to die, out of depression. She had no desire to start a new life in the TVA-financed alternative property awarded her, in spite of all the immediate and long-term benefits claimed by the TVA rep for the building of that dam.Instead of looking for work in some city, as many did, the Joads hoped to land some temporary labor jobs in the oversaturated farming lands of CA. They are put off by the primitive living conditions, thuggish guards, lack of work, very low pay, and high cost of basic supplies at the several farms owned privately. Later, they discover the more humane living conditions and friendlier attitude at a federal government-sponsored farm. This is, in effect, a plug for the New Deal projects designed, at least partly, to help alleviate much of the poverty and unemployment. The implication is that well off individuals and companies were only interested in exploiting the downtrodden, not in helping them reestablish decent living conditions. As Tom Joad, Henry Fonda, in articulating his parting ambition to act as a superman, helping the downtrodden, is really articulating some of the general goals of the New Deal and the liberal political agenda. He himself, as an accused murderer on the run and parolee, isn't likely to achieve much of what he claims he wants to do. But well-healed responsive governments could help the downtrodden in their fights against exploiting capitalists. That is the main message. Of course, in reality, this is an oversimplification. By developing new technologies and discovering new resources, private individuals and companies potentially gradually improve the living standards of their workers and consumers, with a degree of competition generally a positive influence.A few years before, Fonda had starred in 'You Only Live Once', in which his character is paroled from a prison term for some youthful robberies, with the help of his acquired girlfriend. But, potential employers are put off by his status as a parolee, hence he can't keep a decent job, then is soon judged guilty of a large bank robbery he had nothing to do with.. Later, he accidentally kills a man during a prison break just before his scheduled execution, engineered by his girlfriend. They are later gunned down in an ambush near the Canadian border. Rather reminiscent of the historical Bonnie and Clyde, of the times. In all, a pessimistic comment on the refusal of society to ignore the past transgressions of people, especially poor people, in giving them a real opportunity to make amends. This film was made during the depths of the depression, whereas the present film, with its more optimistic ending, was made as the US was beginning to pull out of the depression, with the beginnings of producing materials relating to WWII.Jane Darwell, who plays Ma Joad, played an important role in the prior 'Ramona', which also included Russel Simpson(Pa Joad), and John Carridine(Casy, in the present film). The plot of this film has some strong resemblances to that of the present film. but, the victims of forced evacuation of their homes and fields are Christianized California Indians, soon after CA had been wrested by the US from Mexico. Like the Joads, they packed up their minimal belongings and traveled to some unknown destination. Unlike the other, hostile, Americans, Jane's character was friendly and accommodating to these Christianized Indians. Near the end, she gives a lengthy encouraging speech, with a gist similar to her optimistic speech at the end of the present film. Thus, Jane's character is presented as sort of equivalent to the federally-sponsored farm in the present film. In contrast to the present film, 'Ramona' was filmed in 3-strip Technicolor. B&W was probably a better choice for the present film. Another relevant film: 'Sullivan's Travels'('41) explores the largely urban dispossessed during The Depression, and their prejudicial treatment by the legal and penal systems.....Of course, Ford soon followed the present film with the plight-of the-mining community tear jerker 'How Green Was My Valley'. Ford liked to champion the underdog, and the discriminated minorities, of which he, as an Irish Catholic, was one.",10,0,1,6 October 2014
Duck Soup," Ducky farce about 2 neighboring small countries
","For non-stop chaos and hilarity, this Marx Brothers film is hard to beat. Frequently, the screenplay makes little sense, as expected in a Marx comedy. Groucho is especially prominent, doing a little singing and dancing to complement his usual insulting remarks and puns and flirtations. Margaret Dumont has an unusual amount of screen time, this being one of 7 of their films she was in, usually playing a wealthy widow society matron whom Groucho alternatively insults and flirts with. Here, she even gets to demonstrate her opera-trained singing voice. She plays the chief financier of the small country of Fredonia. Thus, she gets to name the new prime minister in the form of Groucho(Firefly), who takes full advantage of his position to do his usual stick. Chico and Harpo also contribute their brands of zaniness, sometimes together, sometimes separately, sometimes with Groucho. In a particularly memorable segment, Chico or Harpo or both are street vendors, selling peanuts. They have a hilarious time fighting with Edgar Kennedy, as the lemonade vendor next door. Sometimes the pair are working for Groucho; sometimes they are employed as spies for the neighboring country of Sylvania. Harpo is Groucho's trickster motorcycle driver. Chico is sometimes Groucho's war minister. Louis Calhern plays the scheming ambassador for Sylvania: the defacto villain. There is the memorable mirror mimicry scene, which provides perhaps 5 min. of silence, while Groucho and Harpo mimic each other's movements on either side of an empty mirror frame, Harpo being made up like Groucho. Chico then arrives, also made up like Groucho. The basic idea had been done in film a few times before, and would be done by others in the future. I'm personally familiar with instances by Bob Hope, Don O'Connor, and even Errol Flynn.In the music department, early on, Zeppo and Margaret Dumont sing 'His Excellency is Due', then Groucho and Margaret sing 'These are the Laws of my Administration'. Later, the brothers sing 'The Country is Going to War'. All these were composed by the team of Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar, who were honored in the 1950 film 'Three Little Words'. This was the last film the brothers did for Paramount, as well as being tied with 'Horse Feathers' for the shorted length, at only 68 min.. One of the obvious differences in the structure of the coming MGM films with the Paramount films, is the inclusion of a young romantic couple, who do some of the singing. and usually have some problem interfering with their ability to get married, which the brothers help to solve. Zeppo would also be totally absent from future films. His presence in the Paramount films, including this one, was always tenuous, anyway.",10,0,0,25 December 2016
Gone with the Wind," A coming of age story, among other things
","Although not usually described as such, among other things, book author Margaret Mitchell(MM) meant this to be a coming of age story for Scarlett, who ages from 16 to 28 in the book. It doesn't seem quite that long in the movie. Scarlett is partly based on MM herself. Like Scarlet, she was a society debutant, often with a flock of beaus simultaneously. According to the book, and somewhat exemplified in the movie, Scarlett has little taste for sex, finding it often painful and embarrassing, and sometimes leading to the more painful process of birth. She decides that she doesn't want any more babies after the first, because her waist expanded after her first birthing. Thus, lovers find it frustrating that this beauty is so frigid. .....Another overpowering theme of the book and movie is the differences in skill and luck in surviving adversity. Both Rhett and Ashley are survivals of the war, whereas most of their neighbors and relatives are not. Scarlett and Melanie are also survivors, sometimes using men to get their post-war businesses on their feet. In some ways, Scarlett is a feminist. She has good native intelligence, is manipulative, becomes a good manager of her plantation, and her new lumber business. She has learned that she can get along without a man. However, I'm puzzled by her parting question, as Rhett leaves for good: 'Where will I go? What will I do'? She still had her plantation, which seemed to be operating at a profit. She had managed before without a man. She probably would like to have another child, or perhaps take in several of the many orphans or widows left from the war, since she's worried about the effect of pregnancy on her figure. Since Ashley is now a widower, she might finagle him into a largely sexless marriage?........It's not real apparent to me why Rhett is wealthy. Perhaps from his blockade running? Also, apparently, he became a scalawag after the war, which may have brought in some income........Neither Gable nor Leslie Howard(Ashley) wanted to be in this movie. For one thing, Gable dismissed it as 'a woman's movie'. Howard thought he was far too old(46) to be playing a supposedly 21 y.o. when Scarlett was 16. However, the casting director felt he had the best personality and physique to play the effete Ashley. In contrast, there was much competition for the roles of Scarlet and Melanie. George Cukor: the beginning director, was famous as a woman's director, in contrast to his replacement: Victor Fleming. Thus, after he was canned, Cukor still coached Vivien Leigh (Scarlett) and Olivia DeHavilland (Melanie) on weekends!.......It's strange that Melanie died soon after collapsing(swooning?), just after she exited Rhett's room, where he was mourning the death of his daughter. Suggests she had some underlying health problem, that was enhanced by psychological stress........This was but one of several tragedies late in the film. Of course, the accidental death of Rhett's and Scarlett's little girl was a shock. Rhett seemed more disturbed than Scarlett, apparently feeling that his marriage was jinxed, which accelerated his determination to opt out of the marriage......Then, there was a the pervasive tragedy of Scarlett's unreciprocated love of Ashley, and the fact that she didn't really warm up to Rhett consistently until it was too late.......Of course, the cinematography, production values, sets, costumes, and acting are all topnotch, not to mention the very memorable theme song.",9,1,2,19 July 2018
Singin' in the Rain," a review of how this film fits into the careers of the stars.
","You don't need a 500+ person to tell you that this film is a classic in terms of the abundance and quality of the music, dancing and comedy, So, I'd like to fill my space with insights into the stars' overall relations and how certain key performances relate to their previous and subsequent films.It's the only film that paired two of the greatest male musical comedy entertainers of that era: Gene Kelly and Don O'Connor. We might wonder why they weren't paired again? Although Gene was a well established MGM star, this was Don's first musical outside his home studio of Universal. He would do another MGM musical the next year: 'I Love Melvin'. Debbie Reynolds again was the romantic lead. Clearly, this film was not given the royal treatment of the present film and is much shorter. But, it gives us an opportunity to see what Don and Debbie could do without Gene and Cyd(quite a lot of fun,too!) Reportedly, working with Gene on the present film was rather a traumatic experience for both Don and Debbie, especially the latter. Gene's extreme perfectionism and egoism was legendary. Nonetheless, nearly all his costars, especially Debbie, improved their dancing and acting by working with him. However, neither Don nor Debbie was anxious to do another film with Gene, and neither did.Debbie was actually an anomaly in Gene's '50s musical comedies. In every other of his last 5 Hollywood musicals beginning in '51, his first choice as his leading lady and main female dance partner was Cyd Charisse. Cyd had been kicking around Hollywood for a decade, mostly as a cameo dance specialist. Gene wanted her to costar in 'An American in Paris' the previous year, but a pregnancy ruled that out. Of course, she was a conspicuous dance specialist in the present film. She was his leading lady in the much less commercially successful 'Brigadoon' and 'It's Always Fair Weather', but declined this role in Gene's last Hollywood musical: 'Les Girls', as did 'An American in Paris' costar Leslie Caron. I think they rightly smelled a turkey.I'd like to talk about Don's famous 'Make 'Em Laugh' solo performance, having seen nearly all his Hollywood musicals. Although there are certainly original features to this madcap performance, you might be interested to know that a number of the main features can be recognized in several of his previous Universal films, from '45-'51. Thus, in 'Top Man', Don and Peggy Ryan dance with cloth dummies in one scene. In 'Something in the Wind', he does the bit behind the couch, although without the dummy.In 'Feudin', Fightin'and Fussin'', he does the terminal plunge through a papery wall after dancing. In 'Double Crossbones', we see his jumping up on a wall, followed by a backwards flip. Even the tune was essentially recycled from the 'Be a Clown' Gene Kelly-Judy Garland performance in 'The Pirate'Having also seen nearly all of Gene's Hollywood musical comedies, I'd like to comment on the relation of some of his past and future performances to this film. Back in '44, he costarred in a color film with Rita Hayworth and Phil Silvers, called 'Cover Girl'. Several features of that film have often lead to it being dubbed 'the poor man's 'Singing in the Rain' '. Phil takes the place of Don, as the odd man out in the central romance, but nonetheless an intimate friend of the romantic couple. Rita takes the place of Debbie, being a stage dancer and singer. This threesome do a street dance of joy, sometimes arm in arm, twice, including the parting scene. This somewhat resembles the 'Good Morning' and threesome 'Singing in the Rain' scenes in the present film. Also, Gene does a solo street dance with his shadow, somewhat foreshadowing his 'Singing in the Rain' solo street dance in this film. However, there is a critical mood difference. That 'Alter-Ego' dance was inspired by frustration and apprehension about his future relationship with Rita's character, not by the elation of a new found love, as in the present film.As regards his future films, we see Gene's joyful 'Singing in the Rain' solo as a model for functionally equivalent solos in his next two musicals: 'It's Always Fair Weather' and 'Brigadoon', in the form of the 'I Like Myself' and 'Almost Like Being in Love' dances. I find the former performance, done on roller skates, his most challenging and interesting dance. Don, who didn't do solo dances in this context in his prior Universal musicals, did a functionally similar new love-inspired performance in the first portion of his long 'I Wanna Wander' performance in MGM's 'I Love Melvin', and his classy 'A Man Chases a Girl' dance performance in Fox's 'There's No Business Like Show Business'. His equivalent solo dance in Fox's 'Call Me Madam' was, like Gene's previous dances in 'Cover Girl' and 'On the Town', born out of romantic frustration, but seemed like a dance of enthusiasm, because he got drunk from his frustration! Even MGM's Fred Astaire got in on this trend with his classic new love -inspired ceiling and wall 'You're All the World to Me' dance in 'Royal Wedding', the previous year, and his solo 'Seeing is Believing' levitation dance on a high building in 'The Belle of New York', released the same year as 'Singing in the Rain', and unfortunately overshadowed by it.",10,0,2,21 February 2013
Rio," Very entertaining, colorful, if racist, nerds + birds vs. poachers + vengeful cockatoo.
","Colorful, fun, if predictable, animation film. Has two major themes: the well-trodden 'The Little Engine that Could' theme, as relates to housebound macaw Blu, suddenly forced to prepare to survive in his native jungle, and the theme that wild animals are best left alone in their natural habitat(or perhaps a large aviary), instead of serving as confined companions or trophies for people.The NAACP refuses to sanction TV reruns of the popular '50s 'Amos and Andy' series, because it routinely depicts African Americans as lazy bumbling dimwits, inept crooks, or screaming shrews. Well, they have good reason to object to the characterizations in this film too. The two lead 'good guys' are clearly lily white: one Brazilian, the other from snowy small town MN, USA. They are both very introverted nerds, whose private or professional lives are dominated by their bird friends. They are initially at odds over whether Linda should bring Blu to Rio to mate with Jewel, the only known female of his species, caged by ornithologist Tulio. When this parrot pair is stolen by a gang of poachers and thieves for shipment to other countries, their relationship is further strained, until they decide to work together to recover the parrots. This mission, along with their growing friendship with street urchin Fernando, who stole their parrots for the poacher gang, then regretted his action, serves to cement their positive relationship(Actually, their efforts prove irrelevant to the 2 escapes of the parrots).Meanwhile, Blu is having problems relating to his would-be mate, who has the great advantage of having lived in the jungle until recently. Blu proves a clumsy pessimistic wimp, who has no idea how to favorably impress confident Jewel, despite some coaching by other birds, mainly the street or jungle-wise Pedro and Rafael. Blu continues to complain that he can't fly far, thus has no chance to survive in the wild, where Jewel is determined to return to, if they escape. He doesn't learn that he can fly far until he must, to save himself and Jewel, with a hurt wing, from drowning, after engineering their escape. In reality, pet birds often cannot fly far because their flight feathers have been clipped, as well as the relative lack of wing muscle exercise. The poachers should have clipped their wings(if Tulio hadn't), should they escape.All the poachers clearly are partial or full African Americans, thus reinforcing stereotypes. Except for the boss, Marcel, they are characterized as lazy dimwits, magnitudes dumber than Nigel, Narcel's eagle-like sulphur-crested cockatoo henchman. Nigel is native to Australia, and speaks with a British accent. He joined the poachers because he wants to extract revenge on the colorful Brazilian birds, because one of them replaced him as the star of a Brazilian TV show. Thus, he acts as a Trogan horse, feigning abuse, to be included in Tulio's collection of confiscated, sick, or otherwise collected birds. He overpowers Tulio's night watchman, paving the way for Fernando to steal Blu and Jewel, then continues to play a critical role in the periodic capture of these prizes. His downing of the poacher's plane, by being pulled into the propeller, should have cut him to piece. But we see him later, much ruffled, but alive.The gang of mischievous white-eared marmosets can be taken as a stand in for a street urchin pick pocket gang. The plot actually has a relevant basis. Blu and Jewel have the coloring of Spix's Macaw, which hasn't been seen in the wild since 2000, mostly because of habitat destruction. It's being raised in captive breeding programs, like Tulio planned. Unlike the 'born-free' bias in the film, which no doubt appeals to many identifying audience members, you wouldn't want to release the last breeding pair of a species into the wild, where they are subject to predation and poaching. Blame it on Jewel's misguided refusal to accept confinement.The lead male/female toucan pair, as colored, are actually members of two distinct species. Unlike these animations, real parrots and toucans have 4, not 3, toes: 2 front and 2 back. Pedro is supposed to be a red- crested cardinal, but his color pattern and extreme obesity make him look like a blend of scarlet tanager, pigeon and red cardinal.It's not until the ending credits that we learn that Blu and Jewel have 3 chicks, and that Tulio, Linda, and Fernando appear to have formed a family. In 2012, after this film was released, the animation 'The Pirates' was released. It has a similar theme of rescuing a virtually extinct bird species(Dodo) from the clutches of an evil uncaring person. Unfortunately, the Dodo has no mate to perpetuate the species, and the naturalist(Darwin) ends up still frustrated in finding a woman who will love him. In those respects, it is less satisfying than this film.",9,0,1,8 May 2013
Some Like It Hot," Some like it a lot
","For the most part, I enjoyed this very unusual farce. Casting two men who made themselves up as women in order to escape the wrath of a murderous Chicago gang was a clever plot idea. The incorporation of the historic St. Valentine's Day gangland massacre into the screenplay provides some diversion from the business of trying to continue fooling people into believing that Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are women. Tony and Jack are the principal comedy team. We have 2 other actors: Marilyn Monroe and Joe E. Brown, who are principally strait men for the comedians. The members of 2 gang also serve, to a limited extent, as straight men. The casting was near perfect. Tony and Jack made a great comedy team, and were made up to look like women about as well as possible. The main problems were their manner of walking and their voices, which should have given them away as men. This is a major weakness of the screen play: perhaps fatal if that bothers you too much. Sadly, much of stage and film humor relies on victims who are unusually nonobservant, clumsy or stupid. This reduces the comedic value. Implausible happenings and connections between scenes are frequent in this film. Again, too many of such reduces the comedic value of the film. However, as in this film, this significant negative can often be compensated for by sufficient truly funny happenings. Also, children are no doubt generally less bothered by implausible happenings, judging by the popularity of animations. The scene where various members of the female band gradually squeeze into Jack's(as female)train berth because he has some bootleg liquor reminds me of the famous scene in The Marx Brothers' 'A Night at the Opera', where more and more people have a reason to squeeze into their tiny hotel room, falling and climbing all over each other, until the last one opens the door and half spill out. In addition to masquerading as a woman, Tony masquerades as a rich sea captain, several times going back and forth between one disguise and the other, primarily for the purpose of seducing Marilyn. Clearly, he is trying to imitate Cary Grant's manner of speaking as the captain, reasonably successfully. This somewhat reminds me of a later film starring Tony: 'The Great Imposter', where he successfully masquerades as a number of men in their work.It's clear from a comment by Joe E. Brown that the title means that some people prefer jazz. As usual, Marilyn plays an innocently slutty gold-digger. And, as with so many of her later films, sounds like she was a basket case much of the time, showing up very late or not at all, forgetting her lines, crying and complaining. The director had to put up with these distractions because the public still loved her.",9,0,1,30 January 2017
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Highly energetic, possibly misogynic animation about humanoid mammals running their own circus.
","Superb for those who crave a variety of charismatic humanoid mammalian animations, and long stretches of virtually non-stop supersonic action or slapstick, punctuated by heart to heart dialog. For me as an adult, it gets pretty exhausting and mind-numbingly irrelevant to reality at times. As with most cartoons and animations, it promotes the fantasy that humans and animals can routinely defy the laws of physics and have an infinite number of reincarnations after having been subjected to numerous normally fatal or near fatal bodily insults. Obviously, these are very attractive fantasies for humans, especially children.As in the case of the recent animation 'The Pirates: Band of Misfits', not to mention some classic fairy tales, this film risks being perceived as misogynic, as the constant prime villain is characterized as a woman in authority(In this case, a fanatical, virtually indestructible, French animal control police woman, who shoots anesthetizing darts at them, hoping to add a mounted lion head to her extensive wall collection of animal heads, along with returning the others to their home zoo). Perhaps the idea is that the direct authority figures for most children(mothers, step-mothers, teachers) are primarily women. Hence, the children are identifying with the pirates, scientists, animals or damsel whom the authority figure wants to control or harm. The persecuted humans or animals thus become the heroes in rebelling against the traditional or abusing authority, just as children often wish they could invent their own individual or group activities rather than being directed by robotic authority figures. In this film, the animals eventually are able to own and control their own circus, thus can devise their own amusements for others, as children(and adults) often wish.The other significant intellectual issue is the attitude toward whether it's better for non-domesticated animals to be in their native habitat or confined to a zoo, circus, home or other human-devised enclosure. 'Born-free' fanatics abhor any kind of human-devised confinement and, often, any killing of non-domesticated animals. They forget that nature also is often cruel: that unprotected animals often die of starvation, thirst, poaching, predation or health risks. This point is dramatized to some extent in Madagascar I & II.The ending of the recent animation film 'Rio', with an exhilarating escape of the last two known members of a macaw species into the native jungle, plays on the human emotional bias of wanting to escape physical confinement and the behavioral limits enforced or encouraged by authority figures or, in the case of Blu, by one's own timidness. In reality, assuming that humans had worked out how to promote good reproduction and survival under confined conditions, you wouldn't want to release the last few individuals of a species into the wild, where they and their offspring face many more potential life-threatening challenges, with the possible exception of communicable diseases and parasites. The wise Tulio knows this. But, Jewel, having tasted the freedom of her(much reduced) native forest, and unaware of her own extreme rarity, refuses to accept continued life in confinement, however safe, and has convinced lifelong pet Blu to try to overcome his fears of dealing with the unknown of an unprotected habitat: a good message for children. In the present film, the animals are not characterized as being among the last few of their species. Initially, they decide to try to return to their 'home' in the barred NYC Central Park Zoo, having discovered the downsides to living in their native African habitat. To get there, they jump on a European circus train to escape capture, learn about the circus as a potential fun lifestyle and buy it. They now can have the best of both worlds. As long as they please the customers with their antics(which they initially fail to do), they can have fun, choosing their antics, and not worry about starving or being eaten by predators, nor about being mistreated by human owners. However, first, they have to eliminate than mad French animal control woman, who has followed them to NYC to accomplish her goals. Finally, they subdue her, and she is last seen in a crate bound for Madagascar(which once was a French colony.) Of course, real animals can't own and manage their own circus or zoo. However, as of recent times, they may be lucky enough to escape both the dangers of wild habitats and the boredom and possible mistreatment of confinement in cages, by a more practical alternative: the trend toward open habitat zoos and large aviaries, so that humans can observe them in somewhat natural conditions. That would have been a fitting finale message.Didn't miss that crack about the French and Canadians being ultralazy!",8,0,2,2 January 2014
