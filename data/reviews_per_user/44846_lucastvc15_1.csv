Black Swan," Quite a Mish-Mash
","Take a little bit of 'Carrie' add some 'Showgirls', mix in some 'Basic Instinct', add a dash of 'All about Eve' then you have 'Black Swan'. Don't forget to throw in a lot of black decor in every characters home. This is a laughable film. I like Natalie Portman as an actress but she plays this role so one dimensional. Barbara Hershey has such a tight face and huge teeth ,she almost resembles Mickey Rourke now. I was looking forward to seeing this film. Quite a disappointment. As you watch the film you can almost plot what is going to happen next, based on the films I listed above. Winona rider is Gina Gershon in Showgirls. Barbara Hershey is Piper Laurie in Carrie. The Dancing scene between the two women is straight out of Basic Instinct and so on. Terrible film.",1,25,74,23 December 2010
