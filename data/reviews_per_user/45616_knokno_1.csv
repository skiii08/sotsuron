United 93," Terrible and important event, but ordinary movie
","This is not a great movie, and this is very sad, because these terrible events deserve one. The cinematography is ordinary, looking to much like a movie for television. Sequences are badly assembled, showing suddenly shoes of a guy walking, insists on an earphone, and big shots on a glass of water. So directing seemed pretty bad to me.It is a pretty hollywoodian movie after all, with lot of insistence, lack of subtleties.People are so emotionally involved when watching those events that it seems that they just can't, for now, see the movie as it is, because we can read so much great things about this movie.I believe it will change, after some years.",6,2,5,12 September 2006
