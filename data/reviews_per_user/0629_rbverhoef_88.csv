The Devil's Advocate," A very fine thriller
","'The Devil's Advocate' is one of my favorite thrillers of the nineties. It is not as good as 'The Silence of the Lambs' or 'Seven' but it gives the same pleasure to watch it. What Anthony Hopkins and Kevin Spacey did to those two movies is what Al Pacino does to this. They make great villains and although they do horrible things you admire them in a way. They are the best thing in movies like this.(Minor spoilers.) Al Pacino is the Devil himself here and when someone tells him that the only thing worse than not having a father was having hers, he simply replies: 'I can relate. I can, believe me.' You just have to chuckle when you hear this.Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a hotshot lawyer in Florida who never lost a case. He is approached by a firm from New York to come work for them. John Milton (Al Pacino) is the head of this firm. Kevin's wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) is thrilled with the thought of living in New York at first, but slowly things change. She has creepy visions and she knows things are not as they seem. Kevin's mother, a strong religious person, also feels that things are not good. Around here we learn who Milton really is.The movie has some nice surprises, some of them you might expect, but others are really surprising. What happens I will not reveal, but Pacino's speech near the end, which starts with the words 'let me tell you about God' is great, funny and more than entertaining. The Devil is the perfect role for Pacino, with his charismatic appearance and his false laugh. Reeves is good enough but is almost nothing in comparison with Pacino, the gorgeous Theron does a great job and the very beautiful Connie Nielsen in a role that becomes more important near the movie's end is fine as well.To see this for Pacino is enough, but there is great other stuff here. Don't miss it.",9,1,2,10 November 2003
Saturday Night Fever," Could have been great
","My favorite dance sequence in the movies is Jack Rabbit Slim's Twist Contest from 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the next ten favorites are from 'Grease' and 'Saturday Night Fever'. They all have one thing in common: John Travolta. Where 'Pulp Fiction' was also great without that sequence, 'Grease' and 'Saturday Night Fever' are not. 'Grease' has so much singing and dancing that it is a lot of fun anyway and unfortunately 'Saturday Night Fever' has not. It is not that the rest of the movie is bad. It is all entertaining and pretty good, especially the ending is satisfying, but it could have been great instead of good. Cool guy John Travolta, the disco dancing and the great songs from the Bee Gees together are still a lot of fun.",8,1,2,27 June 2003
Catch Me If You Can," A lot of fun
","While watching 'Catch Me If You Can' I had so much fun I smiled constantly. Well, that smile was interrupted by laughs. The movie tells the story of Frank W. Abignale, Jr. who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher. After his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. The way he does this is funny and brilliant.I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Frank but in this movie he is perfect. He gives a very fine performance. Tom Hanks is the FBI-agent Carl who is after him, and as always Hanks is good.The story is inspired by a real story. I don't know in how many ways it is true but watching this guy all I wanted to see was him pulling more of his nice little tricks. The scene where he pretends to be a schoolteacher is just great. If you want a nice funny movie, not too heavy, this one will definitely please you.",9,197,227,8 June 2003
The Ring," Suspense
","The Ring is a remake of a Japanese movie called Ringu which I haven't seen. I guess that is a good thing because now I don't know what parts were better in Ringu (or not better at all) so I could enjoy this movie totally.Sometimes may be the story goes a little too far but that didn't bother me. It was pretty clever and most of all it was very thrilling and full of suspense. The movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat and Naomi Watts is (as we already could see in Mulholland Dr.) a great actress. She is the perfect heroine in this movie.With good direction, good cinematography, good actors including a great lead actress and music that adds something to the tension Hollywood can make good horror movies.",8,0,1,23 February 2003
Spartacus," A bit too long, but still very good
","Kirk Douglas plays the slave Spartacus. He leads the slave revolt, probably known by many, against Rome in the time just before Julius Ceasar. It is an epic that still looks very good. The battle scene in the end and the scene where Crassus (played by Laurence Olivier) is seducing a slave Antoninus (Tony Curtis) when he is taking a baths are very great. The cinematography is beautiful and although director Stanley Kubrick did not really made the film his own with his wonderful style, he does a great job. Performances by Douglas, Olivier, Curtis, Jean Simmons (who plays Varinia, the wife of Spartacus) and especially Peter Ustinov (as Lentulus Batiatus, who bought Spartacus in the beginning) are amazing. The movie is a little too long but despite that it is a very good one.",9,2,4,29 March 2003
Minority Report," Looks great, interesting story
","May be this film has some flaws but while watching it I wasn't too distracted by that. Here we have one of the greatest directors alive (Steven Spielberg), a very big star (Tom Cruise) with a great ensemble (Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Peter Stormare, Samantha Morton, Tim Blake Nelson) around him, a good cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and a nice score by John Williams all packed in a great story (based on the novel by Philip K. Dick) with perfect visual effects.In the year 2054 murders can be predicted and stopped before they happen. If you were about to kill but stopped you are locked. Tom Cruise is one of the agents who stops those murders. Then he discovers the next murder they have to stop will be committed by himself.I will not reveal more of the plot. The story itself is great. It is intelligent, but also exciting with great action scenes. The visuals are truly beautiful and perfectly support the sci-fi story. If you like action thrillers and you don't mind they are set in the future (with some futuristic gadgets) this is your film. 9/10.",9,106,135,4 February 2003
Finding Neverland," A wonderful movie
","Here is another Johnny Depp performance that makes a movie worth watching no matter what. After 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and 'Secret Window' (that basically only offers the Depp-performance) he once again disappears in his character; this time it is 'Peter Pan'-creator James M. Barrie. Fortunately the movie offers a lot more. The story of Barrie is changed a little. Here the playwright, who just had a terrible release and therefore needs another play, meets the family of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet). She is a widow, left with four children named Peter (Freddie Highmore), George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero) and Michael (Luke Spill). Barrie is able to let his imagination go free, creating his own world together with the children. Especially the little Peter, perfectly played by Highmore, is more an adult than he is. His time with this family results in his famous 'Peter Pan'.Barrie, who is married, of course raises questions. What does a married man do with a widow and what does he want from the children? The way Barrie is shown we assume he really wants to be a child himself, loving the children not in a sexual way, but more as his brothers. In fact, he loves Sylvia but even for her we never get the idea that he loves in the sexual way. The villains, if you can call them that, is Sylvia's mother Emma de Maurier (Julie Christie) and a little cough Sylvia is having. A funny thing in the film is the man who needs Barrie to write a new play, Charles Frohman. He is played by Dustin Hoffman who was Hook in Steven Spielberg's adaptation of the play.The changes made in the story seem to be right for the movie. It is very funny from time to time, and actually moving when it wants to be. Besides the fine performances the movie looks very good too. Art direction, costumes and cinematography all add to the quality of the movie and Jan A.P. Kaczmarek's score fits the events perfectly. It is there, giving a scene strength without us really realizing it. 'Finding Neverland' is one of 2004's best movies.",9,3,3,5 October 2005
Training Day," Great performances
","'Training Day' is one day in the life of officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). It is his first day in training with detective Alonzo (Denzel Washington). Jake also wants to be a detective one day. Alonzo is not your normal detective. At first his intentions are not very clear but when Jake has to do very strange things you know Alonzo is not a good guy.Basically Alonzo and Jake are driving around in a car, sometimes meeting people. That is why the performances are so important. Fortunately they are great. Hawk as the rookie does a very nice job and Washington, not the likable character he often is, creates a great evil character. The movie itself is not that great and the plot has some very predictable points, but because of these two actors the movie is elevated to a higher level.",8,4,19,20 November 2003
Meet the Parents," Painfully funny
","Most of the funny moments in 'Meet the Parents' involve painful scenes with Ben Stiller. He plays Greg Focker, a male nurse who loves Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). He wants to marry her with her father's permission. He hasn't met her parents yet. The movie shows us the weekend where Stiller meets the parents. Pam's father is Jack (Robert De Niro) and her mother is Dina (Blythe Danner). The more Greg tries to impress the parents, especially Jack who is a former CIA-agent, the more he humiliates himself. Not only with his actions, also with his words and stupid lies to look better.Stiller is perfect in this kind of role. We already saw that, especially in 'There's Something About Mary'. The more he gets in trouble, the more painful it gets, the better Stiller gets and the more we laugh. There is also a fine little part from Owen Wilson as Pam's former lover. Stiller and Wilson have made a lot of films together and for some reason their scenes always work, they at least make you smile. De Niro doesn't try very hard to be a strict person who doesn't give Greg a chance and therefore succeeds even better. The way he slowly gets harder and harder on Greg is good for a new laugh every time. 'Meet the Parents', directed by Jay Roach who also directed the 'Austin Powers' trilogy, is a fine comedy with a lot of sequences where you might feel a little uncomfortable.",7,34,52,30 May 2004
Mulan," Another great Disney
","I can't think of a single animated feature film done by Disney that I don't like. For some reason they never bore me and they never feel the same. The classics like 'Snow White' and 'Cinderella' are great but I think I like the newer ones ('The Little Mermaid', 'Beauty and the Beast', 'The Lion King') even more. 'Mulan' definitely belongs to the best ones.Mulan is a girl who doesn't do much right. For the honor of her family she joins the army instead of her father. She takes his gear and runs off. She pretends to be a man and does the training to go to war against the Huns who invaded China.With some nice new songs, great music by Jerry Goldsmith and beautiful animations this is a real Disney. A little dragon called Mushu is helping her on the way. He is send by the ancestors. The voice of Mushu is from Eddie Murphy and he does a very great job. With a quick and good story and a lot of funny moments this is a great movie.",8,55,67,19 May 2003
Monster," Good movie, great performance
","Charlize Theron's performance is better than the movie itself, and the movie is very good. She plays prostitute Aileen Wuornos who killed seven men in the 1980's. Here is a movie that does not try to justify or condemn the things she did, it just shows us how events happened and in the end we are able to understand most things a little better.This approach makes the movie probably better than if it had taken sides. We see and hear how Aileen's life must have been terrible from a very young age. She was abused and abandoned by people close to her. She has been a prostitute since she was thirteen and now she is through with it, but she meets lesbian Selby (Christina Ricci). Whether Aileen is gay or not does not matter, Selby is the first person in a long time who really cares about her and Aileen feels kind of happy for the first time in her life. But then a client beats and rapes her and she snaps and ends up killing him and after this other clients.The movie could turn into a thriller or a real crime movie, but since it has its focus on Aileen and Selby it turns out to be a dramatic movie, with some really disturbing moments. Although Aileen does things we can not approve of you feel sorry for her almost the entire time. It is Theron's performance that makes sure we do this. In every scene we can read her eyes, see how she feels and what she has been through. Theron won the Oscar for her Aileen and it is hard to argue about that. Ricci does a pretty good job as the naive Selby as well, although you should not compare her with Theron. This is a good movie, made even better by a great performance.",8,1,1,11 April 2004
12 Monkeys," A fine sci-fi thriller
","With 'Twelve Monkeys' you need to pay attention, but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate. I know I did. The story is interesting and deals with time traveling. A virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who doesn't believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re-appears in 1996 Kathryn starts believing Cole's stories.The movie constantly plays with time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, it is picked up in the future and 'they' send someone. For Cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call. Things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention. You could ask some questions but since you can't have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie.'Twelve Monkeys' works as sci-fi, with some great images and a dark atmosphere, and it works as a thriller. You are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie. May be it has some flaws in the story, but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling, you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy. That was the easy part for me.",10,44,57,30 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Very, very entertaining
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is one of the most entertaining films I have seen in years. It is not really great, but every single aspect is terrific and that makes sure you don't see its flaws very easily. One of the flaws is the logic, but in a film like this things are not supposed to be logical, so why bother asking that kind of questions.The story, pretty standard with the usual twists, is actually quite good, or at least good enough to keep our attention. I could tell you about it but I think it would sound too silly; it kind of is. We have stories about a curse and a pirate ship called the Black Pearl with its Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), we have a pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), we have a young man named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who loves Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). She loves him too but she is about to marry Norrington (Jack Davenport). Her father is Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce), not the most unimportant person.What curse there is on the Black Pearl you have to see for yourself. Neither am I going to say why the curse is there. Let me just talk about the good stuff. The visual effects are marvelous. Everything looks (and sounds) great. Locations, costumes, makeup. The sword fights and the battles between the English and the pirates are exciting, there is never a moment you are bored.It is not all fighting and visual effects. In the quiet moments we have the most wonderful performance from Johnny Depp. His Jack Sparrow is one of the characters from the movies you are going to remember and the fact that he earned an Oscar nomination for this part says enough. He is so good you almost forget the other actors. Geoffrey Rush comes close to Deppp as the villain Barbossa and actors like Bloom and Knightley play their parts quite well. Unfortunately for them they are always in the shadow of the perfect Depp.There are more good things that make this film entertaining, but I would have to go in detail. I think I have given you enough reasons to see this film (and believe me, Depp alone is reason enough). For a very good time 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black pearl' is as good as it gets.",8,3,8,13 February 2004
Coffee and Cigarettes," Talking over coffee and cigarettes
","'Coffee and Cigarettes' is the project director Jim Jarmusch started back in 1986 with a short film starring Roberto Benigni and Steven Wright. The premise is as simple as it is brilliant. Put some people in a room and let them talk over coffee and cigarettes, most of the time also about coffee and cigarettes. Let some elements return in every single segment you make (there is a toast in every segment) and see where it goes. You film a couple of these episodes in black and white, puts them together and you have a nice film.Of course some segments are better than others. I liked the one with Steve Buscemi ('Twins'), Tom Waits ('Somewhere in California'), Steve Coogan and Alfred Molina ('Cousins?') and Bill Murray ('Delirium') the most. The one with Cate Blanchett ('Cousins') is not the best but since she plays both characters it is quite interesting. I guess every segment has at least one interesting aspect. 'Strange to Meet You', the first one made back in 1986, is interesting since it stars the director and star of 'La Vita è Bella' long before that film made him famous; 'Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil' is interesting because The White Stripes (Meg & Jack White) have the weirdest conversation in a way I believed they really have conversations like this; 'Cousins?' gives us the hardest laughs with the perfect dialog and timing of that dialog; 'Delirium' if fun simply because Bill Murray is in it.What is good about a lot of the segments is that the more famous people are not afraid to portray a weak person, even when they are playing themselves. Iggy Pop has a very hard time with Tom Waits, Cate Blanchet has a very hard time with herself, Alfred Molina is embarrassed by Steve Coogan and even one of Coogan's fans. The film has some minor points. Although it is a real comedy there are no real laughs. There are many smiles, but laughing out loud only happens once or twice. The final moments from most segments could cause the real laughs. Another problem is the fact that you are basically watching a lot of short films. Since you watch them without taking a moment to think about them it is possible you have forgotten the first while the last one is playing. For me it is the same with feature films; after I have seen one I need a moment to think it over before starting the next one.",7,3,6,18 April 2005
The Fifth Element," Entertainment
","There is so much entertainment in this movie it would be almost stupid to write about its flaws. Especially the story is not the best thing here, but who cares. I liked every scene, every moment in this movie. The movie opens in Egypt, 1914, and we meet some strange creatures. From here on we know this is not going to be a normal or very serious sci-fi action movie. The creatures tell a priest that the stones are no longer save on earth and they take some things. They tell the priest they will return in 300 years, when evil arrives.300 years later. The strange creatures return but they are attacked by other strange creatures. The only thing that survives is reconstructed and turns out to be Lee Loo (Milla Jovovich). She is the fifth element, the ultimate weapon against evil. Evil here looks like a great ball of fire. Lee Loo escapes from the authorities, and in an astonishing shot we see how a city looks like now. She jumps of a building and ends up in the flying cab of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis). He saves her from the police, she asks for priest Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), he brings her there.We learn a little more about Lee Loo here. She needs four stones, the four other elements, to save the world. The stones are on a vacation resort where we meet DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker). He has some funny scenes as well. We have also met Zorg, who is played by Gary Oldman in a great way. The attack on the strange creatures early in the movie was planned by him. He wants the stones as well, he is offered a lot of money for them. How the story develops from here I will not reveal.The story doesn't even matter. In every scene we have something to like. Beautiful settings, great visual effects, Gary Oldman, the beautiful Jovovich or the funny moments from Bruce Willis, Chris Tucker and Ian Holm. May be this movie is not for everyone but if you don't think to much you will definitely like it.",8,138,192,2 November 2003
Troy," May be not that good, but very entertaining
","'Troy' is based on Homer's 'The Illiad' but has changed the story from a Greek myth to a Hollywood epic tale. That is not a good thing, but it definitely gives us entertaining results. This Hollywood version shows us the Trojan War a little simplified. The reason of this war between the Greek king Agamemnon (Brian Cox) and the Trojan king Priam (Peter O'Toole) is Helen (Diane Kruger). Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) has taken her from Agamemnon's brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) and Agamemnon sees this as the perfect opportunity to conquer Troy. The Greek have Achilles (Brad Pitt) and the only man Achilles is able to respect, Odysseus (Sean Bean). The Trojans have prince Hector (Eric Bana). Both Achilles and Hector belong to the greatest heroes from the Greek stories.How the story unfolds I will not reveal although the trick with the Trojan Horse is probably familiar with most people. Like I said the movie is not that good, especially on certain levels, and for some that makes sure they will not like the movie. It is true that computer generated armies are not that impressive anymore, it is true that people here talk as they are in a Hollywood romantic comedy, it is true that Brad Pitt, a fine actor, is very miscast as Achilles, it is true that the war doesn't seem to take ten years, it is true that Diane Kruger doesn't make her Helen worth fighting for and it is true that the movie sometimes has its focus on the wrong things.That said, let me focus on the good things. May be the great battles are not that good, although they are entertaining enough, but I have to admit that the inevitable fight between Achilles and Hector is one of the best I have seen. The movie knows that we are not supposed to have a favorite and therefore the sequence is even more exciting. Other action sequences are at least spectacular. There is a fight between Paris and Menelaos who wants his vengeance and the movie makes the right choices in how to shows this sequence.Pitt, Bloom and Kruger are not very good, or at least miscast. True, but Bana and especially Gleeson, Cox and O'Toole are terrific in their roles. O'Toole is mentioned as very positive not for the first time for his performance in 'Troy', his scenes are the best on the emotional level. Most other things are not very good on the emotional level. The cinematography is not bad although it uses the same trick over and over again. The camera starts with a low shot and then it lifts to show how grand and great it all looks. Admittedly, it looks great. Its production design, costumes, visual effects and score from James Horner are close to flawless.Considering all the above you can understand that 'Troy' is a movie with many flaws, some on pretty important levels. I realize that, but if the flaws are not that distracting and the entertainment is as good as in 'Troy' I don't want to complain too much.",7,4,9,30 May 2004
Dead Poets Society," Beautiful and interesting
","'Dead Poets Society' is a beautiful movie from start to finish. The movie tells the story of a new English teacher, Mr. Keating (Robin Williams), who is a lot different than other teachers. He wants the students to think for themselves although other teachers disagree with this vision. They think a boy that is 17 years old is not able to think for himself. You can imagine how the story develops; the students like Mr. Keating, the other teachers don't.Mr. Keating teaches poetry to the students, and inspires some of them to do things they never thought they would do. Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) discovers that his real passion is acting, and Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) learns he can do a lot more than he thought he could. There is also a story line involving a student named Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) who is in love with a girl and because of Mr. Keating he tries to win her over. Of course things can't go right and some tragic events happen. I will not reveal them here. May be they are not very surprising but they do have an impact.Robin Williams as the smart and funny teacher has one of his finest roles here. He is known as a funny guy, but as in 'Good Will Hunting' he finds the perfect way for this part. The students are all very good as well, especially Robert Sean Leonard and Gale Hansen, who plays a guy named Charlie Dalton. The fine direction by Peter Weir completes this very beautiful and interesting movie.",9,0,1,5 November 2003
The Hustler," Wonderful
","Possible minor spoilers.'The Hustler' is a great movie that involves the game of pool. Although this is important it is not really about the game. It is more about the life around it, Fast Eddie Felson's life in particular. Paul Newman plays this man in a terrific way. Eddie is a great pool player, he could be the best, if only he had more character. This is what Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) tells him. It is true. Eddie is a self-destructive man. He drinks too much and he does not know when to stop. At one point early in the movie he is playing the man who is considered the best of the country, Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), and he has won 18.000 dollars but he gets too drunk and loses everything.(Minor spoilers.) Then he meets a girl Sarah (Laurie Piper) who, like him, drinks too much. They start living together and it seems that Eddie is changing, but we suspects he is always thinking about playing Minnesota Fats again. Eddie gets in some trouble, his thumbs are broken, and after this he decides that he needs Bert Gordon to get back on track again. Gordon made him an offer before his thumbs were broken which seemed pretty unfair but now Eddie thinks he has no choice. He has the woman he loves on one side, who could get him out of trouble, and the game of pool and his desire to be the best on the other. What will happen is for you to see.The interesting story about this self-destructive man is also about the self-destructive woman and the events around her are almost inevitable. The hero is a hero in most ways, but it is a hero who must face his weaknesses instead of discovering his strong points. This kind of hero is rare these days. Paul Newman shows us why he became such a great star with this memorable role.Other things are very good too here. Although the game is never explained it is fun to watch every shot, some of them almost impossible. The black and white cinematography looks great. Fast Eddie Felson would return in Martin Scorsese's 'The Color of Money', a lesser film in some points but very good as well.",9,37,57,14 December 2003
My Neighbor Totoro," A great animated film
","Most animated movies, for children and adults, have a hero or heroes and at least one great villain. With 'My Neighbor Totoro' it is different. This movie shows us a wonderful world of animation without a villain. This does not mean the movie is boring or nothing is happening. A lot is happening. There is comedy, drama and suspense but this movie does not need a villain. The only villain there probably is, is the illness the mother of Satsuki (Noriko Hidaka) and Mei (Chika Sakamoto) suffers.I can be short about the story. A father moves with his two daughters to a new home, close to his wife who is sick. The children discover spirits in the forest, not visible for adults. An adventure with the children and the spirits is what follows, with Totoro as the leading spirit.'My Neighbor Totoro' with its friendly and original story is entertaining from start to finish. Hayao Miyazaki, the great Japanese animator, has created a wonderful world with his imagination and animation. Definitely recommended.",8,3,4,16 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," A disaster of a movie
","One day they will make a visual effect-extravaganza with an intelligent story and character we care for. Until that day we have to do it with just the visual effects. 'The Day After Tomorrow' has some great ones and at least it talks about a real problem in the world, global warming. But besides that we have one ridiculous scene after another turning this Hollywood disaster movie into a dumb comedy. Think about a couple of wolves escaping from a zoo when the bad weather starts, staying out of the movie for more than an hour, only to pop up when the central characters go out to find some food in a Russian ship lying in the middle of Manhattan. (Just read that sentence again). That every other creature outside during that hour was immediately frozen is something the wolves don't care about, I guess, so there they are, threatening our heroes. Like the biggest storm we have ever seen on screen was not enough.The heroes here are Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), who predicts the events in the movie, and his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal). Of course there are characters that belong to one of these two main characters and we have Ian Holm who is in Scotland helping Jack with finding out what is happening: global warming causes some bad weather like gigantic tornadoes in Los Angeles and a wave that flushes New York. Then it starts freezing. By the time a lot of people are dead and Sam and a couple of his friends including the girl he loves (Emmy Rossum) are in the library in New York, Jack is in Washington. We already know that you freeze immediately when you are outside in the eye of the hurricane that by then is above New York. Still, father Jack decides to walk to his son for a reason I can not think of. He travels not alone and we can think of the usual clichés the movies will give us. There is no disappointment in that area.Director Roland Emmerich kills a lot of people in his movies. Some by aliens, some by civil war, some by a giant monster and now some by bad weather. The heroes live and even find love so why should we care? I mean, the special effects look great, don't they? That he is pretty good with the special effects made sure I was entertained by 'Independence Day' but with 'Gozilla' the magic was already gone. The trailer for that film was more interesting and the same thing happens with 'The Day After Tomorrow'. The tornadoes, the big wave, the snow, it was all there in the trailer and it really is the only reason to see the movie. I can't wait to see the trailer of Emmerich's next one.",5,0,2,16 October 2005
Hotel Rwanda," Powerful
","'Hotel Rwanda' tells the story of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who used his skills to save over a thousand people during the terrible events that happened in Rwanda in the early nineties. Tutsis were slaughtered by Hutus simply because they were Tutsi, while the rest of the world was looking away. The way the United Nations acted here is portrayed by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the only fictional person in the movie.First we learn about the way Paul, a Hutu, handles things in the hotel; he is a good manager, keeping the important customers happy with little gifts. They may come in handy later in his life. We meet Paul's wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi. Then the massacre starts and slowly more and more people try to hide in the hotel, protected by just a few UN soldiers who are not allowed to use their weapons.In more than one way I was reminded of 'Schindler's List'. Schindler started to save people only to make money, but ended up caring for all of them. Paul's reasons are less selfish than making money, although at first he only wants to save his own family with the power he has. Paul also ends up caring for every single soul he can save. Both men stood up against a greater power with the risk of being killed. 'Schindler's List' is the better movie, mostly because it was amazing how it told a story about one man but gave us a strong impression of the Holocaust surrounding him. 'Hotel Rwanda' has some scenes that have that effect as well, but overall it feels more of a movie that plays on a smaller scale. Of course Steven Spielberg is also a better director than Terry George.Still, the movie is very powerful and moving. Like I said, there are scenes that are close to unbelievable, showing once again what mankind is able to. Performances are helpful here, especially Cheadle does a superb job showing a smart man slowly losing hope. There is one complaint (one that also counts for 'Schindler's List') I have here. The people in Rwanda were not speaking English as their main language, but they were definitely not speaking English with accents. Maybe it makes it more realistic for an English speaking audience, it does not for most others. Just let them speak their original language or normal English. You didn't see the people from 'Gladiator' speak English with a Latin accent either and it worked just fine.",8,5,7,26 October 2005
Snatch," Not as good as 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'
","'Snatch' has a very entertaining beginning and a very entertaining end. It is too bad that the middle part plays slows, is less funny and more predictable. After Guy Ritchie's 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', an exercise in style with a funny crime story, I was expecting a lot. In a way 'Snatch' delivers. Again we have an excellent exercise in style and the crime story is pretty funny. But when you really think about it we have the same again. The reason that the middle part from 'Snatch' is not that good is probably because we have seen it in a movie too close to this one. Fortunately the end takes the movie to a higher level again.We start with Turkish (Jason Statham), who is also the narrator, and Tommy (Stephen Graham). Turkish explains us that he does not know much about diamonds and then the movie is a big flashback. We see how Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) and three partners steal a big diamond in Antwerp and how a lot of people want that diamond. We also see how Turkish and Tommy arrange some illegal boxing matches with a guy named Brick Top (Alan Ford). Brick Top delivers one fighter, Turkish and Tommy the other named Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty). Unfortunately Gorgeous George is wounded when Tommy and George try to buy a caravan from gypsies, including Mickey (Brad Pitt). These are two beginnings of separate stories that will come together near the end.How that happens is something you should see for yourself but it involves Mickey who will be the replacement of Gorgeous George but fails doing what he should do. It also involves Doug the Head (Mike Reid) who knows how to sell stolen diamonds, Avi (Dennis Farina) who is interested in the diamond as is Boris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija). We also meet Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) who helps Avi to get back the diamond. There are more characters but it would make it more confusing if I would mention them.The story, although it is too much like 'Barrels', is still one of the pleasures here. A lot of characters are introduced and for some reason Ritchie is able to make you understand who knows who and why. Reading the connections it is hard to remember them but when it is visualized by a gifted director you will remember. It is a good thing that not everything comes together because that is the way it should be; coincidence has a big part, like we saw in 'Pulp Fiction'.I mention 'Pulp Fiction' because there are other connections. The movie is told not chronological but with constant flashbacks and flash-forwards and there is a moment where you can say: 'This is where we came in.' Like in 'Pulp Fiction' the pieces fall into place after the scenes, during them we are still guessing a bit. Another connection is the dialogue. Not that the speaking style is really the same, but here the dialogue is almost as important as it was in 'Pulp Fiction'. Because it is clearly different from the 'Pulp'-language you can admire it on its own level.For style, visual and in dialogue, for some nice black British humor, for very interesting storytelling, see 'Snatch' but start with 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'.",8,0,1,13 September 2004
Scary Movie 2," A matter of taste
","If you loved 'Scary Movie' you will probably only like 'Scary Movie 2'. If you hated the first film, you will hate this one even more. One stupid sex related joke after another makes a film that is so much a matter of taste it is sort of impossible to review. The film spoofs films such as 'The Haunting', 'The Exorcist', 'Hollow Man', 'Hannibal', even 'Titanic' and a sports commercial (a pretty funny sequence). Some of them work, most of them don't, although I am ashamed to say that I was smiling pretty much.So if you are normally able to enjoy films like 'Hot Shots!', 'The Naked Gun' and the original 'Scary Movie' you must be able to like this one. Prepare for a little more sex and language though.",5,1,6,24 May 2005
Final Destination 2," Stupid, but it works
","To say 'Final Destination 2' is exactly the same as 'Final Destination' would be a mistake. A lot is the same though. What they did with 'Final Destination 2' reminded me a little of what they did with 'Hannibal'. Just more blood and gore. I must say, especially in the first half hour, it works. The opening sequence looks great and bloody and when the first survivor finds his death you heard a lot of 'aaargh' in the theater. Probably what the makers had in mind. After this it gets a little boring and very much the same and of course totally stupid, but I was entertained, sort of.There are some terrific scenes here. Not because they are that great but because they work exactly the way she should. One in particular that involves a dentist made the theater pretty noisy. There is some space for comedy moments as well, making this a nice film. Not as good, if that is the term, as the original, but it works well enough to give it a try.",6,2,4,20 April 2003
Lost in Translation," A funny and beautiful movie
","'Lost in Translation' is one of the best, probably the best, movies of 2003. It is sad and sweet at the same time. Here is a movie that is intelligent enough to avoid the clichés in a story. In a lesser movie certain things would have happened, but not in this movie.Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an American actor who is in Tokyo to shoot a commercial for a brand of whiskey. He is in his fifties and seems almost bored with life. He speaks his wife on the phone but she hardly listens to him. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is in the same hotel with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi). He is a photographer and has to leave for a couple of days. It is clearly he thinks his wife is only in the way. She is in her early twenties.Bob and Charlotte meet and from that moment they spend most of their time together. They wonder through the city of Tokyo, they go to parties, they sit at the bar in the hotel. Every moment between Murray and Johansson is perfect and the last moment they share together is one of the most beautiful moments I have seen in a movie. Although many people have mentioned that moment I will not spoil it if you don't know it yet.Although the movie doesn't sound anything like a comedy, it definitely is. Murray in his best performance, the best of this year as well (although Sean Penn in 'Mystic River' comes very close), stays in character every single moment. There are moments he could become Bill Murray and try to create the funny moments, but he stays Bob Harris the entire time and the comedy comes with that. Scarlett Johansson is almost as good and it is a shame she wasn't nominated for an Oscar (for this movie or 'Girl with a Pearl Earring').Director Sofia Coppola has given us a wonderful movie which I loved in every single way, from the opening shot that makes sure it has our attention until the last final moments between Murray and Johansson. It is the perfect ending for the perfect movie.",10,1,4,21 February 2004
The Grapes of Wrath," Great acting, great direction
","Henry Fonda is Tom Joad in 'The Grapes of Wrath', named one of the best American films ever. The director John Ford is one of the greatest of that time and still belongs to the greatest now. His direction is great. Together with the cinematography, by Gregg Toland who became more than famous with Citizen Kane one year later, they create the perfect atmosphere. Fonda is great in his role and you will remember him. Jane Darwell as his mother is great too. All the performances are good, but these are the ones you will remember. Definitely an all-time classic.",9,3,6,7 April 2003
The Devil Wears Prada," Average comedy, lifted by performances
","In a way 'The Devil Wears Prada' is a very recommendable film. It contains enough laughs for a comedy and is build around a perfect performance from Meryl Streep. On the other hand the film always feels fabricated, with scenes both predictable and unnecessary. We follow a young girl, just graduated, named Andy (Anne Hathaway) who takes the job of Miranda Priestly's assistant. Priestly is the chief editor of a fashion magazine and although Andy gives nothing about fashion, it will help her to get a job for any magazine later in life. Miranda (Streep) is the devil from the title, driving most people around her crazy. Of course Andy's personal life, especially dealing with boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier), will be messed up. Close to Miranda are her first assistant Emily and fashion man Nigel, superbly played by Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci.Reading the above gives you probably an idea of how the screenplay will continue. But the film does not really care for its own story and why should it? It has Meryl Streep. Every single scene is made entertaining by her, and admittedly, Blunt does the same things with her scenes. For some reason it is always fun to see mean people as long as you are able to realize they probably have a good heart. Hathaway is the sweet girl and she is good in playing sweet girls. That said 'The Devil Wears Prada' is basically just another comedy, elevated by performances. Worth seeing, most definitely, but don't expect too much because then it might disappoint you.",7,0,1,28 December 2006
Top Secret!," No 'Airplane!' but still fun
","'Top Secret' is one of the comedies from Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker. During the years they have brought the wonderful 'Airplane!', the very funny 'Naked Gun'-series, two 'Hot Shots!'-movies, 'Jane Austen's Mafia!' and 'Rat Race'. This movie belongs in that list of very funny movies. It is not as good as 'Airplane!' or the first 'Naked Gun' but it comes close.Val Kilmer is Nick Rivers, an American rock n' roll singer, who comes to East-Germany. To tell you the truth I can't remember really why he did that, but of course that doesn't matter very much. In East-Germany he meets Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge). Her father is imprisoned by the East-German regime and Nick wants to help Hillary to find him back. The movie is not really about the plot but to tell more would reveal some very funny surprises.A lot of movie references will pas during the movie, the most obvious are probably from 'The Blue Lagoon' and all the Elvis Presley musicals. It is a little hard to explain the movie but consider a scene where Nick and Lucy want to hide. They pass a closet that says 'Janitor', you see them in almost every building. They open the closet and behind the door we see the actual janitor in a very small space. They close the door and enter a room that says 'props'. In the room we see actual props. There are many of those scene and most of them work. I had a good time watching this.",7,5,11,15 June 2003
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Admiration for Williams
","The best thing in this movie are the songs the DJ gives us. That DJ is funny man Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) and we are talking 1965, Vietnam. I didn't find him very funny, but I can understand if you think that he is. Although I didn't like the character, a man who really was a DJ in the Vietnam war, I admired Robin Williams. With a lot of improvising, may be sometimes trying to hard, he does a great job. My problem is that I only liked some of the jokes and, again, there is a good chance you will not have that problem.The story is mainly about Cronauer. How his superiors try to get rid of him but his co-workers like him, especially Montesque Garlick (Forest Whitaker), how he becomes friends with local boy Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran) and how he is in love with Tuan's sister Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana).It is all a little predictable. Example: Cronauer gets suspended and when they want him back he is not very willing. The sequence where he is convinced to go back, you will know which one I mean, is something that has to be in a movie like this. When you see the set-up you will predict the whole scene right.Again, I admired Robin Williams. The other performances are good as well. I loved the classic songs, I especially liked the sequence chosen during Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World, and of course the direction by Barry Levinson was pretty good. These things make this movie easy to watch, it doesn't get boring either, but I simply did not like it very much.",5,3,7,11 November 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Spectacular, but disappointing
","'The Matrix Revolutions' is not as good as 'The Matrix Reloaded', which was not as good as 'The Matrix', and it is not as spectacular. If you thought 'Reloaded' was a disappointment you will probably not like this installment.The story goes to the attack of Zion and Neo (Keanu Reeves) on a mission to the Machine City, together with Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) try to arrive in Zion on time to stop the machines. Of course Smith (Hugo Weaving) is causing some problems.There are spectacular scenes here, although I think the best were in 'Reloaded', but that is about it. The attack on Zion is way too long, and things simply didn't feel as 'The Matrix' anymore. In the end that feeling came back, a little. The final sequence are spectacular and felt right. Not bad, but compared to the other two movies a disappointment.",7,1,2,19 November 2003
Lilo & Stitch," Fun
","For most part 'Lilo & Stitch' is just a lot of fun. The story about an alien who is created by an alien-scientist as a monster but slowly turns out good in the hands of a little girl on earth is perfect to show all that fun. Lilo is one of those characters from the great creators from Disney that you will remember. Almost every modern Disney film has one of those characters, but mostly they are the villains (Ursula, Jafar, Scar). This time it is one of the good leading characters. He has so many funny moments.Again a Disney film you can enjoy with the whole family, and probably adults will even like it better. I enjoyed it very much.",8,1,1,16 May 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Pretty good, but not as good as the first two
","'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' has an approach a little different than the first two Terminator-films. 'The Terminator' and 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' had some humor but most of all it had great action with beautiful special effects and they were meant seriously. It had some ideas about time traveling that made the movies more interesting. This second sequel does not take itself too seriously. The special effects are there, but the way they play with the time traveling this time is just too much. Fortunately there is some great humor in this one, another sign that you must not take it too seriously.I had a feeling the story didn't matter much, which it did with the first two. Everything was made for some thrilling moments, pretty well done, some great special effects and some nice humor. The new terminator called Terminatrix, played by Kristanna Loken, is nice but the Arnold Schwarzenegger from the first and the Robert Patrick from the second film had something Loken is missing. I didn't like Nick Stahl as well. Edward Furlong was so great in 'T2' that Nick Stahl almost looks bad. The scenes with him and his future wife played by Claire Danes are sometimes a little annoying.May be it sounds like I didn't like the movie very much. That is definitely not true. Because it is a sequel I compare with the other movies from the series and it can't win from those first two movies. But compare it with almost any other sci-fi action movie and this one is better. It is very well made, has suspense and humor and Schwarzenegger is back in the role perfect for him.",8,1,2,25 July 2003
Doctor Zhivago," Long
","'Doctor Zhivago' contains a lot of little stories, all kept together by the character Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif). The movie doesn't really finish one part before starting the next and therefore it kind of feels like a complete movie. Every single little story was interesting enough to like this movie, but as a whole it has a lot of flaws.The story is about Yuri and how he marries Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) but falls in love with Lara (Julie Christie) when he is a doctor on the front. The story is also about the Russian Bolshevik revolution. Yuri is a poet and the new leaders don't like what he has to say, it is too personal. After he gets back from the front and arrives in Moscow he has to flee with his wife, his son and his father. They go to a little place where they try to be happy. In a city nearby he is reunited with Lara and has an affair with her. Then he is taken by the Red Garde and has to be a doctor on the front again.The story also tells us a bit more about Lara and her affair with Komarovsky (Rod Steiger) who has an important role later in the story. During this affair Yuri first sees Lara. All this episodes in Yuri's life are little movies and they are all combined to one. Some of the events are big clichés, but with a director like David Lean the movie gets away with it.I have to say that there is much beauty in this movie. It is not shot on location but I would not be surprised if it was. There is a scene where a house has turned in a deserted ice palace and it looks so beautiful. Because of the beauty, the performances by Sharif, Christie, Steiger and also Alec Guinness as Yuri's half-brother, a fine direction by Lean and the interesting little stories this movie turned out to be pretty good.",8,2,4,27 December 2003
The Shining," Great horror-movie
","This is one of the best horror-movies I have ever seen. Stephen King is a great writer and Stanley Kubrick was one of the greatest directors. Most stories of Stephen King are destroyed by film makers (Sleepwalkers, Tommyknockers), but sometimes they make a masterpiece out of his story (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile). The Shining is another example of a great Stephen King adaptation. Everything is great about it - the directing, Jack Nicholson, the cinematography, the horror - accept one thing. Shelley Duvall is very bad as an actress in this film. I think she was a little annoying in the end, but it didn't disturb me much. The movie was still a great masterpiece.",9,1,2,13 November 2000
Save the Last Dance," Hip-hop Stiles
","'Save the Last Dance' is an enjoyable movie. It has a set-up that we have seen so many times, but after a while little surprises pop up. It is funny too. The movie is about a white girl Sara (Julia Stiles) who once liked ballet and a black guy Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas) who likes hip-hop music. Sara just moved to Chicago to live with her father Roy (Terry Kinney). Her mother died in a car crash. She was on her way to see an audition of Sara, and therefor she thinks it his her fault her mother died. In Chicago she goes to a school with mainly black people. This is where she meets Chenille (Kerry Washington) and her brother, Derek. On a party she tries to dance with Derek on hip-hop music but it isn't really her style. Derek wants to teach her how to dance and after a while they are falling in love with each other.Although all this sounds very familiar there a things here you wouldn't expect. Or you would expect them but they just don't happen. Example: there is a scene with Derek and Sara, in her house, where Sara's father is not supposed to be home for a while. You expect certain things to happen, you probably know what I mean, but it never does happen. Also, the characters feel more like real people than you normally see in a movie like this. They have real emotions and they can think for themselves. There are very funny moments too, the scenes where Sara starts her hip-hop training are great. I am not a big fan of the hip-hop music but in this movie it was pretty good, just because of the images with it.Of course there are some familiar and expected points in the movie. Sara has to pick up her ballet again and Derek has a criminal friend who is not a big fan of Sara. These things is what you expect in a movie like this. But normally you see only this kind of things and I was glad to see that 'Save the Last Dance' didn't settle for them. There was one thing that bothered me. Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas give very good performances, but where Stiles was really young, Thomas was already in his thirties. He was good, but there must have been a younger actor more suitable for the job. Despite this little thing it is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie, with some intelligence as well.",7,3,7,8 August 2003
Collateral," Terrific action thriller
","Here is a film very different from the action thrillers you normally would expect from Hollywood. It takes its time to develop the interesting characters, it does not cut every three seconds, the perfect cinematography is not distracting but adds something to the atmosphere, even the more conventional closing scenes are a lot better than you would expect if I told you what happened there.Cab driver Max (Jamie Foxx) has a passenger named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith). They have a conversation that plays like a real one, again taking its time, and in the end we feel we know these characters quite good. At least better than we know characters after complete films or even series of films. The conversation ends with Annie reaching her destination and after hesitating a little giving Max her business card. We understand she will return in the story. Max's next passenger is Vincent (Tom Cruise). He offers Max a lot of money is he can take him to a couple of addresses, one nights work. Max has doubts but agrees. He stops at the first address, Vincent goes upstairs, a body lands on the car Max is driving. If this was not spoiled in the film's commercials it would be a real surprise.From this point the film develops in a way we expect, but done a lot better than we expect. With each of Vincent's victims the film takes it time to introduce them right until we know them, then the almost sudden, swift action comes and it is done terrifically. On the way some unexpected things happen, they feel like little pauses between Vincent's job. Like I said the third act is a little more conventional but I liked it. Director Michael Mann handles the scenes carefully and therefore he does not step wrong. When Max tries to save the day, of course you knew this, there is real suspense and the outcome is not sure. The same as in Mann's 'Heat', with good guy Al Pacino and bad guy Robert De Niro, you start to sympathize with both Max and Vincent.Michael Mann has made terrific films like 'The Last of the Mohicans', 'Heat' and 'The Insider', had a weaker film with 'Ali' with its strong performances, but returns with this terrific film. 'Collateral' belongs to the best in its genre.",8,1,3,31 January 2005
The Machinist," Very interesting with an impressive Christian Bale
","Watching 'The Machinist' I felt a great admiration for Christian Bale who lost 63 pounds for his role as Trevor Reznik, a man who tells a prostitute named Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) he has not slept in a year. The way Bale looks and acts is very impressive, too impressive maybe, since it sometimes takes the attention away form the film itself.Stevie is one of his friends, Marie (Aitana Sánchez-Gijón) is another. She works as a waitress on the airport and Trevor visits her every day for a cup of coffee and a slice of pie. He works as a machinist where his co-workers are not very fond of him, even less when he causes an accident where one of the other men loses his arm. Trevor was distracted by a person who, according to his superiors, does not even exist. Other strange things occur. Trevor finds little Post-Its with a game of hangman in his kitchen. Who is writing the Post-Its, or do they even exist? Does the man he saw and sees more and more exist? Is Trevor losing his mind?The final moments explain a lot and some things were a little predictable but I didn't care. The movie for me was more about the journey than its destination. What we get to see is how Trevor is feeling and the ending only provides a reason for that. I was satisfied with the answers the movie gave me. Director Brad Anderson with a lot of help from Bale's performance create a creepy atmosphere around Trevor. The movie therefore is effective and basically that is all I wanted.",8,2,3,16 October 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The best yet
","For me this is the best 'Harry Potter'-film yet. The story is better, especially the ending, and the characters are really growing up in this one. 'Azkaban' is darker, scarier than the first two, making it more a grown up film. What also helps for that is director Alfonso Cuarón, known from the terrific 'Y Tu Mamá También', who gives the film a better look. The cinematography is more 'European', if you can say that, and for me that makes the film better.The only point of critique I have has to do with my comments above. The movie feels more mature, a good thing since the book was pretty dark as well, but I feel younger children should enjoy films like this. I guess there are some scenes here that are not very suitable for the kids. Still, the best entry in the series, a highly enjoyable movie!",9,1,2,21 October 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Entertaining enough
","Where some people like Vin Diesel I definitely do not. Where some people like cars on high speed I do not particularly. In this kind of movies I do like action sequences brought to the screen on a certain way. And that is where the movie delivers. The plot and dialogue, the characters, the acting: it is all terrible. But the way they show us the action, especially the cars on high speed, is very good. Because this is the only thing the movie wants to do the movie is actually pretty good. If you don't like this nonsense, just don't watch it. If you do like it, you will like 'The Fast and the Furious'. You probably like the sequel even more!",6,0,1,3 August 2003
Duck You Sucker," Violent, but pretty good
","A Fistful of Dynamite' has the usual elements of a Sergio Leone movie. He made this movie after his Dollars'-trilogy and the best western I know, Once Upon a Time in the West', and before his great crime movie Once Upon a Time in America'. Compared to those five movies this movie is not that big a deal, but compared to most other movies this is actually pretty good.The story has the Mexican revolution as background. The two heroes are Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) and the Irish Sean Mallory who is a wanted criminal in his own country. At first they are not really fond of each other but you know in a story like this that will change. Mallory is an expert with explosives and that gives some of the better explosion-sequences I have seen on a screen.The story is pretty standard but with Sergio Leone as the director it becomes a little more than that. The movie opens with a delightful sequence where Juan steals from some rich folks who just insulted him in many ways. The first sequences between Coburn and Steiger are great as well. Like I said we have the familiar Leone things here. The close-ups do their work and the music by Ennio Morricone fits the movie perfectly.The movie is very violent, with lots of on screen explosion, war violence and executions, but that is the period of time and the background that is chosen. It helps the movie to be more convincing. In the end this is simply a very good movie by probably the best western-director that ever lived.",7,2,8,14 December 2003
Dirty Dancing," Entertaining enough
","'Dirty Dancing' is a movie most people have probably seen. It is a movie a lot of people at least know by name and today that is a little hard to understand. Not that the movie is really bad, but good is something else. And it probably was a little dirty in 1987 but really shocking it was not.The story about Baby (Jennifer Grey) who has to learn to dance to fill in for the Pregnant Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) and who falls in love with dance partner Johnny (Patrick Swayze) is very familiar. Of course she is from a rich family and Johnny is not so there are more problems on the road.Although it does sound I didn't like this movie I have to say I was entertained. The dance scenes look pretty good and the simplicity of other things make it very easy to watch. I think most female audiences will like this movie very much, if you are not female there is a chance you will enjoy it as well.",7,0,0,3 November 2003
Gone with the Wind," A great American classic
","'Gone with the Wind' is one of the greatest American classics ever made. It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, played the very beautiful Vivien Leigh. She is one of the most selfish heroines you will ever see in a movie and still care for her. She is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) but he marries to Melanie Hamilton. She is played by Olivia de Havilland in a great performance. A new man in Scarlett's life is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) but Scarlett does everything to get what she wants including marrying someone for money and her own benefit. Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart, mainly because they are much the same. They both think the world is there for them. Melanie and Scarlett become friends.The movie is set in the time of the Civil War. What happens exactly with Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie is for you to see but the war is pretty important for the story and the way it is used is great. The story itself is great anyway. Although the movie is long it is never boring. A reason for that is the performances. I already mentioned Olivia de Havilland, Clark Gable is very good, charming and sometimes funny, Hattie McDaniel as the black made is outstanding but I have to say that the best thing in this movie is Vivien Leigh. To make you care for a character like that is a pretty hard thing to do, but she makes it seem so easy. It is one of the strongest performances I have seen.Besides the story and the acting we have the music, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography and of course the direction. It is all great. It was made in 1939 and over 60 years later it still is a very impressive movie.",10,102,173,7 January 2004
Tigerland," Interesting
","'Tigerland' is an interesting movie. A lot of what we see looks familiar but most things are a little different. The movie is set in 1971 and we follow a group of soldiers that is about to go to Vietnam. One person seems to be a troublemaker. His name is Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell). Slowly we begin to realize that he is not a troublemaker to make trouble but he is one because he wants to live in his own life, he is against war and violence, he is actually very scared and he just wants to survive. Not only we realize it, the group of soldiers does that too and although some do not like him they do follow him when he becomes their platoon leader. One of the soldiers becomes a good friend, Jim Paxton (Matthew Davis). Another of them becomes his worst enemy, Private Wilson (Shea Whigham), and it looks like he really wants to kill Bozz. The last part of the movie is set on the infamous Tigerland, where the soldiers have their last week of heavy training. The scenes on Tigerland reminded me a lot of 'The Thin Red Line', especially the river where the climax is set.All this probably sounds a little familiar but there are just little differences. In other movies Bozz would never make it to platoon leader. He had to prove himself in actual battle. Here they realize is a natural born leader and although they can't stand him they make him platoon leader, what is the best for the entire group. In another scene you expect that Bozz will get beaten up by one of his superiors, something that would happen in most other movies, but here Bozz asks for his superiors first name, he gives it, and they have a talk.With mostly hand-held cameras the movie looks the way a story like should look. Colin Farrell, not very known when the movie was made, gives a very fine performance. The movie is not great but it is definitely good and interesting to watch.",8,0,1,10 September 2003
Hellboy," Entertaining comic book movie
","When you are watching a comic book movie you have to take certain things for granted. The superpowers, strange villains, things like that. They are there in a non-existing world; saying they are implausible is true but not relevant. What a comic book movie needs is a nice story that is set in its own world (although real existing places can be there too), an entertaining superhero played by an actor who is able to really create the character, spectacular visual effects that fit the action but most of all it needs to breath the right mood. 'Spider-Man 2' did a perfect job, 'X2', 'Blade II' and now 'Hellboy' come very close. The difference is that 'Hellboy' is the first from what will probably become a series.The superhero in 'Hellboy' is, of course, Hellboy (Ron Perlman). How he arrives on earth has something to do with Nazis, around 1944, which we see in the first ten minutes of the movie. Let us say he is just here, present day, on the good side, with a professor named Bruttenholm (John Hurt) as his father figure; he was there when Hellboy came from hell. The villains are the same Nazis, you learn why they are still alive, and a lot of monsters they have created. We also meet a love interest for Hellboy named Liz (Selma Blair) and his new partner, Agent Myers (Rupert Evans).So Hellboy will fight the Nazis and the monsters, but there is more. His father figure is close to death and the love interest, who sets on fire when she is excited, is not really interested. What makes this movie entertaining, besides the right mood we constantly feel, is the dry humor Ron Perlman brings to the character. Hellboy is supposed to be a secret for the outer world although rumors of his existence are there. When Agent Myers goes for a walk wit Liz Hellboy gets jealous and follows them over rooftops where he encounters a nine year old boy. The boy recognizes Hellboy and the scenes that follow the encounter are close to brilliant.There are other very fine moments. At one point a character asks why photographs of UFO's, aliens or Hellboy are always blurry, not very sharp. We see the truth in this question although ironically in a comic book world the question is very out of place; Hellboy does exist. May be this is not the best comic book movie, but entertaining it is. Compare it to another 2004 movie like 'Spider-Man 2' this one seems flawed although we can see the same amount of fun the characters have. Compare it to the dark and brutal 2004 comic book movie 'The Punisher' and this one is terrific, feels like a comic book the entire time, has an interesting hero with humor. That everything around it is pretty silly we just have to take for granted.",7,62,84,28 November 2004
Dog Day Afternoon," Al Pacino is brilliant
","'Dog Day Afternoon' tells the true story of Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale). These two guys went into a bank in 1972 in Brooklyn to rob it. They could have been out in five minuted but things went terribly wrong. Instead of a robbery it became a hostage situation. And a media circus as well.From the first second you will be totally in the movie. Afterwards I wanted to write my review and I was not able to remember how the music was, if there was any. It says something about how much the movie grabs you. The first part is very funny, I laughed a lot of times. The second part is more a drama and a thriller. Great director Sidney Lumet creates a certain atmosphere for the movie that is just right. Pacino in one of his best performances is surrounded by a great supporting cast. He was nominated for an Oscar but didn't win it. He lost it to a guy named Jack Nicholson in a movie called 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'. The chances were probably fifty-fifty and the Oscar went to the better movie, I have to admit that. Still, one of the best performances I have ever seen. With any other actor this movie was a nice one, with him it is a great one.",9,62,72,13 June 2003
No Man's Land," Satire in the style of 'Wag the Dog'
","'No Man's Land' is the film that unexpectedly took home the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film; most people thought it would go to the French 'Amélie'. The reason this did not happen has probably to do with the themes of both movies. 'Amélie' is a modern fairy tale about little things that make people happy, about love, about something we see in a lot of films. (Although almost never as good as in 'Amélie'.) 'No Man's Land' is a movie about the former-Yugoslavian conflict. It is a movie like 'Wag the Dog'. Both movies are about something that could happen, shown in an exaggerated story to make it a satire.Both movies are equally entertaining, sad in different ways. 'No Man's Land' starts with a group of Bosnian soldiers. It is the middle of the night and the fog is the reason they have no idea where they are. Daytime. The men are between the Bosnian and Serbian frontline, not a hard target for the Serbs. The Bosnian soldiers are all killed but one, Ciki (Branko Djuric).He ends up in a trench in no man's land. The Serbs send two soldiers to check the situation. They arrive in the trench, put a mine underneath a dead Bosnian body (a surprise for those who will pick him up) and find out that there is a Bosnian survivor. One of the two Serbs is killed by Ciki, the other wounded. His name is Nino (Rene Bitorajac). Now both men are in the trench in no man's land, both men want to get out alive.In a Hollywood film the two would become friends I guess. 'The Iron Triangle', set in the Vietnam-war, comes to mind. This is not what happens here. First the dead Bosnian on the mine turns out not to be dead at all. Cera (Filip Sovagovic) is his name. The three come up with a plan to get all out alive. This leads up to the arrival of the UN, a French delegation. They are ordered to leave the field by their superior (Simon Callow). A British news reporter (Katrin Cartlidge) catches that conversation and threatens the French UN soldiers to transmit this. This makes sure the UN has to do something. In the meanwhile the conflict in the trench is not over.I must say no more about the story. Basically it is there to support the satire. The two men in the trench show us with their dialogue how both parties look at the conflict, we see how little the UN can do, we see how things always change into a media circus. The ending is the most like 'Wag the Dog', showing how the media and the world can be mislead by powerful people. Maybe the event in this movie is implausible, but I believe there are stories like this one that really did take place. 'No Man's Land' is a good movie and works as a satire, but it is no 'Amélie' that shows us the most important thins: love!",8,0,2,16 October 2004
Moulin Rouge!," The movie musical
","Moulin Rouge! has one of the most simple stories I know but it comes in the most beautiful package I can imagine. Almost nothing is new in the movie, but all that old stuff together is one of the most original things I have seen.We have a forbidden love packed in a movie musical. All the songs used sound familiar but totally new at the same time. We hear a beautiful version of Your Song from Elton John and a refreshing version of Roxanne from The Police. We hear so much more songs we recognize but don't know. The only original song, Come What May, is a beautiful one as well. The actors all do their own singing. It is terrific.Sometimes the screen seems hectic, but it is all in favor of the atmosphere of the movie. Nicole Kidman is gorgeous and great in her part as Satine, the courtisane who falls in love with the poor writer. Ewan McGregor is that writer and he as well does a tremendous job. I loved the supporting roles: John Leguizamo as Toulouse, Richard Roxburgh as the Duke who wants Satine because he pays for the new play they will do in the Moulin Rouge, and especially Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler, the boss of the Moulin Rouge.The story doesn't matter very much, it is the way the whole movie is brought to us. In living colors, with bright actors, terrific settings and costumes, perfect voices for beautiful songs, a sharp cinematography, all put together by a very good director, Baz Luhrmann. The movie musical is back and if you need some evidence, watch Moulin Rouge! 10/10.",9,3,6,2 February 2003
Meet Joe Black," A bit too long, but a fine movie anyway
","'Meet Joe Black' is a movie that could raise a lot of questions and a lesser movie probably would have. Here I accepted what the movie was telling me and I enjoyed the story, Anthony Hopkins and the charm of Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani.A guy (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Claire Forlani) meet, flirt, probably fall in love and both go their own ways. The guy is hit by a car and Death takes his body to find out more about life. You hear me right, Death itself looks like Brad Pitt and he visits Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) to tell him he is going to die. Bill must show the life on earth to Death, who is introduced by Parrish as Joe Black, and in return Bill can live longer. Bill is a very rich guy, loved and respected by almost every other person in the movie, and it happens to be that Susan turns out to be his daughter. Of course Joe Black is not the guy she met that same morning, and although she notices strange things, they do fall in love. Death falls in love with a human being, but I didn't ask any questions.There is another story. Bill, the rich dying man, is in the middle of a deal concerning his own company. He has to take Joe everywhere so people start getting suspicious and in this way the movie creates a real villain since Pitt can't be it. This story was not really necessary but it makes sure we know how to feel about every character.Like I said, this movie has some things that make sure it works. The story is sweet with a good heart, probably stupid in a way, but we don't need to care. I didn't even want to. Hopkins is great, like almost always, and especially the way he speaks adds something to his perfect performance. Pitt shows why he is such a popular guy and may be it is true that his performance is a little overdone at times, he seems too aware of who he really represents, his charm pulls him through. Especially in the scenes together with Forlani, who is at least as charming, Pitt finds the right note for his character. The last thing I want to say is that the movie is a little too long. I wasn't bored once but I realized some scenes were not necessary, especially near the final moments. I was able to not be bothered by this, and I guess you can do the same.",8,0,0,28 March 2004
Garden State," One of the most delightful films of the year
","When a good project does not come to you, you just have to write it yourself. After that you don't need a director to mess up your stuff so you might as well direct it. Something like this must have gone through Zach Braff's head before he started with 'Garden State', a delightful film that could have stepped wrong many times but basically never does. It tells the story of an actor, not very successful, named Andrew Largeman (Braff) who takes a plane back from LA to New Jersey because his mother died. He has not seen his father Gideon (Ian Holm) in nine years for reasons I will not reveal. In Jersey he spends time with old friend Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) and meets a very nice girl named Sam (Natalie Portman).May be the story sounds a little like something you have seen many times, but I can assure you that you have not. The friend Mark is not your typical friend, the way his relationship with Sam develops is not your typical romance and the problems Andrew had and has are not the typical problems. The only time the film does a feel a little familiar is near the end, but admittedly it is the only ending every viewer of this film wants. The funny moments are not forced the way we normally see that, the characters are just being themselves and sad and funny moments occur. You can actually believe the characters have a life out of the framework we call 'Garden State'.Braff gives us an Andrew who is close to the opposite of J.D. from the series 'Scrubs'. Here he is sad and quiet, in the series he is funny and feeling like a young boy all the time. I like the series and I love Braff there; making me forget about both things while watching 'Garden State' is quite an achievement. Portman as Sam is the light of this film, bringing warmth and creating most of the funny moments. Holm and Sarsgaard find the right note for their character that are more complex than they seem at first.Braff's writing is quite impressive. In the romantic scenes he does not go for clichés, and in the dramatic scenes he finds dialog that is used in real life. Especially the scenes where Andrew faces his father are so honest you forget that what's on screen is fictional. As a first-time director he does a pretty impressive job as well making me looking forward to his next project. The camera captures one beautiful image after another, the soundtrack fits the film and creates the right atmosphere. All this makes 'Garden State' one of the year's most delightful films.",9,1,2,23 January 2005
Donnie Brasco," Depp and Pacino in terrific movie
","For some reason a Johnny Depp movie is always interesting. Whether it is a biopic about Ed Wood, a dark fairy tale about a man with scissors instead of hands, a movie about the greatest lover the world has ever known or a adventurous story about pirates, Depp's performance alone makes it worth seeing. Here he plays FBI-agent Joe Pistone who goes undercover using the name Donnie Brasco. He becomes a wiseguy with the help of Lefty (Al Pacino), who is sort of a loser wiseguy who desperately needs to be a mentor because most of his mafia family members look down on him. Donnie comes as a gift from heaven and it does not take long before Lefty trusts Donnie completely. The problem for FBI-agent Donnie is that he's starting to like Lefty as well.The movie is a gangster movie but has its focus on the relationship between Lefty and Donnie and sometimes on other relationships. Donnie, or Joe, is married to Maggie (Anne Heche) who he hardly sees. He can not exactly tell her what he is doing and sometimes stays away for a couple of weeks. She pretends she is a widow to deal with it. We also learn about the relationships in the mafia family, including new boss Sonny (Michael Madsen).The fact that this movie is more about the people and their relationships than about the events is a good thing. Sure movies like 'Goodfellas' are terrific but to see something a little different from time to time is nice as well. If you make a movie about people and their emotions you need to have some good performers to make the scenes believable. I already mentioned Depp but of course we have Pacino here as well. His Lefty is a memorable character and it is Pacino who makes sure that happens, but the fact that Depp is as good and especially believable as heavyweight Pacino says something. Of course we have Madsen who was probably the only right actor for the macho mobster Sonny.Director Mike Newell seems to be a strange choice for this sometimes very violent and bloody story since he directed the terrific but sweet 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. Fortunately it turns out he is the right man for this material, probably because its real subject is not gangsters but, like I said before, the relationships between the characters. 'Donnie Brasco' has enough to offer for people who like the gangster-genre, but even if you are normally not a big fan there is still a chance you might like it.",8,112,129,17 September 2004
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Visual feast
","Tim Burton's 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is one of the nice animated movies not from Disney. It is about Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, who lives in Halloweentown. One day he goes through a door in a tree and arrives in Christmastown and sees how happy and beautiful it is over there. When he is back in Halloweentown he shows his friends what Christmas is like, and he suggests to do Christmas this year instead of Halloween. Things do not go as planned.Everything is beautifully animated and although the story is not that great it is entertaining the whole way through. I liked all the songs in the movie and there are some good laughs as well. Definitely worth watching.",8,47,78,2 November 2003
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Terrible sequel
","I can be pretty short about this sequel to 'Resident Evil': it's terrible. I mean, I was able to find some joy in the first film even though it made no sense at all. This one makes no sense at all and misses the ingredients that made the first film watchable. It does contain a fine looking Milla Jovovich and another actress (Sienna Guillory) that makes it easier to watch, sort of telling us this film really is for teenage boys only. Well, the ones older than sixteen since this is an R-rated film. And it's about zombies, by the way.There are good films about zombies, the undead, the living dead. George Romero made them, '28 Days Later' or 'Shaun of the Dead' are recent examples. The original 'Resident Evil' belongs not to this category but at least it had some moments of suspense and tried to give us a story, whether you found it stupid or not. Here there is no suspense, just a little gore, and the story is not really there. The events from 'Resident Evil' were underground in a place called The Hive. After Jovovich survived it was locked forever to keep the virus that turned people into zombies. Why they want to keep it I do not know, but let's not ask questions here. Now they want to reopen The Hive. The Hive by the way, is located in Raccoon City, a city that can only be accessed by one bridge.The Hive opens, the virus is still there, including the zombies, and the virus spreads through the city. Now they quarantine the city and people who are still in it have to save themselves. The Umbrella Corporation, the most powerful corporation in the world, is responsible but will do anything to keep their virus. They have created a secret weapon, codename Nemesis, a creature that seems to be invincible. Now the group that includes Jovovich and Guillory have to survive not only the zombies, but the creature as well. A man can help the group, navigating them with the help of his computer, but they have to save his daughter first. Jovovich has a little secret of her own.I realize I have spend too much on the story since it basically is a group of people walking through a city with zombies popping up from time to time. They are shot in a stylized action sequence and the group continues. No fun here I would say. If you liked the first film or the computer game the film is based on you might find some joy, but you can do so much better. This film offers nothing we have not seen before. Here it is always night therefore the action is hard to follow, making it even less interesting. Don't waste your time on this one is basically all I want to say.",4,3,7,28 April 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," Silly fun
","'From Dusk Till Dawn' is kind of brilliant, brutal, bloody, Tarantino, horror, silly and funny. It is brilliant, brutal, bloody, horror, silly and funny the way Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead'-series is all those things, the twist here is a screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino. This means the first hour is just brutal and bloody, sometimes a little funny, in the 'Pulp Fiction' kind of way.We see two brothers named Seth (George Clooney) and Richie Gecko (Quentin Tarantino). They are bank robbers, although they do the occasional killing as well. We learn they want to reach the Mexican border. That the entire state of Texas and the FBI are looking for them is a problem so they force the Fuller family to bring them across the border with their motor home. Father Jacob (Harvey Keitel) used to be a minister but gave up faith after his wife died in a car crash. He travels with his adopted son Scott (Ernest Liu) and his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis).So we have the first hour, filled with Tarantino-stuff in its dialogue and references, and then the party arrives at a bar called the Titty Twister. Not long after they are inside it is revealed that every crew member from the bar is actually a vampire, feeding themselves on bikers and truckers that visit the place. The Fullers and Geckos survive together with a guy who calls himself Sex Machine (Tom Savini) and a guy named Frost (Fred Williamson). Now they are a team and face vampires as their opponents.You see how this movie is actually two movies. Especially the second part will find a smaller audience and in a way I was a little curious how the first part would have ended if they kept it as serious as it was. Still, because the movie shifts the way it does it becomes quite original. We have a crime movie to start and a horror comedy, really in the Sam Raimi way, to end. If you are able to take it the way it comes, not too serious, there is a good chance you might like it. Even the gore is presented in a silly way, making it less gory.Clooney's cool performance, the fitting soundtrack, some hilarious moments, Tarantino's fine touches all make this a highly original, quite bloody, vampire adventure. If you are a genre fan don't miss it, if you are not you might give it a try and be pleasantly surprised.",9,124,154,21 November 2004
The Last Emperor," Impressive
","'The Last Emperor' tells the story of Pu Yi, as an adult played by John Lone, the last emperor of China. He was three years old when he first sat down on the Dragon Throne. He didn't know anything. The movie tells his story from that moment in flashbacks. We also get to see Pu Yi when the Chinese Communists have the power and he is imprisoned. Because people have taken care of him the rest of his life, from three years old to the moments inside the prison, it still feels he knows nothing.To tell you about the life of Pu Yi would be a mistake. You have to see this movie to learn more about it. The strange thing is that Pu Yi can not do and decide much for himself. He is a hero of a movie where he is controlled by rules and other people. That is one of the reasons not many real things happen. We see the emperor grow up, we see him take an empress and a concubine, and then he has to leave the Forbidden City because the enemy is at the gate.The impressive thing here are the locations and the costumes. Everything looks fabulous and it is not a surprise to find out that the movie was shot on location. With all the extras in those beautiful costumes there are a lot of very impressive scenes. May be the movie is a bit too long for some, it didn't really bother me. Director Bernardo Bertolucci has made a terrific movie.",9,64,78,26 December 2003
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," A rock musical about a transsexual
","'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' is a rock musical about a transsexual from East Germany. Although this does not sound like something I would like to see, I was pleasantly surprised. The story is about Hedwig (writer director John Cameron Mitchell) who comes to the United States. To leave East Germany a sex change was necessary, although it wasn't completely successful, hands the 'Angry Inch'. We see how (s)he falls in love with Tommy (Michael Pitt), how they sing and play together and how eventually Tommy steals all of Hedwig's songs and becomes a rock star. Hedwig is a little mad and with her band she now follows Tommy everywhere he goes on his tour.I am not sure why I liked this movie. Mitchell's performance is perfect and of course that helps. Hedwig's emotions are very clear to us and you feel sorry for her. I also liked the songs, something I thought I would not do. Of course this is just a matter of taste, but I think it helps a lot for people to like or hate the movie. It should not do that actually, since the story itself is interesting enough. Whether you will like it I don't know but with an open mind I guess there is a good chance you will.",9,0,1,7 April 2004
This Is Spinal Tap," Cult classic
","By many seen as the favorite cult classic (together with 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show') 'This is Spinal Tap' is truly a comedy masterpiece. The rockumentary about fake band Spinal Tap seems so honest and serious that the slightest joke gets a huge laugh. We follow the band together with a documentary filmmaker, played by director Rob Reiner, on a tour that must make sure they will have a comeback. We see some of their shows where things go wrong, we see how they argue about the cover of their album, and we see how a girlfriend almost destroys the band.The movie handles all these events as serious as possible, presenting itself as a real documentary about a real band. The fact that the band members are not too bright makes it funny. Especially the scene where the lead singer talks about an amplifier that goes to eleven instead of ten and therefore produces louder sounds is hilarious. The scene where the band plays on a Stonehenge stage is a classic, very memorable.Writer Christopher Guest recently wrote and starred in 'Best in Show' (2000) and 'A Mighty Wind' (2003), two hilarious and terrific fake documentaries, the so-called mockumentaries, but 'This is Spinal Tap' stays the classic example. He and his co-writers, including director Reiner, have created the ultimate cult classic.",9,50,65,14 October 2004
Mission: Impossible," Better than most action thrillers
","'Mission: Impossible' is sort of like an entertaining 'movie: impossible'. To understand the plot completely and to really believe the things we see on the screen are pretty impossible, but it does deliver what it promises. I was able to put the confusing parts aside and enjoy this well made action thriller.The movie starts in Prague with a team of agents on a secret mission that includes Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Jack (Emilio Estevez), Sarah (Kristin Scott Thomas), Claire (Emmanuelle Béart) and her husband and also leader Jim (Jon Voight). Things go terribly wrong and Ethan is the only one who survives the mission. He meets with his main superior named Kittridge (Henry Czerny) only to find out they were looking for a mole. Since he is the only survivor they think Ethan is the man they want. Of course he escapes and to find the real mole, or at least discover the truth, he contacts the person the mole was working for, codename: Max (he turns out to be a she with the face of Vanessa Redgrave). Since a lot of people are looking for Ethan he decides to help Max and deliver what she wanted from the original mole. He does this with the help of Claire, who survived after all, and two other men (Jean Reno and Ving Rhames) who used to work for the same organization as Ethan did.I guess what I have written above is true, but completely sure I am not. It is hard to complain though. The action is terrific and there are at least five singles scenes that could have been entire movies. To give you an example, Ethan has to retrieve something for Max from the CIA head quarters. Since he is a wanted man he has to steal it in a difficult way, of course. This turns 'Mission: Impossible' temporarily into a heist movie with events that could fill complete movies like 'Heist' or the terrific 'Ocean's Eleven'. The movie moves so fast that you can't even realize you don't get the plot entirely.Maybe in the end the movie has trouble to make the right choices but on the other hand it gives us the kind of action we want. Much better than the sequel 'Mission: Impossible' is a movie that delivers. Brian De Palma's direction makes sure we get what we want in a nice way.",7,0,1,2 July 2003
The Last Samurai," Terrific but long
","Here is a film that looks very good with its costumes, art direction, set design and cinematography, has some terrific performances, a beautiful score and a fine direction by Edward Zwick ('Glory', 'Legends of the Fall') and unfortunately an ending that could spoil things for a lot of people. If you forget the ending 'The Last Samurai' is a very good movie.In short: Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) becomes a military adviser for Japanese soldiers to defeat some Samurai leftovers. He is captured by the Samurai and starts respecting these real warriors. He becomes a Samurai as well, sort of, and helps the Samurai for their next battle against the Japanese soldiers. Of course there is a women to make things a little more interesting.Although the film is an action adventure it is not really about the action, which is its strength and its weakness. The film is more about honor and such things if you look at the story, but besides that it is all about the things I mentioned above; art direction, set design, costumes, cinematography. Although it is great too look at the entire time, even during the final sequences, the film is too long. It seems nobody wanted to erase some of the beautiful images. But when the action arrives, it is very well done. You can see Cruise trained for a long time for these scenes. Although it is a little too long and has an ending that is instantly forgettable, I enjoyed 'The Last Samurai' more than I expected.",8,1,2,16 November 2004
National Treasure," Good old fun
","'National Treasure' is too long, silly and very entertaining. It is no 'Indiana Jones' but it has as much fun with its adventures and characters; that makes it more than worth watching.It stars Nicolas Cage as a treasure hunter named Ben Gates who believes a secret map on the back of the Declaration of Independence will lead him to the greatest treasure possible. Together with Riley (Justin Bartha) he will have to steal the thing to protect it from Ian Howe (Sean Bean), his former partner who is after the treasure as well, at any cost.While stealing they encounter the National Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) and of has to come along to provide Gates with a love interest. She does not believe them at first, but of course she slowly changes her mind. After stealing the Declaration not only Ian is after the three, also Agent Sadusky (Harvey Keitel) and the rest of the FBI. In the second part Gates' father (Jon Voight) pops up as well, becoming pretty important in this silly story.Indeed the story is silly and could be even stupid, but Nicolas Cage is the kind of actor who can make things like this sort of believable. Together with fine actors like Keitel and Voight, a Kruger who is much better here than in 'Troy' and Bartha who is very funny, they create an entertaining and at times very funny adventure instead of just another film. That it is too long is hardly noticeable.Do not take it the least serious, just try to enjoy. There is a very good chance you will.",7,1,3,12 January 2005
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Interesting, but also slightly disappointing
","What director Pier Paolo Pasolini does with 'Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom' is making a point a lot of people already understand. Those who do not will probably not get this film either. In the most simple way you can say that the film shows us what happens when an unchecked regime has all power. Pasolini uses the fascists and places the events near the end of WW-II. Sex and violence and the desire to power are very much connected, Pasolini thinks and shows.The story itself exists out of nine boys and nine girls being physically and mentally tortured, most of the time sexually. This is done by four Libertines and the people who support them; well dressed people with the sickest of ideas. Although I thought the scenes were either disgusting or disturbing the film itself is not that unwatchable. Not that it is for everyone though. The stories told in the film are more disturbing than most of the things shown, and the only really disgusting scene deals with excrement and eating.What Pasolini does, one thing I particularly admired, is show human nature in the most evil way. And I am not just talking about the fascists here. To survive we do about anything, and some sequences of betrayal show how merciless people can be, maybe even more so in conditions like these. These sequences also show that even though it seems there is no future, there is always time and especially need for sex. In this case 'normal' sex, without any humiliation or torture.The admiration for this piece of work is overshadowed by some aspects. Again, it makes a good point, but with the horrors of the Nazi's and Italian fascists in our memory we don't really need a film like this to show that again. The interesting parts are in the details, like I described above. I was fascinated, a little disgusted, and in the end slightly disappointed. That said I am very glad I have seen it, probably without seeing it ever again. I would recommend to try that as well.",6,7,11,25 November 2006
Rocky," A great Sylvester Stallone film
","If you think Sylvester Stallone has made nothing but stinkers you just have to see 'Rocky'. This is a brilliant film, based on Stallone's own screenplay, where he plays a complex character in such a terrific way it is not strange people thought this was going to be a great actor. Compare it to another great film about a boxer, 'Raging Bull', and 'Rocky' will be better at some points. It goes without saying that it's quite an achievement.The story is about Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a boxer who once had a glorious future, but now fights for little money in gyms. Then, out of the blue, he gets the chance to fight the heavyweight champ Apollo (Carl Weathers), a stunt from his side. Although Rocky seems to have no chance he starts his training to make the best of it, although at first he is too proud to accept any help. The scene where he finally accepts the help from his old trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is one of the best scenes in the film. Rocky also starts dating the very shy girl Adrian (Talia Shire), sister of his friend Paulie (Burt Young).'Rocky' is a terrific film in every aspect. The acting is what amazed me the most. Stallone gives such an impressive performance it is very hard to believe he is also the star of films like 'Over the Top', 'Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot' and 'Judge Dredd', and from the other 'Rocky'-films for that matter. Not only Stallone is impressive, Shire, Young and Meredith find perfect notes for their characters as well. Every little thing that happens seems natural through their acting and of course Stallone's screenplay does a great job here. Director John G. Avildsen serves this material the way he should. Of course he is no Martin Scorsese, 'Raging Bull' stays the better directed film, but he knows how to tell this story.I do not like boxing very much, so a boxing-film is not something I would enjoy. But this is not a boxing-film, it is a film about a boxer. It tells about a character who happens to be a boxer running for a title. This is probably one of the points where the other four 'Rocky'-films fail and where films like this one and 'Raging Bull' and Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' succeed.",9,86,116,18 February 2005
Pretty Woman," A great love story
","Sometimes you have a romantic comedy that is remembered for a long time. Movies with Audrey Hepburn, 'When Harry Met Sally...', little parts from other Meg Ryan-movies and... 'Pretty Woman'. Of course we have the famous song and the real launch of the Julia Roberts career that help a little but it just is one sweet and very funny movie.Julia Roberts is great in romantic comedies and especially with this movie (and 'Notting Hill') she proves this. With Richard Gere she has a perfect chemistry and in the end that is all we want to see. That Roberts is a prostitute and Gere a very rich man, living in a penthouse, make things only more interesting, joke-wise. One of the better romantic comedies made in the past and definitely one to watch again. And again. And may be again.",8,39,60,16 August 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," For entertainment it is a masterpiece
","'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is one of the most entertaining films I know. You can look at it and not worry about anything because you know it will all be alright. Very true to the book it reaches the same level. Daniel Radcliffe is the perfect Harry Potter, Emma Watson a great Hermione and Rupert Grint a very funny Ron Weasly. With the famous story, a great direction from 'Home Alone'-director Chris Columbus, a perfect casting and some nice special effects this is the way a movie like this has to be. Be entertained by the world of the wizards.",8,3,6,3 August 2003
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Terrific, more mature, although a little rushed
","The fourth installment of the 'Harry Potter'-series is probably the most entertaining of them all for it's wall to wall action and comedy. For some this can also be a problem. The story is a little rushed. It is like a road trip where you only do the attractions on the way, but never travel from one attraction to another. Of course that is an entertaining way to do a road trip but it can be good to catch your breath from time to time, enjoy the world around you.This counts especially for a world as beautifully visualized as Harry Potter's. Art direction, set decoration, costumes and visual effects are once again terrific, creating a feast for the eye. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasly (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) inhabit this world as if they have lived there their entire lives; not only the movie but also the actors are more mature. The story has grown darker with every new film and here it deserves its PG-13 rating. Death and destruction are pretty present in 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'.I could go into the story, which deals with a deadly tri-wizard tournament that Harry enters even though he is too young and the first real appearance of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), but it does not really matter. The story is a nice framework to show us everything in the movie, also including brilliant performances by Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody, Miranda Richardson as journalist Rita Skeeter and returning actors like Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and a great Alan Rickman as Severus Snape.'The Sorcerer's Stone' and 'The Chamber of Secrets' gave the series its magical touch, it was a little lost in 'The Prisoner of Azkaban', for me still the best, but director Alfonso Cuarón made up for that with especially the cinematography. Now we have 'The Goblet of Fire' where magical touches have changed mostly into darkness, maturity and some great action and comedy scenes. It seems to me this is the right approach to the series.",7,1,8,30 November 2005
Three Colors: Blue," Beautiful and quiet
","'Trois Couleurs: Bleu' is the first out of three movies directed and co-written by master Krzysztof Kieslowski. This is the story of a woman Julie (Juliette Binoche) who loses her husband, a famous modern composer, and her daughter in a car crash. She deals with this tragic event on her own way.Blue is the first color on the French flag and it stands for 'liberté', which means freedom. Julie moves away to an anonymous place in Paris where she is free of her past, and therefor free of everything. From here on she has the freedom to do everything she wants.The movie looks beautiful. Of course the color blue is seen a lot. In her old house she even had a 'blue room'. Juliette Binoche is perfect as Julie. The movie is not one of the most happiest and most fun to watch ('Blanc' from the same trilogy is a little happier for example), but there are so many beautiful things to enjoy. Just enjoy this great quiet movie.",8,1,2,6 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Wow, those special effects
","A rollercoaster ride from start to finish is probably the best thing to describe 'The Matrix Reloaded'. It is one of those sequels that comes close to the original, not only because it really is almost as good, but because you are overwhelmed by what you see on the screen. 'X2' did a pretty good job earlier this year and another good example is 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day'. Yes, the things you see on the screen...We left 'The Matrix' with Neo as The One, ready to start the war to free all human slaves. He has learned how to fly, which sounds a little stupid but is brought pretty convincing. He is having dreams about Trinity set in the future, where she is shot. Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and some new crew members arrive in Zion, the last human city. Morpheus has a speech there and after that they party. The party is the first great sequence. Sentinels are digging to Zion so things must be done. Morpheus thinks Neo is the answer but not everyone believes in the prophecy so there is some resistance. Neo has to see the Oracle to know more about what to chose, and there we see the second great sequence, probably the best action sequence I have ever seen. Updates of Agent Smith attack Neo and of course he fights back. I will not reveal more of the story but the last great sequence is a freeway chase, and that is probably the second best action sequence I have ever seen. Between those great sequences we have some scenes with action or romance, and some very funny moments as well. No, you will definitely not be bored once.If you only want to see sci-fi action 'The Matrix Reloaded' is as good as it gets. Personally I think it looks even better than 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' and we know how that looked. Unfortunately I don't want only sci-fi action. Of course I enjoyed but sometimes the Wachowski Brothers take things a little too far. There is one scene in particular, you will know which one I mean. And although the story is good with a complicated one like this there have to be flaws and there are. It didn't bother much for me, but I can understand if it does for you.'The Matrix' was new on a lot of levels, unfortunately things can't be new twice. So 'The Matrix Reloaded' just uses the new things and multiply the action by ten, and it works for most part. One last thing. It is always said that the writers meant it to be a trilogy. 'The Matrix' ends and if there is a sequel or not, you can feel satisfied as a watcher because the film has a real ending. To me it seemed a little that it was not sure if those sequels would ever be made. 'The Matrix Reloaded' has sequel written all over it and so it ends without a real ending. Again, it didn't bother me much but those are little things.'The Matrix Reloaded' as just eye candy and sci-fi adventure is better than the original. As you watch it for the whole movie it comes close but then the original is better. Anyway, if you liked the first you will enjoy this one as well.",8,0,1,16 May 2003
Mystic River," Perfect performances in Clint Eastwood's great film
","'Mystic River' is one of the year's best films and one of the main reasons of that is the performances. Like in 'Lost in Translation', what in my opinion was the year's best film (although 'Kill Bill' and 'The Lord of the Rings' came close), every actor does a perfect job in creating a character with its own emotions and therefore they could be real people.Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins) were friends as kids. One day they were playing on the street and Dave is taken by two men, pretending to be police officers. For four days he is abused by the men and this terrible event has changed them all. Now they are all grown up. Jimmy has a second wife, Annabeth (Laura Linney). He has two daughters with her and an older daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) from his previous marriage. She is found beaten and dead in a park. Dave is one of the main suspects. He is married to Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) and has a little boy. Sean is one of the detectives put on the case. Together with Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne) he must solve this mystery. Another suspect is Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry). He was Katie's boyfriend and they were leaving for Vegas. Jimmy hated Brendan, we learn why that is.In a way 'Mystic River' plays like a detective movie. The plot is intriguing and we wonder what really has happened. But this movie doesn't end there. It looks further, closer to the characters and their emotions. There is suspense in dialogue between characters when they are explaining what they are feeling and what they really think. Director Clint Eastwood has made a movie with a creepy atmosphere the entire time. His direction is one of the other great things in this movie.Back to the performances. The best performance in the movie is from Tim Robbins. In every scene you feel what has happened to him as a kid. He even uses vampire movies as a metaphor to how he feels. Sean Penn has a great performance as well. He is not as good as Bill Murray in 'Lost in Translation' but comes close. Penn sometimes goes a little over the top where Murray was always perfect in character. Kevin Bacon seems to have the easiest part, but you can see the pain he constantly feels. He has a pregnant wife but she has left him. She sometimes calls him but doesn't say anything. Bacon does a great job in showing us how he feels.Smaller parts are very good as well. You forget Fishburne was playing Morpheus in 'The Matrix'-trilogy almost immediately. Marcia Gay Harden is probably the best from the supporting cast although Laura Linney, and especially her final creepy moments, comes close. Linney's performance is to small to really see how good she plays it. Tom Guiry as Brendan, who is not the best known here, surprised me in a very positive way. The more the movie develops the more he shows us how good he is.Clint Eastwood has made his second-best film after 'Unforgiven' with a great story, adapted by Brian Helgeland ('L.A. Confidential') from the book written by Dennis Lehane. Together with his own music and his actors he creates a creepy atmosphere and has the nerve to not simply play that out. Giving the characters real lives is a movie you don't see very often anymore. Eastwood does it and Penn, Robbins, Bacon, Linney, Harden, Fishburne and Guiry make sure they are believable.",9,5,9,28 February 2004
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better than the first
","I liked the first 'Harry Potter'-film. It wasn't a masterpiece but it was very entertaining. This film is as entertaining as the first.I liked this one a little better since we know the characters now. The visual effects were better than in the first film, and a funny performance by Kenneth Branagh is added in this one. I also liked Dobby, a new computer generated character that punches his own head when he wants to punish himself.The story was exciting and clever. Although that was more the work of J.K. Rowling the screenwriters did a great job adapting the book. A great adaptation and a story for almost the whole family, may be not the smaller children.",8,0,0,8 January 2003
The Departed," Martin Scorsese as we like it
","Leonardo DiCaprio shines in Martin Scorsese's new gangster movie 'The Departed'. Mat Dammon, Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and especially Mark Wahlberg throw in their talents as well to make this one of the most entertaining films of the year. I would go as far to call this the most entertaining film Scorsese had made since the great 'Goodfellas', although his 'Casino'' came pretty close. This is simply what the man does best, lifting an average story up to greatness. This is not an attack to the original 'Infernal Affairs' on which this film is based on, which was great as well, but the Scorsese magic is seen here in all its glory.The plot circles around two infiltrating people. One of them is an undercover cop named Billy (DiCaprio) who joins the team of a gangster named Frank Costello (Nicholson). The other is one of Costello's man named Colin Sullivan (Damon) who joins the Boston police department. These two young men are trying to discover the identity of the other and at the same keep their own identity covered. Sheen, Baldwin and Wahlberg belong to the Boston police, all playing their part in this complex tale. I say complex, but Scorsese makes sure the audience knows who is who and why they act the way they do.I have said about enough about the plot, which is more fun if you do not know too much. For this film is probably best if 'Infernal Affairs' is not seen either. If you do not have too much problems with the bloodshed we have seen in earlier Scorsese films this is the film for you. Technically brilliant, uncompromising, and arguably the most entertaining film from 2006, from start to finish.",9,3,6,4 December 2006
Scream 2," Pretty good sequel
","The funny thing with 'Scream 2' is that it's not as entertaining and good as 'Scream' but with bad movies like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Urban Legend' it's kind of a relieve. Probably the difference here is that Wes Craven is  a director who knows what he is doing.Neve Campbell as Sidney, Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquette as Deputy Dewey and Jamie Kennedy as Randy return for this sequel. New possible subjects or suspects are Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Hallie (Elise Neal), Sidney's new boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell), former suspect Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who was in prison for a year, Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and reporter Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) who is a big fan of Gale.The movie opens in a theater. The movie 'Stab' is showing for the first time and this movie is based on the book 'The Woodsboro Murders' by Gale Weathers. In 'Scream' Sidney predicted that Tori Spelling would probably play her if they would ever make a movie about those events and in 'Scream 2' we learn she was right. It is one of the many funny little things. Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps are killed during the showing and of course the movie is blamed.From here it is like 'Scream'. The guessing can begin. Again it is a lot of fun, again the movie knows that it must not get too serious, again I was entertained by what I saw. 'Scream' was original and therefore better, more entertaining and more surprising in the way the subject was handled. Still, with all the inside jokes and references this is a lot of fun and a lot better than almost every other movie in the genre.",6,48,71,13 December 2003
The Mission," It looks great
","'The Mission' looks so beautiful that you almost forget the other things that can make a movie good or bad. That the story isn't that great and that some things don't make much sense is too bad but there is enough here to enjoy. The cinematography of the beautiful nature is great. Every shot has something beautiful in it. The music composed by Ennio Morricone is great as well.We also have Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons with nice performances. The movie was directed by Roland Joffé who directed the great 'The Killing Fields' and he does a nice job here as well, most of the time. The fighting sequence in the end was hard to follow. Like I said the story is not that great either but it will not bore you at all. If you like one of the actors and beautiful nature you will definitely like this movie. Otherwise you might like it as well, but that is not sure.",7,2,5,12 September 2003
Stalag 17," Not Wilder's best, but still very good
","'Stalag 17' is a movie about a German POW camp with American prisoners in World War II. All of them are sergeants. The movie starts with the death of two of two of them while escaping. They must be betrayed. The movie is a kind of whodunit in that way and the secret stays a secret for a long time, also for us, which is a very good thing. The only thing we do know that it is probably not Sgt. J.J. Sefton (William Holden). Every prisoner in his barrack suspects him because he has nice little deals with the Germans. Then a Lt. James Dunbar (Don Taylor) arrives in the camp. He is accused with bombing an ammunition train and he must escape from the camp before he is taken to Berlin, probably for execution. Of course they have to find the informant first or Dunbar will die anyway.The movie has some dramatic elements like the deaths of the two who escape in the beginning, but in my opinion the movie shows the camp a little too friendly. It seems that the live there was not so hard, and I guess it must have been terrible. Leaving that the movie is great. There are a lot of funny and exciting moments. The twist near the end is a nice one and the performances are very good, although sometimes it is a little too much. Especially a character named Animal (Robert Strauss) seems to be more like a cartoon figure than a real person. It doesn't make much of a difference. Director Billy Wilder has made another fine classic.",9,3,9,29 June 2003
The Terminal," Delightful Spielberg comedy
","If there is one director who can lift simple entertainment up to a level most directors only dream of it is Steven Spielberg. The best examples are probably 'Jaws', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' and 'Minority Report', working with genres like horror, adventure and science-fiction that show events normally not seen in normal life. 'Catch Me If You Can' is a perfect example of a film about human lives that could go wrong in many places with a lesser director, but never does. 'The Terminal' has the same quality. Both films are based on true but unbelievable stories. A lot of films based on true stories go terribly wrong anyway, not with Spielberg.Tom Hanks, one of those actors with also the ability to make things better than they normally are, plays Viktor Navorski, a man from a fictional country arriving on JFK Airport. While he was in the air a coup was committed in his country and therefore the new government is not recognized and accepted by the US, therefore Viktor's country basically does not exist. That brings a little problem, his passport is not valid so he can not enter the US. Of course going back to a country that does not exist is quite impossible as well. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the customs official, tells him to stay in the International Arrivals Lounge until he is beeped and told what to do. Dixon is hoping he will leave and try to enter the US anyway so it is no longer his problem, but good guy Viktor obeys.A solution to this problem is not easily found, apparently, so Viktor lives in the Lounge for a long time. In this time he befriends people, even starts loving a flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The Dixon character becomes the villain, sort of, although Spielberg makes him a real character with real grounds on which his actions are based on. Tucci finds the perfect note for this characters. There are some subplots, mainly to support Viktor's story, but they are handled with care. One of them in particular has to do with the guy who arranges the food for the planes, Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna). He loves the girl who rejects Viktor's request for entering the US every single day (played by Zoë Saldana) and makes a deal with Viktor. He gives Viktor food, Viktor contacts the girl and learns things about her. Of course these scenes are probably there to provide funny moments for Hanks, who plays his Viktor close to perfect, but the scenes never feel like that. They just play like they belong in this story and they happen to be funny.All the little stories are played the way they should. Even the Zeta-Jones plot, one that seems obvious in what direction it will go, is handled in such a perfect way you keep wondering what will happen. That Spielberg is a good director and Hanks a good actor is a given. Here they prove it once again in a delightful comedy that plays, another impressive fact, on a very large set that looks perfectly like an airport. Yes, really delightful with a lovable leading character and a lot of lovable supporting characters in a feel-good story for everyone to enjoy, which is occasionally very funny as well.",8,1,2,10 February 2005
Saints and Soldiers," Not very original
","'Saints and Soldiers' is not a bad movie but every single element is something we have seen before and that makes it an un-interesting movie. Even the dialogue feels very corny at times, not because it is that bad, but because we have heard a thousand times before. May be the makers should have approached the material a little different to make it interesting, because now it is a movie that I would not recommend.The story about a couple of US soldiers and one British soldier behind enemy lines after a massacre starts with a very impressive scene; the massacre itself. After this the movie gets very boring for almost an hour, although there are some nice images for us to watch. In this boring part we have some predictable moments that could be suspenseful but were not, and the dialogue that gets annoying. When the action arrives again the movie gets a little better. I liked the cinematography during the fighting sequences so I was able to enjoy these sequences.To say more about the simple story is not very necessary. You can understand that this story is something we have seen a lot. The massacre, the hiding behind enemy lines without food or weapons, the help of a stranger, the wounded friend, the trick to save themselves. If you normally like these kind of films I would not be sure with 'Saints and Soldiers'. May be the cinematography during the fighting sequences will be enough for you, it was not for me.",5,4,12,16 May 2004
Casino Royale," Craig is perfect for this kind of Bond
","How about that. 'Casino Royale' is the best Bond-film since 'Dr. No' and especially 'Goldfinger'. I have to admit, I thought this with 'GoldenEye' as well, with Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, but with every next movie it went more downhill. I hope this will not happen with this James Bond, played by Daniel Craig. The actor here is perfect for Bond and that has to do with some of the changes Bond has had, seen in this film.Craig shows us a Bond who is new to his job and in the story he really is. When the film starts he is not even a 00-Agent. He becomes one after killing two men in a black and white preview that sets the tone of the rest of the film. The villain for the real story is Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a banker who finances freedom fighters, or terrorists if you will. The Bond-girl is Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), M is still M played by Judi Dench. Bond's mission is to win Le Chiffre's money in a big poker game in the Casino Royale so he can't finance terrorists and he needs MI-6 to protect him.So much for the plot which is not really what makes this Bond better than most of its predecessors. It is the raw tone and the more human characteristics Bond has. Where Brosnan was buried in corny one-liners and technical gadgets, including a ridiculous invisible car in 'Die Another Day', Craig is most of all human. He has the car, but the films does not depend on it. Here we see a flawed Bond, one that makes mistakes, even the biggest one there is in his profession. He falls in love. I have to admit that the scenes around his love play to fast and the series, or is it the character, seems unable to handle it the right way, but it does not really matter. There is also quite some fun with what we know about Bond from earlier films. I hope Bond will stay as he is here, and the films will stay as low-key as here.I mentioned the raw tone. There is a scene that challenges the PG-13 rating in which torturing is the main event. Especially this scene shows why Craig is perfect for the role. Brosnan has had his torture, but not this kind, and look how they both act on it. Brosnan was good, but Craig seems needed to keep the series interesting. Like the first Brosnan, the first Craig is directed by Martin Campbell, which seems no coincidence. I hope he will do more, or at least I hope other directors will follow the tone he and Craig have set. This is probably the first time I am really looking forward to the next installment of the Bond-series.",8,1,3,4 December 2006
Trainspotting," A long video clip
","I find it hard to review a movie like 'Trainspotting'. The reason for this is that I can understand why people do not like it. I did like it. Actually, I think it was very good. I do not agree with people who say that this movie is pro-drugs. It has a more realistic view than most movies that deal with this subject and that fact alone makes it worth watching. After 'Trainspotting' I thought I understood a little about addiction to heroine.Although it deals with a serious subject 'Trainspotting' is a comedy. I never laughed out loud very hard but with a lot of moments I found myself smiling. Especially the character Begbie (Robert Carlyle) had some great moments. He is the only one not addicted to heroine. The main character is Renton (Ewan McGregor) and he is surrounded by Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), Tommy (Kevin McKidd) and Begbie. We see how they use their heroine, how they try to stop doing that, how they do nothing at all, how they live.This movie could be very boring. The actors make part of the movie work, director Danny Boyle takes care of the rest. He has made the movie into a cool video clip that lasts an hour and a half, never boring. This is probably the main reason why some people don't like the movie and I can't blame them. The style here is one you can like or hate, it is just a matter of taste. Again, I liked it.",9,0,2,7 March 2004
Signs," Thrilling
","This is a very scary movie. The way M. Night Shyamalan makes it scary is an amazing achievement. Most of the time there is nothing to be scared of, but you will be. His direction and a great cinematography make this film a unique experience.If you don't like movies about aliens and supernatural things you can still like Signs. It goes much further. It is about faith and about the questions if everything happens for a reason or not, if everything is meant to be or everything is just coincidence.Mel Gibson has a very strong performance. Joaquin Phoenix and the kids, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, are great. The kids did remind me a little of Haley Joel Osment and his strong performance.Overall this is a great movie. The climax is a great one. If you really think of it not much has decided in the end, but it doesn't matter, it is perfect the way it is.",9,3,9,21 February 2003
Amélie," Finds its charm in the little things
","'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' finds its charm in the little things. The story about Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is a modern day fairy tale and that is exactly how it looks the entire film. We have a wonderful story about Amélie who decides to help people around her, making them happy. Not by doing great big things or giving money, but by little things. She helps her father by making him believe that his gnome from the garden is on a trip around the world, she helps a lonely neighbor by just visiting him, she helps a stranger by returning something she found in her home. On the way she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) who's hobby it is to collect photos from automatic photo booths. Photos that were tossed away because people thought they didn't look good enough. He puts all those photos and pieces of photos in a big book. There is a little mystery in the book as well, of course I will not spoil that for you. The story is not only sweet and charming, it has some great moments of comedy as well.The movie looks colorful and bright almost constantly. Even the sad parts from Amélie's life, her youth for example, look almost strangely happy. In this world, Paris actually, Audrey Tautou is the perfect inhabitant. She has one of those faces that seem to smile the entire time. She looks like she just pulled a joke and she is waiting for you to find out what it is. In a way her character is really doing that here so it does not feel strange.In short 'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' is charming, funny, romantic bright and full of life. This is the perfect lighthearted movie.",9,202,251,14 August 2004
The Sixth Sense," Good
","'The Sixth Sense' is a good movie but it depends too much on its ending. So much has said about it that the surprise there was less surprising. In my opinion a lot of people think about the surprise exactly as it will turn out, something that would not have happened if it was unknown that the movie had such a special ending. Of course I will not reveal it and I have to admit it is a great ending for a movie.There are some scary or exciting moments and the story develops in a pretty good way, but it plays a little slow. Some people will even say it is boring in some parts and I can understand that opinion. Other things make up for this. Bruce Willis, Toni Collette and especially the young Haley Joel Osment give some very fine performances, there is a creepy atmosphere throughout the movie and the direction from M. Night Shyamalan is great.",9,0,1,7 November 2003
Final Destination," It works so why bother
","'Final Destination' does not make any sense. The movie is not meant to be to make any sense so why would we bother that. It is supposed to be scary and it really is scary, sometimes. Although things are silly it is kind of original as well. A couple of people escape death because one of them had a vision. Because they messed up the plan death had for them death comes up with a new plan to kill the survivors. One by one they die but one of them, Alex (Devon Sawa), sees the design, the path that death follows. Together with the last survivors they are going to cheat death. One of them, Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), feels what Alex sees.You understand things don't have to make sense here. Right before the first time the group survives we see the vision Alex has. It is more than scary. After that things are a little the same but there are some nice ways to make a death scary. Like the sequel it is stupid but it works.",7,1,4,28 June 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Classic horror
","If you are not a horror fan but have to name one horror-film most people will come up with 'A Nightmare On Elm Street'. Other possible pictures they might mention are 'Halloween' or 'Scream', in my opinion more thrillers with horror-elements. The scariest of them all, 'The Exorcist', could be a real contender as well. Still, 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' is so well-known, at least the title, I could not believe the actual film could live up to the promise. I have to admit most of the time it does.The idea director Wes Craven exploits here is as simple as it is brilliant. Teenagers are chased by killer Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) in their dreams. The nightmare becomes reality because Freddy is able to actually kill these kids in the dreams, causing their death in the real world as well. Instead of misleading us with a scary moment that ends with the 'only a dream'-scene, we know when the characters are dreaming and we know that it is as dangerous as facing a killer outside a dream. The first victim is Tina (Amanda Wyss). This is a little surprising since she is introduced as the hero, the way Janet Leigh seems to be the hero but is killed in Hitchcock's 'Psycho'. After Tina a couple of possible victims are introduced. Tina's best friend Nancy (Heather Langenkamp), Tina's boyfriend Rod (Nick Corri) and Nancy's boyfriend Glen, played by first-timer Johnny Depp.The film follows some of the usual paths, but Wes Craven shows he is the kind of filmmaker that has little surprises for you on the way. We think we can guess who will live and who will die but even in that area there are more surprises than you might think. The scenes where it is sort of certain someone will die are directed in a way there is lots of suspense anyway. Craven showed this again with the parody on itself, 'Scream'. It is too bad the sequels, except for the last one, were without involvement of Craven. I am not saying 'Scream 2' and 'Scream 3' are terrific films, but they are entertaining, something you can not really say for the first five 'A Nightmare On Elm Street'-sequels. Fortunately Craven returned with 'New Nightmare', unfortunately you have to sit through part 2 to 6 to fully appreciate that one. A good reason to simply start with the original and best 'A Nightmare On Elm Street', after that you might think about the others.",8,0,0,11 February 2005
Ran," Very well made
","One of the last great films directed by Akira Kurosawa. A father gives his land and his power to his three sons. They turn against each other and against their father.Based on Shakespeare's King Lear 'Ran' is a very good film. It was very expensive and you can see that. Over ten years Kurosawa was busy on this project and in 1985 it was finally there. Very well made, with beautiful costumes, music and cinematography, a great direction and some good performances. Although I think Kurosawa has done better ('Rashomon', 'Ikiru', 'Yojimbo' and of course 'Shichinin no Samurai') 'Ran' definitely belongs to his best.",9,38,54,13 April 2003
Cube," An interesting movie
","'Cube' is an interesting movie with thrilling moments and a great look. The movie looks so great that other things can feel a little disappointing although they are pretty good as well. The only thing that didn't impress me very much was the dialogue.A couple of people find themselves in a room in the shape of a cube. In every wall they see a door. Behind every door they find another room in the shape of a cube. Every cube has its own colored light, and every door has a number. How did they end up there, why are they there and why have some rooms deadly boobytraps? We don't know and the characters don't know, although they have their secrets.One of them is a cop, another is an escape artist. We have a doctor, a mathematics student, an autistic guy and someone who doesn't speak very much. Together they must survive and find out what is going on. Since the movie is set in a cube the entire time there are moments we can imagine what the characters are thinking and feeling. The dialogue in these scenes doesn't work because it doesn't add anything and therefore it seems in the wrong place.But like I said there is enough to enjoy here. The mystery is pretty nice and we only know what the characters know and that has its fun. Every time the characters enter a new cube we have a thrilling moment because we. and they, can't be sure if the room has a secret. Because 'Cube' is so different from the movies we normally see it is at least interesting to watch. Whether you like it as much as I did is for you to decide. In my opinion there is enough to enjoy.",8,5,10,1 February 2004
Fantastic Four," Entertaining enough
","There is something in 'Fantastic Four' I have been waiting for: a superhero who thinks his superpowers are really cool, even calling his new fitting suit a 'costume'. I know that Robin from 'Batman Forever' had the same thought, but he had no superpowers, just a lot of gadgets, a mask and a cape. Some x-men maybe shared the thought as well, but the negativity against mutants made it different there. So, back to 'Fantastic Four' and the reason I bring this little thing up at the start of this review. Although this may not be a flawless entry in the superhero-genre, it is one that has some new ideas. Together with entertaining characters and story, some humor and nice visual effects what can go wrong in a superhero movie?Nothing really, as 'Fantastic Four' proves. As did 'Blade', 'X-Men', 'Spider-Man', 'Hellboy' and even 'Daredevil'. These films are not flawless but made in the right way, finding out not only how to work as a comic book but also as a movie. 'Blade', 'X-Men' and 'Spider-Man' all got sequels that were better, showing they had learned. For a first film 'Fantastic Four' brings the right stuff, for its sequel it has to improve. But that's for later.The story centers around four heroes all with their own power, which they got from radiation while being in outer space. I spare you the details. The leader is Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) who is elastic. His love interest is Sue (Jessica Alba), the invisible girl with some extra powers. Her brother is Johnny (Chris Evans), who can turn into a fireball. Last but not least there is Ben (Michael Chiklis) who has turned into a man made out of rock. He is the muscles from the group. The villain is Doom, once named Victor Von Doom (Julian McMhaon), once lover of Sue, also infected with the radiation. I guess that is all you need to know.The powers and villain are interesting enough to keep our attention while the human story behind the heroes makes it more interesting than it could have been. I could have done without the love story between Reed and Sua, but you simply got to have it these days. Near the end the film is rushing a little, but they took quite the time to get the story underway. To keep the movie withing the two hours it seems like a wise decision. Further than these things I have little complaints, especially considering this is the first 'Fantastic Four'-effort. If the characters develop and the humor stays the same, we might have something here when the sequel arrives.",6,2,4,18 December 2006
Gangs of New York," Daniel Day-Lewis is superb
","This is a film that has the potential of a masterpiece, never is, but often comes close. It is a very good film, no doubt about it. I can't say what makes the film less good than the masterpiece it could be because everything is pretty great.The story is about Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) who runs Five Points in New York with his gang. They have a big fight with another gang, the 'Dead Rabbits'. The leader of that gang, Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson), is killed and his son Amsterdam Vallon witnesses everything. 16 years later he is Leonardo DiCaprio and he seeks revenge. A lot has changed. I can say more about the story but I don't want to give too much away. There's one sub-plot involving Cameron Diaz as the love interest.The movie looks great. The costumes, setting, basically New York around 1846, looks perfect. The cinematography adds to this as well. DiCaprio is a good lead although almost every other character is more interesting including characters played by John C. Reilly, Jim Broadbent and Brendan Gleeson. The best thing in this picture is Daniel Day-Lewis. When he is on the screen you don't watch anything else, simply because you can't. He is so impressive, so great. For me it is the best performance I have seen this year (although Adrien Brody in 'The Pianist' comes close). He alone makes this movie worth watching, but fortunately there is much more to enjoy in another good film from great director Martin Scorsese.",8,1,2,26 January 2003
Gladiator," Great, most of it
","I have seen 'Gladiator' a couple of times now and I still think it is a very good movie. But the more you see it, the more you notice little flaws. The story is about a general Maximus (Russell Crowe) who is chosen by emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to become protector of Rome after his death. Instead he becomes a slave because the son of the emperor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), kills his father before anybody knows his wish. Maximus is sold as a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed) and he trains gladiators. Maximus has to make the crowd love him to make it to the Colosseum, to face Commodus who thinks Maximus is dead. Most of the story is fictional.There are a lot of good things in this movie and they almost make you forget the bad things. The movie opens with a battle between the army of general Maximus and a Germanian army. The set-up is great. We see how the Roman army is preparing for battle, with a lot of little details, and how the Germanian army arrives at the battlefield. After this the actual battle is a disappointment. Where everything looked great right before it all started, you can hardly see anything during the battle. Here the editing, cinematography and even direction or not very good. The only thing that is still great are the costumes. I admired them in every shot of the movie.After this the real story, the one I told you above, begins. Most of the things from here on are very good. Russell Crowe is great as Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, who is Commodus' sister Lucilla and an old love of Maximus, are very good as well and veterans as Derek Jacobi (as Senator Gracchus), the late Oliver Reed and the late Richard Harris simply disappear in their characters. The animated Rome looks great and new in one way but therefor a little too perfect, too animated, in another way. The battles in the arenas are pretty good, although the last one is a little too much fiction. You will know what I mean. The ending is the one you expect, a real Hollywood ending, but it doesn't spoil the movie.Last but not least I want to mention the music by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. This is one of those scores you will remember. It is perfect in every scene of the movie. This beautiful score, great acting, a fine direction by Ridley Scott and some exciting battles make this movie very entertaining and still one of the best movies of 2000.",8,0,2,21 September 2003
Pocahontas," Nice Disney film, but not as good as previous ones
","This was a nice movie. After great Disney movies such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King I think my expectations were a little too high. It couldn't live up to those mentioned but this movie still is worth watching. Although the story isn't that much, a couple of nice songs, the voice of Mel Gibson, some funny characters including a dog dressed as an Indian and a beautiful animated Pocahontas make this a nice Disney to watch. 7/10.",8,0,4,24 January 2003
Shark Tale," Fun for adults
","I liked 'Shark Tale'. It is funny and has quite some original elements I will not spoil for you. But while I was watching I realized how many jokes were there intended for adults and how little for children. Since I guess you have to label this as a family film I was wondering if that was really the intention of the filmmakers. I mean, the main inspiration comes from R-rated films 'The Godfather' and 'Jaws'. Other little jokes and one-liners find their origin in films like 'Scarface', 'Gladiator' and 'Apocalypse Now', again R-rated.All those great laughs, for me at least, will not be funny or even remotely understood by children.That said, let's approach this film as a comedy mainly made for adults. Again, adults will probably find this very funny, even funnier when you have seen quite some films. The story tells about Lenny (voice by Jack Black), a shark who happens to be a vegetarian, a disgrace for his father Don Lino (Robert De Niro). This shark makes a deal with a small fish named Oscar (Will Smith). On the reef where Oscar lives they think Oscar killed another shark, Lenny's brother, so Lenny and Oscar try to keep the rumor that way. Subplots involve Oscar's longtime friend Angie (Renée Zellweger) who is secretly in love with him, a new fish Lola (Angelina Jolie) who likes Oscar now he is famous, and Sykes (Martin Scorsese), a fish who used to be Don Lino's partner but now teams up with Oscar. Sykes has two helpers, the funny sidekicks any Disney-film would be proud of.What can I say more about this film? The animation is good, although I liked the approach with 'Finding Nemo' better. On the other hand, this is the kind of film where realistic animation probably would be out of place. Now I have mentioned 'Finding Nemo' I could compare it a little more. 'Nemo' is the better film since it is equally funny for adults and close to the perfect film for children. 'Nemo' was simple in its story but very inventive as well in the little things. Think about the fish with short term memory loss. Things like that you will not find in 'Shark Tale' but you will have many laughs and smiles. Especially the one-liners taken from other films were hilarious but I have to say again; you must have seen the other film to really like it. I did, I laughed.",7,3,4,18 April 2005
