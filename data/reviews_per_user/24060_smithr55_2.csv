Vertigo," Once again, bow down, scrape your heels, knuckle your forehead... for no good reason at all!
","****Spoilers Inside****I watched this so-called masterpiece for a class assignment (and I was actually looking forward to it, so I can't be held to expectations of poor quality), and I can only think of one word to explain my feelings on this movie:WHY?Why is this considered one of the best movies of all time?  Why do people continually bow down to something just because it's 'the definitive classic?'  Why did they leave the unnecessary 30-45 minutes in there?  Why was this film so horrendously acted, directed, filmed, and edited?Where to go on... Ah yes.  The plot:The plot was a wonderful concept.  A nice couple of twists, the story set up well and ready to hand off for a touchdown, but somewhere along the way, the runningback decided he should run a few laps around the field, in randomly alternating directions, before finally meandering in and taking a knee at the one-yard line and settle for a field goal.The acting:  Stiff, over-done, 'no-sir-audience-i'm-not-reading-my-lines-from-cue-cards' crap.  James Stewart was quite possibly the worst choice.  He only has one speed: 'Merry Christmas Bell Tower!'  Every movie I've seen him in he's been the same idiotic dimwit.  His intended affable, lovable goofy exterior only irritates, frustrates and makes you want to set fire to the videotape or DVD it sullies.  Kim Novak was hardly any better.  Her cookie cutter character, 'I-dare-you-not-to-love-me-NOWAIT-I'm-untouchable-NOWAIT-help-me-NOWAIT-i'm -insane' would have been served up more convincingly by James Stewart himself in a dress.  At least he has a whopping two modes to his emoting.Editing and Directing:  Why did Midge exist?  She provided no conflict save for that weird thing she did with the painting.  She provided no resolution. She didn't even serve as a voice of any particular sway (i.e. the viewer, the voice of reason, the voice of emotion etc).  An amazingly sexist viewpoint (I know, surprise, it was the 50's) pervades.  The women are stupid, naive, weak-willed and two-dimensional.  There were so many unnecessary camera shots, such as nearly all the various scenes during the 'I'm-following-Madeline-with-my-intense-stare-of-concern-and-intrigue' car sequences.Quite frankly, I'm so disgusted with this movie, I can't really go on with any intelligent critiquing.  I wish I could say that we've grown as an industry and learned our lesson about contrived, pointless plots with big names displaying less than tolerable acting capabilities, but only a fool would ignore Pearl Harbor.Maybe we can salvage the concept.  Do a remake.  Anything today would vastly improve upon this sorry waste of my time.My score: .08/10 for the potentially breakthrough but saddeningly mundane plot.",1,120,221,7 December 2001
Love Actually," Well balanced subtlety and honesty
","** Mild Spoilers **By far one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  The plot, if not incredibly in depth, never bogs down, and keeps you continually engaged in each character's life.   I found myself several times just as one event was concluding, wondering what was happening in another's character's life, only to be taken right to them moments later.Special appreciation to the wonderfully done relationship between Daniel and Sam, and Aurelia and Jamie.Two themes I've found in people nay-saying the movie:  political/social commentary and nudity.We must not forget that film makers and writers have the privilege in the free world to comment however they wish on the choices those in the political arena make, just as they do social trends.  The right to question and examine these things is what makes movies independent art and not just propaganda.  More specifically, the Prime Minister-U.S. President relationship issue in the movie may be a chance for Americans to get a very real look at how those on the other side of the Atlantic view the single man 'chosen' to represent all of us.  You don't have to agree with it, but don't close yourself to its possibilities.As far as nudity, aside from the fact that there are a few scenes with frontal exposure, I've most definitely seen more sexually aggressive subject matter in prime time network T.V.  While perhaps superfluous, it was in no way pornographic, as reviewers and critics have lamented.  And don't forget - we now have a rating system that tells you point blank if there is nudity. The doe-eyed parent has no grounds to cry foul over an unexpected nude scene.It is absolutely the most engaging movie about all the various incarnations of love I have ever seen.  It was heartwarming, real, and a real affirmation that good movies can still be made in our era of plot-less sequels and fanatical jingoism.",10,0,1,7 December 2003
