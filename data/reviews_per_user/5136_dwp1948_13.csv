Deja Vu," An Excellent Suspense/Thriller Movie - What We Always Expect From Denzel
","05/01/2019 Viewers will become immersed into this movie right away. There are 'NO' bad Denzel Washington movies, then couple that with one of the very best directors ever, Tony Scott who is known for directing action and thriller films such as Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop II, The Last Boy Scout, True Romance, Crimson Tide, Enemy of the State, Man on Fire, Déjà Vu, and Unstoppable. Tony died in 2012. Great movie. Bon Appetit",9,0,0,2 May 2019
Minority Report," This MovieTook Me Forever To Get Into Even With Big Name Actors
","05/30/2020 The first half of this movie was a scrambled egg mess. To much dramatic music/noise, computer driven graphics do NOT make a movie mainly because nothing of value has taken place. Not until interest has been created can the viewer be drawn in. For me that only came about during the second half. This movie was over filled with 'time filler' segments of OK everybody, now let's run/now let's fight/OK let's argue, all of it strung together and presented to viewers as a storyline. Not like the rave reviews that I read beforehand. Bon Appetit'",5,0,3,31 May 2020
Train to Busan," #1 Best Blood Thirsty ZOMBIE Movie Ever Made - Real Fast Moving S.Korean Zombies
","04/09/2019 This is a real docu-movie that was made in N.Korea, not S.Korea. How could I know? I was there and I'm pretty sure that I saw Kim Jong Underwear. You'll know him right away, he's the fat one running (kinda slow) with the brown stains in his skivvies. That's from the back. Up front he's the yellow belly. These Zombies are the really fast scary ones, the Kimberleys knot sew scare-we. I escaped by hiding in the toilette. I mean down deep inside the toilette where there was a great big load of **** just like the **** that I've been feeding you in this review. Excellent movie, my third watch.

Molly's Game," Definitely Worth Watching - Fast Paced - Intricate Gambling Details Interwoven Into The Storyline
",05/02/2020 Enjoyable movie about an ambitious young woman who takes control of a series of high states poker games for profit and power. She experiences both the highs and the lows of her chosen enterprise. An easy watch for viewers with rapid dialog that keeps the brain invested. Watch for yourself and you can help decide it's IMDB rating fate? Bon Appetit',9,2,2,3 May 2020

No Country for Old Men," A Perfect Movie - Great Cast - Excellent Storyline - Life Like Acting - Wonderful Movie
","04/19/2019 This movie is one of the few that I tend to watch over and over again, it never seems to get old much like Clint Eastwood's greatest movie 'Unforgiven'. This is a 21C classic that will still be entertaining movie watchers long after we're all dead and gone. Perfect !!! Bon Appetit",10,1,1,19 April 2019

Sinister," Loud Bang Noises & Dark Rooms Camera Work Does 'NOT' Make For A Scary Movie
","05/03/2020 The first half of this movie has us watching some NOT very believable actor (Ethan Hawk) who is pretending to be scared over every noise he hears. Enter in one scorpion and one snake that invades his new house plus an old movie projector and super 8 film upstairs and he's on fear overload going all crybaby to cops when he falls downstairs. The writer and director think that by filming every situation in really dark rooms with loud banging noises plus roaring drum noise/sounds make viewers soil their adult 'Depends'. This turd fest did not work for me? Mr. Potatohead aka Daddy thinks using his really dim cellphone light as a flashlight in his under electrified house is A-OK. Conveniently he finds that old super 8 killer tapes with projector in his attic (lucky him) showing crimes committed where he now lives. this is a preposterous storyline, poorly presented to viewers as a horror movie that many of us NEVER find scary. The last 30 minutes is your reward. Ethan SUKS. Bon AppetitAddendum: The 'Grinch That Stole Christmas' has a small part in this movie, much like Fred Thompson and Vincent D'Onofrio.",5,1,2,3 May 2020

Hart's War," Nothing Special - Just A Bruce Willis/Colin Farrell Showcase - A One Time Watch Only
","04/08/2019 It's OK, just uneventful and mediocre by my standards. Any real storyline, I missed. Take it or leave it, doesn't matter. Bon Appetit",6,0,1,9 April 2019
Valkyrie," An Excellent Historical Movie - Never Exciting - Just A Great Movie
","03/17/2019 Enjoyable movie especially knowing it's fact based. The neigh sayers regarding Tom Cruise's performance are self centered morons. He was excellent as always. Great movie, well worth watching several times (three times for me), just to pick up details missed the first time. Bon Appetit",10,3,4,17 March 2019
