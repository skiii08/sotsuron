10 Cloverfield Lane," Much Better Than Average Shocker Film - 10 Cloverfield Lane
","With a bravado performance by John Goodman, who should have been nominated that year (I mean DiCaprio for the Revenant? and Damon for The Martian?....please), 10 Cloverfield Lane takes you from the first five minutes and holds you until the last ten minutes (which, quite frankly, disappointed me). Suffice it to say the ending was overwrought and unlikely, but then again, the whole film is overwrought and unlikely, but extremely entertaining. I just would have preferred a different ending. The direction of the film is letter-perfect and Winstead gives a great performance as well. The story is well-written and is paced perfectly. A film that is much better than the former Cloverfield film.",6,0,0,29 August 2019
Detroit," Disappointing: Not The Actors' Fault
","Let me be very clear; the actors in this film are top-notch, but they were directed and handed scripts by amateurs. The writing is horrendous, and as another astute reviewer noticed (Mr. Crowford), this film was not realistic in the time frame it was supposed to be in. In addition to the authenticity issue, I found the stereotypes of whites in the film to be offensive, although mildly amusing. Of course, we are used to seeing stereotypical black characters portrayed in several films, and we usually recognize them when they appear. One token 'good' police officer does not get the job done for accuracy. There were several dozen white (and black) officers hurt during these riots; not one of their characters were examined.The actors do the best they can with the very shallow script, and I was impressed with several of them, but they sounded like kids at a high school play in several scenes because of the script and indecisive directing. This film could have been so much better, but when political hijacking takes over good filmmaking techniques, it usually results in an inferior product.Arthur H Tafero AskMrMovies",4,24,48,13 August 2017
Se7en," Seven is a Dark winner
","Silence of the Lambs. What comes to mind when you hear that title? A deranged genius vs a good guy. This film is similar in many ways, although not quite as polished. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as good guys are fine, and Kevin Spacey as Hannibal Lecter's best student is fine as well. The story is told in excellent suspense technique, and the dark, rainy atmosphere provides the emotional setting that is a proper visual for the screenplay. This film about the dark side of humanity is well-made and a winner. But, that being said; there really doesn't seem to be a lot of socially redeeming value to the content of the film. Is this the purpose of our cinema? To produce depressing, abnormally psychotic films that fascinate audiences. I guess so; it made a lot of money. And after all, isn't that all that really counts in film making?",7,0,0,16 October 2018
Citizen Kane," A Top Ten Film of All Time
","This film is currently rated as being in the 600s of popularity among film viewers. This says quite a bit about the general illiteracy of the American filmgoer. This is easily one of the top ten films of all time; and without any possible contradiction, it certainly belongs in every critic's top 100 films. Any critic who doesn't have it in their top 100, would not be considered a real critic in my book. 
 Is it the best film of all time, as proposed by several critics? I don't think so, but it certainly is in that kind of company. The story of William Randolph Hearst (not Hurst, as one misinformed critic had written) is a tragedy on several levels. And yet, its life's illusions we all recall, we really don't know life at all (apologies to Joni Mitchell). The film is magnificently shot to perfection. Shots that had never been tried before on film were common in this one. 
 This unauthorized biography got Welles into a lot of hot water with Hearst, who tried to have the movie prevented from being completed or shown on several occasions. The dialogue is superb; the actors are letter-perfect, and the story is mesmerizing. What else could you want from a film?",10,1,1,19 July 2018
Monster," A Top Three Performance of All Time - Monster
","This biopic is based on a true story; an unbelievably tragic and true story. The performance of Charlize Theron is one of the top three performances I have ever seen by an actress. I have seen over 20,000 films. The direction is perfect; the production values are perfect. The script is hair-raising and tragic. And as terrible as this woman's crimes were, there was an excellent case for her not to get the death penalty. The film is mesmerizing from beginning to end. Each actor, Bruce Dern and Christina Ritchie are letter-perfect. The story is dark and depressing and makes most noir movies look like Disney films in comparison. Patty Jenkins has produced a film that reached heights that neither she, nor Charlize Theron will ever reach again. They will both make many more talented projects; but none will ever reach the height of this film.",9,1,1,17 November 2019
Passengers," Solid Sci-Fi - Passengers
","Buckle up, its going to be a bumpy ride. The three lead actors make this a very entertaining film, and one could even say the bartender steals the film. The film is well-directed, and the production values are impressive. The story about a colony going off into space on a trip that takes over 100 years is interesting, and even more interesting is when a malfunction causes one of the passengers to awake just a bit prematurely; about 90 years prematurely. After a year of agonizing, the passenger decides to wake a beautiful woman to keep him company; in essence, robbing her of her life on the future planet. I will not reveal the results of this desperate attempt to relieve loneliness. Suffice it to say there are complications. Great special effects and a solid story; can't ask for much more in sci-fi.",7,2,3,5 December 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," good try but no cigar; Curse of the Black Pearl is a Cheap Imitation
","Let us quickly review the actors in this film, Depp, Knightley, Bloom, Price and Rush; all of which have done much better work in previous films. In this film, however, a silly pirate movie about zombies that has no logic, science or sex, so must be attached somehow to the Disney fantasy world, is , at best, mediocre eye candy. Depp plays a bisexual pirate with effeminate traits, but serious sexual dysfunction; most likely caused by his alcoholism. Knightly was almost convincing, until she didn't have sex with Depp after an all night orgy of everything else. Bloom is still stuck in his Lord of the Rings Personna, and is the weakest actor in this group, Pryce has to play the 'father' role, and basically gets a hand job (which he eventually defeats) in this film, and Rush seems to have the best time of all, having fun playing a despicable pirate in charge of a literally skeleton crew. The film is sometimes funny in the beginning, bogs down in the middle, and is about a half hour or more too long. Strictly for children and teens high on cheap beer.",4,0,8,15 July 2019
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Top of the Line Comedy/Drama - Crazy, Stupid Love
","Delicate subject matter handled in an intelligent way is really not the trademark of most Hollywood films; however Crazy, Stupid Love transcends that problem in several ways. Divorce is one. How can you make divorce bearable; or even funny at times? This film finds a way. How should we handle our first disappointment with love? How much should we trust our children with adult relationships? How should we reconstruct ourselves after a divorce (or should we)?
One issue the film avoids, however, is how the children we lived with every day no longer live with us every day if you are a man (most likely). But it does tackle those difficult issues mentioned above. It also tackles making new relationships and the bar scene. It has one hilarious scene with Tomei as a teacher at a bar, and she NAILS it. I have been with a few of these teachers many years ago; and she got it right on the nose. Steve Carell is perfect in this film, as is the supporting cast. The script is as crisp as a late Autumn breeze. The film reinforces the idea that love is possible; but not easy. Love is not just for idiots; it can be for people of character as well.",9,1,2,21 November 2018
The Irishman," Beter Than Average Gangster Film. - The Irishman
","The Irishman is entertaining, but it is not a classic or great film. The script is very good, the direction is tight and the acting is first-rate. The film is too long. Some scenes are tool long. Deniro does not convince as an Irishman. Pesci is very good. Pacino gives it the old college try, but does not convince as an Irishman either. Jack Nicholson did a much better job as Hoffa in a previous version. THe film is fast-paced at times and drags at other times. I love DiNero, Pesci, Pacino, and Scorcese, but this film had no Irish sensiblitilits at all; it was a remake of THe Godfather, with Pesci in the role of Brando. Good try; no cigar.",6,3,4,23 March 2020
Spotlight," Deserved to win Best Picture
","Spotlight is a well-made film. It even contains one of my favorite actors, John Slattery of Madmen fame. He was perfectly cast for this film, since he was a native Bostoner. The issue of the Catholic Church consistently and constantly covering up child abuse by priests has been with us since the first Catholic school was established in the US. I went to a Catholic elementary school, and our priests were as clean as a whistle. But a lot of other schools and priests were not. That is why this film is so important. Keaton has more recent success (in addition to Birdman) and now his career is completely back on track. Highly Recommended",9,0,0,3 September 2018
500 Days of Summer," Top of the Line Coming of Age Film - 500 Days of Summer
","This is a very good film. The acting is superb, especially from Joseph Gordon Levit and Zooey Deschanel. The direction is very tight, and the script is the reason the film is rated an 8. It made me laugh out loud eight times. I have a rule of giving a star for each laugh, as long as the writing and acting are up to snuff. There are two hilarious sequences in the film. I loved the serious art house satires of Bergman films and the idolatry of The Graduate. I also like the sequence where several of the physical aspects of Summer that he liked, now annoy him to no end. That is so true in real life. What Joe needed to learn is that women are like buses; there'll be another one in fifteen minutes. Maybe not THE ONE, but at least a decent replacement chair for your broken lazyboy. This film is classified as a non- love story (or love story), but I see it more as a top of the line coming of age film. See it and enjoy, and better to have loved and lost etc.",8,0,0,19 December 2018
A Bridge Too Far," Better Than Average WW2 Film- A Bridge Too Far
","Like the battle itself in real life, the film A Bridge Too Far had mixed results. Most of the performances were either adequate or very good, but there were a few red herrings as well. Elliot Gould was terrible as an Airborne officer. He just doesnt have what it takes. I was in the Airborne in North Carolina and Gould played the role like a cartoon character. I hate actors who do that. Another completely unbelievable character in the film was Ryan O'Neal, who has about as much military bearing as Jack Benny. Some roles were well-acted, however, with James Caan in a standout performance, as well as the dependable Gene Hackman as a believable screaming eagle. Maxmillan Schell and Hardy Kruger were very good as Germans, and Liv Ullmann and Laurence Olivier were sound as well. Michael Caine and Anthony Hopkins, two of my favorite actors, seemed to get lost in the dialogue and storyline. Richard Attenborough, who is a consummate professional, was merely making this film to get funding for the highly successful Gandhi; a good parlay for him. The worst part of the film, however, was the music, by John Addison, who was the score writer for the happy-happy Tom Jones film. He is very good with light music, but this film is the antithesis of light music, and required a heavyweight musical score in the style of Elmer Bernstein or Maurice Jarre. Almost anyone in Hollywood could have done a better score. Still, for all its flaws, it is a highly watchable film, and better than the average fare for WW2.",6,0,1,10 September 2019
The Prestige," Magical, Mystical Tour - The Prestige
","Such films as The Illusionist, Houdini and The King of Masks and others have all done excellent jobs with the subject of magic. The Prestige deserves to be right up there with those classics. I love magic and films about them, and I was not disappointed in this one. The King of Masks is my favorite all time magic film. This film comes close; the performances are impeccable, the direction is on the nose, and the production values are first-rate. The screenplay is erudite, and should be appreciated by the intelligent viewer. The really great magician in this film is neither of the leading actors, however. It is Tesla, one of the greatest scientific minds of all time; hounded by the heinous Thomas Edison, a person we were taught to revere in school. It is only now, in the information age, that we have found out what a despicable person Edison really was. There is no relation to reality and the Spencer Tracy film about Edison. He was a criminal. But the film is about magic, not criminal acts, or even Tesla (although we surely could use a good film about him). If you have even a passing interest or appreciation of good magic, then this film is for you. Enjoy.",8,1,1,11 December 2018
Crash," Another Figgis Gem: Crash
","This is a second film by director Figgis that deals with the social complexities of LA. No one does it better. He takes the lives of a dozen people and connects the dots with stereotypes, class distinctions, race problems, parent-sibling problems, and even a few other minor social difficulties. He weaves these problems among the dozen or so people, similar to what he accomplished in American History X, also about social problems in a California city (Venice), without concentrating too much on any one individual character.
This ensemble-type effort has been done before in Hollywood by a handful of directors; some of them good; others bad. But it appears as if Figgis has it down to a science. His finished product is always polished, logical, and emotionally involving. Highly recommended.",8,1,1,18 November 2018
Black Mass," Better Than Average Hood Flick - Black Mass
","Johnny Depp gives the best performance of his life in this South Boston tale of crime and punishment. The life of Jimmy Bulger is a cautionary story, as is the demise of Connelly, the hood in South Boston politics who protects Bulger. Crime does not pay. There is nothing glorious being killed in prison. The acting, direction and cinematography are all first-rate",7,0,0,26 September 2019
Elf," Better Than Average XMAS film: Elf
","To start off, Elf is not in the same category as A Christmas Story or A Christmas Carol. It is not even as good as Miracle on 34th Street, which had much better acting and dialogue. That being said, for the current generation of moviegoers, who are easily satisfied with whatever is served up to them as long as it has great production values (and this film has), Elf will more than fill the bill. I am a big fan of Will Farrell, and he does a great job of containing himself (something difficult for him to do) and not running amok with sexual innuendo (something that is totally lacking in the film; and rightfully so). I thought the casting of Caan was odd, but the rest of the cast seem to be mailing it in, anyway. Who can share a scene with Will Farrell and survive? Good film for the kids around Xmas.",6,2,2,5 December 2018
Doctor Strange," Doctor Strange Operation is a Success
","Doctor Strange, one of the better efforts of the Marvel Movie-Makers, really delivers the goods. I am fairly tough on Superhero movies; there are only three recent ones I felt are high-quality: Wonder Woman, Iron Man, and Doctor Strange.
Cumberbatch does a great job, and is made for the role. You can see how comfortably he delivers his lines and mannerisms. The rest of the cast is good as well. The special effects are among the best ever created for a film; up there with Star Wars, The Matrix, and The Sound of Music (just kidding; wanted to get a cheap laugh from you). Looking forward to the sequel.",7,1,1,24 May 2018
Gone Baby Gone," Better Than Average Human Drama - Gone Baby Gone
","I have a love/hate relationship with Boston. My favorite cousin lives there, and my favorite aunt and uncle lived there before they passed away. I am a Yankee fan, and that, of course, qualifies me to hate Boston. I love Affleck and Damon in just about everything they do, but I never forget they are from Boston. One of my first girlfriends went to school there, and I visited her on the weekends and came to really like the city. Now, I live in China, and Boston is a faint memory. This film is well-made and directed. Affleck is a better director than actor. Casey Affleck is a much better actor than his older sibling. The storyline was a bit unbelievable, and the characters were a bit over the top, but in general, it was an interesting premise. I look forward to many good films directed by Ben.",6,1,1,5 April 2019
Watchmen," good try; no cigar (except for The Comedian) - Watchmen
","If you enjoy watching an old-fashioned double-feature with a cartoon, then this movie could have been for you. Except, the problem is, they put the double feature and the cartoon all together in one movie that runs three and a half hours. Ben-Hur, yes, Lawrence of Arabia, yes, Gandhi, yes. This kaka? no. The characters are interesting, especially Captain Blue Balls, who lives on Mars and is smarter than the termite-brains of earth. Unfortunately, he is sexually dysfunctional, which may make him the smartest man in the universe, but pretty much a useless fellow in the bedroom. All the other characters are dysfunctional as well; as they closely resemble DC comic characters (DC was run out of business by Marvel, who devastated them in a nuclear attack in 1960). These leftovers from the DC universe make the Marvel characters look good by comparison; and I hate Marvel superhero movies. After Superman, its all downhill for me. Thank goodness AI and singularity is coming soon to replace all this kaka of superheroes. The film is an endless parade of senseless violence with no resolution; and my observation is exactly the same as one of the characters portrayed in the film: Bernard, the comic book reader who wasted an hour on some silly, violent pirate fantasy and came to the conclusion 'This makes no sense' . Right you are, Bernard. And this film is in the same category. Kaka.",4,2,10,13 January 2019
The Alamo," Better Than Average Old West Story - The Alamo
","Well, at least this one is better than the John Wayne Alamo. And far more accurate than the Disney version in Davy Crockett. It is a bit broadly acted, but then again, that might reflect the big Texan personalities of the time. The action sequences are excellent, and it appears to be fairly historically correct. Sam Houston had a chance to rescue this group, but knew it was a trap by Santa Anna. The film was better than most Westerns, but not really a classic. I would still recommend it for the average viewer.",6,3,3,22 November 2018
Wanted," Better Than Transformers or Kill Bill - Wanted
","This film has some of the best special effects ever. It is action-packed and has tremendous production values. The story is ridiculous, of course, but then again, all these films (transformers, kill bill and every other tarantino film ever made) are all ridiculous, but fun to watch. This film is even more fun to watch. There is no acting per se, but there never is in films like these. The movie is just great eye candy; no doubt about it. You will be entertained; and if it takes an hour and a half of relentless violence and gore wrapped around totally illogical situations, then it is what it is. Just go with the flow.",6,4,8,18 October 2019
Dallas Buyers Club," Dallas Buyers Club - Philadelphia Texas Style
","First of all, I was very impressed by the acting job done by Matt McConoughey. I had previously thought of him as a lightweight melodramatic actor. He has proved me wrong. He can handle the heavy load. His performance was worthy of an Oscar, and it was rightfully given to him. The screenplay was riveting because it showed the AMA and FDA for what they really are; thieves and profiteers. The medical community in the US would rather see thousands of people suffer and die rather than have them get medication from another country that could actually help them. An FDA approved drug has all the validity of a film that is condemned by the Catholic Church because of adult content, like Midnight Cowboy. Obviously, the Church had no clue about quality of film; it was just concerned with the moral issues. The same is true for the FDA and AMA. They are not concerned about effectiveness; only approval of American drug companies. This film is on par with Philadelphia, and in some instances, superior to it. A film not to be missed.",9,0,0,9 May 2020
American History X," An American Classic: American History X
","This snapshot of Venice, California, a racially tense seaside city, is both accurate and frightening. The irrational response of a repressed middle class white family to the indifference of an overly permissive government (since corrected since the election of President Trump) that allow American tax dollars to be spent on undocumented immigrants is highlighted in a speech within the film. Aside from the political aspect, the pure visceral energy of the film's violence and frustration from all races comes directly to the consciousness of the viewer. All forms of extremism are shown to be self-defeating. A bravura performance by both Ed Norton and Ed Furlong. An American classic.",9,3,3,16 November 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A Top 100 Film of All Time
","I write a yearly book for listing 2000 of the best films of all time at Amazon. This film not only makes my top 2000, it makes my top 100, which is very difficult to do. And I do not usually give out tens for ratings as well. A ten represents a perfect film, which this is. Films like Cinema Paradiso, Lawrence of Arabia, Lost Horizon, and The Producers get 10s. This is a comedy as good as The Producers.
The actors in this film really stay in character, and no one hams it up. Brody came close, but his role called for someone over the top. Everyone else was extremely professional and low-key. It's the best thing that Goldblum has ever done. And several of the cameos are absolutely first-rate. This is a film not to be missed by any serious filmgoer. Fiennes deserved an Oscar for this role.Dr. Arthur H Tafero

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," King of the Stereotypes
","This is the best film Quinton Tarrantino and Leonardo DiCaprio have ever done. It is also the best work that Brad Pitt has ever done. That being said, Tarrantino has never really made a legitimate film; but this is the closest he has come. He is getting better. It is a good period piece. DiCaprio can never be a macho actor even though he has tried a dozen times to do do. Pitt, on the other hand, has no problem handling the macho role. To his credit, DiCaprio does have a few good scenes (his missing lines rage and his bad guy satire); however, he gets bogged down in his other scenes. Pitt is consistently good in every scene he is in and will win the Academy Award this year for Best Supporting Actor. Amusingly enough, because the Academy outrageously omitted Adam Sandler for Uncut Gems from the nominations, Pitt could have won Best Actor in the category had he been nominated. But now that award will probably go to Phoenix for Joker. A wise decision to have him nominated for Best Supporting Actor. This film will not win Best Movie of the Year; that honor will go to 1917, which is already a classic. Best Director and Cinematography will also go to 1917. Tarrantino is getting better though.",5,2,6,9 February 2020
Gone Girl," Better Than Average Mystery - Gone Girl
","Rosemund Pike gives a Joan Crawford-type performance in this mystery thriller also starring Ben Affleck. But make no mistake; Pike steals the film away from Affleck with the greatest of ease. Although not in the same category as Meryl Streep as an actress (she just does not have the sincere believability that Streep has). Pike is a formidable actress. She is good-looking (better looking than Crawford or Streep), sexier than Crawford or Streep, but not as genuine or believable as Crawford or Streep. Crawford was a great actress purely based on her iron will which was clearly present on her screen persona; Pike has that commodity in common with Crawford. Crawford and Pike are both chilling and threatening; Streep is not. We as an audience believe that Streep is vulnerable, but would scoff at the idea that either Crawford or Pike had even the remotest chance of being vulnerable. And that is what separates Pike from other actresses of this era. She is incapable of being vulnerable. No one would believe for a second that she could be vulnerable. It would be like being asked to believe John Wayne in a lead role of a gay-oriented film is vulnerable. I've seen all of Pike's films and am continuously fascinated with her persona, even though she gives exactly the same performance time after time.(just like John Wayne). And ultimately, she is a very bankable star.",6,0,2,16 September 2019
Mr. Nobody," Boyhood on Crack; Mr. Nobody
","This film is Boyhood on Crack and with an enormous helping of quantum physics and algorithms thrown in just for good measure. It is either one of the greatest films of all time, or (if you judge the box office which is lower than any film in history except Heaven's Gate), one of the worst films of all time. The likely truth is that it is somewhere in the middle, so I gave it a 6 (one extra star for originality). The visuals are quite stunning and reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The emotional content is similar to Boyhood, and the sensual aspect of the perfect brother and sister twins is not related to any film I know of. This film is different, if nothing else. I guarantee you that you have seen nothing like it before. I can see why it didn't make any money. Most people are too ignorant to understand what the film is about; don't understand quantum physics and algorithms, and have difficulty in making a leap in imagination. Too bad for them.",6,0,1,27 November 2018
The Number 23," $23; the amount of money this made at the Box Office - 23
","Jim Carrey is a fine comedian. He should stick to comedy; he is not a good dramatic actor. He has never had one single dramatic role that was believable to the general public or critics. Edgy comedy, quirky comedy, dark comedy, yes, he can get away with just about all of those. But a serious dramatic psychological drama? No; sorry, no sale. Stick to what you are good at. Of course, now he is too old to be doing physical comedy; his trademark. By the way, 23 is a prime number, and he was a member of the prime time players. Also, Don Mattingly, Michael Jordan and Lebron James all have 23 as their jersey number. But none of them are murderers. This film looked like a Carrey home movie rather than a Hollywood production. The production values were amateurish. I couldnt decide between a 2 or a 3 (23). So, since I am a fan of his comedy, I gave him a 3.",3,1,3,8 May 2019
Grudge Match," Better Than Average Rocky or Recent DiNero
","I like both of these actors; they seldom, if ever, appear in films together. DiNero as an Irishman is a bit of stretch as a character, but he is a consummate actor, so he can get away with it. Stallone does his Rocky, and DiNero does his LaMotta; nobody watching will remember the name of either's character from this film three days from when they see it. I will just remember Rocky and Lamotta, or Stallone and DiNero. The film was better than I had hoped. It could have been terrible six different ways, but the writer and director kept the decent storyline in tact. Stallone was still Rocky with another name, and DiNero was still Lamotta with another name. In a real fight, I believe Stallone would rock DiNero in just a few minutes.",6,0,0,28 June 2019
Wimbledon," Double Fault: Wimbledon
","It is always a mistake to have guest stars in films who are better looking and much sexier than the leading lady. I am, of course, talking about Ms Dunst. Best known for her role as Spiderman's girlfriend, Ms Dunst is just not sexy enough for film. She is not all that good looking, either. Chris Evert is FAR sexier, and MUCH better looking. And why was Mr. McEnroe so calm; that's not his real personality. The real problem with the film was trying to find a Brit to play a Wimbledon finalist. There hasn't been one since Fred Perry in the 1930s lol. This was an unintentionally funny film with Dunst playing a Chris Evert wannabe, and Mr. Neill playing her father. Mr. Neill is better off going back to Jurassic Park; this role is not for him. I always thought The All-American, starring Tony Curtis was the worst sports film ever made, but at least Tony had talent for other films and looked like a pretty good touch football player. Dunst couldn't beat Ms. Evert's father in Fort Lauderdale. If she could act, we could overlook her poor tennis, but her acting is weaker than her serve.

1917," 1917 - One of the Best WW1 FIlms of All Time
","You had Wings as the first great WW1, and it won the first Academy Award for Best Film. And two years later, you had All Quiet on the Western Front, an interesting film based on the perspective of German soldiers. Both of those films richly deserved the award, but you have really not had a great WW2 film since 1930-31. Of course, there was Kubrick's Kirk Douglas anti-war film on WW1, Paths of Glory, but that does not match the scope of this film; a masterpiece of direction and execution of one continuous shot. Almost two hours of perfect movie-making. The acting is superb and the production values and music are letter-perfect. You couldn't make a better film.

Its just short of The Godfather 1 and 2, but just as good as Goodfellas, Casino, and one or two others. Pacino is right on and this is Depp's best film of his career. I have panned him several times, but not for this performance; its very good. The supporting cast is outstanding; especially Kirby and the wife of Brasco.

Into the Wild," Above-Average Road Movie
","An intelligent, but socially dysfunctional, white boy, who comes from a privileged family, does not plan his road trip very well and becomes a victim of nature. Nature should never be underestimated or minimized in any way in road trips of this kind. The hippie message of the film is quite clear, and brought back fond memories of my youth. It also brought back recollections of mistakes that were made during that era as well by us who dropped out and tuned in.
Being a tramp is not a great adventure. Ask any of the thousands of families who lost loved ones during the Great Depression (see Grapes of Wrath). Usually, being a tramp is a gradual decline into oblivion. Nature is not free. There is a price to be paid for everything in life. Burning money is not symbolic; it is just plain stupid. There are millions on the earth who would love to have that money so they could eat a good meal. This young man's life was tragic, but there was a lesson to be learned from it. People born of parents who are not privileged would never attempt anything like this. But his final words were too late to save him; happiness is only worthwhile if it is shared.",6,1,2,24 November 2018
Avatar," Case for Best Sci-Fi Pic Ever - Avatar
","Yes, The Day the Earth Stood Still (original) is still probably champ, but this film gives it a run for its money. I had thought James Cameron to be an egotistical meglomaniac when I saw him at the Academy Award ceremonies for Titantic, but I have changed my mind after Avatar. Cameron is a very good writer and director. His sets, special effects, makeup and production values for Avatar are unsurpassed. The acting crew, led by buffed-up Gary Sinese as an all-time heavy is more than competent. Sigorney Weaver, who does her impression of Margaret Mead, the famous anthropologist, does a very credible job as well. The sets are magnificent. As Issac Asimov once said, you can only write good science-fiction if you are able to create a believable environment that surrounds your story. Well, Cameron accomplished that; to his credit. Philosophically, however, the film is much deeper than the eye candy that we behold for almost two hours. Ultimately, this film is a tragedy or triumph, depending on your life view. Man vs. Science and Nature is an eternal struggle. It appears as if Nature wins this one, but there is plenty of precedent for Nature getting clobbered by Science and Man in the history of Mankind. The American Indian, who should have slaughtered the first settlers of the American continent made a fatal mistake and allowed them to live alongside them. Ultimately, these invaders destroyed the American Indian and its culture. The same could be said for ancient man; evolution generally wipes out any previous edition that has basic flaws. But is that nature or science?
There were sequences in the film that were reminiscent of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, The Last Samurai, Star Wars, Mutiny on the Bounty, and Full Metal Jacket. An animated film, Forbidden Planet, also came to mind. The Vietnam War (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Go Tell the Spartans) also had parallels. The Iraq occupation has parallels. Haleburton, anyone? There are political considerations. Conservative hard-liners might favor the colonists. Liberals would naturally tend to favor the natives. But Nature has no political alliance. Nature overcomes all political and religious beliefs. There is no need to go any further than Deep Impact to realize that scenario (the bad one, not the lucky one). Or Sunshine (once again, bad scenario, not the lucky one). Science and man are always destined to lose to nature the vast majority of times. Occasionally, science and man wins, but those wins are only temporary. Nature always wins in the end.",9,2,4,12 January 2019
The Legend of 1900," One of the Top 100 FIlms of All Time - 1900
","The Legend of 1900 is a special film; it is on my top 100 films of all time, and that is not easy to be listed on. It is the second best film project ever completed by the team of director Tornatore and film score creator, Morricone. It is second only to Cinema Paradiso, the greatest Italian classic film of all time. The lead actors and production values are topnotch and the script is absolutely impeccable.
The story of a baby born and abandoned on top of a piano of a luxury liner on New Year's Day of 1900 is fascinating. He is raised on the ship by a 5th Deck (men who shoveled coal for the liner's energy) seaman for eight years, and then after the seaman's unfortunate demise, lives on his own, in the bowels of the ship. And there is more thing about him
He is the greatest piano player who ever lived.
He is a master of the piano by age eight; and entertains the entire crew and passenger categories, from the poorest to the richest. He becomes part of the luxury liner band and has several adventures during the numerous crossings of the ship. He even meets a beautiful girl, but does not pursue their relationship off the ship after she departs. The sea is his mistress; and he never abandons her.
The primary motifs of this film are the piano and the ocean, as well as a good friend who blows a pretty mean horn. However, the opening motif, which is repeated a few times in various crossings, is also important. There is always one person, who in the early morning mist, while approaching New York Harbor, sees the Statue of Liberty for the first time, like an angel parting the clouds of upcoming democracy. 'AMERICA!' the excited immigrant yells, and a roar goes up from the large crowd of immigrants on the deck as everyone faces the statue and the ship enters the impressive harbor of New York City.
These scenes are accompanied by outstanding music, as are several other scenes in this classic film. As the protagonist explains, all things have a beginning and end, and being confined to a small piece of land for him would have been a premature end to his existence. So he opts to live and die on the sea. Both the sea and the piano are eternal and unlimited in scope. This film is a must-see for any serious film buff.",9,1,2,20 November 2018
The Great Raid," Better Than Average War Film - The Great Raid
","Ben Bratt is a television actor who had a few minor roles in major films. He is not strong enough to carry a lead role on the big screen. The supporting cast, however, is very strong, as is the writing and direction of the film. The archival material is first-rate. The production values and subplots for the rescue of these men is also impeccable. So this is a much better film about WW 2 than most other films made after 1950. The problem with most WW 2 films is authenticity and the air of uncertainty or gloom. We get some of that in this film, but hardly any in the vast majority of other WW 2 films made after 1950. Saving Private Ryan has that gloom, as does Bridge Over the River Kwai and Stalag 17. This film is in that tradition. Highly recommended for a much better insight to the war in the Pacific.",8,1,1,8 January 2019
The Disaster Artist," Good Try at Satire - The Disaster Artist
","James Franco is like a major league baseball slugger who is in a slump. Most of the time he strikes out; but occasionally, he hits a long one. I have seen him do good work, and, at other times, waste his talent. This film, however, is a courageous attempt at satire that almost works. This is 'The Producers' without the talented cast and scriptwriters. However, it is not fair to compare it to one of the best comedies of all time, because it is nowhere nearly as good.
It is not as startling as a Borat movie; who is the king of satire in the 21st century (along with the Coen Brothers). Let's just give this effort what it deserves; a thumbs up for a very good try, and an amusing turn for Franco as a versatile actor. For someone obsessed with James Dean, Franco is relatively reserved most of the time. I think the director in the beginning of the film hit the nail on the head, when she said people just don't go for the 'poor puppy dog' acting approach that Franco often falls back upon. This satire of a rich filmmaker almost totally bereft of any acting talent making a film that makes no sense at all is fairly amusing, however, the hollow ending detracts from the film's success. A better ending would have been suicide. There is no way this could become a cult film because of the pat ending. Anyway, good try James.",6,0,0,4 July 2020
Enemy at the Gates," The Best War Film of All Time - Enemy at the Gate
","Saving Private Ryan had been my favorite war film of all time. It has been replaced by this film. That was not a very easy task to complete, but the director, actors, and production crew of this film accomplished the impossible; surpassing the bruatlity of D-Day and the American invasion of Normandy as seen in Private Ryan, the previous champion of outstanding beginning sequences for a war film.
The opening sequences of Enemy at the Gate are far more brutal than Saving Private Ryan, and the visceral audacity of giving one soldier a rifle and a second soldier instructions to pick it up after the first soldier is dead is far beyond the call of duty of the American soldiers in Private Ryan, where each soldier was well-armed. The characterizations in the film are unforgettable, and the actors involved will never be able to surpass these roles in their entire acting careers. The story is first-rate, and the supporting cast is impeccable. The music by James Horner is one of his best scores as well. And I loved Hoskins as Khurshchev. I will always consider Saving Private Ryan one of my top 100 films of all time because of its incomparable mother at home scene losing so many sons in the same war, but for action sequences, suspense, and a study in survival, it is surpassed by Enemy at the Gate. A film not to be missed.",9,1,1,21 March 2019
A Beautiful Mind," Better Than Average Genius Movie: A Beautiful MindI
","I love math, and I love intelligent films about intelligent people who do intelligent things. But I don't like watching someone suffer on film. The reason I didn't give this film a higher rating was the excessive amount of time and excessive number of scenes depicting John Nash's obvious disabilities. OK , we get it; the guy is sick and suffers schizoid and paranoid delusions. So did my mother, but I tended to overlook her problems because of her wonderful outstanding qualities. They should have done the same in this film. The scenes depicting Nash's talents and accomplishments were far more inspirational than the cheesy attempts to include us in his delusions. We know he is delusional after the first few scenes with the bogeyman from the CIA or NSA. I understand these scenes are necessary to show his pain and difficulty with this afflictions, but there is no need to hammer it with extra scenes that prevent us from discovering all of the wonderful game theories and how they were discovered by Nash. Still a very impressive film, however.",7,1,1,29 November 2018
The Departed," Top-Notch Gangster Film - The Departed
","Martin Scorcese is a Hollywood legend. He knows New York City. He knows Boston, and he knows gangsters. The script is outrageously good. The photography is outstanding. Everything in the movie was impeccable except the casting. And no, I am not going to say Pacino should have had Nicholson's role. Jack was just fine. I just think that the two roles of the leading men should have been switched. Damon is a tougher guy than Dicaprio. And Wahlberg is tougher than both of them; but he was cast perfectly. Dicaprio in a fight with Wahlberg? I don't think so. Dicaprio as a tough guy? Sorry, I'm not buying. Didnt buy him in Gangs in New York as a tough guy, either. Just like I never bought Mongomery Clift as a tough guy in From Here to Eternity or in The Young Lions. Seeing Dicaprio win a fight with anyone in a film gives me the same feeling as when I saw Clift win a fight with John Wayne in a Western. It just didnt convince my senses. Other than the switch in the lead roles, the film is almost perfect. (except for the love scenes with Dicaprio, which pretty much fall into the same category as the fight scenes. Please. Choosing Dicaprio over Damon. LOL. It was like watching Lily Tomlin in a love scene with John Travolta. Great film, though.",8,1,2,21 October 2018
Steve Jobs," Better Than Average Biopic - Steve Jobs
","Peter Boyle is one of the best directors in the business; and he does not disappoint with this effort. Fassbinder is an excellent lead actor and is very convincing as Steve Jobs. I now know why very little of my Microsoft hardware and software does not work with my MacBook Air computer. It appears as if Steve Jobs was brilliant in business, but a jerk in his personal life. But then again, so is about half the population of the US; the latter part that is. People in glass houses, etc, etc. The pacing of this film was frantic and the production values first-rate. The supporting cast was very good, and Jeff Daniels, in particular, appeared to be just a bit brighter than he was in Dumb and Dumber. Now that is really range. A good introspective film.",7,0,1,3 January 2019
Joker," Better Than Average Super-Villain Film - Joker
","To be fair, Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in this film. The dark, depressing mood is carefully cultivated by the director and cinematographer, who also do commendable work. However, the script suffers from another case of out-of-perioditis. This character and Batman belong in the 1930s, and screenwriters, directors and producers seem to make the same mistake over and over again by trying to put Batman and the Joker in the seventies or even a more modern era. The phony poor people killing the rich was far more likely to occur during the Depression of the 30s rather than the post WW2 era. I liked the Taxi Driver and King of Comedy tributes to DeNiro, But the film played more like Death Wish with the Getz killings copied almost identically to the real event. By the way, most rich people don't take the subways; they take taxis. Nice eye candy though. I hope Phoenix gets the Award, now that Sandler has been disrespected by the Academy by not even getting nominated for Uncut Gems.",6,1,4,30 January 2020
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Satire of CNN and MSNBC Hits the Spot
","Doing stupid comedy is not as easy as it seems. Will Ferrell proves that he is one of the best in the business at getting these tough roles done. He is Chevy Chase with a heart and a brain. The supporting cast of this farce is outstanding, and the cameos are pretty funny: I enjoyed Jack Black as a biker who loves dogs, Tim Robbins as a ruthless gang leader, and Ben Stiller as a crazed Hispanic (I really didnt buy him as a Hispanic, but he was funny, anyway). This film had tons of comedic talent, and most of it was well-used; except for Steve Carell. Not buying Steve as a complete idiot; he has too much native intelligence and sensitivity to be the idiot he tried to portray. Other than that faux pax, the film is pretty funny. Even Christina Applegate stretches her abilities and gets the role done. A must-see comedy.",7,0,0,5 October 2018
Inception," Good Idea; great special effects, but ultimately disappointing
","Inception is a great concept for a film. And the special effects in it are among the best ever created for any film. But special effects alone cannot compensate for weaknesses in a plot or story. And there are several weaknesses in the plot and story. One is the believability that corporations are evil entities striving to achieve world dominance and stealing anything they can from the competition. While this might be true of one or two minor companies, major multinationals could never afford the bad PR associated with such actions; and so it is not within the realm of believability for over 99% of the multinationals out there. DiCaprio is not bad, and the supporting cast gives it the college try, but no cigar from the classic film school. You have to have a believable story to match your great special effects and a good idea.",5,2,7,16 October 2018
Lord of War," The Best Film on Arms Sales Ever Made
","This is the best film Nicolas Cage has ever made. It is in my top 100 films of all time; and it is not easy to get on that list. The acting, direction, production values, and writing for this film are top of the line. There is not one flaw in the film. I can count on two hands the films I have give ratings of 10; it is not a rating I give often. Every scene is perfectly shot. Every sequence is more astounding than the next. Every character is eminently believable. America loves its guns. It makes, uses and distributes more guns in the world than the next TWENTY countries combined. Americans love their guns more than their children; and this is not an exaggeration. When faced with protecting their children or the second amendment to protect gun owners, Americans consistently take action for the latter. They can say they love their children more than their guns, but their actions prove otherwise. Of course, there are millions of Americans who do love their children more than guns (and I am one of them), but it would appear as if they are in the minority, OR the gun lobby and forces that we see at work in this film are far more powerful than the majority of Americans who live in the country. Even the character portrayed by Cage throws away a toy gun that his son has. At some level, he does not want his son to be like him. Our children are bombarded with toy guns from toddler age, TV gun violence, movie gun violence, and actual gun use in communities until guns become second nature to them. I was ecstatic when I qualified for Expert in Basic Training during the Vietnam War. I loved going to the rifle range because I was very good at it. I had been conditioned to feel that way from the time I was a small child and had my Hopalong Cassidy six-shooters in my side holsters. After the Vietnam War, I knew better. And forty years after the Vietnam War, I still know better. Guns are instruments of death. My favorite line in the film is when a little girl who is an amputee asks the white man from the US 'Will my arm grow back again?' No, it won't. It would be nice if we protected children instead of guns.",9,0,0,12 October 2018
Parasite," Best Korean Film of All Time - Parasite
","This is the best Korean film of all time. Now that is not really saying much, as Korean films generally finish fourth in a competition with Chinese, Japanese and Indian films in Asia. But if this film is any indication, Korea may be on the cusp of jumping over one of their competitors in Asia. This black comedy has the feel of Coen Brothers special, though not quite as pithy or broad. There is more character development here than in most Coen films (with the exception of Fargo). Joon-Ho does a great job of writing and directing and brings his vision home to roost without any apparent flaws. Each actor in the film does a very nice job, with the daughter of the hustler family (I love good hustler films) doing an outstanding turn. I look forward to Joon-Ho's next project.",8,10,14,31 January 2020
The Water Diviner," Better Than Average WW1 Tale - The Water Diviner
","This film is not as good as some WW1 classics such as 1918, Gallipoli, or Paths of Glory, but it certainly places fourth on that short list. This is a very nice effort by Russell Crowe, with a lot of help from a talented supporting cast and a very interesting script. The one thing about this film I found interesting was the treatment of Turkey and the Turks in WW 1. No other Hollywood film has shown them in such a positive light. Lawrence of Arabia merely showed them in a stereotypical way (they were the BAD guys) and other films have depicted the Turks as just background for WW1 topical films. This is the first film that delves into WW from the Turkish standpoint. I did not buy the romantic aspect of the film, but that was a minor glitch. The primary story is overwhelming enough to overcome that small bump in the road.",7,0,1,25 May 2020
The Queen," The Queen Deserved Best Actress
","The Queen is a perfect performance by Helen Mirren. No one could have done better, and very few could have done as well. The direction and production values of the film are impeccable, and the script is right on the money. Michael Sheen as Tony Blair is very good as well. There was not a dull moment in the entire film about the ambivalence of the royal family toward Diana. The public loved her far more than her cheating husband, Charles. And the disdain by Prince Philip and the Queen only added to the fuel against the monarchy in England. It was only through the efforts of Tony Blair and the eventual coming to her senses of Queen Elizabeth that the monarchy did not suffer further damage. This is a performance that one should not miss. How ironic that a woman who loved animals so much, actually enjoyed hunting them down and killing them as well.",8,0,1,20 November 2018
The Woman in Black," All Atmosphere; No Substance
","Scary movies are supposed to be scary; this one is not. There are more holes in this story than a large portion of Swiss cheese. It does get an A for production values, however. Harry Potter gives us his best efforts, but he cannot possibly escape his child personna with his average acting ability. Three children suddenly commit suicide and that is the basis for beginning this tedius, (and sometimes boring) tale of supposed horror. I have had haircuts that were more horrible than this film.
The supporting cast is stilted and pretentious. Some of the scenes are stilted and pretentious as well. It was a good try at Gothic horror, but it clearly fails to deliver the goods. Harry is supposed to be a failing lawyer. He also has trouble paying his bills with the not so subtle scene of his bills in his suitcase. The film reminded me of a much more expensive version of The Blair Witch Project; another piece of contentious kaka, that would possibly only scare seven-year-olds; just like this one. As for an adult movie-goer, you would be well-advised to see Snow White and the Seven Dwarves as a rental rather than this tedius attempt at horror. 'That was a scary one, eh kids?' (my apologies to Joe Flaherty).",4,1,1,10 March 2019
Win Win," Giamatti scores another takedown
","Doesnt Paul Giamatti ever get tired of selecting good scripts, roles, and films? I have seen almost every film he has made, and I cannot remember one bad one in the substatial lot. Win, Win is another in his long line of successes. With a fine supporting cast, including Bobby Cannavale, who made his bones in 'Boardwalk Empire', and Amy Ryan, who is completely believable as a Jersey girl (I have known a few), and especially newcomer Alex Shaffer, who has great potential. This film has it all, starts slowly, and then gradually grabs you in emotoionally until the conclusion. Beautifully conceived, written with authenticity, and acted to perfection by a good cast. Who could ask for more?",8,0,0,7 March 2019
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Very Good Biopic - Elizabeth: The Golden Age
","Clive Owen, as Walter Raleigh, almost steals this film away from Cate Blanchett, who plays Queen Elizabeth. His screen persona is quite impressive. That is not to say that Blanchett was not as equally impressive. Even Geoffrey Rush was good, despite having to play an icy, calculating court official. The cinematography of this movie is outstanding, as are all the production values, and the direction of Shakar Kapur is impeccable. The entire production was first-rate and well-deserving of the several awards it won. The story of Elizabeth is fascinating, as is the story of Raleigh as well. Highly recommended,",8,0,0,7 December 2018
Lucy," Better Than Average Sci-Fi - Lucy
","Before viewing this film, I had a rather low opinion of Scarlett Johanson as an actress. Also, for the first ten minutes of the film, I was not really impressed with her performance because I figured she was a low-life playing a low-life in a film; not exactly a stretch. Then I was surprised by her range and acting ability. My opinion of her has changed radically. Morgan Freeman is always good; and he is good in this film as well. The story of a street girl who becomes the smartest person on the planet is entertaining, and the production values, although a bit violent, are first-rate. Some of the characters (like the Asian drug dealers) are stereotypes and cartoonish, but we forgive that because the general story line is very intelligent. Surprising to see someone resurrect their career with such an outlandish film.",6,2,3,5 April 2019
Midway," Much Better Than Average WW 2 film - Midway 2019
","This film comes about 40 years after the original made in the late 1970s, which obviously suffered from far less dramatic special effects. In addition to much better special effects, the lead actors other than Henry Fonda from the original, all do a better job in this one. The actor portraying Flyer Best does a pretty good job of hamming it up and projecting just about every stereotype you have ever seen in a WW 2 flyboy film. However, despite this over the top approach, the carefully edited and directed film is superior to the original in those areas as well. One criticism I did have about the storyline however, was the Doolittle sequence, which really only skimmed the surface of what could have been a far more meaningful few scenes depicting how the Chinese got him out of the country and the terrible losses they suffered under the Japanese, whom they hate to this day. This is precisely why the Chinese investors of this film will turn a very nice profit. Showing the film all over China to people who still hate the Japanese is money in the bank. I predict the film will be a big hit in China, and one of the biggest grossers of the year in China as well.",7,0,2,10 November 2019
Deadpool," Unintentionally Hilarious KAKA - Deadpool
","This film will be great fodder for MST3000. It has great special effects, and will make you laugh because the acting is almost as bad as the dialogue. The film has no socially redeeming value, is anti-intellectual, anti-logical, anti-science, anti-math and anti-child. Other than that, the film is fine for arrested development IQs under 80. The film has nothing to do with Spiderman, Stan Lee, or the Marvel comics of the early 60s. It has everything to do with mindless violence that totters on the hilarious, dialogue that must have been written in the John during a lunch break, and no actors or directors. The editing is pretty good, however. So if you want to watch a film with good special effects and editing, but absolutely nothing else of any consequence, than this film is for you. If you want a story or acting, I would suggest you go to ANY other film ANYWHERE else. These Quintin Tarrantino wannabes really good me a good laugh. By the way, there is scientific proof that the lead actor is completely brainless at the conclusion of the film. An antagonist (bad guy for those who watch the film), drills a bolt inside the temple of our hero, which, if he had a brain, would have killed him instantly, but since there is nothing but absolute air between his ears, it will merely result in a nasty cut that will heal in about a week. True KAKA.",1,4,5,21 September 2019
Cloud Atlas," Better Than Average Soap - Cloud Atlas
","As a person who is sometimes characterized as egocentric, pretentious, and overblown, I can commiserate with the producer and actors of this film. Cloud Atlas is all these things and more. It is a courageous attempt at something different, but in the end, it all about people and their difficulties in life. Six disparate stories that have some similar parallels , but not the mystic parallels desired by the writers. In reality these are six stories that could not hold up for the necessary 90 minutes individually for a screenplay, so the concept of putting them in an ensemble with talented actors was actually a brilliant stroke of creativity. Of the six stories, the Korean woman in the future is, by far, the most interesting of the lot. The Halle Berry reporter story just doesn't seem to connect (although I love her, personally). Seeing Tom Hanks in red hair was amusing, however. He reminded me of a virile Red Skelton. The slave story was mildly interesting, but not as interesting as 12 Years a Slave. The old man trying to escape the old folk's home was amusing as well, but only strong enough for a 30 minute sitcom episode. The gay musician episode was quite well done in the early going, but unfortunately gradually went downhill after the first ten minutes. And the sixth component was so unmemorable, that I cannot remember it at all. All in all, a good college try by the cast and the director and advice to the writers to stick to 30 minute formats for their screenplays. Doona Bae steals this film.",6,0,0,5 July 2020
Joy," Great Business Flick: Joy
","If you liked Wall Street, and There Will Be Blood, you will probably like this film as well. Jennifer Lawrence's characterization is compelling; however, her family is not. Her best friend is dependable, but not really anyone else in her family except her daughter. Her father, Robert De Niro, is in a role similar to the one he played in Being Flynn, a dysfunctional father seeking a place to stay with an offspring. He is not as good in this film as he was in Being Flynn. The rest of the cast is fine, but it is really not the family scenes that drive this movie; it is the business sequences. The film is like a stock market chart that starts rising gradually, and then suddenly spikes wildly up and down and then back up again. All of these spikes are caused by business-related episodes, some of which are absolutely stunning, and well done by the director. The film bogs down in the family scenes, and spikes in the business scenes. Clearly, the story yearns to be more of a business film than a dysfunctional family film. Luckily, the writer came to this same conclusion and we get a substantial number of good business scenes. Several of the family characterizations are minimal, at best, and are not as deeply explored as Joy. But this is probably a good thing, as the rest of the family is just not as interesting as Joy. A good film to be enjoyed more for its business revelations than insights on how to deal with a dysfunctional family.",7,0,0,7 December 2018

Spike Jonze is a talented man. The dialogue is electric at times.

","I just viewed Contact for the second time. I had retracted my views on this film as a top 2000 film of all time because of an honest objection by one of my readers who disagreed with my assertion in the book. I took it out of the next edition; that was a mistake. I put it back in for the next several years' edition of 2000 of the Best Films of All Time. I was right the first time. It is a great film and does address several key questions: Is There a God? If There Isn't a God, then should we trust Science? Should we trust the Private Sector over our governments, God, and the Military-Industrial Complex? No one really knows the answers to these questions; we can only give our best guess; and that guess would be based on faith. Faith in science or faith in God? Maybe faith in both. There may not be much difference in any of these faiths. Everyone believes in something. I believe I'm going to have another gin and tonic.",8,0,1,11 December 2018
Up in the Air," Reitman's and Clooney's Best Work - Up in the Air
","This film has some serious insights to life. It poses questions such as why get married? That you have a better chance of winning at the Blackjack tables in Vegas than having a successful marriage. Is it better to be alone or have a companion in life? We complain in both situations. And when it comes to jobs, it really hits the nail on the head. Why do we work? For money, or because we are doing what we love? Are we following our bliss? This is the first film that I have ever seen Clooney show a vulnerable side; and that is why it is his best work. The film is intelligently written and expects the audience to take a deep philosophial breath before coming to a decision on what life's choices might be. A top film.",8,1,1,24 March 2019
V for Vendetta," Entertaining Revolution - V for Vendetta
","Dwight Eisenhower warned us of the military-industrial complex, and George Orwell warned us of Big Brother, Terry Gilliam illustrated full bureaucratic control of our lives in Brazil (and later with The Zero Theorem), and V for Vendetta reminds us that every now and then, we need a revolution. Recent revolutions in the world include the American Revolution, the French Revolution, The Russian Revolution, and the Chinese Revolution. One could even say in 1989, there was an Anti-USSR Revolution. The producers and directors of this film were most likely influenced by Lech Welesa and Solidarity with its revolt against the USSR. It is ironic that countries that were created by revolutions eventually become countries that need them again.
England has not really had one of these revolutions; so the premise of the film is interesting. As a film, standing on cinematic standards alone, it is entertaining, uneven, has problems with pacing, but has strong character development, a good story, and excellent production values. The cast is excellent as well. Natalie Portman is superb, as is John Hurt. Today, we obviously have Anonymous as a new revolutionary force in the world order. How effective they are is a matter of opinion and conjecture. However, they would appear to be a healthy outgrowth of the need of countries to give themselves a good enema once in awhile.

The Island," Sci-Fi With Soul - The Island
","See Michael, you can make a film without robots. I am not a big fan of Michael Bay (except for his very first robot film). But I glad to say, like the robots that evolved in this film, Michael Bay has evolved into a better director. He was already a master of action sequences, and special effects, and now he has added mastery of magnificent sets and depth to his characters; features missing from his previous efforts. I give him credit for improving his directorial skills. Most directors never improve; they just keep going back to the same formula some successful film that might have made money for them in the past. The story is a combination of Hunger Games and Logan's Run (an interesting hybrid), plus the current development of realistic robots. Although these humans are really just fresh body parts for the rich, they are just young children emotionally. They are not really robots. The story has a tragic element, too. It is the deception of innocence that the viewer finds the most monstrous about this type of film. There is seldom a more heinous scientific component to a film than the deception of thousands of innocent people. A job well done, Michael.",8,0,0,9 December 2018
