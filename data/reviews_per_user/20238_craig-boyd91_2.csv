Sucker Punch," Not great, but good fun all the same!
","Zack Snyder is without a doubt one of the best up and coming directors around. Watchmen and 300 are two of the best and most faithful Comic Book movies ever made. His visual style is incredible, and even though he remains faithful to the source; his style manages to add something new and invigorating to those graphic masterpieces. But every director has their missteps every now and then. Sucker Punch is Zack's first.When I say Snyder is a good director I mean just that... DIRECTOR! The man thrives with source material, but the problem here is... There is no source material. Zack Snyder co-wrote Sucker-Punch, and after watching it I believe the man should pick up a pen never again. The writing for Sucker Punch was nothing more than set-up after set-up for cool visuals, and that never works out very well Mr. Snyder.(see Avatar) However with that said, the visuals, and video game look and feel alone make this movie worth a trip to the theater.The big problem with Sucker Punch is that it never tries to tie in the 'Dream Worlds' with the 'Real World'. Yeah there end up being some real world consequences, but the action in the dreams never assimilate what's going on in reality. Having better tie-ins could have easily improved the movies dull conclusion. Instead the movie ends up playing out like a series of video game boss battles, which end up not being pretty fun to watch. If you go into Sucker Punch expecting mindless fun you'll get it, and you'll enjoy the hell out of it.All-in-all Sucker Punch isn't as bad as critics are making it out to be, but it is by no means great. It is a fun time at the movies, and like a video game, it's better with friends.6 out of 10",7,2,7,29 March 2011
The Social Network," Authentically Amazing
","When watching The Social Network the first thing that jumps out at you is the dialog. It is so fast paced and witty it barely leaves you any room to breathe. The second thing that jumps out at you is the amazing quality of the film, and it wasn't even shot on film. The Social Network was shot on a Red One Video camera. The cinematography was flawless, and mesmerizing. The acting fit perfectly, and the soundtrack was superb. The movie itself however is not flawless. It does drag on at times, and the ending was a bit abrupt it seemed. But the sheer quality and importance this film holds more than makes up for those minor setbacks. The most powerful performance came from the lead Jesse Eisenberg. His strong on screen presence was undeniable. He commanded the attention in every scene he was in, and drew us closer and closer to understanding this very complicated person. Overall The Social Network is the third best movie of the year behind Inception, and Toy Story 3, and I expect it to clean house at the Oscars.",8,2,5,4 October 2010
