Black Swan," My favourite Aronofsky to date
","It takes the terrestrial story of a ballerina desperate for the role of the Swan Queen in 'Swan Lake', a part requiring her to dance both the white and black swan, and turns it into a psychosexual, brooding and horrific descent into a personal Hell. Aronofsky does clearly have a taste for the theme of a personal descent or journey; in some way or another the idea has been the subject of every film he has made so far. This could be a complaint about him being 'samey', but he does it with such verve every time, each film so vivid and unique an experience on its own, it is impossible to moan.Upon seeing 'Black Swan' the first time through, I found myself rather numb; the film is so vivid, I knew what I had seen was good, but it was hard for me to discern whether I had actually enjoyed it. Having seen it twice now, I can confirm it is a masterpiece; it moved me far closer to tears on a few occasions the second time through, and is my personal favourite of Aronofsky's work so far.What is fascinating about the film is that a lot of the ideas are long-held penchants of foreign art house and horror. Indeed, I take a rather sadistic pleasure, as a fan of the director, from the thought that a lot of people walking into the film, believing they are getting an average thriller, might be rather shocked by the unexpected elements. Once over the standard setup, the film rapidly takes you on a trip into a world of competition, obsession, self-harm, duality, sexuality, violence, psychosis and body-horror....oh, and overbearing mothers! We watch the whole thing through the eyes of Nina, played with ridiculous dedication and power by Natalie Portman, whilst the pressure of the role and obsession with being perfect ruins her mind, splits her personality, and drives her to ever-worsening degrees of paranoia. On the point of performances, I also give praise to the always-overlooked Vincent Cassel, whose acting I recognised, on second viewing, to be far more precise and thoughtful than I first gave credit for.Anybody familiar with his previous efforts, 'Pi' and 'Requiem For A Dream', will already know how well Aronofsky can put the broken psyche on screen, and anyone who has seen 'The Fountain' and 'The Wrestler' will understand how ambitious, daring, and emotional a filmmaker he is. With 'Black Swan' he manages to inject all of those elements into one piece of cinema; it is intense, emotional, dark, upsetting, intimate and beautiful, haunting and bold. The colour schemes, the staging of scenes, Clint Mansell's original score, the editing and sound; everything is so well-orchestrated, with nearly every scene being essay-worthy, that although not always hugely original in his techniques with this one, Aronofsky has made a film so startling, so hard to forget, it is impossible to not be in complete awe by the time the credits role",9,2,4,1 February 2011
Captain Phillips," Don't see this if you like your knuckles!
","With 'Captain Phillips', Paul Greengrass does what he clearly does best, bringing to life the events surrounding the hijacking of the Mearsk Alabama in 2009. As with all true stories, the question often asked is how close to reality are the events on screen. When it comes to this film, in terms of specifics, this is going to be a hard question to answer; there is a law suit ongoing and there seem to be some questions surrounding the supposed heroism, or lack thereof, of certain people involved.It is good, then, that Greengrass has not made a film that feels like it's going for the truth, but rather a balls-to-the-wall thriller which happens to be inspired by true events. Setting up from the outset with an approach that is immediately Greengrass, we see the titular Captian and the Somali pirates preparing for their respective jobs, and the word 'jobs' is key here, on both sides. The approach begins a motif, which returns at various points through the following two hours, of a mirroring of circumstances; as the film moves on, we see more and more that both Captain Phillips and Muse, the pirate leader, are victims of a wider issue, neither man much in control of anything. Much has been made of this humanising of the 'bad guys', and whilst it is true, it is also fair to say that Greengrass never pushes the point to the extent that we feel forced to sympathise specifically with them. Rather, and more importantly, we are encouraged to consider, along with Phillips, how and why these emaciated men are driven to commit such crime, and how such a sad state of affairs is allowed.Perhaps it may have been beneficial for the film to have explored the globalisation issues a little more, and it features a soundtrack which, whilst effective, does come across, at times, like a lazy rip-off of Hans Zimmer. That said, if it wasn't for the trademark voice of a director with whom we are now quite familiar thanks to the 'Bourne' sequels, we could be easily forgiven for thinking this is Ron 'Apollo 13' Howard at his absolute must-see best. The performances from the pirates (first time actors) seem unabashed by Hanks' presence, and in fact the reality that they never met before filming only creates a more palpable sense of fear and confusion. Indeed, Barkhad Abdi does not seem to be acting, it is more like he has just wandered into the film; he plays Phillips' equal and opposite with an apparently unshaken conviction. As for Tom Hanks? This is his most impressive performance since 'Road to Perdition', a film which itself let us see a side of Mr Hanks we hadn't seen before. From the moment he steps aboard the ship and begins running drills, we are sold; Hanks disappears and the stern Captain Phillips emerges. From here, the performance becomes increasingly compelling; this man can do so much with so little and it seems effortless, which so often results in us forgetting it is a performance. Here, the gradual breakdown of a proud and pragmatic man is perfectly pitched throughout, and the final scene sees the actor do something quite incredible, finding a gut-wrenching truth and hitting notes I don't think I've ever seen him hit so perfectly before. Yes, Hanks reminds us, at a time when perhaps we needed reminding, of why he is one of the greatest actors alive. Let's be honest, we do tend to forget.Greengrass makes the wise choices to never get melodramatic and to never leave the action, which never really lets up; events just keep escalating. From an early scene of pirates boarding the vessel, to a final act that makes the last half hour of 'Zero Dark Thirty' look fairly amateur, you frequently remind yourself that this must have been a logistical nightmare to shoot; the fact it has come out looking so great and edited so well is testament to a very controlled film maker. On nearly every level, 'Captain Phillips' is most certainly one of the films of the year. It is shot with energy, it is perfectly paced,with a knuckle-chewing level of intensity which rarely wanes. It is hard to recall the last time I was this completely engaged and 'with a character'; I WAS that guy in the bathtub at the end of 'The Truman Show'! As well as the full throttle thrills, it offers a tragic human drama that leaves you some food for thought. It may prove questionable as a documentary of fact, but as a thriller it is one of the best we will see for some time.",9,0,2,22 October 2013
Source Code," Not as good as his debut, but very impressive
","Captain Colter Stevens wakes up on board a train heading to Chicago, in a body he does not recognise and with no knowledge of what is going on. The train explodes and he finds himself in an unknown place, being told by a woman calling herself Goodwin that he is going back and doing the whole thing again, in order to find the bomber, and that he has an eight minute window in which to do so. So begins a dual-challenge for Stevens: to complete the mission, and to understand why he is there in the first place and what is going on.Duncan Jones is treading a slightly different path to his father, but is proving to have inherited the gene for creativity; I adored his debut 'Moon', and although perhaps not quite as good a movie (it would have taken another masterpiece to have stood up to such an impressive first film), his follow-up feature is still very enjoyable and exciting. 'Source Code' is not written by Jones, only directed, and is far more a balls-out thriller, but interestingly it still explores some similar themes and questions as 'Moon'. The slightly higher budget has been put to good use, although Jones is a director who proves that big explosions and incredible CGI effects are nothing without a brain, and that good filmmaking is more fundamental than those things; even in today's hi-tech, fast-moving world, a film still needs to do more than look pretty.Just like its predecessor, 'Source Code' sets you up with ideas you have seen explored elsewhere; where you could find the roots of 'Moon' in '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Solaris', 'Source Code' has closer kin in the likes of 'Speed' and 'Inception'. In the case of both of his movies, though, what marks them out as great is what he then does with those ideas and how much heart the films have. Granted, 'Source Code' is not quite as surprising as 'Moon', but it still proves to be an intelligent, challenging piece. Another thing I like about his films is the science of them; they do not skip over explanations, and he works hard to lay what some might consider complex ground work for his audience, ala Christopher Nolan.Despite some small quibbles with the movie, such as the fact Clint Mansell would have scored it better (I mention this because I know it was only timing and circumstance that prevented Jones working with him again), and the film actually having room for a bit more development in the central location (it is rare for me to say I feel a movie would have benefit from being longer), I still very much enjoyed myself and recommend it as a cinema trip! Jake Gyllenhaal continues to prove himself to be a terrific lead actor who can carry a film, and do not assume that the 'Groundhog Day' idea of the same eight minutes replaying time and time again gets boring; just as you get to a point where you feel it might get stale, the film changes things up; those who have seen 'Moon' will know just how surprising Jones is. The drip-feeding of information keeps you hooked, and just as interested as Captain Stevens in finding out what is happening.If Duncan Jones just keeps doing what he is doing, staying ambitious and not becoming lazy, I see good things ahead for him, and I see myself being a big fan!",8,0,1,8 April 2011
The Impossible," Where were the Oscar nods for set and sound?
","there has been complaint from certain quarters that the film somehow does a disservice to the family by making them white Brits, rather than sticking to the reality that they are Spanish. There is also claim that, by focusing on this one fortunate family's survival, the movie arrogantly disregards the experiences of those indigenous to the country, and those whose experiences were not so fortunate. I find the prior accusation petty, and the latter ludicrous. In casting big names Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor in the lead roles, they simply ensure that the budget necessary for the production is more likely to be granted, and covered; the story of the family is still honoured well. The idea that somehow we ignore the plight of anybody else is just silly; certain moments in the movie, and in particular the beautifully conceived final scene, touch very well on the fact that many were not so lucky. The title of the film itself ties in with Bayona's intent to illustrate just how rare the sort of good fortune it depicts was, and the family are shown to clearly understand this. I am flabbergasted people are reading it any other way, to be honest.The first ten minutes of this movie are filled with a tension; the fact we know what comes next makes the setup of Maria and Henry's great relationship with their boys, Lucas, Thomas and Simon somehow more distressing. The next forty minutes are truly a technical miracle; never before have I been in a cinema feeling quite so overwhelmed by the depiction of a natural disaster. Bayona uses incredible miniature sets, real water, terrifying use of sound, and superb in-camera make-up to stunning effect, forcing us to endure the entire tsunami as mother and son do. We follow Maria and Lucas' events for about an hour before cutting over to Henry, Thomas and Simon. I will say that there is, for me, something lacking in the second act of the film, but this is possibly because the first has blown you away to such an extent, the devastated quietness of what follows feels naturally muted.This said, the performances carry through very well; McGregor is heartbreaking, and particular note has to be given to all the boys, who we adore pretty much on the spot. I would also suggest keeping an eye open for Tom Holland, who plays Lucas; his arc and the maturity of his performance feels so wonderfully natural, it is a struggle to believe his only experience has been as Billy Elliott on stage, and voicing a character in 2010's Arrietty. Naomi Watts has been nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, and whilst I suspect she will not win, I can say I have not seen her giving such a physical and emotionally draining performance, and that if you only see her in this and Eastern Promises, you might be forgiven for believing she is English.This film does drain you; by the time you leave the movie, you do feel a little washed out, and thankful that in the end this is a story of human triumph over adversity and a celebration of spirit, rather than the dour tale it could have threatened to be. Despite a second act lacking the kinetic force of the first, and the fact that Watts and Holland are really the more compelling characters and performances, and despite some moments where the gorgeous score does seem to teeter on being too much, overall this is a recommended experience. I have no idea why it is not nominated for production design and sound editing, because it should wipe the floor in those categories.",7,1,2,1 February 2013
The Babadook," Not perfect but certainly refreshing
","We had the usual slew this year of Halloween fodder; from the people who brought us 'Insidious' and 'Paranormal Activity' came....more of the same. It's not that all these movies are necessarily bad, although to call 'The Conjuring' prequel 'Annaebelle' anything more might be a push, but the stories are generally paint-by-numbers, the abused jump-scare technique becomes tired fast, and in the case of 'Ouija', it could be fairly argued that watching paint dry might be more interesting. Part of this Autumn parade, and sadly overshadowed by every other film, was the Australian release 'The Babadook', starring the generally unfamiliar Essie Davies and the disturbingly in-tune 6-year-old Noah Wiseman.'The Babadook' is, for the most part, an intense two-hander, telling the story of Amelia, in a suspended state of grief after the loss of her husband years earlier, struggling to balance her work and the upbringing of her son Samuel; Davies and Wiseman play parent and child respectively. Samuel is difficult at the best of times; despite an abundance of affection for his mother, he exhibits a lack of obedience and apparently attention-seeking behaviour, which ranges from performing magic tricks to exasperating temper tantrums to efforts that are potentially lethal! Accompanying this is his growing obsession with protecting himself from the monsters that stalk him in his room and at school. One night little Samuel chooses a new bedtime story from the bookshelf, the mysterious, wonderfully designed, over-sized pop-up called 'The Babadook'. With only mild concern as to where this book actually came from, Ameliea begins to read. It is not long before the book is closed, the nightmarish thing left unfinished, but it is too late; Samuel is terrified of the man who will apparently come to get him, the man who they will not be able to get rid of. Other reviews may reveal more, but that is as much setup as I think one needs.Performances from both main parties are nothing short of phenomenal, with Davies in particular immediately touting an Oscar nomination with her range and ability to go to some uncomfortable places; her intensity brings to mind the forgotten Naomi Watts performance in 'Mulholland Drive'. No expense is spared on classic set and sound design, everything catering to the immersion and ever more startling and bleak tone. The movie is shot with a true artist's eye and edited with clear care; you can really see Kent's adoration of truly classic horror in silent cinema. On the downside, there is a moment that goes into territory that wouldn't be at all out of place in a David Lynch film, which can be said to be one metaphor too far, and speaking personally, a couple more intensely frightening moments with Mr Babadook himself would not have been pushing it too hard. That said, it is to Kent's credit that she eschews most conventions, and dresses those which might normally threaten to be trite in narrative importance rather than simply using them as shock fodder.The big question about any film adorned with such praise as this one is obviously, is it frightening? My answer to that is no, I did not find the film scary in the sense of being kept up at night. That is, however, only my response and says little about how much another person might react, or indeed about how much I actually enjoyed the film, which is another matter entirely. It is also not a question any one person will answer the same way; horror in cinema is a broad spectrum and whether one even classes 'The Babadook' as a horror depends on one's understanding of, and exposure to, the whole spectrum of the genre. If when you think horror, it is only the recent entourage of James Wan-style gore-fests and jump-scare fuelled ghost stories that come to mind, 'The Babadook' is liable to disappoint you, given its marketing. If, on the other hand, you see that horror can address psychological terror, that a story can ring terrifyingly true on an internal, emotional level, and you can cite 'Let The Right One In', and perhaps more pertinently in this case, 'We Need To Talk About Kevin', Stephen King's 'The Shining' and Polanski's 'Repulsion' as works that scare, then get ready for what you might consider the most refreshing piece of horror for a long time! After all, what was the last horror film you saw all about 'the power of love'. This is how writer/director Jennifer Kent explained the story to the young Wiseman, and she was being absolutely sincere.Going by this evidence, I don't doubt that Kent will one day make a masterpiece; this is, after all, one of the strongest directorial debuts I have seen, and whilst 'The Babadook' is perhaps not the film we were promised by the posters, it is nevertheless a surprisingly multi-faceted, emotionally affecting, gorgeous slice of dark imagination, which sincerely addresses a most real and important issue.",8,9,21,28 November 2014
Taxi Driver," Powerhouse film making
","Contrary to what might be the more common assertions that 'Raging Bull' or 'Goodfellas' are Scorsese at the top of his game, this earlier outing with De Niro was then, and still remains now, powerful, genuinely dark and startling! The themes you can see in this work are numerous; it is angry and political, it is visceral and controversial, the character study it presents is razor sharp in its precision. De Niro is studied and scary, truly on the edge and taking the audience with him, a perfect anti-hero, and Scorsese drives another knife into the belly of the Hollywood machine with an anti-saccharine vision, which is bold, shocking, and uncensored in a way that may not have been so easy nowadays. A powerful piece of cinema, full of iconic ideas and imagery that are hard to forget",10,0,0,1 January 2011
Shutter Island," Twisted fun, and Scorsese knows it
","This is Scorsese's first real step into the horror genre, or rather a step closer to it, as in reality this isn't so much a horror as it is a psychological thriller. It is based on the book by Dennis Lehane; it tells the story of U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule, assigned to the case of an escaped patient at Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. Having arrived, it becomes apparent to Teddy that there is more to this escape than anybody on the island is letting on, and when he is refused access to the hospital records, he becomes convinced there is a conspiracy at work. With a storm cutting communications and transport off the island, the scene is set for a compelling, exciting, and rather mind-bending thriller.The fourth outing for DiCaprio with Scorsese, and it is clear there is no stopping the wonders they work together. Truth is, this is a B-movie, but it's dressed up as a main feature by the production value, director and cast, which includes a very good Mark Ruffalo and a surprising turn from Max Von Syndow. We get hard-boiled, 50's pulp-style performances, with everybody having a lot of fun in their roles (most notably Ben Kingsley, as the suspicious Dr. Cawley), and an over the top, obtuse soundtrack. The film is self-aware, however, and the nods towards classic Film Noir (there are distinct echoes of the Alan Parker classic with De Niro and Mickey Rourke, 'Angel Heart'), and Hitchcock, are more than obvious. It could be said that if Hitchcock were alive, doing today what he was known for in his time, this is the film he would probably make.There is a sense with the film that Scorsese picked it up to have some fun, in an area he hasn't really visited, before going back to being a 'serious' filmmaker, but the things that make him one of the most important directors of all time are still very much present. His camera language to tell the story remains second to none (and on repeat viewing, it proves to be very clever), and his Hitchcock-style 'trick shots' and some devious editing are nicely shown off. The unexpected moments of humour never interrupt the dark tone of the piece, the tension ratchets up well as the drama unfolds, and the emotional level the film hits is actually quite surprising.A big thing I would address is the twist to the film, which there is a already a lot of debate over. As previously mentioned, the device itself is one that we aren't unfamiliar with in contemporary cinema, and I did find myself thinking that if you don't at least have a suspicion as to the way it is going to play out by a certain point in the film, then you're really not trying very hard. That said, in watching how Scorsese executes the action, I genuinely got the feeling he already acknowledges this, and so it is no surprise that it is he, not Lehane, who is responsible for the extra spice added to the finaleThough I personally did see it coming, I must say the final act of the film is more elaborate than I would have expected, and what I really like is how its intension seems to be to put the audience in a spin and place you firmly in the character's shoes, which it does successfully. It is also rather impressive how the twist to 'Shutter Island', unlike most which simply turn the story in a direction you didn't expect, really opens up various interpretations on everything you have just seen, meaning the film begs to be watched a second time. Upon repeat viewing, it is clear that it is smarter than you first thought, multi-layered, with imagery and dialogue intricately woven to create a rich design, incorporating not only the story as it stands, but also very subtle commentaries on the treatment of the mentally ill, communism and World War 2. What is great about these things is that they are not over-bearing and don't have to be there if you choose not to look for them.Is it Scorsese at his best? Certainly not; it's a little baggy and it doesn't carry the 'Classic' stamp like 'Goodfellas', 'Taxi Driver' and 'The Aviator', but I would argue that he didn't expect it to. As I say, it still carries many of the technical fingerprints that make it undeniably Scorsese, so treat it as I think he did, a little bit of twisted, exciting fun! Go with it, and you'll thoroughly enjoy yourself",7,0,2,1 January 2011
Life of Pi," Astonishing
","Pi Patel, played for the most part by Suraj Sharma with a confidence defying his absolute inexperience in front of the camera, and surely qualifying him for a Best Actor nod at the Oscars, is thrust into an adventure of survival at sea. The ship carrying his family and their zoo hits bad waters, inexplicably sinks, and from there he must learn how to share the confined space of a lifeboat with his only companion, a tiger named Richard Parker.Like 'Cast Away', due to its idea a great deal of the film is without speech, save for Pi's one way conversations with the animal and the occasional narration by adult Pi, played by a spectacular Irrfan Khan, who is telling his tale to an author, one who is after a great story that will 'make you believe in God'. Also much like another of this year's spectaculars, 'The Hobbit', the front end of the movie is loaded with a lot of setup, which those who who only saw the trailer may find surprisingly hefty. Unlike 'The Hobbit', however, this front end engages you fast and it is not long before you are enjoying the development of Pi as a character, the amusing finding of his faith, his love, and his place in the family. Some genuinely hearty and smart humour can be found in this first act, also. The brilliance is that whilst it is not in any rush to get where we all know it is headed, at no point is there any wish for Lee to push it along faster; there is some understanding intrinsic to the direction that this is all important and not to be overlooked, which even those who have not read the hugely popular book pick up on. To add to this, it must be said that the length and pacing of this movie is outstanding; you would not want any more or less time spent basking in the warmth of the love and care that clearly went into putting every single gorgeous frame on the screen. The second act is where we really see the film kick into gear and start rolling out what is stunning audiences and critics alike. From the greatest CGI animal I think I have seen on the silver screen, to the overwhelmingly beautiful photography, effects, and perhaps not the first, but certainly the best use of 3D technology to enhance the engagement with a story, 'Life Of Pi' sweeps the floor visually with anything previously held up as a bar setter. Nothing against those previous movies, but it really does. All of this is obviously nothing without everything else being in place, and thankfully Ang Lee knows that the heart of his film is not how pretty it is, but the story by Yann Martel and the themes with which it deals. So what is 'Life Of Pi' about? The wonderful thing about this piece is that this answer could be different for you than it was for me. It is about a boy surviving at sea with a tiger. It is about the nature of life, death and loss. It is about the balance of fear and respect. It is about love and hope. It is about humanity and compassion. It is about religion and faith, faith not just in a higher power, but in anything in the world. It is about all of these things at once, but what I most took away from this film is how it is about the nature of nature itself. Yes, it sounds heavy and preachy, doesn't it? The truth is Lee gets the balance absolutely spot on; you take from the movie what you want and at no point does it preach at you about anything. It does not matter how you walk in, an atheist, a Hindu, a Christian, but if you are a human being with anything close to an open heart and mind, you might just walk out feeling a better person! Released for the festive season, it is an oddly uplifting film that entertains on one hand, and on the other is positively philosophical about our place in nature, our treatment of her, and of one another. Not often would I say that a film might just change your life, but as the film reached its finale, with both Sharma and Khan absolutely owning their respective final scenes, I realised I had been inescapably moved to tears more than once, had consciously assessed how I think about certain things, and that yes, this film just might change you for the better. Is the preceding challenge to make a character believe in God achieved? That would be telling, but more importantly, it does not matter; in a rather smart bit of writing and beautiful execution, the film underlines that this is not really the point, and indeed should never be. Ang Lee is a man who directs with a heart full of compassion, and a head full to its brim with an understanding of cinema's sheer power to entertain, engage and challenge, sometimes all at once. A look at his previous work is evidence enough of this; sure, not everything is a hit, but never could his passion for cinema, bravery and humanity, be more on show than with 'Life Of Pi'. He has done what was said to be impossible, taken a book that should never have translated to cinema, and not only made a successful film, but made the all-round best spectacular to hit the big screen since Nolan's 'Inception'! A loss at the Oscars for its visuals and adaption for screen, at the very least, would be a sin! Regardless of one's reaction to the movie, Ang Lee may well have created his masterpiece.",10,4,8,22 December 2012
Full Metal Jacket," Perfect war movie
","He could be cold, harsh and mechanical with his style, precise as a surgeon's knife, and some didn't like that, but who better to make a film, not about war, but about the dehumanisation of the process, but Stanley Kubrick? The fact his vision of the story was so clinical really helped make this, quietly, the best war film ever made; Stanely never did things by halves.Every frame is weighted with oppression, each moment is saying something; every line, every gesture, delivered to fit Kubrick's vision. It made a star of Lee Ermey, whose Drill Sergeant was terrifyingly real, primarily because that is what he was in reality.Like all of Kubrick's work, this film contains iconic imagery that sears into your mind's eye and becomes very hard to erase; the final scenes, and the film's closing, with its perfect marriage of image, sound, and music, haunt you and leave you reflecting on the last 2 two hours.",10,4,6,2 January 2011
Pacific Rim," Some of the best big, dumb fun you are likely to see
","The creative maestro behind such films as 'The Devil's Backbone' and the masterpiece 'Pan's Labrynth', it is fair to say Guilermo del Toro is no stranger to dark, deep stories with heart and soul, so it is a surprise to see 'Pacific Rim' actually comes off rather light and fun.To my surprise, the story of a future on Earth where mankind does regular battle with aliens, who attack from deep beneath the ocean via a bridge between their dimension and ours, lacks in development; the movie also falters with some awkward moments where the staging seems in need of a polish or a re-write. Performances are, for the most part pretty good, with a highlight being del Toro regular and fan favourite Ron Pearlman, his introduction clearly indicating how aware they are of how popular a casting choice he is. To the negative, most notable are, strangely, the male leads, who seem, at best going through motions, or at worst unbelievable. All that said, however, del Toro knows precisely the film he is making here and awards courting performances did not weigh too heavily on his mind, unlike the fantastic score, which actually should go up for an Oscar next year, being one of the best elements of the movie. It should also go without saying that it is visually spectacular, grand in scope and precise in detail. Despite its lightness in tone and the fact that it is ultimately little more than a huge summer blockbuster, del Toro directs with an assured hand, the likes of which Michael Bay can only dream he had. This is big, dumb fun, but really good, well designed big, dumb fun. Definitely whets the appetite for what he may have in store if he can ever get Lovecraft's 'At The Mountains of Madness' on to the screen.",7,0,6,23 July 2013
Man of Steel," Disappointing
","The story idea is good, typical of Goyer. Some of the scenes are good; the performances are pretty good, with Kevin Costner turning in a fantastic one. In fact, it's fair to say he is under-used. The film does also look and sound very fancy; Hans Zimmer once again brings the magic he is so well known for, but sadly the execution is overblown and all over the place; exactly the sort of approach I would expect, and was worried about, from Snyder. The man has very little grasp on how to actually tell a story, and after the first rather choppy hour of substance, he quickly loses himself in his own playground; he even brings it in too long. So all in all, it's not without its merits and is generally a decent blockbuster, but the good moments aside, this is ultimately disappointing; a lot of talent squandered.",6,2,5,24 June 2013
The Shining," Kubrick's best horror.....Kubrick's only horror...
","Stanley Kubrick turns his ever-precise eye to Stephen King's novel, and although far more a supernatural horror than the familial psychodrama King intended, the film stands alone as an absolute masterpiece (and ironically far more exciting and memorable than King's own mini-series adaption). Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrence, a writer who takes a care-taking post at The Overlook Hotel for the winter period; he is intent on using the time to get a new writing project underway. After moving in, it quickly becomes apparent there is something wrong with the hotel, and its effect on Jack is apparently to drive him insane and desperate to destroy his family. Shelley Duvall and young Danny Lloyd play wife and child with nowhere to go.Kubrick is a filmmaker's filmmaker, and as is nearly always the case with his work, one of the biggest stars of 'The Shining' is the man's technical brilliance and desire to push the envelope. From the famous, grand shots at the beginning (it has been difficult ever since to see epic aerial landscape photography without being reminded of the opening of this film), to some of the best steadicam work you will see, even when compared to the movies of today, it is a cinematic tour-de-force. Kubrick's attention to details whose job it is, if only on a subconscious level, to put you constantly on edge is rather impressive; before the production, he read Freud's essay 'The Uncanny', about the feeling of something being uncomfortably strange whilst remaining familiar, and was intent on working that theme in at many a turn. What better film to work it into than one about the man who is supposed to love you wanting to murder you? Not a frame is wasted, and rarely is a moment not visually arresting, tense of unnerving, due to unique framing, lighting, or noticeably exciting camera language. The result is a movie with numerous iconic scenes and startling imagery. The soundtrack also might just be one of the most jarring and haunting in horror cinema; dense, loud, dissonant strings and found sounds shred regularly at your nerves. One of the film's best moments combines all the above, and may leave you with nightmares of little boys muttering 'Redrum' at your bedside...as if kids doing strange things wasn't creepy enough! This is a film you may find you do not love immediately; as always with Kubrick, there is a lot to take in, and the sense that he is making the film to be interesting rather than necessarily realistic is never far away. Detractors of the film cite the over-the-top nature of Nicholson's performance to be one of the issues they have with it, but I think Kubrick knew the absurdity of the character, the dark humour played against the isolated horror setting, would really accentuate the pressure, discomfort and sense of entrapment, with nobody else to turn to, Wendy and Danny are suffering. After a few viewings, 'The Shining' should start to reveal itself to you as the masterpiece it is.Far more Kubrick's than King's, and his only horror film, this still retains its status as one of the best-made of all time. He never did things by halves.",10,0,1,27 March 2011
Dunkirk," Staggering cinema. Not 'getting it' is very much on you...
","It' s 1940, 400,000 allied troops are cornered and cut off on the beaches of Dunkirk; with the enemy closing in, and no cover or defence, they await annihilation or a miracle. We experience the moment as the characters do, without unnecessary exposition or dialogue! This proves quite the departure for Nolan; there is a lot here that owes more to silent cinema than anything else, but his images often say all that needs to be said.An opening frame invites us to join a group of soldiers. Next, the loudest onslaught of gunfire kicks the film into another gear. We are given as much pause for thought as the soldiers we follow. We run with Tommy, played here by a Fionn Whitehead, and like him, we are aware of comrades falling dead next to us, but it is all panic and no time; we will lament their loss later. Set to the ticking of a watch, we feel Tommy's heart pounding with ours, and we know the tone for this audacious movie has been set.We see the event from different perspectives and from within different time frames. Right now, not many directors can build momentum like Nolan. The jumping to and from different characters' point of view, the corkscrewing impression of the editing, events echoed and mirrored by Hans Zimmer's Shepherd's Tones and persistent, all enveloping score, acting at times more like sound design than music; it all results in a constant rise in tension, to the point of almost being exhaustive.This said, the editing also serves another purpose. The 'Miracle of Dunkirk' is a grand story, with every soldier, every pilot, and every civilian having their own point of view. Nolan wants us to build up an overall picture of the event purely through subjective experience, so of course we spend a tiring week with the terrified boys. Of course we spend a desperate day with a fisherman as he and his familial crew sail their way into action. Lastly, given the fuel constraints of the RAF, whose decisions had to be immediate and impulsive, always a choice between defending the beach or getting home, why would we spend any more that an edge-of-your-seat, quickly-cut hour in the cockpit of a Spitfire, as they do their duty and enter into dogfights to keep the German aircraft at bay? Each timeline is contracted or dilated to give everybody equal measure and importance, whilst staying true to and very much in their situation. Yes, this means we're kept on our toes; we have moments of confusion as timelines cross over and we see the same thing happening from another point of view, but as we head into the finale, as well as the aforementioned tension and release (which is just exciting cinema), we also get to see how, despite very different perspectives, everyone was working together, and how sacrifice and struggle for duty were par for the course for all involved, whether other people knew it or not. It is important that we the audience recognise this bigger picture, and as everything clicks together in an emotive final convergence of efforts, we not only see the justification for the techniques adopted, but struggle to imagine the story told another way. That is, at least, without going down a standard route, with objective storytelling employed.A proper review not being complete without comment on the elephant in the room, it must be said that Harry Styles does not stand out like the proverbial sore thumb at all. Frankly, he carries his scenes with aplomb, and surely, following the Heath Ledger lesson, and now this, it is time we learned that, maybe, Christopher Nolan just knows what he's doing better that we do? As to the other big names, there are moments from that remain with me so long after having seen it: Kenneth Brannagh and Mark Rylance can say so much with so little, their faces and gestures doing the heavy lifting to deliver a lot of the human emotion, and it would appear Tom Hardy has Oscar-worthy eyes! You need see nothing more through the course of his drama to have a complete sense of the type of man his Farrier is. We talk about great acting and achieving realism through imagination, but with the knowledge that Nolan actually took everyone to Dunkirk, sank real ships, sailed real ships, flew real Spitfires overhead, employed real explosions on the beach, and even rejected green screen and CGI in favour of cardboard cut-outs, it seems imagination wasn't too necessary for these already consummate actors.Nolan's principle fan base will be well prepared for what they get; but with his insistence on holding back from the audience any perspective not afforded his characters, ala 'Memento', some knowledge of the 'Miracle Of Dunkirk' might put the more casual viewer in better stead. Regardless of which camp you fall into, or indeed of whether or not the movie does it for you, certain things are for sure: With no melodrama or cheese, and no superfluous fluff or emotional subterfuge, 'Dunkirk' is a purely experiential movie, a technical marvel of a war film unlike any other I can name. It also stands as a beacon in Nolan's career, characterised by his desire to cultivate an audience willing to keep up with him. And perhaps most importantly, this is a key moment in world history that is often overlooked; a disaster averted which, had it not been, would have seen the history books written very differently. That this event has been marshalled by a confident and sincere director, who has surely by now cemented his name alongside those of his own heroes, is reason enough to see 'Dunkirk'.",10,8,16,29 July 2017
American History X," Blistering!
","My introduction to the screen presence that is Edward Norton, this film is astonishing. Norton OWNS this movie, and apparently not just on screen; legend has it that Tony Kaye disowned his film, as he was ultimately not happy with how it came out, and that there was major turmoil between him and the principal cast. You would not know, going by what you get as the final product (it makes me curious how different Kaye's vision was to begin with).A powerful piece of work from beginning to end, it is uncompromising. It presents the story very much from a 'Devil's Advocate' point of view; Norton's character is presented as intelligent, and in his twisted way, a caring brother, son and boyfriend. It presents the neo-Nazi argument as one that you can ALMOST understand and empathise with. Some would say this is dangerous, but I believe it is just honest and intelligent storytelling.It is not just in the way the story is told that it pulls no punches; the violence is tough and unflinching, showing just a bit more than you feel you need to see, to drive the point home. The now infamous 'bite the kerb' scene remains one that scars you for some time. The film's finale is still one of the most surprising, shocking and poignant I can think of. The message of the film regarding hate and anger is brilliantly stated in the final act. Performances from a stellar cast, headed by Ed Norton in what remains his most controversial and powerful screen role.Approach with some caution, but definitely approach!",10,0,3,22 January 2011
The Usual Suspects," Noir at its best
","Forget M. Night Shyamalan with his plot holes and fall-apart final acts, this film has, unarguably, the most well-executed finale of this sort, at least of the 90s! Great writing, shuffling time frame to keep you on your feet, details and full scenes that see completely different the second time you see it, and brilliantly played from top to bottom, this is Film Noir at its best! The fact Bryan Singer was a young first-time director makes the whole thing all the more incredible to watch; you simply can't believe this is the product of a crew healmed by somebody so supposedly inexperienced. In his own words, perhaps if he tried to make this now, he wouldn't be able to......so I say, thanks goodness it came to him when it did! To say anything else would be to spoil the experience....just see it!",10,2,3,1 January 2011
Mamma Mia!," Nothing could save this...
","I resisted for so long, but I figured it only fair to give 'Mamma Mia' a fair hearing, and tried very hard to go in with an open mind. It is fair to say I'm no Abba fan, but I am a fan of some of the players in this film, and so thought there could be an element of watch-ability to this adaption of what I understand to be a popular musical. With that in mind, and understanding it was only supposed to be a light romp, I was ready to give it a fair go.I was wrong, there was barely anything close to watchable about this attempt at a film. I say barely, because I did get a kick from watching those members of the cast who clearly treated this as a holiday, Julie Walters and Colin Firth, for example, having a great deal of fun on a Greek Island, generally messing about, singing Abba songs badly, and in Walters' case, I believe genuinely being at various stages of inebriation whilst filming.....throughout the entire production! We have Meryl Streep taking the whole thing far too seriously (I love Meryl's acting abilities, but here is not the place to be doing it like this), Colin Firth looking decidedly uncomfortable with every passing scene (the gradual realisation that he has signed up to make a piece of crap?), and everyone else (barring Julie Wlaters, as previously mentioned) giving a hugely forgettable, unfunny, and for the most part stupid performance. This does not, however, include Pierce Brosnan. When I was told his singing is awful, I thought people were exaggerating, and even his performance of 'S.O.S.' is passable for a man who 'can't sing'. Of course, little did I know that he performs one of the closing numbers; did nobody, at any point, realise this was ear-bleedingly atrocious and think to overdub with....someone else?? It really IS that bad, and for this reason, I fear HIS performance will never be forgotten....sadly.As musicals go (I would point out that I have no problem with, and even like a good musical), this is a disgrace to the genre. The idea is stupid, plot points created purely to crowbar more Abba songs in, and the story rapidly goes out the window anyway, the film quickly becoming a pastiche of a load of pretty good actors prancing about. Its colourfulness and playfulness become spirit-crushing and headache- inducing, and even for the most ardent Abba fan, I find it hard to believe the songs come through and save the day.I am aware this review marks me out to be a grumpy, egotistical geek, and perhaps that is so, but make no mistake, I can do fun! I like fun, jolly romps, but I could not enjoy this film on any level, even an ironic 'isn't this funny' one. No, it is not funny, I am getting bored, and TIRED! Jesus, this film drags! People moaned about the ending of 'Return Of The King' being 'too many endings', but at least the idea was to tie up all the characters' stories and actually close the film. 'Mamma Mia' ends...then it ends...and then it seems to end again! I kid you not, I'm sure it must be close to ten minutes, waiting for the credits to roll. And all because we need more songs, apparently. I have never been this close to clawing my eyes out.You couldn't pay me to put myself through this torture again.",2,3,4,15 January 2011
Twilight," A strange experience with this one.....Read on
","After much maligning of 'Twilight' by everyone I know, I stayed well away from it. It later occurred to me, however, that it is unfair to join in with the slandering, having not actually experienced it myself.Due to so many people's view that the film is utter rubbish, I was nicely built up for a major fall, fully expecting to despise everything about it; when my reaction was rather tepid, it actually felt like a positive! These are things that, to my own surprise, I didn't think were too bad: The idea, on paper, I can see is actually quite a good one. It's an interesting take on the vampire story and though I have not read Meyers' books, I can imagine them to be quite engaging. There is a little allusion to the classic star-crossed lovers, Romeo and Juliet, though if any of the dialogue and character engagements in this film are lifted directly from the book, Meyers is certainly no Shakespeare.The principal cast do the best with what they are given, though I can imagine in many years to come, Robert Pattinson may look back on this Saga in the same way Kevin Bacon famously does on 'Footloose'; whilst being the making of him, he certainly wishes it wasn't. That said, I was pleasantly surprised to find that, unlike Mr Orlando Bloom, who quite frankly cannot act for toffees, Pattinson isn't just a pretty face and at least has some conviction in what he's doing, the occasional bad delivery aside. Given time, I can see him becoming more solid. Kristen Stewart plays Bella and doesn't do too badly; not much else to say on her really. Oddly enough, possibly the best performance in the film is a character I can see getting rather overlooked; Bella's father, Charlie. He is played by Billy Burke, an actor of subtlety and unquestionable command of what is a relatively small role. The rest of the cast are simply fodder, but it is quite a compliment, in what is a very mediocre film, to say that none of the principal actors are weak.The original score stood out for me; I found the main theme to capture the drama nicely, and to be dark, aggressive and yet graceful, which compliments the story being told very nicely. It could be argued, in fact, that this was the element of the film that most caught my attention in a positive way. Conversely, however, there are a couple of moments in the film where I did wonder how Catherine Hardwicke, the director, had decided that the music fit, because it really doesn't! It is in fact directorial decisions that are the true let down for 'Twilight'. The efforts to transfer the story's themes of abstinence to the screen, and to create the metaphor of the decisions a girl must make about what makes a boy the right choice, are fair attempts, but are flawed by a bad screenplay and a director who, to call ham-fisted, would be an understatement! We have lingering shots that aren't necessary in any way other than, it would seem, to glorify somebody's cheekbones; badly judged, long pauses that are supposed to hold tension, both sexual and dramatic, which actually just leave you feeling like you should leave the two lovers alone for a while. We then have drawn out montages, in which we think 'Yes, I get it, they fancy each other, let's move forward now,' and moments that possibly worked in imagination, but should have been the first thing ditched when making the film, such as glittering vampires (the effect of which was actually quite disappointing; I didn't see much difference). We also have rogue 'bad' vampires, who appear to carry around their very own fog machine. This last element ruined what was otherwise one of the better, more fun scenes in the film.Another pivotal moment, during which I thought perhaps she had actually managed to shoot something well, is the conversation between Bella and Edward about what he is. It is all going well until we get an out of the blue, unnecessary 'MTV' moment, with the camera darting all over the place. I assume this is to hold the attention of its audience, but all it does is kill the moment flat. There are many other flaws I could pick out, such as Edward's incessant need to keep returning to Bella every few minutes, only to remind her of why she should stay away from him (I understand it is an attempt to illustrate the idea of not being able to resist someone, but it is pushed too far and looks stupid).'Dawson's Creek with vampires' nicely sums up how I feel about this film, even in its tone! The character arcs and conversations feel like they're straight from an American High School TV drama (except this is shot worse, at points), but in that context, it does what it sets out to do. Please note that in rating this film, whilst I would personally give it a one-out-of-five, simply for all the previous issues, I am taking into account the target audience it had right from the start, which I assume is the same as that for the book (coming-of-age school or college girls), and not an audience who perhaps appreciate the 'Vampire' genre outside of this film. If you fit the demographic, 'Twilight', with all its awful direction, is likely to still hold your attention.",3,3,5,1 January 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Baggy Bag End
","I admire Peter Jackson, coming from the world of low-budget horror, his desire to take on the epic Lord Of The Rings, and ability to deliver what he did, is hugely impressive. His love for the source material was very clear, and despite anything about that trilogy with which I may have my reservations, it was a near masterpiece. Now here we are, about a decade on, with Martin Freeman taking on the role of Bilbo Baggins, in what we could consider a prequel, though they were never written that way; truth be told, in the long-run it won't matter which way round the movies were made, this is a separate story and, importantly, a different tone.There are many good things about this film, much to be admired, but Jackson's adoration for the source is still well on show, and unfortunately this means he wants to cram a lot of superfluous material in to what should have been a straightforward adaption of a children's book. Whether you be a die hard fan who remains excited for Jackson's inclusion of all sorts of other Tolkein material that isn't strictly 'The Hobbit', or a casual viewer who does not know the first thing about Tolkein's tale, one thing is unarguable, this film is far too long. With an extremely baggy introduction at bag end, and an awful lot of exposition, it is a good forty minutes or so before we hit any sort of movement in the narrative; this would not have mattered so much if a lot of the introductory material didn't end up feeling quite so inconsequential. Then there is the struggle to balance the lightness of 'The Hobbit' with the tone set by 'Lord of the Rings'; on one hand the film displays a sort of whimsy, on another it wants to be dark and epic, the prior feeling at times strangely awkward when punctuating the latter. For this critic at least, it means you never quite feel completely comfortable and 'in gear' with the movie; I think it speaks volumes that the film is at its obvious best when it is most like the previous trilogy, the Riddles in the Dark scene with Gollum clearly standing out as a highlight.Then we have the choice to shoot at double the normal film speed; with many theatres still catching up with this technology, the likelihood is this won't bother most who see it projected at normal speed, but why bother shooting this way? It is commonly said to make things feel too real, and remove the magic of cinema from the piece, something I would have expected Jackson to recognise quite early on and avoid. There is no reason to see this any way other than 2D at normal speed.Do not get me wrong, 'An Unexpected Journey' is an enjoyable film for many reasons, not least of which are the performances of Martin Freeman, Andy Serkis and Sir Ian McKellen, who can make even the most dull moment seem like more, and the score is typically gorgeous. I wait to see what the next two instalments do, but it is fair to say that based on the evidence of this movie alone, perhaps a bit more discipline and the creation of one 210 minute film may have been more wise; this is a movie that should have been incredible, but is overly bloated and feels, at times, burdened by a little too much indulgence, and so ends up being just very good.",6,1,9,16 December 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Impressive, if not for all
","Wes Anderson is generally a film maker you either 'get' or 'don't get' ; not getting him does not necessarily reflect the quality of the movie. I fall into the camp who can never quite get on board with him, so it is great praise to say I thoroughly enjoyed myself with this light soufflé of a movie. There may be argument about a certain emotional distance from the central theme, or that the film is ultimately less consequential than it should be; in the background of this caper is a looming fascism; the lightness seems at odds with the potential drama of the original writings from which the film takes inspiration. There is also a certain lack of development of characters, although something about the tone allows for this; in any case, it is made up for, to some extent, by the fact that the thing is rammed full of mostly welcome cameos, clearly having a lot of fun with the little moments they have. In another work this may have proved distracting, but in fact here it seems to enhance the enjoyment of events. It is a fresh, offbeat, well designed and choreographed piece; the storybook flourishes, the wonderfully vibrant dialogue, sets designed to withing an inch of life, camera moves and cinematography make the whole thing very sweet and amusing to behold, and this is without mentioning rather splendid, comical central turn from Ralph Fiennes.So, to use an appropriate analogy, I found it to be like admiring a really well baked and decorated wedding cake, with all the clever, beautiful trimmings, but when taking a bite, finding there's an ingredient you're not particularly keen on. It doesn't take away from how much you admire the work that went into it, but you can't say you enjoyed it as much as everyone else seems to have done. All credit to Anderson for creating what is clearly a smart and audacious work of art, and it is with this in mind I rate it as highly as I do, but would I watch it again? Perhaps once, to see what I missed, but after that, I don't think so. Many would, though, and I can't ignore that fact.",7,1,8,17 March 2014
Gone Girl," Dark, twisted, gleeful fun, which leaves you food for thought
","How does one discuss a movie that is essentially a minefield of spoilers? It is the case with most thrillers that we do not reveal its big twists and turns, but in the case of 'Gone Girl', talking about anything beyond the setup could ruin it! You want to make a point about something that feels so insignificant to you, only to catch yourself, realising you're about to tarnish it for the uninitiated, for whom every 'little' thing is going to seem pretty huge. Still, I'll give a shot. Nick Dunne arrives home on his fifth wedding anniversary to find his wife Amy missing, with signs of a a violent struggle the only truly concerning clue as to what may have happened. The investigation starts out normally enough, but as the news frenzy begins and media-unfriendly Nick's response is put under the microscope, he finds himself many people's number one suspect. We assume we have seen this setup before, and we think it is going to simply be a case of did he, didn't he? We might even start to make up our own minds. And then 'Gone Girl' pulls out some unexpected guns, twisting and morphing as it goes, from domestic drama through thriller to twisted satire, playing games of which Hitchcock may have been jealous (there are more than a few shades of 'Vertigo' and 'Strangers On A Train' here).Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross return for a third collaboration with director David Fincher. Their score slips by almost unnoticed to begin with; it is a gentle, calm serenade. Then, as author Gillian Flynn's tale reveals itself to be one in which nothing is as it seems, their music rots from the inside out, moving from barely noted serenity to unmissable static and electronic crunching, poisoning the scenes with further tension. I don't know that it has the same uncomfortable power as 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo', but it is nevertheless precisely what the film needs. Fincher is now famous for his precise eye, making every frame a painting, and here there is no exception. His dedicated fans will note a lack off flash in the first 90 minutes or so, with the director allowing the story and characters to calmly take the lead; or course we recognise this is intentional. Wait for the final hour and you'll see the man who made 'Panic Room' let rip! Film students would have a great time examining the change; all aesthetics here serve the story. It is fair to say it is a little too long for its own good; certainly there is trimming that could be performed at the front end of the film, but once it gets into the right gear, it really does not loosen its grip.Ben Affleck has taken a lot of flack in the past, and perhaps this puts him in a perfect spot to play Nick, the everyman who is long passed the point of even trying to be perfect, and now suffering a quite unforgiving public scrutiny. England's own Rosamund Pike plays his 'Amazing Amy', the cool girl who secretly knows she never quite lived up to the character her parents modelled after her, forging a lucrative book series. Pike may well win a Best Actress Oscar and that is all you need to know. There are other notable turns in the film, but one that has not been praised quite enough is Carrie Coon, playing Margo, Nick's sometimes suffering sister. If anything, she doesn't have enough screen time to develop as much as you would like to see; her performance is riveting and I would have liked more of the chemistry she brought. Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris both surprise with the material they have, although in both cases, more character meat would have been welcome.Those who have already read the book by the time they see 'Gone Girl' will be pleasantly surprised by just how loyal screenwriter Flynn is to her own novel, and many, like me, may also be happy to see that the final act, somewhat tough to buy on the page, becomes a different animal under David Fincher's careful direction. His gear shifts are so clear and concise, the viewer is in little doubt about the terrain of each act, and the final section of the movie takes what was, for me, a questionable set of circumstances and character motivations, and then turns them into something altogether more dark, chilling and bitingly satirical; in this context, it somehow just works better! Those who might raise questions about elements I cannot mention here (this is getting silly!), or the 'unsatisfying nature of the finale' may have missed one of the various points the story is out to make. They might also do well to remember that David Fincher has a penchant for the atypical, non-Hollywood ending; if 'Se7en', 'Zodiac' and 'The Social Network' left you pining for endings that were more 'Hollywood hero', climactic and conclusive respectively...then perhaps 'Gone Girl' isn't for you either. You are warned.I did consider what it would have been like had I NOT read the book beforehand and came to this conclusion: You get to experience this story once fully, and after that once, it will never have the same impact. If you choose to read it first, you will admire the movie's smarts; if you choose to watch the film first, you are likely to have one of the most gleefully discombobulating cinema experiences you'll have had for a long time! Of course, I wish I could say more, but as you know, I can't. Bottom line is this: Love or hate Fincher, there is no questioning his craft or the fact this is one of his best moments. Whether you love or hate 'Gone Girl', there is no denying it is one of the most audacious, carefully crafted, if not, in your opinion, best films of the year.",9,0,6,29 October 2014
Insidious," Should have been so much better!
","I thoroughly enjoyed 'Saw'; it was suspenseful and fun; James Wan was almost Hitchcockian in his approach. To an extent I enjoyed its sequel, and this would be thanks to Leigh Wannell, who starred in them, but doesn't ever seem to receive much recognition for the writing. It should have ended there, but what are you going to do, the market is what it is, right? Given that 'Insidious' sees the two guys back together, and after the rather lacklustre 'Paranormal Activity 2' and the torture porn of late, I was looking forward to a film that would provide a rare opportunity to enjoy some intelligent and genuinely frightening psychological terror. To an extent, they succeed.First the good. Credit must go to the film for some great casting; I'm a big fan of Patrick Wilson (see 'Hard Candy' and even 'The A-Team' for evidence of his ability) and Rose Byrne, who are great as this perfect couple, and very busy character actress Lin Shaye ('A Nightmare On Elm Street', 'My Sister's Keeper' and 'Snakes On A Plane' to name a few of many!) has great screen presence. The problem is they are under the direction of somebody whose intention with the film falters halfway through, meaning they find themselves either doing things that do not make sense, seem silly and absurd, or worst of all, they are wasted by being given very little to do; this is a particularly bad crime when you have someone in your film with as much to give as Barbara Hershey ('Black Swan').Wan and Whannell spend pretty much the first half of the movie providing a haunted house setup; the initial haunting, the house move (not really a spoiler, given that the trailer TOLD us what the twist of the story is), and the events that take you to the pivotal point of the film are all done very slowly; some would argue a bit too slowly, but it's good to see him taking his time with the creepy setup. Not since 'The Exorcist' has there been a horror movie I can think of that has been paced in this way; it causes a restlessness in the audience, and a desire to want the story to push forward, which of course heightens your anticipation and makes you more uncomfortable. Wan is very good at the classic vibe; he actually manages to do what 'Paranormal Activity' did, but better. He tips his hat to many other classic of the genre, a bit too heavily at points, but it remains very solid and creepy.This only emphasises the disappointment we feel when the film reaches the part of explaining what has happened, and sets up what will occur in the second half. Whether it was Whannell's choice to change gear, or instruction from on high to get away from the 'Paranormal Activity' similarities (same producing team), we can't know, but whoever's it was, they should regret it. The explanation of things feels like a bad re-working of 'Poltergeist', and the previously scary techniques are replaced with ham-fisted effects and dodgy makeup. Too much is shown, and due to the look of certain aspects of the piece, it starts to become a bit laughable; the on screen events becomes sillier and sillier, and we reach a point where the tone becomes one of 'creepy computer game', rather than 'scary horror film'. There is an introduction of comedy into the film that is completely uncalled for and though genuinely funny, the jokes could not be more out of place; they ruin all the atmosphere that has been created, and you know it is going downhill. This is also the point where we have stopped being scared, and this is a problem for any horror film, hurtling towards its final act with the audience having been lost some time ago.Speaking of the final act, it is just absurd, and in thinking about the film afterwards, you begin to realise just how many loose ends there are, how many plot holes are left open, and then the question of whether it is all for the sake of a sequel comes to mind. Given that 'Paranormal Activity' had one, it is hard to imagine them not pushing for one here, which is a shame, because this should have been the brilliant, one-off psychological terroriser the first half promised so heartily, and not the silly theme park walk-through it becomes.All this said, James Wan has some talent, as he has proved, and I will not give up on him just yet. Worth seeing on the big screen, in a room full of people for some of the jump-scares, but otherwise, 'Insidious' is one to rent.",4,5,11,8 May 2011
The Elephant Man," My current best film of all time
","The story of John Merrick, to much shock and surprise, was beautifully told by the master of the surreal, David Lynch. From the stunning cinematography and music, to the performances that drive it, this is a flawless Lynchian masterpiece; his cinematic fingerprints remain visible, though his reverence for the story outlaws any of the more heavyweight surrealist indulgence one might expect. A deeply compassionate film, but never overly sentimental; never begging for you to pity the man, but rather to understand and respect him, and the people who came to know and love him. A final scene that knocks me sideways every time with its calm, understated style, set to the aching 'Adagio for Strings', more often associated with 'Platoon'. Top-notch, intelligent film making that is hard to beat!",10,0,0,1 January 2011
The Hurt Locker," The masterpiece they say it is? No. Great film? Yes!
","Jeremy Renner is the man! I thought I would get that out there to start with, just to emphasise how much he brings to 'The Hurt Locker'. If Sgt William James had been played by somebody with less presence of character, the film would not have worked anywhere near as well, despite what other praise one could give it.Sgt First Class William James steps in to lead a bomb disposal team in Iraq; they have only a month left on their rotation, but the loss of their previous leader, Sgt Thompson, has left them shaken, with a gap that seems hard to fill. Sgt James's methods and general view of his job seem to Sgt Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge to be irresponsible and dangerous; this does little for Sanborne's requirement for order and discipline, and is especially threatening to the fragile Eldridge, who is already talking regularly with Colonel Cambridge, the group psychiatrist.Not unlike 'Jarhead' in its approach, it features very little violence for a war film, and no elements of what one might think of as 'machoism' whatsoever. The whole thing focuses fully on the psychology of these men who step out every day ready to die, 'rolling the dice', as Sanborne says in a key scene. Even one moment which does involve them volunteering themselves to each others physical violence is not actually about the macho violence, but about what is going on between the characters, the dynamic shifts occurring within the team, and how they view each other; in this regard, the scene brought to mind 'Fight Club'. There are numerous parts that rely on subtext, or on the audience's ability to read between the lines of what is being said and recognise that this is a character piece, not a 'wham bam' action movie. One central scene in particular has a lot going on with very little dialogue; this is the nature of the film in general, asking us to recognise what is not being said as well as what is, and to pay close attention to the characters' interaction.The film does not adhere to conventions very much; it is shot in a way that is suggestive of a documentary, with a feeling of not so much telling a story, but rather following a set of events. That said, it is cinematic, with some scenes where performance and subtle, clever use of sound ratchet up the tension very well. It is an unusual feeling, and it takes the first act of the film for us to get completely comfortable with the groove. Once we are, however, it makes for a notably unique experience, and the fact we are focusing on a group of guys that other war films have never really looked at only adds to the freshness.As for criticisms, there are people such as David Morse, Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes in this movie, but they border on 'blink and you miss them' roles, which is a shame. It could also be argued that when all is said and done, it does not feel like the film, for all its accolades, is really saying that much beyond its opening quotation; contrary to the hyperbole surrounding it, it is not a film trying to set the world on fire; it does not have any obvious political stance, it is not 'anti-war', it is simply an exciting look at the psychology of the men we follow. There is a section of the last act of the film where it feels like the whole thing drops a gear, but it picks it back up again for a great ending, in which the look on Renner's face, and the final shot as Bigelow brings in a track by the band Ministry to introduce the credits, perfectly underlines the point of Sgt James's final monologue! Not the astounding masterpiece some people might have had us think, and certainly not 'the best war movie ever made', but very, very good.",8,1,3,6 April 2011
Million Dollar Baby," Perfect
","Clint Eastwood is simply a master, and of all his directorial achievements, this for me is the sweetest of the bunch. A film adapted from a short story and fleshed out to be something so much more incredible, and which blindsided everybody as a great deal more than 'just another sports movie'. The story is told with so much cinematic swagger it should be illegal; it is perfectly paced, with not a frame wasted.Clint and Morgan Freeman work as well as two masters should, to the extent that you could watch every scene with just them and simply enjoy the banter of the characters they create. Hilary Swank impresses, and together with 'Boys Don't Cry', this performance shows that when given the chance, she can go toe-to-toe with the best and stand her ground.The whole thing is beautifully played out; it is intelligent, surprisingly emotional, and finds its way into your heart. Literally a perfect film.",10,1,2,2 January 2011
Evil Dead," Well made but forgettable
","As with most of these remakes nowadays, it is not to say they are not better made films, but they are often not a touch on the original. Evil Dead lacks a lot of what made Raimi's film so legendary; it lacks a lot of the humour, it contains scenes that don't really hang together, characters who aren't much more than fodder and whose decisions don't always make a whole lot of sense. Some of the editing in places is more messy than need be and it is ultimately a bit forgettable. This is not to say, however, that it is not gleefully, wilfully gory fun, not to mention, at times, quite an exciting experience. A mixed bag; best rented.",5,0,7,14 May 2013
Prisoners," Grim, gripping, great performances. Not a masterpiece.
","Aaron Guzikowski's screenplay for 'Prisoners' was near the top of the list of best unmade for quite some time; at one point Hugh Jackman was attached to the project, but dropped out for reasons that remain unclear, though scheduling conflict may not be quite as pertinent as a lack of artistic cohesion with the original director. As serendipity would have it, the much later arrival of Denis Villeneuve as director, to his first English language feature, drew a mega cast of great talent, both in front of and behind the camera, including Jackman again. This is presumably based on the acknowledgement of his previous Award-nominated work. With Villeneuve on board, the screenplay seemed destined to become so much more than your average abduction thriller; to a great extent this fact is both the strength, and arguably the weakness of the final product.The straightforward setup is of two quite different but friendly families whose daughters go missing after Thanksgiving dinner. When the detective assigned to the case apprehends a suspect and finds no evidence of any crime with which to charge him, he has no choice but to release him. The subsequent act of the film follows the predictable route of a father taking the law into his own hands, and raises important questions about the morality and effectiveness of torture, the dangers of all actions and judgements, right or wrong, being governed by instinct and not logic, and the most obvious: What would you do, and where would YOU draw the line? The final act reaches a little too hard for a 'Gotcha!' finale, which may disappoint those who did not want to see it become a more generic thriller, but it does not undermine the movie too badly. 'Prisoners' is beautifully shot by the man responsible for some of the best looking films you can name, Roger Deakins. Much as with the late Conrad L. Hall, you can sense that every shot took forever to setup, but the result always justifies that time. With a constantly gritty, doom-laden tone, one really cannot help but keep thinking of David Fincher; with the inclusion of Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki, it is near impossible not to recall 'Zodiac'. There has been much made of Hugh Jackman's powerhouse performance as the angry Keller Dover, and there is no doubt his intensity is spot-on, but for me, Gyllenhaal actually quietly steals the show with a perfectly-pitched performance as a dog-tired, stressed detective who can feel his grip on the case gradually slipping; I don't think he has been better.The film is paced with a deliberately painful slowness; its moments of tension and excitement are highlighted as quite so intense by virtue of their brevity. This is a story of depth, with a lot to digest and discuss on every level. The thoughtful watcher will, upon reflection, come to realise nothing in the film is irrelevant; as Detective Loki himself says, 'Everything matters.' The twists and turns in the final act build on the idea at the heart of the film, with the title growing increasingly relevant; this encourages deeper thought than your more average thriller. Something rather fascinating about the direction is that from quite early, a lot of the audience will already know HOW the film will end; it is HOW it gets there which might take most by surprise!'Prisoners' isn't a movie you enjoy so much as admire; incredibly artful, it is more a film of ideas and thinking points. It may be possible to pick little holes in the procedural elements, but it remains a challenging piece that will probably benefit from repeat viewing. Due to the fact everything ties up well, it is not as hole-riddled as a casual viewer may think, although that is not to say that, as it heads into more generic 'Fincher' territory, it does not become a little too convoluted for its own good; certainly there is little doubt the film is at its strongest as the tense, slow examination of a controversial topic. Despite the contrivances, the fact that it is, at times, more heavy-handed than it need be, and that Terrence Howard, Viola Davis and Melissa Leo are given frustratingly little to do, 'Prisoners' nevertheless remains a piece of work which demands attention and respect for the film making.It would certainly be unjust to say this isn't one of the films of the year, and I definitely sense an Oscar for the cinematography here.",8,2,4,26 October 2013
The Happening," What the hell is this?
","After the soaring success and near hysteria over 'The Sixth Sense', a hysteria I didn't think it worthy of I might add, M. Night Shyamalan has failed to achieve the same level of success with subsequent efforts. I think it fair to say, however, that with each one he has gradually succeeded in becoming one of the most frustrating directors in the history of cinema. His initial ideas aren't at all bad (on the contrary, the ideas for his films tend to be rather compelling), but I have become rather accustomed to the fact that he nearly always drops the ball, the only variable from one film to the next being when this is going to happen. I say nearly, because in fairness 'Signs' was a pretty well-crafted, gripping piece of work, albeit with a rather tenuous conclusion.It turns out, with 'The Happening', the ball is dropped rather quickly, and never really gets picked up again. It opens well enough, the first five minutes throwing us straight into the bizarre events, and fully achieves the intended audience reaction of, 'What is going on?' Then we're back to that frustration, with our attention very quickly being drawn to other issues, like the misjudged pacing, the 'made for television' shooting style, the clunky dialogue that is often nothing more than plot exposition, and the pastiche performances that appear to have actually been directed to be as hammy and obvious as possible, because you don't get this level of awful by accident.Even if an actor isn't particularly great, it takes a special talent to draw a performance from them that is as plastic as the plant they end up talking to. Mark Wahlberg is a perfectly competent actor; he won't be winning any 'Best Actor' Oscars anytime soon, but it is fair to say he serves his purpose in a film, so you have to wonder how on earth it is that every line he delivers is stilted and unreal. At first I wondered if it was his discomfort with the material, but quickly realised this phenomenon applied to pretty much the entire cast; actors you recognise as good at what they do, looking completely out of their depth, a very strange experience.A big issue I very quickly had with 'The Happening' was the nasty sense I got of being patronised, and it even reached a point where I genuinely wondered if Shyamalan had decided with this film to do nothing more than make fun of his audience. As is nearly always the case, he develops ideas far above his station, and his view of himself as a visionary and hugely clever director gets the better of him. The problem being that this time, I suspect even he got lost in the ideas. With plot points and explanations (or lack thereof) being contradictory, it begins to feel as though he really never knew how he was going to resolve what he had set up in the first place, and so resorted to making it up as he went along. He ends up relying on the sound-bite that 'we'll never really know everything', and expects that to be an acceptable coat hook on which to hang any unaddressed issue. This film does not give license for that, and the result is that he simply loses your trust.So was there anything I liked? As I say, the premise is good, and the score works as best as it can with such an awful set of images. Note to director: Attempting to personify the wind with 'dramatic' shots of fields is not innovative, it's just stupid! After films like 'Unbreakable', 'The Village' and 'Lady in the Water', all of which hit a different level of failure, you would think he would begin to accept he is simply an 'ideas man', eat some humble pie, and pass all future thoughts on to somebody who can actually turn his ideas, which are more often than not perfectly fine unto themselves, into good pieces of cinema. Of course he doesn't! Instead, we get 'The Happening', with Shyamalan once again doing everything (writing, producing and directing), and once again messing it up very badly! Better luck next time.",2,18,32,6 January 2011
It's a Wonderful Life," The ultimate in feel-good
","Upon first inspection it is easy perhaps to understand why when first released, Frank Capra's Christmas movie, inspired by a simple seasonal card, was not well received. It is a movie that opens with a fantastical scene of a star, later revealed to be an angel, talking to a faceless God, the voice-over obvious, stilted in sweet humour, and immediately suggesting the film is going to be one that is too saccharine a pill to swallow. The thing is, beyond that, 'It's A Wonderful Life' is the ultimate exercise in feel-good cinema, its virtue as such much parodied and referenced in TV and other films.The film presents George Bailey, played by James Stewart who would go on to refer to the film as his own favourite, who stifles his lifelong dreams of travelling and discovery in order to save and run his father's Building And Loan Association. It has long been responsible for the affordable housing in his hometown Bedford Falls and he cannot see it lost to the scoundrel of the piece, Henry F. Potter, who is a major shareholder in the Building And Loan and the only man residents could otherwise turn to. After a run at the bank leaves the Building And Loan on the brink of financial ruin, and George's Uncle Billy misplaces $8000, in an act of desperation he attempts suicide, at which time he is saved by the angel Clarence. Understandably confused, he wishes he had never been born, and so his wish is granted.If the plot seems familiar even though you have not seen 'It's A Wonderful Life', it is probably because you saw the idea loosely re-worked in the Nicolas Cage film 'The Family Man'. For all its up to date technique, its colour, modern setting, etc, this version could not capture what made the original.So, what did make the original? What could surprise people is how Capra clearly believed in the notion that you have to suffer the low to get the high. The second act of the movie gets really quite dark, with Bailey seeing what the world would be like without his birth, coming to understand just how important a person is to everybody else's existence, and bringing him to a full appreciation of his worth as a husband, father and friend. The finale is obviously that classic scene that we all know, even if we do not realise it, with his daughter's famous, 'Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings', and despite how much you might think the whole thing sounds cheesy, silly, saccharine and sentimental, the power of the film is to bring a genuine tear of pure enjoyment to your eye regardless; for a while you are full of the joy of life and completely happy, no matter what.A lot of the film's success comes down to how believable James Stewart makes the plight, and for any flaws you may find with it, its colourful characters, its tremendous performances, humour, heartbreaking moments, perfectly pitched highs and lows, and its' unabashed final sequence make this an inexplicably perfect film.No wonder it remains at the top spot of many people's favourite Christmas films, and so it should.",10,1,2,16 February 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," If you know what to expect, it's very good
","The main hot political potato that has arisen with the film is the subject of whether or not it champions torture, and whether it was, in this case, successful or not as a means to obtain information. For me, there are two very straightforward things to say on the matter. Firstly, and backing up my feeling that the film maker remains at a moral remove from the subject, I am not entirely sure what the people who are upset about it wanted; torture occurred regardless of our feelings about it, and as Bigelow has pointed out, to not depict this part of the story would be dishonest. Secondly, the very fact there is a raging debate as to whether the movie does or does not champion its use is evidence, in itself, that it does not make it a clean-cut, black and white case. Unlike other reviews, I will not spoil the movie by mentioning the crux of a key plot point in relation to the matter, but it could be well argued that the film remains deliberately neutral on it. Boal and Bigelow put the subject out there for debate, seemingly playing devil's advocate in terms of their own feelings; I suspect they felt it would be wrong to imprint their personal stance on a film such as this.This film is larger in scope than The Hurt Locker, but they actually share a lot of DNA; both are timely works about the war, and both are notable for examining the psychology of their central character, the big difference being that one film is set in the midst of the hot zone and about a group dynamic, while the other shows us a war which becomes almost personal, and is fought from behind a desk. Where The Hurt Locker had the freedom afforded it by not being based on a set of events, Zero Dark Thirty adheres very strictly to a specific set of events, namely the zig, zags and frustrating dead ends that were the decade-long hunt for the world's most wanted terrorist.This is, at once, a strength and a weakness of the movie; the film focuses on detailing one event after another, with a cold precision and little character development. Thankfully, the movie is crafted in such a way that, despite knowing how it ends, as with Apollo 13, we find ourselves gripped by the details of the hows, whys and wherefores. Nevertheless, whilst the who's who of a cast all give believable performances, there is generally the sense that you are simply a fly on the wall, not getting to know these people, but rather watching things play out, in the moment. There are two exceptions to this, one being Dan, the expert in 'enhanced interrogation techniques', who in another context you feel you could like. He is played by the fantastic Jason Clarke, previously of Lawless; his lack of nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars is a huge oversight. The other is Maya herself; Chastain plays a woman who does not give much away, and so it is understandable that, to some, her performance seems flat, and certainly not worthy of her Oscar nomination. I will not say she deserves to win it, but I definitely disagree that it is a flat performance; on the contrary, she actually has some rather amusing and deftly written dialogue, which is a pleasant surprise, and I find the subtle shifts in her character's psychology, the growth of her obsession, even in the face of people telling her to let it go, to be one of the most compelling elements of the film.And it is on her performance the film takes its final bow; Zero Dark Thirty goes out, not with a bang, but on a downbeat. The final half hour of the movie is a well-executed, realistic depiction of the raid of the house and the killing of Osama, and yet we miss the drama of the preceding two hours. Could this be the point? Maya's tears and final exhalation are of what? Relief or joy? She's not smiling. Sadness? Understanding of loss? Perhaps it is something not so easily captured in just one word or phrase, but one things is for sure, you know you are looking at a character who, like us, found that the chase became more important than the objective, and only now has come to realise that the last decade of her life has yielded nothing; no friends, no love, no family, no real home, nothing but one man's death. At one point in the movie, upon being asked what she has done for the CIA other than this, she has to answer: 'Nothing, I have done nothing else.' You do not leave this film, with its quiet closing credit score, feeling at ease or like it celebrates anything, other than perhaps the bravery of the men who put their life on the line for an important job; the movie actually leaves us with an unexpected feeling of hollowness. This is a thoughtful movie, put together by somebody who understands it is not a simple subject to relay; it doesn't tell the audience what to think, and there are those who might not like or admit that. Those of the general public passing judgement on a subject about which they know little, especially when they have not even bothered to see the film, are, I believe, bandwagon jumpers who like the sound of their own, mostly ill-informed ramblings, and who should perhaps see the film first.",8,5,10,1 February 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," Scorsese gets ballsy again
","After a flight into 'general audience' land with the excellent 'Hugo', Martin Scorsese collaborates for a fifth time with the ever more dependable Leo DiCaprio, playing his second real life figure for the legendary film maker. Jordan Belfort came from nothing and built a Wall Steet empire like a true Gordon Gekko by, essentially, screwing over any sucker he could. The man did time, paid his dues, wrote a confessional, cautionary tale, and now performs sales seminars. None of this is spoiler; assuming you are at all interested in the topic, this should be unsurprising knowledge. It is also par for the course with this sort of Scorsese movie; you've seen the 'rise and fall' riff from him a few times before now, right? For the actor, everything he touches turns to gold right now; here he gives what is probably his most energetic performance, often invoking a young Jack Nicholson. Certainly an extraordinary, extended sequence involving the results of a narcotics overdose is due to be considered classic in no time! For Scorsese, the obvious touchstone here is 'Goodfellas'; the style of building momentum and 'bad guy' narration is back, but again, the gangster epic remains the superior film. For both men as a team, 'The Aviator' is their obvious high point.That said, there is much to be admired here: The excellent look of the film, the superb performances from Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey, the latter of whom only has about ten minutes screen time but leaves a huge impression; the fantastic use of music, again reminding us of Scorsese's ability to compose excellent montages, which drive us forward without much plot, and a masterful ability to turn the tone of the film on a dime, if only for a moment. This latter point results in unexpected laughs and gasps of disbelief; a sense of comedy arises from what is frequently a simultaneously rather obscene and absurd set of circumstances and behaviour, which leave you feeling quite horrified and/or disgusted.On the downside, there is no excuse for its length and, toward the end, an upset rhythm. Up to a point we are completely on board, but as the film enters its third hour and is only then truly exploring the repercussions of Jordan's actions, along with his humiliation, we become painfully aware that with some more intelligent and brutal editing, there was probably a good forty-five minutes of the previous couple of hours that could have been easily expunged, leaving room for more of the final act and bringing it in at an easy 135 minutes. Perhaps we should turn to Leo as producer here and ask, 'Why didn't you say no to a three hour cut of this?' 'The Wolf...' asks for a lot of investment in a set of characters it is pretty tough to care much for, and with ultimately little reward. The film is an impressive effort, and undoubtedly Scorsese's most ballsy film for some time, but it is also disappointing; looking at his career, we all know that this should have been a five star film! The sense that this master of cinema could have done a bit better is not easily ignored. Nevertheless, there is enough here to make it worth your while when it leaves the cinema.",7,2,4,29 January 2014
The Wrestler," He just keeps going...
","If you are familiar with Darren Aranofsky's previous work, the visual style of 'The Wrestler' is rather disarming; I was surprised to find the film was shot hand-held, with only occasional scenes in which the camera remains completely stationary. This gives the whole film an energy, which you might expect with the inevitable action scenes, but is really quite fresh when it comes to what happens outside of the ring.Given how much craft we're used to seeing on the screen when it comes to this director, you would never guess this is by the man responsible for 'The Fountain'. Here, we get a lot of scenes where it does not feel like much has been planned so far as camera angles or technical craft is concerned. Takes have been left untouched in the editing process, and the camera is often simply following Rourke's character, 'The Ram', opening up the room the characters are in, and letting the performances be the star. With all this taken into account, it is fair to say that 'The Wrestler' displays the least directing talent from Aranofsky, but only in that you really feel he has put his 'director ego' aside, and has trusted the film to work this way.The draw of the film is the human-ness of it, the emotion, the simple story of a wrestler who was once at the top of his game, has long since fallen, and who is now trying to reconcile his wrecked relationship with his daughter, and find some sort of happiness outside of the ring. To have messed around with artifice would have somehow detracted from the soul of the film, which is the events on screen and quite simply, the acting.That said, there is some subtle musical scoring from Clint Mansell, which is sparse, but it is really great when it delivers. The actors had not met before filming some of their scenes, so there was a real sense with the heaviest moments in the film that there had been no rehearsal; they are raw, improvised to some degree, and allowed to be as natural as they can be. Evan Rachel Wood, who I developed quite an admiration for when I saw 'Thirteen', gives it all, and whether you agree with her choices and actions, or not, it doesn't take away from her believability one bit. Isabella Rossellini is unrecognisable as Joe Pesci's girlfriend in 'My Cousin Vinny'; she is subtle and natural as the stripper with whom 'The Ram' wants to develop some relationship beyond that of a customer.'Witness the resurrection of Mickey Rourke', they said. Much was made of the physical performance, but I would suggest this wasn't the stretch many imagined; Rourke was a boxer and is not unfamiliar with the gym environment. The real strength of his acting here is in playing the man. This film reminds you that before he threw it all away, he was a great screen actor and there is no doubt that this, strangely, is the role his life has dictate that he play. It could only be Rourke for the role of 'The Ram'. When he first received the script, he was disappointed, because as a boxer he had always looked down on wrestling, but he asked Aronofsky to allow him to make it personal, to change the character's lines to reflect his own experiences: his dialogue in the film are things he has said, the situations are ones he has been in, and you can really sense that in a genuine and heart rending performance. When 'The Ram' makes his speech (you know it when you see the film), it is not 'The Ram', it is Mickey Rourke. I am very glad to see him given the opportunity to make a comeback, and I look forward to seeing him move forward and make the most of what most professionals don't get, a second chance! It is quite right to say you DO NOT have to be particularly keen on wrestling to enjoy the film, as it is far more about the story of the man than his work in the ring, much like 'Raging Bull' not being about boxing, or 'Remember The Titans' not being an American football film. It should still be stressed, however, that due to the nature of the filmmaking and some of the content, this may not appeal to everyone, but if you want to see Rourke giving an unexpectedly wonderful performance, or you're an Aranofsky fan, it's definitely a must! Very oddly, I would say don't expect to enjoy it simply on the basis you're a wrestling fan, as that is not necessarily going to be the case.I admire the film for venturing into the murky waters of drug and steroid use, that it didn't shy away from the grittier side of the lifestyle these athletes choose, and I raise my hat to Aronofsky for how he chose to close it; the final scene is definitely a highlight of the movie. It is also one from which you get more beautiful detail and moving performance than you expect, if you're watching it closely and not concentrating more on your pizza. In this whole final scene, there are a few moments that really got to me, just one being when we hear his music after a pause, calling to him. And just watch Rourke, you get to see him fly in this closing scene! Together with Mansell's score, which I mentioned earlier, it makes for a stunning bit of cinema.If I have any complaint, it is only that I would have liked to have seen more scenes that developed the relationships between the people further, and told a bit more of an elaborate story in this area, because it is in these scenes I do feel the film is at its strongest and most memorable! But this is a small qualm overall.",8,0,0,1 January 2011
Inception," Where to from here?
","Christopher Nolan really is proving himself to be one of the greatest directors of his generation, and certainly the best to come out of the UK for some time, by a long stretch! There simply isn't a flaw to this film; it's perfectly thought out and planned, and looks amazing, with a visual wizardry that is meant to support the clever idea, rather than replace it. Having Hans Zimmer on board meant the music was going to be nothing short of pitch perfect, with the score really stands out as a major character in the film.Nolan's attention to detail is astonishing, and his ability to keep a vast, complex vision held together in a well paced film, without any obvious stumbles along the way, means parallels with Kubrick, Lynch or Hitchcock are not unfair to draw. I also don't envy his editor, Lee Smith; with the density of this material, keeping it flowing with perfect continuity made it immediately Oscar worthy! Another film to which you can return over and over and see new things, and which at no point patronises the audience, or checks if you're keeping up. Some say it is complicated, but I don't think it is, so long as you watch and listen; 'Inception' demands a lot of you, but rewards the audience's attention greatly.Nolan may well have outdone himself, and after movies like 'Memento' and 'The Prestige', I remain curious and excited about what he will offer us next, beyond the next 'Batman' of course! Whatever it is, at this rate I certainly don't foresee Nolan expecting us to leave our brains at the entrance of the cinema in the near future.",10,0,7,1 January 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," Life-changing, life-affirming
","Incredible to think that, like 'It's A Wonderful Life', this film did not do well when it was released. The name, plus the fact it is a prison movie, plus the heavyweight tag-line, just didn't capture people's imagination. With its release on video and word-of-mouth, something changed, and now it is widely considered one of the greatest films of all time.The reason is simple: from start to finish, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is about as close to perfect as a film like this comes. The best adaption Frank Darabont has made from a Stephen King story, despite a couple of liberties taken (most notably, Red is not a black American, but a white Irishman in King's original), the whole thing works so well, you would not change a single detail! It is crafted impeccably; every scene is a masterpiece, and the performance from every single person involved is spot-on. An epic tale that works on any level you want it to; a simple prison drama, an examination of political corruption, a religious allegory, and so much in between; like 'Lord Of The Rings', the metaphor is practically endless.Perhaps it is because of this fact that so many people return to this film; it doesn't matter what time of life you see it, what you are going through, or how you choose to accept the film, it will always offer you something. That really is quite special. A story of hope that can be genuinely life-changing, and life-affirming. A gem of a movie",10,0,0,2 January 2011
Lucy," Unexpectedly thrilling
","Entering the latest Luc Besson offering, I was cynical, but to my own surprise, the film won me over! Yes, there are logic gaps, a cliché use of Morgan Freeman and perhaps an over-simplification of the idea, but 'Lucy' drives home with visual invention, a notable, pumping score by Eric Serra and sharp, fast paced editing; the effect frequently being that we feel, like our typically tough female lead, as though we are on some mad drug ourselves. Drawing on some of his own best previous work, Besson puts together a film with a feeling, at times, not unlike a solid Manga adaption, ala 'The Edge Of Tomorrow'. Also, a fun little aside that is most welcome, now I think about it, is a not-so-subtle tip of the hat to Korean classic 'Oldboy', with Min-sik Choi himself playing the villain Mr Jang with relish! It is easy to ignore the obvious liberties taken with the science, because the film is quite clearly not trying to be seen as accurate; you can also overlook the lack of character development, or indeed any real narrative meat, because once again, Besson knows exactly what he is looking to make here. Much like its own thesis on how human beings interpret the universe, 'Lucy' is a big idea scaled down. It is not as original or fresh as one might have hoped, and it does have its stumbles, but once you're over the hurdles, it proves to be a more-exciting-than-expected, well-built, high-octane thrill ride, which is most worthy of ninety minutes of your time.",7,5,12,26 August 2014
Flight," Turbulent
","Denzel Washington plays Captain Whip Whitaker, a pilot who crash lands a plane in a way that, it is later proved, nobody else would even consider, let alone be able to execute successfully (it really is genius!); he saves almost everybody on board, and becomes a hero. How was he able to keep his head, while all around him were losing theirs, and perform this heroic and seemingly impossible feat? Was it being the expert pilot he is, or was his ingenuity and gutsy handling of the situation a result of being hopped up on cocaine, and enough alcohol to make driving a car illegal? Is his irresponsible action forgivable by virtue of the fact that, had he not been there, everybody would have died? This is the conundrum the movie explores, and it even ponders the possibility of higher power, divine guidance, and bigger plans than we can imagine for those in need. The latter theme may prove too lofty for some of the audience, and there are a couple of points, I must confess, where I felt it was a bit heavy-handed with the subject. Then again, it is a trait that seems to appeal to Zemeckis and so should come as little surprise; consider previous work such as The Polar Express, Forrest Gump and Cast Away. This, however, is not the only area that will feel familiar to Zemickis fans; the airplane disaster sequence is a few notched more frantic, bone-rattling and tense than the one we saw in Cast Away. It is also possibly the best sequence of its kind that I have ever seen, and I saw Peter Weir's Fearless, which says a lot! After this incredible opening it becomes a psychological drama, a character study of a man with a problem. It was always going to be hard for the film to maintain its engagement level, but much like the plane, the second act does suffer more turbulence than I expected; Zemeckis certainly appears, at points, to be unable to marshal it all quite as well as has done previously. This is not to say there are not many terrific scenes and performances, indeed the film is performance driven, but there is no getting around the fact that some elements are mismanaged. A scene in which the co-pilot and his wife preach about God's plan for Whip comes off as a bit too humorous for the piece. John Goodman turns up a couple of times in a role which I would have dialled down a notch and developed more.Other characters are underused, and relationships not given as much fleshing out as might have been helpful in adding dramatic weight; a great example here would be the flight attendant Margaret, who really should have had more screen time. Nicole, played by Kelly Reilly of Eden Lake and Sherlock Holmes fame, is a perfectly fine character who should have worked a bit like Marisa Tomei in The Wrestler, but unfortunately never has that sort of impact. The hour or so after the crash almost outstays its welcome by meandering a bit too much, which is ironic, given that there was a lot of under-developed story here. This is a shame, as there is a notable gear change for the final act of the movie, and we suddenly find ourselves back in a film that could have been flying high the whole way, had it been a bit more focused, and I daresay shorter.All of this said, however, the most important element of Flight is the story and the arc of Captain Whitaker; casting the right man for the job was absolutely crucial to selling this whole thing. Washington reminds us, possibly for the first time since Training Day, how good he is at presenting not simply a good or bad guy, and not somebody we can easily say we like or dismiss, but rather the flawed human being. The heart of drama is conflict and this film is full of the stuff for all concerned, but most notably and interestingly, for us the audience. The study of the psychology of a man who will not, or cannot, face up to his demons is always compelling, and here we are brought to a point where we care about Whitaker, we want to see him redeemed.Washington hits his highs and lows brilliantly, taking us with him; we find ourselves genuinely happy, and sincerely disappointed with him in equal measure, as we watch him struggle, wanting desperately to jump in and help him. It is a master actor who can get us to this point, and it is in fact mainly he, not the director, who pulls us through the muddy middle of the movie. The final forty minutes is a compelling performance, and the penultimate chapter showcases nothing short of a masterclass in acting. The finale of the story has been foreshadowed for some time through the film, we are ready and waiting for it, and so the fact Washington is still able to move us quite so intensely is a pleasant final lift. His delivery proves that the devil is in the details; there is no 'Hollywood-ing' here, it is absolutely real, and as we watch him we see the quiet, subtle perfection that makes him worthy of his nomination.Flight doesn't maintain its occasionally breathtaking altitude as consistently as I would have liked, but its star, and the phenomenal acts that sandwich a bloated middle, elevate it from the generic and make it one to watch.",6,1,2,6 February 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An Opus
","Whilst some may argue it is over-long, 'The Return Of The King' is simply too powerful, with too many wonderful elements, and is ultimately too great an achievement to not be in my list of favourite films of all time! Peter Jackson's adaption of this story, whilst having the occasional stumble along the way, was ultimately stunning. This film ties up the themes of the previous two instalments, of which there are many, in an emotional tour de force, on a rather grand scale. When you have performances from a top-notch cast, in a film about ideas as fundamentally moving as this, you are hardly going to go wrong, and at the centre of it all is the friendship between Frodo and Sam, so brilliantly played by Elijah Wood and Sean Austin.Friendship, loyalty, sacrifice, love, and the struggles we all face can be found committed to film in the intense few hours of 'The Return Of The King'. The reason Lord Of The Rings worked so well is that it did not become a stage for special effects (which are wonderful, as shown in scenes of battling with a giant spider); the story is always first! What is impressive is how, for an original story with such scope of themes and ideas to be explored, not much is really missed in the film, and it is so expertly adapted, one cannot fail to overlook any of the flaws purists might make a point of, and be simply overwhelmed by its power",10,0,1,2 January 2011
The Purge," Should have been better
","The idea is intriguing. For twelve hours a year all crime is legal, including murder; do what you want and face no consequence. All emergency services are suspended and with the exception of an unexplained restriction on weaponry, and certain members of the public being out of bounds as targets, there is nothing to stop you doing what you wish. The result is a venting of frustration and anger, a purging of demons, as well as the eradication of the poor and those unable to defend themselves. The end result of this annual purge is extremely low unemployment and crime, and a fantastic economy; 'a nation reborn', where the weak are prey and the strong survive. One of the strong is James Sandin, who sells security systems to fellow high-flyers; these obviously come in most useful on the night of the purge. Of course on the night in question, things go rather wrong and the Sandin family find their home under siege, following their son Max's generous act of letting a victimised stranger in.For a second, put aside the rather obvious holes in the idea when considered as a practise encouraged at a national level, even put aside the cynical nature of the movie, and we can see the idea may have started out as a distressing vision of a near future, a terrifying 'other reality'. Indeed, 'The Purge' takes its cue from a lot of previous work that has done similarly; you don't have to look too hard to see various elements of 'A Clockwork Orange', '1984', 'Lord of the Flies' and 'Battle Royale'. The problem is that unlike those works, and unlike 'Straw Dogs', with which it shares more than a little DNA, this story has been watered down to a locked room domestic thriller; a potentially incendiary political fable is devoid of most of that which would have made it so. This is actually typical of writer/director James DeMonaco, who is responsible for the screenplay for the remake of 'Assault on Precinct 13', a film which again extracted a lot of the original's rough edges and tough moments to leave a flat, action driven thriller. Similarly, the scope of the film is rather narrow; with early implication that there will be a study of repressed violence and how the night is used as an excuse, it is then disappointing to see the story steers frustratingly wide of all matters other than murder. The film lacks the gumption to tackle the disturbing elements of our unchecked nature in a way that Cronenberg would have done.So what we're looking at here is a film which, in different hands may have proved to be a controversial and stirring piece of work, but with DeMonaco scared to grasp the nettle, we end up with a flat, rather tame film, which is given some lift by its better elements, such as the performances and some of the fight sequences. Lacking bite, with a frustrating amount of exposition and not enough dissection of issues, 'The Purge' falls short of what it should have been.This is not to take away from Ethan Hawke's solid performance, or some of the more effective scenes, but what we would give to have seen this in the hands of Michael Haneke.",5,204,281,5 June 2013
Moon," Completely unexpected
","Sam Bell is a contract worker who, for three years, has been mining the moon for helium-3, the solution to Earth's energy crisis. He is nearing the end of his contracted time, and excited about getting home; for so long his only company has been that of video messages from his family, his photographs, and the on-board computer. Upon visiting one of the mining stations, Sam has an accident and finds himself waking at base, under the care of said computer, named Gerty. What then unfolds is something not very easily described without spoiling what makes the film so good, but it is fair to say that on more than one occasion, due to a lot of seemingly familiar tropes, you may believe you know where the film is going. You almost definitely don't. It is refreshing to see this sort of film take more than one turn along the way and become something you really are not expecting.Sam Rockwell has become one of many people's favourite actors now, a man who seems able to manifest physical transformation from one role to the next without the aid of effects. Put Rockwell from 'Frost/Nixon', 'Iron Man 2', and this film alongside each other, and you could almost believe they are different men! In 'Moon' he really does, perhaps more so than anywhere else, illustrate just how complex a performance he can give, and despite the other things about the film that I love, it is ultimately Rockwell on whom the film's success hinges. This is the performance at which, in time to come, people will likely look and wonder how it was that he didn't receive an Oscar nomination. Even Gerty was only voiced by Kevin Spacey after the man himself saw a rough cut, and was so impressed by the actor that he wanted to be part of the project. The great reception 'Moon' received was not only testament to the quality of Rockwell, of course, but also to that of first time film maker Duncan Jones (yes, 'Zowie Bowie'), who would go on to make 'Source Code', and is now pretty much finished with the daring project 'Warcraft'. 'Moon' is a fascinating, independently produced sci-fi which, unlike most entries in the genre, features no hi-tech, big-budget effects, monsters, or fancy trickery; it is just a good idea, great film making, one of Clint Mansell's most impressive scores, and a superb performance as its beating heart. Catch 'Moon' and it may well become one of your favourite movies.",10,2,7,11 February 2011
Her," A poignant piece
","Spike Jonze is known for his wild way or working, but despite the story's strangeness, this may be his most obviously focused and interesting film. Yes, it slows a little too much for the second act, there is a lack of back-story and development in the characters played by Rooney Mara and Olivia Wilde (one scene, and the most awkward one in the film at that, is surely a cameo?) and it certainly doesn't need to be over two hours. That's the bad.The good? With stunning photography, a heart rending score and a lead performance by Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore Twomble that is incredibly subtle and poignant (the actor seems to believe in quality over quantity of work; everything he does is solid), the film manages to overcome the flaws and deal well with an idea in a way that brings to mind the author J. G. Ballard. The architecture, the colour schemes, even Theodore's job, they are all geared for a story about modern man's cold distance, indifference and manufactured realities and emotions, only for the film to then delve into a story about the human need for closeness and love, exploring that emotion's sometimes painful complexity to the fullest, and taking an interesting look at sexual objectification at the same time.For a story that appears to be about a man interacting with a machine, the movie's moments of surprisingly emotional weight and its conclusion about love in human relationships make it properly engaging, with a compassion and humanity equal to the likes of another of the year's hits, 'Dallas Buyers Club'. Its tone and most bombastic moments mean it won't be for the less adventurous viewer, and it may be that not all relate to the 'lonely guy' element of the film, but this is certainly a more fascinating work than I would wager a lot of people imagine.",7,1,2,17 March 2014
The Great Gatsby," Not a classic, but there is a classic in here
","A far better adaption than I expected of one of the most important American novels, remaining very loyal, whilst undergoing an exciting, vibrant update that only Baz Luhrmann can execute. The set design, the art, the soundtrack, used rather tastefully and in a way that brings us right into Gatsby's world, making it relevant for today, without being obtrusive; Luhrmann manages to turn it all up as loud as it will go, but it doesn't become annoying. His reverence for the source is clearly in tact and when he needs to be restrained, he shows he isn't just style with no substance. In fact, his handle on the material is so strong that he brings out the melancholy of Fitzgerald's contemplation on this time in America rather beautifully; it is only in retrospect we see how prophetic and accurate the author's tragic metaphor was. The story is apparently simple, but like the book, the themes are complex and important; this is certainly a love story, but the examination of the mythical American dream, politics, power and money, greed and excess, the emptiness of high society and the corruption that material obsession and wealth brought to a post-war America on the verge of financial ruin remain well stated and strangely relevant. The poetry of the book is not lost; it is in fact enhanced, and at the most important moments, with a cinematic eloquence that almost rivals the written word.Yes, there are little things about it that don't work, there is a sense that Toby Maguire is not quite fitting, and it is a little too long, but this is a bold imagining with generally fantastic performances, notably from Joel Edgerton, who we barely recognize, and Carey Mulligan, who has the pleasure of delivering one of the most well known pieces of dialogue from the book and does so with a power that gives us goosebumps. Then, of course, the now ever dependable Leo, who nails exactly what Gatsby is on the page, and who has developed a talent for unexpected explosions to a level that few can currently reach.Not a classic piece of cinema, perhaps, but certainly one in which we can recognise an American classic.",8,0,2,21 May 2013
The Birds," Lightyears ahead
","Alfred Hitchcock was simply a master, and arguments can be had until Kingdom come as to which of his classics was the best, but at the end of the day it can only ever be subjective. I am aware that there is an argument for both 'Strangers On A Train' and 'Vertigo' as his best, but as much as I love theme, 'The Birds' is my favourite.I actually think the film itself sags a little in the front half, and I'm not a huge fan of Tippi Hedren, but that all falls away when you look at how brilliantly executed this film is. Technically, Hitchcock was light years ahead of his time, using a record number of trick-shots, and for such a dated film, the effects still look amazing, to the point where I wonder, 'How did he manage that?' Exciting filmmaking from a man who, if alive today, would still be showing the rest of them how it is done.",10,2,4,2 January 2011
