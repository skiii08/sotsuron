The Equalizer," Denzel's still got it!
","Without Denzel Washington, the 'save the girl from the mob plot,' frankly, would have been too much 'dejavu.' However, Denzel's charisma and ability to direct the viewers thoughts away from the plot & on to him saves the day!I thought it could of had a slice more of action in it. But, again, Denzel's knack for capturing your every thought on to what his next move is, keeps us in enough suspense to drown out the non-suspenseful foreknowledge of the plots next move. Director: Antoine Fuqua, does an excellent job of giving us just enough Denzel, to keep us wanting more...during the movie and after the movie is over. Besides, who can tire of Marton Csokas bad guy routine? He's always laid back & cool...creating the impression that he has more layers of ruthlessness then he really does. And last but not least, ChloÃ« Grace Moretz succeeds in making us all love hookers. I gave this movie a 6 for Denzel...the plot leaves more to be desired!",6,2,5,18 December 2014
