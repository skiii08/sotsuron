Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Worst Movie Ever!!! If you enjoy good sarcastic comedy... Family Guy... AVOID THIS ONE!
","The movie was stupid... I enjoy stupid humor too. He didn't go over the top, he didn't prove himself clever, he was very dry and lame. His accent gets annoying and sucks bigtime. The plot of the movie was stupid and anything remotely close to a story plot gets destroyed with intense boredom and hatred for this moronic man that tries waaayyy to hard to be funny. I will never watch anything with him in it again. He definitely thinks he is a lot funnier than he actually is... another huge annoyance in the movie; you get the feeling that he is enjoying himself all too much. I want those 2 hours back. Tom Green is funny in Freddy got Fingered, Jim Carrey is awesome in Liar Liar and Me Myself and Irene, Jackass can be hilarious, Dane Cook is a comedic genius, Family Guy is awesome, Simpsons suck because they try too hard... this listing was just to give you an idea of what sort of things I think are funny as a comparison to why I hated this film. All of I have to say is... wow Borat... I'm pretty sure that was the worst movie I've EVER seen... wow... not even remotely entertaining. Go straight to bed, now!",1,8,17,24 November 2006
