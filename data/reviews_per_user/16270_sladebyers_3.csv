It," Finally!
","Brilliant remake 27 years later. The child actors do a great job acting exactly like adolescent kids act. The new penny wise is portrayed well and the movie had some memorable scary moments. Anybody who says the original is better needs to rewatch it...it's horrible by today's standards. IT was one of the best movies of 2017, I can't wait until the sequel comes out.",9,1,2,14 November 2018
A Star Is Born," Good Remake
","I feel like this was a good movie for lady Gaga to debut her acting chops, Bradley Cooper is progessing well as a more serious actor and director. Overall it was a good drama with a tragically flawed character (Cooper) and a very sad ending.",7,0,3,14 November 2018
Point Break," The remake that shouldn't have happened
",As a huge fan of the original I was hesitant to watch the remake...for a reason. Quite possibly the worst remake ever made. Horrible acting and a lame story to boot. Eco warriors as the villains!? Come on man! Keanu Reeves would be ashamed...,3,0,0,24 May 2020
