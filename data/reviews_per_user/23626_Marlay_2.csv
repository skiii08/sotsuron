The Ring," You've got to be kidding me.
","This movie was garbage from the first minute to the very end.  I'm wondering how you sell something like this to an audience - it's a video tape that when you watch it, you die.  What ten-year-old came up with such a lame concept?  What's worse is that it leaves you with a ton of questions, it's not scary at all, and is overall pretty uninteresting.  Thumbs down!",4,1,2,16 May 2003
The Thin Red Line," I was bored
","This movie was a horrible waste of time. There really was no plot, as far as I could tell. For three hours, the US forces ran up Guadalcanal and shot at the Japanese forces. But there was little if any point. The star-studded cast was assembled to get people to go to the movie, but some of them were headline cameos. This movie could have been shortened, needed developed characters, and needed a plot. Don't rent it until it's really cheap.",5,2,5,6 April 1999
