The Avengers," Avengers marvelous assembled!
","If you are a big fan of superhero movies, this is the best choice for you. Plenty of supernatural power and high technology are served. Also a variety of characters too. This is the first time 6 legends of MCU met each other. Moreover, this is the debut of the villain that creates the most connection with audience. Absolutely, I can say this is a unforgettable movie.
The film started in S.H.I.E.L.D. There were a research about Tesseract, one of the most powerful weapons and energy sources that came from space. This ambition of humanity brought Loki to the world. He destroyed everything to get Tesseract and throne. Moreover, he use his wand to control Hawkeye. Therefore, S.H.I.E.L.D. had to have heroes to fight and that made 6 unique persons to be Avengers. Tony Stark, or Iron man, was the first one in Avengers. Then, Natasha, Hulk, Captain america, and Thor followed. Could they beat Loki and how? Or could they bring Hawkeye back?
I like all of the actors and actresses in this movie. They could present their characters and understand them deeply. Especially, the 6 Avengers. The first one, Robert Downey Jr. , as Iron man, he is a very high experience actor and his performance represent Tony Stark very good. His funny habit made us more enjoy in this movie. The second one, Scarlett Johansson, as Natasha, she is female delegate that as important and talent as male. Although she didn't have any supernatural power, her mind and her physical is very strong. And Johansson can do it so well. Next one, Mark Ruffalo, as Hulk, although he wasn't the first man who act as Hulk, he can handle it perfectly both human form and Hulk form. He made us believe it was a monster inside him. The fourth and also the first Avengers, Captain america, played by Chris Evan. He is the one who had highest leadership, suitable to captain's position. He could make people love Captain america even though he didn't have any supernatural power except a Vibranium shield and America flag colored suit. The last one, Hawkeye, presented by Jeremy Renner, I really like him in this movie. He did so nice in the scene he was controlled. It looked like he was really controlled.
In this film, I think it was a gorgeous to see all the Avengers met each other and fight together. The story was continuously and smoothly from the beginning to the end. On the other hand, maybe, the way to pull Hawkeye out of control had to be harder. Also the way to beat enemy. But totally, this movie was still great and worth watching.",9,0,0,22 December 2019
Frozen," Unforgettable Movie Ever Since
","This movie is one of my favorite Disney movies ever since which is Frozen. The story is mainly about a snow Queen who scares to be herself and scares to regulate her own power. Actually, she has one younger sister Anna. When Elsa was a kid, she used to play with Anna, but one day she played uncarelessly with her sister, then she unintentionally released her icy power to her sister's heart which was an eternal curse. After that, she was cured by a mystical troll and never had a chance to play with Elsa again.
One day, it's time for Elsa to take control the whole kingdom Arendelle. In other word, she is going to become a queen. As a result, Elsa and Anna had chance to meet each other again. After the royal coronation ceremony day passed, there's a big party fulled with crowded people coming from many different cities. Anna found Prince Hans, and she thought it's a true love. After telling Elsa about this, she uncontrollably released her icy power without knowing that her power made a neverending winter in the Arendelle, then she ran away to a far away land. Her younger sister, Anna, had to bring summer back to Arendelle. She started the journey by following her sister's footstep, and accidentally met Kristoff, who was a lumberjack. Kristoff decided to help Anna find Elsa for returning summer to the kingdom.
There're three main characters which are Elsa, Anna and Kristoff. They made the story much more impressive filled with joy and happiness, although there're some sad scenes a bit. It can make the story recalled by most spectators, even though they watched it for a long time.
This story is totally involved with love between family or even girl and boy. When I watch it, it make me feel like our world is much more beautiful filled with love. In my point of view, there're some scenes which are funny. For example, at the end of the story Olaf, who is a snowman with a big carrot for his nose, said that he would melt because of the hot weather, so Elsa use her power to create a cloud with a snow above Olaf's head, and then he felt excited and acted in a kind of weird, but funny. There's one scene that represents love in the family, and it remind me of how much my family love me.
Sometimes we don't have to try hard to find where true love is, but look back to our family who always stays by our side and always be there for you. No matter what happens, family is the only thing who always stays with you. In fact, you have to believe yourself that you can do it. Don't let your fear overcome you, but you have to overcome it. This movie taught me a lot. Just be proud of who you really are, and try to be the best version of you, so you won't regret at all. Frozen can inspire you quite a lot.
Frozen may appropriates to people of all ages. It's a comedy animation film, and it's a heartwarming either. Actually, it's not a serious movie at all. In my perspective, most kids must enjoy watching Frozen because it involves with magic and the song is so sweet too. I would give 9/10 for this movie",9,1,2,23 December 2019
