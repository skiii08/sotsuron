The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Rebel with a Cause - a very week social drama due to disregard of psychological science
","An author and a movie-maker are two totally different career personalities. It isn't always easy for an author to turn his own novel into a feature-length movie. Even though there are exceptions, in general the idea of writing a drama novel develops through emotions and thoughts, whereas writing a movie requires thinking in visuals and in character motives. As a novel 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' has published by MTV in the year 1999 for Young Adult audiences. Examining social psychology as a subject matter is the leading concentration herein. This novel has several references from English Literature works and Western Philosophy movements. Author Stephen Chbosky reflects his opinions on struggles of an adolescent growing up to adulthood in a western society where the adolescent has to face isolation and alienation while delving deeply into individual freedom as it is the case in Nihilism, Absurdism, and in Existentialism. The refusal of loneliness is the concealed and driven force of being a wallflower. Being a wallflower for an adolescent in this film stands for acting the cool guy, and acting the wanna-be-popular guy. According to Albert Camus, the French philosopher, this is the definition of being a 'rebel'. But the promised concealed and driven force of being a wallflower isn't displayed in the film, which is the initial problem of the chain of other continued failures. The reasoning with choosing to be a wallflower is explained through shyness. If the Charlie character is made shy, how can he easily strip down his clothes in front of a hundred people on the Rocky Horror Picture Show night? The psychological trauma awaiting after committing such a 'rebel' action for a shy person may be very severely grievous, or may be not. Let's hope it may not. The ease of dialogues and interactions between Emma Watson's character(Sam) and Charlie are also improper with the given character motives. She types 'write about us' to Charlie's typewriter. And what does Charlie do in return? He types 'I will'. This is just nonsense. Later on she goes to sit on her bed sort of inviting him to sex. The moment as a couple they were about to start making out, as Sam touches Charlie on his inner thighs, Charlie recalls his sister who is dead. How can you recall your late sister while your dream girlfriend makes love to you as she touches your thighs? Reality is that Charlie's character is not directed to be a shy character. He is just a cool but abnormally depressive character. And this has nothing to do with being a wallflower. Charlie is the next James Dean. Everything he did to lure girls, so did James Dean the same way. For over 65 years in Hollywood, being the cool and rebel guy always created more impression on girls rather than being a nice popular guy. This is a huge and inexcusable directing inferiority. Whoever loved this film, loved it because of the resolution at the end. Whereas also whoever hated this film, hated it because of the revelation at the end. The Perks of Being a Wallflower film has two main themes: 1/ Finding the love you deserve 2/ Finding the meaning of becoming an adult Each theme is in contradiction with each other. This film offers us the resolution that seeking the love you deserve keeps you away from becoming an adult. And it offers us the revelation of finding the meaning of becoming an adult in Nihilist freedom of an understanding that you cannot run after love, love will come to you.",4,7,14,2 November 2013
Ghost," When You're DEAD, It's ALL OVER; but When You're LOVED, It's FOREVER !
","The imaginative but well-conceived idea of dishing up a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually owing to one of them is dead, was first filmed by Steven Spielberg 8 months before the Ghost's silver screen release. Spielberg's movie Always(1989) had classy use of visuals fulfilling the needs of viewers with mystery-based expectations. Yet, Always lacked the sense of essential romance concept, despite having the same plot and even the same storyline in Ghost. Originally the idea has been created by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm.However, Ghost accomplished of what 'Always' tried and failed to accomplish. Thanks to the great acting trio of Patrick Swayze + Demi Moore + Whoopi Goldberg, for together they registered indelible moments into Ghost. It is scraped in our memory how in time Molly and Sam happen to keep their thoughts off each others' feelings, and that taught us: 'Love begins with emotions, ends with thoughts'. On this account they never called off their faith on believing that they will keep an enduring love affair. These indelible scenes in Ghost are conceptually cut where the editing was so impressive that instead of trying to make the story more plausible, it empowered the devotion of lovers onto their relation. The scene which Sam's ghost drew upon Oda Mae's body to break the longing with Molly by kissing her is an imperishable cinematic instant. I was in love with someone, and it was February,2005; we were both watching the Ghost on TV, both talking on the phone. Then that scene came upon(Sam's ghost kissing Molly in Oda Mae's body), I felt lost deep in my heart seeking the girl I'm talking on the phone. I heard she was crying and sobbing, and keep saying to me: 'I will never forget the first time you kissed me and I don't need to be alive to recall this' Ghost is one timeless romantic masterpiece that had its moments. For me the kissing scene was the best kiss in movies of all time. MTV had honoured this kiss as well, several years after the release of the movie, as the best kiss in '90s. Superimposing that, the scenes where Oda Mae Brown convinces Molly that Sam's ghost is around her and then Molly reasons with police that Oda Mae knows what nobody is able to know but Sam and herself only, are the scenes that deliver the magic beyond eyes and beyond ears.To watch Ghost is in the to do list of what to do when you're on a date.",8,77,91,25 September 2008
As Good as It Gets," Talking' about everything upon nothing. If this has been a Sit-com series, couldn't have seen the second season.
","A telly-familiar face from the production crew of the Simpsons series, James L. Brooks, directs a 5-year old screenplay and rakes up a pretentious cast of actors. The original script has been written by Mark Andrus in 1992, and has been developed differently from its origin in 5 years time by the director James L. Brooks. The length of the time passed in between this period has surely deprived the efficiency of its editing. Hence, we shouldn't have expected a good relation between the storyline and the plot. Thankfully, James L. Brooks hasn't even put a plot on view. So we get a simple sit-com entirely tied to the actors' contribution in this comedy/family movie. When a movie goes nowhere via its point, comedy is the easiest cure to make it find a way. Consider a horror movie, you watch it but you don't feel any fear; in order to be meant for something, a horror can be cured with some comedy, that way can it only become interesting. On the other hand, comedy is the hardest cure to make a point-lost movie find a way; 'cause you gotta have Oscar worthy performances at least to make it worth to watch. As Good As It Gets is the worst movie of 1997 with its technical features:Editing is the worst, screenplay is a mess, no camera aspects, no successful sound editing or mixing(no one has no idea how can a puppy murmur through a garbage chute and can be heard inside an apartment unit), art decoration has zero achievement(that's why it's a sit-com) ; at the same time As Good As It Gets is at its best for 4 great performances: Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson at the leading, Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr. at the supporting. If a Hollywood movie is just leaning upon its cast, why watching Hollywood then? As Good As It Gets absolutely deserved its 2 actor-based Oscars and in total 3 actor-based nominations. The other 4 nominations are a fine cods-wallop! Priggery and meticulousness are very well staged by Nicholson, playing a quirky character at the culminating point of capturing viewers' attention, reminding us of Bart Simpson at age 60; especially with his style of walking crab-wise on the street. Helen Hunt plays and heartens a mother of a sick child within bearing of her vicissitude of fortune at one side, bearing Jack Nicholson as the menace of her emotional argument at the opposite side. Cuba Gooding Jr. is a self-assertive individual and the only person in the movie who can deliver a replication to Nicholson. Additionally, Greg Kinnear is the gingerbread of the movie playing the beaten and robbed gay artist. Because each one of the actors has a complete different view of life, the non-plotted script magnetizes us growing our curiosity on if they ever roll up like a hedgehog together. As Good As It Gets made me want to watch Seinfeld. Based upon same idea, to play along with each other, Seinfeld is much much more better than this one of its analogous. There is absolutely no technical feature to make As Good As It Gets a worth-watching movie. It is likable only for its remarkable acting.",3,26,62,27 September 2008
The Other Boleyn Girl," Not a good historical film, but a considerable drama with indefensible historical laxity.
","Don't trust either good or bad critics upon 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. It's a serious thing to castigate such a bold work. First of all, this movie is a mediocre adaptation of a heart-breaking novel of late epochs of the English kingdom and the royal family. This work of art(both novel and the movie) has a courage to reveal the unknown reasons of English kingdom becoming less potent with the Renaissance revolution from Italy, and losing the support of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church, accordingly becoming adversaries with Italy.The Renaissance revolution is strongly flowing all over the movie just effectively with the Love. Yes, Renaissance invented the Love; but not lonely. There supposed to be growing artists, poets, sculptors, etc. Where are they? Even, we see the palace of the kingdom, the courtroom, the royal family's bedrooms all like a dungeon. Love wouldn't be existed, unless there is Art. Regrettably neither director nor the screenwriter is aware of the Renaissance flow of the actual novel. Hence the spirit of the movie is lost; and they still try to make us believe that the king of England is cruel and he has set apart the lovers. On the contrary, in fact English kingdom always had let literature, theater and love grow.Beside this failure, this fiasco of the plot; the cinematography and the costume design are stunning. The music score is outstanding, yet we feel that the whole movie is in a mournful silence.After all, we have a touching story with a great deal of melodrama in a sensational way. It seems like it took much effort to get together this powerful cast of actors and their cordial acting. Give it a try; at least it's worth seeing.",5,32,52,11 September 2008
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," When a very best combat/platform game turns age 21, now it became a Swashbuckler film
","Prince of Persia is the BEST PLATFORM GAME on computer I ever played as a child. It's not that industrial standard movies can create new ideas, they have to find a source to make an adaptation, but Sands of Time doesn't stand enough loyal to its title. What not staying loyal to Prince of Persia means, there is not any visually admirable combat with the film at all. When it's been first released, AUTUMN 1989, in Apple II; there were only a palace, a peasant child, a princess under the Caliph's servitude and hundreds of guardians defending the palace. Our peasant child as a spy was there to rescue the princess to bring her back to father the Persian Emperor. Looking at the continuation of the game series, the story is taken back in time about 15 centuries back to Persian realm before the birth of Christ. When I played the 2003 Sands of Time game on X-Box, the combat sense of the game had been gone. It was rather boring and bothersome since our peasant has become a prince, with not much to do other than jumping back and forth over the house roofs like Spider-Man.What's good with the movie better than its 2003 version of video game is we have more challenges than the game here. It's widely enriched with industrial standards. Classic cat and mouse type tags, rebel and noble girl falling in love with the boy, people from evil side turning to good side, suspicious characters seeking tricky and manipulative ways of possessing more power and authority, good side falls into an adventure/journey as a team, proves the importance of teamwork and beats the odds: The very-well known SWASHBUCKLER clichés since 1950s' Erol Flynn flicks, 1960s' Akira Kurosawa Seven Samurai, 1980s' Conan the Barbarian with Arnie, Indiana Jones with Harrie, 1990s' The Mummy, and from recent years the LOTR and the Pirates of the Caribbean. Prince of Persia has a lot to offer to the video game fans, but not much to offer for movie fans at all.With great aspects from locations and change on weather conditions especially on desert, this movie is considerably interesting, even though most of them are CGI; animals from desert, the OSTRICHS, the COBRA SNAKES and ARMORED HORSES even though it's not appropriate with its history.Sands of Time as a production had great potential of usage in props, but either the producers never made a deep research or may be they just couldn't provide them. In the computer game, the props were the heart of the franchise. FLYING CARPET, DOUBLE-SIDED ALTER-EGO CREATOR MIRROR, POTHOLE AMBUSHES, BARRED DOORS, ROTTEN PUNK FLOORS, ELIXIRS...(for the full list props from the game, please go to the Message Board to find my message, in the title page). Here in the film, a large barred door been used, but it was a pre-built one with very well-known studio usage from 1980s' RED SONJA especially. Other cons were the SACRED DAGGER which given its name to the title of the movie, the POISONED KING DALMATIC. Other than those the costumes of the actors were only average. But the Princess needed a better costume other than a gown.I found the editing job in the introduction scenes and the first half very pathetic. It became a matter of story design afterwards. There are bunches of continuation mistakes, costume changes without the location changes and errors in every other scene while telling the drama sequences. I'm crazy for sword combats in action movies, but Sands of Time displayed one of the worst sword combats I've ever seen, Jake needed to practise more on handling swords. In this case, even the Pirates of the Caribbean was so-so. If it's the matter the best sword combat was used in Star Wars 30 years ago. As a reminder, the first 3 games until 1999, Prince of Persia was full of excitement with its excellent sword combat simulations. Instead of sword combat, we witness the agility skills of our Prince, making the guardians run after him, jumping back and forth over the house roofs. If you're using agility skills to display in such a Swashbuckler; then what's Spider-Man, X-Men, BatMan for? For the cuts and takes from the action scenes, which is hard to say 'combat', director Mike Newell has preferred mostly C.U. shots, that's dated back to John Woo, which is underclass nowadays. So as an action genre, Sands of Time fails almost every aspect. But there is one thing, I most fond of is the Hassansin soldiers and their combat weapons, and the successful sound effects comes with them.The story design is pathetic, but we feel a nice development work on the story-telling. There is not many heritages from Persian Mythology, so it's fine and dandy to draw the long bow, but why is it always TIME-TRAVEL, isn't there anything else for the Mythological Gods to represent their power on Earth? After the first half, when the exact idea of who is on evil side, who is on good side is established, and when it's their time to challenge each other; it becomes breath-taking to watch and admire the Sands of Time.Story: 3/10 , Story Development: 9/10, Production Design: 2/10, Sounds: 7/10, Effects: 7/10, Acting: 5/10, Script: 3/10, Visuals: 7/10, Action: 5/10, Adventure: 7/10, Fantasy and Creativity: 4/10. Overall my mark is 6.5/10. Time is never wasted if it's for fun while watching Sands of Time",7,22,39,15 June 2010
Zodiac," A still Open Serial Killer Case at the end, a failure of Act of Justice
","It's a two and a half an hour long movie, but this is not the thing that makes the Zodiac boring; it's the non-stopping phone ring rings! We, the viewers, kept yelling 'Somebody please answer the phone!' all the time, since more than half of the movie took place at the newspaper agency. Instead of playing a cool mob music at the sound background, for some reason or other the sound crew keep ringing the office phones. Especially when you consider those phones are the 1960s' grandma phones with the most nerve-racking ringing melody.Collecting the whole factual news regarding the Zodiac killer, director Fincher serves us a still open serial killer case. Detectives and newspaper crew join hands together to solve the mystery which Zodiac left after. The detectives even caught the right killer once, though after his interrogation he was released for the deficiencies of evidence. Years passed by and only one detective remained involving with the case. Everyone else quit, everyone else gave in. He froze his research and let time go by. Then a cartoonist appears, who seemed like he was having fun from the game at the beginning. Yet the cartoonist took every detail seriously, collected and manipulated every useful information and combined each clue together. Finally, he resolved the Zodiac mystery; and found out the criminal. When he stated the name of whom he found, the detective begins helping him coming to the same culmination he came years ago: The criminal is distinct. He is known identically. However, there is still no sufficient evidence. At that point, act of justice fails.The ending connects with the reality: The Zodiac case is still open. The criminal is not yet caught because of the deficiencies of evidence. All we need to have is someone like Sherlock Holmes. This case needed Sherlock Holmes. Zodiac, the movie, needed a hero detective to detect the necessary evidence. Regrettably, Fincher didn't think the same way we thought. He took an empty pride in leaving a case open and a criminal uncaught, to show us a failure of Act of Justice.",7,24,45,22 September 2008
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," The premise is hard to fit into two hours and into this sort of plot-structure
","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, a movie adapted from one of the best Cold War era crime novels, with the same title with a slight difference: 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy'. When you put commas as they appear on the 1974 novel cover, you get to understand that a tinker is a spy, a tailor is a spy, and a soldier also is a spy. And when you think of it, you get to ask yourself this question: 'Why would a tinker turns a spy, and a tailor, and a soldier too?' Take a guess to answer the question above. 'Cause if you don't, the movie, which is terribly directed, won't tell you what the spies are trying to find out. Here is the truth after the unknown. The truth lies underneath a tongue twister game Children of the Cold War in Britain used to play. The tongue twister is this, as it appears on the prologue of John le Carré 's novel: 'Tinker... Tailor... Soldier... Sailor... Rich... Poor... Beggar... Robber, take the sea-shells and take the jacket buttons, trade in daisy leaves and trade in sunflower seeds, now you did, we are friends, we are friends, we are friends' While reading the novel, which is consisted of 42 episodes, 7 episodes for each occupation from the children's tongue twister and there are 6 pieces in the game of Chess. 7 times 6 equals to 42. When you pair them with each other, you get to solve the mystery: Chess pieces from highest rank to the lowest rank: 'King... Queen... Rook... Bishop... Knight... Pawn' Let's pair them: 'Tinker is King... Tailor is Queen... Soldier is Rook... Sailor is Bishop... Rich is Knight... Poor is Pawn' When Bishop(Gary Oldman as Smiley) explores the Rook(John Hurt as Control)'s chess board with the names and photos of his subordinates(Knight and Pawn), even Smiley didn't know that he was the Bishop. And when the Knight(Mark Strong as Prideaux) is assassinated, what should the Rook do next? That's what the movie is about. Since the promise is a heavy secret, which both the screenwriters and the director hides away from the audience, to fit the story into this sort of plot-structure ; then you don't have much to tell. John le Carré 's novel is one of the best boring novels I've ever read in my life, even though it has a unique mystery. Yes, it's a mystery, but in fact there is nothing happening at the present time. It's just all thoughts and ideas about the events in the past, in order to find the mole that destroys the organization's plans. Should every crime story necessarily be involved with a mole? So, don't expect nothing original to find, when you're watching Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, except some unique production aspects as follows: 1- Unpredictable hero 2- No bad guy to challenge against 3- An unrevealed secret turns good guys into bad guys 4- Suspicion, kills! 5- Spectacular views from some European cities, the shots from the city of Istanbul are the most accurate ones(except the Hotel shot) after other hit movies such as Eastern Promises, James Bond: From Russia With Love and a Jackie Chan comedy/crime flick If you really want a good crime/thriller/mystery watch Robert De Niro and Matt Damon 's The Good Shepherd(2006), since in this specific genre and sub-genre mix no better movies filmed yet.",5,25,41,16 December 2012
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Introducing the new generation Infant Homicides: 'Danielle Panabaker & Ed Sanders'
","2007 has passed with 2 tracer bullet psycho-crime movies; Mr.Brooks and Sweeney Todd, with similar endings: Miss Jane Brooks(Danielle Panabaker) hunted his father(Kevin Costner) and Little Toby(Ed Sanders) overcame his master(Johnny Depp). We'll look forward to see if producers and directors can make good use of these new generation infant homicides, in future. Tim Burton is having his leading actor killed for the first time, if we consider Beetle Juice as an immortal superhero. Responsibly, Sweeney Todd dies just after he accidentally killed his beloved wife. I don't know why, but lately in all psycho movies, all the bloody grim killers turn into mother's pet at the end. Since when? Since Mary Harron's 'American Psycho'(which had Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, the man of the dark nights, had become Christopher Nolan's Batman afterward). This way or another, every psychopathic killer is completely bewildered and is repented at the end. Yet before, there was no repentance. For instance, Beetle Juice was never repented, Addams Family were never repented, Reservoir Dogs were never either. Somebody please tell me: Who put this repentance law to psycho movies? Anyway, Sweeney Todd:The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a musical film-noir from Tim Burton with his original style of bearish and abominable bugs'n beetles movie.",7,15,22,15 September 2008
21," Nothing funny, nothing sensational, nothing joyful; perhaps a little interesting
","Worth to watch for spectacular views from Las Vegas, the movie 21 starts with a 'Maverick'ish gambler movie opening. Though, this movie is not even half good as Maverick. We initially see how Jack and Ace forms a lovely couple. Then we meet our leading actor Ben something, the singing frog of the movie 'Across the Universe', as a very sharp-witted campus kid trying to persuade the dean of the Harvard Medical School to access student scholarships.A gambler gang of campus kids leading by Kevin Spacey drives Ben and the others' -including Kate Bosworth as another campus kid- minds over gambling in Las Vegas by means of proved mathematical methods of counting cards. Ben, who must have swallowed a calculator, becomes the smartest one of all. We are witnessing our campus kids how actually they gamble with cheating over cards at a casino. Best thing of the casino scenes are the chance of getting know how the backstage of security cams goes. There are a bunch of technicians trying to catch whoever does cheating on the games.The actual happenings of the story is hidden behind the script. Accordingly, it forces us to undone the knots. Yet regrettably, the search for straightening the story is just getting boring and boring until the end starts to occur, while leaving mentioned questions unanswered.Thankfully at the final, knots are getting undone. For five minutes long, while Rolling Stones-You Can't Always Get What You Want is playing, we see how the life takes on shape for each character. Then we end up at where we started; back on the faculty dean's room, Ben is still talking to the dean. Whole movie has passed in this room, we realize. The dean looks persuaded by Ben for his scholarship.",5,23,41,30 August 2008
Salt," Jolie's betrayals
","By its courage on enlightening KGB's anti-globalist vista, I first thought Salt is an adaptation, till I find out the fact that it's written for the screen by Kurt Wimmer, the genius writer of Equilibrium(2002)-which is the best contemporary sci-fi screenplay I've ever heard of-. As a matter of production, if Salt is especially written for Angelina Jolie to play the lead, Phillip Noyce isn't a bad choice at all to direct the movie; but I could still have preferred Kurt Wimmer to direct it, as he did the Equilibrium. Angelina Jolie's first action was Cyborg-2(1993), in which she showed the white feather for a thrill to be created out of a bad Jean-Claude Van Damme sequel; and she was pretty good at that. Consider that I compare her acting from the age of 18 with her capacity in Salt, herein she doesn't act nothing. It is either the director or herself that makes the movie seems like it's been done before with same look of scenes from Tomb Raider or Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible and the likes of them.As a whole, Salt is well worth to see and enjoy with suspense-action-thriller type of storyline. But as the one thing in common with all the suspense stories, there is a breach in the story development. It gets complicated and confusing at times forcing us to figure out if Jolie is working for CIA or KGB. The fact is that Jolie betrays every person she meets. She betrays CIA first, then when we start guessing she's a Russian militant but then she assassinated the Russian president. The problem is that what everyone calls them plot holes, there are no plausible reasons for why Jolie betrays everybody. Maybe in real life Brad Pitt asked this question to himself too.",7,22,38,19 August 2010
The Exorcist," One Genre Renewal movie: The Exorcist - Horror with no Crime, instead Horror with Spirits
","Two terrible sequels and one irrelevant remake were never replaced with the original, the 1973 version of The Exorcist; and no other version will never be any more. Written for the screen and produced by William Peter Blatty, both The Exorcist movie and the novel are incident driven basis of the actual happenings from 1949.Looking at the most remarkable movies of 1973, there are 3 other important ones that the history of cinema will remember: -- A slow and touching movie from Ingmar Bergman 'Cries and Whispers' -- Bernardo Bertolucci's depressive movie, a study of love 'Last Tango in Paris' -- A crime story with Redford and Newman 'The Sting'. Among all and all the other movies that are produced in this year, The Exorcist stands one step further than the rest for its uniqueness on genre renewal. It's not the first movie that features the Demon in its content, yet in the Exorcist the Demon is introduced in the human level. The idea of being possessed by a spirit is used for the first time ever on the silver-screen. Horror genre featuring spirits didn't need to refer to Crime any more like it used to be in Hitchcock ages. Thus crime became a separate genre, and mostly acted conjointly with thrillers from now on.This uniqueness profits from its sound mixing, great lighting techniques and of course a perfect screenplay. Director William Friedkin was lucky to find his producer Blatty, being also the novel-writer and the idea creator. The plot and the story development goes very smoothly: From Father Merrin's encountering with the Demon Pazuzu in Iraq; to Ellen Burstyn looking for the cure for her daughter's disease, going for visits to every type of doctor... From the noises in the attic, to Regan's peeing on the rug... From decoding the Demon's speech of speaking English in reverse, to the arriving of Merrin... Both the editing and directing gave high qualities to this film.The 25th Anniversary edition DVD is in my movie collections. It's a must to have for horror fans. Either you have this version of DVD or the year 2000 version; you should check out the special features that reveals the real-life 1949 incident, the missing and the deleted scenes including the Spider-walk scene, sound mixing and sound effects tests show how they created the demon's voice and the BBC documentary: The Fear of God, all in the special features.",9,52,72,25 December 2009
P.S. I Love You," Helping Lost People Finding Where Their Hearts Are
","People change in time, relationships change in time; Love doesn't. A man expresses his feelings of his love to his wife, through several shocking surprises after his death. This movie would tell why love is the only power that connects people, if no one could tell anymore what it really means. Gerry and Holly's relationship is a good example of how couples bring their love to the end quickly. Leading actors Swank and Butler accomplished wholeheartedly acting jobs. A true success with Harry Connick Jr.'s role playing Holly's first flirt, but poor acting from Jeffrey Dean Morgan(whom we'll see him in 'Watchmen' next year) playing as her second. As a novel adaptation, the screenplay is effectual. Some parts of the script is totally noticeable that hold our attention continuously. I liked the editing job very well after I've seen the deleted scenes from the special features of the DVD. The music score is so relaxing and emotional. Everybody keeps telling this film is a tearjerker, which I disagree; it's only because of the sensational existence of Hilary Swank. Her talented way of expressing psychological trauma just catches eyes, that's all. There are 5 of my favorite scenes which I rewind each time I watch: 1*One of the greatest opening scenes for a romance of all time. In that scene just in 2 minutes, we get what type of personalities each character has. Lovers find a quarrel over a straw. They yell at each other, and Gerry leaves Holly getting out of the door. A minute passes or not, Holly comes back from bathroom and Gerry back from the door. Then they wildly lock in a close embrace after running towards to each other into the middle of the living room... 2*After the funeral of Gerry, at a time when Holly's longing of him hits the top, she can't help herself calling the home-phone from her cellphone just to listen to Gerry's voice from his answering machine record; while trying to sleep... 3*Holly's receiving of Gerry's first P.S.I Love You letter and his true guesses of what Holly is going to say in respond after his each time of gaffes... 4*Gerry's calling to memory of their first meeting in Ireland, from his words... 5*And best of all, my best favorite scene: Holly's return to karaoke stage singing 'Love You Till The End' and imagining as if he is there forming a lonesome audience. This scene is the one I burst into tears. I don't remember myself crying because of a movie, or because of someone else's sadness ever; including the end of Dr.Zhivago or Love Story or The English Patient. Yet it just reminded me of a photo of my fiancée with whom we were parted away. In that photo she was standing on a step of an amphitheater watching my mockery of a stand-up show at the stage, forming the whole audience herself. This is a therapeutic relationship movie. Watch it with your partner and you'll be able to see the missing, lacking or the incomplete part of your unity. Strongly recommended for couples who used to be in love before. Find out why love is eternal.",9,63,72,27 December 2008
Across the Universe," This is abuse of music. If you want to see a socio-political musical watch 'WestSide Story-1961' .
","The first time I watched Across The Universe, was in Toronto International Film Festival. It had emphasized the effectiveness of music at the times of political wilderness and hotchpotch of ideologies through a teenage view. Yes, the use of music was mind-blowing; though in a radical -and so wrong- way.It is the same idea of a serial killer killing his victims by playing classical music, that a teenager group rises in rebellion against government by singing. And I just can't believe how people abuse the meaning of music. I mean neither Tchaikovsky composed his opera suites to turn someone into a serial killer, nor Paul McCartney wrote his lyrics to make adolescents rebels. Being radical-minded never corrects a mistake, nor arranges disorder. The story is based on a love story got through a strawberry crucified on an artist's drafting board. Yet, we only get melodrama when we're looking to find a story of love. Actors are somewhat harmonic among each other and are related within the screenplay, though sadly none really can portray a character at all. Moreover, there is not an adequate bearing between the screenplay and the story line, which is a true matter of directing. No bearings between the subject(happenings) and the object(consigning messages), either. Optimistically, it's a pretty good movie for relaxing and forgetting about the issues of life, as long as you don't focus into it. >:-(( 4/10.",4,31,55,9 September 2008
Avatar," Putting perfect Visuals and Virtualities aside, going deep into the Avatar's concept
","Looking into Hindu mythology, when Gods descend to Earth they acquire avatars to make themselves known by human beings. Of the recent years' TV animation series let's look over 'Ōban Star-Racers' from Jetix and 'The Last Airbender' from Nickelodeon for avatar concept. In Ōban Star-Racers, the Earth had been threatening by antagonist galactic races and human beings were expecting a savior from space who is called the Avatar. On the other hand in the Last Airbender, avatar concept was completely confused with Prophecy. Aang the Avatar was born in the form of human being, which is wrong; because Avatar is a form of a God which has no destiny, no life, no death. Herein James Cameron's Avatar, the concept is truly appropriate to the origins of Hindu mythology: When humankind explores the planet Pandora, they aimed to search for underground resources; so they send an ex-serviceman to the natives in a DNA mapped hybrid body(which seems like one of them) to capture their secrets. Becoming the Avatar of natives by time, the ex-serviceman saves the planet from humankind, turning against his origin. Exploring a new planet, descending on the ground, trying to capture it by blending within natives, but failing to do so... This actually is the same storyline with a Sci-Fi legend: Franklin Schaffner's 'Planet of The Apes(1968)'. Still keeping its sense with having the most terrifying ending of all science fiction works ever created, Planet of The Apes has so many things in common with Avatar. The Apes and the Na'vis both seemed atrocious and uncivilized at first. Then we realized that they're in fact very cuddly creatures. Both Charlton Heston and Sam Worthington became beloved with a female native, and we're introduced to their untouched and God's gift virgin nature. Then as in Star Wars and Abyss, humankind declares war against the natives to capture their lands and resources. Another unique similarity between Planet of the Apes is that humankind is the evil-side again. So the same message we get with a deeper self-criticism is that humankind is the one who destroys the nature and is responsible of all wars. Wasn't this the Terminator's message as well, spoken out by Sarah Connor? 'It's in our nature to destroy ourselves'. All to the good, we didn't lose our World to apes or cyborgs this time.",7,32,52,19 December 2009
Inception," Dreams are not even %50 human mind control... Seeing the Inception from a more realistic, Tarkovsky perspective
","~MY REVIEW CONTAINS SEVERAL REFERENCES TO TARKOVSKY, A QUOTATION FROM ROGER EBERT AND ANOTHER FROM CHRISTOPHER NOLAN'S INCEPTION SCRIPT (for detailed info check below the end of this article)~ Ideas need to be enriched while the roots are kept loyal, especially in Sci-Fi. Above everything else, aware of the fact that while the story is taking place in several dimensions of dreams, there is no link to the real-life. My first point is about this huge story development deficiency. The only link to our universal earth dimension is Michael Caine character and the children, and they're frozen, they're playing out there in the garden, we see from behind. This is the first thing why the whole movie is para-psychologically inappropriate. I said para-psychologically inappropriate, 'cos today psychology is in the point that dreams expose supernatural(or meta-physical) skills of human mind. If you are implanting an idea through a dream into someone's mind, it's not that easy, THE BALANCE OF NATURE WOULDN'T EASILY LET YOU DO THAT. As an example I want to compare the Inception with 'The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind'. There, Jim Carrey was going back time in his dream trying to identify the person who is dating with his fiancée; but he ends up with facing a supernatural vitality covering the person's face. The way Nolan explains is this: *(1)* 'Never recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places.' When the time comes where Saito explains why he hired Cobb for the implantation, this is all we get: *(2)* 'You remind me of someone... a man I met in a half-remembered dream. He was possessed of some radical notions' So the most important question one ever needs to ask 'How did they all start to dream implantation?'. There is no answer nor explanation to it. Whereas in its ancestor, 'The Minority Report' was quite brilliant at explaining the technological advance. Compare with Matrix, the dreams are your guides to the reality, you're not a guide to someone's dream. Matrix gives you a clue of understanding how some people's lives may change with their dreams and visions. It had this inspiration that Neo became a hero out of a loser. Dreams are able to do that, as Wachowski Brothers taught us. Another comparison can be done with the good and evil side. Nolan never divides people into good vs. evil as Batman or as Memento or any films he's done. But for someone's favor, Cobb is hired by business man to implant an idea into another business man, which doesn't do any thing with the good. *(3)* 'The only condition of fighting for the right to create is faith in your own vocation, readiness to serve, and refusal to compromise' Sci-Fi loves impossible, but it also denies the practical errors. Inception's plot is theoretically fine but practically slow off the mark. Just like Roger Ebert said at Chicago Sun, Inception's story can either be told in a few sentences or not told at all. Ebert's approach to criticize Nolan's earlier work was even more harsh. *(4)* 'How does a man with short-term memory loss, remember he has short-term memory loss?' (for Memento). Some injuries can go engraved someone's sub-conscious, so he didn't even need to remember it, he was just living it. Though Ebert was right on one thing, that if Ellen Page hasn't been enrolled in the movie as a new chosen one to this confidential job, the whole movie was almost meaning nonsense. The things that are likable is Marion Cotillard participating as a independent virus in dreams, going in and killing whoever and whenever she likes. Ellen Page is being used to create spaces in dreams, so that the missionaries will be able to create totems that tell a person whether they're dreaming or living the reality. The only totem without Ellen Page was the spinning of the whipping top in the sleep house. Also the last dream which Di Caprio is having on the airplane was cut in the half as if it was meant for to be continued. It was the only dream that made me believe that someone is dreaming, whether it's Cobb or Arthur or any of the missionaries. 'CAUSE DREAMS NEVER LAST. *(1)*(2)*: from Quotes for Inception at IMDb / *(3)* : from Andrei Tarkovsky quotes at thinkexist.com / *(4)* : from Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times, July.14.2010",6,19,35,9 August 2010
Raging Bull," It really is harder to Stay At the Top than to Reach the Top; just because Life has No Justice.
","Whoever is dissatisfied by Raging Bull, I'm sure they watched it with expectations of watching a sports movie, like Rocky. Despite the AFI chose Raging Bull as the #1 sports movie of all time, you can't expect to see the most breathtaking boxing match nor to witness the best crochet of boxing history. Raging Bull can only be classified as a drama/biography. Director Scorsese chose to go with black&white cinematography only to keep the young viewers away from this masterpiece of art. It's not fair to compare Rocky with Raging Bull. Rocky was a populist movie mostly for young viewers, and Raging Bull is a cinematic masterpiece. From a wide point of view, for instance, if you look at one of the Michelangelo's paintings; at first you see a nude woman, if you look longer and deeper you realize that her nudity expresses some thought, if you look continuously and give a life to it in your imagination you discover that the women are not just their bodies. Accordingly, like it is not enough looking once to a painting to understand what opinion does it defend; it is not reasonable and not fair to watch Raging Bull so as to see a sports movie. Also it is not reasonable to see Raging Bull only once. Raging Bull is one movie that, every time you watch it you get a better taste, every time you watch it you discover something new. Raging Bull taught us that even if you are the best at some skill, even if you are the best of all; you need to create witnesses, admirers and supporters of your skill. It's the only way to reach the top. Moreover, it is harder to stay at the top than to reach the top. Not because someone better than you can defeat you, it's just because of the need to be accepted on every authority; like the Council of Judges, the Media and the Admiration of People. Director Scorsese draws benefit from the hypocrisy of fame. He empowers Raging Bull to make people ask to their conscience if the popular values that people choose can really cherish their values. In Raging Bull, Jake La Motta was the best boxer of all, but people didn't like him. He was disrespectful, he was uncivilized, he was very ugly, he was arrogant, he was irritable and he didn't care; 'cause he believed himself. Despite the fact that he is the best, everybody disliked him. Soon, he was left alone; and in a very short time he lost everything he possessed. When he opened his eyes back to life, he found himself in prison. The scene that he is punching and butting the wall facing him is one of the most heart rending memorable scenes of the whole cinema history. At the end, he finally throws in the towel of believing himself, he loses his faith and becomes to learn what he never wanted to learn: The Fame. He starts running his own business at a night club under his name, working as a stand-up comedian at the stage. People laugh at him for the jokes he made out of his memories, the jokes paraphrasing the bitter facts of life; including the very famous joke of the British King Richard-III which he said in the year 1485 just before dying: 'A horse, a horse... My kingdom for a horse!'. There we understand truly: For every joke there lies a share of a fact underneath.",9,55,82,24 September 2008
Identity," Another journey to a serial killer's mind... A mindless popcorn flick
","Each Friday night of my teenagehood years passed with watching Horror classics. When the mysterious killer reveals out to be a child of my age or even younger, that had always gotten me into an excitement. Watching 'Nightmare on Elm Street' was a proof of mine, saying '-Look, I'm totally grown up, now. I don't afraid of Freddy any more. Huh huh!' , to mum.Time's changed. Horror genre is strengthened by mindless mysteries and sentimentalism. This new type of horror can't make viewers laugh or have fun any more. If not getting any fun from a horror, why watching it? The plot is solely good for mystery; yet the director chose to make a horror/teen slasher, which happened to be a fallacious deduction. Directing and editing is totally awful. 'Identity' is talented director James Mangold's worst movie. From 1995 to 2005, his first decade of industrial movie making experience had caught everybody's attention. The present time is 2009. His latest works 'Walk The Line' and '3:10 to Yuma' scored success both on box-office and on film critics. I wish we won't see any disappointment from him any more.Reminiscent of Agatha Christie's 'And There Were None'(1945), Hitchcock's Psycho and Kubrick's idea of mystery at Indian cemetery; there is no such thing as an original idea. The opening scene sparks off a traffic accident profits from each character's view of the accident. No one was guilty. Followed by coincidences 8 adult, 1 child and the runner of the motel got stuck in a deluge. The story telling was as good as 2004's best motion picture winner 'Crash'. Differently, they never tried to break free from their situation. Instead, they make each other fall into a calamity. After two more coincidences, we learned as a third coincidence that everyone shares the same birthday. 10 people, all of them, have born on the 10th of May. Then Amanda Peet tried to save the situation: 'This place used to be an Indian cemetery'.Even before the first half of the movie, it happened to become a comedy by a chain of disasters and coincidences. Thanks to Alan Silvestri, who has composed a good music score. Watching for the reason to learn what's going to happen at the end, has been the key factor that made viewers think this is better than an average movie. Quite frankly, it is not. Film editing is dreadful.1 out of 10 for editing. 8 out of 10 for acting. When you come to the end, you'll realize that it's not the movie you're watching any more. It's so easy that when a director puts all the different puzzles and mysteries altogether mixing them with some sentimentalism, and when at the end his leading actor says: 'Sorry, I am a paranoiac. I was only dreaming. Nothing really happened. Everything was just a dream.'",5,32,61,24 January 2009
Donnie Darko," I'm writing the 1889th comment on Donnie Darko here. When it hits 1988th comment, the world will come to an end; as Frank told me.
","'The dreams which I'm dying are the best I've ever had...' Most of the authorities reviewed Donnie Darko as a psychological thriller. Though, the look of this angle straitens the true understanding of this epic movie. Donnie Darko is a sci-fi classic and is mainly a superhero movie. 'If only I could go back in time and take all those hours of pain and darkness; and replace them with something better...' was Gretchen's wish. Donald died in his dream to prevent Gretchen getting killed in the real life. Although he believes that the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind is antiseptics(!), Donald had a vision. He gave whatever Gretchen wanted from life; and when she got all of her desired, the destiny was rewritten putting effect the fact that she has actually never met with Donald. Gretchen had been killed accidentally by Frank. In order to make Donald save Gretchen's life; a restless supernatural spirit,that wore Frank's Halloween night dress, sacrificed Donald and saved Frank's life.Donnie Darko brought out who rule the destiny of the world. The answer is neither God or humankind. It is angels(and/or daemons) that forms the fate and represents the balance of the nature. It is also clarified that only angels(and/or daemons) can travel in time.Jake Gyllenhaal performed Donald(Donnie Darko) and totally took on the tough responsibility of playing a schizophrenic superhero. Maggie Gyllenhaal, his sister both in the movie and in the real life, looked as the cutest of all her performances ever. Jena Malone was surely the right choice to perform as Gretchen, although she didn't give any extra effort to catch viewers' attention. Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze couldn't hold onto the blood-freezing atmosphere of the film. Best of all, Richard Kelly has done a great work of cinema. His style of holding the tension at the highest, and hiding clues of the storyboard all over the script were extra-ordinary. Cinematography was so brilliant and unique. Donnie Darko totally deserves to be one of the best sci-fi movies of all time for every aspect.Editing and theatrical cut was also a good job. There were deleted scenes that I got the chance to view from the DVD, just good to know. The film has been edited in a smooth and clever style. I got people all the time telling that Donnie Darko is a schizophrenic film, which is not fair. That would straiten the wide implications we can get. Those implications may include not just scientific thesis of quantum mechanics but also very important social criticisms. It is a mad world.",10,32,59,9 December 2008
Up in the Air," Average story development on an Interesting Plot, processed with Rich Screenplay Components
","Every year there are new film productions copying either independent, low-budget films or foreign language films. It's not always making copycats, but sometimes reflecting the same concept twice, as well. As the first thing to say, Up in the Air, doesn't reflect at all what the novel writer Walter Kirn tries to tell inside his story scoop. Besides, looking at this year's another production 'The Messenger' , we see the same character models and same story development tools, there. Is it also a coincidence that both Ben Foster and Anna Kendrick are being hired for the same type of work only within a different industry? If it is, the coincidences will continue by having Woody Harrelson and George Clooney as the trainers of our young fellas, and still continue with both Ben Foster and Anna Kendrick throwing in the towel before working their way up in the job. I find it necessary to look for external resources before evaluating a film after my first view. Up in the Air is a bad adaptation, totally messing up with its story; making it look cheerful and smart to the viewer. What's cheerful is making the audience feel sad and curious about the actors, and what's smart is the screenplay just offering a wise motto of life. The whole movie is actually the answer of one single question: 'What's Randy Bingman's motto in life?' George Clooney plays Randy the Mr.Backpack, who lives by means of his mouth. He makes a living with his mouth. From start to end, Randy just does 2 things: He talks and he travels. Randy's words are like passengers of a plane. When they are unspoken, they are at the gates waiting for their flight arrival. While they are being spoken, they may turn to have multiple meanings. But after they were spoken his words are in our memory: 'I want you to pack your backpack with little stuff you own. Your laptop, your desk, your chair, and your bed, and your room, and your house. Now, I want you to leave everything behind of you. Now, do you feel a bit light?''Your relationships are the heaviest components of your life. It's hard to get rid of them' Opening with a mocumentary style, George Clooney's confused character Randy introduces himself to us from the p.o.v of the people he sees and talks everyday. His job is his life and his personality. He is hired out to national companies of which managers prefer not to fire their own employees; instead Randy does this though job. He is a Human Resources professional. Awaring of his success, Randy's boss gives a trainee beside him. Thus Anna Kendrick's character -one of the best supporting actress nominees of the year in Academy- teams up with Randy. Clooney and Kendrick are coherent together, this gives us a chance to put ourselves in their shoes; even though their lives are boring and pockets are making huge amounts of paychecks with just talking and travelling. As the story goes it mostly becomes more boring, longer dialogues, longer scenes, terribly bad editing; very rarely there are important thematic values that offers us lifelong wise advices. On the other hand, the ideological concept is so feminist. Vera Farmiga's character, Alex always finds the right way to do and her acts are always right and she never makes mistakes; just like a super-heroine. Randy falls in love with her, and from her p.o.v it's Randy's mistake to come to her house to explore that she's married. 'Cause being open-hearted is not a proper code of conduct. This concept rules that women have rights to betray their husbands with making cool guys fall in love with them, while men are faulty when they think that marriage is an important decision and it must not be given very quick.Looking at the filming aspects, the first thing that comes to mind is there are so many directing and editing mistakes, mostly mistakes on the ongoing production phase: Deliberate errors by filmmakers... Crew and equipment visible when Natalie's being introduced due to the reflection in the glass window... Continuity mistakes expose that most of the scenes are reshot over and over again; and when the exterior scene backgrounds change, Jason Reitman's editors doesn't find it necessary to cut those scenes properly. When Ryan gets dropped off after leaving the school, you see him walking inside with the same car still in place, but in the next shot he's two steps behind of himself and the car is gone. During that party at Alex's place, she changes her sweater from satin blouse to black v-neck sweater and back again to her satin blouse in a very short period of time(less than a minute or two). Looking at all the picture compositions, all the qualities are just average; nothing more than that. Consider the Academy nominations, of all the 6 major award nominations Up in the Air got, it only deserves to win the Best Screenplay award. Myself as an amateur screenplay writer, even though I don't generally like adaptation scripts, Up in the Air is my favourite screenplay of this year. Sadly, the film altogether was nothing more than average. It should have nominated for Best Original Song as well for the song Up in the Air by Rolfe Kent.",7,20,39,26 February 2010
