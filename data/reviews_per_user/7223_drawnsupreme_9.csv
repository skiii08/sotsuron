Blade Runner 2049," Somewhat of a snooze fest.
","I'll start off with the bad stuff. Ryan Gosling's character felt like a very boring, hollow, one dimensional character. It seemed as if there was no depth to his acting because he has the same goofy face throughout the whole movie. I understand that he's a replicant in the film and is suppose to be emotionless, but throughout the film, as he is suppose to build up a bit more emotion, his acting still remains mundane.This is also an extremely slow-paced movie, making it feel boring and drawn out. The director could have cut, shorten and removed so many unnecessary and pointless scenes to where we could have had the film be 2 hours or less in length.In addition, the editing is very sloppy towards the ending of the film throughout the timid action sequences. It felt as if those scenes were just copy and pasted together at the last minute. How could you have Harrison Ford's scenes be so sloppy? There was so much potential to make this a thrilling part of the movie but it ends up falling flat.Now for the good stuff. The visuals are very nice. The settings feel futuristic and I think it really captures the vibe of the original film, which is really important for a sequel to do after all these years. The story is also good enough to keep you watching and the themes are interesting if you're a fan of the sci-fi genre.Over all, I feel that the execution of the movie is what needed work.",4,2,3,25 January 2018
It," It caught me by surprise.
","This was a great film. The performances were very good by each and every single cast member and the story felt new and refreshing.Some parts of the movie were highly suspenseful, making me very curious to see what would happen next. The director (and crew) did a great job building suspense and making the audience feel curious, keeping us glued to our seats as we watch in anticipation.My only gripe was that the 'jump scares' were a little overdone (which is so common with horror movies nowadays; these never scare me and I find these types of scenes annoying, especially when it's overused). In addition, some of the CGI effects didn't look believable or well-polished. They could have definitely improved on this.Over all, I highly enjoyed the film and I look forward to the sequel.",8,0,0,23 January 2018
Hereditary," Get this garbage outta' here!
","Hereditary is your typical distraught family, with the typical distraught kids, tied with the typical ghost possession story, sprinkled with a few special effects that try to make you gasp. I've seen it all. Seems like every 'horror' movie nowadays copies this same exact formula. One of these characters is probably possessed. Woopty-doo!Hereditary brings NOTHING new to the table. If you've watched films like The Exorcist, The Omen, or The Conjuring, for example, you'll notice how Hereditary tries to copy elements of those films, and many others.The best way to describe the tone of the movie would be monotonous, which also makes the pacing of the movie feel very slow.The movie attempts to build up, with random little events happening throughout, some actually LAUGHABLE - and actually finishes up with one of the DUMBEST and UNDERWHELMING endings to a movie that I have ever seen in my life.Everyone was hyping Hereditary up, claiming it was one of the scariest movies as of late - but this is pure nonsense. With an open mind, I sat through the movie but I just did not find it disturbing nor frightening in any way. Instead, I found it unoriginal, boring, and over-hyped by 'casual' horror fans. Maybe I've watched way too many horror movies in my life and am now 'numb' to this.",1,10,21,31 December 2018
Captain Marvel," One of the Worst Movies Ever Made
","From Brie Larson's cringe-worthy performance, to a weak and predictable story, this movie was COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY. It doesn't add anything to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You could easily skip Captain Marvel, head straight into Avengers: Endgame, and you wouldn't miss a beat. That's how pointless this movie feels.Brie's acting was atrocious. The way she walks as a superhero made me bust out laughing. The majority of the movie, she simply stands there, stares and smirks, maybe followed by a few witty lines - over and over again. Are you kidding me? Is Disney and Marvel kidding with this nonsense?The story is a predictable snooze-fest. Typical average person, becomes a superhero, fights off evil and saves the day with the help of a friend or two, blah blah blah. Lazy writing. Cliche. Predictable. Boring... and every joke fell flat. It's like they made this movie as uninteresting as possible on purpose.The only positive I found to be was Nick Fury (played by Samuel J. Jackson), who was very entertaining to watch since he plays the character perfectly, and his story arc develops a lot better throughout the movie. Compared to Brie Larson's wooden Captain Marvel portrayal, Sam's Nick Fury steals this one.I'm not sure what Disney and Marvel were thinking, but this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Whether this was just a filler between Infinity War and Endgame, or Disney/Marvel's response to Wonder Woman from Warner Bros/DC Comics, Captain Marvel just falls FLAT in ALL aspects.This movie should have never been made if you ask me.",2,12,17,11 June 2019
Aquaman," Feels Like a TV Show - Don't Waste Your Time
","This Aquaman movie has to be one of the most overly cheesy and boring movies I've ever seen.There are EXCESSIVE jokes and one-liners sprinkled ALL OVER this movie. Some of the scenes look like they were filmed on the set of a Power Rangers TV show, especially the Black Manta scenes. Just awful and uninspiring.Jason Momoa is a terrible actor who comes off as a surfer dudebro joker in just about every single scene - when we all know the Aquaman from the comics, TV shows, and video games - is portrayed to be more of a serious, charismatic person with leadership qualities - all of which Jason Momoa fails to bring to the table. In addition, if you're a REAL fan of the Aquaman character and have seen the DC animated film 'Justice League: Throne of Atlantis', then you may have noticed how significantly different the story is.Not sure what the writers, producers, and director were thinking, but this is an epic fail in the story-line department because they decided to basically make Aquaman a comedian and change major plot points from other reiterations of Aquaman's backstory.The only good thing about this movie was simply just some of the CGI action sequences (when Aquaman fights the trench monsters, for example).The villains (Orm and Black Manta) are extremely weak. Orm spends most of the movie talking smack but when it comes down to the epic final showdown, he doesn't put up much of a fight.Black Manta is another major disappointment. Again, if you've read the comics or even played the 'Injustice' video games, you know Black Manta is a warrior with some DAMAGING fighting skills and abilities - but again, is under-utilized and comes off as a weak side villain.These villains should have been much more BRUTAL, but unfortunately, they were weak.Skip this movie, especially if you're a fan of Aquaman from the comics, video games, or animated content. You'll be disappointed.",2,0,0,24 March 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Maybe Straight to Cable TV
","This is, by far, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Forget everything you know about Spider-Man because Marvel and Sony basically destroy the origins of the character and his story in general.In this movie, Peter Parker is basically a (get this) dumb teenager who doesn't know what he's doing for the majority of the film. He's also extremely weak - he cannot stop a bank robbery, he gives himself a concussion (WTF), he cannot handle a guy with a shock glove without help, etc.This Spider-Man is a giant wimp and comes off as as an annoying little kid who is always whining or has something silly to say for two hours straight. Way too childish.The movie is also pretty liberal, pushing a variety of different races down your throat the entire time. There are so many mis-casted characters, that it makes the movie feel weird and awkward.The action sequences are boring and forgettable. I was somewhat happy to hear that Marvel and Sony had come to an agreement for a Spider-Man movie but after watching Homecoming, I don't know why I waited around for something so disappointing.Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2' is still THE BEST Spider-Man movie, hands down.",1,14,27,31 October 2017
Doctor Strange," Pure sci-fi fun
","Doctor Strange is an excellent film with an interesting script and very good performances.Benedict Cumberbatch did an excellent job playing Dr. Stephen Strange and I could not imagine anyone else being able to play the role to the level that he did. His personality, wit, stubbornness and ambition were portrayed very well on screen. Rachel McAdams also played her role perfectly and I really hope she gets more screen-time in future movies.The story is also a little different from what we've seen in previous Marvel movies and some of the visuals reminded of other great sci-fi films, such as Inception and The Matrix, but Doctor Strange sets itself apart with a wonderful introductory story to the character within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The action sequences were pretty cool but I feel they could have been a lot more intense and breathtaking in a world where the perception of reality are limitless. Visually, it was still nice to look at but the potential to be much more thrilling was definitely there after watching the movie.Overall, this was a fun film to see and I highly recommend it if you've enjoyed Marvel's previous films. I, for one, am excited for more Marvel movies in the future and how they will connect with Doctor Strange.",8,2,2,4 March 2017
Justice League," It's okay.
","You know what? I kinda', sort of, enjoyed Justice League. Aside from Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman, there isn't much character development so I really didn't find myself caring for the rest of the characters. Would have been nice for Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman to have had their own movies prior to Justice League but hey... I hear they're working on it.The story didn't really have any depth, its your typical bad guy wanting to take over the world and become more powerful while Bruce Wayne tries to assemble the Justice League team. Plenty of cheesy lines and predictability throughout. I felt that the pacing of the movie was too fast and next thing I knew, the movie was over. There was little to no backstory to the main villain so I didn't care for him either.Over all, Justice League was just an average eye-candy popcorn flick. It is nowhere near the level of The Dark Knight trilogy... but it isn't the worse movie I've ever seen either.I hope WB works on developing these characters much better for future movies, along with penning a script with more depth, to avoid failure should a sequel be made.",5,0,0,15 March 2018
It Chapter Two," IT was alright and worth a watch
","The first film felt so new, fresh and original. Horror movies nowadays lack originality but IT: Chapter One was like a breath of fresh air for the genre back in 2017. After seeing IT: Chapter Two, I can say I enjoyed the sequel but there were a few little things that took away from it being on par, or better, than the first.First off, I thought the originality, the creepiness, and the suspense from the first movie are almost gone in this sequel - it recycles a lot of the same horror concepts of the first one, making the movie a lot less creepy and much more predictable. You'll see just about every jump scare coming from a mile away, and you'll most likely to predict how those scenes turn out.This movie also had a lot more comedy than I thought it would. Most of the time, the crowd at my theater were either laughing, giggling or yawning. The comedy worked very well in the first film because the kids were just being kids - silly, witty, but entertaining to watch, but as adults, the goofiness felt a bit excessive.Don't let that sway you away from seeing the movie though.IT: Chapter Two is still a good little movie that focuses more on closing out each character's story arc. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd's Pennywise is still an excellent character whose presence and performance made me want to see more of. He probably could have used more screen time, come to think of it. The entire cast did a great job with what the script they were given - but there's no doubt that the script had room for a few tweaks here and there - along with plenty of room for improvements on the horror and suspense elements, especially considering that the movie had no problem pushing over two hours in length.IT's worth a watch, at least once.",7,1,3,7 September 2019
