Lucky Number Slevin," Pretentious drivel...
","Zero stars.This movie is the equivalent of the high school dork that returns from summer break with a slick new wardrobe, a cool car and looks the part of belonging to the in crowd. It's merely a mirage and sooner than later, the truth is revealed: the kid is still a dork (whether or not he grows up to be your boss is beside the point) and this movie is utter garbage.If you are a fan of overly-witty yet totally brainless, dried up and 'talk for the sake of talk' dialogue, then this movie is for you. There is nothing creative about it and the script alone is enough to sink the entire enterprise. If you like predictable, totally improbable and contrived plot elements that scream of filmmakers trying to prove that they are smarter than you, then they are, and the stupor you walk around in at all times will not be disturbed by this dim bulb of a train wreck.Save your money. Instead of opting for 'the best parts of Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects,' and whatever other films this one was undeservedly compared to, see the others. This movie will insult your sensibilities. Or not. In which case, enjoy it and don't forget to wear your helmet.",1,19,43,15 January 2007
