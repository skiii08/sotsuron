War Dogs," Boring to the point of putting you to sleep
","I think the title sums it up. Jonah Hill's laugh is annoying as anything and so is this movie. Hell, I'd say it's worse than Jared Leto's 'attempt' at the Joker laugh. Just like the laugh, the movie is a half-ass attempt at being as cool as Fight Club or Ocean's Eleven but all of it amounting to nothing other than being boring to the point of putting you to sleep.STORY & SCRIPT - The story is about two high-school friends who meet over a funeral after a long time. Miles Teller's character,David works as a masseuse and has an incredibly hot, Spanish girlfriend. You want logic here? Look away. As David can't make both ends meet Efron(Jonah Hill) offers a job in his company, so that he can support his family and also help Efron make the most out of the loop-holes in the American system. As this is based on a true story, I really can't say that which is more absurd, the plot or the story- telling. The script is woven over this plot, which sounds like a joke you tell at a party and everybody has a good laugh. But here, that joke is extended to a 2- hour long film full of phone-calls and talking and narration. There is so much narration that you will start thinking that why are they showing the film, just read the script and get it over with. DIRECTION - Now it is clear that Todd Phillips was indeed a one-time wonder with the Hangover. Maybe it was a stroke of luck or stroke of genius but it isn't working now. The levels of absurdity which was promised in the trailers are missing. Like I said, if you have to make a party-time joke into a movie, you better have the substance for it. The movie begins with a semi-dark-comedic tone and then it goes all dark and gloomy. This is in the first 40 minutes. The rest of the movie keeps going up and down regarding tone. It's all over the place. The characters aren't given time to build up. Few small, stereotypical, easily relatable situations and a truckload of narration. That's what the director used to establish the characters. On top of that, the movie suffers from the Suicide Squad syndrome. Songs everywhere. Just everywhere. There is a scene in the movie where three things are happening simultaneously:narration, characters talking and music playing. It was just horrible.ACTING - Other than Bradley Cooper's small role as a shady agent, everyone was what they are. Miles Teller was Miles Teller. There was no actual room for character building because of the exposition and narration by his character. Jonah Hill is awful. Either he is shouting too loud or he is laughing. I hate that laugh. If it was intentional, good job, Jonah because it really took me out of the movie.FINAL VERDICT - Give it a pass. It does boast of two of the youngest and finest actors right now in Hollywood but watch it if you want to know how stupid the American Defence system is. I mean, that's the only takeaway from this. You won't remember the characters, nor the story. Yes, you'll remember that laugh.",5,5,10,24 December 2016
Airlift," Hope in the darkest hours
","Very few Bollywood movies are as moving and stirring as Airlift. Due to Akshay Kumar movies like this are seeing the light of the day and are getting the publicity which is necessary for these kind of non-commercial movies. I am reducing one star from this movie only because of the songs. Bollywood's love of songs are very harmful to a serious movie, and in this case, a documentary. Real life doesn't have any songs and documentaries should also be treated the same so that we don't snap out of the serious moments in the movies.The movie is pretty much flawless. Akshay Kumar immerses himself completely into the character. Every year he makes one such movie which begs you to ask him personally that why does he make all those mindless comedies which have no cinematic value. If you rate him on the basis of his commercial movies you will definitely rate him a 3/10. Then he comes up with a 'Special 26' or 'Baby' and you are completely thrown off-balance. He lets go of all his mannerisms and digs deep and gives such a convincing performance. Actors like Nimrat Kaur, Poorab Kohli or Kumud Mishra are completely in their zone and are almost taken for granted that they are going to do well and they do well.The direction is flawless. The CGI in the war affected areas are used aptly. Often producers go cheap on small scenes like that and they take you out of the moment because you start searching for the flaws. The director Raja Menon, didn't go for much gore or display of devastation. Instead he trusted his actors to portray the helplessness through their performance. The work of the Indian Government has been both sneered and praised. It is almost like a wake-up call for the Government to do their job by citing an incident which had occurred 26 years ago. It is a wake-up call to humanity in general, showing us that even though evolution has made us smart and technologically advanced but what do we become during times of desperation. This movie shows us that there is hope during the darkest times and also that there is hope for Indian cinema to come out of the trend of commercial movies because the audience is maturing.",9,1,2,3 July 2016
The Hateful Eight," Another classic from Tarantino
","I have waited to watch this movie for a long time. As I hail from India and as the Indian Censor Board is so concerned about the 'Indian culture' being 'tainted' by Hollywood movies that they don't release R-rated movies in India, so I had to wait because the name of the game here is PATIENCE.This is one of the best movies set in an indoor set-up. The movie is claustrophobic. Each person has a past and Tarantino makes you feel you are there right inside Minnie's Habadashery. It's almost a amalgamation of Reservoir Dogs and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It's a FILM. A film which has been crafted with the care and respect with which movies should be made and I am always in awe that how confident Tarantino is that his concept of movies will always work, and it does. Nowadays movies have become short, to the point and in a way has shortened our tenacity to be patient but then comes Tarantino with a plot which keeps you at the edge of the seat. Well truth be said, the plot is very simple but it is the narration that keeps it interesting.The plot is that Sam L.Jackson is a retired war veteran turned bounty hunter who happens to come into the path of Kurt Russell who is taking a woman to hang. Due to a blizzard they have to make a pit stop at a inn so that they can wait till the blizzard passes by. At the inn waits 4 unknowns already, each of whose past is unknown. Sam and Kurt form a circle of trust as they start suspecting the four boarders in the inn.Everybody carries out their parts in the best manner but the whole movie mainly rests on the shoulders of Samuel L. Jackson. Watch the movie alone for a monologue by him. It is riveting. It made me crawl away from my laptop screen. I think Channing Tatum was a miscast in this perfectly made film. A better actor would have probably nailed the role within the given screen time.It is a Tarantino classic. If you have watched Tarantino's movies and are used to his style of movie making you are sure to love this one.",9,3,9,2 May 2016
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," three words- salute farhan salute!
","One of the most gritty, action-packed, emotional and inspiring biopic made in the history of Indian Cinema. From the fire of the pistol to the finishing line Rakesh Omprakash Mehra holds you onto the edge of the seat. You smile with the small Milkha. You clench your teeth when he runs with sore and bleeding feet. You cry with him. You singto his numbers. Farhan Akhtar becomes Milkha Singh in this biopic.I have never seen anybody work so hard to play a character. For me he is this year's best actor! The side roles chip in to this master piece. Divya Dutt stands out as the proud elder sister. Sonam needs to improve and a very smart cameo by the captain of the movie makes it a once in a lifetime experience.The songs come and go along well. Zinda and the title track bring you into pace with Farhan's 'Milkha'. Final verdict: Stop reading, Bhaag to your nearest theater to see the story unfold.",9,2,4,13 July 2013
Alien," Don't land on unknown PLANETS!!
","I am watching this movie in 2016 and still the practical effects almost made me puke. Ridley Scott's space horror is one for the classics. I have obviously watched many movies with gore and aliens and sometimes both but all of them try to force feed you. The set pieces don't seep in and the audience is made to jump from one gory situation to another. BUT this is Ridley Scott we are talking about. The one who started it all. I actually had watched Prometheus 1st and had a vague idea about the Alien franchise. Now after re-watching Alien I am beginning to connect the dots.The plot is probably known to everyone by now. So just skipping over that. Starting with the direction. The slow paced direction allows you to feel the atmosphere. The situation. It makes you understand the psyche of each of the crew members aboard the Nostromo. You start to care and while watching it I often wished to not get emotionally involved because I knew what was to follow. The face-hugger scenes was much more creepy and disgusting than when the Alien arrives, because the Alien is shown in the dark and mysterious. So the effect of the goriness is only understood when the witnesses arrive but the face-hugger is on screen. It is puke-worthy. The acting was very natural. The lines almost seemed unscripted. The equation between all the crew members was very evident from the beginning. I should seen through the fact that Ash was an android but it was well hinted throughout the film. It is very subtle. So subtle that you are bound to miss . As I said, the pacing is very steady. You'll feel the fear. The set-design is amazing. All in all it was a enjoyable movie. Ridley Scott is the master of space oriented movies.Final warning. IF ANY ASTRONAUT IS READING THIS AND WANTS TO SPACE TRAVEL, DON'T LAND ON UNKNOWN PLANETS",10,4,6,15 May 2016
Doctor Strange," Combo of magic and action
","Finally the presence of a multiverse and the inclusion of magic happens in the MCU. Please read this review considering the fact that I happen to have not read many comic books due to the lack of comic book stores in this little town in India and that my knowledge of Dr.Strange is limited to what was shown in the Amazing Spiderman series and the comics that come in the Daily Telegraph. Pardon me if I write something that is inaccurate according to the comics.I am huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and I was very excited when he was included in the MCU. I knew how much he didn't want to portray a superhero but I am glad he did. He looks the part and acts the part, though I have a few gripes. Not regarding his acting but his characterization. Without further adieu allow me to expand my mind and extract all that I witnessed.DIRECTION - I have liked Scott Derrickson's 'Sinister' and 'Deliver us from Evil'. He doesn't disappoint here either except, and I am sorry, the ending. I'll get to that later. Considering that this is an origin story in the middle of a long line of movies, whose characters have already been well established, nothing felt rushed. The magic was shown beautifully. Since the time the trailers dropped, many were comparing the visuals to Inception, but it really isn't. Yes, there is a similarity but the mind-bending, building bending scenarios are just amazing. Calling it the same as Inception is just insulting. The chase sequence is so intricate that I have to see multiple times to fully understand what is going on in the background. The jokes felt a bit out of place sometimes. It's OK to disagree, it is a personal thing. The 'mister doctor' scene was funny in the trailers and I was anticipating it, but then when Kaecilius stabbed the guardian right after that, it was just confusing. Why would you do that? Do you want me to laugh or sympathize? Strange's character is similar to Stark because he is also arrogant and probably that's why it was shown that he was cracking so many jokes. I hope in the subsequent movies he gets more serious to match his persona of Sorcerer Supreme.ACTING - When you get some of the most gifted actors, there could be no complaints about that. Benedict's Strange is funny, compassionate, witty and a very apt portrayal as far as I am concerned. Many were complaining about the accent, but it is negligible. Rachel McAdams has limited screen-time, but shines through and through. Again, glad Marvel roped her in too. Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, according to me should have got some more interactions with either Strange or the other characters. It is a compliment because I wanted to see more of her. I had read that Mordo is a villain but from the trailers I was a bit confused seeing him in such a good avatar. Then I thought that Chiwetel Ejiofor wouldn't have come in if Mordo would have been reduced to a side- role. This also serves as an origin story for Mordo and it will be great to see Chiwetel against Benedict. Benedict Wong as Wong is a strong and compelling and even though there wasn't much of him, you know that he will have a far more stretched out role in the future. Mad Mikkelsen probably strolled through this role as Kaecilius. He had a very one dimensional villainous role and that's why I think his acting potential was under used.STORY and SCRIPT - Again, please pardon me if I am being inaccurate. As this is an origin story, I was expecting him to become Sorcerer Supreme by the end of the movie, but was glad that they didn't go that way. The jokes felt a bit out of place. I know Marvel tends to be funny but I think now they should just let it go. We can handle dark and sad moments. You have trained us well, Marvel Studios. Now, the ending felt kinda REPETITIVE. HAHA! Didn't see that coming did you? It felt like the ending of Fantastic Four 2 , where a huge monster like thing, which has been built up for the whole movie, doesn't exactly deliver. I know we are supposed to consider that that movie don't exist but it did feel like that. It felt like a cheap cop-out. I am just happy that in the future, Strange will be facing off against Mordo and as Mordo's character has been established, we will be able understand the reason behind his actions.FINAL VERDICT - My final thoughts are that Marvel has a formula and it looks like it worked again, though I hope in the subsequent movies they could pull back on the jokes. It is very entertaining, action heavy and stunning visuals. Go watch it and enjoy.Additional thoughts -I am a bit sad that people are still walking out before the post and mid-credit scenes. Haven't you learnt already? It's a tradition. It allows you to look at the names behind the magic and also you get to see what's next. Just, please, sit and watch.",7,3,6,4 November 2016
The Revenant," Speechless
","I have just watched the movie. I have marinated the movie in my laptop for a long time because the movie hadn't come to my theater so I had to wait for the Blu-Ray rip. Even after that I was afraid that I will end up not liking it. At long last I have watched the movie. It was amazing. Just amazing.I will start with the direction. Amazing. Excellent. Alejandro has shown how to use a basic plot and muscle it up with emotions, because it is a very emotion-driven plot. Most of the plot-lines in our real life are not that dynamic but they are important to us because our emotions are attached with it. Alejandro showed that.The cinematography. Amaze-balls. What should I say about it? It is indescribable. The flow of the movie is very smooth. The CGI is used very efficiently i.e. only where required. I have heard that there was no artificial lighting, so under that conditions putting up such a beautiful looking movie is no easy job.NOW, the acting. Domnhall Gleeson plays the weak and timid captain. I always thought of him as a timid guy until I saw Star Wars:The Force Awakens. He shows he is capable of everything. Tom Hardy. Tom Hardy. The guy shows so little but every emotion and dialogues are transcended through his eyes. Finally, Leonardo DiCaprio. WHOOOOF! The guy is his own competition. He just makes a movie and then tops that and keeps topping that. There is no stopping Leo. 90% of the movie, Leo is on screen and he shows what he is capable of. After the 1st half he rarely talks because he was mauled by a frigging bear. It's all expressions after that. I could go on and on. As there is a saying that better late than never so ya, he was awarded the Oscar at the right moment, for the right movie and for unparalleled acting. I very much doubt that anybody can match up to this level of acting. Leo, hats off!",10,2,6,29 April 2016
Dangal," wins hearts and the gold
","If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down.SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light- hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary.DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character.FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack- lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide- shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication.ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie.FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016.",10,3,5,12 January 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Captain Iron-Man
","You might be wondering why the strange title. It is because I went in thinking which side to support, but it was never about that. It was about understanding the wrongs in both sides and making amends. This movie is probably the best movie which has come out of Marvel's long list of movies. Major credits goes to the Russo Brothers and to the casting director for bringing together such an amazing cast. It is awesome to see your childhood super-heroes being portrayed on screen by these people who are all on their A-game.I actually have nothing to criticize, which is evident from my rating but if I allow myself to be a nit-picky then I can only say that Vision was supposed to be a deus ex-machina, just like Wanda and I think he was under-played a bit, a bit, just a bit. With that off the list, now I can talk about all the things I loved.I loved the action set-pieces. They are not just hollow and CGI jizzing. It is emotionally driven due to which you feel the pain of the punches and you actually care. The length of the movie is long on paper but the length has been used so efficiently to show-case every character and put very necessary plot-lines. There is a good balance of light and dark. Baron Zemo being the darkest of them all. Even though we don't see him suit up but he plays the most darkest element in the movie. He is almost an organization himself. Daniel Bruhl knocks it out of the park. We have two new inclusions on the hero side, Black Panther and Spider-man. They are the show stoppers. I have seen Chadwick Boseman in '42'. He plays T'challa like a boss. He shows how even a King can do dangerous things when driven by vengeance. Tom Holland's Spider- man is probably the most comic accurate Spidey we are getting on screen. We have always wanted his one-liners during a fight scene and it is incorporated in it very well.The rest of the Avengers' cast has always done excellent. Robert Downey Jr. is probably irreplaceable as Iron-Man, and that is saying something. Marvel will obviously find a replacement but it won't be RDJ level good. He is fantastic. Chris Evans has always looked the part but in this movie he looks to be at his most vulnerable state. He suffers many losses and Bucky being the last link to his past life, he pulls all the stops to hold on to him. Sebastian Stan takes on the iron hand and punches his way through the movie. Mackie, Bettany, Olsen, Renner, Cheadle, Scarlett all reprise their roles and they are excellent. Like I say, nothing to criticize. Paul Rudd being one of the underdogs in the whole cast, according to me was also born to be Ant-Man. His role is not as big as Wolverine's or Deadpool's so nobody is talking about it but Paul is amazing and has come a long way from playing generic comedic characters.I can probably right an essay on the film and still it'll not be enough. So I'll just say GO WATCH THE MOVIE. It is awesome.",10,35,63,8 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," Wear a diaper in-case you are easily scared.
","A sincere thank you to James Wan for reviving the franchise after the debacle called 'Annabelle'. James Wan is probably the only director currently in Hollywood who is capable of making a believable horror film. The genre which is just full of either horror-comedy or horror gore was really becoming boring before Conjuring. It was becoming boring but then comes Conjuring 2. James Wan is a messiah of the horror genre.Not going to talk about the plot but I am going to say this that a good horror movie doesn't need loud noises to build up a scene and James Wan knows that. Every build up scene in this movie just has the breathing of the characters or the noises on the wooden floors or a creepy chime music. That's all and BOOM!. The acting is very believable. Especially the little girl. Patrick and Vera are exceptional. The main crux of a horror movie is that you are not scared of the ghost or demon but you are scared for the characters and the imminent threat looming on them. If you don't care for the characters then a horror movie is a lost cause. You care about the Warrens and that keeps you hooked to every dark room, every whisper around them. I had a little problem with some jokes in the movie which I think could have been avoided but it's fine.It is refreshing to watch a good horror movie and I would urge you to go alone if you want the full thrill of this movie.",7,0,2,22 June 2016
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," There is and will be only one MSD
","The man we know, the story we don't. Dhoni and his story is worth being made as a movie and thank you Neeraj Pandey for bringing our Captain Cool onto the big screen with such finesse.Starting with the acting performances, Sushant Singh Rajput probably got his dream role and he doesn't leave an inch where you can point out that was overdone or wasn't like Dhoni. He has absorbed each and every nuance of Dhoni and has become a replica and as most are saying, the amount of practice that he has done he does deserve to play for the Indian team, even if it is a charity match alongside the real Dhoni. Every character has been cast with extreme care and all of them do their job very well. Disha Patani does seem a bit cold but considering this is her 1st movie she can be given a pass.Coming to the direction, Neeraj Pandey gives a emotionally driven biopic. The 1st half is filled with how Dhoni was before he became MSD right from his childhood to puberty to adulthood. The problem is with the 2nd half which feels a bit stretched but as it is important phases of his life it wouldn't have been fair if it wasn't shown. It just adds to his character and makes us feel how much Dhoni can actually take before breaking down, and boy it's a lot. Editing is almost seamless. Very nice use of minimal graphics to put Sushant in Dhoni's placeMy final verdict: There are many reasons to not watch this, you may not like cricket or you may not like Dhoni, you may not like biopics, you may think he got it too soon. There is only one reason to watch this and that is Mahendra Singh Dhoni. If you love the guy and respect what he has done for the Indian cricket team I'll urge you to go watch it because there is and will be only one Mahendra Singh Dhoni.",8,1,2,8 October 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," X-men:Gods from Egypt
","I think the critics from Rotten Tomatoes left the movie in the first half hour or were just jerking off to Storm. She was hot though. Not going to lie.X-men Apocalypse. Third in the prequel series. So the whole scenario takes place soon after the events of DC. Humans and Mutants have started to bond together whereas in rural parts, mutants are still hated upon and are used as circus freaks. The advent of the 1st mutant known as En Sabah Nur has put the existence of humans in jeopardy and it's center are the X-men and the Four recruits of Apocalypse.The story is fairly simple. A dark mutant who has transferred his consciousness from time to time and has wreaked havoc when ever humans grew stronger than the mutants. This time he is back again and he goes on to recruit his four followers so that he can get back to being the ruler of the world. The only people who are going to stop him are the X-men. So on one side Apocalypse begins to recruit Storm, Angel, Psylocke and finally Magneto. He enhances their powers to make them almost invincible. On the other side we are introduced to the ones who are going to become the X-men. I'll give it points for not stopping to show how each of them are recruited. Everything keeps flowing in a parallel time-line. Apocalypse comes to know about Xavier and his power and he understands that he is his next vessel because through him he can control humans and mutants alike.The pacing of the movie is not very fast to be true. It takes a lot of time to bring us to the midst of things. I had a major problem with the placement of the humorous scenes and the sad scenes. One of them was the death of Alex Summers. We get this next awesome QuickSilver scene and right after that Alex is dead. The humour doesn't seep in and that is why we can't exactly sympathize with Scott because his brother has just died. One of the emotionally strong scenes was the death of Erik's family. The scene was also reminiscent of a scene from 'Guardians of the Galaxy' but obviously more riveting. Plot points like Stryker shows up to take away Mystique, Beast, Moira and Silver seemed a little forced so that we can get the cameo of the Wolverine and yes, so that they can get a jet. One of the most down-points of the movie was Apocalypse. His presence wasn't as deadly as it should have been. The apocalypse of the world took way too much time. If he had made the four horsemen to go to different parts of the world(because he travel from one place to another) and made them cause destruction that would have posed a much more of a challenge for the X-men.Acting wise almost every one is on their A-game. Now we have another funny man on the X-men, NightCrawler. He was aptly characterized. In the comics he was always quipping, but not very smart things. He really stole the show. Sophie Turner more or less plays a mutant Sansa. I liked the new Scott. Olivia Munn hardly talked in the whole movie but she looked great. The new Storm will be good in the upcoming movies. Jennifer Lawrence is Raven Everdeen(hope that is self explanatory). Returning actors like McAvoy and Fassbender and Hoult are amazing as usual. Fassbender a bit more especially because of that scene in the forest. Angel's character was forgettable and he died too, so that's that. Stan Lee doesn't have a funny cameo this time. Oscar Isaac was tremendously under used. I know he is a great actor and he plays negative roles very well but this just didn't click for me. Hugh Jackman will be missed considering that cameo. Hope we could have had at least 10 more movies of him as Wolverine.The movie is not anything epic because the standards are just getting higher and higher. It definitely propagates the plot forward but doesn't satisfy considering it is almost an end-of-the-world movie. First Class also had the destruction of the world in it's center and it had more stakes and more heart than here where there is a God trying to cause destruction. I am happy that the new lot of actors portraying the iconic characters from our childhood will do it justice and hope upcoming sequels solidify the X-men universe better",7,3,9,20 May 2016
Don't Breathe," Mentally unstable Daredevil in the house
","Rob a blind war-veteran's house, how hard is that going to be you think? Well, if it's this guy you think you want to rob, you better give it another thought. Fede Alvarez rebooted or remade (one of the two) Evil Dead and now he comes up with this?! He is the master of R-rated thriller/horror, no doubt about that. If you have read till here but haven't watched the movie yet,I'd suggest you to go watch the movie 1st. It will definitely be worth it. Then come read this, this review ain't going anywhere. Those who have watched it though, carry on.DIRECTION - Even though Evil Dead didn't receive any critical acclaim but I absolutely loved it. Fede Alvarez knows how to mix music, lighting and believable characters and serve it as a beautiful dish. Well, by the end of the movie I don't think so the word 'beautiful' will hold up but you know what I mean. I was kind of confused with the opening shot. I thought, why show the conclusion? Now, I know what is going to happen? Then when you give it a few more minutes and things start to roll and take shape you forget about the ultimate consequence and get way too invested. The last time I was so invested in a horror/thriller movie was the Descent. I was absolutely shattered at the final reveal in that movie and it happened again with this one. The movie did falter at places like the characterisation. There is always a douche, a damsel and the hero character. The trick is to humanise them and make them believable. The damsel is a mixture of a damsel and a hero and the hero is a mix of damsel and hero. Well the douche is still a douche. The ending particularly is amazing. If you pause the movie at the right moment, you can see him standing right there. I think.CINEMATOGRAPHY - Right from the aerial shot in the beginning of the movie, you know the movie is going to have the right tone. The colour grading is perfect. Most of the movie is in low light, dim light and even no light. Pedro Luque deserves a standing ovation for his amazing work. It is very difficult to capture claustrophobia and invoke that feeling in the audience even though you are not claustrophobic. I can't praise his work enough. I am actually using one of the shots in the movie as the featured image because it is that amazing. Marvel needs a good cinematographer. Just saying. Here is a guy. TAKE HIM ALREADY!!ACTING - I tip my imaginary hat to Stephen Lang. I haven't seen much of him after Avatar but man that was something. Psychotic, strong, unhinged, ferocious and I am still defining his character. He is Stick, Daredevil, Logan and Batman all mixed up into one. It was amazing. He has very few lines and he does some amazing job without saying anything. Great job by the young cast of Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette. They started very wooden and clichéd but right after the action started they brought on their A-game.FINAL VERDICT - Certainly going up in my Top 10 movie list. I love movies that leave you disturbed. I mean if it intends to do so then you should feel disturbed or else the movie hasn't done it's job. Definitely, definitely watch it. I can't emphasise this enough. It's so great to see so many different kinds of movies being made. The movie is so well balanced between two dark sides and you feel morally obligated to choose a side. I love the mental duel that a movie provides and through this process it reminds the audience and film-makers the craft of engaging the audience while also creating a great movie.",9,8,17,26 December 2016
The Witch," Slow burners are not for everyone.
","Before watching this movie I happened to watch 'Rosemary's Baby' and I found it to be the perfect horror movie. Not the cheap jump scary type but the type that will make you writhe inside and haunt your dreams. THIS was that type of a movie. There were no cheapness in the movie. The movie knew what it was and if you like jump-scares and gore. Avoid this or make up your mindset to watch this.After all that, you might be wondering why the 7 star rating, because I didn't enjoy it entirely. I am not saying it is not good but probably, I wanted more. Let's discuss pros and cons, keep in mind, it is from my personal view-point.PROS- Acting wise, Anya was on point. She was very believable as the helpless girl in a strange time. Ralph Ineson, I loved his voice. I loved how he played a father with flaws. Dickie as the weeping mother with high superstitions and always irritated with Thomasin was nice. The cinematography was awesome. It completely captured the darkness of a time fueled by superstitions. I will give kudos to the director for choosing to make a horror film which is extremely difficult considering how horror movies are made nowadays.CONS- The child actors playing Caleb and the twins didn't have the acting to pull off their characters. Probably they should have been given lesser screen time. I wanted more of the witch or at-least a back story as to how the lore of the witch had started. Not an origin story but a 15-minute intro couldn't have hurt. The goat totally put me off. I tried to be serious when I saw the goat but I accept it. Goats are my weakness.All in all. It is a fresh inclusion to the horror genre and other horror movie directors can take notes from it. If you want to watch this movie, trust me, watch it alone. You will enjoy it. DON'T eat anything before or while watching it. You may have urges to puke.",7,2,5,8 May 2016
Rosemary's Baby," Guidebook to Horror Film-making
","Well by now everyone will be familiar with the plot-line. A happy couple moves into an apartment and the room which they get belonged to that of a woman who died there of old age. They get acquainted with their neighbors and since then things start to get murky.I am watching this in 2016 and I was scared of watching this movie given the rating it holds. I am used to the horror movies that are made nowadays which hold a maximum rating of 6.5 and not more than that. I was also afraid that I will not like the movie and considering the fact that I am a movie lover, it would be really sad to not like it because it is a classic. The meaning of classic is that it is not tainted by time. It just becomes better.I haven't seen the actors so I know little of them. They were fantastic. The movie was centered on Rosemary, so it was important that the audience feels sad for the condition of Rosemary and the actress makes us feel for her. Guy is conflicted about what he is doing and he shows it in every decision he takes. He is just one bad moment from bursting out. Other side-roles are average, a bit stereo-typed, especially the neighbors.The story is pretty straight forward and the best thing is that the reveal is slow. We are confused that what is real and what is not. The dream-sequences really make you go dizzy. It is a slow burner but the pace is worth it. You are almost forced to rush to the end but then something pulls you back to stay alongside Rosemary till the end. I enjoyed it immensely. I think horror movies should be made like this instead of investing in jump scares and gore. The only movie that comes even remotely close is 'The Conjuring', but considering the amount of jump scares and CGI moments it has, I'll say there are not many true horror movies that come close to 'Rosemary's Baby'",9,0,1,4 May 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," The dust never settles
","I saw the trailer, I saw the cast, I saw who the directors were and I was interested to see how the whole plot plays out. The plot is pretty simple. Eddie Mannix(Josh Brolin) is the head of the production company Capitol Studios. One of his lead actor, Baird Whitlock(George Clooney) gets kidnapped by script writers who wants payback for the stories which they have not been paid for by the production company. Now to every simple plot there has to be a to and fro to keep the audience interested, but the to and fro shouldn't move away from the heart of the story. Here there is so much motion and that the movie never settles. Too many loose ends. Personally for me that was a major problem. My mind never settled. Probably, it was the intention of the directors to not let your mind settle so that we can feel the rush felt by the producer. But it didn't quite work for me.No complains about the cast. Though, Channing Tatum should move his facial muscles a bit more. It was unclear what he was going for. It is nice to see Jonah Hill starring in movies with such big names in it. George Clooney plays the gullible Baird. You almost begin to sympathize with him at the end. I have always liked Josh Brolin. No complains. Other than them, Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton have extended cameos. Due to which none of their characters settle down. Alden Ehrenreich is pretty good as the person who is a cow-boy on and off screen.The tone of the movie is well held throughout. It clearly shows that all that glitters is not gold. We only see the final product but we always don't get to see the cogs in the wheel. The hustle and bustle makes you dizzy and that is why we love the world of cinema",7,0,1,11 May 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Honest and fresh review
","This is a fresh review because I have just come after seeing the movie.RIGHT NOW. So the imprint of the movie is fresh in my mind and I am honestly going to say that this movie is a beautiful mess. I haven't seen any other review. I haven't seen any spoilers and I walked into the theater knowing only what the trailers had shown. First, I am going to talk about the pros that are in this movie. The movie is shot beautifully. Every scene is breathtaking. The CGI is as expected of Zack Snyder. The actions scenes are awesome. If the Man of Steel action scenes were 8/10 then the action scenes in this movie is 10/10. Exhilarating, adrenaline pumping action scenes. All the haters of Batfleck can zip their mouths shut because Ben Affleck gave a towering performance as Bruce Wayne as well as Batman. I had a little problem with the Batman part but I'll come to that later. Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne shows his humane side because of the incident at Metropolis. He's Emotionally vulnerable because the loss of Metropolis is still fresh in his mind. Apparently the Bruce Wayne he is portraying has been through a lot so it is understandable.Jeremy Irons as the new Alfred is a breath of fresh air. He is more grounded and handy just like you see in the trailers. I remember one scene from the comics where Alfred takes a pill which enhances his strength and beats up Superman for hurting Bruce Wayne and I can totally see Jeremy Irons' Alfred doing that to Henry Cavill's Superman. Henry Cavill as Superman is the best we have got since Christopher Reeves. Does he surpass his performance? According to me, yes. As we haven't seen any recent renditions of Wonder Woman I think Gal Gadot is promising. As a DC universe is being created I think she will fit in very good. Human characters like Lois, Perry and Martha Kent have enough screen time and are good. There are cameos by the members who will be forming the JLA. Jonathan Kent also pays a visit. Now for the cons. Considering the run-time the film was a tad bit lengthy because of the script. Apparently Hollywood is still suffering from the Spider-man syndrome. That is, they are so busy building up for the sequels that they do not concentrate on the current premise. There are too many things going on in this movie. At first it looks like they are setting up for the Batman vs Superman throw down but then you see the Doomsday part coming up which scared me right when I saw it. It proved to be right. The second half is just a big CGI mess. The Batman and Superman fight is awesome and according to me they should have built the story arc like that so that it would have ended with the fight BUT they had to bring the Dawn of bloody Justice.Doomsday looks like Shrek on the juice that made Bane grow big in Batman and Robin. They took too many references. I think it is an amalgamation of The Dark Knight Returns and Death of Superman and it turned out to be not according to the expectations. Now the thing about Batman. Dude was killing right and left! I mean you could say they were rubber bullets but he drove his car through the car which apparently had the bad guys in it. BATMAN DOESN'T KILL. I hope they have a explanation for that. Now you see I haven't put Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor in the pros because it wasn't. He was towering and menacing but those were very brief moments. Otherwise he just comes out as a mockery of many goofy characters. He just didn't come out of his comfort zone to do something different. All in all the movie was OK. Probably the wait and expectation had built too much hype.",6,4,10,24 March 2016
Deadpool," Sincere Comic Book Adaptation
","I have read Deadpool comics. I have played the Deadpool game and I have seen him being adapted in some animated movies and series. I have done all this after X-men Origins:Wolverine. There was a severe outrage about the portrayal of Deadpool in that movie and I had to dig deeper to understand the reason for this outrage and I understood the character and Deadpool's bio in short is 'Merc with a mouth', so why did they sow his mouth SHUT?Moving on, I think the movie is so perfect because the producers didn't restrain the director and writers from doing anything and the director and writer did a BANG on job in making this movie. The plot is simple that is why the narration is to and fro. Most of the references were understandable and extremely well placed within the movie. Me being an Indian, missed some so I had to Google some of them and I laughed after understanding them. The dialogues were bang on. Character development, unexpectedly, was there.Now to the acting. I suppose side characters are not even necessary because you have Ryan Reynolds playing Deadpool. It feels like he was born to be Deadpool and after knowing all the hard-work he has done to get this movie made and when you see his portrayal of the merc-with-a-mouth, satisfaction is guaranteed.All in all for me, this is the most perfect adaptation of a comic book character and every movie should be made like this. I am not saying every movie should be made r-rated but it should be made as the comic book writers had made them and as the readers had grown with the characters. One other plus point is that I think this movie was made as a stand-alone movie. After the success the sequels are being planned. Making a movie to support a franchise always ruins it as a movie itself(You know what I am talking about, chiki- chikaaaaaa)",10,1,9,28 April 2016
