10 Cloverfield Lane," unpredictable turn-around but a little silly. still enjoyable.
","Literally I rushed to theater to see this movie by riding a bike after long time like 12 hours work. Usually I checked this site before I go to see a movie. Thankfully, most of movies come out a little bit later in Korea than in America. Many reviewers said this movie is good one but I'd like to tell you 'don't get your hope too high' because you will be overwhelmed by last a few times. I don't want to write my review in detailed, especially for this movie. for the sake of your time and money, don't try to get some information of this movie. Just go and enjoy. The less you know, the more you will enjoy. Im not sure every one likes the later part of this move. I laughed out loud right after movie ended. Im pretty sure most of people like the first part. It was very suspense and involving. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I kept thinking to myself what was gonna happen next.",7,0,2,10 April 2016
