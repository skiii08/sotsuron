Black Swan," A master-piece-of-trash
","First of all gave it a 5 because I only give 4 or less to 'amateur' movies.You start the movie with high expectations from the reviews and the critics, you read something about a character that has to find her 'dark' side to play a role, and change her personality, even though you're not a big fan of ballet, you see the reviews and Oscars, and you give it a try expecting at least, if not something of your type, something of high quality, or some emotionally strong drama.Let me tell you what I saw in this movie, a (pretty) woman with the same expression the entire movie, throwing up every 5 minutes, bleeding, ripping some skin or showing her rash every 2 minutes, and having hallucinations every 5 seconds. Thats how amazing this movie is. 'Her facial expression never varies from sad, purse-mouthed and leaky eyed. I got so tired of looking at her face and it is shown just about all the time.' said another reviewer (in words I hardly understand), well I hope this is not a spoiler, but basically thats what you will see the entire movie: her face! and even thou she is pretty it can be very annoying and at some point you might feel some desire to slap her.So basically for me, this movie has hardly any positive points, besides keeping you waiting for some interesting moment that never comes, it is a succession of confusing, meaningless scenes, that sometimes resemble a horror movie, very based in all the clich√©s and as the movie goes on starts becoming more like a comedy. No substance, no emotional depth, no strong/well-built characters, no point. Even visually this movie fails.Like i read somewhere 'pretentious garbage' is a nice way to describe it, but of course, you add some classical music mix it with some ballet, wrap it all up with a lot of cheap sex, and all the so called 'intellectuals' can only call it a sublime masterpiece, or else they will probably be expelled from the so-called-intellectuals club. This movie shows very small traces of intelligence, and I don't mean to sound arrogant.Avoid it, either you into ballet or not, in all honesty it is not a terrible movie, is decent, but is definitely a waste of time, and the most overrated movie of 2011 along with Inception (no wonder I saw both on the same list of the best 3 movies).",4,2,6,23 April 2011
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," As good as possible.
","Horror and Comedy? Seems impossible to be scared an laugh at the same time, seems to me like a waste of time idea. Tucker and Dale went as far as possible. Maybe not far enough, you probably wont laugh enough neither you be scared enough, but this creative movie did the best possible to mix this two elements. Apart from that you will probably fall in love with this two characters, and would be great to see some kind of series with Tucker and Dale, I want to see more from them they create a 'perfect' match and their relation is alone worth the watching. I give it 8 not because I enjoyed SO MUCH but because they did the best possible and were creative and innovative.",8,0,1,4 June 2012
