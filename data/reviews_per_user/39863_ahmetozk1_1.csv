Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Primitive scenes
","I had great expectations from this movie. However, I was disappointed at rather absurd behaviors of Borat on primitive scenes. The same topic could have been put in a realistic framework with more subtle humors. In Turkey, we have seen wonderful examples of Turkish comedy movies on the differences between rural and city cultures.So I can say that comedy movies generally produce more profound effects when they depict real scenarios. The use of nudity added more to the clumsiness of the movie. Borat's offbeat swimming suit did not even fit into the local culture in which it was supposed to be worn. His chasing of Azamat in total nudity had no entertaining spirit in it. While the movie greatly lacks artistic value and realism, it can also be considered rather humiliating for Kazakhstan, which I suppose could produce no such idiotic anchorman.",4,3,7,1 December 2006
