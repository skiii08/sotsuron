Mission: Impossible III," This was pleasantly different
","Why they allowed John Woo to get hold of Mission Impossible II is a mystery. He's only interested in how high the flaming petrol flume can get after his amateur explosions. He needs to go to a battlefield or tank firing range to learn about what a real explosion looks like.J.J. Abrams - what a genius. M.I.3 kept me on the edge of my seat, I wish I hadn't delayed watching it because of the mess John Woo had made of M.I.2.Again, Tom Cruise showed that he could create tension just by the emotion on his face. The great cast of supporting actors and the twists in the tale made this an unmissable movie.",10,1,3,16 October 2006
