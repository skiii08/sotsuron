It," IT wasn't disappointing
","'It,' originally written by Stephen King is one of the best horro storylines that I've come across. Stephen King is one of my favorite author because I love horror movies and stories. I watched this movie with my ex when it first came out and he was scared out of his mind. He hates horror movies and super scared. I was laughing at him the entire time eating my popcorn and enjoying the movie and its plot. I loved how Pennywise came at all of the children differently and individually pulling out their greatest fear and showing the audience more about the characters themselves. It showed character development throughout the movie how the children got over their fears and pushed through for the better of their friends and ultimately taking one for the team. The actor who played Pennywise was undoublty wonderful and scary and no one could have played it better. His mannerisms and the little actions he displayed made him even scarier than just his appearance. The actors who played the children did an amazing job displaying innocence and being naive to every situation. The script, story, and action was perfect nop doubt about it. There were so many people in the audience that I hear screaming over and over again because the horror was just that good! The movie did a very good job at keeping up with he book and being loyal to Stephen King. Although the movie was only 135 minutes long and it moved by quickly, time flies by when you're having fun.The negative movie reviews states that theres no characters development, no bond of friendship and it wasn't clear if the m0vie was supposed to be funny or scary? IT CAN BE BOTH. And there was character development. The girl was distant from all of them and they bonded over fighting pennywise despite their greatest fears! I think you have to be pretty blind to say that they were no character development and that the movie wasn't good at all. Obviously a movie can be more than once genre. Yes the movie was advertised to be a horror scary movie but that doesn't mean it can't be funny at all. Many people said that they were disappointed because the trailer overhyped it and so did many other people. They backed this statement up with saying the film had shitty scripts and shitty actors. This claim has got to be weak and unthoughtful. This film is based on Stephen Kings classic book. One of the best horror writers of all time probably the best writers in general of all time despite his choice of genre. IT was as realistic as possible, in scare wise. Although there weren't that many jumping scares there was a lot of build up, the sketchy environment, and the uncertainty of the kids. Not once was I unconvinced of their fear and what they were feeling of the torment of Pennywise. This movie had to have been good because of the lasting outcome of people talking about how they wanted to be the cast of IT for Halloween. Or how everything Pennywise and It related was sold out of stores on Halloween.'It' is a movie worth watching to those who are into comedy and/or horror. 'It' is a good movie overall because it was well written....duh. 'It' is a movie consisting of a couple of kids facing their deepest darkest fears individually trying to come to a conclusion as to why and how a kid in their neighborhood was killed. They come together as friends and make new friends to figure out this murder/his disappearance. They came together despite their differences and put bits and pieces together. While finding clues one of the friends was abducted too.. While trying to find clues something haunts the kids and brings out their deepest and dearest fears trying to make the kids scared and scare them off hoping to scare the kids enough to call off their search to find out what happened to their friend. In the end they put together all of their clues and fight off Pennywise the clown and find out what's happened to their friends. The ending to me was kina gay and could've been better.",7,0,2,9 March 2018
