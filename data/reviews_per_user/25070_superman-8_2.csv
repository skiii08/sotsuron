Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's like Star Wars 'light'. Think Star Wars with Muppets.
","Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie. It borders on great at times. But it's no Star Wars (ep. 4). It's a LucasProduct, and holds up to those lofty standards...and yeah, the special effects were spectacular, the lightsaber duels with Maul were most impressive, as were the pod race and space battle sequences. But the first 20 minutes left me wondering if I'd wandered into some strange Star Wars/Muppet Show bastard hybrid. The aliens in particular were extremely hard to understand in some scenes that you couldn't read their lips as well. Is it kid friendly? You bet your ass it is. Definite PG, not PG-13... which is fine, but it seemed a bit light on substance and, uh, pathos? It's hard to feel sympathetic for countless scores of robots getting shredded. *BUT* for all that...it's a solidly *good* movie. (but NOT great...only parts of it are.)",9,0,0,22 May 1999
The Mummy," Heh. Indiana Jones meets slapstick and camp. You gotta love it.
","The Mummy? If you only saw the previews for it, you'd think it was a SPFX-filled horror flick. If you go to see it, your perceptions will be adjusted to see that it's a SPFX-filled campy comedy-type filled flick *tinged* with horror. Think: Indiana Jones meets, oh, not quite the 3 Stooges, but close. It basically brings back the feeling of the campy Saturday afternoon 'horror' flicks - with a lot more humor. Admittedly, some of the scenes were downright creepy - flesh-devouring beetles (that you never really see doing such, it's only 99% implied), ghouls crawling rapidly after the good guys - down the sides of the walls, that sort of thing. But this film is so peppered with 1-liners, staged comedic spills and the like, it's very difficult to take as a pure horror flick - or to stop your lips from splitting open in a hearty belly laugh. Brendan Fraser parodies Indiana Jones wonderfully - with more humor, smugness, and dare I say it, giggly attempts at romance. People might slam his performance, but I'd say it's as solid as Keanu 'Huh?' Reeves in 'The Matrix' (is that a bad thing to say here? I don't think so.) Rachel Weisz puts on a great performance as the slightly-off-kilter knowledgeable Egyptologist, and has a handful of priceless 1-liners and slapstick scenes in points...and Arnold Vosloo... well...for a pretty minimalist acting job, I thought his screen charisma and presence stood out pretty strongly. I'd second other people's thoughts here in that he looked a lot like Billy Zane in 'The Phantom'. He did! Able supporting cast, creepy opportunist-turned-darkside's-evil-henchman played aptly by Kevin O'Connor...great scenery, wonderfully designed sets...and did I mention the SPFX yet??? :) It all ends predictably enough, but it's an enjoyable ride - and one that will bring more laughs to your face than you expect. Dunno if it's worth buying on DVD, but plunk down your $X and see this movie - it's a nice piece of lighter fare which could balance out your diet of serious, grimmer stuff (Matrix) or larger-than-life wanna-be legends (Star Wars Ep. 1)...etc. Check it out.",8,0,0,3 June 1999
