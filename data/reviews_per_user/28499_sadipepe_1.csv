United 93," Interesting way of presenting the story
","It took me a long time to process this film. It has almost a flat affect, and it is so unlike anything I've seen before. Even in documentary form. And it was quite strange to see a film about something so serious, so galling and absolutely devastating, presented so clinically.But now that I've had a day to think about it, I've decided that I really appreciate the way Mr. Greengrass made the film. His method treats the film viewers with much more respect, acknowledging that when given only the facts (without emotional manipulation and/or any particular slant) we are more than capable of coming up with our own ideas of what went on.",10,4,9,29 April 2006
