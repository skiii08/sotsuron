The Blair Witch Project," thrilling
","I wasn't actually scared during the movie, but the more I thought about it later, the more disturbed I was. I was very tense during the movie and on the edge of my seat. A must see. It is a great antidote to the usual more recent horror flicks starring cast members of 'Party of Five.'",9,1,1,3 August 1999
The Princess Bride," One of my favorites, a great fantasy
","I have seen this movie so many times I have lost count, and I never lose interest. There are countless great lines and wonderful characters. It is funny, sweet, exciting and a lot of fun. I love this movie and I usually don't enjoy theses types of movies. Everyone should rent it or just go buy it, you won't be disapointed.",Null,1,2,3 August 1999
