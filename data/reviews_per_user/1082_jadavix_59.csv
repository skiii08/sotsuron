The Lobster," A dead zone
","'The Lobster' is certainly a challenging viewing experience, and it is a challenge I wasn't equal to.Conceptually, it is like Peter Greenaway's 'The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover', and the short stories of Australian writer Peter Carey.People have described it as existing in a dystopian near future, but I don't find that approach necessary to understand the movie. Like Greenaway's movies and Carey's short stories, it's a fable: something we're not supposed to be able to place on a realistic timeline. It's just food for thought. The difference is that, in 'Her Lover', Greenaway starts with a metaphorical situation and piles on the meaning until you have no choice but to work it out for yourself. The style is such that you can't look away.'The Lobster''s style is no style. Even the performances are drained of any and all emotion. People say and do the most outrageous and bizarre things, and it's just not that interesting. I wanted to look away, and I did.It hurts to react with disinterest toward what is an intriguing central premise: a world where single people are forced to check into a hotel where they must find a partner before time runs out. Those that remain single are turned into animals. In the hotel, people are paired up for stunningly arbitrary reasons, eg. people who limp are paired together, people who are short sighted, and people who have nosebleeds. The similarities are so inconsequential that they are easily faked: one man bangs his face on the wall to make his nose bleed to hook up with a woman whose nose bleeds spontaneously. Outside the hotel, 'loners' live in the woods, espousing a polar opposite ethos: for them, any and all romance is criminal, and acts of intimacy are punished with mutilation of the lips.At this stage, I had lost interest. The movie becomes predictable in its unpredictability: you tire of seeing so many inexplicable things on screen. The true lack of style is depressing and hard to watch.This is a movie that sucks life out of you, and I didn't appreciate it for that reason.",5,2,3,3 January 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," Interesting but padded
","'10 Cloverfield Lane' is a superior example of the kind of story that would have made it into a half an hour on a show like 'The Twilight Zone' or 'The Outer Limits'. For some reason most horror/sci-fi movies these days have that feeling, like what you're seeing would have been far more effective at a shorter run time, and the idea doesn't really sustain a feature length.I guess kids today, who didn't grow up with shows like that, may not have the same impression.The story is interesting enough, and is largely held together by the unsettling performance of John Goodman. The ending is also a show stopper, though the movie has some padding on the way there that may make your interest wane.",7,6,7,13 January 2017
Hereditary," Classic of modern horror
","I was not expecting to see a movie like 'Hereditary' in this cinematic age of forced happy endings, hand-holding, and condescension.This is an unbelievably cold, troubling and disturbing movie, with content I never expected to see, no easy answers, and a black hole in the centre.It reminded me somewhat of Von Trier's film 'Antichrist', or going back further, Kubrick's 'The Shining'.Here is a movie that makes you feel totally alone, and like the ground has been ripped out from under you.It's not particularly frightening, though. It's more disturbing than anything, with near-constant upsetting material from the film's beginning. It's one of those movies where you aren't sure you want to keep watching... but you can't stop. I had to find out what was going on. And of course Toni Colette gives a typically brilliant performance.It's a horror classic. Give it a chance to win you over.",9,1,4,8 December 2018
Chinatown," Classic noir
","'Are you alone, Mr Gittes?' an anonymous caller asks Nicholson's private eye in Polanski's 'Chinatown'.His response: 'Isn't everybody?'I don't blame him for being lonely.You see, the cliché in film noir was to create a character totally at ease in the sleazy world he lives and operates in. This can be boring and exasperating when handled badly; it feels like the movie has left you by the wayside. In Chinatown, Robert Towne and Jack Nicholson broke this rule: Nicholson's Jake Gittes is not comfortable in this world. Even before being thrust into the web of deceit and corruption he seems uncomfortable. He clearly pities the cuckolded spouses he sees day to day. He's tired of lying.When Gittes begins to unravel the plot it is frequently surprising the lengths he goes to, at great personal risk, to see the bad guys punished. He is smart enough to know that no one will believe him; as Faye Dunaway's femme fatale tells him, 'he owns the police!'. Gittes is drowning in a sea of moral turpitude, looking for something good to hang onto, some sign that all is not lost.The horribly shocking ending, it has to be said, does not provide him with this, but the performances of Nicholson, Huston and Dunaway make this world much more believable to us.'Chinatown' is a film noir without film noir; it rewrites the rules, illustrating them and elevating the genre.",9,2,4,28 February 2016
A Star Is Born," Could have been so much better - too trite and clichéd
","What's surprising about this second remake of 'A Star Is Born' is not just the strength of Lady Gaga's performance, but the weakness of Bradley Cooper's.Even if you haven't seen any of the previous versions of this story, you'd be familiar with it: an aging, has-been star locates a young up and comer and gives her their start, ushering them on-stage as they exit stage left.This version makes the has-been not only aging but also drug-and-alcohol addled, which feels like an attempt to side step anything interesting about the other side of fame.You don't need to mess up on drugs and booze to stop being famous. That's what's so cruel about it. Fame is fickle. You can lose the interest of your audience through no real fault of your own. So why was it necessary to make Cooper into a druggie and alcoholic? Did the filmmakers not want to depict what show business really is?Cooper's character is a boring stiff. The movie only comes alive with Gaga. He speaks in a weird low groan which is maybe supposed to sound southern. The movie never, ever convinces you that he is a great artist. Gaga is so dynamic that you wonder why she had to be discovered by a loser like Cooper. It would have been much more believable if the reason why he was an alcoholic and addict was because he knew his music sucked and that he didn't deserve the fame. The movie expects you to take it for granted that he is a big star, but doesn't give you any reason to believe it.",6,3,4,15 December 2018
Mulan," Lesser Disney
","Lesser Disney is still better than most other things.I feel pretty confident about calling 'Mulan' lesser. For one thing, it has no memorable songs, whereas classics like 'The Lion King' and 'Aladdin' were nothing but great songs. Plus, it features Eddie Murphy in a role very similar to the one he perfected in 'Shrek' and all its sequels.As with all Disney animated flicks, it's got a strong, albeit predictable, story.I thought it was okay, but nothing special.",6,1,8,28 March 2019
Wayne's World," Likeable
","'Wayne's World' is one of those movies that I should have watched a long time ago but for some reason didn't. I finally decided to catch up with it last night.It's a movie that's hard not to like, but perhaps harder to love. The characters are so likeable, and the whole thing so earnest, it has an undeniable, goofy charm.The plot is, really, too predictable. The love interest, the slick good looking guy after the hero's girl, the soulless rich guy who tries to corrupt the hero and spoil the youngsters' good time. It's like a '50s storyboard retrofitted with slacker '90s characters.What's interesting is that the heroes are, in all probability, potheads, but there's no mention of drugs. I couldn't help but wonder if that was left out to get a PG rating.The movie's best moments are the free wheeling scenes where the characters goof off. The plot kind of gets in the way.",6,0,0,19 March 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Good, not great
","The nineties were a splendid time for Disney. They made some of their best movies in that decade: 'The Lion King', 'Aladdin', 'Toy Story', 'A Bug's Life'.And 'Beauty and the Beast'.This is one of the better ones, but I don't think it's as good as the above.The songs aren't as good as 'The Lion King''s, and the story isn't as good either.But it's still a good story, well told.",8,0,2,27 March 2019
Green Room," Punk's not dead
","'Green Room' is a strange movie. It's sort of a horror-thriller, set among the apparently still existent punk subculture. The characters speak in slang that can be hard to follow and keep up with, and at times, it seems deliberately obtuse. Some of the dialogue made very little sense to me, and I was often left struggling to understand what was going on. There's a difference between making a movie sound authentic, and making it sound like a group of cool kids having a conversation in front of you they're determined to keep you in the dark about.I rewatched the beginning to see if I had missed anything in that crucial moment where the plot really gets going, and of course, I hadn't. Therein lies the problem: the story isn't confusing or complicated. It's just told in a way that makes you think it is. The plot is about a down on their luck hardcore punk band who are siphoning fuel to power their van on a tour through north western America. They take a last minute gig in a venue that is strictly 'boots and bracers' – ie. Skinheads, where their choice of opening cover is hilarious.While there, they see something they shouldn't have, and it becomes clear to them, if not to us, that they're not going to be let out without a fight. There are some things that happen along the way – many things – that add needless confusion to a fairly straight forward story. The movie does a great job of putting you within the punk subculture, but the basic plot could have been transplanted into any milieu. There's too much incidental detail, and too much story, and these things are at war with each other.",7,1,3,23 January 2017
Public Enemies," Strangely uninvolving and forgettable
","'Public Enemies' is like one of its anti-hero's robberies. It's dazzling, occasionally stylish, violent and straight to the point. The characters zip in and out leaving mayhem in their wake, and you can barely tell them apart. You don't get to know them, and you don't know if you should feel blessed for that, or not.The movie is star studded. Perhaps the two greatest chameleons currently in movies, Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, both appear, on opposite sides of the law. There's also Billy Crudup, Marion Cotillard, Giovanni Ribisi, and a brilliantly cast Stephen Graham... who is unfortunately underused.Quite a lot happens in the movie but you don't feel invested in it. I've seen it twice now, and not one sequence sticks in my mind. Michael Mann made the risky decision to go with the gritty, hand-held camera approach to the movie, which seems incongruous with the trappings of a historical movie. The steadicam thing makes you think what you're seeing is really happening. It can't do that when everyone is dressed like the 1930's, and driving vintage cars.This isn't the first time Mann has fallen on the sword of style: remember the weird, ponderous approach to 'Ali'? This isn't as much a failure as that; it's still fairly enjoyable. It's just forgettable.",6,2,2,4 September 2019
Us," Didn't get into it
","It's hard to know what to say about a movie like 'Us'. I just didn't get into it that much. I didn't feel like it had many effective moments or memorable sequences, unlike 'Get Out'. Who could forget the scene where Daniel Kaluuya is hypnotised?The one problem I can put my finger on is I'm pretty sure the movie is too long. I think it needed to be tightened up a bit. Perhaps it would have been more shocking and frightening if the script was tighter.The only thing that stood out about the movie for me was the actress Lupita Nyong'o, who is strikingly beautiful and plays the only doppelganger that talks. Her portrayal is pretty special.",6,1,2,15 January 2020
The Irishman," Oldfellas
","The spectre of death hangs over 'The Irishman' more than any other mobster movie I know. When you think about it, that's quite a strong statement; I'd hate to know what the combined body-count of every Scorsese mafia flick is. But those movies generally dealt with money-hungry fools who didn't know what we knew; that death is coming for them.And cold-hearted sociopaths who knew how to avoid it for a little while longer.The characters in this movie know. Part of it is the casting; Joe Pesci is out of retirement here, most of us haven't seen him since 'The Good Shepherd' back in 2006, but our most vivid memories of him will always be from 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' as a psychopathic pipsqueak with a volcanic temper, or from the Lethal Weapon series and 'My Cousin Vinnie' as a quintessential conman.Here, however, those traits are gone, and though he plays a mobster, he seems like one who is tired of bloodshed, tired of rage, tired of lying.We first see our protagonist, Frank Sheeran, the titular Irishman, as an old man, clearly on his last legs, and the transition, even from middle age, that we see him make in the movie is remarkable.This sense of foreshadowing is continued with the use of titles to introduce characters as they appear on screen, followed by a subtitle, telling you how, and when, they'll die - generally by violence, ie. an exploding car, or being shot six times in the head.And yet the film is quite a bit less violent than the typical Scorsese movie. It still has a pretty steep body count, and no shortage of blood, but there's nothing really graphic like the head in the vice scene in 'Casino', or the spike through the neck in 'Goodfellas'.The film is, of course, a truly masterful and riveting jolt of cinema. And yes, it tells the story of Frank Sheeran, a small-time hitman who became personal friends with the infamous Jimmy Hoffa, and may have had involvement in his disappearance.You're on IMDB. You don't need me to tell you what it's about. So I will tell you something you might not know about 'The Irishman': it is also something none of the other Scorsese crime films were. It's moving. You really feel for this bad man. Toward the end of the movie I wondered if I might shed a tear.Think about the casting of Anna Paquin while you're watching this movie. I think it was a very deliberate, and ingenious, choice to put such a well known actress in this role. It leaves you waiting for something. You don't get it. Imagine how Frank Sheeran, her father, feels about that?Life is like that. You don't always get closure.But how can you not feel for him?'The Irishman' is one of the best movies of 2019.",9,3,7,15 December 2019
The Hateful Eight," Lesser work from a great director
","Only a Great Director (TM.) would have the gall to make a movie like this. If this were a book it would be a short story or a novella at most. As a Tarantino movie it's three hours long.The movie also attempts to be a mystery, and being this unwound is fatal to it. Mysteries need to be taut, so you pay attention. There were times during 'The Hateful Eight' where I stopped watching.I'll never know what happened to Tarantino's ability to write good dialogue. 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' were nothing but quotable lines. Where were the quotable lines in any of the movies he has made since? How many lines can you remember from them, if any at all?Tarantino made a great movie with 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood', and an absolutely appalling one with 'Death Proof'. 'The Hateful Eight' is like the bridge between the two. It may not have memorable dialogue or characters, but at least they don't prattle on about god-knows-what for an hour before getting killed, only to introduce a bunch more vacuous motor-mouths who do the same thing.It's still very well made, well acted, and feels like a lesser work from a great director.",6,1,3,28 April 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Great Spike Lee joint
","'BlacKkKlansman' is proof that Spike Lee is basically the best filmmaker making topical movies today, in this extraordinarily divided political climate.It will probably not convert anyone who isn't already on the side of the filmmakers, but it is never less than interesting.It tells the true story of two police officers, one black, one Jewish, who infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. David Duke, the still extant former klan leader, is portrayed in the film by a restrained and creepy Topher Grace.The film has a couple of genuinely heartening moments that put a smile on my face, and a stirring montage of actual film clips of recent years to conclude the film, and frame the true story in today's world.Spike Lee does not just make topical, controversial films, a la Oliver Stone. He is an auteur with a lively and unique style of his own. His films are, as near as I can tell always of interest. He has what Pauline Kael called 'film sense', knowing what works and what doesn't.Even among his superlative record, 'BlacKkKlansman' is highly recommended.",8,6,11,10 December 2018
Black Mass," This was okay
","Kind of a mob movie by rote. Every killing is telegraphed and the performances are better than they really should be for such tired material. Take away the contact lenses (or was it CGI?) and I wonder how intense and scary Mr Depp really would've been, though. There is very little involvement from the women in this one, which may be a blessing in disguise since they do the typical thing women do in mob movies - actually, make that almost all movies - and just stand around looking worried and begging their husbands to stop doing the Wrong Thing. Hate to see a little variety from female characters in these things, eh? Would it be too much to ask for some actual characters?",6,1,1,16 October 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A chance to cut is a chance to cure
","Mildred puts the three billboards up on a disused road in Ebbing to hit at the man she thinks, incorrectly, is responsible for her daughter's rapist and murderer never having been caught. She is a hardened and occasionally violent woman with huge eyes that reveal the depths of her suffering, even if the rest of her only seems invested in causing the suffering of other people.'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is basically about hurt. It's about trying to deal with the hurt by hurting others. It's about taking the hurt upon yourself, to try to stop it before it grows, as it inevitably will. It also shows that when we take our hurt out on big targets, we end up hurting other people, who may or may not deserve it.The dialogue is, as always, great from the playwright Martin McDonagh, who remains one of few filmmakers whose every film should be cause for celebration. It's not a surprise that he has great actors like McDormand wanting to work for him; this could well be another Oscar nomination from her.Everybody in this movie is hurt one way or another and they all try to deal with it, mostly by spreading it around. The problem is that some hurts are so big we don't know who or where to aim ourselves. But somebody has to pay.Right?",8,1,2,19 February 2018
The Revenant," Two amazing moments in a very good movie
","'The Revenant' opens with two absolutely jaw dropping scenes, the second arguably topping the first. They alone are worth the price of admission.The first is an extraordinary battle scene that feels like it was filmed in one take. The camera puts you there, on the spot, in the midst of the carnage. It makes you feel as though what it is allowing you to see is really going on all around you, not around it.The second scene is impossible to speak of without using hyperbole. It is unlike anything I have seen before. Yes, I am talking about the bear attack scene, easily the greatest film moment of 2015, and one of the greatest scenes of any film made in the new millennium so far. This will surely top the list of 'how the HELL did they do THAT?' moments in movie history.The rest of the movie is solid, but not quite up to that standard, but that standard is so high, this shouldn't be taken as a negative.The performances by DiCaprio, Hardy and Gleason and also top notch, and ensure that the movie is never just about its set-pieces.",9,2,3,16 July 2016
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Better than I expected
","'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' was perhaps better than I'd expected. I'm not that into superheroes; never really was. So I didn't have high hopes. However, the movie surprised me straight off the bat for a couple of reasons. For one thing, the animation is not what I'd expected. It's more Pixar than Marvel. But more significantly, the protagonist of the movie is not Peter Parker, who I regard as a boring character. The protagonist is a half-African American, half-Puerto Rican teenager who is bitten by the radioactive spider in the subway.The plot is fairly interesting, allowing for multiple Spider-men and women, but I didn't get into it that much. Quite often I wasn't paying complete attention. I didn't think the animation style totally fit. But the fact that I watched the whole movie is probably a sign that it's very good, since as I just explained, it's not really my kind of thing, but I watched it regardless.",7,0,0,7 October 2019
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," This was much better than I expected
","Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation was much better than I expected. Just when I thought action movies had completely lost the plot I saw this and was entertained throughout. It features some amazing scenes and set pieces, and the action doesn't let up until well into the second half, which I felt wasn't entirely up to the standard set by what preceded it.Regardless, the movie held my attention throughout its entire run-time. I could actually understand what was going on, which is a rarity in action movies in this day and age. It's like directors know people don't care about plot or characters anymore; they just want stunts and special effects, so why bother explaining them with plot? MI:RN doesn't make this mistake.I thought Simon Pegg was the standout. The movie needs a human centre in its world of shadowy double agents with impeccable dress sense. He provides it. Sean Harris is, also, a fantastic bad guy.Recommended.",8,3,7,21 October 2015
The Exorcist," Still shocking, all these years later
","This one has lost none of its power to shock or terrify.You've heard of the head spinning round, the green vomit, probably even the crucifix masturbation scene.That doesn't prepare you.It's not the material itself that makes it so shocking, although, over forty years later, even the language retains an edge. I've still never heard that variation of the c-word in any other movie, I don't think. It's the direction, which always takes you by surprise, which lulls you into a state of security it punctures again and again until finally letting the horror take over like a bad dream you can't wake up from.It's the screenplay, too. This is a movie about people. About people suffering an unspeakable trauma. About people driven to the edge where the supernatural meets them.It's not about special effects or shocking violence.The characters live and breathe, you feel what they feel, even the disbelief.The Exorcist carries you along. It takes you to places you don't want to go, working its magic in ways you can never fully understand.And it remains shocking and terrifying.",10,5,5,26 February 2016
Saw III," Lame gore, confusing story, forgettable traps
","'Saw III' is boring and forgettable garbage. Even its gore scenes are nothing to write home about. None of the traps are memorable. The only thing about the movie I expect I'll remember is the stupid, irritating voice of the bad guy.Of course, they had to show us the real face of the man behind Jigsaw. With his stupid voice, I'm surprised the police ever had a hard time finding the guy. Hell, he even looks like a killer. How stupid are the people who make these movies? How much scarier would it have been if they had chosen the last person you would ever expect to be behind such a thing, like a young man who works in a supermarket, or an elderly woman. No, instead they choose some character actor who has spent his life perfecting the look and facial expression of a killer from the imagination of an idiot.The movie sort of has a main character in some guy who's angry because his kid died, and Jigsaw gives him the opportunity to take revenge. The movie doesn't tell his story strongly enough, and there's too much other garbage muddling it all up. At least the first movie in the series didn't have that problem. So what were they thinking this time around?But who cares, right? The movie is about elaborate gruesome traps, and gore. It's just too bad they all suck this time around.",3,1,1,15 June 2019
Climax," They should have spiked it sooner
","Gaspar Noé's 'Climax' is a rarity in that it is a movie that does exactly what it says it will, and really nothing more, nothing less. If you are reading this you probably already know what it's about, even if you haven't seen it yet: a group of French dancers meet in a remote location to rehearse, and realise too late that the 'sangria' they have all been drinking is spiked with LSD.Their behaviour gets increasingly crazy, in some cases attacking each other and themselves. In one instance a woman is accidentally set on fire, though typically Noé's camera doesn't follow her.Eventually they all just end up gibbering wrecks on the floor.If the movie has any serious problem, however, it's how long it takes to get going. More than half the movie is spent with these characters just talking, and their conversations are dull. It's not until over half way in that the drugs start to take hold. Before that, these characters aren't interesting enough. I don't know if you're supposed to care about them or not, but I certainly didn't.",7,1,2,11 March 2019
Man on the Moon," A great study of a confounding character
","I wasn't able to get my head around Andy Kaufman and who he was supposed to be, and after watching 'Man on the Moon', I'm still not. I believe that's the point. Kaufman wasn't a comedian or even an actor as much as he was a practical joker. It wasn't enough for him to become another person: he wanted people to believe that person was completely separate from him, insisting on separate acting credits for his creations, and going as far as getting other actors to play the role right when everyone thought they had it pegged as Kaufman in a suit.He was such a consummate joker that rumours persist he faked his own death. The movie leaves this ambiguous, as everything you have seen leading up to it makes you wonder if conspiracy theorists might be right for a change.Carrey's performance is a thing of beauty. He doesn't look much like Kaufman did, but that doesn't matter. You forget it's him you're watching early on and he becomes the character, or characters. You don't know if the character is Kaufman, or Kaufman playing someone else, or someone else playing Kaufman, which is about right. I believe that's the point.",8,1,1,15 August 2016
The Princess Bride," You know it's a classic - but that doesn't mean it's perfect
","There's not much to say about 'The Princess Bride' that hasn't already been said. It's one of the most beloved cult classics ever made for a reason. The characters are memorable, lines of dialogue stay with you, and it is even laugh-out-loud funny at times. The framing story of Colombo reading to Kevin Arnold makes the experience more than just a classic fairy tale, but a tribute to fairy tales and the imagination itself.It's not perfect, though. The ending is kind of disappointing, a bit anticlimactic, if you ask me, and the movie seems to run out of steam toward the end in general. I wonder if the producers knew that going in, as Billy Crystal is such a welcome face - even if his face is covered with make-up and rubber prosthetics.",7,0,0,24 March 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Brilliant
","I had given up on Tarantino. 'Kill Bill: Part 2' showed the extinction of his ability to write witty dialogue. 'Death Proof' showed the maggots feasting on the corpse of this ability. I didn't watch 'Inglourious Basterds', but 'Django' was pretty overrated. I gave up on 'The Hateful Eight', not wanting to watch three hours of Jennifer Jason Leigh being physically assaulted. I was tired of his endless homages and imitations of other movies, which had the effect of making me wish I'd watched those movies instead.Well, 'Once Upon a Time...' is a work of maturity from the director. It has been said that directors become great not by adding, but by taking away, and that's what Tarantino has done here. None of the typical Tarantino-isms distract or irritate. He is not the same man he was all those years ago. His talent has developed. This is a work worthy of Scorsese, or any other great filmmaker.Yes, the film is about fictional characters - both brilliantly written and portrayed - on the fringes of Hollywood around the time of the Sharon Tate murder. It feels like historical fiction, before finally segueing into alternative history.The title is fitting. What starts as a lovingly detailed picture finally becomes more like a fairy tale. It begins with what was, and becomes what should have been. The characters are all grasping at something, from greater fame to a better seat at the table.Which is, of course, Hollywood in a nutshell.Thus 'Once Upon a Time...' is one of the most complete pictures of Hollywood ever captured on celluloid. It begins with staggering attention to detail, and evolves into a fairy tale. It captures the time and place, but more than that, the heart and soul of a city and an era.It is brilliant.",9,1,6,22 December 2019
Django Unchained," Better than 'Death Proof'
","I pretty much gave up on Tarantino after 'Death Proof'. He had been my favourite filmmaker in the '90s, but as far as I'm concerned, with that movie, he totally lost the plot. The signs were there: with 'Kill Bill, vol. 2' I kept wondering what happened to his ability to write witty and original dialogue.The dialogue was what was so great about his first movies. Back in the early '90s, movies used dialogue to advance the story. That was pretty much it. Watch an early '90s blockbuster like 'Basic Instinct' for an example. Every time the characters talk it is only to communicate information that the screenwriters want the audience to know to help the movie get to its final destination. Tarantino's characters don't just talk because the movie needs them to. They talk because they have personalities of their own; there were no 'Mr Expositions' in 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs'.In 'Death Proof', however, Tarantino totally fell on his own sword. That was the one where characters talked. And talked. And talked. And talked. And died in a car crash. And were introduced. And talked. And talked.The first time I watched 'Django Unchained', I didn't get very far. There was too much Christopher Waltz, and of course, too much uninteresting dialogue. But I decided to give it another go just now.What I can say about the movie is that it is nowhere near as bad as 'Death Proof'. The dialogue isn't endless and tedious to that extreme. It's also not that interesting, though. The movie often lost my attention; it was hard to care too much for the plot. It was enlivened by its set pieces and hand picked character stars.It did not need to be almost three hours. I think most of the dialogue between Waltz and Foxx could have been cut out, and the details discussed shown, rather than told.What the hell did Waltz win the Oscar for? If any performance in the movie was Oscar-worthy, it was DiCaprio's. Waltz was a plot device, and pretty one-note.",6,1,2,26 September 2019
Get Out," A great beginning and middle, and an anti-climactic ending
","'Get Out' starts strongly, with several chilling moments, but doesn't quite come together in the end.For most of its run-time, it is a rebuttal to anyone who thinks that the horror genre cannot be socially relevant. From its opening scenes reminding us of Trayvon Martin, to the protagonist meeting affluent types at a party, none of whom can avoid mentioning his ethnicity, aspects of 'Get Out' feel almost too timely and on-point, perhaps uncomfortably so, which is, of course, a great place to set a horror movie.The movie shows its hand pretty early, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that it has you primed for a big reveal, and I found myself a bit let down by the climax and its conclusion. The beginning was handled so skilfully, I was obviously hoping it would continue in kind. However, it went too far into standard horror territory in the end, and seemed to lose touch with the social conscience that had made its first act so interesting.",7,1,3,7 October 2017
Room," A must see
","It's hard to know what to write about a movie like 'Room'. On one hand, it is certainly one of the must-see movies of 2015, but on the other, you've surely heard the buzz by now, and don't need an IMDb reviewer to tell you. Further, it's a movie you ought to know as little about as possible before watching.I will say that Jacob Tremblay, the actor who played five year old Jack, deserved an Oscar nod. Being that they are always in such close proximity, you can't help but compare the work of Brie Larson with Tremblay. He should have gotten a nomination at least. I feel that there are many other actresses who could have done what Larson did, but not many more who could have played Jack.",9,2,4,16 July 2016
Call Me by Your Name," An exercise in cynicism?
","'Call Me by Your Name' is one of the more tedious gay-themed films I have seen. It is impossible to care about its main character, because you never really get to know him. The movie is drastically overlong, at over two hours, and feels like twice that length. You'd think you'd get some kind of insight into the protagonist after spending all that time with him. You'd be wrong.I wonder if 'Call Me by Your Name' is actually just an exercise in cynicism. Hear me out: It's about a young gay man who is attracted to the boring hunk who comes to stay. They end up having sex, but the young man also has sex with a girl. Aside from that, the protagonist doesn't do or say much. He just lies around reading books and smoking.Here's where the cynicism comes in. Could it be that the filmmakers believe that if their character is gay, he doesn't HAVE to say or do anything interesting - people will go see the movie and defend it regardless, because he's gay?Just a thought.Armie Hammer has to be one of the dullest actors around. He makes absolutely no impression. I have seen him in movies before, but didn't recognize him in this, because he is so boring you forget about him from movie to movie, or even scene to scene. Just as there is no attempt to make the protagonist interesting, there's also no attempt to make this object of his lust interesting either.People are probably going to be too scared to say they didn't like a movie such as 'Call Me by Your Name', for fear of being branded homophobes. I am not: characters have to do more to keep my interest than just being gay, black, female, whatever. 'Call Me by Your Name' is a snoozefest.",5,11,38,9 March 2018
Sing Street," Starts promisingly, ends in cliché
","'Sing Street' is this year's entry in the UK/Ireland coming-of-age movie genre. These movies are generally a treat. You get some reality from these movies that you don't generally get from coming- of-age films from the US. When a movie hits some real notes you watch closely, thinking that it might be about to break free from the reins of cliché and show you something different. You generally also get poignancy in the bargain: truth hits home.'Sing Street' starts like that, and it starts well. Connor is a fifteen year old high school kid who has to change schools due to financial difficulty his constantly warring parents are experiencing. The school is a nightmare, filled with bullies, delinquents, and teachers as violent as both.Connor has a plan, though: he wants to start a band. He does this with an ease that feels a bit contrived. In fact, everything that happens with the band seems too easy: all the members can play adequately from the get go, despite only being in their middle teens, and they come together much quicker than seems likely. When Connor sings, the voice doesn't sound like it comes from his body, or even from the environment the character is in. It sounds like it comes from a recording studio, and a man much older with more training, and maybe even some studio effects to balance it out.If Connor can sing this well, why is he looking to start a band with a bunch of school friends? Shouldn't he be on 'Top of the Pops'?'Sing Street' is a movie that starts like a breath of fresh air, a movie that could end up containing truth. Alas, it doesn't; it heads into cliché territory and never really looks back.The movie features a dream sequence in which everyone sings and dances and priests do cartwheels. While watching this, I wasn't sure if what I was watching was supposed to be fantasy or just more of the same. That's the problem with the whole movie.",5,1,4,2 February 2017
The Football Factory," Watchable enough, with distracting dream sequences and an overload of noisy presentation
","'The Football Factory' is a passable, entertaining movie about football thugs. It does not absurdly glamourise this moronic pass-time like 'Green Street Hooligans', which expected us to be taken in by the culture of violence as its miscast hero was. It does, however, wallow in the muck a bit much, and it doesn't provide much of a reason for its hero's involvement in this horrible business.Furthermore, the punchy style, with its quick, in your face editing, blaring soundtrack of recognizable bands, pugnacious voice-over, title cards, blink and you miss them flashback sequences, all combine to keep you at a distance from the protagonist. This is the style you expect from a British movie about the working classes, but by 2004 it was looking a little tired. It jazzes up the material, and is that really necessary? Do the creators love the violent lifestyle, or condemn it? They clearly do not wish to merely depict it, there's too much staging for that.Danny Dyer is also miscast. He is introduced at the beginning of the movie as a typical young hoodlum. He doesn't look, or even really act, like one. There is some nonsense about him having recurring dreams that don't really add anything to the movie, or the character. After all the noise, swearing, violence and mayhem, they don't make enough of an impact to really justify their presence.The movie is still watchable, it's just really not anything great.",6,1,1,19 May 2016
Here Comes the Boom," Okay
","'Here Comes the Boom' isn't as bad as it might have been, and it's too good-natured, and not aggressively stupid enough to hate.I expected to probably be appalled by its lame jokes and turn it off mid way, but I didn't. It actually has a couple of laughs. The real stand-out is Bas Rutten, the legendary mixed martial artist, who here plays the main character's trainer and is the funniest thing in the movie. He's definitely funnier than Kevin James, making you wonder why that guy really has a career.I didn't really believe the set-up. James wants to raise money to stop his school's music program from shutting down, despite not being a music teacher. Henry Winkler is the school's music teacher. James says he's his hero, which doesn't really ring true.The fights were a bit more realistic and bloody than I was expecting. It was disappointing we didn't see more of Bas Rutten's instruction.This was a pretty average comedy. Not as bad as I expected, but not much better either. Pretty forgettable.",6,0,1,21 August 2019
Jurassic World," Trite and stupid, but with a few good moments
","Everything about this movie is hackneyed and tired, from the characters, to the music, to the CGI. The premise of 'super dinosaurs' is just fundamentally stupid and insulting. I guess the makers envisioned the inner monologue of the average movie fan like so:'Derrrr, another Jurassic Park movie. I've seen dinosaurs before. Who cares? ...-Wait. It says here they're SUPER dinosaurs. Like, genetically enhanced ones. THAT'S something I haven't seen before. Where do I sign up?'The dinosaurs being SUPER dinosaurs isn't even relevant to the plot and makes no real difference to the movie. The whole concept of the original movie, which made it a winner, was the pitting of humans against creatures who once walked the Earth. Who will win? The fact that the makers went out of their way to create the most realistic specimens ever seen made the experience all the more special.In this case we have an 'indomitus rex' or some such rubbish, just like the original t-rex but, er, SUPER. The fact that whatever about it is SUPER is not even really shown or explored in the movie suggests that part of the plot was just to sell tickets and convince people they were seeing something different.The depiction of the raptors is also all wrong. Over twenty years later and they're not anywhere near as scary as they were in the original movie. Maybe it's the crap CGI or the way they're depicted as quasi- soldiers, I don't know. Lastly, the music. I am really tired of the orchestral scores movies like this use to heighten the action/suspense. It. All. Sounds. The. Same. I noticed it all the way through Fury Road as well. I think composers hit a wall with that stuff twenty years ago and now they're just reheating the same old stuff. Do filmmakers even need to pay a composer to come up with a score these days? Why not just use another movie's? It's all exactly the same anyway.All that said, this movie does have a few moments where I felt the tension, and unlike Fury Road, at least I could understand what was going on from one scene to the next, though the moment when the dinosaurs get the upper hand on the park-goers is kind of rushed. It seems way too easy.",6,2,7,21 October 2015
Midsommar," What a long strange trip
","For much of 'Midsommar', I thought what I was seeing was good, but perhaps baggy and overlong.I was wrong.This is a movie that needs its mannered pacing and length. It's a true slow burn that rewards that rarest of quality these days: patience.I am so glad I stuck it out. Ari Aster, I never should have doubted you. 'Hereditary' was brilliant, and 'Midsommar' arguably tops it.'Hereditary' reminded me of 'The Shining', and even more so, 'Midsommar' presents Kubrickian attention to detail, and perfection in the framing of each shot, and the way facial expressions subtly tell their own story.I was completely won over by this movie in the end. I felt like I had ingested the same drug the people in the movie had taken. The movie's slow burn approach and subtle hallucinogenic effects gradually take over, like an approaching acid trip. But even that might not blow your mind like this did.Another masterpiece from Ari Aster.",9,0,3,5 November 2019
Singin' in the Rain," A musical for those who don't like musicals
","I'm not a musical fan, and I've seen quite a few, but I have to say that 'Singin' in the Rain' is the best musical I've seen. It's a musical for people who don't like musicals. Aside from the fact that the numbers featured are immortal, the dancing is a lot more athletic and frankly amazing, for those of us who don't really 'get' Fred Astaire.What grabbed me about 'Singin' in the Rain' is that it's about a serious issue, the move from silent films to talkies, and actually features some real-world detail, like a star losing her career when she opens her mouth to speak, and a relationship manufactured by a studio.The movie lost my attention at times, but it works. Watching it back-to-back with 'Wizard of Oz', I never felt the same apprehension when each musical number started. The dancing helped - though I was more impressed by O'Connor than Kelly.",8,1,1,10 February 2019
Where Eagles Dare," Better than 'Navarone', but still not great
","I watched 'Where Eagles Dare' back-to-back with 'Guns of Navarone'. This less famous men-on-a-mission war flick is a better movie. It benefits greatly from Burton's magnetic presence as the main character, and a clear premise. It also has a memorable sequence in which the men ride on the top of a cable car.Unfortunately, as is often the case with these war flicks, it's terminally overlong, and becomes confusing at about the midway point. The second half largely squanders the goodwill the first half generated.",7,1,4,1 December 2018
Sicario," Long-winded and boring
","'Sicario' is an oddly distancing and expansive movie that seems more about deserts, rural Mexico and military encampments than it is about the things that happen in those environments. Everything seems stepped back deliberately so you lose interest in the story and just notice the shots.The plot is something about a naive FBI SWAT operative (do they even make those?) who gets involved with the CIA, the Department of Defence, the military, the Delta Force, and so many other military bodies you get confused. But then I guess it's supposed to be confusing.The point of the thing is that the main character doesn't understand what's going on either, she's being used, etc. It's just not involving enough to be interesting. It's the kind of movie where reading a synopsis makes it sound so much more interesting than watching the movie actually is. In words, you can leave out the boring bits and focus on the bits that matter.This is what Villeneuve's direction should have done.",5,2,4,8 July 2016
Pretty Woman," Small classic rom-com
","'Pretty Woman' has what seems like such a cookie cutter Hollywood plot that it is a surprise to see that it works and is a small classic of its type.Romantic comedies are, perhaps, necessarily formulaic. People don't want to be challenged when they watch one of those. If 'Pretty Woman' has any challenges they are in Julia Roberts' performance, which is really what makes the movie work.Richard Gere, on the other hand, is kind of a dull actor, and I thought the movie was a bit overlong.",7,0,1,27 March 2019
The Shape of Water," A beautiful story
","'The Shape of Water' is a beautiful movie which is slightly let down by clumsy pacing. It has breathtaking sequences of tenderness, staging and set design, and also moments of shocking violence. It achieves something I never thought I would see in a movie: sexual contact between a woman and a monster which is not just completely repulsive.The bad guy, I thought, was also a little unnecessary, much like the antagonist in 'Pan's Labyrinth', also by del Toro. I didn't think we needed such a cardboard cut-out bad guy, who distracted me from what I thought the movie was really about.",7,9,17,11 February 2018
The Witch," Disappointing and hard to get through
","'The Witch' is a movie that starts with promise but ends up a chore to sit through. With each development of the plot it doesn't feel like you are in the hands of somebody who knows what they're doing, who's leading you from one twist or surprise to another. In fact, nothing in the movie is really surprising, or shocking, and it's not in the least scary.The filmmaker went to a lot of trouble to get the actors speaking and sounding right, and looking right. But aside from that, it's a frustrating experience, because nothing really comes of anything. You expect something but don't really get anything.There is one scene I didn't like, that made me feel for the actor involved. A young boy is made to appear naked in front of an older girl. If you are into that kind of thing, don't get excited: you can't really see anything, but you can tell he is undressed. Don't you wonder about how they filmed such a thing? How did the boy feel about being made to do that?",6,2,3,14 July 2016
Joker," Please don't let there be a sequel.
","What a brilliant left-of-field movie this is. In this boring staid cinema environment of franchises, sequels, prequels, remakes, reboots, who saw this coming? Ask yourself these questions: Who ever thought perhaps the most iconic villain in comic book history could have a moving origin story? Who thought that the world of DC comics could create a moving, and even realistic, portrayal of mental illness? Who would have thought that the guy responsible for obnoxious comedies like 'Road Trip', 'Old School' and all those Hangover movies was capable of making a movie that pays homage to classics 'Taxi Driver' and 'King of Comedy' - without disgracing either film?You already know what the movie is about. It's not really complicated. It's not really even plot-oriented. Yes, this is the downward spiral of one Arthur Fleck, failed comedian, who comes to call himself Joker, and in his insanity inspires a revolution that could easily lead to him being crowned the Clown Prince of Crime. It's a gripping, moving character study, with a performance from Phoenix that may be the year's best.The hardest thing about mental illness, Fleck writes, in his Travis Bickle-esque journal, is that you have to pretend you don't have it. When he wrote that, he didn't realise what this movie teaches you: that normies might expect you to pretend, but there's a wide world of Joker types out there, people who never had a chance. When mainstream society spurns you, for better or worse, you are not alone.Robert de Niro, as the co-star, proves that 2019 is the year he was ready to stop messing around with garbage like 'Dirty Grandpa' and take this acting thing seriously again. People were starting to doubt if he still cared. Those doubts end now.But yes, the real star of the show is Joaquin Phoenix. I began this review with some questions, but I left out perhaps the most obvious one:Who ever thought that the character of the Joker could be enriched with another portrayal that's good enough to rival the one Heath Ledger gave us in 'The Dark Knight'?",9,3,8,18 December 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," A voice from the past
","'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a strange experience viewed with the wisdom of hindsight. It's like two movies grafted together, luckily both being pretty good, but making an uneasy hybrid.It works best as a coming of age tale, told from the perspective of Scout. I wish the whole movie could just have been that. When the perspective shifts to Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck, who won an Oscar for the role, it gets a bit creaky. I think coming-of-age stories are timeless. Treatment of racism, however? That gets old and embarrassing quickly.It is a testament to the movie's power that it's treatment of the racially motivated false accusation of rape at the movie's centre is not as bad as it might be, but it is still pretty cringe inducing in the way it resolves to make Finch into a noble white hero at the expense of black extras playing characters who should have gotten speaking roles.The resolution attempts to tie together the coming-of-age story and the legal drama, and is a brilliant resolution for the first, but barely seems to touch the second.It might have worked in '62, and I think the real reason why people still worship this movie is because it reminds us of a time when these queasy issues could be dismissed without too much thought. It's not adored for its agelessness - on the contrary. It's a time capsule. A reminder of a simpler time.",7,1,2,14 February 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," Overdone and pointless
","'Hail, Caesar!' is basically a series of over-produced sketches lampooning Hollywood genre films of yesteryear.Josh Brolin plays a character who is supposed to tie it all together, but he doesn't. His character, along with his relevance to the story, is pushed aside by musical and epic film scenes. These all feature a tongue in cheek and a wink at the audience, but you may feel that wink is probably aimed at someone else... who might also feel the same way.Simply put, the satire is toothless, because it doesn't have a relevant target in this day and age. How many film goers in the 2010s can even remember watching '50s musicals and historical epics?",5,2,3,26 January 2017
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Great then, inadequate now
","Disney's 'Snow White' deserves its due as the first full length, sound and colour animated movie. I had a fear the animation may not hold up, but it still looks great.The movie itself feels a little empty, though. It feels like there isn't enough story to make a full length movie: it seems to take a long time for anything to happen. The titular dwarfs don't make an appearance until much later than I had expected. Their uniquely descriptive names call attention to the only character traits any of the characters have. Snow White is hardly a character. Like the dwarfs, her name is a description; unlike them it is a descriptor of her appearance, not her personality. 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' must have looked like magic up on the big screen in 1937 for adult and child alike, but nowadays there's just not enough going on on screen to hold our attention. The musical numbers, aside from the dwarfs' chant that everyone knows, are forgettable, it doesn't have any memorable characters, and the ending is underwhelming.For classic Disney, I recommend 'Pinocchio' for a better story and characters, and 'Bambi' for atmosphere.",5,1,12,27 November 2016
Parasite," Poor pacing, too few twists, too unbelievable
","I think there's a really good movie buried in 'Parasite' somewhere, but I gave up trying to find it. It has the same problem the director's previous 'The Host' had: the pacing is broken.That's not all, though. People have written about the movie's unexpected twists and turns. The thing is, it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive, they are too few and far between, and too unbelievable. The first major twist happens about an hour in, and seems to come out of nowhere.The parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich Parks are the best bits, though they are far fetched: how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand?But then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly, until by the end I wasn't even paying attention.Pity. Some of the sequences were brilliant.",6,33,56,20 December 2019
Halloween," The best slasher ever?
","For my money, 'Halloween' is the best slasher ever. I've seen hundreds of them - the sub-genre went into overdrive in the decade after - and this is the best.It's funny how with horror, less is often more. The original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', itself a classic, had a budget similar in size to this, and it too was far more effective than any of the rubbish that followed it. It's as though money creates distance, which is anathema for horror. You have to feel like you're in there with the characters, and Halloween pulls that off perhaps better than any other horror movie I've seen.It's also genuinely frightening.Something else this movie gets right is that the heroine is believable and relatable. It's not the usual gaggle of obnoxious late-twenties 'teenagers' whom you can't wait to see offed. Jamie Lee Curtis just had that charismatic quality, and her character is resourceful in a way that doesn't seem forced.If the movie has a flaw, it's that the soundtrack (though iconic) can be overwhelming at times, and not necessarily in a good way.This is still basically the blueprint for filmmakers to follow when they make a slasher, but somehow, they rarely, if ever, get it right.",9,0,0,7 April 2019
Marriage Story," Why does anybody get married?
","Hopefully 'Marriage Story' will net Scarlett Johnansson an Academy Award. How many actors go from adorable child stars to capable adult performers to among the greatest performers working?I had my reservations about 'Marriage Story', though. I like Noah Baumbach. His movies are like antidotes to the wafer thin perfect protagonists you get in every other movie. However sometimes that can be a bit much. There is a layer of humour and irony that counterbalances the generally unlikable nature of the characters. But it seems a delicate balancing act. Is 'Marriage Story' the movie where Baumbach finally falls to the net, and provides us a cringe-inducing story of unlikable characters doing hateful things?The answer is, as you've no doubt guessed, no. It is true that the characters do not endear you to them immediately. Cameos from Ray Liotta and Alan Alda (well into his eighties) come as stark relief from their selfish behaviour. But if anyone can turn this into a strength, Baumbach can. It's artful the way he makes us come around to his characters, letting us feel the push and pull of a divorce settlement, siding with one, then the other, and finally, endearing us to both of them, people who grew apart as they grew on you.'Marriage Story' is one of the year's best films, with a career best performance in front of the camera from Johansson and Driver, and a career best performance from Baumbach behind it.",9,6,8,30 January 2020
Mary and Max," A classic
","There's not much to say about 'Mary and Max' that won't have been said before, so I'll just start by saying this: it was a lot better than I expected. The filmmaker is known for his award winning 'Harvie Krumpet', but that was a short film, and I wasn't sure if his style of animation would work over feature film length.I was wrong to doubt him. The movie grabbed me early on and scarcely let go. It is a beautiful story.There's not much more to say than that.",9,0,1,20 October 2019
Rear Window," Another Hitchcock masterpiece
","It's a sad fact that when one watches a lot of old classic movies they come away slightly dissatisfied, either because aspects of the film haven't aged well, or because the movie has since been copied so many times that you can recite the plot in your sleep.Hitchcock is one of few filmmakers from the Golden Age of Hollywood to whom this does not apply. His films simply do not seem to age. Sure, if you want to be picky you can probably find little things that no longer seem realistic, but the thing is that his movies are so overwhelmingly involving that you don't tend to notice or want to engage in such nitpicking.'Rear Window' is one of his masterpieces, and he made a few. It is extraordinary to me how many movies attempt to be suspenseful, and aren't. Hitchcock was called 'The Master' for a reason. He was a master: of stage direction, sets, dialogue, subtle use of close-up, and, perhaps above all, of suspense.You probably already know what 'Rear Window' is about, even if you haven't seen it. The Hollywood legend Jimmy Stewart, certainly one of the greatest actors the silver screen ever held, stars as a photojournalist who is laid out with a broken leg and spies on his neighbours across from him to pass the time. He comes to believe that one of his neighbours has murdered his wife, and at first his naive girlfriend and nurse don't believe him, but then they come around and become involved in the theory as well, to their own peril.It is, simply put, a masterpiece. In this day and age, the device of a movie that never leaves a room would be an advertising gimmick to draw in customers. Here, you don't even notice it - it's a surprise to realise you never left Stewart's side. And it's climax is more than just suspenseful - it's almost unbearable.If you are a film lover, you owe it to yourself to watch 'Rear Window'.",10,3,4,17 February 2019
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Hard not to like
","The secret to the success of 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure', as with 'Wayne's World', is that it's just so hard not to like it. The whole thing has such a disarming, goofy charm, that to say you didn't enjoy it would make you feel like an a-hole.And come on, how do you not like a movie about a couple of teenage idiots who travel through time in a phone booth picking up historical figures? And where Napoleon Bonaparte gets an award for eating an enormous icecream sundae? And where one of the said teenage idiots sword fights with Joan of Arc - who he previously belived to be 'Noah's wife'?The scenes where the characters encounter the historical figures aren't as successful. They're believable enough, but not that entertaining.",7,0,1,19 March 2019
Deadpool," Lame, unfunny waste of time
","'Deadpool' is a tiresomely unfunny stab at making both a superhero movie that can compete with the best of that genre and a parody of superhero movies that can also satirise them. It succeeds at neither. For a huge budget superhero flick, the plot and scenarios are just way too uninspired and boring. It has a pretty good opening action scene, but after that it has absolutely nothing you won't have seen before in any other recent comic book movie. As a parody, it just isn't funny, and all the nudge nudge wink wink moments get old in the first scene, and then continue all the way up to the inevitable after-credits-scene, which is just as unfunny as everything we've seen before it.It's the Seth MacFarlane school of anti-comedy. Didn't laugh the first time? Well, you're out of luck, because that joke will be repeated obnoxiously throughout the rest of the run time.The movie also seems to think that name dropping everything pop-culture related is funny by default. You leave, probably unable to remember an actual gag, but maybe some of the relentless name dropping is still with you, because you've just heard it a million times. Reynolds, as Deadpool, even name-drops himself at one point, and not even that got a laugh.",3,14,32,24 July 2016
Green Book," ClichÃ© almost overcome by professionalism
","'Green Book' is a sure fire crowd pleaser, but you probably knew that already.We've all seen this before: two people from totally different worlds meet, clash at first, learn to like each other, and realise they're not that different after all. That's the lesson for us cretins in the audience: it doesn't matter what colour we are or where we're from or blah blah de blah blah. It's a lesson that used to be exclusively sold to preteen kids, but in the world of the new millennium, this stuff is considered acceptable to preach to adults and nobody gets offended at the condescension.But how bad is it, really? Not bad at all, of course. It's the performances: two of the finest actors in the movies up there on screen, and most of the action in the dialogue. There were times when I forgot how trite it was, but the movie had a way of reminding me.",7,6,12,16 January 2019
The Great Escape," Good but overlong
","'The Great Escape' is one of those classics that I can never remember a time when I didn't know about, or couldn't hum its indelible, cheerful score. For some reason I never watched it, perhaps due to reservations about watching older movies of this length.I was right on one count: the movie is, alas, quite a bit overlong. And surprising. You don't go into a movie as famous and as old as this one expecting surprises.The surprises come at the ending. It's not just the title that made me expect the movie would focus entirely on the escape. It's also the fact that those scenes are so engaging - if perhaps a little padded. Of particular note are the parts with Charles Bronson - dodgy Polish accent notwithstanding - and Donald Pleasence both working to escape.But when the action moves outside of the prison, the movie seriously outstays its welcome, and I was not expecting the downbeat ending - even if it does use that cheerful, unforgettable, hummable score.",7,1,2,25 November 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," Underwhelming
","I think the first John Wick movie struck a chord with audiences because it was a back-to-basics action movie without a superhero anywhere to be found. The superhero/comic book genre seems to have subsumed action films. If you want to see stuff blown up real good, that's where you go: not to Schwarzenegger or Stallone or Van Damme or Lundgren or Snipes. Standard action flicks don't have the budget to impress you with special effects any more; in fact, they mostly go straight to the shelf these days, bypassing the cinema.What's funny is that 'John Wick: Chapter 2' is barely any different to those movies that are comic books brought to life. Watching it, I often felt like I was looking at 'A Scanner Darkly' from all those years ago, so stylized are the movie's visuals and of course, here's Keanu Reeves again, nobody's idea of a realistic actor.He's also basically a superhero. At one point in this movie, he takes a bullet to the gut, and apparently keeps it there for the rest of the story. He accumulates scratches on his face, but seems to come through without any lasting damage regardless. Obviously, action movie heroes are always superhuman when played by Arnie and Sly. But going back to the '70s, we had movies like 'The French Connection' and 'Dirty Harry' that really made you feel what the characters felt, precisely because they weren't indestructible. Perhaps it's not a relief from superhero movies that fans of the John Wick series are after, but just something that purports to be.It's a pretty good time, but also kind of underwhelming. There's lots of martial arts in the film, with people tangling their legs around each other and flopping this way and that - but Reeves isn't a gifted martial artist like Iko Uwais. The fighting scenes pale in comparison to any of the movies coming out of Indonesia in recent years.The movie also has a role call of amazing character actors, so many that I'm sure I'll forget a few. In fact, I'll forget some because they're not utilised well. I was unimpressed by their casting of Lance Reddick (of 'The Wire' fame) as a hotel porter in the previous film. He's back again, and gets a little more to do. But what about John Leguizamo, Peter Stormare, Franco Nero? They're barely given anything to do. Common could have been a memorable rival assassin, but the movie doesn't give him too many memorable moments.",6,0,0,2 October 2019
Annihilation," Tired approach to familiar material
","'Annihilation' is the story of a group of scientists and soldiers who journey into a mysterious, top secret environment where the normal laws of physics seem not to apply.Does this sound familiar? It should. It was done before, and better, by the great Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky in his film 'Stalker', which was itself an adaptation of the novel 'Roadside Picnic'.Being that this is not an original idea, 'Annihilation' really cries out for some kind of new, original approach to its familiar material. It does not happen upon one. I failed to mention above the fact that all the scientists and soldiers who enter the forbidden zone are female. Why did I not mention this? Because it harly seems to matter. Who cares what the gender of characters in a sci fi movie is? You watch it to have your mind blown with special effects, and your imagination dazzled with the impossible.The reason why I mention the gender of the protagonists now is because I fear that the filmmakers thought that having the main characters all be women is what passes for 'novel and original' these days. Nope, lads. 'Fraid not. We're not all gender studies professors. Most people don't care about that. Seeing women on the screen isnt that mind blowing. You couldn't come up with a new approach, so you just stuck relied on the old gender switch trick, as if it were the 1950s and anyone would be surprised at that.The only thing surprising is your lack of imagination.",6,0,1,11 December 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," A human story lost among the entrails
","Don't let the fact that 'Hacksaw Ridge' is about a pacifist fool you: it's just as graphically violent as you'd expect from a war movie directed by Gibson.'The Revenant' set a new standard with its opening war scene. 'Hacksaw Ridge' doesn't come close to it. Sure, it's violent, but it's also difficult to follow. So much attention is paid to all the different ways the human body can be destroyed by WWII era weaponry that you forget you're supposed to care about the individual lives being lost. Some of these scenes are so gruesome they approach ridiculousness, such as a soldier picking up the torso of a comrade - whose arms and legs were blown off - and running into battle, using him as a meat-shield.Did I mention this movie is about a pacifist? It doesn't exactly come to the fore, but then, none of the characters do. It's just blood, guts, explosions, death, mayhem.It almost makes you thankful the real Desmond Doss, whose story this is based on, didn't live to see this movie.",6,5,10,8 February 2017
Sully," Simple heroism, shown wonderfully
","It is strange, that in a movie-going landscape where it seems like every movie is at least two and a half hours, to see a movie that leaves you wanting more. 'Sully' wastes NO time in getting started with one of the most attention-grabbing opening scenes I've ever witnessed, and when it ends, it's over, with no superfluous denouement.'Sully' is also a rare movie that uses special effects when they are actually necessary. This is part of what makes them so attention grabbing. You are seeing what did happen and what could have happened, not just where the budget went.If there is a wrong note in the movie, it's Sully's wife, played by Laura Linney, an immensely gifted actress given nothing to do here but look concerned. You recognise her as an uninteresting staple character immediately: the realisation that it is Linney comes as a shock.'Sully' does boast a tremendous performance from Hanks, however. He, like the director Clint Eastwood, is more than willing to take a step back and let the simple heroism of the story come to the fore.",8,0,0,5 February 2017
The Wizard of Oz," I failed
","I feel I have failed 'Oz'. Like everyone else, I saw i when I was a kid, probably more than once, and I feel that parts of the movie became one with my imagination. I remember actually believing in the locations as places that could exist somewhere, and probably did.Watching it now, though, for the first time in over twenty-five years, I was a bit let down. It was impossible to believe in it as I had back then, which is not a problem I have had with other fantasy and sci fi pictures. With them, I can still suspend disbelief. With 'The Wizard of Oz', though, I felt like I was watching a play. Some of its effects are still impressive, like the first 'appearance' of the Wizard. But the sets and environments just seem too fake now.Also, I felt like there were too many songs. There's a reason why people only remember one or two songs from the movie, no matter how many times they've seen it. I'll admit it, though: I'm not a musical fan. I find it unpleasantly fake and tiresome when characters break into song.I am not one to review 'Wizard of Oz', but do so anyway, because I review every movie I watch.",7,0,1,9 February 2019
From Here to Eternity," A classic drama, with a superb performance from Montgomery Clift
","'From Here to Eternity' is the first movie I have seen in which Montgomery Clift plays a lead role. And what an introduction. Clift is superb in this movie, and certainly deserved the Oscar he was nominated for but did not win.I knew, going in, that the movie is set in the days before the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. I did not know that it also contained a drama so well acted that I would forget about that climactic event. The movie grabbed me from the beginning and wouldn't let go. I didn't care about the bombs and the planes and the kamikaze.Until they attacked. That has to be one of the best scenes of air-to-ground warfare I have seen in a movie.The movie is also notable for making a star out of Frank Sinatra, and that's nowhere near as bad as it sounds. Old Blue Eyes was no Elvis Presley: he could act as well as sing.Also, be on the lookout for that amazing actor, Ernest Borgnine. Who other than Borgnine could play a truly psychopathic bad guy - evil incarnate - as he does here, but also turn in a performance as a loveable lug, like he did in 'Marty'?I have to admit though, the romantic subplot with Burt Lancaster kind of left me cold, but I think that's just me. I've never been one for romance.",9,1,1,18 February 2019
