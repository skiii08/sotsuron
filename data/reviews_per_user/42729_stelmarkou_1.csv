The Longest Yard," Adam Sandler's best, excellent cast!!!
","What can one say about this film...it has it all, from car chase scene to policemen tackled, to gay inmates in prison to Chris Rock jokes.Absolutely fantastic comedy, Adam's Sandler's best yet. If you liked the old Mean Machine with Burt Reynolds then you will fall in love with this one.All prisoners and guards have been handpicked and I wouldn't change any of them.Nelly, Terry Crews and several other known celebrities work well together as a team and will be one of the films you never get bored of watching! Directing from Peter Segal is absolutely brilliant and during the game scenes it couldn't be any better!!!",9,0,2,3 December 2010
