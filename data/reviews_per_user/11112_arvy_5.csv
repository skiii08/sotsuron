Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Perfect DVD fodder, some amazing sketches, watch with friends and a few stimulants...
","Borat travels from the backward Kazakhstan to learn and inform his nation about Americans.This film is a concoction of sketches that you may or may or not have seen on the Ali G show (more likely if you are British) strung together with a road trip theme.Some of the sketches are superb - where where Borat is learning etiquette and the scene where he is winding up the local feminist chapter. In others he mocks anti-semitism (jews are able to trans-mutate).However the film is let down by not having a strong enough story, and some of the scenes are clearly staged. The final scene and the 'bear in the van ' scene are far too staged.I have to say I was a little disappointed by the anti-semitic elements, as well as the description of the black congressmen as a chocolate face. In one respect this is pure offence, in other you can see the comedian taking some risks.If anything I kind of wish he had taken more risks (there is a scene when a chicken might be killed, but of course animals can't be hurt, casual racism is OK, but animals can't be hurt).There is a scene where a fat-black prostitute crashes a dinner party, and this would be great if Woody Allen and Larry David hadn't already done this.However kudos is due to anyone who manages to offend a rodeo crowd in the manner that Borat does, as well as the naked wrestling scene, which I really hope I never have to watch again.Well done Peter Baynham (Armando Ianucci fans will know the name) and the ever talented Larry Charles for making this and hopefully making some cash.It could have been better, but watch it with some mates after a few and it will make you laugh.",5,2,6,17 November 2006
Underworld," one for real vampire fans only
","The opening scene looks like it is lifted straight out of the matrix with poorer light. Beckinsale plays a vampire who appears also to be wearing Carrie Ann_Moss's outfit from the Matrix as well.This is a film about vampires fighting for their place on earth and is connected to the mythology of the vampire line and their battle with the Lycans. All of this is explained in the movie, so I won't do so here.It isn't bad, but it really isn't great. There are a couple of good action scenes at each end of the film and the whole film seems to exist in the rain in some unknown eastern European town at an unspecified time.However this is thrown by the appearance of a 2003 maserati at one point! I couldn't help but thinking that Blade is just a better version of the genre, better action, better script, better effects.I'm sure a lot of the fans appreciate Beckinsale walking around in a nice catsuit, but to be honest she looks very small with large boots, and a posh English accent.If you really love your vampire films, this is a nice twist. If you just prefer decent films, watch 'Blade' and have done with it.ps Michael Sheen steals the show in this!",4,0,3,18 September 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Carrey on Form, tolerate the first 30 mins
","An original film.Winslet is very annoying in the first 10 minutes, but sit through it if you can. It pays off much later.Jim Carrey on very good form and his role in the film is worth it on its own. Winslet is a little on the annoying side (and if you aren't a fan of hers, you will hate the first few minutes) however she is clearly fulfilling a very specific role.This film deals with a 'kuki' love story and the bits that sometimes go wrong. Trust me on the first 30 minutes, it does get much better!It will make you think about relationships.",7,0,2,24 April 2006
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," A couple of good gags but wasted talent here
","Will Farrell, Vince Vaughn, even Stiller makes an appearancebut with the exception of the 'afternoon delight' song, there is little to commend this film.one gets the feeling that this was a bunch of 'SNL' mates just getting together with a bunch of their own in-jokes.if this were a British film it would be Peter's Friends.i.e. performed by people you know, some of whom have been in decent films, but ultimately this is a wasted effort. Only watch this if you are 'huge' fan of Will F.and also very light pastiches of the 70s.",4,1,2,24 May 2006
Casino Royale," Read Casino Royale - will help you enjoy
","although outdated, the book is a very good read. and a fair insight into why this Bond is different to the Connery/Moore/Brosnan bond.The first half is a bit slow and moody, but the second half of CR is superb.Set against the backdrop of the casino (in glorious Montenegro) the relationship between Bond and the main female actress (Vesper) is beautifully constructed.This is a much tougher Bond, very few gadgets (one really saves his life) and a Bond, just like the book, who isn't sure about his 'hired gun' status as a new '00'.The opening kill (one of the 2 required to get a '00') is gritty and unlike the sauve Bond kills you may be familiar with.Worth watching, but not always the glamour of previous Bonds.",6,0,1,7 December 2006
