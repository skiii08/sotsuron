Raiders of the Lost Ark," A fun movie, but ultimately disappointing
","Minor anachronisms in the interest of plot and convenience are fine, but it is annoying when a major plot line is based not only on something that didn't happen, but on something that couldn't have happened. It is laughable that the Nazis could have had a whole army charging around British-controlled Egypt in 1936.However, what really lets this film down is that it moves from one set piece to the next relying on dumb luck. Jones is evidently a smart man, yet he never uses his noggin. He never has a coherent plan. Ultimately, the day is saved by divine intervention (literally), rather than by any ingenuity on the part of Jones.It's like fast-food: enjoyable enough while you're consuming it, but ultimately unsatisfying.",Null,1,2,4 October 2004
