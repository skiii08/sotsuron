The Lobster," Why Brits need the French
","This is a great movie that seems very dystopian to Americans and, very likely, the French. Nonetheless, it's extremely romantic from the British perspective and explains why British couples frequently hire French couples to have children for them.What seem like awkward conversations to Americans are actually quite intimate -- by British standards of proper dialog. In deed, most of the conversations between couples is quite scandalous -- from a British point of view. If you're American (or French), you'll be wondering why they don't just say what they mean. The truth is, they are.This is one of the finest examples of British Romantic Comedy.",10,0,2,28 October 2017
