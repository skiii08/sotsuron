Hereditary," Insanely unsettling
","I am a horror fanatic and I have not seen a movie that has impressed me this much since the first time I saw The Shining. The director reminds me of a mixture of Lars Von Trier's encrypted mind and Wes Anderson's pleasing imagery. The narrative itself keeps the viewer guessing the genre which only adds to the suspense in having no idea where the movie could go. So wonderfully thought out, so incredibly visually pleasing. A must see for anyone who's a fan of horror, gore, drama, suspense, etc. I am in love with this movie.",10,49,96,12 June 2018
