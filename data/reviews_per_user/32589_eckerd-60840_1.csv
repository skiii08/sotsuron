It," Kids See Ghosts (sorry for bad english)
","I see some reviews with the rating 4-5/10 from 2017 and i think that its because of the hype around the film. Even before the premiere, many people called this movie as 'the best King adaptation' or 'best horror of the decade' etc. but we didn't got anything mind-blowing and people were disappointed, but that's a good horror movie with nothing special.
It's appearance wasn't good/terrifying at every single of his show-ups as Pennywise, but when he plays with the kids by showing up as their baddest fear or some traumatic character of their lives, it was really good. The jumpscares are lame in my opinion, except the projector scene. What's the best part? The kids. Phenomenal acting by all of them, and extra point for the writers that they doesn't wrote them as some innocent sacred children. Richie always talks/thinks about sex, and sometimes they swear harder than adults.
So It is a good horror movie if you dont believe the hype like 'best King adaptation'(better than The Shining or The Green Mile or Stand By Me or The Shawshank Redemption).",7,0,0,28 July 2019
