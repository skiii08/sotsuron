The Hangover," Amazing
","Honestly the funniest movie since Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Right up with it, and 40 Year Old Virgin.Has a completely different comedic style to the majority of the Apatow inspired comedies of the last few years (not that there's anything wrong with Judd's films). But at the same time, totally different, and MUCH better than Old School.Galifianakis is brilliant, and the cameos fit in perfectly. Even the way in which the protagonists piece together the events of the previous night is well woven and not disjointed in any way. It's been superbly put together.Just a great great comedy.",9,3,6,5 August 2009
