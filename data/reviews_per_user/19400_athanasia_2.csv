The Ring," not scary at all
","i had heard that this was 'the scariest movie ever' and was very excited to see it, unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. it wasnt scary at all, it was stupid and boring, there werent any cool special effects, and there were only two scenes worth seeing (two good scenes do not make a good movie). if you're looking for good horror, look elsewhere.",2,0,1,20 March 2003
American Psycho," lot's of fun
","i love this movie. it's one of those movies that you can watch  over and over and it's still just as funny and entertaining each time. the dialogue is wonderful, there are some many great quotes, and i like the director's use of color and lighting throughout the movie. i suppose that there are things in it that might offend certain people,  but if you can appreciate the absurdity of society with a bit a gore, you will love this movie. in fact, i have not met anyone who did not enjoy it!",10,0,1,31 August 2003
