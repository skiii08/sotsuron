Mission: Impossible III," Do Not Accept This Mission
","superstar Tom Cruise puts his perennially adolescent persona to the latest live action video game, Mission: Impossible III, and comes up with another non-stop assault on the senses.Designed to promote Cruise, Mission: Impossible III is standard action stuff from beginning to end. Cars blow up, rockets scream toward their target and a tormented protagonistCruise in his third outingbounces around as if he is made of rubber.Cruise's retired agent Ethan, now a trainer, is in love with a young woman which is like watching a soda pop commercial. It's a choppy introduction to the theme, if one can call it that, that work and love can co-exist.During a party to celebrate the couple's union, Cruise is beckoned to a convenience store, where he meets his boss (Billy Crudup). His mission: rescue a kidnapped female agent (Keri Russell, watchable as always) whom he trained. She's being held by Team Villain, led by Philip Seymour Hoffman in his first role since winning the Oscar for Capote.Action is admittedly not this writer's favorite genre and, having happily avoided seeing the first two in this franchise, very loosely based on a suspenseful TV drama, Mission: Impossible III was not a top choice. That said, it is not as terrible as was expected. For those who prefer action devoid of thought, it is downright acceptable.As the ear-splitting intervention unfolds in Berlin, Cruise loses an agent, whose flat-lined facial expression haunts him. He attends the funeral, flashes back and prepares for the next jaunt, all while trying to prove to his third-time cohort, Ving Rhames, that marriage can be compatible with career. Two others on the team, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and someone named Maggie Q, play along purely for show. Nothing lasts much longer than a couple of seconds.Next stop, the Vatican, which is believable if you accept that technology can conjure a perfect likeness of another human beingvoice, hair and facein under a few minutes. Whizzing by to avoid even a nanosecond of scrutiny, this section is the most thrilling, though it is completely implausible, with a chi-chi cocktail party inside the Vatican, manholes, men's rooms and, naturally, a briefcase. This time, Cruise gets the job done.He inexplicably loses his temper, presumably tossing out ten years of Impossible Mission Force (IMF) training in an embarrassingly histrionic display in which his identity becomes known to Hoffman's snide villain. Faster than you can say True Lies, a bridge is ambushed, the wife is taken captive and it's off to China to watch Cruise do his robotic running like he did in his last picture, the unbearable War of the Worlds.As he did in that movie, Cruise wells up repeatedly, befitting the picture's dominant emotion: chronic fear. Cruise does his regular routine of facial expressions and posturescocky, intense, victimizedand includes the Risky Business sunglasses.The action, something to do with a conspiracy involving Hoffman's weapons dealer, is too quick, jerky and hard to follow, heavy on close-ups, with plot and character development in low gear and hokey dialog that doesn't match. But the big caboodle bumps and bustles. It's not here to make sense.As the top IMF dude Laurence Fishburne adds stature and the cast on screen for what feels like eight minutes per actor, enters and exits on cue. The movie, pumped, zipped and ready to ship, belongs to Cruise, still filling the screen with his practiced smirk and making all the right moves in the wrong direction.",10,6,12,5 May 2006
Shutter Island," Shutter Island
","For probably the first time, I was very excited about a Scorsese film. I have been left cold by nearly every film I've seen of his, either due to subject matters that I just cannot bring myself to care about or I'm generally unimpressed by the film. There are exceptions of course as Gangs of New York was flawed but very powerful and The Last Temptation of Christ is a masterpiece, but despite a blip here and there over the years, Scorsese generally makes films that don't speak to me.Well, with Shutter Island he had me. I have a weak spot for psychological thrillers set in historical asylums. I gravitate towards these films, and when they work, they quickly find their places among my favorites. I found myself comparing the trailers for Shutter Island with Brad Anderson's Session 9 and the detective films of Kiyoshi Kurosawa (i.e. Cure, Retribution). i assumed that Martin Scorsese was influenced by the amazing atmosphere of the Japanese detective thrillers and was making his own. If Shutter Island hails from those influences, it doesn't succeed in duplicating the tone or attention to setting. Sadly, Shutter Island instead tries to be a M. Night Shyamalan film without the tension and unlike, Shyamalan, Scorsese gives away the twist immediately. Calling Shutter Island a disappointment is an understatement.Stop reading now if you want to avoid spoilers, because I'm about to give away everything.My biggest issue with Shutter Island is that nothing holds together and the more I think about it, the more annoyed I get. I hate movies that depend upon a big reveal at the end that finally explains everything. The biggest problem is that they almost never hold up to repeat viewings. Well, if Shutter Island had worked up until the lame and blatantly obvious reveal that Teddy Daniels is criminally insane, then I'd just be annoyed with it in the way that I am at the filmography of Shymalan, i.e. I was entertained the first time, but it completely falls apart with any scrutiny . If one could say the same for Shutter Island, it was be a complement.The problem is that the whole premise of Shutter Island is completely retarded. I realized to my disappointment very early on that Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) was not on the island to reveal a conspiracy, but as a patient. But are we really supposed to buy this plot? Would a mental hospital allow a delusional patient to wander about their facility for a few days playing detective in order to determine if he can be cured? Shutter Island's biggest failure is that it didn't make a lick of narrative sense. I enjoyed some of the dream sequences, but again, they allowed the truth of Teddy Daniels' crime to be so obvious as to made the last 30 minutes of the movie unnecessary for anyone who was awake during the first half-hour. In fact, the second half of the movie bludgeons you with Teddy's actual story, which was evident from the not so subtle clues throughout.However, there was one completely unforgettable part of the reveal. The moment that Dr. Cawley (Sir. Ben Kingsley) brings out the visual aids to show Teddy that all of the names in his conspiracy plot are anagrams, was the best bit of unintentional comedy that I've seen all year. But then, what could have been a downright cool detective thriller investigating the very horrific practices that happened in asylums during the first half of the 20th century, we get another movie with a non-nonsensical plot that is simply explained by the protagonist being insane. Yawn. My advice is to watch Quills, Session 9, or The American Experience: The Lobotomist for some intense, horrifying stories of mental institutions.",Null,1,1,4 April 2010
Capote," one of the most overrated 'critic's picks' of the year
","I can honestly say that this is yet another highly-touted film that I simply didn't appreciate all that much (this thing is up for Best Picture of the year at the Oscars?). Even the across-the-board praise for Philip Seymour Hoffman is a little over the top, in my opinion, as he certainly does possess this guy's look, voice and mannerisms, but as a character with emotional ups and downs, I didn't see all that much variation in this guy from beginning to end. Basically, the guy's a highly intelligent, manipulative, self-absorbed guy, who uses these killers' vulnerabilities against them, so that he could write the 'greatest non-fiction novel' of all-time. So am I supposed to care about this guy? Oddly enough, the one actor in the film who did truly capture some humanity in his performance was Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith, one of the 'cold-blooded' murderers. Not unlike Sean Penn in the highly effective DEAD MAN WALKING, Collins portrayed real emotion in his guy, straining to come through to our side, but finding it difficult to fight against his lifetime of ugliness. Now why Catherine Keener is being mentioned for anything other than a passable portrayal of a woman who basically just stands around Capote the whole picture while not saying or doing much, is also beyond meThe good points about the film? Well, its final 10-15 minutes certainly come through as the stagnancy of the film's mid-section is finally budged with some actual intrigue, emotion and resolution. For the most part, the film moves at a slow pace and features scene after scene of Capote speaking to either Perry Smith or messing around with his friends and telling them how great he is, while drinking and smoking up a storm. Sure, Capote's grandiose personality is fun to watch at times (if only because the guy's a mess and doesn't seem to know it)Granted, the film looked great, its opening cinematography work in Kansas was splendid, Hoffman certainly acted like the real Truman Capote, Collins Jr. was memorable and the fact that all of the talk ultimately affected Capote in a negative manner was a decent stuff, but the film itself was a little too long, moved a little too slow, and didn't really pull me into the murderers' back story or Capote's inner being",5,1,2,24 February 2006
Inside Man," enjoy the cool, smooth ride.
","'Inside Man' stars Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, and Jodie Foster  all bringing their A-games and mustering up all the movie star fire power they can. They are joined in able support by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Christopher Plummer, consecutively one of my favorite young actors and one of my favorite old-schoolers. Director Spike Lee has ventured outside of his familiar and crafted a very interesting and entertaining bank heist/perfect crime caper. But there's a lot more going on here than the meets the eye. With a deft screenplay by newcomer Russell Gewirtz, Lee delivers a crackerjack action drama that also serves as a gentle treatise on how we treat each other in this country. As a plus, Spike sells this message subtly this time out and not in the usual ham-fisted style that he has employed in the past.The film begins with a tight medium full on the mug of Owen, explaining that he is Dalton Russell and hinting that things are not always as they seem. This monologue segues into a sight of four people dressed as painters entering the lobby of Manhattan Trust, a Wall Street branch of a worldwide financial institution. (Think Citibank/Citigroup with charitable do-gooder Chairman Plummer as a Sanford Weill wannabe.) The robbery is underway, hostages are taken and the crime becomes a highly scrutinized red-ball media event that drags on for the better part of a day. The bank robbers seem to stay one step ahead of the police department at every turn, but what exactly is going on here? Washington plays NYPD hostage negotiator Detective Keith Frazier. He heads the operation to make contact with ringleader Russell and insure the safety of the hostages. Frazier is newly promoted and somewhat immersed in a corruption scandal. He sees the siege as an opportunity to prove his worth, make the grade and clear his name all at the same time. Two-time Oscar winner Washington gives yet another unimpeachable portrayal that does not disappoint. (Has this man ever given a poor performance?) His Frazier is charming, stalwart and quite droll. His presentation of this man in above his head is never stronger than when he has absolutely no idea what to expect next. Washington can always cut the dashing figure, but his best work occurs when he is brought low and his characters are forced to rely on something besides their physicality and allure. As expected, he serves as the principled center to this labyrinthine tale of greed, morals and corruption. Washington's work here continues his celebrated successful collaborative relationship with Lee.Casting Clive Owen as Washington's adversary was a sharp and necessary move. It takes an actor of serious fortitude, appeal and strong sense of self to stand toe to toe with Washington and not crumble in Denzel's wake. As the mastermind behind the break-in, the winning Brit more than holds his own in scenes with Washington and Foster, who plays mysterious power broker Madeline White. There is an intelligence and determination behind those icy blue eyes of steel. He's an enigma, a genius criminal literally sitting on top of a pile of money that's his for the taking, but with no clear exit strategy. It is a masterful confluence of direction, writing and acting and the audience is rewarded with a modern deluxe throwback to the golden era of Sidney Lumet movies. You get the sense that everyone involved couldn't wait to show up for work, tell this story and create these scenes together., Jodie Foster makes another appearance as a supporting character. She is quite compelling as White, a Machiavellian fixer with seemingly no humanity inside herself whatsoever. As she clomps around Manhattan in designer shoes that seem entirely too high and uncomfortable for her (), she exudes authority and avarice. And it's a delightful irony as she is decidedly so much physically smaller than all the big studs around her. There are a couple of chilling scenes with Plummer where's she appears to have ice in her veins. She's not alone though, every character has their own secrets and agenda and it's simply a matter of waiting to see what happens when irresistible forces collide with immovable objects.Spike applies his singular vision throughout the film and never at the sake of his audience's enjoyment. He says what he wants to say about race, religion, money, history and morality in this country, but this time without the screaming. There is the expected marvelous camera-work and clever imagery which as always in the case of a Spike Lee Joint, is accompanied by the plaintive wails of a standard yet sublime score by Terence Blanchard. There is a scene where Washington and Ejiofor turn a corner in a hallway and advance upon the camera at a brisk walking pace. Lee photographs these stunning examples of Beautiful Black Men so lovingly and at such an angle it gives one pause and truly takes the breath away. And Lee knows how to film New York City in such a way that the metropolis itself actually becomes a character in the film.It is by no means a perfect film but it is highly entertaining and worthwhile. The narrative still does come across a bit murky in the third act and there are some lags in action, but these are minor complaints. Go see 'Inside Man' for the performances, the script, and the opportunity to see a seasoned vanguard director stretch his wings within an entirely different form. Welcome to the mainstream Spike",7,4,6,24 March 2006
V for Vendetta," Awesome! Easily the best movie to come out so far this year,
","packed with plenty of style, bunches of action, various interlinked interesting and engaging characters, a contemporary message that cannot be missed and a couple of attractive leads, both of whom bring forth developed personas, as well as an intriguing relationship, all wrapped up in a giant ball of entertainment. That's right, if you didn't think that a movie can both entertain on a visceral level and warn you about the dangers of 'too much government' at the same time, prepare yourself to be stupefied as VENDETTA does just that, and does it all in style, grace and a wicked pace that doesn't even give you a second to consider the possibility of getting bored(it's just not going to happen). I was engrossed by this film from scene one all the way through its many deviations, surprises, twists and terrorist turns, as it continually kept things moving, while at the same time, allowing us to follow the events as a detective mightfiltering through all of the clues and twists dropped throughout. Who is this V character? Why did they shave Natalie Portman's head? What really happened to her parents? All pertinent questions which are all slowly responded to, as this futuristic English society begins to crack under the pressure. For me, the film made me question stuff, exhilarated me at various moments (the final 'fight sequence' was poetry in motionoh, and bloody!), allowed me to relax and enjoy some of its quieter times (the scenes between V and Portman in his underground lair were romantic and Portman dressed up as a lolita was good and ultimately engaged me in a circle of curiosity throughout. The ending wasn't as unpredictable as you might expect, but that was fine, since it was the journey that was the enjoyment for me. The film also had style with everything looking very slick, dark and deadly. It also had a tinge of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE undercurrent working below it, which is always nice. Kudos to all of the actors in the show as well, since their commitments to the characters were also part of what made this film come alive, and extra props to Portman for bringing home her A-game and even Hugo Weaving, who might have had the hardest job of allemoting stuff behind a frozen mask. But you know whathe did it! I felt for this guy and that's the sign of a great actor. All in all, don't go into this film expecting a wham-bam-thank-you-Wachowki type of flick, because it's far from that. This movie contains more ideas than action, more politics than thrills and more ideology than bullet-time, but in the endit does deliver in a little bit of everything, and for methat's always welcome in this world of rehashes and remakes . Viva la V for Vendettafinally, some guts on the big screen! Oh, and if you've always wondered what the difference was between a terrorist and a freedom fighterwonder some more.",10,1,5,17 March 2006
