The Longest Yard," The modern version of TLY, to be compared with Mean Machine
","After 15 minutes I already noticed that this movie its concept is almost he same as the soccer variant with Vinnie Jones, called Mean Machine (which also is the name of the football team adam sandler is leading against the guards later on in the movie) The original of the Longest Yard was probably the first in it's genre, but if you want to compare this movie, do it with the modern variant: Mean Machine. The story is almost the same, A famous sportsman get's in jail for bribing, faking the football games. He get's molested by the headguard, the warden wants him to coach the soccer/football team, there are inmates who 'can get you anything you need' .. and this is everything that happens within 15 minutes and it's almost identical as in Mean Machine. The only difference is that this movie is less British, and more in an American Style. I enjoyed this movie more then mean machine because it has funnier and better casted characters in it, especially the inmates are enjoyable. The rest of the story is to be guessed, Sandler starts a team of inmates to take it up against the Guards team. It only took me 17 minutes of the movie to figure this all out. It isn't a movie to criticise, because it is a COMEDY which is made to make you laugh and entertain you during the movie. Which it quite succeeds in. its just damn hilarious, even Rob Schneider has 2 sentences in it like he always has a small role in Sandlers movies. Go see it ;)",7,0,0,9 September 2005
