The Blair Witch Project," It blows
","The movie was a waste of time and money. Well, some good moments, but for the most part it is not even remotely worth the hype surrounding it. I'd recommend against going to see it. There are lots of movies out there that are more worth seeing.",Null,0,1,19 August 1999
