Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," No idea what this was about
","Something about anarchists and tensions between France and Germany, a gypsy fortune teller of indeterminate nationality with a missing brother who at one point I thought was buried in a basement but shows up at a peace conference/ballroom dance high up in the Alps. Oh, and throw in an evening at the opera, a dead dog brought to life with a shot of adrenaline to its heart, and a severe case of TB communicated apparently by teacups. On top of this, all the male characters come across as gay. Holmes seems jealous of Watson's marriage; Holmes's brother acts like Oscar Wilde; Watson dances at a ball with Holmes, etc. Maybe this was an intentional subtext but just seemed odd.",1,79,156,21 December 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Loved it!
","This movie felt like a throwback to the 1970s, when a director and his editor would let a story unfold without a quick cut or CGI dinosaur bursting out of a hedge every 15 seconds to wake the audience from its diabetic stupor. It was hardly confusing--there are 2 story lines which intersect eventually, and flashback scenes which you can tell are flashbacks by watching Smiley's glasses. The slower pace allows you to drank in the seventies London scenery and permits the tension to build immeasurably. The last 5 minutes, played over a cheesy Christmas song, was the most inspired ending to a movie that I've seen in years. Wonderful all around!",9,1,2,11 January 2012
American Hustle," Strip out the period costumes and music and what are you left with?
","Terribly unfunny, overlong; this movie goes for the cheapest possible laughs. Like all period movies, the actors constantly have to struggle to surmount the weird hairdos--none succeed. Jennifer Lawrence was ATROCIOUS, too broad, like a parody. Neither the Amy Adams character nor the Christian Bale character were remotely sympathetic. I guess we were supposed to get caught up in their love story (?) or feel sorry that Bale has a heart condition (who cares?) The movie uses too much voice-over in the first half hour, which is always the sign of lazy storytelling. Even when the voice-over disappears the storytelling doesn't pick up. The entire movie felt like a rush job; another year or two honing the screenplay might have resulted in a decent movie.3/10 stars.",3,3,6,14 February 2014
