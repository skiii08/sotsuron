Casablanca," A Classic - great acting, directing, dialog & music - but has bad story flaws
","Like all movie fans, I love the movie Casablanca. It's in the top 15 of my list of favorite movies. It is truly a classic. Its great actors, director, music, dialog, and romance arouse deep emotion. According to the film's makers, Casablanca was one of those amazing unexpected successes that fate occasionally surprises us with. Apparently no one involved in making this movie expected it to be the famous classic it became. Reportedly, some of the actors and film makers nearly turned it down because the script just seemed like another unremarkable war movie. What I find amazing is that it is set in late 1941, less than a year before it was written, filmed, edited and released; long before World War 2 even ended. Some reports claim it was a propaganda film; not sure that's true.Casablanca contains two scenes that are among favorites of mine. The scene in which Ilsa and Laszlo first meet Sam and Rick in Rick's nightclub. And the scene in which Laszlo tells the nightclub orchestra to play the French national anthem to counter a group of Nazi officers loudly singing a patriotic German song; all the patrons then join in singing the French anthem, totally drowning out the Nazis. The emotion aroused by these and many other scenes in this film attest to the talent of the director, actors, film editors, music composers, and production staff.But, although Casablanca is a very moving experience that captivates its audience, its story plot and subplots have very bad faults, at some points downright absurd. These are known among critics, authors, and even war historians. I'm a terrible stickler for detail by nature and I can't help but absorb all aspects of a movie. I consider these story flaws unfortunate because the screenplay is otherwise beautifully written; it won an Academy award. Casablanca also won Academy awards for best picture and best director, all very much deserved. The main criticism with the story is the fictitious 'letters of transit' which are supposed to be some sort of super passport, and would certainly have to possess supernatural powers to wield the effect and great value depicted in this story. The letters (plural for some reason) play a key role in the plot. There are many flaws in this concept and in the entire story; it really becomes ridiculous at points. So, being the admitted (nearly anal?) stickler for detail that I am, I've actually listed some of those flaws below for anyone interested:1) First, of course, there's no such thing as letters of transit, never has been. It would seem that a simple forged passport or visa would be a better travel authorization in 1941 unoccupied Morocco.2) If there were such documents, they could easily be revoked and made useless, just as any document can, and just as governments routinely do with passports that are reported lost or stolen. The purported rareness of these letters, which is supposed to make them so ridiculously valuable, would actually make them much more a risk and a red flag in travel rather than an aid (unless they cause inspectors and soldiers to go into magical trances).3) Suppose the far-fetched premise is true that these letters are worth over 200,000 francs in 1941 (about $100,000 in today's U.S. dollar). One could easily have them forged for far less. Passports and exit visas are being forged throughout this movie. If government passports can be forged, with their special paper, cryptic engravings and invisible watermarks, then letters and signatures can easily be forged.4) Again, assume the letters really are that valuable. You'll realize, as I think everyone watching this movie realizes, Ugarte's dumb assumption that by handing the letters temporarily over to Rick somehow safeguards these valuable papers, is absurd. Ugarte could protect them a thousand times better by simply burying them or hiding them in a bush or under an old shed. And savvy Rick would certainly know this. But of course it's important to the story plot for Rick to possess these magic letters. As for Rick's piano hiding place, a 10 year old kid could find a more secure place.5) Lastly (but not least), Rick's plan proposed to Renault is nonsense. He tells Renault to release Laszlo from petty charges so Rick can lure him into buying the transit letters. Renault is then supposed to arrest Laszlo and turn him over to the Nazis who can then supposedly imprison Laszlo for many years for the serious crime of possessing the letters. In the meantime Rick and Ilsa will be on the plane to Lisbon, using the omnipotent transit letters for travel. What's wrong with this picture? The absurdity is that Laszlo won't be in possession of the letters, Rick and Ilsa will. How will this incriminate Laszlo? Or are the Nazis going to give the letters back to Rick after Laszlo is in prison so that Ilsa and Rick can flee? Totally absurd. Even Renault would be smart enough to see that.But, again with all of that said, Casablanca's other qualities are so great that they outweigh the drawbacks. It is still a brilliantly directed and beautifully produced classic. It's just a bit of a shame that more time wasn't spent developing a more realistic plot. That would have made it a near perfect film.",9,1,3,4 March 2015
Gravity," Gravity is a masterpiece!
","First I must start out by saying that Sandra Bullock's performance in the lead role of Gravity was absolutely superb! I don't think anyone could have performed it as well as her. As far as I'm concerned she's the best actress of 2013. George Clooney was also superb as veteran astronaut commander Matt Kowalski. I just can't see any two people doing as good a job as these two stars.But that's just the starting line-up. The special effects and visual effects engineered by the ultra-professional organization 'Framestore' were no less than spectacular! The orbiting spacecraft simulations, weightlessness, zero-gravity kinetics, impacts, and motion were so real that they seemed like miracles of cinematography. I simply can't say enough about the people who created these amazing special effect sequences. Their work is the main reason I agree with James Cameron and Anthony Scott when they said that Gravity has rewritten the rules of cinema as we know them, making Gravity the best space film ever made.I'm an aerospace engineer, and there were a few scientific inaccuracies and some slightly far-fetched premises in the movie. But given the premises, Gravity's accuracy and realism is second to none in the movie industry. It is difficult to call this film science fiction because, although the story is fictitious, the science is very realistic.Finally, Alfonso Cuaron is the main person responsible for this great film. He directed, co-produced with David Heyman, and co-wrote Gravity with his son Jonas. He has been nominated for best director, he and Heyman for best picture by the Academy Awards, and he has won or been nominated for numerous Golden Globe and British Film Academy awards for Gravity. I think he deserves to win them all! Gravity is a masterpiece!",10,2,4,24 February 2014
Star Trek," just another B action movie
","Did not like this movie. Just a poor action thriller clone of the Star Wars fantasy opera, complete with finale hero award ceremony. Cowboys and Indians in outer space. Full of action and special effects, but juvenile with shallow characters that appeal to a 12 or 13 year old. But then the action movie industry audience is predominantly age 13 intelligence level. Movies like this are usually successful teen money makers. The special effects, and the Spock and Scottie characters just slightly salvage the film (to three points). The Bones character was embarrassingly obvious in his attempt to mimic Leonard McCoy of the original series. There are much better Star Trek films and series episodes.",3,2,4,22 March 2011
Interstellar," Interstellar is fantasy, not science fiction
","Although the visual effects are good, Interstellar (shouldn't it be 'Intergalactic'?) is just too far-fetched. It's nothing like the believable film of human planetary migration that I was led to believe, and was hoping for. I've never been a fantasy fan. I majored in electrical-electronics engineering and physics in my 6 years of college, so I am a bit of a nerd and science stickler. When I view (or read) science fiction, to me the 'fiction' should apply to the story, not to the science. In fantasy, the fiction applies to the science. Personally, I wish the film industry would make more realistic dramas about human space exploration. Hollywood's blockbuster profit machine abandons serious science fiction art, and, like Prometheus, made Interstellar into another action-packed CGI thriller crapper that caters to 13 to16 year-olds (the large demographic of movie going audience-$$$). And, of course, no sex, violence, horror, or language to get it an R rating.Interstellar's story is quite crazy. In it we humans, in the very distant future, discover how to communicate backward in time somehow by using gravity. Also, we (or they?) discover how to create crazy things like wormholes anywhere in time and space. Both of these things are quite insane. Anyway, our future humans supposedly use their fantastic smarts to send us (present humans) subtle messages that help in our quest to migrate to another planet, because earth is presently dying. And here's a real clincher, apparently our future selves have a morbid sense of humor, because they don't send us clear-cut messages (like any sensible race would do), they make it a silly game by sending mysterious coded riddles that we have to first solve. Things like coded binary numbers sent by arranging the books on the shelves in a young girl's bedroom; the numbers turn out to be coordinates to a giant secret underground NASA spaceship factory located below cornfields. Another mystery message leads us to a wormhole near the planet Saturn that our future super humans have kindly created for us, and maintained there. This fantastic (and quite absurd) wormhole leads to a cluster of candidate earth-like planets in a distant galaxy. But our future relatives don't want to make the game too easy, so the next step requires us to build numerous spacecraft, fly to and thru the wormhole, and explore the candidate planets to find which one is the jackpot. While doing this our explorers encounter all kinds of treacherous and crazy things, like planets with mile-high waves in 18-inch deep water, entering and exiting a rotating black hole, mentally unstable astronauts, and surviving and navigating fantastic spacecraft thru enormous gravitation fields that cause relativistic time dilation leaving an astronaut younger than his daughter. Typical things that any astronaut would experience over a few years right.I read that physicist Kip Thorne was a consultant for this film, and he said he tried to keep it as authentic as possible. Well, he really stretched authentic here. I agree with ASU physicist Lawrence Krauss. I don't think Thorne served physics well working with this film. Oh I don't argue with his gravitational lensing, or other more straight forward aspects like the time dilation and the rotating black hole 'gargantua'. But things like our future ancestors communicating backward in time via gravity, and creating wormholes? Or like Cooper entering into a singularity, reversing time, fidgeting with the past (multiverses?), and then exiting? I'm not sure what world Thorne is living in to call all that authentic. For example, take the wormhole (..please!). This hypothetical concept is a physics metaphor used in teaching general relativity. Many people may not know that there is absolutely no evidence or accepted scientific theory suggesting that wormholes actually exist in any form anywhere, or, even more fantastic, can be created and traversed by humans. In fact the inconceivable energy, matter, and forces alone involved with such a hypothetical warp would make it impossible for humans to 'create' one. Black holes, on the other hand, are not only scientifically known to be possible, but are known to exist. Entering and exiting the event horizon of a rotating black hole is purely hypothetical, and is certainly not considered scientifically possible, partly because literally nothing is known about black hole singularity. Yet all these things are depicted in very silly fantasy in Interstellar. Also, I swore I saw a 2013 Dodge Ram pickup and a cute robot with artificial human intelligence in the movie. Fantasy. It appeals to the target child audience.Not only the wacky science, but the excessive pace of Interstellar made for a poor film. There's no pausing to smell roses in this film. The fast pace hindered character development and made for shallow story development. Frankly, I can't remember being so happy to see a movie end. It became a struggle to watch. Also, a lot of McConaughey's speech seemed to be at whisper level bordering on mumble, which I found irritating. The background music was okay, but not great.I consider the films Gravity, and my favorite, Alien (1979), much better. They aren't perfect realism, but at least they don't have ghosts from the future and manmade wormholes.In closing, I must say that I truly do believe humanity will someday migrate from earth, but it will NEVER be anything like this movie depicts. How sure am I of this? If I'm wrong I hereby promise to pay each living human being in the universe a million dollars. Being able to afford that is more probable than the science in this film.",5,4,8,26 February 2015
Fargo," Great movie, but FALSE
","I don't care for this movie only because it makes a grossly false claim. As a film it has very good qualities, but the introduction states that this movie depicts a true story, which is an outright lie perpetrated by the Coen brothers to mislead the public and boost ticket sales. The false statement should be removed, and the Academy should not have allowed this film into competition until it is removed. The film also depicts the people of Minnesota and North Dakota in a derogatory stereotype, which is also false. For decades conservatives and right wingers have denounced the movie industry as immoral, which I've always found to be totally untrue. But when idiots like this start lying and presenting false or inaccurate information as fact, it starts to makes me wonder. TELL THE TRUTH for crap sake!",2,1,6,9 June 2014
Quantum of Solace," James Bond is Rambo
","Daniel Craig is fantastic, but this movie is a big disappointment. It's a string of up-close, shaky-camera action sequences threaded into a fleeting meaningless bad movie. Lacks story development, character development, depth, suspense, intrigue, suave spy drama, etc etc. There's nothing wrong with great action, but a great story, screenplay, and dramatic acting are required for a great movie.The cast is fine, and the actor Daniel Craig has the potential to be the best Bond ever. Even more, he has the potential to elevate a James Bond film to the ranks of a classic movie. Broccoli's finally come upon another great Bond actor (Sean Connery was the first), now she just needs a quality team of professionals to write, direct, and film Bond movies.",4,3,4,2 December 2008
Eyes Wide Shut," Another great movie by the brilliant Stanley Kubrick
","Excellent film; a classic thriller; another Stanley Kubrick masterpiece (may he rest in peace). This movie captivates the audience with Kubrick's movie making genius and artistic brilliance. Not to mention great acting by the entire cast, especially Tom Cruise. From beginning to end, the camera work, cinematography, acting, film editing, soundtrack, and story development are exquisite.In the story Kubrick combines the intense subject of human sexuality with the frightening suspense of a secret society; all done in the powerful Kubrick reality style. I'm a big fan of films with the mysterious secret society angle, and this one is the absolute best of them all. This film is a work of art.",9,2,3,5 October 2009
Prometheus," Another disappointing attempt to squeeze more Alien blood
","This movie, like all other sequels to the 1979 movie 'Alien' (in this case also called a 'prequel', I guess), was a big disappointment to me, as I think it is to all serious science fiction lovers. I think I'm even more disappointed in Ridley Scott for directing it. Prometheus is another feeble attempt to squeeze more blood from the 1979 classic film. Prometheus did make a lot of money at the box office by appealing to the dumb and young movie audience masses, and will probably make more profit in other media. I guess one really can't fault film producers for wanting to get rich in their retirement. The plot of Prometheus convolves the original Alien story into a whacky futuristic thriller adventure in order to maximize use of CGI, and appeal to the 12 year old intelligence level, which is the largest demographic sector of the movie-going public.The original film, Alien, a great classic and favorite of mine since I first saw it as a young man with my girlfriend in a 1979 movie theater, has been the source of many poor efforts to capitalize on its greatness and fame. Granted, some of the original movie's special effects could have been better, but its story, film editing, visual effects, directing, camera work, screenplay, script, and acting were pure science fiction genius, brought together to make a beautiful classic suspense film that I am now convinced will never be improved upon, mainly because the film industry is driven by profit rather than art. Personally, I think it would be nice if film makers stopped getting a piece of the 1979 film action, and concentrate more on creating new original, serious science fiction motion picture art.",6,1,2,14 January 2015
Mother!," Don't let the story confuse you
","While viewing this movie and contemplating its roller coaster of twisting developments and multiple subplots, I, like all viewers, was perplexed during most of it, and intently tried to figure out the mysterious plot as the story unfolded. And believe it or not, I actually did figure out the correct conclusion before the shocking end: it's a load of manure!This film is 100% RUBBISH! It is not art, drama, horror, suspense, contemporary production, acting, writing, directing, or anything whatsoever. It is simply the most pathetic bunch of garbage ever put on film. A rating of 1 is infinitely greater than it deserves, but zero rating is not an option on IMDb's web page.There are many efforts underway in the film industry to preserve films, mostly through digital means, in order to prevent historical and great movies from being lost to future generations. This film and all its copies should, instead, be purposely destroyed in order to prevent it from ever wasting anyone's time again.I've not tested this in practice so don't quote me, but I'm quite sure that someone who considers this film as art, or rates it above a five, could be proven in a court of law to be certifiably crazy, and legally institutionalized. (just kidding.. somewhat).",1,7,9,13 December 2019
Sully," The true story of a great modern hero; everybody should see this terrific film!
","He was smarter than the air traffic controllers, the NTSB investigators, the flight simulator pilots, the flight simulation computers; he even outsmarted fate itself. On January 15, 2009 in New York City, 155 airline passengers and crew, plus an unknown number of people on the ground were all spared from a horrible and fiery death that fate had planned for them on that day. All their lives were saved because of one fact: the brain of Captain Chesley Sullenberger was in the cockpit of US Airways flight 1549 on that day.Forget about presidents, royalty, movie stars, or great scientists; if I could choose one famous person that I could meet before I die, it would be Chesley Sullenberger.Excellent directing, acting, screenplay, editing, and special effects; but mostly, the true story of a great modern hero. Everybody should see this terrific film!",10,4,7,1 December 2016
