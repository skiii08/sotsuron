The Blair Witch Project," Breath Taking
","This movie was no less then terrifying. I sat in my seat feeling their pain and fear. That was the best part of the film, the fear was so believable. I also found myself laughing at times. Both the light humor and the extreme terror added together to make an extraordinary movie.",10,1,2,30 July 1999
