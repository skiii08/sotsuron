Scarface," Great pair up between Oliver Stone and Brian DePalma
","This movie is one of my favorites (In fact its in my Top 5). Great acting by Pacino, great dialouge and excellent scripts (Thanks to Mr. Stone) good directing and good cast (Thanks to Mrs. DePalma). The end is so awesome!! I recomend this to anyone, its so great. Its about a Cuban reffugae comes to America and starts selling drugs and goes big time, he has sports cars, mansions, everything then things start to spiral out of control.. great movie. Lots of fun!**************** out of ***** (Yeah its that good!!lol)",Null,0,0,23 January 2004
True Romance," Quentin Tarantino's best written movie
","This is an excellent movie and is defentely one of my favorites. There are alot of actors in this film that were really unkown then and are big now. The cast consist of Christian Slater (Windtalkers), Patrica Arquette (Stigmata),Dennis Hopper(Knockaround Guys),Val Kilmer (The Salton Sea),Gary Oldman (Hannibal),Brad Pitt (Se7en), and Christopher Walken (Pulp Fiction). Theres also alot of supporting roles with Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn and even a small part with Sameul L. Jackson. There is tons of violence and also a very good climatic ending. Directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun)and written by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) they both show some of there styles such as Scott's great action sequences and Tarantino's great dialouge. 5/5 starsRated R for Strong Violence, Pervasive Langauge,Drug use, and Brief Nudity",Null,1,2,1 May 2004
