The Ring," Good, but not scary
","The Ring is a pretty solid idea, reminiscent of The Changeling with George C. Scott, and the story keeps you interested. The acting was fine, given the rather poor, at times, dialogue the actors had to work with. It just fell short on actually scaring the audience, unlike the Changeling, and wasn't able to convince me how terribly frightening such a situation would be, if indeed ghosts were real and cared to scare anybody. Other than that it was a fine movie and worth a shot, but I do have a problem with Hollywood's insistence that it pours when it rains here in Seattle. It doesn't pour here, it just drizzles mostly, or softly rains.",8,0,0,10 November 2002
