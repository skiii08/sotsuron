Captain Phillips," An AMAZING movie, go out and watch it!
","This was just all in all, a great film. It kept you on the edge of your seat pretty much the whole way through. If I had to complain about it, it did start off a bit slow, and it got kind of boring at scenes. (It WAS a 2 and a half hour movie)but it was mostly really good. The acting was phenomenal, especially from Tom Hanks and it was just done really well, the way they filmed it and how it played out. It was exciting, thrilling and emotional. When I came out of the theater, I said to my friend 'It was so good that it was horrible!' What I mean by that is, the ending was just so, well I can't really explain it without giving spoilers but because of this, it was GOOD. This is my first review and I right away knew that I wanted to do this one, (I just saw it last night). Anyways, I definitely recommend it and I originally gave it an 8 out of 10 but now that I'm thinking about it again, I give it a 9 out of 10. GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!",8,0,5,22 October 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," The Best Movie You'll Ever See. I Will Become Your New Favorite
","This is just my favorite movie of all time. I really wanted to do a review on it and here it is. GO-WATCH-THIS-MOVIE! Don't rent it. Buy it. This is such an amazing movie, it's on the best movies list for IMDb for a reason. It keeps you entertained and most of all, it is so emotional. Yes, it IS another jail movie but it's not like any else you'll ever see. And yes, there is a rape scene but it's a phenomenal movie and it will probably become your new favorite. I can't speak for everyone but it surely did become my new favorite. And I won't give away the ending on you but I can say it is about the best movie ending EVER. It's what officially made it my number 1. Anyway, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this movie. You NEED to see it and I rate this movie ten out of ten no doubt.",10,0,0,22 October 2013
