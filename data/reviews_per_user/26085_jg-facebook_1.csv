Blade Runner 2049," Pretty Vacant
","Waited and purchased on 4k UHD.There's a rumor that there was a 4 hour cut of this film. Perhaps it would be better than this offering.
There were not enough people that K interacted with throughout the film that *could* be the person of interest. Zero obfuscation, zero respect for the audience IQ.My biggest beef though...
Humans are out to kill any nexus 8 or below because... Why?
Start of film, K arrives at a farm and 'Retires' a Nexus 8.
Marvelous. What was accomplished?
A Nexus 8 was living out the remaining years of it's life, isolated, cultivating food for humans.
K had no clue anything else was going on, neither did the humans ordering him about.
K stumbles upon the possibility that a Nexus could reproduce. 
At this point, the only 'person' who could possibly know would be Wallace, with his access to old records.The cartoon 'Blackout', while pretty, is a trend that annoys me immensely.
Because it's proof of a mediocre director.What I see is:
'I can't make a movie that encompasses all the points that make it cohesive, so I relay on the expertise of others to convey the meaning that escapes my efforts to make a film'. But let's market it as something 'For the Fans!'There's a trend in art to deliver sub par dross. The 'artiest' can't let the 'art' to stand on it's own, because it would be seen as being no better than a two year old's crayon drawing stuck to the fridge. To justify the price, said crayon drawings justification comes with a 3000 word dissertation about what it represents, normally involving the current political trends.Like Big Bang Theory pointing out that Indy had zero effect on the outcome, this film feels like everything would be solved in 20 or 30 years because all the older Nexus models would have died and nobody would have been bothered.",2,2,3,5 July 2018
