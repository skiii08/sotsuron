Casablanca," Casablanca - medicine.
","Whenever I'm down, whenever I'm sad and whenever I feel the need to get some assurance from the world in order to pull through. And every time, which is quite often as I work in this business, I sit though a boring, lousy film I put Casablanca in the video. Then I believe in every good thing again. Amazing that this troubled and not very refined production has so much power and spell. Thanks to all the old-timers in front and behind this unique movie.",10,1,1,8 November 2000
Meet the Parents," Trad comedy
","Robert De Niro is more or less a Walther Matthau-character is this comedy and it is surprising, even refreshing that he - as an actor and a co-producer of this film - wants to do a classic screwball-film. Even taxidrivers get older, one must realize. And when they do, they want to entertain on the good old family playground. It is in many ways an old-fashioned film, well acted and nice to relax to. One may not be wiser on the mysteries of neither life nor love after watching it, but some time has been killed in a very humane way.",5,0,0,8 November 2000
