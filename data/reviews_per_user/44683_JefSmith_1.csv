The Blair Witch Project," Not so much scary as unsettling
","I didn't love this film, but I liked it a lot. And while I wasn't really scared by it, I thought it was very unsettling. I liked the jerky camera-work, I liked the acting, and I noticed when it was over that I had really been *paying attention* to the screen.It's been interesting reading viewers' comments, especially from people confused by the ending. One of the things I really admired about the film was how one remark at the beginning set up the ending perfectly, so that when the last scene came up I knew immediately what it meant. Then the credits appeared and a guy in front of me yelled 'What a crock!', but at that point the hair was still standing up on the back of my neck.",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
