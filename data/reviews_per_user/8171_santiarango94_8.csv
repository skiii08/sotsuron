Black Swan," The perfect combination
","The only reason why Black Swan didn't win best picture at the Oscars is, I think, because this is so innovative to filmmaking that it took everyone by surprise. Black Swan is the combination of classic arts like Ballet and the complexity of a character like Nina, which makes the movie take a turn to the psychological thriller. The film takes you to many subplots at a time; all of which surround Nina's odd behavior. I still wonder how could these people imagine so much things coming out of the mind of a dancer, and so I ask myself how could Natalie Portmann make such a good interpretation that, in combination to the background of the scenes makes you feel the mental trauma that this girl has in respect to so many things.Black Swan is so good because it takes ballet, insanity, terror, family, society, love, and bonds it all up in one main plot, which can be said to be the main character's mental struggles.This is a must watch for the first three times for sure. It will always have something to tell, and the understanding will be different each time you watch this again.",9,1,2,25 March 2011
Dog Day Afternoon," A masterpiece as an entertaining thriller
","Dog Day afternoon is simply a superbly organized film. It begins with the fact of being a real story, and that is the strong point of having told the story. After that we begin having something like a comic-thrilling surrounding the film, and you get kept laughing and at the same time expecting for something bad to unfold. What gets better about this part is the fact that you get really in touch with the main character, Sonny (Pacino). The great acting behind this weird character is what lets you know about his part intelligence/part ingenuity.A great historic context is also involved in the film; the left outs of the 60 are also important in the movie, as they will make you laugh and at the same time reflex on the impact of this decade over the Americans.What else can I say...just watch Dog Day Afternoon cause you'll not feel sorry for it.",8,0,0,21 August 2010
The Hurt Locker," The encountered emotions by watching a best picture winner
","As an only 15 year old movie fan, i really appreciate watching Oscar best picture nominees. I found out that the hurt locker was a very different film, it had nice action sequences that i had not seen before on other movies. avatar, its opponent to win the Oscar,may have a more complete end and plot, its high levels of popularity that can be justified by the high costs that this film demanded is nothing similar to THL's. but Avatar lacks of a lot of originality in many of its scenes, something that we cant see in THL. this is were i found the real matter of having THL as winner. From the ten nominees for BP there must be another film such as precious, an education, or inglorious basterds that could win this award. but, taking into account that i haven't even seen the previously mentioned films i can say that if the competition was to be between Cameron and Bigelow there is no way to say that avatar was way too much exceeding THL because we have to remember that academy's best picture doesn't care about special effects, or the money invested on the film. what really matters is how the stories can be innovative, the way in which they can transmit a message. Avatars message is clear and the film is great, but i don't find it so logic that a film that ended as many action films and had such a poor script could be considered far away from the hurt locker, which has a good script.",8,0,3,28 March 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Everything I expect to see on a film
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has become one of my top 5 films. I just bought the special edition DVD and watched this for the fourth time to have the exact same feeling i had when i first saw it. I simply find, that even putting aside its plot (which is by itself very magical) this movie is amazing at every aspect you could try to find: Our two main characters (Brad and Cate) truly show what their greatness in acting is. As I saw on another review, the films tenderness and feeling is brought by its actors, whereas Fincher, who is not so a romantic director, does his best at making the film as complete as possible in every technical and artistic aspect. I looked at all the special features on my DVD and realized how much the compromise of the cast and the crew with making a perfectionist piece of work was. I think that's what i had felt with Benjamin even before watching the special features. This film has become a topic of discussion at home ever since we watched it. Its look at life and it's splendid focus on special effects and artistic representation makes this movie 500% worth watching!15 out of 10",10,0,1,8 June 2014
Jaws," OK Jaws
","I had always thought there was a big hype about this movie,enough to make it a Spielberg classic or to have been considered better than the Cuckoos Nest.Finally I decided to watch this film i thought was crap, and my final conclusion has been that the film is entertaining. I know it has a big misinterpretation of shark's behavior and the plot is too simple but if you give this a chance you will sure like it. Its not that good as a classic but as a nice picture thats now 35 years old.Jaws is just like the other classic-considered films from Spielberg like ET or Indiana Jones, its all about giving them a help to be good.",7,2,3,21 July 2010
Inception," Good!...But not THAT good
","I admit Inception is a very good film. It really explores very deep on dreams and its behavior, i liked very much the sentimental dilemma the movie goes through and the action sequences are believable according to the plot.Even though there is many aspects to highlight on this picture i find it hard that inception is that high on IMDb's top. I think that it's exaggerated rating makes the future viewers too much anxious about the film that they won't get THAT MUCH as to think its is their favourite.Don't get me wrong cause i am not claiming Inception is a bad movie cause I'm not. I just think it deserves a lower rating on the top 250. That will help people feel much more good after they watch the film.",7,4,8,19 August 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Definitely not as good as 8,7
","I watched The Force Awakens just after having watched the previous six right before this one came out. I actually didn't want to go see this one at first, thinking it would probably be just a commercial movie more than an interesting continuation of the saga. It definitely impressed me to see that it got so highly rated on IMDb, and that general comments said it had been a good movie. Even though Ep7 doesn't fail to be a Star Wars saga movie, bringing us to the scenario we had been expecting, I still think it is not as deserving of such hype, and that maybe most of the people have seen it so splendid either because it didn't disappoint them or just because of the fact of having the chance to see again the characters of the first trilogy. More than that, I would say this movie just uses again parts we've seen before in the previous ones, only with new characters.In conclusion, I'm still not sure this is really a movie pretending to strengthen the saga or just a money maker. In any case it does not deserve that much rating.",5,8,15,22 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A total dilemma
","Now, after 33 years of having heard about this movie i finally decided to buy its DVD taking into account its rating on IMDb and its historical success over most of the people. i guess that i am maybe not compatible with this saga, though i new i was going to dislike it even since i was a child. But now, when i finally decided to take the risk to watch this movie what i found out confirmed all what i had thought before. I Found a silly and very overrated film, i couldn't have seen it all if i didn't keep reminding myself that this was an old movie.Star Wars is basically the movie that began a series of clich√©s on movie history; the movie itself contains parts of movies you have seen on TV before, so it is impossible for you to accept that such a great movie turned into a series of low rated movies and series afterwards. its like saying that it is okay for SW because it is old but not for the rest because now new things need to be invented.I can understand how Star Wars could have been the best for people who lived their youth on their 70's (and maybe the majority of IMDb's users are probably from this time), but i cannot understand why it is still now the big deal; enough to be on the 14th place on a tops list.",6,0,4,18 August 2010
