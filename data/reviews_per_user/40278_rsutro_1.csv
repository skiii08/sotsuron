The Legend of Bagger Vance," Backstory
","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Bagger_Vance - mentions how this movie is a reference to the Bhagavad-Gita. Similarities between the Gita and Bagger Vance: Junah = Arjuna Bagger Vance = Bhagavan ...the five horses are Arjuna's five senses = Junah will find his authentic swing when he lets his body and 'all his senses' work together.Also discussed at length by: http://www.awesomestories.com/religion/bagger-vanceI found it it be very well acted and directed.If you haven't seen this I highly recommend it. As a person who has never played golf, but has met many dedicated players, it also gave me more respect for the sport.And during our current U.S. almost-depression, it is a cheering tale.",10,1,3,2 August 2009
