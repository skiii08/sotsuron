The Devil's Advocate," Satan is your ,your boss? UH-OH!
","Keeanu Reeves put on a great performance as an hard-nosed lawyer from Florida in 'The Devil's Advocate'. The beginning of the movie starts off great, where he defends a teacher accused of molestation. I bet he felt real stupid when he sees his client playing his 'instrument'. He should have dismissed him right on the spot! The Lomaxes (Reeves and Charlize Theron) get the opportunity to go to the Big Apple simply because he's the best. There's a hitch, his employer is so shady, not only he will win every court case, his soul is the most important thing he has own. This movie is a little more hardcore than 'The Devil and Daniel Webster' with temptations that are to good to be true. Mary Ann Lomax is starting to dislike being in New York, because the new friends she made, turns out to be more sinister, than Kevin would ever see. The part where the friend took off her bra so she can put on her new dress then Mary Ann rushes out of the store when she saw the demonic look in her. After finding out who his business partner really is, Lomax decides to tempt the devil, himself. It was better to stay and find a new line of work than to enjoy a job opportunity that carried a heavy tag. This movie was very sinister, very entertaining, and very intriguing, I could watch this movie at any time I want. GREAT! 5 STARS!",10,2,2,3 March 2005
The Blair Witch Project," No special effects here!
","'The Blair Witch Project' is a movie within itself. This is really a real live horror movie in the making. Everything in it here is pure and simple. No make up, no extras, no crew, just documentary that's straight forward. It is surprising that a crew doing this project would disappear with a trace. Were the others too frighten to report? Or there's something real sinister about this project? It all took place somewhere in Maryland in 1994, and the film is found a year later. That girl in the video showed real fear. I mean it nearly frightened me too. Many documentaries have their own twists and turns. Some of them are real the rest were made up to fool the viewers. This one was no faker. Great cast to do this re-enactment, and the results is unbelievable. A very good movie! 5 stars!",10,1,3,16 August 2008
The Mask," SSSSSSSSSSSmokin'!!!
","This is one of Jim Carrey's best! Prior to 'Ace Ventura', 'The Mask' is full entertainment. Very cartoony, it makes 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' a class project. All that special effects, all the music, all the laughs who could ask for more? The club scene was the best for me, that's where Cameron Diaz really showed her stuff dancing with Carrey. 'The Mask' is so unbelievable, even the 'Cuban Pete' number was an actual video. That video will make everyone dance. Stanley Ipkiss(Carrey) was the hero of this movie, when Dorian Tyrell(Peter Greene) showed evil when he wore the mask. he even took out other bad guys with that power. Then Milo, Ipkiss' dog uses the mask's power to take on the gang himself. It was a blast! A super hit for Carrey, don't get me wrong, this movie was not a letdown, not one bit! This will be another notch in his belt of hits. Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars!",9,0,0,29 December 2005
Saturday Night Fever," Doesn't matter what it was rated, it's a great movie all the way!
","The 1970's was the decade for John Travolta. He did 'Welcome Back, Kotter', 'Carrie', and now 'Saturday Night Fever'. I can understand Brooklyn, when you're a nobody in the neighborhood, you ought to get noticed. This movie to me is all about life, and the disco is the only place you can think of, right, WRONG! Anybody can strut his stuff of the disco floor, but wait, there's Stephanie. She's learning to live her life the way it is. She tries her best to help Tony(John Travolta) what it's like outside where he comes from. He hangs around his friends and his family who are bound by traditions. I think they are more misguiding than anyone I would know. And conscience played a factor for Tony when the disco dance contest was rigged and he thinks the Spanish couple deserved the 1st place prize. I agreed with him big time. At the end, Tony realized that Stephanie was the real deal and his family and friends were all a big joke to him. Starting over was the goal to Tony and Stephanie. The movie it had a lot of advantages, the music, the cast, and the scene. The cast had a big impact for the stars of today, like Fran Drescher, and Donna Pescow, two years later she did a sitcom called 'Angie'. This movie was a big phenomenon. And it should stay that way for a lifetime. I don't care it was 'R', 'X', or 'PG' rated. It's a hit ALWAYS! RATING 5 STARS!",10,2,6,18 February 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," BETTER THAN THE FIRST!
","Quentin Taratino really outdid himself this time. He really put more detail into the movie unlike the first one. Both movies have a lot of details on what happen to whom. The Viper Squad really went to pieces after 'The Bride' realizes that Budd, Bill's brother lied about selling his katana. And I thought it was cool when Elle lost her right to her master. And Bill warned 'The Bride'. And Elle poisoned the master in the process for the loss of her eye. The movie did tone down the blood violence, but it packed it a lot of detail into every scene. I liked the part when Elle betrayed Budd, with a mamba-lace million dollar luggage in order to find 'The Bride'. Then in the short sword fight, she was blind, indefinitely! It was cool when The Bride squashed Elle's left eye! It was creepy for some, but not to me! At least she fulfilled her prophecy: To KILL BILL! Man, was this movie action-packed or what? I've enjoyed it all. So far it's the biggest keeper of all Quentin Taratino's movies. GO QUENTIN! A BIG 10+!",Null,0,1,27 August 2004
Vertigo," Very Intense!
","This is not bad for a 50's movie. Especially if it's from Alfred Hitchcock. The beginning of the movie didn't look like anything from that era. I mean, the title and the background effects, it looked more scientific to any era. The affects of a phobia always impairs a person's work. And conquering them shouldn't be a problem. But if the person has 'Vertigo', like the main character, conquering the fearing always have drawbacks. Scottie Fergerson(James Stewart) has vertigo and the fear of heights, that effected his work and cost a police officer's life. The guilt haunts him. Midge Woods(Barbara Bel Geddes, before DALLAS), is a designer and painter who seems to be the stronger characters in the movie. I thought is was funny when she painted the picture of the sitter with her likeness in it. For Scottie, he was not amused. SHAME ON YOU, SCOTTIE! However, the obsession made him too obsessed on finding out the mystery woman he's tailing. The woman(Kim Novak) was somehow just a pawn instead of the culprit when Scottie's friend hired him to look out. Guilt followed him again when she jumped off the roof, or so it seemed. The real pawn in the movie was Scottie himself. His own friend took advantage of his condition, and try to make him feel guilty again. Conquering the fear of heights is not easy, only if you let it persist. Like the old saying, The only thing you have to fear its fear itself. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.",9,5,6,8 July 2005
Gremlins," Mischieviously clever!
","This is what I can say is clever, quirky, and very entertaining. 'Gremlins' is by chance a clever and witty movie by Steven Spielberg. This fantasy/horror/comedy is well made and very fun to watch. Having a pet is always a hassle, yet it can be fun. When you have a Mogwai, you're will to pay a high price. A inventor wannabe named Randall Peltzer(Hoyt Axton) is buying a gift for his son Billy(Zach Galligan), the owner's grandson(John Louie) gives Ran the three important rules:1) Never give it water, 2) Keep it out of bright light, 3) Never feed him after midnight. Did Billy abide by the rules? NO! Those cute furry Mogwois become these hideous green gremlins, and they spread terror all over the small town. But somehow, these guys were beneficial in one way, they scared the living daylights out of poor Mrs. Deagle(Polly Holliday, 'Alice', 'Flo', 'Mrs. Doubtfire') she was not well-liked in town. He heart was bad, the gremlins made it go away. HAHAHA! I liked the bar scene where all of them were having fun, and I liked the gremlin with the leg-warmers did all the dancing to Michael Sembello's song. They have one soft spot in the movie, Disney's 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. The movie was entertaining and very funny in the process, my brother's first girlfriend was frightened by this movie, my brother? E.T. You must have guts, watch it. 5 stars!",10,0,3,30 June 2006
The Incredible Hulk," This isn't a sequel, this is an update: HULK LIKES!!
","The first HULK movie was just the beginning. It was a bit on the dark side. The only enemies he had to face were the Hulk-dogs and the Army. 'The Incredible Hulk' is an overall improvement from the first. There was a plot, there was an enemy, there was some action. The cast was great. Edward Norton as the brilliant Dr. Bruce Banner; Liv Tyler as Dr. Elizabeth 'Betty' Ross; William Hurt as General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross; Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky aka 'The Abomination'(A Hulk-wannabe). The CGI graphics were indeed top-notched. Better than Ang Lee's. But if it wasn't for Ang Lee's version 5 years ago, there wouldn't be another movie. So give that guy some credit! The battle scene between the Hulk(Norton) and the Army was classic. Taking out those Hummers, using the crude shields against the fire-power. The New York scene is great: Hulk vs. Abomination. Ilkied the part where the Hulk used the police car as 'boxing gloves'. The Abomination is stronger than the Hulk at first(He can lift 100 tons with ease), but he lacks the rage power. The Hulk's strength is unlimited(100 tons+) so he can kick serious butt with any enemy he faces. Dr. Samuel Sterns is another character to be reckoned with. He'll be known as the villainous Leader. The Hulk got to do more things in this movie: The Thunder Clap, and his trademark words: HULK SMASH!! Whch was voiced by the original, Lou Ferrigno which by chance plays a Security Guard who gets a free medium pizza. This movie is an improvement big time. Liked the cast, the storyline, the honorable mention of Bill Bixby in his earlier work. A younger Jack McGee who was played by the late Jack Colvin. This movie's got some 70's nostalgia there. I just want to Hulk out, and see it again and again. HULK SMASH! This one tops the 2003 version, big time! 5 STARS!",10,2,7,13 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," So this is how it began!
","George Lucas really knows what he's doing. I thought the 'Star Wars' I first saw was the beginning. Now I'm really seeing the real picture on how Anakin Skywalker(Jake Lloyd) became the dreaded Darth Vader. We all know that he's a very skilled pilot, and he befriends Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan MacGregor). And this Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn(Liam Neeson) who is very unique in his fighting skills. Then there's this annoying character I wished I never knew, Jar-Jar Binks(Ahmet Best). This is I want to take a light saber, and cut off his head, then again, he is helpful in ways. Then there's this Sith fighter named Darth Maul(Ray Park). That is one dark fighter. First of all, a dual-bladed light saber, battles Qui-Gon in the desert. Then my favorite light saber battle between Qui-Gon, Obi-Won, and Darth Maul. That scene is the real deal there. Getting to see Yoda, Yaddle, and Mace Windu(Samuel L. Jackson) in the Jedi Counsel makes it more interesting to watch. I have to give it to Lucas, he really outdid himself there. May the force be with you. 5 stars!",10,2,5,16 February 2007
The Expendables 2," Bring it on, BABY! Bring on the firepower and the mayhem. Keep it coming!
","This sequel did not disappoint! Maximum star power, maximum firepower, maximum excitement. 'The Expendables 2' was a thrill ride that no one will ever forget. Sly is back with his crew once more, but this time they gain a new recruit: Bill the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) who's a top notched sniper, and Maggie (Yu Nan) who is smart but very gutsy in nature. They bring back all the ones who just had cameos in the first installment. It got more fun when they got Booker(Chuck Norris) ' The Lone Wolf', and Jean-Claude Van Damme. There's one drawback, he's a villain. The action in the movie was totally non-stop, there was also a lot of humor, clichés, and one liners in the film. So long to list, I can't catch up if I tried. 'I''ll be back!', is a classic. Sly and Van Damme? An unlikely battle in the making, however, it's a new epic battle anyone can think of. Dolph Lundgren was known for his intellectual talent back in the 80's. He really put it into good use here. If you thought the first movie was something, you haven't seen anything like this. 'The Expendables 2' is a must see movie for years to come. All star action, all star humor, and just enough adrenaline to keep you alert at all times. Enjoy this movie! 4.5 out of 5 stars.",9,106,180,18 August 2012
The Longest Yard," This surpasses the original by a touchdown!
","I remember seeing 'The Longest Yard' with Burt Reynolds as the star. Now they got a remake with Adam Sandler, I was a bit hesitant of seeing it. But when I saw the cast, including Burt Reynolds. I said to myself, 'Hey, What the hey?' Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, a gridiron great who gets it when he wrecks the car by letting police cruisers smash into it. That's a far cry from what Burt Reynolds character did to it. He sends it into the water, deep water. The cast and characters are unbelievable. Some SNL alums, and some sports stars to make the movie. Football, wrestling, R&B star Nelly, man can it get any better that this? The scenes are outrageous, I liked the part where this towering prisoner named Turley(Dalip Singh) kicks the burly guy in the helmet and breaks his nose. Then in the football game, Crewe threw the ball at the referee's groin twice. Can't make the call with your friends in pain. HAHA! Then I liked the part where Battle(Bill Goldberg) switched the steroids with estrogen pills. This movie really surpassed the 1974 version, and it's a lot funnier as well. A new classic is in the making. Enjoy it after the Super Bowl! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.",9,1,4,3 June 2006
Ghost," A tear-jerker!
","Life after death can be real experience after passing from the living. It can be a dream or a nightmare when you have lived you life. In 'Ghost', it can be both. A yuppie in New York named Sam Wheat(Patrick Swayze) lives with his sweetheart Molly(Demi Moore) with his life in full motion. Then one night, everything changes. His life is ended with a bullet, and he's wandering the streets of New York confused and scared out of his wits. He does get help with a psychic (Whoopi Goldberg) who happened to be a know con-artist. With her help they make an effort to save Molly from certain doom. Not only Sam's killer is the culprit, but someone from his job is also guilty to his murder: Carl Bruner(Tony Goldwyn), Sam's own friend! How could it be? Somehow, he was the bigger thief than Oda Mae Brown. This movie is strong, uplifting and supportive in every way. Swayze and Moore make a great team, but Goldberg and Swayze are top-notched, that's a fact! If this movie doesn't move you, then you got a problem. 5 stars!",10,4,6,1 September 2008
The Ring," THIS PUT THE 'S' IN SUSPENCE
","This movie will really put you the edge of your seat. 'The Ring' was indeed the biggest thriller of 2002! There were some disturbing scenes when they played the violent tape many people warned about. The closeness of the cousins, the truth about the daughter, and the cause of the misery really made its pact for a great thriller movie. The cast was great, the plot was awesome, no wonder this received such rave reviews. This movie is definitely a keeper in my book and it's highly recommended for the thriller buffs anywhere! 10+ 5 stars!",Null,0,1,22 January 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A fine movie by Steven Spielberg!
","Here's another action film made by Steven Spielberg. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' combines action, adventure, and a sense of wonder for which anyone can remember for years to come. Harrison Ford plays the title character of the movie, Indiana Jones. This modern-day adventurer travels place to place, find valuable and mysterious items, before the bad guys do. He fights villains of all types, he risks everything to get the prize. I liked every scene in this movie. The desert scene where he takes on the swordsmen. I like the scene where he took on the German solider in the truck where he goes from the back leaps out of the cab of the truck holds on to dear life before the hood ornament breaks, then he takes out the guy. The scene where Indie and Marion(Karen Allen) were tied up, and the Nazis would try see the wonders of the Ark. One of the soldiers shrivels like a raisin, the doctor went like candle wax. These men were only greedy, and greed will get you nowhere, fast! It's a very good movie, and the special effects were amazing. A fun to watch movie it is!5 Stars!",10,0,1,6 August 2007
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Neat, yet subtle
","Though this series of Resident Evil did not hit the theaters, it's still watchable by all means. Umbrella is at it again with their schemes. The place called Arcadia was supposed to be a safe haven turned out to be a trap by Umbrella. Alice (Milla Jovovich) first takes on Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who would later rob her of her powers, and later crash land and find an amnesiac Claire (Ali Larter). The duo would later go to Los Angeles, ravaged. And would land in prison. With no guards, or inmates they and other survivors try their best to survive against the undead. One of them is a director would betray the bunch and head out to Arcadia: A large cargo ship which happens to be a front for Umbrella. In that ship, they would find survivors who ended up to be guinea pigs. Despite being neutralized by Wesker, Alice can still pack a punch. No one can really bring her down. This movie still can be hit, and not all sequels should be shown in the theaters. The action was not lost one single bit. Very subtle though, which kind of makes it home viewing wise. I didn't find anything wrong with film. 2.5 out of 5 stars",6,2,3,15 September 2012
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Endearing!
","Knowing to me this is like the G-rated version of the X-Files. But this has a lot of heart. You got a young boy named Elliot(Henry Thomas) who goes out on a quest with the others. Then one night, he throws a ball out into the shed, and he's freaked. Later out in the field, he's sees a strange creature shrieking at him. That creature was an alien botanist who is simply known as E.T. That same night E.T. retrieves the Reese's Pieces Candy that was left on the ground earlier. The government where on the trail of E.T., one of them finds the candy and samples it. Keeping E.T. from the government is one thing, keeping it from the mom is another. The older brother and sister Gertie(Drew Barrymore) both meet the creature and reacted the same way Elliot did. Now all three have met it, they take equal actions for its well being. With all the fun they have, one will learn after the other. E.T.: ELLIOT, E.T. PHONE HOME, and OUCH. I bet each one have their own talent as well. There was plenty of everything, drama, comedy, love, and intrigue. The ending was a tear-jerker, but who says it had to end on a sad note? Not me. This movie here is really fun for the whole family, and for all ages. 5 Stars!",10,2,4,9 November 2006
It," A whole new level of Stephen King horror
","I've seen the first 'It' film which was a miniseries. It has a great story, great background, and a great plot. This version of the Stephen King novel takes it to a whole new level of horror.
Pennywise the Clown(Bill Skarsgard) comes to the town of Derry, Maine, entertaining the people, and more....
He lures the children with its charm. 'IT' feeds on the children. One victim is Georgie, baby brother of Bill, who is a stutterer. When Georgia went out to play with his paper boat, it sails into the sewer where he first encounter Pennywise. It would be Georgie's last as well. 
Bill and 6 other friends would have common things: Being accosted by bullies, and Pennywise terrorizing them. 
Unlike the 1990 version, there were scenes that went a whole new level like the lake scene. Memorable indeed. They may have been the 'Loser Club', but when it comes to personal demons, the are winners. 
Graphic by all means, it what makes the movie good. 
I don't care what others say, I enjoyed it very well.

Star Trek," What Roddenberry started, J.J. Abrams finished!!
","'Space... The final frontier....' An oldie but goodie has been brought back by 'Fringe' creator, J.J. Abrams. 'Star Trek' created by the genius himself, Gene Roddenberry(1921-91) gets a reprise after all the other movies and past TV shows(some of the were done after Roddenberry's death). This movie goes to the origins of the first adventure of USS ENTERPRISE. You got James Tiberius Kirk(Chris Pine), a cocky trouble-making with the taste for a thrill. After he was born, he gets some reprieve to join the Federation by a Captain Pike(Bruce Greenwood) who remembers George Kirk for his bravery against the Romulans. He meets Ulhura(Zoe Saldona) at a bar, gets a shot to be in the Federation following the brawl. On planet Vulcan, there's is Spock, who is a half-breed gets to do the same thing; join the Federation. Nero(Eric Bana), is a nutshell. Blaming Spock for the destruction of his planet, he destroys Vulcan for his troubles. Getting all the crew to battle him took lots of determination and a little bit of logic from The Future Spock(Leonard Nimoy) which helps prevent an uncertain future. Just not seeing this movie, is totally illogical. Plenty of plot enough energy to keep you on the edge of your seats. With a touch of humor 'Star Trek' will time warp you to galaxies far away. What Roddenberry started, Abrams finished. I liked the interactions of Kirk and the green woman,also with Ulhura and Spock. That is mind-bending there. Live long and prosper- Spock 5 stars!!",10,4,17,9 May 2009
Underworld," BLOOD SUCKERS VS. LYCANTHROPES, NOW HERE'S A BATTLE!
","The ultimate battle of the creatures of the night is ready to start. Here on one side are the vampires, on the other side are the werewolves(Lycanthropes). Man it doesn't get any better than this. I've enjoyed this movie straight through. Selene(Kate Beckinsale) was not only the fierce soldier, but a beautiful blood sucker as well. Selene was not your typical vampire, she adamant and persistent on know the truth about Lucian. I like the fully automatic 9mms she carried. It made her effficiently dangerous against the Lycans. Michael(Scott Speedman) had to trust Selene when his co-worker was less than helpful with his dilemma. At least he has the best or worst of both worlds. For Selene knowing the truth had a price, but it was worth it. I've enjoyed the movie very well, and the the ending also proves there be more to come: It's just the beginning!

Kickboxer," Van Damme really kicks butt!
","This movie 'Kickboxer', gives it name out well. Jean-Claude Van Damme showed his true feelings in this movie. Danny Alexio and him play the Sloan brothers who go to Thailand to compete in a kick-boxing. However, Eric Sloan(Alexio) is facing a lethal opponent. His name, Tong Po! The way he kicks that column, shows hardcore training. When Eric faces Tong Po, he is crippled by his blows. His brother Kurt(Van Damme) goes off, and wants serious revenge. Knowing that his fighting skills aren't enough to take on Tong Po, he gets help from a friend who's a war veteran(Haskell V. Anderson, III) finds a trainer named Xian(Dennis Chan). Knowning about the news of his brother, Kurt goes through some rigorous training. Then I like the part where Xian gets him loaded, and make him dance, then while loaded, he takes on some of the fighters of Freddy Li(Steve Lee). That was funny when Xian told the fighters that 'their mothers had sex with mules'. He really gets vengeful when Tong Po raped Mylee(Rochelle Ashana). So there are two people to avenge. The fight scene was classic; broken glass, resin, and hemp gloves. Kurt really went medieval on Tong Po, hence the old saying, 'The gloves are coming off!' The kicks are very skilled, and choreography is outstanding. I enjoyed this movie very well! 4 out of 5 stars!",9,0,0,20 January 2007
Star Trek Into Darkness," To boldly go where no movie goer has gone before!
","For all the Star Trek fans, the sequel to the 2009 hit has come! Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock(Zachary Quinto), Ulhura (Zoe Saldana), and the rest of crew have come back to tackle another threat that has come to mind. The ever maverick Kirk, goes to a foreign planet that is so primitive, he lets his crew get discovered. That violation gets him demoted and sent to Starfleet. But a bombing in London gets him back to the Enterprise after the terrorist kills Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood). The terrorist is Commander John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who is later known as Khan! Khan is a superhuman being who is genetically enhanced to withstand the harsh atmostsphere was released by Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller, 'RoboCop') who is responsible for the mess. His daughter Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) who helped out Kirk and the Enterprise crew. The photon torpedo that Dr. Marcus and McCoy find didn't have special ammunition, but are used to hold the cryonically placed beings of Khan's people. And the rogue Admiral was responsible for this. Kirk and Spock have been put through the test, and they have return the favors from each mission. Very logical to say the least. This movie was high impact, high quality, and high action. Got to see what the Klingons look like in this version. And it kind of close to the 1980's version of Part II & Part III. This is a real improvement from the first one. It's a must see, 5 stars!",10,15,37,18 May 2013
Happy Gilmore," Barker vs. Gilmore: That's what made it great!
","This is one Adam Sandler movie that'll go down in the history books. He plays a ex-hockey player whose slap shot makes him a golf pro. I mean he's no Tiger Woods, but with a few lessons he'll be good. Happy Gilmore(Adam Sandler) would be playing pro-hockey, since he couldn't skate, his swing was the strong point of it all. I mean, if a person could swing, doesn't make him useless. Since Gilmore's skating handicapped him from the dream sport, golf club shaped like a hockey stick keeps him from being disillusioned. Chubbs Peterson(Carl Weathers, 'Action Jackson', 'Predator', and The 'Rocky' Movies) is Happy's mentor. A football player-turned actor lost his hand to an alligator. Happy did get his revenge on the alligator, but his payback claims Chubbs' life as well. Then my favorite scene of all time is 'The Price is Right' host Bob Barker battling Gilmore in a brawl, which I think is outstanding, and hilarious as well. This movie is what Barker calls is his 'revenge' since he took karate lessons from Chuck Norris. WHAT A PAYOFF! That's one game-show host I wouldn't p--- off! All the way, this movie rocks. See it for yourself. Being a 'Price is Right' fan, I wouldn't miss it for the world. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",8,3,5,17 February 2006
Spice World," NOT MUCH OF A MOVIE, MORE LIKE AN DOCU/MOCUMENATRY OF SOME SORT
","Fans of The Spice Girls would like this movie. A few fictional characters along with the real deal in tow. I say chap, the music in the movie is what really got the groove on. It was funny when all the girls screamed at the bomb on the bus. They played all the hits, which was good.The plans were thwarted as usual, the Girls never missed a beat throughout the movie. Too bad they've could've improved the plot a little bit, it would've been a big hit.

Batman Returns," This one is much darker!
","The sequel to the 1989 hit has come. This time, he takes on two villains: The Penguin(Danny DeVito) aka Oswald Cobblepot and the Catwoman(Michelle Pfieffer) aka Selina Kyle. These two would have made the perfect team. However, Catwoman has her own agenda, and The Penguin teams with a dirty businessman named Max Shreck(Christopher Walken). This man is worse than Carl Grissom who was killed by the Joker. The duo first scheme is to smear the Dark Knight. Second, is for the Mayor to be recalled. The plan worked, unfortunately the partnership of Penguin and Catwoman was short lived. And Batman had to reveal the Pengiun's true nature at a conference. And the cheers turn into jeers. The action was great with the Batmobile when it becomes the Batmissle. And the suit of Batman's is sharp. The movie was great, but the plot could have more depth to it. It was a bit hollow, and it was very much darker than the first one. Still a good movie though. 3 out of 5 stars!",8,0,0,11 May 2008
Blade," THE ULTIMATE VAMPIRE KILLER!
","Who could play the role of Marvel's greatest heroes better than Wesley Snipes? NO ONE! He has put the 'A' in action when it comes to fighting vampires. Blade, the vampyre(half-breed) who hunts the undead, and protects the human race. That's what unusual to anyone who doesn't read Marvel comics. Snipes fighting abilities came in very handy for this role. Very swift,stoic, aloof, silent, and quick. No one crosses this superhero. Kris Kristofferson did a great job playing the role of Whistler. Stoic, wise, and aware of the undead and their weaknesses. As dangerous as it is outside, vampires are the threat to society. But with Blade, everything is safe.

X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Talk about slicing and dicing!
","*SNIKT!* This feral mutant gets his own movie, how neat! Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) aka James Howlett, aka Logan gets to know more about himself in this movie. Born in the 1800's, this mutant has the claws to tear through his enemies like a hot knife through butter. He gets to join the armed forces with his 'brother' Victor Creed(Liev Schrieber), aka 'Sabertooth'. These berserkers have fought side-by side and against each other. I liked the part where Wolverine gets his bones laced with the ultra-hard metal called Adamantium. It makes his bones ultra-durable and his claws ultra-deadly. The other characters were great: Wade Wilson aka 'Deadpool'(Ryan Reynolds), Fred J. Dukes aka 'The Blob'(Kevin Durand), and several others in there too long long to remember. Berserker barrages, feral impulses gives the movie an edge that the other ones didn't have, and since the movie is based on Logan's questionable past, knowing who's who is a mystery to anyone. Gambit(Taylor Kitsch) is just a s resourceful as Kayla Silverfox was. His kinetic cards has plenty of impact to the situation. This movie has plenty to go on; plot, humor, action, and intrigue. I enjoyed the movie very well. If you don't like it, you'll be dealing with Wolverine, BUB! *SNIKT!* 4.5 out of 5 stars!",9,10,21,1 May 2009
That Thing You Do!," One hit wonders are always memorable!
","One hit wonders are always common in music. The cause of that, not enough ideas, next song doesn't click, strife in the business, stress of traveling, etc. You name it, it's there. 'That Thing That You Do!' is a marvel of a movie about a fictional boy band in the 1960's who get their big break with the help of a determined manager named Mr. White(Tom Hanks). They are know to the U.S. as The Wonders(Oneders) The band get their show on the road when Guy Patterson(Tom Everett Scott) becomes the new drummer after the original breaks his arm. They go places to perform, and Guy meets jazz drummer Del Paxton(Bill Cobbs) who warns him about bands and success. He did take heed. After the performance of a variety show, the band starts to suffer. Egos clash, and head-butting with other members split the band. Some of the members form a new band, Guy and Del start to make music of a different tone, choosing Jazz over Rock-n Roll. What started with a band, ended with a new opportunity. Hanks did a great job making this movie, Liv Tyler did a spectacular performance playing Faye Dolan. She was important to Guy, and Lamarr(Obba Babatunde) was a very resourceful and wise bellhop. Don't forget Tom Hank's 'Bossom Buddies' co-star Peter Scolari. Great movie, what more could I say? 4 out of 5 stars!",9,1,2,31 October 2007
Constantine," Graphic? YES! ,Entertaining? Yes! ,A drag?NO!
","An installment of a graphic comic book has come on to the big screen. 'Constantine' is indeed a very violent and very graphic movie. All those demons, all the gore, and the depicted scenes of Hell, makes DOOM look like a cheap advertisement. I liked the way it way made, despite of what I saw, Keanu Reeves played the character down hard. Known in 'The Matrix' movies as Neo, John Constantine is a heavy smoking demon killer who put them critters back where they belong. Since Heaven doesn't want him, and Hell doesn't either, he's stuck on Earth. The gun was outrageously ingenious. No demon should mess with Constantine. Going after the half-breeds are always a pain, and Satan was always getting his mitts on Constantine. Since he couldn't get him, he got his cancers instead. This movie is more entertaining than most demon based movies. I liked the part where Gabriel(Tilda Swifton), lost his wings. And mostly his godliness. A very fun film for the fans of Vertigo Comics.

Orphan," Looks can be very deceiving!
","When I saw this movie, adopting can be scary, or even dangerous. Here you have a couple in Conneticut who were trying to have a third child into their family. The results: A Stillborn. The parents grieve their loss, and they move on. They try to adopt, and they did. They go to the Orpahnage for little girls and they come across Esther. This girl claims to be from Russia, and is very smart for her age. She is very artistic for her age as well. But she is hiding a secret that doesn't come out until she has settled into the Colemans. She befriends their deaf daughter Max, freaks out her big brother, and the rest of the schoolmates began to taunt her. One girl gets her ankle broken, the brother nearly loses his life to Esther. Esther is a really BAD GIRL! More and more secrets are coming out: she is psychotic, manipulative, and deceiving. Esther is not even 9, she's a 33 year-old, with a violent streak, and a disorder which gives her that youthful appearance. That is really scary! This movie is a cross between 'The Omen' and 'The Crush', and the cast and characters are played out very well. A real keeper! 4 out of 5 stars!",9,2,3,25 June 2010

Resident Evil: Extinction," Here it comes....
","After the second Resident Evil movie, I would figure a next one is up. Looks like the Umbrella Corporation is up to its old tricks again. This time thy are trying to make an army by using the undead to their advantage. But what do they use? Blood from Alice( Milla Jovovich) since she has immunity from the dreaded T-Virus that makes the dead be less than dead. Now there are some survivors from the last battle who are in a convoy trying to avoid not only the undead, but the Umbrella as well. When they meet Alice from the infected crow attack, they are more than ready to take down the Umbrella and the undead. When one of the Umbrella members tried to use Alice's blood to his advantage, his arrogance really showed. He wears Alice down temporary, he forgets her allies. Especially when he was in that lethal trap from the first Resident Evil movie. Saying that 'I'm Invincible' is one thing, but in that room, you're just a cut up for laughs. I mean literally. Plenty of horror and gore to say the least, Milla puts the 'A' in action. Enjoyed it very well. 2.5 out of 5 stars",7,1,1,13 September 2012
The Terminator," A Schwarzenegger classic!
","Arnold Schwarzenegger has made an impact on the big screen. First, there was the first two 'Conan' movies, now here's one that will be a true classic of his, 'The Terminator'. The Terminator is a stoic killing machine that its purpose is to 'terminate' its target. This cyborg, is very determined and nothing can stop him. Until one man from the future named Reese(Michael Biehn) who went after the cyborg to stop him. The Terminator seems to be more ruthless than any criminal of any class. After he gets the weapons of choice, he kills the shop owner. Why would he kill the owner when he's only target is Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton). However, The Terminator got to a few wrong Sarah Connors. The first one, was a mother one bullet to the head was bad enough, did he have to totally ambush her? The action is so non-stop there, the gunshots, the car chases, and the plots keeps getting better by the minute. I liked the scene where the truck get taken and Reese takes out the truck with the bomb. I've enjoyed this movie straight out, there's so much to say about it, but I'll just let you see it for yourself. 5 Stars",10,2,3,7 December 2006
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," The greatest Western I ever saw!
","This Western is for real! 'Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid' were one of the toughest outlaws in the West, yet they made their mark in history. Butch(Paul Newman) and Sundance(Robert Redford) new the tricks of the trade on robbery. He and his gang would rob the Union Pacific RR and other banks just to get their kicks. I liked the part where the gang would have Harvey Logan(Ted Cassidy, Lurch on the 'The Addams Family', and the Narrator of 'The Incredible Hulk') be in charge of the robberies. Butch and the Kid wouldn't allow it. So they fight about it and Logan is put down fast. Then there's Etta Place(Katherine Ross, 'The Graduate') who woos both the Kid and Butch. I like the bicycle scene where the song 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head'. That scene would be mimicked in 'The Great Muppet Caper' Yes these two would go all the way in robbing banks, but when the price goes up, they reroute to Bolivia. Ever since they been east, the trio had plenty of fun without robbing a bank in that area. Yep, they went down in Bolivia, or did they? I heard resources that they survived the attack despite the wounds. But who's to say? This is a true story, despite a few changes I liked it though. The gun shooting duo of Butch and Sundance lives on in history. 5 stars!",10,1,3,28 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Final Chapter of the Star Wars saga!
","This is it! The final chapter of the George Lucas series of 'Star Wars'. Return of the Jedi is the movie that ends all drama for Star Wars fans. The characters in this movie gets bigger; I remember Jabba The Hutt from the 4th installment, then there's The Ewoks of Endor. Lando Calrissian(Billy Dee Williams) went from Bespin outcast, into a General for the Rebels to fight against the Empire. The Rancor monster in Jabba's pit was very fierce. And Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher) was elegant in that metallic bikini when she was the slave of Jabba. Of course, she made him limp and lifeless when Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill) jumps into action. The final showdown between Darth and Luke is a classic. Luke shows he is much stronger than his father when he became a Jedi. He didn't give in to the Dark Side of the Force. After Darth tossed the Emperor down the shaft, he became Anakin again; wounded, humbled, and redeemed. Seeing Luke with his own eyes was the sign of redemption and the facts are revealed. That part was a little sad that Anakin died, but he was with the Force again, and he joins the other Jedis. I would rather be a Jedi than a Sith, any day! The remastered version will always be a bigger keeper. See all 6 movies, and it's priceless. May the force be with you! 5 Stars!",10,0,2,17 March 2007
The Expendables," Bring out the Superstars!
","This movie is a real man's movie! You got all the action, all the power, and everything else in between. You gotta have some humor to get along with, otherwise this movie would be boring. Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Terry Crews are the powerhouses of the team. Elite mercenaries who do dangerous missions and get paid for it. However, there was a member of the team who gets careless and ends up messing up. Whoever it was, I'm not saying. The action is nonstop, and there are some scenes that closely like some of Sly's earlier movies. The street scene resembles the 1986 movie 'Cobra'. He has another souped up classic Ford truck. Lundgren and Stallone starred in 'Rocky IV'. I guess you can call it a small reunion together. Well, it's true! This movie also stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis in small, minute roles. The storyline is unbelievable, the action as well. The Expendables will leave you on the edge of your seat! 3.5 out of 5 stars!",8,3,7,18 August 2012
MASH," Who says wartime is gloomy?
","MASH stands for (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) they are helpful when one of their own soldiers is wounded from battle. Do these surgeons worry? If you have one name Captain Hawkeye Pierce (Donald Sutherland) and 'Trapper' John McIntyre(Elliott Gould). These Army surgeons know how to make negative situation like the Korean War, look like another day in paradise. Wars can depress any person involved. But Hawkeye and Trapper uses their shenanigans to bolster up their egos. It works. However, those antics annoy a certain 'deadpan' named Frank Burns(Robert Duvall). This Major is a 'pain', but Hawkeye always has his number. Another soldier named Major Margaret 'Hot Lips' Houlihan(Sally Kellerman) is appalled by Pierce's quips. The worst things that have happened to Burns and Houlihan is when their intimacy is heard throughout the camp. Then when Hot Lips was taking a shower, the shower tent collapsed, and the whole crew get a great look at her! This movie is such a hoot! Dark comedy is unusual to say the least. There's plenty of laughs. Certain themes are questionable, but I don't think that it will bother me. If it haven't been for the movie, there wouldn't be a successful TV show. Only Gary Burgoff remain the true character of the movie, 'Radar'. A war classic that doesn't mean it's a tearjerker. The only tears you have is for 'laughing too hard'. It's worth my while. 5 stars!",10,1,2,30 April 2016
Final Destination 2," Picks up where we left off
","This movie picks up where the last movie left off. I'm surprised that Alex was killed off in part 2. A falling brick? From where? And Clear Rivers(Ali Lauter) institutionalized herself after Alex's death. And the aborted traffic fatality for Kimberly(AJ Cook) took a whole new meaning for this movie. The one year anniversary of the 180 crash, started a whole new phenomena for different people. There's were other survivors that the first movie never mentioned. And the events from the first movie plays a role in the sequel which gives the term a whole new meaning. Eugene Dix(T.C. Carson of 'Living Single' and Living Large') was almost like Carter from the first FD. And the junkie in the Mustang prepared himself perfectly when the explosion occurred. It was gruesome when the traffic accident first occurred when the log truck knocked the trooper's head off. And all the other pileups follow through. A whole new story, the same old consequences, is there a possibility for a FD3? We shall see about that. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",8,0,0,5 May 2005
Blade II," More action there than the first!
","The first Blade movie wasn't bad, this sequel has more to it. Blade(Wesley Snipes) is back again. Only this time he gets to team with the enemy to take on a more dangerous enemy that the other vampires couldn't take out. A group of more elite vampires require the help of Blade, and they help take out vampires that can't be defeat the same way. These vampires are parasites. They make regular bloodsuckers look like mosquitoes. At first, Blade had to recuse his mentor, Whistler(Kris Kristofferson). Those two have been tight for years. Somewhere in the long-run, there were some traces of distrust. The real turncoats was Whistler's replacement who was attacked by some female vampires. One of the elites(Ron Perlman) who had the explosive to his head set by Blade. The only elite vampire was loyal to Blade and not to her family. Knowing to trust only Blade, she died passionately to him. The fight scene are remarkable, the plot is fascinating. No problems whatsoever. I liked it! 3 stars!",8,0,2,16 February 2009
Taxi Driver," Disturbing, yet very interesting!
","Robert DeNiro has made a name for himself in this movie. Yes, I used to be a 'Taxi Driver' myself, but not in New York. A nighttime cabbie can have his good days, and his bad. For Travis Bickle(DeNiro), it can be both. This loner does his usual routine, goes to work, watch a little porn when he not working, or get to rest. When he meets Betsy(Cybill Shepherd), things change for him. Well, maybe. I one of his rounds, he meets a young prostitute named Iris Steensma(Jodie Foster). She from another state, and Travis decides to take action and get her on the straight and narrow. He does that when he encounters that brutal john. Travis now becomes totally unhinged, and Betsy is frightened of him. Then there's that memorable line that no one will ever forget, 'You're Talking to Me?' Although he does not consider himself a hero when he killed that john and get Iris head in place. He should accept the fact that he is one, and he got Betsy, and made the street a little safer without that john. Well, what can you say? The movie did describe myself in that position when I was a cab driver. At least I was nothing like Travis! 5 stars!",10,0,0,19 November 2006
Full Metal Jacket," Hardcore Marine Action, OORAH!
","Stanley Kubrick has put up another fine masterpiece about the USMC getting reading for the Vietnam War. 'Full Metal Jacket' shows how Marine life is not child's play, and the Drill Seargant from Hell(R. Lee Ermey, aka 'The Gunny') really performed well in this movie. It is set in Parris Island, S.C., were the main Corp was locate to whip these civilians into shape. Gunnery Sgt. Hartman(Ermey) is one heck of a bad-a$$ Drill Sgt. who takes no crap from anyone. He didn't discriminate anyone, he treated everyone like an equal. However, he tortured Pvt. Pyle(Vincent D'Onofrio) so bad, he went over the edge after the training. He marched with his pants down, sucked on his thumb like a little boy, and had to endure a very brutal beating from the other Privates. Socking a drill Sergeant will call for a discharge or time in confinement, shooting him will result in court martial, and a dishonorable discharge. Of course, Pyle discharged himself with the same gun. The other went on and the brutal battle is ensured. The Marines don't play around, and they really show the sign of brotherhood of the Corp. The chants the Gunny made was a classic. 'This is my rifle, this is my gun...' is the one song I think should be shared to only the military. It's always lock and load. This movie is a must for all members of the USMC. Whether they are recruits or vets, I this this movie a major SEMPER FI! CARRY ON! 5 STARS, OORAH!",10,9,16,10 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This One got more action to me!
","The second installment of Star Wars is indeed more detailed of knowing more about the saga. Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christensen) is growing up to be a fine Jedi warrior, but he starting delve slowly into the Dark Side; getting reckless, arrogant, and temperamental. With his mentor Obi-Wan(Ewan MacGregor) in tow, he would keep it actions in check. I liked the part where Anakin took out those poisonous creatures before they could kill Senator Padme(Natalie Portman). Of course, Padme can hold her end in the bargain when she fights along the clone troopers and Jedis. Mace Windu(Samuel L. Jackson) showed some action when he and his Jedi Knights took out all those droids. And that Count Dooku(Christopher Lee), boy was he a creepy character. My favorite color light saber would be green, all the way! Samuel L. Jackson's character got a purple one, meaning he's the lead Jedi. And Natalie Portman showed her sexual side when the creature attacked her. Padme is a real leader when she leads those Clone troopers into battle. Yoda really can fight! Taking on Count Dooku, man can he fly! This movie really has intensity there, no doubt about it. I enjoyed it very well! 5 stars!",10,1,3,22 February 2007
Forrest Gump," Through the eyes of a simple-minded man...
","This is absolutely the best movie Tom Hanks has ever played. Here's a man who low of intelligence, but high on life himself. He may have been simple, but he wasn't narrow-minded which was the bright spot for 'Forrest Gump'. The three important people in his life come and gone: Jenny, Forrest's friend from school, Bubba, an army buddy who lost his life during the war, and his mom, a big impact to him. This movie had a big cast, and the scenes are unforgettable. From the running scene which Jenny shouts: 'Run Forrest, RUN!' To the all-girls college dorm room scene which I always shudder at. Forrest Gump may not have had a lot of smarts, but he made a lot of difference to himself which he care less to take notice of.This move is a true classic.

So when they go out into the jungle, each soldier have their own weapons: Blaine(Jesse Ventura, WWE wrestling legend) has the Gatlin gun, Billy(Sonny Landham, '48 Hours') has the M-16 w/shotgun, and others go to the Central America jungle who take out the renegade army, but encounter something more deadly, The Predator! After Mac(Bill Duke) caught and kills a scorpion, why would the Predator be curious about a dead scorpion? Then after every commando are picked one-by-one, Dutch does his best to outmaneuver this sneaky alien killer. To me, this killer makes all other snipers, look like complete amateurs.

American Pie," The Funniest thing since Porky's!
","This is one of the corniest movie I've ever seen since Porky's. Unlike Porky's, this movie is more up-to-date. Making a pact before graduation is usually common among high-school seniors. This was no problem for because I didn't have to worry about something silly about all this. Jason Biggs playing Jim really did his all when his character wants to get a girl, but his reluctance is crippling him really bad. Shannon Elizabeth is H.O.T. as Nadia. When she undresses in front of the web-cam, every guy in the theater will start drooling. Natasha Lyonne(The Slums of Beverly Hills) plays Jessica, the non-stop talking flute player. Alyson Hannigan(The TV version of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer') got into a really raw detail when she tells about the accident where her flute was stuck in her (AHEM!) That's graphic enough for me. The memorable part in the pie, Jim making out with cherry pie, no wonder food and sex is such a hot topic! HAHAHA! This movie is unbelievable, if you like Porky's this movie is a must!

The good part of the movie is when that Danny gets the Greased Lightning to run, and the crew put on the show about it. It's a winner!The really good part is the music. Everyone was really put it on. With so many stars, and very cool music numbers, no wonder this movie was such a sensation. As The Four Seasons have said it best, 'Grease IS the word!'

","Back in the 1970's, there was a movie with the same title. Now they have the same movie, same title, different type of intensity. 'The Hills Have Eyes' is a movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat. A family going to California for vacation would have to take the scenic route. Who would know it would end up being a tourist trap? No one when some spike strips used in highway pursuits would totally disable the family SUV. In the original version the vehicle was a station wagon. That there's an upgrade. That one has a history. A history anyone would should forget. Mutant outcasts spreading terror after a nuclear blast years ago. Man, these people got a serious grudge. Not only did they take out the father, mother, in-law, and brutally assaulting the sister, it's up to the men of the group to fight back. Doug, who hated guns puts his ideologies behind him fast to get his daughter back from those fiendish beings. However, only one of them mutants was helpful with the victims, and rebelled against them. That freakish one with the strength and ax was a challenge. And the brother of the sister was mad enough to avenge the death of his dog. Very bloody, and very intensifying, 'The Hills Have Eyes' is a keeper. So either way you go, 1977 or 2006, it very scary and not for the weak! Rating 3 out of 5 stars!",8,2,3,19 May 2007

Her weakness is magnets, and the T-1000's is cold. Wonder what's the next assassin's weakness is? Microwaves? UV rays? Whatever it is this movie is something else. Despite the huge changes: No Sarah Connor, Warner Bros. making it instead of MGM, several different people in the cast as well. But who cares, they still have Schwarzenegger. That's what matters to me. This movie packed a lot of action, a lot of suspense, and a lot of entrigue. The cemetery scene was great, knowing the year Sarah Connor died. The weapons she left behind, and The Terminator carrying the coffin while fending of the cops and the T-X. I don't how the T-X did it with the cleavage enhancement, but that will cost me my life if I asked her. HAHA!

"I, Robot"," This isn't The Jetsons, yet I like the way the Future looks
","This is one scifi movie I can add to the book. If Issac Asimov was still around, he would've been happy. I like the way the movie was portrayed and the special effects were amazing. For a man who hates robots, he needs to look on the bright side of things robots can do in everyday life. Investigating a doctor's death is always common, when it come to a robot named Sonny, Spooner(Will Smith) seems to have all his suspicions on him. On the other hand, I liked all the vehicles made for the future and the setup there. The robots are always helpful to mankind, despite of Spooner's hatred of robots. When the outdated robots were attacked by the updates. His hatred of robots began to cease. Spooner's hatred of robots was only the test of the updated ones who try to enslave mankind. Dr. Calvin(Bridget Moynahan) finds Spooner's actions illogical, until she finds out the hard way when her personal robot try to imprison her. After realizing he was targeting the wrong robot, Spooner went to the true source, VIKI! This movie is like T2, meets 'The Matrix', meets 'Short Circuit'. There's a lot of adventure and a lot of scifi action as well. If you like the book, you will love the movie as well. Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars.",8,0,1,27 September 2005
American Beauty," Well made, excellent movie
","1999 would be known for the year of great movies. 'American Beauty' really puts the 'd' in dysfunction. This movie dealt with a lot of egotism in everyone's lives. Kevin Spacey really played his role well enough to get an Oscar. Being an unhappy yutz is one thing, but living the life he now would be murder(hence the fact). Spacey will make magic in just about any movie he makes. 'The Negotiator' was suspenseful when learns the truth about his superiors. In the movie here, learns how to regain his 'lost youth' at a time of crisis. Thora Birch was really awesome playing a daughter who downright insecure, and is spooked by the next door neighbor with a camera watching her every move. The most intriguing part of the movie is when she really came out of her 'shell' to the neighbor. BOLD MOVE, but I'm not going too far with that detail, NO WAY! I've enjoyed every inch of that movie, and it's a perfect 10 in my book!",10,0,0,11 March 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," He said, 'I'll Be Back', and he did!

This time, The T-800(Arnold Schwarzenegger) is here on a different mission; to protect Sarah and her son John(Edward Furlong) from a highly advanced terminator, known as the T-1000(Robert Patrick). This terminator is so elusive and so lethal, ingenuity is the main factor in order to stop it. Like the T-800, the T-1000 can't be stopped by bullets. The T-1000 kills John's foster parents. How did he kill the foster mother? I don't wanna know. Sarah's distrust in the terminator was easy to spot, when this tries to help, she was left with no choice but to trust him. And she did. When he stitched her up, her trust in it grew. And the battle scenes between the cops and the terminator was no contest. Not one police officer was killed. The way the could stop the T-1000 was obvious, liquid nitrogen and explosives. Even though, he couldn't self terminate, he had to be destroyed with the same liquid metal that did the T-1000. Simply because, regular ammunition would be a total waste. And furthermore, other super-geniuses could reconstruct it. So he went down, honorably! This movie has more action than the first, and it's a bigger keeper as well. Watch it, and live it! 5 stars!",10,3,4,10 December 2006
Face_Off," More like 'MASS/CONFUSION' to me!
","This movie was indeed loaded with action! John Travolta and Nicholas Cage have packed this movie with a punch! Two men swapping ID's causing hysteria and mayhem, that something you normally don't see in a plot. Using masks is one thing but using one face is very creepy for me. I've heard of getting under someone's skin, but thus is overdoing it. One doesn't like the face and wants to burn it. The other thought it would be fun wearing his face. 'OOOOH WEEEE, you're good lookin'! NOT!' Going undercover has never been so easy, except when you have to use another man's facial feature for the game. Knowing who's who is a big thing here only an expert should watch this movie. To me, this movie is definitely a keeper in the action section. I would definitely call this movie MASS/CONFUSION! Because you can get it if you don't watch this movie carefully!! Rating 4 out 5 stars!",9,0,0,1 May 2003
Spider-Man," Lots of fun!
","More and more Marvel comics characters are coming on the big screen. 'Spiderman' was worth the watch. I pretty much know the story of the origin of the hero. Bitten by a radioactive spider, got agility, and strength of the arachnid. Can climb the walls like one as well. The big difference in this movie is when Peter Parker(Toby Maguire) shoots the web. This Spiderman has no web-shooters. So Peter has to find out how to shoot the web from his wrists. That was funny. When gets the costume worked out, it's amazing. The people around Parker makes a difference: Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst); Peter's squeeze, Aunt May Parker(Rosemary Harris); a strong mother figure, Harry Osborn(James Franco) Peter's friend who he and his father, Norman(Willem Dafoe) are very disturbing. Norman becomes the maniacal Green Goblin. J.Jonah Jamesom(J.K. Simmons) a tough but slanderous editor of the Daliy Bugle. This movie pans itself out. Liked it from the beginning to the end!

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," For the gamer in you!
","For all the gamers in the world, this movie is for you! Fans of fighting games of all titles, 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' is in a class by itself. Here you have this guy name Scott Pilgrim(Micheal Cera), who's in a band, has a young girlfriend who worships him. All of a sudden, he meets this much older girl who has dated 7 different people. Also known has her 7 Evil Exes. When the evil exes find out about Scott Pilgrim, they want him dead! And it's game on! Like every other fighting game, points and bonuses are given out to the players. The other bands would try anything to get to the top spot, especially the ones who happen to be one of the evil exes. Scott may have been such a dork in life, especially when he was with the young girl named Knives(Ellen Wong). She wasn't right for Scott socially but, she will always be his top fan. For all the gamers in the world, this one doesn't require a joystick, nor coins to continue. There is plenty of action, comedy, and suspense in this movie. I enjoyed it very much! 3 out of 5 stars!

Resident Evil," LIKE BEING IN THE GAME ALMOST!
","Anyone who's into video games should see this movie. It really shows it's displays of horror, gore and violence. Yet, in was also intriguing and entertaining in the process. Milla Jovovich did very well playing Alice, the main character in the movie. I liked the part when the dogs attacked her and she shot them all down. Finding out that marital status isn't all it's cracked up to be would be a big factor, but it is. That trap the computer did was awesome, and the virus that spread out in the place was something too. At the end I would know that Alice would be ready to face another challenge being thrown to her. And she'll just get that! This movie isn't for everyone, only the strong should try it.Rating: VIDEO GAMERS ONLY 5 STARS! 8.5 OUT OF 10!",Null,0,1,20 September 2004
Dirty Dancing," Doesn't get any dirtier than this!
","The 60's are something to live by, and this movie brings some important nostalgia there. The cast of this movie are memorable. Patrick Swayze(The Outsiders, Steel Dawn, and Red Dawn) puts on a spectacular role as the cool Johnny Castle. Jennifer Grey(Joel's daughter) plays the naive Baby Houseman, who learns the ropes of dancing. These two main characters build a chemistry so hot, you wouldn't bother neutralizing the two elements. The musical soundtrack is really the bomb, several classics like Bruce Channel(Hey Baby!) I danced along to the song dozens of times. It's funny when Baby and Johnny keep splashing in the water when maintaining their balance. Solomon Burke's 'Cry to Me' is memorable all the time. I always shudder when Johnny removed Baby's top in that scene. Gives me the rush every time. Not only does Swayze acts and dances, he sings. 'She's like the Wind' blows your mind every time. At the dancing finale Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes 'I've Had The Time of My Life' will leave everyone singing and dancing at the same time, and the lift is PERFECT! After seeing this movie I said to myself, 'This movie really deserved 3 stars!' Now it gets 2 more because it's a classic!",10,2,5,21 December 2005
Alien vs. Predator," I SMELL A SEQUEL!
","This movie is a lot more intense than the other sequels I've seen. Though some of the lines were quite similar to Predator 2. Part of the scenes were closer to the comic book sequences that I've read before. The rest is hard to put into words. And I think the tagline was a little off to me. I think the real losers are the Aliens. They may have strength in numbers, but the Predators have the muscle and the fire power to wipe out the whole colony like they were roaches, rats, or any disgusting pests that infect the planet. The explorer (Sanaa Lathan) was the toughest of all characters, got herself branded by the Predator which to me is a sign of honor to the group showing she had her part in the hunt. I'm glad to see this action-packed thriller, and I know a sequel is in the making. Rating 3 out of 5 stars 8.5 out of 10!",Null,0,0,15 September 2004
Days of Thunder," NASCAR fun for everyone!
","Despite being a fictional team for NASCAR, 'Days of Thunder' packs plenty of action both racing and excitement altogether. Tom Cruise plays the role of Cole Trickle, a feisty upstart who gets his breaks in being a stock car driver. Cocky and hotheaded his first win gets him pumped for more. With Robert Duvall as Harry Hogge Randy Quaid as Tim Daland, and Nicole Kidman as Dr. Lewicki, you got a winner! Being a winner isn't all what its cracked up to be. You got to be looking out for one another. And I liked the part where they played a prank on Trickle with that NC State Trooper who turned out to be a hot babe. I thought state troopers were rugged looking, then again who knows. The accident scene was plenty scary, and the troop incident went to Trickle's head a little too much. Now 'Stroker Ace' is another movie I can recommend you if you want some humor to go along with. It contains all the names of NASCAR then and now. Crank up you engines folks, 'Days of Thunder' is coming your way! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.",9,1,2,26 January 2006
Batman Begins," So this is how it starts, almost!
","Everything you know about the Dark Knight's origin begins here. This movie really tops the 1989's version big time. The vehicles, the weapons, and the action was totally non-stop. Christian Bale is very good playing Batman and Bruce Wayne very well. Knowing how or who killed his parents was interesting. This is the true retrospective of Batman's origins. And they showed who killed them, and how his avenge of them went south. The killer is killed by a young woman, and his quest for vengeance goes on further than he imagined. He gets the training from Henri Ducard(Liam Neesom) who turned out to be a total fanatic who thinks he's a purist who is nothing really but a maniac. And the first BatMobile, man, that really puts the others to shame. Large, but maneuverable, this vehicle really gave Batman the edge on evil. Sgt. James Gordon(Gary Oldman) really envied Batman for his weapons, and The BatMobile is really on his top priority. The weapons, the tactic, and the skill of The Caped Cruisader is top notched. And the cast are really top of the line. Couls I say any more than that? I don't think so. I've enjoyed this movie very well. 5 stars.",10,0,2,15 July 2006
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A masterpiece by Peter Jackson!
","I enjoyed this movie to the max. Peter Jackson really outdid himself there. The Hobbit is a movie prequel to The Lord of the Rings, dealing with Bilbo (Martin Freeman), who was tricked into having a party at his abode. Earlier, a dwarf king rules a mountain until a dragon takes the gold the king has hoarded. That act cost him his life. Though Bilbo was very reluctant at first, he comes to aid when the Mountain Trolls steal the ponies, then capture the army for their dinner. Bilbo stalled them long enough for Galdolf the Grey (Ian McKellan) makes his move by cracking some light on the trolls: they fear bright light. Then they encounter the cave where they find the treasure and some weaponry in which Bilbo gets a sword for himself. This sword has a blue glow to it. Then after the separation of him and the dwarfs he encounter Gollum, a hobbit who was corrupted by a ring. Bilbo took it from him while he was eating the goblin. Following the battle, Bilbo proved his worth. This prequel has a very good meaning to it. Tolkien works will remember many things for years to come. It's great. 5 stars!",10,14,23,29 January 2013
Before Sunset," Enjoyable from the start!
","Ever tried to go back to your first love you met years ago? And later you're involved with someone else, and not very happy? This movie gives the word comfort in a whole new meaning. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke star in the sequel to the movie 'Before Sunrise'. They show the flashbacks of 'Before Sunrise' and it makes the movie more enjoyable to watch. And Julie Delpy's role of Celine is 'tre magnifique'. She sings, and plays the guitar. This movie can be enjoyed in any language. OOH! LaLa! However, the story has a lot of flashbacks and what the future holds for each. Each one found love after nine years apart, yet neither one is happy. Jesse(Ethan Hawke) is a father, but his marriage to his wife is a total mess, Celine(Julie Delpy) is striking out everywhere in France. Both shared their joys and pains, and they seem to rely on each other when they first met. This movie can be definitely used in French class, and I think it can also used as a learning experience for all. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.",10,3,5,26 May 2006
The Transporter," Man! This movie is even better than I hoped for!
","Man! I had a feeling this movie would be a big hit. AND IT IS!! The Transporter combines action with martial arts, romance, and intrigue all into one. I kept rewinding all the great action scenes shown. Especially the well timed catch will the gun, and the dropkick to the door 'The Transporter' did. This merc was a one man army who doesn't like to be tricked! Or Ticked! Don't mess with The Transporter! Jason Statham will definitely be the next martial arts star of the 21st century! He rocks! He really intensify the audience with his moves and he's so hardcore, anyone with lemon for a brain should know better than to mess with 'The Transporter'. Being a mercenary is hard work, retaining the skills shouldn't be difficult. The music was good in the movie it suited it well. The lovely kidnap victim (Qi Shu) had a lot of mouth, but a lot of guts when her own father put her through hell all her life. She wouldn't turn on Frank after she helped her. Lots of action and adventure is what the movie provided, and it's a big keeper as well. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.",10,0,2,3 May 2003
28 Days Later...," Excellent movie!
","Apocolyptic movies are always something to look up to when such a disaster strikes. '28 Days Later' is one movie that really intrigues me. Being set in London, it's always easy to see what life is like after a deadly virus spreads out England. Thinking that you are all alone would be a factor, it goes to shows you're wrong all the time. This man Jim(Cillian Murphy) finds survivors in different locations. With everything down, and people died out, they can survive well without looting because there's no lawmen around the bloody place. Syphoning gas from other vehicles, and trying to find sanctuary is also needed as well. There are more survivors though, but these guys are up to something, and it's not good. The hospital victim does one good deed, that is save the two ladies from the soldiers who captured the infected ones in their quarters. The young girl may have been orphaned, she was still a strong character in the movie. And Selena(Naomi Harris), doesn't play around herself. She watched Jim like a hawk. If you saved my life, I'll save yours. A very good movie, despite being a horror, it was also subtle as well. Jolly Good, Chap! 4.5 out of 5 stars!",9,0,1,26 April 2007
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Breath Taking!
","Fast, Swift, Skillful, and Cunning. This movie got a lot of all the way! Ang Lee has made the best martial art film I've ever seen! 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' takes where others have their limits. Chow Yun Fat plays a master who guards a sword with a 'Emerald Blade' to it. Michelle Yeoh(Supercop 1&2,) plays the friend and lover of the master. And I liked the way of the choreographs were made. Flying and fighting at the same time, not using ropes or cables to climb. That will made the most skilled fighter bow into defeat. Zhang Ziyi, plays the fighter who steals the sword, and learns hard truths from the two. She is a formidable fighter, and a big hothead as well. She does have a sexy side to her, after being kidnapped, her true self is portrayed well to say the least. I wish I could say more about this movie, but it's up to you to see it for yourself. This movie is to good to explain to everyone, I enjoyed every time I watch it. 5 STARS!",10,3,5,17 February 2006
Ghost Rider," This action movie really heat things up!
","Another Marvel Comic based movie has sprung up! In 'Ghost Rider' Nicholas Cage plays daredevil Johnny Blaze, who makes a bargain with the devil(Peter Fonda) to spare his father's life. Of course I read about that part, instead of that terminal cancer, he lost his life in a stunt accident. Then there's his love Roxanne(Eva Mendes) who meets Johnny Blazes years later. After that pact he made, Johnny Blaze becomes a flaming-skulled avenger, The Ghost Rider. The effect of Cage becoming the Rider was amazing. And that chopper, who knew having your own custom design would made a difference. Or better yet, make other owners jealous. At the jail scene, Ghost Rider made the character more extreme when he got the prisoner's jacket and gloves, and it was very funny when that innocent prisoner fainted after The Rider escaped. Sam Elliot was awesome playing the first Ghost Rider, Slade. He was cool and collected, and he never showed any sign of worry or doubt. This movie has got some humor to it, and it's worth my while as well. They weren't kidding about burning up the road, Ghost Rider really puts that down hard and fast! 4.5 out of 5 stars!",9,8,15,19 February 2007
The Elephant Man," Heart Warming!
","True stories are always something good to watch. 'The Elephant Man' is one story that shows a lot of heart of a man who sees the beauty of life even though his appearance in unsightly. John Merrick(John Hurt) is a victim of sideshow exploitation who is later rescued by a kind Victorian Doctor(Anthony Hopkins). His loyal kindness, and understanding makes Merrick more of a man than a monster. All of a sudden, he hears John recite, 'The Lord is My Shepard, I Shall Not Want....', Dr. Treves(Hopkins) is surprised. Being a Christian that he is, John Merrick is a amazing. He meets a variety of people in London, including a dancer named Mrs. Kendal(Anne Bancroft). This woman saw through his visage, only to find a very kind heart. Merrick is an artist as well. His works are a true classic. When the cruel Mr. Bytes(Freddie Jones) claims him back, everyone in the carnival, turned on him and helped Merrick back into society. It was a very strong point where John lashed out at the crowd saying, 'I am not a monster! I am not an animal!' 'I am a human being!' He proved his point down outright! At the night of the concert, he not only got total acceptance from the audience, but honor as well. The movie sends a message, and it's very educational as well. A strong must have! 5 stars!",10,0,0,30 January 2007
I Am Legend," Means very well!
","Will Smith done a great job with this movie. 'I Am Legend' shows the true meaning of heroism. Smith plays military doctor Robert Neville. Very brilliant, also he very perturbed. In New York, it's a total ghost town. Only wildlife and infected people populate there. He and his dog Sam roam the deserted Big Apple all by himself, hunting for game, playing golf on a fighter plane, and whatever he can do. He does capture one of the infected ones, and try to find an antidote of the virus that wiped out NYC. He lost his wife and daughter when one of the helicopters was trying to sway off the mutants. When he tried to make contact with other survivors, a mother and son help him out. It's sad when one of the mutant dogs got Sam, and Robert had to kill it. That's just as bad when the dog is rabid. At least he didn't die in vain, he fought to find the cure that would make him 'a legend'. This movie was very moving, and it got a lo of heart. Real heroes are remembered all the time not just in a war, but for biological reasons as well. 4.5 out of 5 stars!",9,0,0,5 May 2008

Here you have a teen named Dave Lizweski (Aaron Johnson), quiet, awkward, invisible to girls who has an obsession with comic books. He lives with his father, after his mother died at the breakfast table, he descends into total silence with himself. It took some reading of comic books which would make him something interesting; a superhero. But his friends thinks he's out there. Maybe. But one day when he and his pal get robbed, Dave goes into this mode that changes his persona for the better of mankind: Kick-Ass. When he meets the same thugs, he gets attack and stabbed.

The result of that; police corruption that lead to his wife's death, and his imprisonment by a corrupt detective(Xander Berkley).

Gran Torino," 'Get off my lawn!' is the new 'Go Ahead, Make My Day!'
","Clint Eastwood is at it again. In 'Gran Torino' it's a nouveau gem in the rough! Clint plays Walt Kawolski, a grizzled Korean War veteran, who's too bitter to be accepting change. He resents the new neighbors on his block. A group of Hmongs move next door and he's full of contempt for those people. He's a widower, and he's also dying of cancer. On his birthday, he throws out his kids when they give him a chance for independent living. He later on slowly, changes his view when a young Hmong named Thao(Bee Vang), tried to be part of a local gang. His initiation, steal Walt's Gran Torino. His sister gets rescued by Walt when some black thugs start hassling her around. She later gives Walt a birthday dinner he'll never forget. When he sees Thao being a zero on getting the ladies, Walt gives his a crash course he'll never forget. Though he doesn't see himself as a hero to the Hmong, he ends up being one. Giving the chance to earn Walt's trust, he lends him the car when he gets the lovely girl. Now that's trust! Both men get vengeful when the Hmong gang attacks Thao's family, and brutally attack his sister, Walt was furious! He beats up one member when Thao gets his face burned. Walt ended up a hero when he confronted the gang. At least he got peace, the painful way. Well, maybe. It was funny where he was explicit with his will. He only wanted Thao to have the Gran Torino. Simply, he doesn't trust the granddaughter. Yes, he may have been hardcore, but he was old-school as well. Sue(Ahney Her) looked up to him a lot. Though he may not agree with her actions, he kinda did, just wouldn't show it. Some things would make any man bitter, it takes time to give it a chance. Most people let the past go to their brains. Walt didn't. He did get a chance to be a father figure again, to some who's not from his family. Clint Eastwood always know how to make a hit. He did point to some of my favorites, Ford Motor Vehicles. That what really got me going. Also diversity, that what makes the world go round. Learn the ropes, from a veteran is always going to be better than learn things from a rookie. This movie is a gemstone. 'GET OFF MY LAWN!' is the new classic here! 5 stars!",10,1,6,23 February 2009

Then when he meets the ancestors, he had to use the name Clint Eastwood, so he wouldn't let them know he's a descendant. The bar scene is a hoot. The fancy footwork, Marty(Michael J. Fox) singing the song 'BAD'. Then he has to save his friend, 'Doc' Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd) from an assassination. Finding out stuff from the 50's was a necessity, both Doc and Marty worked together as a fine team. The train scene is classic, since there's no fuel around the locomotive boosted the DeLorean, and went back on the tracks when Marty comes back to 1985. The Delorean may have been history, but the locomotive become the new time machine. Far Out! This movie was perfect. I liked very well. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are a team.

This time the menace is known as the Silver Surfer aka Norrin Radd. However, the real threat isn't him, it's his master Galactus: The Devourer of worlds. When the group encounter strange phenomenas in certain parts of the worlds, the closest thing that can happen, will certainly hit home. I liked the part when Johnny Storm went after the Surfer and the touch affect his powers. When he touched his sister, he was out of sight, she was just hot. The embarrassment occurred when she landed naked, as usual! The real cool scene is when he got Thing's power. Ben Grimm got the last laugh. The bachelor party scene was cool. Reed really got the party started when he loosened up. The return of Dr. Victor Von Doom(Julian McMahon) was inevitable. He's back to his old schemes as usual, wanting more power. I liked it when The Torch got all the powers of his teammates and said the Thing's quote, 'It's clobberin' time!' The next thing would the attraction of Skrulls. Johnny really put a hurting on Doom. And for the Surfer, Susan really got through to him. And he did return the favor to her when Doom downed her. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end, it was a lot more fun than the first.

There are two factions fighting: The Autobots lead by Optimus Prime(Peter Cullen) who protect the humans from the Decepticons lead by Megatron, who's bent on world domination. In this movie, the action has taken to a whole new level. There's this goofy, geeky teen named Sam(Shia LaBeouf) who gets a old yellow Chevy Camaro that has a surprise he'll never forget. The Camaro is an alien robot named Bumblebee(in the cartoon he was a Volkswagon) and he did a very good job of taken care of Sam. Then later, more Autobots come to help Bumblebee: Jazz; he was a smooth-talking and hip car. Ironhide; tough as nails, ready to kick some serious Decepticon butt. Ratchet; very medical-wise. And last but not least, the leader Optimus Prime. The action of the movie was non-stop, and the comedy was all there. That helped balance the act of this movie, compared to the cartoons. This movie is off the hook, the cast is super, the storyline is one of a kind! Not kid friendly, though it's old-school to me. This movie can go on for generations. AUTOBOTS, TRANSFORM! AND ROLL OUT!

Empire Records," Rock 'n Roll Fun!
","This movie was worth seeing in my opinion. My instincts shows that this movie is a real hit. A marvelous cast, a great plot, and plenty of sex appeal made this movie really good. Anthony LaPaglia, Debi Mazar, Renne Zellweger, and Liv Tyler made this movie a hit. Rory Cochrane is astonishing at playing Lucas, the employee who gambles the $9000+ in a casino. Sure he got slammed by the boss, but who wants to be bought out by a bigwig who wants only money? I wouldn't. Then comes in Rex Manning(Maxwell Caulfield), a music video, TV legend who helps promote the store, is nothing more than a time-warped has been. Cory(Tyler) really showed her sexual prowess in the lunch scene. That's Steve's daughter for ya! Rock on! And there's Debra(Robin Tunney) very bipolar, shaves her head, then gets to lighten up and see what's really important. When the employees and their boss fight against the buyout, they are the heroes of the movie. Strum a guitar on that one. The music was great, the scenes are fantastic, it's too bad this movie was a limited premiere. I give it 3 stars, just to be honest.",9,0,0,11 April 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Worth Every Dollar!
","Clint Eastwood is always at his best. This movie in my opinion tops 'UNFORGIVEN', hands down. Yet, this is 'UNFORGIVEN's' equal. Hilary Swank was great playing the heavily determined boxer. If it hadn't been for her tenacity, she would automatically given up. Morgan Freeman who worked with Eastwood in 'UNFORGIVEN' is back with him. He's the more somber character in the movie, while Eastwood plays the harden one. Given the spot to teach Maggie the ropes of boxing wasn't all its cracked up to be, at least it was Frankie's first to teach a girl. Maggie(Swank) is nothing like her role Julie in 'The Next Karate Kid'. In that movie, she was surly. Frankie Dunn(Eastwood) is nothing like 'Dirty' Harry, yet he displays some hardcore attitude in the movie which makes it watchable. To me, Maggie was the person who show determination, and receives inspiration from Frank, cause to him, he's reminds her of her late father. Since she has complete distrust in her family, she tries to give them what they needed, in return, they ended up being ungrateful, so why send them something? All they want to do is snuff it up. This movie also shows that even the gruffest of all grumps can have a softer side. And it's the first I've seen Eastwood get soft. AWWWWW! But Hey! This movie was no hype. It's a clear winner to me! 5 stars!",10,2,4,10 January 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," A great sequel! Way more action packed!
","The sequel to 'Resident Evil' has come! It makes you be more in the movie than watching it. Milla Jovovich returns as the deadly Alice. She's even more enhanced. Which is some I liked for her to be. This movie didn't bore me at all. And that freak that Alice fought is the cross of 'Alien' and Chatter Cenobite of 'Hellraiser'. There was nothing to miss, even though some of the scenes moved faster than usual. However, the more you watch the movie, the better you'll understand it. The credit goes to Capcom games most definitely. They always make great games, and Screen Gems didn't let the audience down either. There were more zombies than usual but that doesn't matter, it made the movie more interesting. And I liked the part where Alice nearly put the guy's eye out with his own pen. Shows the meaning, 'Get the point?' The news teams were complete idiots, they're giving praise to the evil corporation, and not the journalist. For shame. They'll learn the hard way next time, if there is one. If I was in this movie, I would join Alice, armed to the teeth! Rating 4 out of 5 stars!",9,1,2,20 September 2005

First left at the alter 'dead' and pregnant. When she comes to, her baby is gone. Unknowst to her, that her child is still alive and well. Too bad that they didn't show her child after she was comatose all these years.

When Seth loses it when his brother Richard rapes and kills the teacher they kidnapped. That makes Seth mad at him all right, he would probably kill his brother as well. So they ditch that nice Mercury for a RV containing a widower(Harvey Kitel) and kids(Juliette Lewis,Ernest Liu). I don't know what goes on in the mind of Richard but Seth keeps his cool at all times. When the group goes South of the Border, it's an all-night truck stop. Giving to the term tourist trap. It's a trap all right. When this tavern is owned by blood-sucking vampires, there was no time for these people to scurry. The killers knew what they were up against. So the family help the killers and the other tourists rid themselves of these pests, sadly some of them fell victim to the blood-suckers. Cheech Marin had a lot of roles in this movie, and the pyramid was indeed surprising to see along with the trashed rigs at the bottom. This movie is all about the dangers of tourist traps, they weren't kidding! Great movie great cast, excellent results! Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars.",10,1,2,9 December 2005
Logan," Feral to the finish!
","One of the finest of X-Men is Wolverine(Hugh Jackman). In the future, he no longer goes by that name. He is known as James Howlett, or 'Logan'. His powers are Adamantiun claws and skeleton and a mutant healing factor which is now reduced due to time. He's not the warrior at his prime. He's now a limousine driver. Helping his former teacher Charles Xavier(Patrick Stewart), who now has to take medicine because of psychic seizures he suffers. 
But in the midway of the situation, there's another mutant with the same ability as Logan. It's Laura, aka X-23. The only difference is that she has 2 claws on each hand and one claw on each foot. But don't count Logan out, he can still fight. 
When he worked as a limousine driver, he did his job well. He handled himself well when one of the passengers flashed him. Logan wasn't such an absentee father, at least it wasn't Daken.
Violence and action was non-stop in this film. And that X-24 was more menacing. Logan is a warrior to the end. 
Nothing else can match the tenacity Logan can bring.

Men in Black," I HEAR YOU WILL SMITH
",SciFi will never be the same once you put Will Smith at the helm. Both he and Tommy Lee Jones did very well together playing the duo who stop criminals of the 3rd kind. Having Smith's character go beyond the norm on fighting crime is a special privilege for him. The video was a big topper at the end. That's what made it best. A 10!,Null,0,0,25 September 2003
The Graduate," Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Robinson, she's the reason this movie is great!
","Sultry, seductive, and tempting, these are the things that describe Mrs. Robinson in the movie, 'The Graduate'. A 60's hit with stars of tomorrow. Like Dustin Hoffman, before he did this movie he did a commercial for Volkswagon a year earlier. And now this, he plays a college grad who is clueless on what to do next. Maybe, just maybe. Here you have Mrs. Robinson, wife of his father's friend, and mother of Elaine. I don't know you but I thing any scene with Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft is great. The first scene is when she traps Ben in her daughter's room and is naked right in front of Ben. Too many flash backs and I got really confused. The second time was better for me. In the hotel scene, where she asks Ben to unzip her top, and then she takes it off, I said 'WHOA!' NICE BODY, ANNE! I would rewind that scene over and over again. This scene puts other seductress to shame. Then the third hotel scene is really the one with the liner: 'Are you trying to seduce me?' DUH! BENJAMIN! This movie is sinfully seductive and one of the guiltiest pleasures any young man would have. If you like that try these: A Tiger's Tale Flirting with Disaster Spanking the Monkey Or any other movie of your liking. In my opinion this movie IS THE ONE BABY! 5 STARS! ALL THE WAY!",10,1,2,8 June 2005
Grindhouse," Cheesy, yet a fun-house as well!
","Exploitation films are a real big deal in the 1970's. When you combine the genius work of Freddy Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, you got a big hit on your hands! In 'Grindhouse' two movies are shown for this big title. First you see 'Planet Terror' by Rodriguez, there's a strange biochemical that makes zombies, a go-go dancer(Rose McGowan) loses her leg to a those monsters, a mysterious loner(Rodriguez) who fights the zombies and gives Cherry, a machine gun on her stump. There's plenty of action, plenty of humor, and plenty of sexual interaction which gets edited. However, it was very fun to watch. Cherry really puts the 'A' in action when she launched herself into action against the zombies. And the dance skills she's done has paid off. It was more funny when she replaces the smaller gun for the Gatlin gun. Wray would have been more proud. In 'Death Proof', the main weapon is a 1970 Chevy Nova driven by Stuntman Mike(Kurt Russell). This man is so bad, I wouldn't ride with him. This one has much more action, and will leave you on the edge of your seat, literally. Both movies were great, and those coming attractions were hilarious, despite they were phony. Other than that I enjoyed them. Forget the popcorn, enjoy nachos with this movie! HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! 4 OUT OF 5 STARS!",9,1,6,7 April 2007
There's Something About Mary," You're right, I agree with the title
","This to me is one of the funniest comedies of 1998. Ever since 'The Mask', Cameron Diaz is on a hot streak. Playing the object of every man's desire, no wonder she's so irresistible! Ever since the prom night accident, Ted(Ben Stiller) wants to see here after all those years. Zipping up his 'franks and beans' was embarrassing enough, but seeing Mary(Diaz) fixing her strap didn't cause him to wonder. I knew from the start this movie was good. Then when Mary was living in Florida, Ben hires Pat Healy(Matt Dillon) the sleazy detective, not only to find her but to have her for himself. I think switching binoculars wasn't that important when Mary was unhooking her bra. But seeing that overly tanned lady top was a riot. All these characters, all the laughs, this movie got it all. Brett Farve as himself, that boosts the NFL big time. I laughed till my insides hurt, 'There's Something About Mary' is a must see movie. And The Farrelly Brothers did a fantastic job at it. Way to go Farrellys! 5 stars!",10,0,1,7 March 2006
Mission: Impossible," AT LEAST THIS ONE IS NOT LIKE THE TV!
","Now I've seen a lot of updated movie versions of TV shows. This one didn't have any cameos from the TV show, maybe except the informant who gives Jim the assignment. There was a big difference between the TV version and the movie version of Mission:IMPOSSIBLE. The TV's of Jim Phelps was loyal to his team. The movie version was a turncoat. I liked the part when Jack gives out the RED LIGHT/GREEN LIGHT explosive that looked like an ordinary stick of gum. Now I heard gums that burst with flavor, this one I will definitely avoid. The movie had a nice plot, and it had a lot of action. I say it was one of the biggest hits in 1996! Rating 10! 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,1,29 November 2004
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Different movie, same old fun!
","Kevin McAllistar(Macaulay Culkin)is at it again. This time, he in the Big Apple. And boy, could it get any better than this. How did Kevin get to New York? Simple, he boarded the wrong plane. The family were heading to Florida for a Christmas vacation, Kevin got sidetracked when he went to the store to get batteries for his recorder. When he realized he went on board a plane to New York. He said, 'I did it, again!' Lost and curious, he did come upon his old nemeses, Marv(Daniel Stern) and Harry(Joe Pesci). How did they end up in New York? Round 2, those guys will never learn! Kevin has upped the ante on fighting these bungling burglars. This time, Kevin has one new ally, the bird woman. Those two didn't stand a chance. Not only it was the two goons, but the hotel staff as well. Man, that is totally outrageous. The family did have to take a trip to the Big Apple, and stayed and the same place, Kevin did. This movie's got some magic there compared to the first. Just as enjoyable though. 4 out of 5 stars!",9,0,0,24 December 2006
A Clockwork Orange," The future has never been so disturbing!
","Stanley Kubrik has put up a fine sci-fi thriller about the future where total chaos rules. Even if the world doesn't look like the Apocalypse, the society running with vermin make it look that way. Especially where the The Droogs live. In a futuristic England, these degenerates run around causing havoc and mayhem. They kill, rape, and brutalize anyone who got in their way. Alex(Malcom McDowell) leads the way of these ruthless gangs. He later shows his brutality on his own friends when he hits one of them in the groin with his cane, and hidden inside is a knife that cuts the other's hand. Knowing that he tends to himself at home, out in the open, he's an bomb ready to explode. In one scene, the attacks the woman, his friends leave him behind by breaking his nose with a milk bottle. While Alex is doing some time, I liked the scene were he was being reformed in a sadistic way, where he literally goes out of his mind. Hoping that he is 'cured' he goes back to society, where his 'friends' are in law-enforcement. After that suicide attempt, the country gives him the clemency, to me that was not a good idea, after he said, 'I was 'cured' all right!' That means he can revert to his ways again, if he did that, they won't be so easy next time. A very good but chilling movie, highly intense, and very disturbing scenes. This movie is not for the weak! Rating 5 stars!",10,0,1,13 July 2006
The Fly," Here's The Buzz!
","This movie is buzzing all around. Here you have a reclusive scientist, Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum) who invents the Telepod(A device for teleportation), which should make life easier. He gets notoriety from a report name Veronica Quaife(Geena Davis, Jeff's wife then). He tells her to test in out using her pantyhose to do it. It works on inorganic life, when he used it or one of the baboons, it turned it inside out. Then he used it to cook a steak. and the taste was very questionable. So he modifies the machine, and the other baboon did fine. The Seth does the unthinkable he tries it out, with complete success. There's only one thing, he had an uninvited guest; A housefly! Not only was the teleporter a success, it how became a gene-splicing machine! It gave him strength, an insatiable appetite for sugar, and the abilities of a fly. The arm-wrestling scene was indeed scary especially when Brundle breaks the guy's arm. Then he becomes very inhuman day by day. Than condition makes cancer easy to treat. and the results is scarier than the 1958 version. The cast are great, and the special effects are amazing. Plenty of scariness, gore, and stunts that's fun for horror buffs. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",9,1,3,20 July 2006
Total Recall," Extreme unbelievability!
","Sci-fi has been taken to the max, in more ways than others. In 'Total Recall', reality and fantasy is very hard to tell. The cast in the movie are perfect: Arnold Swartzenegger, Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin, Michael Ironside, and others to name make the movie rock! Living on the planet Mars would be good. Unfortunately, the gases are highly toxic. I liked everything this movie has given. It was full of surprises. The mutants for instance are very unique, some were grotesque. The woman who flashed her three breasts would make any normal man want to be a mutant. That mutant dwarf was very tough. And I like the fight scene between Stone's character and Ticotin's. I liked the part when Arnie's character separated himself from his dangerous 'wife', saying, 'Consider this a divorce!' The art of sci-fi has really put me in this movie very much. Doing your nails without all the mess, getting to know the truth about things is a must for some people. Plenty of action, full of thrills, this movie is straight off the edge of your seat fun! An Arnie classic. 5 stars!",10,6,7,8 June 2007
Eyes Wide Shut," KUBRICK'S FINAL MASTERPIECE!
","It's sad that this movie is Stanley Kubrick's final piece of work, but the memory of Kubrick will live on in his other work as well. This movie was loaded from the beginning to the end. The sex, the nudity, the intrigue, I mean this movie was hard core. It put 'A Clockwork Orange' another great Kubrick film to second place. Though Cruise and Kidman are no more, at least we can relish the chemistry they put on in that movie. There are so many scenes in there I don't where to begin.I can start off my favorite scene where Milich, the new costume store owner handled the two Asian men who invited by Milich's daughter(Leelee Sobieski) who used Cruise as a shield against her father wearing nothing but a bra and panty. After whispering in Cruise's ear, and then giving him a look, my first response was, 'UH-OH!'The orgy scene was unbelievable, I think that will be the lesson the Cruise's character will have to learn for the rest of his own life.I think this movie shows the meaning of one's sense of morality, and the price it has on its tag. I was great, and I think Kubrick is smiling in heaven. R.I.P. STANLEY KUBRICK!5 STARS AND DEFINITELY A 10+!!",Null,0,1,7 July 2004
Pretty Woman," When dreams do come true!
","Cinderella stories happens to anyone who can follow the dream. In 'Pretty Woman' it does so. Here you have a prostitute name Vivian(Julia Roberts) who walk the streets of Hollywood making her tricks until one night, she meets a businessman(Richard Gere) who makes an offer she can't refuse. She gets to live it up, and gets her share of the life without worry. Being in luxury is a must for the wealthy, getting the experience makes you think you can do it. For Vivian, she's a hooker, and everyone around her sees her as trouble. Edward(Gere) who shows her around treats her like a princess. Yes, she maybe a hooker, but she's not like the others who strung out on drugs, get beat up by their pimps, or even worse get killed by them as well. Vivian seems to be the one who wants out of the biz of turning tricks, but what she wanted the most is have the Cinderella ending most women want in their lives. Make no difference who you are or what you are dreams to come true. This is very heart warming, and also very fun all the way.

Pulp Fiction," Hardcore action and adventure!
","Quentin Taratino really outdid himself with this movie. 'Pulp Fiction' is truly hardcore, has plenty of action and truly got meaning in these intertwined stories. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play mob hit men Vincent and Jules. Jules is a Bible Thumper, while Vincent is just unsure about anything. Uma Thurman plays Mia Wallace, a fun-loving, drug-using babe who wants to have fun. She and Vincent go to a restaurant win a twist contest, would OD on dope, and gets pumped in the heart with adrenaline to revive her. Her husband is ruthless mob boss, Marsellus Wallace(Ving Rhames). Bruce Willis plays boxer Butch Coolidge, who crossed paths with Wallace, fights him to a pawn shop both he and Wallace ended up fair game when the owner and his brother Zed(Peter Greene) are sodomites. The Gimp scene is a classic. Tries to warn the others about Butch's escape, he lets the gimp have it. Butch would get a katana sword, go stealth on the brothers, sees Marsellus get violated by Zed, kills the owner, and stalls Zed while Marsellus seeks revenge by saying, 'Step Aside, Butch'. Butch may got even with the owner, but Zed is Marsellus' business now. Vincent and Jules are seemingly unstoppable when the roommate failed to kill them off. They let him have it! It was a pity when Vincent's gun blew away the young man's head off in the car. And the diner scene, classic. Real in-your-face action is in this movie. Watch it! 5 stars!",10,1,2,14 April 2008
The Da Vinci Code," Interesting!
","Based on the best-selling novel, 'The DaVinci Code' is a highly questionable thriller that made some headlines, yet, to me it's a very watchable movie. Tom Hanks did a spectacular job playing his role as Dr. Langdon. He may have his opinions, yet he has his views on life were right on the dot. Sir Ian McKellan is superb as Sir Leah Teabing. I liked his character in the movie. But I was disappointed he turned out to be a shady character. The clues, the graphic scenes, and the action in the movie made it very interesting to watch. The main thing of that movie is the puzzle. That piece of the puzzle was the real deal to that movie. I don't have any objection to the movie or the book. I just want to see things for myself. Avoid all the controversy, and the media hype, 'The DaVinci Code' puts the 'I' in intrigue. 4.5 out of 5 stars!",9,2,5,10 January 2007
The Shape of Water," Beyond belief
","When I first saw this film, I thought it was going to be ordinary. I've seen 'The Creature from the Black Lagoon' and other 'gill man' movies, this one is a lot less horror. It takes place in the 60's dealing with every aspect of that time: segregation, time for change, and also top secret government information. Here you have two workers Elisa(Sally Hawkins) who is mute, and her coworker, Zelda(Octavia Spencer) who is African American and is her friend and interpreter. They both clean up at a government facility, which they are hiding something, 'Top Secret'. But other than that, there's a scientist who has happen to be a spy from Russia. Elisa secretly has spent time in the area where the creature is being held. She gives him a boiled egg, and teaches him sign language. The spy would rather help the creature than having it destroyed by his own countrymen goes beyond his way to save it. But he's not the only one. There's an ad illustrator(Richard Jenkins) who is friends with Elisa who would know about the creature as well. When Zelda and Elisa bring the creature from the facility, Elisa keeps him in the bathroom in the tub, and have plenty of salt ,because he is a marine creature. GIles(Jenkins) who owns lots of cats met him for the first time wasn't a pleasant one at first. He eats one of the cats, scratched his arm and ran off. But when he comes back to apologize in his own way, he pats his head and touches the arm he scratched. After seeing what happened, everyone comes to terms the creature is like a god.
After seeing the plot and results, I think that the movie is like a match made in heaven. The intimacy between the two beings is unbelievable. And that crazed Colonel is a very disturbing character. I don't care about the negative reviews from the other critics. Besides being 2 hours, it's worth every minute!

The Matrix Reloaded," Good sequel, with a different tone that makes it a hit
","The gang's all here again to battle evil in the 'The Matrix Reloaded' this time there's different and new characters not seen in the the first. You have Zion, there's Bane, there's the Architect. And my favorites the Oracle, and the Keymaker. The Keymaker was the main player in the movie. Making the keys, and helping out our heroes. The best thing about this movie are those villainous twins who go from solid to intangible during the fight. General Motors played a great deal with their Cadillacs especially the SUV that the twins drove. Too bad that they weren't fire proof. Morpheus was very wicked with the Katana. And that collision scene with the two semis was kinda awesome in a way. Too bad the drivers weren't playing chicken. And fighting off the multiple Smiths is no picnic either, but keeping him from prevailing is a must in order to find peace in both worlds. What I saw in this movie so far that it didn't end like the first one did, to me this was a whole different story. It was heroic for Neo to save is love, he knew he had that power, I wished he would used it more often. 4 out of 5 stars.",9,0,1,3 March 2005

","Longing for justice is a gruel task anyone must take, but when a childhood tragedy strikes, one must have the courage to go on after wards. In this case, one could not.

Jane Smith(Angelina Jolie) tries her best to kill John Smith(Brad Pitt). And John, however, can really hold up his end of the deal when he kills. With bullets flying, and sparks blazing, this kind of marriage makes any other bad marriage looks toward simple reconciliation.

Psycho," This is one of Hitchcock's very best films!
","Who would dare to put Janet Leigh in the shower and let 'Mother' stab her many times? HITCHCOCK! Who would show Janet Leigh in bra and half-slip? HITCHCOCK! Who is the master of mystery and mayhem? HITCHCOCK! Yes, it's macabre master himself, Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, British film maker who makes a film for the American audience. This man is not afraid, he is bold, brainy, and very well rounded in his work. And this movie is in my opinion, one of the best he's ever made. Janet Leigh(1927-2004) did an outstanding job playing the thieving Marion Crane. The question does puzzles me in the beginning of the film is why was she wearing white bra and half-slip? Very kinky to start, but very interesting as well. Women like that don't wear white, supposed a downpour would occur and she wore black underneath, it would be quite embarrassing. Or is it? Other than that, she does drive over to the Bates Motel where it's run by Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins,1932-92), may look sensitive, but BEWARE! He always have to listen to Mother. I say Norman needs to avoid Mother, she's a real bad influence! Bates is also a voyeur, he happens to watch Marion undress. Naughty, naughty! For a man who kills women. After he kills Marion which is most likely the most infamous scene, he would try his best for her sister, which is stopped by Sam Loomis(John Gavin). I wonder if Perkins was in to transvestitism to get the role at that time? Hmmmm! Well anyway, this is one of the few hits in the 60's that can be enjoyed for horror fans of every generation. Still for person 17 and over! All I have to say is, WATCH OUT! YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET STABBED! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rating 5 stars!",10,1,4,19 July 2005
Love Actually," With a title like that, who needs to add extra words?
","Love, a word you can't take your mind off of. The characters in this movie explains love in all different ways. Young love, puppy love, lost love, or forgotten love. This movie is nothing but love. And I say in my opinion can be seen in any holiday, not just Christmas or Valentine's Day. But I do say, It's a good Valentine's Day movie. There's some heavy scenes there, and the cynical Brit who thinks his chum wouldn't find any American women who will love him did. He got lucky with the sister of his friend's girlfriend from Texas. The movie is a one of a kind hit in any way. You got Britain's own Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Rory MacGregory, Elton John and other in the cast, along with Ireland's Liam Neeson.I liked the the one who fell for the Portuguese woman who happen to take that cold swim to retrieve the story that blew in the lake. And he had to make a big deal like it was unimportant to him. The title of the movie should have been 'Love is Strange', then again, that title would come as no surprise to anyone.

Jaws," The music number is the reason it's a hit!
","Don't go in the waters! Why? There's a huge man-eating shark, It's JAWS! This movie really puts the fear in Fear Factor! At first I thought it would be in Califorina thats where all the great whites are located, WRONG! A sleepy New England town would have to be the place to be. I would know it would be a fact that sharks would be one of the most feared killer animals we would ever have. I would thought alligators would be the top one. Steven Spielberg has made a success with this movie, it was not only filled with depth, but also intrigue, wonder, and of course horror. It seems that the great white has given a bad rep for its ferocity, but it's our own fear that really does that. In order to give the respects of the shark it to understand them like snakes, the non-poisonous ones, this idea wouldn't get so twisted. However, there has been shark attacks in the past, and this movie is just another scare factor just to keep us out of the water. What a cast, what a hit, this movie was definitely a blockbuster hit, and I would say anything that movie is not a keeper. And that's no fish story. 5 stars!",10,2,4,19 May 2005
Kong: Skull Island," Extremely Primal to say.....
","Going back to when you know what it's on the other side. Exploring the unknown? There's more to see. Remember the 1933 movie 'King Kong'? Well, this is like happened before the blonde beauty, before he was removed from his home. 'KONG: SKULL ISLAND', is the origin of the majestic ape that ruled the island. We do know that Kong is the last of his kind. His family was wiped out by some reptilian creatures that terrorized the island. When two groups of people come to the island: an expedition group, and a military escort led by Lt. Colonel Packard(Samuel L. Jackson). His team laid out bombs on the island that awoke the protector, Kong. He attacks the team and scatters the expedition team. In 1944, an airplane pilot name Hank Marlow(John C. Reilly) encountered Kong along with his Japanese adversary. When they became friends, his friend Ikari was killed by the Skullcrawlers, and he has his sword to remember him with. When the bombs awoke the Skullcrawlers, it was up to Kong to stop them. Knowing that the colonel is a vindictive madman, they would rather help Kong instead. And the legend of Kong is known. Samuel L. Jackson recalls the 'Hold on to your butts' catchphrase made famous in 'Jurassic Park'. Too bad he had to stoop so low to destroy a legend. I remember watching the 2005 version of the 1933 remake. The fight scenes are remarkable. I liked it when Kong ripped out the viscera of the Skullcrawler. No wonder Kong was such a legend. This is great. A must see film! 5 Stars!",10,4,6,18 November 2017

The Waterboy," A fine movie by Sandler of course!
","Adam Sandler is at it again! This time he's a simple waterboy who has the nads for football. All that rage that he kept bottled up, he really shows it. Bobby Boucher(Adam Sandler) lives in the Bayou with his mother, and he wants to make it well with the world. However, his Mama(Kathy Bates) is very protective, but not very sharp. She wouldn't let Bobby have fun, and that's not cool. She claims Bobby as her 'best friend', but she's not very truthful. When Boucher goes to college, he get the opportunity to be educated and to play football. With rage like that, he's perfect. The Coach(Henry Winkler) has a great tattoo of Elvis on his posterior. But Bobby really opens up with a woman named Vicki(Fairuza Balk) who steals Lawrence Taylor's car, and reveals her feelings to Bobby Boucher. I liked the part where Vicki flashes her breasts to Boucher. That stuck on his mind very fast. Boucher uses all his cool wrestling movies on other football teams from the dropkick, to the power-bomb. He even pictured one of the football players as that mean Coach Red Beaulieu(Jerry Reed). After Mama sees Bobby's married, she learned one thing from Bobby: that 'spear of rage' when her husband appears after leaving the family. A perfect solution for deadbeats. Sure beats a gun! Having hidden anger or hidden rage? 'The Waterboy' is for you! Very funny, and highly entertaining. I liked it. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",9,2,6,7 February 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Needed to be free of shame!
","Spending decades in prison for a crime you didn't commit can make an impact on your life. When you bond with a fellow inmate, life will be easier, and redemption follows through. In 'The Shawshank Redemption', two fellow inmates bond throughout the years of hardships and good times. Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins), was arrested for killing his wife and lover, out of pure anger. He meets Red(Morgan Freeman) and they spend years together ironing out the rough spots. With all other dangerous inmates around like murders and rapists, prison life is a living hell! Sometimes the real villains in prison are the officials, including the warden(Bob Gunton), who was the worst of the bunch. Other inmates who raped or stabbed others got worse treatment than the other convicts. Being in the 'Hole'(Solitary Confinment) is not for the weak. One elderly convict Brooks Halten(James Whitmore), couldn't adapt to society very well when he got out. Got a new place and hangs himself. Andy, is very clever. He out cons the warden, gives Red a chance to live the good life, and he made himself a new man. There's a second chance for ex-convicts, if they can give it. 5 stars!",10,1,2,4 May 2008
Scream," Though it was NOT scary, but it's the best horror has given
","This movie has have the audience shaking in their shoes, NOT ME! I don't scare very easily, but Scream is the most intriguing of all horror films. This all star cast gives out information about horror movies. I've watched horror films when I was younger and this movie is some what educational. I called Scream: Horror 101. Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Skeet Ulrich, and many other stars have put some magic into this movie. It starts off with some horror questions, then the scare factor builds the rush for the victims. I liked the part where Matthew Lillard's character said, 'I'll be right back!' Even though he was one of the culprits. Sydney(Neve Campbell) let it all out in the seduction scene with the killer as well. Altogether, I think everyone in the movie are all suspects, but when the smoke clears, it's all over. And this movie wasn't a wasted effort whatsoever. I've enjoyed every bit of it. Score 10!",10,0,0,25 April 2003
Halloween," A legendary classic!
","One of the earliest slasher movies has come to rise above. Halloween is surefire mayhem at its scariest. A killer who wears a mask starts killing his own sister, gets put away in a sanitarium, only to get and kill again. That killer is Michael Myers(Tony Moran). Not only that he stalks his other sister Lauire(Jamie Lee Curtis), he's being stalked by Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasance, 1919-95). The crazy stuff is really at the bed scene where Michael wears the bed-sheet and glasses belonging to Bob(John Michael Gramm), where earlier he stuck around when he encountered Myers. When Bob's girlfriend was strangled when she tried to call Laurie, and Laurie is unaware of that. I liked the part where Laurie stabbed Myers with one of the knitting needles when he attacked her. Gruesome attacks, and defensive counterattacks, this movie is one of the beginnings of the new horror genre. I think it's great! Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars!",9,1,2,23 June 2006
Wonder Woman," Wonderful!!
","This is one DC Comic movie I really enjoyed. I remembered the 1974 early movie starring Cathy Lee Crosby. That one was disappointing because they had a blonde Wonder Woman. The TV series starring Lynda Carter is legend in its own right. This version starring Gal Gadot puts the 'A' in action! It goes back into the Origin of the famed Amazing Amazon. Through the rough and rugged training she received as a young girl, Princess Diana(Gadot). After her training, a pilot enters the island of Themyscira which man is forbidden. He does help the Amazon community fight the Germans. And it was tough for Diana's mother to accept her decision to fight against the Germans. When she goes to London, she and Steve Trevor(Chris Pine) infiltrate and go to stop the enemy from dispersing a powerful version of mustard gas. To the world, she is known as Wonder Woman, and is one fine warrior to everyone's eyes. The high octane action in the film is remarkable. Gal Gadot has a slight resemblance to Lynda Carter. I liked how she handles herself against the Germans and against Ares. I enjoyed the movie very much. I think it is one of the best DC Comics films ever made. Recommended for all the women and girls. Like Supergirl, this Wonder Woman is a must see! Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars!",9,6,15,14 June 2017
Back to the Future Part II," I agree with Doc Brown, 'GREAT SCOTT!'
","This 'BTTF' series really makes sense. The DeLorean/time machine got a big upgrade when Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd) comes back to 1985 from the future. The fuel was different. Because of the upgrade, Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox, Alex Keaton on 'Family Ties') was concerned about having road space. When goes to the future, he gets the picture. Unlike the first one, the really cool part of the movie is when he used those hover-boards. The real foe in this movie is Biff(Thomas F. Wilson), Marty's father's nemesis. Going to the future was fine, so when he went back to 1985, something was wrong. The Hill Valley he knows wasn't the way it was. His house was occupied by another family, and his neighborhood is a crime-zone. The time has been altered, by Biff. the source of the change, The Sports Almanac. The solution, go back to 1955. It was funny when young Biff crashed his car into a manure truck. Thanks to the hover-board, the future of the McFly legacy is safe. This movie got a lot of characters, and Michael J. Fox really outdid himself there. GREAT SCOTT!! 3 OUT OF 5 STARS!",8,0,0,20 July 2007
Carrie," This movie will blow your mind!
","One of the best social misfit movies of all times, only this one has a twist. It's 'Carrie'! Made in 1976, Sissy Spacek the beautiful redhead from Texas, plays the title character hands down! The girls' locker room scene was just the beginning of teenage boys' 'wet dreams'. The showers, the dressing, and the late period Carrie gets that gets her all freaked out. I know she looks like your common outcast. However, hanging with people who ostracize her is a mistake anyone would make. She took care of that little bike brat who shouts 'Crazy Carrie, crazy Carrie!' She should have popped his bike tires with her mind. Then there's the memorable prom scene. 'Dirty pillows' are breasts and the mother was all high and mighty, and full of you know what! The prom was great, expect the pig's blood joke was the ultimate no-no. Everyone in on the joke paid the price big time, by feeling Carrie's rage, telekinetically. And the couple in the car, had their running her over plan went up in smoke as well. If I ever pull a prank on Carrie, she drag me telekinetically to her, either slam me against the wall, or kill me outright. For goodness sake, DON'T CROSS HER!

The Iron Giant," Great for all dreamers!
","This is one modern-day fantasy movie that is great fro all times. 'The Iron Giant' is a touching fantasy movie that will stick in our minds for times to come. Set back in the 1950's, there a young boy named Hogarth(Voiced by Eli Marienthal) who lived with his single mother. His favorite playground is a junkyard. Then one day, he meets an alien robot known as The Iron Giant(Vin Diesel) who is stranded on Earth. He becomes friends with the metallic being and he has a ball. Especially when he gets in an old Cadillac and it's spun around like he's in a merry-go-round. Since he was his only friend, he had to protect the robot from paranoid government agents. When one of them thinks the Earth is under attack, it was up to Hogarth and his mother and boyfriend to stop the Military for making the biggest mistake of their lives. Well, the Iron Giant does his duty by stopping the missile from destroying the Earth. That's true heroism. I enjoyed this movie. Like E.T., only metallic! 5 stars!",10,1,2,14 February 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," Suspenseful and classy at the same time!
","This has everything it can give. The cast of the movie are anything but ordinary, and the plot is well made through and through. Jodie Foster does a spectacular job playing the role of Clarice Starling, a tough rookie FBI Agent. Anthony Hopkins is excellent as the clever, but sinister mass-murderer Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter. She goes to where Lecter(Hopkins) was being held. To me I get the chills being around that guy. But as the old saying goes, 'to get a killer, to find a killer.' That other killer is 'Buffalo Bill'(Ted Levine), a Ed Geine-like killer who kidnapping and killing young women. Unlike Geine, he didn't eat his victims like Lecter. Trusting a killer like Lecter can be bone-chilling, but as long as a trust issue isn't a problem, they can work together. I like the scene where Lecter was in this round cage, and when he called out Clarice to get her papers, he strokes her hand with his finger. Some may call this scene nerve-racking, to me it's a flirt. He trusts Clarice, and I bet she does the same too. Hmmm! Then after that, he gets his dinner, he killed those two guards. He got the liver of the tougher one. Must tastes like foie gras. (HEH HEH!) And he wears the face of the other, another Ed Geine-like action. There's plenty to see in that movie, the moths, the booby traps, and the chilling climax this movie got. It didn't lack anything there! A Neo-classic! 5 stars!",10,1,1,16 September 2006
Vanilla Sky," WHAT,WHO,WHERE, AND WHY? WHAT IS THIS REALLY?
","This movie is downright unbelievable. Is it fantasy? Is it reality? WHAT IS IT? Tom Cruise did very well for a man who is living his life after death. The artwork in the painting was magnificent. The scenes of the crash was incredible. I liked it when his new love Penelope Cruz played her part, and Cameron Diaz played the ex.  There have been a lot of mass confusion at first, but once you get yourself into it, you'll get a clearer view about the movie. Furthermore, it's not all that bad.",Null,0,1,29 October 2003
The Wolverine," The fun really begins here!
","'SNIKT' Yeah bub, our favorite mutant is back in action. Logan (Hugh Jackman), aka 'The Wolverine' is back. Only this time, he's on an adventure of a lifetime. Logan has retreated to the Canadian wilderness following the disbanding of the X-men, the death of Jean Grey, and the bombing of Nagasaki in 1945. The dream that torments him the most is when had forced to kill her when her powers had corrupted her earlier. While in Canada, a mysterious woman named Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who is a lethal assassin for a man name Shingen(Hiroyuki Sanada) who is a crime boss. So when the man Logan saved from the bombing was dying of cancer, Yukio takes Logan to Japan to pay respects. There, he meets the granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto), who called Logan a 'Caveman'. The dying man wanted to give Logan a chance to live a 'normal life'. Logan, however declined. So when he dies unexpectedly, Logan has another dream of Jean Grey which later changed when the woman he met enters his room, and strikes. Her name is Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova), another strange mutant. So at the funeral, the Yakuza (Japanese mafia) attack, and everyone takes action. Logan makes his known berserker attacks, but something was wrong. His healing factor has been negated.

So she ends up his bodyguard during Mariko's kidnapping and Logan's weakened state. But after he found the cause, she was still needed. Mariko helped out Logan against the Silver Samurai.

Iron Man," Iron Man is just golden!
","Iron Might, Iron Will, Iron Strength. These sounds like the qualities of Tony Stark(Robert Downey, Jr.) aka the Invincible Iron Man. Tony Stark is a playboy billionaire who just escaped death from a piece of shrapnel that almost cost him his life. After he succeeds from his father, Tony has no idea that there's a turncoat in his industries. Making that suit of armor is hi-tech and top notch for this man. He's got some good friends to rely on. One of them is Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes(Terrence Howard) and Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow). This movie was totally off the hook. Plenty of action and plenty of comedy. That really put 'Spiderman' to shame. All the cast were great. It's good for Robert Downey, Jr. to redeem himself from all the troubles he had in the past. Jeff Bridges did very well playing the traitorous Obediah Stone. Knowing this movie would do well, a sequel is just right around the corner. So just jet-pack yourself to the theater, and watch this movie! It's a Marvel gemstone! 5 Stars!",10,1,5,2 May 2008
Bruce Almighty," Believe in it!
","This is another Jim Carrey gem everyone must have! Bruce Almighty is a funny as it is. Bruce Nolan(Carrey) is a reporter for a news-team in Buffalo, New York who seems to be anything but happy. You got a job, you should be happy. Not Bruce! He gripes and groans at everything, including to God(Morgan Freeman). So when God talks to him, he gets the message, GOOD!! He gives Bruce his powers, and he does total mischief at first: Making the fire hydrant blow, blows the woman dress up, takes care of the gang which wasn't bad. And the one that busted up my insides, is where he makes his rival, Evan Baxter(Steve Carrell) look like a total idiot on live TV! It took me a while recover from that. Other than that, it's a very awesome movie. Great cast, great plot, great storyline. This movie will leave you in stitches all the way. Lisa Ann Walter killed me on 'Pyramid', that's another story though. Look up, and watch 'Bruce Almighty' 5 stars!",10,7,13,29 August 2008
Lucy," Open your minds
","Luc Besson, the genius behind The Transporter movies has done it again. Only this time, he has the way to open people's minds in 'Lucy'. He's got the perfect stars in this film. Scarlett Johansson plays the title role, and Morgan Freeman is a professor who theories ended up being proved by her. College student Lucy(Johansson) is in Taiwan studying, is later duped by her boyfriend who is delivering a package to a dealer. When he gets killed, Lucy ended up being an unwilling mule. She and other mules have drugs seen into their abdominal cavities. Unlike the rest, she gets kicked and the drugs are released into her body, unleashing a phenomenal potential. She developed powers of the mind which she never used: telekinesis, magnetism, mind reading, etc. Whenever the percentage of her brain is used, the more her humanity seems to be leaving her. When she contacted the professor(Freeman), she demonstrates the potential ability of the drugs that enhances her mind. Making her a genius beyond her wildest dreams. The action is fantastic and phenomenal, I can understand the mind of what it can do. I tend to stay away from people who have limited imagination. Just think. Albert Einstein got nothing on 'Lucy'.

Final Destination," Cheating death is not a game!
","Beating the inevitable is always a game that could either go one way or the other. Cheating death is a possibility that can either help you or hurt you. In either way, your screwed! These characters missed a plane trip to Paris, France lead to a disaster that no one else could understand, except for Alex(Devon Sawa, of 'Idle Hands'). Alex invisioned a tragedy about to strike, and the only one who could understand him is Clear Rivers(Ali Lauter). Carter(Kerr Smith) is a complete hothead, and he thinks he's immune to this whole charade. 'Carter, this is real, so WAKE UP!' His girlfriend Terry(Amanda Detmer) met her end to a bus, and everyone else die in a certain fashion that is unusually predictable to death that is. Avoiding death is unlikely impossible, but cheating death is more dangerous than that. Both Clear and Alex were the fighters in the movie who got advice from the mortician(Tony Todd, aka The Candyman) who I think is more creepy than death itself. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",8,1,4,5 May 2005
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Oh Boy! A five-fingered slasher!
","While Jason Voorhes a Neanderthal, Freddy Krueger(Robert Englund) is a total nutshell in the making. Unlike Friday the 13th, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' gives a whole new meaning of slasher films. Some of the scenes got some getting use to at times, I like the part where Johnny Depp's character gets electrocuted in his water-bed. I know electricity and water don't mix, but in a nightmare like this one, it gives a whole new meaning that you don't get electrocutes in baths and pools, but in a water-bed? Get real! Heather Langenkemp role as Nancy will always forever be memorable. The phone scene where my brother tells me was creepy, Freddy's tongue trying to reach Nancy? That'll make anyone's skin crawl. But boy can she fight back! The Freddy Krueger nursery rhyme is the most annoying thing in the movie, if you not careful, you might as well meet your end to him. I liked the movie quite a bit, the latter sequels a lot more exciting though. Enjoy the movie, while you still can! HAHAHAHA!!! Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",7,0,0,27 February 2006
The Matrix," The one that started it all!
","This is the ultimate of ultimate scifi movies! Here you got the hero named Neo, a computer hacker who is tracked down by a relentless villain named Smith. The scary part when Smith put this 'bug' that entered Neo's navel, and the team had to track it and flush him out. Then you have this leader named Morpheus(Fishburne) who teaches Neo the ways of the warrior. I liked the training scene where Morpheus and Neo learn Wing-chun and the way they defy gravity was just awesome. And the speed, it's just phenomenal, I'm at complete loss of words for that. I liked the part where Neo evades the bullets being fired by Smith. And the way Smith moved was just unbelievable.The fighting scene is the best part of the movie, and the reason why I liked it is because it's not your typical scifi movie you'll ever see. With a great cast like that who wants to make changes? Your only quest is to find out what is The Matrix? 5 STARS!",10,1,3,3 March 2005
Casino," Life's a gamble!
","Running a casino is a very risky job. You'll make friends, you make enemies, you'll meet all sorts of characters. Robert De Niro plays Sam, a no-nonsense casino owner who will not tolerate any outside hustle. They take no guff in spotting a cheater. I like the part where the crew tortures one of the cheaters with the ball peen hammer to his hand. Joe Pesci is always at his best at playing a hot-headed ruffian. He seems to be the kind of person who don't tolerate disrespect. He takes out anyone, at anytime, anywhere. He's the problem solver so to say. Both DeNiro and Pesci are back as a team again since 'Goodfellas', only this time it's mob free. However, Pesci's character is a lot shadier. So when he gets cut off, he goes berserk and tries to off him. He had to learn the hard way, on who his 'friends' were when he and his brother were taken out in the cornfield and was whacked. Great movie great cast. Sharon Stone was at her best, James Woods was great, Don Rickles was neat. Enjoy this piece of work, because life's a gamble in Sin City!5 stars!",10,1,2,24 July 2009
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Outstanding!
","This is one sci-fi movie that is an absolute keeper! Star Wars is a gem. The characters, the plot, the technology, and the special effects really put you in a total state of awe. Here you have a walking tyrant named Darth Vader, a human iron lung who has a strong craving for power. He uses the mystical power known as The Force to get get anything in his will. The Force choke is wicked! Then you have Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill), a simple farm boy who wants to go to the academy, then he and his uncle purchased some droids that have some important information to an old Jedi named Ben 'Obi-Wan' Kenobi(Alec Guinness), who has kept a light-saber from his old student Anakin Skywalker(Darth Vader). I liked the scene where Luke, Han Solo(Harrison Ford), and Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) took out the StormTroopers. Then there's the Death Star battle. A real gem. When they showed the extra scenes later in the years, it's worth the watch even more! The commercials, the ads, the toys, the movie isn't a hit without them, and George Lucas will get kudos from me! 5 Stars!",10,6,12,9 March 2007
Fantastic Four," My favorite quotes are FLAME ON! & IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!
","This movie was not all hoopla! The Fantastic Four has come, and they are fighting evil! The entire cast for this movie was excellent! Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic Jessica Alba as Susan Storm aka The Invisible Girl Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm aka The Thing And Chris Evans as Johnny Storm aka The Human Torch. What do you get? The Fantastic Four! These heroes were seemingly reluctant to accept this gift, except for Johnny of course. He seems to handle the situation very well. He is cocky, but cool in many ways, just like in the comics. Michael Chiklis known for roles and shows like 'The Commish' and 'The Shield' is perfect for playing The Thing. He may look like a freak show, but he has the strength, and the attitude to back it up. Jessica Alba was very hot in 'Dark Angel' , in FF she's even hotter as Susan Storm. I remember in one issue when The Invisible Woman wore a very revealing costume, in the movie everyone knows she's even hotter, visible or invisible! HAHAHAHA!!! Ioan Gruffudd done excellent as Reed. Not much to say about his other works, but it's a 10 for me. Julian McMahon know for the role as a plastic surgeon in 'Nip/Tuck' matched his role as the dreaded Dr. Victor Von Doom. Depite the few changes in the movie, I liked it very well. Wasn't like the other Marvel Comics based movies I've seen. It was very worth my while, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. The one power I would have is The Thing's super strength. I would charge through any barricade saying: IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!! Rating 5 stars!",10,5,7,16 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The plot gets deeper!
","After destroying the Death Star, the heroes set off into another adventure where the try to destroy the empire created by the menacing Dart Vader(David Prowse). When Luke Skywalker is on Planet Hoth, it would quite resemble Antartica in a way. The Tauntauns are the fine animals that would endure the harsh cold there. And the Wampas are so fierce they would catch any victim off guard. Luke Jedi instincts paid off against the Wampa. I liked th part where Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) snickers at Han Solo(Harrison Ford) where Princess Leia Organa(Carrie Fisher) tells him off. There were a lot more characters in the movie, too long to list, but I know that in the swamp scene, where Yoda teaches Luke more about the Force. And getting that X-wing fighter jet out of the swamp needed more work. Then there's the battle between Vader and Skywalker. That fight scene would take the storyline further and further to the truth of Anakin Skywalker; Luke's father! This movie has a lot to show, and it's just as fun as the fourth one. Which I thought was the first. Still, I enjoyed this all the way through. 5 Stars!",10,0,1,3 March 2007
The Breakfast Club," Here's one for the memory books!
","Meeting total strangers for the first time will not only make an impact for themselves, but for the rest of their lives. 'The Breakfast Club' is a movie where five teens from different worlds meet in weekend detention, and what a difference it makes for each and single one. You got Brian(Anthony Michael Hall); a brainiac, Andy(Emilio Estevez); a jock, Claire(Molly Ringwald); a beauty, Allison(Ally Sheedy); a shy girl, and there's John(Judd Nelson) a rebel. Each one has their way of life, how things run in the house, and furthermore, they build a bond. At first, everyone except Allison are getting to know one another, however John always being the 'bad seed', seems to love trouble. I like the part where he tried to escape, only to fall through the ceiling and into the men's room. Then I liked the part where John looked up Claire's skirt while he was trying to hide from Principal Vernon(Paul Gleason). When Allison is made over, she gets the jock, and John gets Claire, too bad for Brian, however, I bet he's too busy for girls. When John gets one of Claire's earrings, the question is, Will he change his ways? I love this movie and the 'Brat Pack' put an impact in the 80's. The music is the tops in my opinion. 5 stars.

The Wedding Singer," The 80's. What a decade!
","The 80's, you name it, I lived in it. The hair, the music, the clothes, and the dances. The music is really the big deal there. 1985 is major then. This movie combines romance, comedy, and most of all the music hits of the time. Adam Sandler plays Robbie Hart, a wedding singer who gets stood up on his own wedding. Drew Barrymore plays Julia Sullivan, a wedding caterer who plans to get married to a successful man who happened to be 'Mr. Wrong'. Robbie(Sandler) sings to couples at the reception, when he got stood up, he wants to make their lives just as miserable as his. I liked the part where he she goes off on his bride-to-be. But when she tries to make it up, he came to his senses. His grandmother is very kind, and that meatball holding, I think its cute. She really took it down when she did 'Rapper's Delight' when she renewed her vows. Billy Idol made a great cameo when he helped fix Julia's player fiancé Glen Gulia(Matt Glave). What a loser! Love works in mysterious ways, and the results are usually great. It's a gemstone out of all of Adam Sandler's movies. It's a must have and a must see. 3 out of 5 stars!",8,0,2,6 December 2006

","Fans of scifi and comedy will love this movie. Here you have a young slacker named Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) who meets this crackpot scientist Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd) who builds a time machine out of a DeLorean: America's Flop Car that'll remain memorable in this movie. Spoofed off H.G. Wells 'Time Machine' 'BTTF' is memorable all the way. Meeting your folks would be fun, but tampering with the past is not a game. Marty has to learn that hard. I liked the parts where he meets his father in the diner, and watch his future wife undress. Marty knew his father was a 'peeping tom' when he was younger. Then trying to make a difference in their lives was the big part from keeping him and his siblings from non-existence was a bigger challenge. When everything was restored, Marty's finally changed for the better, though he introduced the skateboarding craze which one of the kids were amazed completely. Sticking to the dreams is important, listening to Dr. Brown is a must. Robert Zemeckis is a genius, and he really put up a solid cast and characters for the movie. The music rocks!

When Henry Hill(Ray Liotta) decide to join the mob, he would get an offer he couldn't refuse. All the racketeer, the murder, the mayhem, these Goodfellas are the ones who could do it. They would make all these other gangsters look like amateurs. My father would hang around these neighborhoods when he was working for the NYPD. He encountered a mobster one and made it out fine. Then drugs went into the fray, and the downfall begins. Joe Pesci's character Tommy DeVito was such a potty-mouth, he kills a young man for messing up, at the end, he gets his just desserts. Then Hill rounds up the people he worked for. And in that courtroom, it was in your face action. A great movie, highly compelling, and it would be great to hear more from my father, he's been there! In the 1970's that is. Rating 5 stars.",10,0,1,20 May 2006
Beetlejuice," It's Showtime!
","Whoever heard of a ghost whose name sounds like a very nasty bug drink? It's 'Beetlejuice'! The Ghost with the most. Of what? Fun, surprises, and plenty of gags that will keep you rolling. Here you have a couple who have perished in a car crash, go back to the house they were living at is now being tenanted by the Deets. There are nice, but fashionably challenged. They have a daughter named Lydia(Winona Ryder), who happened to be a little bit rebellious. The real deal here is that specter who can evict the most obnoxious tenant ever. His name is Beetlejuice. He is one rude, crude, and effect ghost you could ever find. However, the dead couple finds him very revolting. When he kicks the model tree and crudely compliments it, he 'honks his horn'. They try to get rid of the Deets, but to no avail. They weren't scary enough. The only effective thing is when the played Harry Belafonte's 'Day-O'. It was totally hilarious. Especially when the prawns became hands. Beetlejuice turned up the heat when he took on the Deets. And when he says, 'It's Showtime!', he really means it. Very funny, and lots of gags, this movie got it all. 4 out of 5 stars!",9,1,3,28 June 2007
The Wizard of Oz," A superb classic!
","Who would ever think of a fantasy that would leave an impression that would last for a lifetime? Well, Victor Fleming made 'The Wizard of Oz' with a cast that would make a successful movie happen. Judy Garland as the ever impressionable Dorothy Gale really makes it sparkle with her sly wit and sultry voice. And that footwork with those ruby slippers, very graceful. Ray Bolger, another great dancer. Looks great as the goofy Hunk, and his role as The Scarecrow. Man that takes a lot of talent I really like that. Jack Haley, really good play both Hickory and The Tin Woodsman he had a lot of guts to help the others in distress despite having no heart. Bert Lahr as Zeke and The Cowardly Lion now that's a riot! 'Put 'em Up!' Put 'Em Up!' Why he's supposed to be the 'King of the Jungle' now he's The 'Chicken of the Jungle'. Pure encouragement is what each one needed. The bronze screen beginning is really cool, who needed that black & white format? And the character that really made my blood boil is that dirty old Miss Gulch(Margaret Hamliton). She was bad to the county, and Dorothy was right, she is nothing but a mean old witch! Especially when Dorothy was in that tornado and saw everyone she knew. She killed the Wicked Witch of the East with the house, the Munchkins thank her. She used water on The one of the West, the guards thanked her. I guess Oz owed her a debt of gratitude, I guess she is welcomed to Oz at anytime! This movie is a surefire classic, and it is great for the whole family. Which in fact it really is! Rating 5 stars!

Dodgeball," For the winner in all of us!
","This movie has got more cameos than anything else I've see. Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are at it again. Only this time the roles are reversed. In 'Starsky & Hutch' Vaughn was the villain and Stiller was the hero. In Dodgeball, it's the other way around. Vaughn plays Peter Lafleur, a gym owner who's down on his luck, and Stiller plays White Goodman a gym owner who rules his with an iron fist. Both gyms will compete in a dodgeball competition, when Average Joe's Gy gets a lesson in attitude, Global Gym puts the 'p' in Pain! With all the cameos in this movie, no wonders it's a riot. William Shatner, Chuck Norris giving Average Joe's the nod, David Hasselhoff speaking German. He has spent time there being a singing sensation there. It's funny when he ridiculed the entire team for losing the competition. And most of all, it goes to show what White really was in the beginning of his life: A big fat loser! Great movie, greater cast, this movie really will make a big winner out of you! 3 out of 5 stars!",8,0,1,10 August 2008
V for Vendetta," V is for Victorious! Vivacious! And most of all, Vindincating!
","There's never been a movie I have ever seen that would turn out the way it did. 'V for Vendetta' is bold, vivid, graphic, and settling all at the same time. Natalie Portman is excellent in everything she does. Playing Evey is not bad. Her British is at top notch. The beginning is very good, and I thought it would be to plain at first. In her other movies, she was always bold in every one of them. In the beginning, she looks more naive than bold. Just wait later on. She even pulled a 'Demi' in this movie, and the confinement scenes were played out beautifully. Hugo Weaving did an outstanding job as 'V', the man behind the mask. And that Guy Hawkes mask is forever embedded in my mind. The poetic lyrics, the subtle lines of all the classics(books) intrigued me more than the action. And the fight scenes were very fascinating as well. The daggers were my favorites weapons. They were more like giant switchblades. And that body armor he wore did more protecting that a Kevlar vest ever would. V was very prepared! This movie was worth the wait and the watch, I know London will recover from the chancellor's evil, and the torch will be passed to others who believe. 'V for Vendetta' is the new all time hit of 2006. Enjoy it while you can. 5 stars!",10,1,5,17 March 2006
The Island," Interesting!
","Always wanting to live life by yourself? That's what these clones think in the movie 'The Island'. Lincoln Six Echo(Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta(Scarlett Johannson) are clones who uncover a deep secret of the facility they are living in. Lincoln Six Echo is claimed to be a survivor of some holocaust in the 21st Century. But when he discovers a moth coming from the ventilation shaft, his curiosity makes him wonder about the surrounding at the facility he's in. The clones are harvested in this artificial embryo which reminds me of that movie 'Embryo'. People of that facility are anxious to win to get on the 'Island'. However, these 'winners' are actually 'pawns' in the game. They are nothing but 'human cattle' in a 'utopian-style ranch'. When Licoln finds out himself, both he and Jordan get out, and fight for survival. With all the futuristic vehicles around, the adventure is just the beginning. The dreams, the Picasso painting, and the visual effects really bring this movie to life. I liked all the stunts, the twists, and turns. And I like also the characters as well. A very fun movie to watch. Rating 3 .5 out of 5 stars.",8,0,0,22 October 2006
The Godfather," Lengthy? YES! Boring? NO! Entertaining? OH YES! That's an offer I won't refuse!
","A fine movie about the mafia in the day really have its advantages. They say that blood is thicker than water, that is no joke. Mario Puzo's 'The Godfather' is a real masterpiece of fine art and work of generations of mobsters. Marlon Brando does a spectacular job playing Don Vito Corleone. This mob boss doesn't play around, even though he has a bull's eye painted on him. My mom has seen this movie before I came to the world, and I had to see it first on my own time, and she was right, it is good. The real kicker is when that mobster had one of his Clydedale's head in his bed, and freaks out indefinitely. That scene is a classic, makes a horror movie look corny. And that scene where 'The Turk'(Al Lettieri) gets pumped in a restaurant, amazing! The ambushing, the seduction, and the loyalty turn to double-cross is all there in this movie. I know this is long, but it'll be worth your while. I adore great work despite all the violence. The cast is great, and if read the book, or any of his books, consider yourself loyal. Rating 5 stars!",10,1,4,23 May 2006
