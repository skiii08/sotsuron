Casablanca," One of the greatest films of all time
","The beauty of Casablanca is it's respect for the English language. The writing is near perfect and fits the actors wonderfully. It's an education in the evolution of the language and the paucity of the American style. Besides the writing, Bogart makes the film. He too is a quintessentially American character. This is a film about American culture and values.",10,1,1,9 August 2000
