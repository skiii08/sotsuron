Vertigo," Where to begin?
","I did not find much wrong with this movie, but there was not much right. I thought that the first half was tremendous. It was there that the movie fell. The sudden plot twist helped lift it back on its feet for what I thought was a stunning conclusion. I would not call it the greatest, but I would not call it the worst. I did especially like Jimmy Stewart. He played his role very well, especially in the third act. It was very enjoyable and I look forward to viewing it again.",8,1,4,14 November 1998
12 Angry Men," I'm not angry with 12 Angry Men
","Sidney Lumet's first film is one of his best. Of course, it helps to have people like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, and Ed Begley. It's great because you never know the names of the any of the jurors until the end. When you see this one, watch for the opening shot. It continues for I don't know how long. Its amazing how you are kept glued to the screen throughout, despite the fact that they never leave the juror room and they continue talking and talking. Yet, it fascinates you. At the beginning, you don't know a thing about the case. In the end you  know every little detail. It may bore some, but I sure liked it.",10,1,2,14 August 1998
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Pleasant Surprise
","I had seen The Phantom Menace, and not particularly liked it. I had heard the terrible title, Attack of the Clones. I had heard that it was bogged down by a love story. So it came as a pleasant surprise when I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.There are many jokes and plotlines that are easily understandable with a basic knowledge of the first trilogy. And in true Star Wars style, it wastes no time in getting right into the story, so a re-viewing of Phantom Menace may be needed.It pays off. The characters here are very well-defined, even when not very likable. The special effects are up to par with Menace as well. It's amazing how Lucas can create even more alien species (even if he does borrow a bit from A.I.). It's still the fight sequences, though, that make this movie. Yoda is a delight and the battle sequence with all the Jedis is remarkable.I already can't wait for Episode 3.",8,0,0,16 May 2002
Duck Soup," A Duck Soup never tasted so good
","There really is nothing I have to say that hasn't already been said. I do believe that more of the Marx Brothers would be good. They were outstanding ! The dance scene announcing war is hilarious! You can call them many names, like great, brilliant, outstanding, but 'I still like upstart the best!'",10,0,1,27 August 1998
