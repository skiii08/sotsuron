Kill Bill: Vol. 2," More story than gory. Thanks
","I enjoyed this film much more than the needlessly gratuitous Vol 1.  While Vol 1 had some great scenes, in hindsight it only serves to create a motivational backstory for the anti-hero played by Thurman. One could spend a few sentences to summarize Vol 1 to a friend (who has not seen it) then direct them to Vol 2 to the same story told better.
If Vol 1 had the too-narrow focus on bloody revenge, then Vol 2 is the belated payoff to QT's fans who hoped he would create a tale with more feeling, like he did with Pulp Fiction.I felt Vol 2 expertly drew me into the narrative through the same use of gritty visuals as Vol 1, but was more successful because it used suspense more than comically-graphic spurts of arterial blood.  Vol 2 played upon fears of the dark, closed spaces and helplessness, all while interjecting the humanity of family in the form of a wedding then later a mother's love for a child.  I was able to relate more to Vol 2 because it's satire content used family concepts that I am familiar with.While Vol 1 was still fun ride that alternately caused me to grimace and gag, or blink in startled amusement, or chuckle with guilty pleasure at the violence, Vol 2 is the pay-off that removes the guilt and lays out a human story told in the wonderfully absurd Tarrentino tradition.",10,0,1,18 April 2004
