About Time," This love story tells you how important your time is.
","IT is a love story with a small element of science fiction. It describes the love of normal girl and a man who is capable of travelling in time.What is interesting to me is that the whole life story of the couple goes through in the drama. Beginning from their impressive encounter, it portrays how they get along with, get married and have a family. However, what makes a difference from any other popular love story is that the story goes back and forward because of the ability of time-travel. It makes it possible that the story get complicated and excited. Furthermore, as the title implies, it gives out the message of the preciousness of time. Observing the development of love between them, you'll figure out the value of time because it never goes back and forward in the real life unlike the case of the drama. In short, it is not the simple story which entertains you from the aspect of love, but the one that conveys the philosophical message to the audience.",8,1,1,24 July 2016
