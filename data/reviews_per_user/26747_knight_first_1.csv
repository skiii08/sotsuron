Conquest 1453," what (!) UlubatlÄ± Hasan had bastards (??)
","is this film about ancient turks , our ancestors or is it about conan the barbarian. Faith Sultan Mehmet is in the supporting male actor and Hasan is the lead actor in this film. Not only a leading actor, a dishonest pervert actor as well. historian wrote nothing about him having bastards. He known to be the first soldier to have the flag on the top of the tower, that's it. What pervert scenerio is this, making him fornicate. this is not history, this is a sex novel. didn't the producers consult a historian about his life or his wearings. he is dressed like conan the barbarian. with naked arms and hairy naked chest like a stripper. this can only be a subject for TV series, can not be a movie. and the director should be banned from directing. the film has not focused on sultan mehmet's character and portrayed the character wrong. dead wrong. whoever approved this has no idea abut the siege and its characters. don't go to this film. buy jason momoa's conan the barbarian. at least you will see some decent visual effects. this film ruined my day. honestly. 1 is too much vote for the director.",1,35,84,21 February 2012
