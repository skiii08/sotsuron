Casablanca," Truly a Work of Art
","This movie definitely lives up to all of it's hype. Casablanca is a movie that is famous all around the world for its iconic love story, but few people talk about the political message that the movie sends. In a time of despair for the nation, this movie was made to show hope for the loyal citizens. This movie showed that there was a light at the end of the dark tunnel that people were living in. The love story definitely adds to the effect and serves as a distraction from the overall message. The use of light in this movie adds to the way it is perceived. In many of the dramatic scenes, the entire room is dark except for a light that shines perfectly on the face of the actor in frame. The lights not only add to the beauty of the actors themselves, but adds to the drama in the movie. Casablanca is a work of art that served as a distraction in more than one way for people during a time of great stress.",9,0,1,28 November 2015
Patton," Unlike Any Other War Movie I've Seen
","This movie is unlike any other war movie I've seen. This movie tells the story of what happens behind the scenes in the war. The story line is way ahead of its time. This film also shines a light on the internal struggles that soldiers were facing outside of the obvious battles they were fighting in the war. This movie also shines a light on General Patton, on man who might be fighting the hardest battle of all. This is a great film, because it shows the humor that people were trying to use in some scenes that would get their minds off of the inevitable war that was happening. General Patton knew how he was viewed by others and he didn't care.",8,5,5,16 December 2015
Annie Hall," Best Movie Ever
","At the very beginning of the movie, I fell in love instantly with Woody Allen's character with his opening monologue. The idea of the film telling the story backward seems like a spoiler, but it actually keeps you more engaged. Diane Keaton's role as Annie Hall seems to be perfectly fit for her. This film truly depicts what a modern romance is like. Very awkward and uncomfortable. Annie Hall is a woman that every woman can identify with, and Alvy is a man that every man can identify with. Both of these characters are perfectly imperfect in every way. This movie gives hope to every average person that hopes to fall in love someday. Woody Allen is simply a genius.",10,0,0,15 December 2015
The Graduate," Great Film
","Besides the fact that the soundtrack to this movie is one of the best that I've ever heard, this movie is a perfect depiction of the age gap that was felt during the late 60's. Although this movie seems to move a little fast toward the end, it shows that kids those days simply made decisions to make them, without thinking about the long-term consequences that they would face. Hoffman's monotone voice throughout the whole film adds to the mystery that he is trying to depict in his character. The music in this film fits perfectly with every scene that it is in. The cast members in this film seem to have been born for their roles. This is a film that I had heard great things about, and was truly excited to see for myself. It definitely lives up to its expectations.",9,1,1,15 December 2015
Singin' in the Rain," A Musical Unlike Other Musicals
","This musical is one that is unlike any other. Even a person who does not like musicals would love this movie. Most of the musical numbers are written to almost make fun of other musicals, while resulting in a film that was way ahead of it's time. The choreography in this film is an art in itself. Gene Kelly fills the part of Don Lockwood like no other could. To this day, 'Singin' in the Rain' is a musical number that is known everywhere. The dedication that all of these actors showed while this film was in progress is truly remarkable. This one of the earliest films in color and the color in it is almost better than the color that is in movies now. It is very pure and very vibrant so it adds to the overall effect of the movie.",10,0,2,28 November 2015
Psycho," Great Movie
","If you only ever see one Alfred Hitcock movie in your lifetime, make it Psycho. This film has the perfect elements that every horror films has. What makes this movie more scary is that it is something that could potentially happen in real life. The most famous scene in the movie, the shower scene, is just as good in the film as it is in every promo it has ever been in. The montage that Hitchcock created is truly iconic. I truly admire that fact that Hitchcock also puts little bits of ridiculousness into the film, so that the audience does not get too scared, and it reminds them that it is just a movie. This movie inspired spin-off TV series', and has appeared in countless places, and now I understand why. Truly a great film.",8,0,1,16 December 2015
