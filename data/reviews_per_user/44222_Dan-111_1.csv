Alien 3," Warning! This film is a travesty
","I went into Alien 3 hoping for a continuation of the story line. Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop, with courage and daring, had triumphed in Aliens, and ended up in frozen sleep and returning to civilization.  But, holding courage in disdain, the writers decide to immediately kill of 3 of the 4 survivors of the previous film. As outrageous as this was, they also decide to have the alien 'rape' Ripley in her cryo-sleep, thereby negating every victory won with such blood, sacrifice and difficulty in the previous film. From there on, it gets worse. Dark and depressing, this film should never have been written, let alone made. Do yourself a favor and end this series with #2.  Alien 3 is one sick film.",1,34,67,30 May 1999
