Ford v Ferrari," Excellent movie and a motivational story!
","Watched the movie two times, the second time i couldn't watch the ending...
Based on the true story Leo Beebe's official reason to convince Ford about that ending picture was that he was affraid the three cars might crash into eachother while striving for the 1st place... and he being responsable for the investment had to do something about it... sounds like a charlatan to me...his family should be ashamed of his actions! and corporatists aswell...
McLaren took the prize even know he knew it didn't belong to him! which is a big blow to his reputation...The movie is excellent, you can see they invested alot of love into the picture, everything is so well glued together!
Matt Damon's performance is flawless, Christian Bale does a great job impersonating this rather odd character.It's not just a random story, it's also a moral message to the younger generation!",9,2,2,9 January 2020
Joker," A sequel may actualy be it!
","'This movie should remain as it is because pushing it may actualy take away from it's authenticity'
Well... that feels true, the movie is as much as it can be at this moment, but why run away from it?... i don't think that's it for Joaquin! not even close! Joker is a perfect glove for Joaquin and i think this was just a glimpse of what Joaquin can do as Joker!!!A sequel would be an epic challenge for the director (or directors) as for Joaquin he can shine trough Joker like no other... he may actualy be able to give us the greatest antagonist of all time!
The Joker doesn't have to be this sad funny clown all the time, Joaquin could bring out some of the deeper feelings the Joker may have!!!I don't believe it's the time but i do believe it can make alot of sense!",9,2,7,19 December 2019
