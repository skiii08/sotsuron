The Blair Witch Project," It sucked. It is exploitation. It is a stunt. It is crap.
","I was so looking forward to The Blair Witch Project, due to all the 'buzz' from film festivals, and from Roger Ebert.  I had to buy a ticket a day in advance to get to see it here in Houston.  The seating line was around the block, and the theater was packed.The movie started out well enough, but by the halfway point I was beginning to see the movie as just ... depressing.  Then morbid.  Then pointless. And to top it off, the movie has no conclusion.  Even Alien had a point.  Even The Texas Chainsaw Massacre had a satisfying conclusion.  Same with Halloween.This movie is nothing but exploitation--at or below the level of Friday the 13th.  There is no sense of good versus evil, no sense of meaning.  There is no depiction of human courage in the face of fear.  There are just demoralizing depictions of human depravity and hopelessness.Don't go.  You're a mindless wonder if you like this movie.  And you probably watch Fox's 'Worlds Most Amazing Car Crashes,' too.",Null,1,3,18 July 1999
Velvet Goldmine," Style in search of substance.
","The movie is absorbing, for all its images and tableaux, but in the end it wants for a plot.What's more, I could discern no clear meaning from what little story there was.  It was more like an extended music video than anything else, yet it was less sensible than most music videos.The movie does have something to say about the righteousness of rebelling against a sexually fascist society (read: homophobia).  And it is largely pleasantly engrossing and deeply moody, at times almost hypnotic--again, like a music video.  I am put in the mind of the 'Don't just sing it--be it' sequence at the end of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.However, I can't recommend the film very highly, because it was neither documentary, nor true-story, nor (real) music-concert, forms which could conceivably have excused the lack of a coherent story.(6/10)",Null,1,1,8 November 1998
