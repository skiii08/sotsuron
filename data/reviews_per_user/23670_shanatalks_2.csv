Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch Sucks
","Full review posted at shanatalks.wordpress.comThe title of the movie fits it. I can't say anything else. It sucks.I had high expectations with this movie. I first saw its trailer and I got interested. The graphics of the movie was awesome. The action scenes were breathtaking. The girls were sexy and lethal. But I shouldn't have watch it. It was a waste of time.The storyline sucks.Since the movie's cinematography was great, I really thought I'll enjoy the film. I love action flick movies and I love it more if the leads are bad ass women. I endured 30 minutes of watching the film intently but when the action scenes were only shown when the freakin' girl started to dance, all of my interest were thrown out the window. I understood what they want the characters to do or what they had to change or obtain. I just don't get why they had to show it through imaginary fighting scenes. The action scenes don't make sense. It was rather a distraction.It seems that the producers were thorn between creating a dramatic- disturding-film or an action-sci-fi-flick so they decided to mix both and the result was awesomely disastrous.The main character's acting didn't even help. It sucks too. I probably can rant continuous of the negative, ugly things I've seen in movie but I'll just give you guys one advice; don't watch it.Ugh. It sucks. It sucks. It sucks!Okay, obviously my word for the day is sucks. Sorry. I can't help it. I was really disappointed with this movie.",Null,0,3,12 November 2011
Burlesque," Burlesque: Just another Musical Movie
","Full review posted at shanatalks.wordpress.comWhen I heard that Cher and Christina Aguilera will team up for a movie, I initially thought 'What the heck? Is this another Glitter or Crossroads?' Both movies didn't make it to the box office and I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only person who thinks both movies sucks. Those pop icons turned actress should have stuck with their forte—singing.I never really had any expectations when I watched the movie, so I hesitantly bought the DVD and after watching it—I'm singing 'yeah, yeah, yeah'.To be honest, Burlesque is not the best musical movie I watched (compared with Phantom of the Opera) but I can say it's not a bad movie either. I must admit it; I was not impressed with the movie's story because it's too common. A girl wants to make her dreams come true so she left her hometown, moved to the big city with no one else to turn to. She did find a place to call her own, found friends, family and a partner. Then she lives happily ever after. Very familiar? You bet it is.Though the movie's screenplay was pretty weak, I can say that the music used for the movie compensated what's lacking from its screenplay. The movie has strong numbers and there are songs that really made its mark to the movie goers. I loved Cher's performance of 'You Haven't Got The Best of Me' and Christina's 'Show Me How to Burlesque' number. I kept singing the line 'Let me hear you say, yeeaah!' for hours. The movie did give me LSS (Last Song Syndrome).I really don't know if I can recommend this movie to everyone but if you're just looking for a movie that can entertain you and for you to pass the time; Burlesque is not a bad choice. If you love Broadway music, you'd certainly enjoy watching this; However, if you're the movie goer that won't settle for anything less, forget watching this movie.",Null,1,3,12 November 2011
