Stop-Loss," I'd rather be watching Breach
","I gave this movie a 2 solely for the effort they exerted to try and disguise this propaganda as a movie. I'll explain. Most folks, when they enlist in the Armed Forces, sign up for 8 years. You heard me correctly: usually 4 Active Duty, then 4 in the IRR. With that said, the very premise of this movie is ridiculous. This movie is about as accurate as 'Basic' was. The only thing these two movies have in common with reality is they make occasional references to actual places. That's it. After watching this movie, I've surmised that, upon returning from deployment, everyone has their fianc√© leave them, gets a DWI, or becomes a fugitive. I'm so uplifted. I have such confidence in our men and women in uniform now. Jeeze... All in all, this is one you can definitely skip. I don't know who directed it, but after watching it, I assume it was Michael Moore. I know it isn't a documentary and wasn't meant to be one, but what was the purpose of putting those numbers up at the end right before the credits? It reminded me of 'Blood Diamonds'. If you're going to connect actual events to this fictitious story, what's the motive? My guess: 'to expose a grave injustice that's going on as we speak.' Be sure to read that last line with a snooty, self-important tone to get the intended effect. I'll end by saying: 1. Did anyone FORCE our men and women to sign the enlistment papers? 2. Is it common practice for people to sign contracts without reading them, or is the movie implying that all soldiers are too stupid to read? 3. Doesn't everyone know by now that America is engaged in a 'War on Terror', and wouldn't it be obvious to anyone enlisting that, just perhaps, enlisting could lead to deployment? 4. When did serving your country become a bad thing? 5. Why did Hollywood make this piece of trash into a movie? This movie sucked more than Paris Hilton.",2,4,9,9 August 2008
