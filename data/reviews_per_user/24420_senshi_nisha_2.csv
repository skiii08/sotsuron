The Avengers," Enjoyment does not equal quality
","I wasn't intending to write a review about The Avengers because I consider it to be one of those movies with a life spawn equal to it's running time.After the credits roll it's 'out of sight,out of mind' for me.But seeing the praise this mediocre movie gets in most reviews and how it has managed to hit top 50 with an average of 8.7 I felt the need to even up the balance a little.First of all ,I want to say it is OK to enjoy/like/love any movie.But before claiming it to be 'the best thing ever' take a moment to think if enjoyment and quality actually overlap.I can guess why The Avengers is so popular:-it has a cast of well-known,loved actors. -it's a comic book adaptation.-it's path has been paved by 4 prequels(without the Hulk movies) -it features a team of 6 superheroes so everyone can take his pick.-it's a light-hearted movie.-it's an action-oriented movie with flamboyant special effects.-it's targeted at the most impressionable audience:children and teenagers.Having all these ingredients the movie only had to play safe in order to be a box office success.I must congratulate the producers for perfectly anticipating and manipulating the public's expectations.Because people are indeed claiming The Avengers to be the pinnacle of super hero movies.Seriously,people? As much as I dislike Batman I still consider The Dark Knight to be way more deserving of this title.However there seems to be an overall consensus that The Avengers had brilliant,amazing,like never seen before action and humor.I must ask you,have you had your memory deleted when you entered the cinema?It's true that the movie doesn't screw up in a blatant way, and has an enjoyment factor due to the reasons I've enumerated earlier, but it consists undoubtedly of the same old clichÃ©s which are endlessly used and reused in super-hero/action movies:The bad guy threatens Earth->heroes are gathered to defeat him->they don't get along->the bad guy gives them a little beating->now they get along->the bad guy is defeated by the heroes.And guess where the final fight takes place?Manhattan Island.And guess what the government does without knowing the outcome of the battle?Tries to nuke the island.But let's forget the plot.Action movies almost never bother with it.Let's talk about the battles.Choreography and imagination were almost absent.At times it felt like watching a turn based fighting game.And when that huge metal worm made it's entrance I really thought they will fight it together using some cool combos, but no,Hulk simply punched it in the face.And there was an interval of several minutes during which Loki was absent from the final battle.But he was probably busy commanding his army,too bad his troops were randomly flying around,uncoordinated and without using any tactics.Maybe some BGMs would've helped the battle scenes a little, but the OST war rather shy. Not much is to be said about the characters,each have one or two defining traits(excepting Loki maybe) and that's pretty much it.The dialogue is shallow,consisting of cheesy one liners and typical lame jokes.Maybe this movie has your favorite superhero, maybe you're a big fan of the comics, maybe you ship Captain America and Iron Man or you have fantasies with Loki ,maybe you liked the 3-D ,but think before rating this movie a 9 or a 10.",4,10,23,16 May 2012
Thor," Very bad
","I personally would've liked to see an adaptation faithful to the Norse mythology ,but since the movie is based on a comic book( which has a more 'eccentric' approach on the matter)I could've come to terms with the magical alien stretch had the concept been well executed.Sadly, even the word 'average' is a height this movie can only dream of.Story Heir to a throne is immature and not yet worthy of it.He is stripped of power and privileges and banished.By finding love he rediscovers himself,grows up and becomes worthy of the said throne. I do not ask for originality every time I watch a movie,especially not from super hero movies ,but when I watch a movie and I can predict everything that will happen, including the characters' lines ,then something is wrong with that movie. And this is exactly the case with Thor.There was no suspense in this movie,nothing to intrigue me,nothing to stir my emotions. Everything was part of an already known pattern. Another weak point in the plot's fabric is the presence of plot holes and logical inconsistencies ,a not so easy to overlook flaw ,given the fact we're not dealing with one of the most intricate stories ever told. The impression left by the plot is that of a pretext for action scenes and CGI effects.And I also want to note the humor was childish. Characters I can define the entire cast in two words:stereotypical and unidimensional. Driven by weak motivations and acting illogical the characters are just some shapeless tools used to make the plot function. The conflicts between them aren't given any depth or scope and the relationships are shallow and undeveloped. The most eloquent example is the main character,Thor. At the beginning of the movie he is portrayed as being very impulsive,immature,glory seeking,war loving,arrogant,selfish and not so intelligent. Despite all this his father is an inch close to crown him the as the next king of Asgard. I can only wonder how is it possible for someone who has been raised to become a king by a supposedly wise and kind father to act like an immature brat and be so straightforward in his stupidity.And I also have to wonder how the same father seems blind to his son personality and is ready to crown him as king. After being banished Thor's personality changes overnight and the only given explanation is the flaccid romance between him and the mortal Jane.Everything that happens between the two seems forced,existing only for the sake of having a love story which also only exists for the sake of explaining Thor's metamorphosis. And the bad acting doesn't help him at all.All his lines are said in a cheesy yet emotionless and linear manner.And I would've liked to see a more menacing,a more imposing God of Thunder,not some puppy-eyed guy with some overworked abs and pectorals.Natalie Portman shouldn't have been chosen to play Jane's role.She simply doesn't fit in this movie and I can't buy her character. The rest of the characters from the Earth side are useless and play no part in the plot. Thor's friends doesn't seem to have thoughts of their own.They're simply an extension of the main character,only being there to approve and support him. However there's one aspect of the movie I liked.Loki.Tom Hiddleston fits the role very well and his character shows some emotions and some neuronal activity although is still lacking in character development.Special Effects I'm sure this was supposed to be the movie's selling point but in my opinion not even the special effects can save this movie. The colors were nauseating ,the Asgard Kingdom seemed like a bunch of enormous buildings thrown together only for the sake of size,disregarding any sense of order and harmony. The costumes looked fake.The fight scenes were boring and lacked any kind of choreography.Soundtrack Almost non-existent.I can hardly remember it.Overall Thor,or when you sacrifice plot and character development for special effects and action scenes but you fail even at these.",3,2,6,12 September 2011
