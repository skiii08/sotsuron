Blade Runner 2049," Artsy fartsy
","This was a 2 hour, 40 minute movie that should have been an hour and a half. David Lynch couldn't have stretched this movie out any longer. If you wanna watch this, my advice is make sure you have absolutely nothing to do for three hours, loved the first movie, and have gotten at least 12 hours of sleep.",5,5,9,4 March 2018
Meet the Fockers," Juuuuuuuuuuust saw the movie, .....aaaaaaaaaaand............................
","well, it didn't suck, but was not that good. (kinda sucked) Thought I would love it and kept waiting to, ......but the credits eventually ran after almost 2 hours and i was kind of like, well, that was the movie i guess, and, now,....its ending. If you want to watch at the theater, go to the early, otherwise video or DVD it. No matter what you hear, this movie was NOT as funny as the first, not even close. One really funny scene, that frankly seemed a little forced, and that was it. As far as a story, well, they got married, .....and, they,.....were,..... married, together,..... finally, at the end. very disappointing. look for Meet the Baby or something in the next year or two, that will really really suck and make millions.",4,1,2,7 January 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," will? what have you done?
","Don't get me wrong, i think will ferrel is one of the funnest people on the planet. As a matter of fact, I really do wish I thought this movie was as funny as the rest of you, but frankly, i thought 90% of it sucked. Maybe even a little more. An hour and a half Saturday night live skit is all this was. I like will ferrell a lot, or maybe i just thought i did, but he couldn't hold this sorry excuse for a movie together, even if he can get jack black, Luke Wilson, vince vaughn, and ben stiller to try and help out by doing cameos. I should recommend this movie i guess, but only if you can get for free. If you haven't seen old school yet, try that first. At least they had a story for that one.",Null,0,0,9 July 2004
