Hereditary," Not even close to a horror movie
","Everybody talked so much about this movie and after I watched, I got to say that I am very disapointed. They said that this is the best horror movie of this year, but it's not evan a horror movie nor mystery. Very slow motion during whole movie, just a few scary scenes, bad chemistry between actors and undefined ending are main reasons for 5/10 rating. Only good thing in this movie is Toni Collette acting and funtastic make up of Milly Shapiro character.",5,1,4,17 September 2018
