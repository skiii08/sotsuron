The Blair Witch Project," Great movie!!!
","WOW!!! Great movie.  Personally I did not find myself scared because I knew it was a movie but when we left the theatre last night their were about 10 traumatized girls their that could not even open their eyes to look at the credits so scared something else was going to happen.  What makes this movie so good is that you do not have to see a skinny old one with a long nose to actually feel fear, the directors relied on letting your imagination create what the scary sounds were, unlike in the new 'the haunting' were you saw all the scary things.  The actors were great; they actual had emotions toward what was happening.  If you go and see this movie you can go in two ways in as viewing it.  One this is just movie, there is never really anything out there that is going to hurt them and you know that this people are actual still alive at this very moment.  Your result is a good movie that is quite interesting and intriguing.  Viewing two going in thinking that this was real people put yourself in their place, believing that thing was happening to you and you end up with a movie that will probably scare the $#!^ out of you. 
Closing analysis great movie worth the wait in live and worth the money.  If you know that it is just a movie then it is not that scary if you can always keep that grip on reality then you are probably going to walk out crying clinging to a friends arm and stay up half the night wondering what that sound was coming from in the living room.NeO raGe",9,1,1,1 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," This movie kicked serious a**
","How in the hell did this movie make the R rated cut surprises the hell out of me.  I saw it last week and I am still dying laughing at it.  Parker and Stone did an excellent job, and the musicals were great. If you are going to go see this you definitely must go when it is packed.  The whole theatre was singing and clapping along when Cartman was singing 'the bitch song' which made it an even better experience.  Warning though this is mainly a movie for high school seniors, college students and kids who have fake ID's. Well worth having to pay full price since I forgot to bring the college student I.D.  Racial jokes, sexual innuendos,  neverending cursing, making fun of canada, and the shooting of the most hated man in the world (not sadaam or satan) if you have seen the movie you know who I mean, and you get to see what Kenny looks like.  What more can you want in a movie",7,2,2,6 July 1999
