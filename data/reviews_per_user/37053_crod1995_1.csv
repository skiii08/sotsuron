The Equalizer," Denzel as a superhero??
","What else can I say? You like Denzel Washington? You like solid action movies? You like Denzel Washington kicking ass? Than this movie is for you. The acting....its freaking Denzel Washington Chloe Grace Moretz with the short amount of screen time she has is good in the movie but she's more of a plot point that gets Robert McCall back into this dark world, other than that she doesn't have much to do. The main villain played by Marton Csokas was entertaining to watch on screen and the interactions between him and Denzel were the best part of the film.The action in the movie is creative almost home alone like and some of it is gruesome and will make you flinch. But is the action entertaining?.. Yea for a good portion of the film it is, till you realize that Robert McCall is a superhero! I mean the man is barely touchable! It gets very predictable almost boring! Every character Mr. McCall comes up against stands no chance at all! Except one guy at the end of the movie, when you think Robert McCall found his match he kills him within a few seconds. Even when you think there's going to be a 'final awesome showdown' between him and Denzel's character it doesn't happen Robert McCall takes him out with ease. Antoine Fuqua makes a good looking film although sometimes artsy its still nice to watch. Is this film as good as his other film with Denzel Washington 'Training Day' I mean no, is it entertaining yes. If you like Denzel Washington this movie is for you. If you want to see Denzel Washington kicking ass and fairly untouchable like a superhero this movie is for you.Solid action movie.",7,1,7,1 October 2014
