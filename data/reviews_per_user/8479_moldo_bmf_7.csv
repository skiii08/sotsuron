The Incredible Hulk," You wouldn't like him when he's angry....
","FIrst off I would like to state that I do not wish for Ang Lee to be cursed for a thousand years, and the last thing I'd want would be for his soul and the souls of his next of kin to burn in hell for millennia to come. I honestly didn't think that his vision of 'The Hulk' was THAT bad. Of course, I expected more, but that doesn't mean that his movie was horrific. However, without a shadow of a doubt, Louis Leterrier's version of it was better. In many ways. First of all it picked up the action a little bit farther off than the previous movie, leaving us only with fragments of Banner's memories from when he first turned into the green beast. Instead of going into his past, Leterrier explores the present, and Banner's spiraling descent into madness, while he desperately tries to seize control and keep it. In his search for a cure he ultimately delivers an even greater danger to the world. In his search for control, he loses it hopelessly. In his search for love, he finds greater obstacles than before. But enough about that... let's move on to how the movie actually works for itself. The cast is very good, each one of the actors delivering believable roles, albeit the comic-book nature of the whole plot. Edward Norton is genuinely torn between his search for a cure and trying to save those close to him. Liv Tyler plays a good kind of damsel in distress while still maintaining a kick-ass sort of attitude at times (if you've seen the taxi scene you'll know what I mean), while William Hurt and Tim Roth provide the general antagonistic performance that one would expect. The action is well dosed, and paused only by the dramatic or psychological moments that actually give the movie some kind of depth behind the whole 'HULK SMASH!!!' routine. The special effects are top notch and a joy to watch, accompanied by a brilliant score by the brilliant Craig Armstrong, giving the film an epic feel. The sound effects are ear-blowing (literally) and only serve to emphasize the general 'Ouch!!!' factor present in the action scenes. The plot may not be so elaborate, the dialog not so engaging, but the general feel of the movie is a very good one and remains true to the iconic image of 'The Hulk'. The standard Stan Lee cameo is present in the form of a guy who dies after being poisoned by gamma radiation, while Robert Downey Jr. (as Tony Stark) makes a very surprising appearance towards the end of the movie, paving the way for 'The Avengers' movie. If you enjoyed 'The Hulk' as directed by Ang Lee, you'll love this movie. If you didn't... then chances are, if you're a Marvel fan, you'll still love this movie. I know I enjoyed it a lot, and I hope others will as well.I sign off this review by saying.... HULK SMASH!!! :)",8,4,10,13 June 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Doesn't fall short....
","Pirates of the Caribbean - Curse of the Black Pearl was probably one of the biggest surprises to me. POC - At World's End doesn't fall short of that reputation. After the very 'fishy' end to POC - Dead Man's Chest I eagerly awaited the inevitable comeback of Captain Jack Sparrow (wonderful role for Johnny Depp). After what I had seen in the trailers (especially the giant waterfall scene) I was filled with excitement as I waited for the release. I came out of the theater and talked about the movie all the way home. It's got everything anyone could ask for: action, laughs (wonderful one liners, catch phrases and facial expressions of the characters) and touch of romance without all the exaggerated, corny, mushy, tear-jerking scenes. *SPOILERS* For instance, I thought that the scene where Will and Elizabeth are fighting the crew of 'The Flying Dutchman' and Will asks Elizabeth to marry him was going to be another romantic scene that I just wanted to end. But I was actually surprised it was turned into a very comic and action packed scene. Or the scene where Will dies and replaces Davy Jones. You didn't see a lot of crying or comforting and it's one of the first time i've seen something like this. And to think this is a Walt Disney movie... *END OF SPOILERS* I recommend this movie to all of the fans of the previous parts in the series, and to those who haven't's any of the POC movies: GO SEE THEM. You'll like them, i can assure you. :D",10,1,1,26 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Could have been much better....
","I will go ahead and say this so people will understand why I didn't give this movie a lower grade: I love Spider-Man. I watched nearly the entire animated series when they first came out. However it pains me to see the third installment of this series fall flat under the two previous parts. Spider-Man was good, Spider-Man 2 was great, Spider-Man 3... could have been greater. First big mistake on the part of director Sam Raimi along with Ivan Raimi and the other people who wrote the screenplay was the fact that they tried to squeeze in 2 times more villains than the previous parts put together. Of course, if the movie would have had an epic time length of 4 hours this decision would have been fairly justified. Even more weird is the fact that even though we had this many villains and would have expected an even more action packed movie than the other two, Sam Raimi wanted to make room for tear-jerking, heart-breaking, pity-inspiring drama... he failed miserably. Why? It's not because of the over-exaggeration or the uncalled for soap-opera moments and not even the fact that some things just don't make all that much sense (like Spider-man kissing Gwen in front of his girlfriend as if just wanting to start a conflict, and his even cooler punch line 'She's just a girl from my class' instead of just saying something like 'I did it for the cameras') but because of one man: Tobey Maguire. I really appreciate him as an actor and i think he did a great job of playing Spider-Man, but i'll just go ahead and say this: he has 0 dramatic value in the scenes in which he is put. I mean seriously, upon seeing his face when he started crying i couldn't help but laugh. I figured at first that i might be a raving lunatic for transforming such 'dramatic' scenes into jokes. That is until people in 3 different cinemas (yes i have seen it 3 times) all laughed at the same scenes. Case closed. On the good side, the visual effects were just candy for the retina and i just couldn't help but almost drool at the sight of the battles and the sheer brutality of certain hits (speaking of which Harry Osbourne has a weird habit of just slamming his head into any hard object he can see right?). This was an aspect that made me pass over the drama and tear-jerking (tears of laughter) scenes only to expect another clash of titans. As a conclusion I recommend you go watch this movie with several friends so as to just have a good laugh when seeing Spider-Man cry his blue and red heart out at the thought that Mary Jane is going to dump him. Oh, one more thing. Although i don't appreciate the fact that director Sam Raimi brutally slaughtered the image of Spider-Man when he was wearing the suit by turning him into some crazed 70's disco fanatic, i have to admit it was funny as hell. However, i don't want to see a superhero turned into something like 'that' any time soon. :D",8,0,0,8 May 2007
Ratatouille," Worth a try at least...
","I'm going to start off with the fact that although I believe in freedom of speech and a difference of opinion, some people have either not seen this movie or are simply a film-wise equivalent of Anton Ego. I have seen dozens of people that just start to question all of the 'unrealistic' parts of the movie. THIS IS AN ANIMATED FEATURE FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE REALISTIC OR TO ENDORSE ANY KIND OF ACTIONS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE PERFORMED BY A NORMAL PERSON! IT'S MEANT TO ENTERTAIN AND IT DOES EXACTLY THAT!!! GET A LIFE AND THINK OF WHAT THE MOVIE AIMS TO BE BEFORE YOU QUESTION IT! Phew, now that that is off my chest, i'm going to start the actual review by saying that this is one of the greatest animated features if not the best movie i have seen. The CGI is absolutely amazing and even though i'm as critical as Ego when it comes to special effects, they left me in awe as i watched how beautifully Paris was portrayed before my eyes. The movie made me laugh more than ever and yes, you can't control somebody by pulling their hairs, yes a rat will never cook, yes you will never be able to start a business after you've gained a reputation of having a whole freaking colony of rats in your previous restaurant. But who cares? Even though everything is so far-fetched, the way it is all cooked together using a marvelous recipe is amazing, and delivers one very good movie. Going back to the fantastic side of the movie, i find it absolutely amazing that people have nothing against elves, dwarfs, gnomes or other such fantastic creatures seen in movies but they get hectic when it comes to a cooking rat :| Not many more words can be added without becoming either repetitive or really boring so i will only say this: Do not take into account what some people who are angry that an animated movie made it to it's well deserved position start saying about this movie and not even what i'm saying about it. Just go and see it for yourself just like i did, and please, beyond all else think of it as an experience and don't treat it like something from real life... it will only spoil any kind of feeling it may and probably will give you. And please be objective if you decide to rate it. I'm not saying to give it a 10, because it's not my place to impose such a thing. Just don't give it a review solely based on the fact that you want it down from the Top 100. If you come to hold a grudge against a movie i find that to be very sad to begin with...From my side, the story of Gusteau's little rodent apprentice deserves it's 5 stars, 10 mark and every appreciation that people who actually have a shred of their inner child can give. :)",10,2,4,10 September 2007
No Country for Old Men," Could have been great...
","One thing I have to admit is that I put off seeing this movie for far too long. I knew it was highly praised at most occasions where awards are handed out. I knew it was directed and adapted for the silver screen by the Coen brothers, for whom I have always had a great appreciation. I wanted to love this, and for the first hour and a half, I truly did. And then... something happened.It all started with the abrupt death of Llewelyn, slightly foreshadowed and poorly executed. While I did expect his death to occur at some point in time, it came and went so haphazardly, it actually went below feeling like a cheap plot device. Carson's death had some weight to it, at least, and he's a secondary character! Ambiguity works wonders for most of the Coen directed films, but here it only serves to frustrate anyone who even tries to make sense of what happens throughout the disjointed narrative. I've always loved the inherent randomness that comes with any movie directed by the Coen brothers, but in most other movies, it actually seems plausible and character motivations and actions seem grounded in some underlying logic that seems doomed to fail at one point.But here, ambiguity skirts the boundary of interesting, and then veers off to the realm of an unintelligible mishmash. And what makes that sadder is that there's a genuinely tense buildup for one of the most interesting antagonists I've seen for a while. Chigurh emulates a deceivingly simple archetype for a psychopathic murderer. But underneath that lunatic polish lies a complex character with both a meticulous conduct for murder, as well as an almost religious regard for the duality of fate. But even though Chigurh steals the show, he still feels like a dog without a leash sometimes, lacking any real purpose beyond his propensity for organised mayhem. While his motivation, in the form of retrieving the stolen money, is made relatively clear, whom or what he is working for is never really made apparent, and only serves to confuse, rather than entice.Th last minutes of the film make even less sense, slapping on events that serve no real purpose beyond being narrative hokum. I understand that the theme might be more about Bell realising his principles regarding the world may be outdated, but that is neither emphasised, nor is it framed well. The book may carry with it certain concepts that don't need much explaining, but the movie needs to shoulder its own weight, and I believe that it has failed at that from a narrative point of view. Perhaps I viewed the movie with escalated expectations, but I see no reason why that shouldn't be the case, as both the Coen brothers and Cormac McCarthy have delivered beforehand.While 'No Country for Old Men' isn't a bad movie, I do believe it could have been more than has been presented. I know I won't receive much praise for the bashing I have given the movie, given its considerable amount of fans, but although I tried to be part of that group, I can't bring myself to enjoy the movie as much as I would have wanted to.I rated the film lower than movies that have a much lesser significance mostly because the rating was given in regard to other productions by the Coen brothers, which I feel possess more quality and depth than what I have witnessed in 'No Country for Old Men'.",6,3,5,1 January 2015
Stardust," Beauty is in the eye of the beholder...
","Even considering the risk of being accused of plagiarism I cannot help but think that the summary I mentioned is perhaps the best thing to be said about this movie. I can not blame the side that chooses to discredit the film, nor the other one. I find that, in order to appreciate this film you need to have the kind of spirit that still believes in fairy tales, as long as they aren't exaggerated and do not give you the exact feeling that they are what they're supposed to be... not real. The movie, if compared to masterpieces of the fantasy genre does not excel through anything. However it provides a well cooked recipe of different stereotypical fantasy elements as well as a handful of original ones, while not wearing out the prior. It manages to stop things exactly when you believe they are going to become corny, provides laughs in the most unexpected of situations, and makes you leave the cinema with a warm feeling in your heart. At least that's the kind of impression left on most of the people I've talked to after they saw the movie. The acting isn't excellent (except for Robert De Niro's portrayal of a fairly gay captain :)) ), however it delivers as it should, and doesn't end up being lackluster in certain areas. The fighting scenes, although rare are very entertaining and fun to watch, especially the concept of a corpse being controlled via a voodoo doll. However I will stop the foolish analysis of all the separate elements of the film because the quality lies in the sum of its parts, not in the individuality of them. All in all, the first impression that the film left on me was that of a pleasant surprise, when I realized that decent adaptations of fantasy books can still be made. If you enjoy fairy tales that end with a happily ever after, without exaggerating it, then this is the movie for you. If you fall in the other category, you might still enjoy the film as a general experience.",9,1,1,1 December 2007
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Completely unexpected...
","I saw 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' out of curiosity when I heard it was nominated for the Oscars. Until that point I had never really heard of it, and I'm actually surprised this movie wasn't marketed more. It's actually a quite delightful tale, fast-paced, sprinkled with surprise and uplifting. The sum of morals exposed in this movie are just too many for me to write about here, however what I can say is that they are delivered seamlessly. The art direction is one that cannot fail, from my point of view. Stop motion has always been something that fascinated me, ever since I first saw 'A nightmare before Christmas', but that's just me. The acting is well-done and deliver, without being grating. All in all, the movie is one you won't feel pass by you, and that may or may not warrant a second viewing. Bottom line is... watch the movie. I can't say much more than that.",9,1,3,15 June 2010
