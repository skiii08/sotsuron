Blade Runner 2049," Ryan Gosling is still trying to be 'a real human being'
","The best part about Blade Runner 2049 is how visually engaging it is. The editing has a steady, rich pace. The film did feel very long, but this never distracted from the slow and occasionally ambiguous plot. The direction and composition holds your attention on the world of the film.Although the visual effects are consistently realistic, the environments aren't as imaginative nor as atmospheric as the bulky retro L.A. in the original Blade Runner, which was bursting with character and life. Some places in BR2049, such as the farm and the orphanage K visits, have a believably unique design; other places, like the memory manufacturer, er, don't. The art design on Denis Villeneuve's other sci-fi films (i.e. Enemy, Arrival) should give you a good idea of what to expect. The costume design is brilliant - possibly better than the original's.The biggest problem is the plot. The original BR had two narratives building at the same time - Deckard's hunt for the escaped replicants, and the replicants' hunt for their creator - and as the film goes on, we develop empathy for both parties. This is crucial, as a key theme in BR (and especially the book) is empathy; it separates androids from humans. We can empathize with all the characters' actions, even the immoral ones. Everyone feels human, which might, y'know, have something to do with the whole theme of the film? Y'know? In contrast, BR2049 has a polarizing 'good vs. bad' plot. The goodies escape from the baddies. Not much to contemplate, really. The protagonist is asked to find and kill someone, which could be an opportunity to explore some complex morality; but the film never takes the time to expand on this, because it's so caught up in it's own 'goodies versus baddies' plot.Jared Leto and Sylvia Hoeks play villains as forgettable as the fifteen billion other film villains exactly like them. But at least Hoeks is able to breathe some personality into her role, delivering some intense scenes - Leto's performance had next to no character. Neither come close to the brilliance of Steven Berkoff.In fact, with BR being an atmospheric and human film, the only excuse I can find for BR2049's complete lifelessness is that it was done on purpose. Maybe it's a metaphor for how it feels to be a slave android, with no free will? If that's the case, it's not a rewarding one. Villeneuve is notorious for ambiguous plots - my man Channel Criswell argues that ambiguity is the genius of Villeneuve's craft(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NJYnoNxLek)- but whilst films like Enemy (which has very similar themes to BR) are so confusing that the viewer feels almost obliged to work out what it all meant, BR2049 feels cold and detached. This is partly due to the acting.Ryan Gosling isn't a good actor. He is a guy who smiles slightly. That's all he does. He can only pull one face. Has anyone else noticed this? Because he seems to be getting a lot of roles recently. In which all he does is slightly smile. Enemy makes a good comparison: Jake Gyllenhaal plays a man going through an overwhelming psychological struggle, and his brilliant performance expresses this. The struggle is completely internalized, yet we still understand; and if we don't, we want to. Gosling's character contemplates things throughout BR2049, but we can't possibly work out what he's thinking. Narration and flashbacks have to be used, and even then it's unengagingly confusing. The other performances were fine. Mackenzie Davis was impressive, and Harrison Ford held up.The film was an entertaining pair of hours, but I doubt it'll stay with you, because I'll probably forget about it soon. It's not the ind of film I want to think about, nor had enough action scenes to warrant a rewatch.",Null,10,39,8 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Underhated Puddle Of Satanic Tears
","First of all, watch this review: https://www.youtube.com/watchv=FxKtZmQgxrI&list=PLF34EBB1D6806425 1 . It's one hour long, but if you have free time then I recommend you sit back and discover how insanely pathetic yet offensively horrendous Episode 1 is.Now that's out of the way, I am not exaggerating in the SLIGHTEST when I say that this is the worst film I have ever seen. The only reason critics don't give this monstrosity a -4/10 on a regular basis is because it's STAR WARS. Every awful line, shot and plot point is overlooked because they're associated with a franchise that had some good films in it. If this came out into cinemas as a standalone film not connected to a franchise then we would all hate it like the jolly bowl of urine it is. But no.The score isn't bad. In fact, one or two pieces of music in this film can be considered good. They're hummable, catchy and overall enjoyable. But OH MY GOD, what decency the soundtrack adds the rest of the film takes away.Let's start with the actors. More specifically, the characters. More specifically than that, a case of 'You Will Learn To Love Him'. This is when a film, book or any other story-based medium tries desperately to force a character down your throat, whilst screaming 'AREN'T THEY SO FUNNY AND SMART AND CLEVER AND AMAZING AND PERFECT?!?!'. This is Anakin Skywalker.I have nothing against Jake Lloyd. Actually, I do. The little git can't act for his life , bless him. His deadpan, emotionless voice makes Lucas' CRINGEWORTHILY CRINGEWORTHY dialogue even worse. 'Are you an angel?' Anakin asks like the little bugger he is. I don't know, Jake - are you a demon? OK, maybe I'm being mean. After all, he is a child actor. But it's the way Lucas treats him like this super cool awesome funny amazeballs child that kills anything and everything. The best example of this is when Anakin climbs into a spaceship, finds a helmet (that perfectly fits his tiny child-sized head for some reason, despite this being a good opportunity for some slapstick OH NO WAIT THAT WOULD MEAN INSULTING THE SUPER AWESOME ANAKIN KID) and flies it. FLIES IT. When he screams 'woohoo', fairies die.What's worse - a stupid, annoying child actor or professionals with no emotion? I love Liam Neeson, but his performance adds NOTHING to this film. None of the actors have any expressions or interesting features, except..... *sigh* Jar Jar Binks. You know what? He isn't the worst thing about this film. At least he has a character. At least he isn't treated like the messiah. And he's not as stupid as the plot.Ahh, the PLOT. I don't where to start - partly because it's so ridiculous, but also due to it being to unnecessarily complicated and BORING. The original films where simple: evil bad guy empire is evil, so good guy is good and learns to fight them. There's bits in between, and lore, but it's a simple story of someone training and learning to fight evil. Simple. What happens in Phantom Menace? Evil people want nice person to sign a peace treaty, so evil person... no... good people escort good person... I think... to place... but... I know they get stranded on a sandy planet and enter a pod race to win a new engine... but... I'm stumped.I'M NOT SAYING THE PLOT SHOULD BE SIMPLE. All I'm saying is: who cares? When was the last time you were watching a Star Wars film and thought, 'Hmm, I wonder what trade difficulties would be produced if there was an evil empire with some aliens?' I can't even make a proper joke there, because the plot is so ridiculous.It's stupid. It's under-hated. It's overrated. It's the worst film I have seen with my eyeballs. And I've seen Jack & Jill.",Null,1,10,20 December 2015
Thor: Ragnarok," Pretty good, for a genre I dislike
","I'm not a big fan of superhero films. They take themselves too seriously; and when they don't, everyone watching them takes them too seriously. I only went to see this film because my friend wanted to see it, and he wouldn't let me re-watch BR:2049 with him (which I've reviewed, quite negatively, but I'm willing to give a second watch).Thor: Ragnarok is a very likable film. The action is surprisingly fun: the fight scenes have engaging editing, which is a big step up from whatever was going on in the Avengers, five years ago. There are some imperfect editing choices, but the film's exciting nonetheless The fight with the Hulk was pretty damn brilliant.In fact, that's the best thing about this film: it's not the Avengers. It's Thor and his buddies going on an adventure, and I like that. It's not all like, 'ooh it's me Mr. McPantherman Mysterion Superdude the third, I'm interesting.' There are some cameos from other Marvel characters, and stuff like that, but you don't have to see their respective films to find their cameos entertaining. I didn't.Yes, the plot probably doesn't make a lot of sense when you think about it, but these films are about bloody big green people fighting lightning bois. They are clearly not meant to be thought about too hard, and I have nothing against that. There was only one time I found myself asking 'seriously?' and that was when Thor made this big, spoilerific decision that could've been solved with Hulk.The humour, as you've probably heard, is pretty spot-on. The comic relief character Corg was actually really funny, and Chris Hemsworth delivered some lines with brilliant timing, although Jeff Goldblum was a little painful.Look, I'll end with this: Thor Ragnorok is a big, fun film. It's big and it's fun. It's not the most fun you'll ever have at the movies, because it's not a perfect film. But it is fun. And I think it's awesome that this film is dumb and kinda silly. So don't act like it's anything more than that.",Null,40,71,25 October 2017

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," PLEASE PULL YOUR HEAD OUT YOUR ASS.
","I hate this film. I love the books, I love the director, but I hate the film.The style of the books was used to express Scott Pilgrim's quote unquote 'Precious Little Life.' All the video game references, surreal yet intimate imagery and sometimes fluctuating pace were all extensions of the character Scott. He was kinda awkward, kinda funny, kinda nerdy, kinda sweet, and kinda asocial yet kinda social. (The books are inspired by the song Scott Pilgrim by Plumtree, which is a pretty nice and sweet song).The book's style is as 'precious' as Scott Pilgrim himself. So it pisses me off to see the film butcher it entirely.The film's style is SELF-INDULGENT. It does things that aren't even neccessary and tell us nothing about the characters, like having comic book style onomatopoeia spring on the screen when a sound effect plays. WHY? It's like a hipster grabbing you by the ears and screaming in your face 'I'm really clever and funny!'The characters in this film are DEAD. I do not like Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim. Such a rich character is reduced to a basic pale-faced pathetic little weeb as one-dimensional as the line 'hey Wallace.' Scott was pathetic in the books, but he had potential. This was what the whole series was rooted around: potential. All characters in this film are dull. Not one stands out as entertaining. Well, I guess the actress playing Stills' bitchy girlfriend is convincingly bitchy.The depression Scott goes through towards the end of the saga - from it's heart-wrenching introduction at the end of the fivth book, to it's equally emotional conclusion halfway through the second - is reduced to another forced 'problem' for a processed third act that needs to be 'resolved'.The books were, above all, real. The crazy style was spun from its REAL heart. The film just wants to show off.",Null,1,8,10 March 2018
