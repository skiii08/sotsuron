Source Code," exceeded my expectations
","I went in with not many options on what to watch so i picked the first screening of Source code with low expectations. assuming i am in for a low budget, CGI centered movie but fortunately i was mistaken.they made a good story looks great with less information being fed to the audience the more intriguing it gets.it is one of those movie you'd enjoy watching simply because the acting, screenplay and cinematography were Good, interesting and brilliant.Overall a good Sci-fi/Action movie with all the primary elements available the relatively interesting story with a couple of twists adding a portion of action peppered with a slash of romance and humor.only rated it 8! since there was some room for improvement! casting a bad guy should revolve around his dislike-ability of his actions or mental state and neither were dominantly present.",8,3,7,31 March 2011
Avatar," Mind blowing 3D experience sadly with a predictable plot!!!
","Its one of the Few movies that i watched without checking the trailer, why ? For some reason most of my friends recommended the movie describing it as a one of kind sci-fi movie, so i wondered would it be a new original science fiction plot that could leave you wondering through out the entire movie Like the Matrix or Terminator.Excited to feed my Imagination,i rushed to the movies the following day with great expectations knowing what James Cameron can and will do with such a budget (up the $350M).Not that i was disappointed but i was shocked, the 3-D experience is amazing especially with the mind blowing CGI effects down to the smallest details that were put to make that universe a real one. The Directing, music and the cinematography were outstanding, the actors are better then your average sci-fi heroes but what really ruined it is what should have made it a great movie the Plot.To say the least very predictable and the way they feed the information to the viewers in the first 40 min killed all the mystery of what to expect in a new universe where life exist. beside how predictable this movie was i couldn't help wondering where i have seen this type of heroism plot before ... sadly thats the last thing you could expect from Cameron.Frankly this movie is very entertaining it have the twist and the turns you would expect in an action movie the effects are amazing especially if your planing to watch it in 3-D, some seasoned movie enthusiast might spot the plot fatal errors in information feeding and the duplication from old movies but for those who are just planing to Enjoy an action filled Sci-fi especially for the youngsters it beats most of the movies out there. This is my First Review on IMDb Feedback in rating is appreciated Thanks",7,3,8,1 January 2010
