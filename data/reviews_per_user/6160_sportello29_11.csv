Howl's Moving Castle," Beautiful
","Howl's moving castle. Hayao Miyazaki is truly in a league of his own. His fantasy, tedious attention to details, unpredictable and gripping style all make his work stand out. And what I mean by stand out is that it really captivates you, every scene makes you demand for more and at the same time wonder how could one think of something this surreal. Yet, no matter how surreal, vivid, and sometimes outright ridiculous Miyazaki might seem at times, his work is still full of valuable lessons, meaningful comparisons and fairy tale-like emotions. Howl's moving castle is no different.Our antagonist is a hat maker Sophie, who, due to a spell had been turned into an old woman, and a brave young wizard named Howl, who constantly spends his time in a constantly moving castle, powered by a quirky little ball of fire named Calcifer, who itself is a part of Howl's heart. Howl's moving castle takes us on a beautiful, thrilling and breathtaking journey that introduces us to some of the funniest and bizarre characters a viewer would expect to see. All the characters however are there for a reason and each little story, from Sophie helping the witch that cast the spell on her to Howl constantly running away from his problems, are there to teach us a lesson. But not in the kind of a way Madagascar or Ice Age would. Miyazaki really forces us to think and come to our own conclusions. I think this is the essence of all truly great films â€“ everyone takes lessons of their own out of them.Howl's moving castle, like most Moyazaki's films, is a true work of art. The plot is thrilling, unpredictable, subtly funny and remarkably original. The animations are stunning. The details in every scene will leave you dazzled and amazed, to say the least. The classical music soundtrack, that is constantly fading in and out is perfectly in tune with the beautiful style and scenery. Yet again, Hayao Miyazaki manages to raise the bar on what true animation and story telling is really about. A near perfect film.",9,0,1,19 February 2015
Spotlight," People who shine from within don't need a spotlight
","Spotlight tells a story of the reporters of the Boston Globe, where the 'Spotlight' team uncovered a huge, global scandal of child molestation within the local Catholic Church. Spotlight is at its foremost a story about humans, communicating the sides of victims, layers, priests, clerks and reporters, as well as the one of true determination, honor and persistence. Spotlight at its core is a great, detailed investigative reporting piece. It deeply analyzes the human against the bureaucratic and political aspects of being a reporter, righteously glorifying the seemingly boring parts of the profession, which in the end all play an integral role in the resolution. The nature of the piece that is being investigated is so surreal and unbelievable that it adds an incredible aura of mystery and suspense into scenes that otherwise would have not stood out. The dialogues are sharp and smart. They show not just the reporting side, but carefully convey the human emotions of these reporters. Tom McCarthy's style is very fitting to the picture he paints. He is very direct and honest with his shots, giving us many close ups of the characters, helping further analyze the emotions that they are going through. The cast made this kind of directing possible by perfectly blending in with the characters; no one in particular stood out because no one needed to. There is no single hero here.At first glance Spotlight might seem like another story of underdogs against a blind, soulless, corrupted system, yet the involvement of the Church significantly changes how the story is perceived. It makes these terrible events seem so much more appalling and significant that even the most eventless scenes become incredibly tense and thought provoking.Yet the point of Spotlight is not to glorify the underlying story or bring the guilty to justice. We get none of that. Spotlight is about showing the process of true, detailed reporting. The 'Catholic Church' story of 2001 was most likely picked due to it's relevance. In essence, this movie could have been about any story, and it still would have succeeded on all the notes that it had. This might make Spotlight one the best films about investigative reporting, the one that fully communicates the demanding, punishing and grueling aspects of the profession.As such the conclusion of Spotlight is not a victory of the justice system, it is not even a human victory where the victims can finally rest assured. It is the victory of the Spotlight team as reporters, echoed by the storm of incoming calls from victims all across America - their piece has made a difference.",8,1,2,18 January 2016
The Hateful Eight," Bringing guilty men in alive is a good way to get yourself dead.
","''The Hateful Eight' 70mm Roadshow pays tribute to the grand film exhibition style popularized in 1950' and 60's and that brought audiences to theatres with a promise of a special event. It delivers a unique experience that hasn't been had in over fifty years.''The Hateful Eight' truly is a unique and special event. Three hours long, including a beautiful musical intro, a ten-minute intermission in the middle and a small souvenir program. This format pays tribute to pictures like Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, Ben-Hur and a handful of others that were presented in the same, captivating manner. The Roadshow Engagement really changes the underlying nature of a modern day cinema experience, making it seem as going to a theatrical performance. The Ultra Panavision 70 format, which was used to shoot the movie, and Tarantino's masterful editing, have greatly enhanced that theatrical feel. The camera provides an incredibly wider and more detailed image. Each scene simply captures more and thus gives the viewer more room to explore the intricate details. Only a handful of movies have ever been made in this format, with the last motion picture (Khartoum) dating 1966.It seems that Quentin Tarantino is in the best possible way 'indifferent' to critical acclaim, in same magnificent way Coen brothers or Paul Thomas Anderson are, amongst a few others. He is shooting about 'what he truly loves' and his pictures consistently retain an unbelievably unique flair. It is an incredibly rare example of a director and a writer who is mindlessly comfortable in his own style and given all the means to conceptualize and visualize that style; and yes, that style happens to have controversy, dark humor, raw violence, vivid portrayals of greed, revenge and hatred. 'Eight' might be discredited due to it's seeming 'shallowness'. Many will argue that the dialogues are pointlessly long, the 'N' word is this time aimlessly abused and the bloody violence is not so much out of place as it is simply not qualified for. The Tarantino 'hero' has usually evoked violence based on something noble, like 'The Bride' in 'Kill Bill', 'Django' in 'Django Unchained' or the bastards in the 'Inglorious Bastards'. Yet these exact arguments could and should be turned upside down. In 'The Hateful Eight' we receive a work of a master that is not afraid to experiment with rare formats and movie plots that contain solely antagonists. Tarantino knows that he can 'get away' with almost anything and he utilizes it to his advantage. He loves to examine ruthless characters motivated by questionably noble causes that are placed in the worst situations that bring out the worst in human nature. While this might at times look and feel 'over the top', this is exactly what makes Quentin one of the most fascinating directors of all time.'The Hateful Eight', Tarantino's 8th film is by all means no exception. Containing an incredibly captivating and thrilling storyline, in the best possible way it pays homage to Tarantino's first movie, 'Reservoir Dogs', adding the so- familiar, crime-fueled 'confusion'. In detail, we examine Eight bad guys that 'find shelter' in Minnie's haberdashery in the middle of a blizzard. As events unfold and true motivations are slowly unraveled, we receive a violent, bloody tale fueled by merciless revenge, racial tensions, rage and integrity. The dialogues are wonderfully smart and satirical, however what truly makes them stand out are the actors. The all-time, old school Tarantino cast seems as comfortable with the director as he is with violence and blood. This results in some of the best performances that a cast could possibly produce. Legendary Ennio Morricone marks 'The Hateful Eight' as the first Western he has composed music for in forty years, with the last movies being 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', 'Once Upon a Time in America', 'The Untouchables' and many others. His music is fitting to the plot and to the scenery, at times softly flowing with the story and at times doing the exact opposite, adding even more emotion and suspense.The exceptional 70mm format, that practically transforms us into the freezing, gorgeous, remote, wintery landscapes of 'Wyoming' and the remarkable skill, experience, and thorough knowledge of Quentin Tarantino, all make 'The Hateful Eight' the best Western of the 21st Century as well as one of the best cinema experiences one could ever encounter.",9,51,123,31 December 2015
Inside Out," Meet the voices inside your head
","Pixar's Inside Out is incredibly refreshing. It is one of those rare instances when an animation film succeeds to deliver on every level, it is touching, emotional, funny, extremely artistic and imaginative. Our antagonists are the emotions that drive a 13 year old girl named Riley. We have Joy, Sadness, Anger Fear and Disgust. Like any child growing up, Riley experiences various sad and happy events and her emotions act accordingly, many times in hilarious and sarcastic ways. Every character is thus driven by their own emotions and everyone's emotions, even though they are the same, look and act differently, shaping and growing along with their rightful owner.What is most striking about inside out is how creative and clever it is. Yet, nothing is ever overcomplicated or confusing. One would assume that an animation film about the adventures of emotions in a girls mind can get really out of hand, Inside Out is the complete opposite. Everything is touchingly logical and simple, from the train of thought and 'memory islands' to the 'cleaners' that get rid of useless memories. Whilst watching you are almost wondering: 'is this really what could be happening inside my head? 'The animations are very vivid yet soft, supporting Pixar's consistent style. The plot itself is interesting and very thought provoking due to the nature of the underlying idea. It something that both kids and adults can deeply relate to. That idea is so creative, with a capital C, that it almost wouldn't have mattered what the plot was, I would have been more then happy to just explore different characters' emotions and their behaviors. And these are the feelings that a truly good film should evoke. Inside Out, by a long mile, is the best animation film released this year.",9,7,29,21 June 2015
It Follows," It doesn't think. It doesn't feel. It doesn't give up.
","After an innocent one stand, our antagonist Jay finds herself plagued with a mysterious virus, an unknown force, 'IT', that follows her around everywhere she goes. Throughout the movie Jay and her friends try to demystify this strange occurrence, which is always a few steps away.The plot is original and very interesting to follow, however it is also relatively straightforward which does take some of the suspense away closer to the credits. Yet, 'It Follows' is shot and edited with a surgeon's precision, it is genuinely scary, extremely suspenseful and will leave you paranoid and holding tight to your seat on more then a few occasions. It is truly a horror film at it's finest, mysterious, terrifying and gripping.Parts of this film, especially the ending reminded me of Kubrick's Shining, sometimes it feels very nostalgic, like you are watching bits of The Sixth Sense again. What makes this film truly great is the nature of the plot, the mystery behind it. 'IT' takes many forms, which at times makes it almost impossible to distinguish it from a normal human being, just like in real life in some way. The monster could be anywhere and anyone.'It doesn't think. It doesn't feel. It doesn't give up.'The soundtrack really stands out; It is perfectly in tune with the scene, surroundings and the plot. It gives you goose bumps even during the scenes where nothing is happening. Dark, classical sounds adds so much emotions, gives you a feeling that 'IT' is somewhere behind you, in the movie theater.Even though all the actors' performances are rock-solid, this movie is really about the maestro. Written and Directed by David Robert Mitchell (his second feature film), this is all about his craft, his story and his ability to turn this story in one of the most refreshing horror films I have seen in years.",8,95,183,15 April 2015
Gone Girl," A thriller at it's finest
","This movie is about a genius psychopath, about the prolonged pleasure of revenge. Amazing Amy (Rosamund Pike's best performance yet), who really is amazing, is a smart, charismatic and very positive character. With the help of her parents, she had made a name for herself early in her childhood through writing a book called Amazing Amy, which was a partially autobiographical novel based on Amy's real childhood. It is initially through this book that we get to have a glance on Amy's real hidden insanity and thirst for manipulation. Her own story wasn't perfect enough for Amy and she manipulated the character to have all the things she desired at that point â€“ lots of friends, a pet and other little pleasures children wish for at this age. Also in that very scene we get a sense of how gullible, simple and narrow-minded is her husband, Nick, brilliantly portrayed by Ben Affleck. The best he can do is shoot a good joke in a serious conversation or side with Amy on her 'unfortunate childhood'. We get an impression of Affleck as a sort of a trophy husband for Amy, he is good looking, charming and well mannered, however wildly unambitious, which makes him a perfect fit for someone like Amy, who likes and needs to be in control. The intellectual and cultural difference between the two is one of the things that strikes first in their relationship, emphasized with Amy's desire to dictate things, which is echoed in the film through many gestures like the ties she bought him, the watch that he hates but still wears etc. Yet she definitely and truly loves him and in the beginning he does so too. Love is the only thing Amazing Amy was never able to control - and that's what initially drives her mad â€“ jealousy. She recalls a scene where she goes to surprise Nick to a bar they owned (bought on Amy's money) and spots him with a woman that he kisses using the same gesture of love he used when they first met â€“ and that for her is the tipping point. At this point, he already gradually ruined her big life ambitions, first by getting sacked during the recession, then by forcing her (without asking) to move to a different town to help take care of his dying mother and then, on top of everything, by falling in love with someone else. Love is the best and the worst thing that ever happened to Amy â€“ we see how she quietly suffers without being able to let go, it drives her absolutely insane â€“ we clearly see that her ambitions and abilities are far beyond the lifestyle she lives. It is a sweet mixture of love-to-hate and revenge that fuels Amy in the journey she carefully and brilliantly plans and with a killer hand and instincts â€“ embarks on. By all means she is incredibly smart and thoughtful â€“ a genius even â€“ we see that when she guides us through her mastermind plan that undoubtedly involved tedious planning and persistence. She however is a woman that doesn't strike us by making spontaneous decisions and the fact that she still truly loves Nick, something she still can't control â€“ ruins her plan in end. At the turning point of the movie, Amy loses all the money she carefully saved in order to completely execute her plan, however when this falls through, she is again left with a situation she cannot control and that she didn't plan for. Somewhere in the midst of running away, watching Nick perform his glorious smiles on TV and losing all her savings probably made her also realize that her life isn't worth his, that he would probably suffer even more with constantly having her around again after all that happened. At this point Amy's complete descent into madness begins. She reaches out to an old high school boyfriend â€“ later â€“stalker Desi who again seems like a perfect target for Amazing Amy to manipulate â€“ he is desperately in love with her and is willing to go all lengths necessary to make it work between them again. In Desi we also see how his deep unintentional love for Amy eventually destroys him. Going back to the scene where Amy initially reaches out to Desi, it is evident that she does so for the purpose of being able to come home again and continue manipulating her relationship with Nick. Desi by all means is a perfect target for this.Amy seems to have this ability to constantly control people, but in a way that a psychopath would, stealthily, strategically, without the target even noticing. Even after all what happened, even after the pregnancy, Nick seems to almost adjust to the situation. He even tells his sister, who supported him all the way through, that the baby is his (even though Amy artificially made this happen without telling him) and that maybe he should try and makes this work with Amy.One thing remains certain about the amazing Amy Dunn - her nature, choices and unfortunate circumstances have led to a complete and unstoppable descent into evil, revenge, madness and a deep dark desire to be in control of her perfect life, which is a state we leave her and Nick in when the credits start running.",7,3,15,5 October 2014
The Hurt Locker," Gripping, yet wildly overestimated thriller
","Heat of combat, Iraq war, we are introduced to a bomb disposal team of 3 who are in the middle of action. We are thoroughly guided through scenes of just how dangerous and unpredictable this job is and how much precaution and observation needs to be taken at each step. This is amplified by the death of the team leader, who goes on to physically disarm the bomb only to get blown up by a triggered detonator set up by an unforeseen enemy. This scene provides a great contrast going forward, when a new sergeant, James, takes over the squad. He will be conducting similar physical disarming's on a daily basis, even unnecessarily at times, which greatly adds to the heroic recklessness of his character, brilliantly portrayed by Jeremy Renner (maybe the only deserved Oscar nomination).Throughout the rest of the movie we get to know the squad better, which now consists of team leader James, sergeant Sanborn and a less experienced specialist Owen Eldridge. Both Eldridge and Sanborn are depicted just how one would expect from soldiers in their line of work â€“ human - they are terrified, scared for their lives, extremely cautious and counting down the days to dispatch. In retrospect James is a true, real life hero. No matter how dangerous the situation might be, he will dive into it head first. We see James almost die while trying to save innocent people â€“ an Iraq civilian and earlier an Iraq child that he was careless enough to bond with. He disarms numerous bombs, sometimes without even wearing a protective suit. On one occasion we learn that his total was somewhere around '857' disarmed bombs. James proves a great leader too and even though his fearless tactics are â€“at heart- resented by his teammates â€“ they definitely realize and respect his experience, courage and authority. James, in the best way he can, really cares for his team, but in the same way as a hero tends to care for those that need help and guidance â€“ he seems to have this never ending desire and drive to help.This desire for some reason does not echo at James' home, where he has a wife and a child waiting. His wife seems to accept John as he is, in the mere amount of time that is devoted to that, and realize that there is nothing she can do to change that. And maybe no one can. Unfortunately there is not enough intimacy with the characters. A lot of time is devoted to gripping and suspenseful combat scenes and the portrayal of characters through these scenes, however the dialog's remain relatively dull and to the point. Bigelow doesn't let us really dive into any of the characters fully. We want to know more about James' past, what kind of man he was before the army, and what really motivates him. We are eager to find out Sanborn's past and what mistakes he has done in his life. Kathryn Bigelow only leaves us making educated guesses. And as such, this movie does not succeed. This movie is about real life war heroes that unfortunately no one will probably ever hear or read about. And as such this move succeeds on a thrillingly patriotic kind of way, yet it fails to give us a full, detailed look into the human aspects of these heroes, which makes for a very unfulfilled feeling at the end.",7,0,1,15 February 2015
Snowden," Lots of people cruise happily through life, why can't I?
","Oliver Stone's Snowden is a story about an NSA whistleblower who's revelations about the Government's secret surveillance programs have shaken the public to it's core. It is a story of a man who willingly went against his country to initiate a change projected by the freedom of speech and information. During the summer of 2013 when all the information came to light, Ed's case was widely publicized as the vast majority of news channels and papers headlined his stories and discovery's. In 2014 Laura Poitras' Oscar-winning 'Citinezfour' carefully documented Snowden's account. Poitras, just like Greenwald, MacAskill & Gibson played an integral part in making Snowden's story come to life.All of these characters feature in 'Snowden' and possibly through great acting as well as the relevance of the story, they are able to project the realism and tension that make this film demanding. Joseph Gordon-Levitt looks so much like Edward Snowden it's uncanny at times. He does an incredible job of replicating the person we see in all the documentaries and actual footages of Edward, yet his character still feels mechanic and robotic. It's not however Joseph's fault as Oliver Stone's script seems too shallow at times. Rather then portraying Ed's emotions and feelings, Stone's 'Snowden' looks a lot like a Hollywood version of 'Citizenfour'. Throughout the movie Stone uses extensive crosscutting between various important events from Edward's past and the final days with the reporters in the infamous Hong Kong hotel room. The events that Stone shows act as a good summary of how Snowden has come to make the decisions he has made. However this feels repetitive at times. I'm afraid that 'Snowden' will not get much credit mainly due to the amount of information already made available by 'Citizenfour'. While Oliver Stone is undoubtedly a great storyteller, this story could have been told from a more human angle. There is no subjectivity in Stone's character. I have very similar thoughts about Robert Zemeckis 2015 movie 'The Walk' and James Marsh's documentary 'Man on Wire'. Funnily enough it also involves Joseph Gordon Levitt.Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography is stunning and very fitting to how Stone tells the story. Employing mainly mid-range shots and taking time to establish the scenes, he gives the characters room to move around and act, while the 'mood' of the scenes differs drastically as we are guided through secret Government Intelligence locations, Hong-Kong hotels & Hawaii landscapes. Anthony knows exactly how to achieve impact and tension, employing similar techniques he used in 'Slumdog Millionaire', 'Rush' & '127 Hours'. While Oliver Stone does an honest job showing some of the main pieces of Edward Snowden's story as well as projecting the 'Architecture of Oppression' that he faced, his script feels empty. In one of the scenes Snowden says that a lot of people cruise happily through life, why can't he? Unfortunately, we never get a chance to explore this question.",7,2,7,15 November 2016
Arrival," Why are they here?
","Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is a study of how humans communicate and attempt to understand each other. It examines human relationships that are endured through time, bringing into perspective the intricacies of our language and our interactions with something we don't understand. Only lastly is it a sci-fi movie about extraterrestrial life. Villeneuve has proved to be a director of utmost talent and diversity, but also the one that surrounds himself with equal talent, the Arrival being no different. Young's (Selma; A Most Violent Year) cinematography and style in depicting the research groups enter the mysterious ships produces some of the most groundbreaking sci-fi scenes that have ever been shot. The ships themselves look like timeless, shapeless monoliths. They defy the laws of physics and seem to have their own atmosphere inside. It is truly a grandiose, terrifying, unknown object. The Aliens inside those ships as well as the surroundings seem to raise more questions then answers, while the ships gloriously 'stand' on the backdrop of incredible landscapes, such as oceans, mountains and panoramic plains.JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson is a long time favorite of Villeneuve, producing scores for Sicario and Prisoners. In Arrival his score elevates the scenes, adding tension utilizing mostly classical, timeless sounds. It is some of the best work Johann has done to date. Most importantly however Arrival brings a story that is original, beautifully ambitious and most surprisingly relatable and real. Real enough to believe that if this had happened tomorrow, the outcomes would not have been much different. It might however be that ambition that sometimes separates Arrival from being a true masterpiece. We witnesses the Arrival of the Alien ships through the eyes of a linguist professor, Dr. Louise Banks, convincingly played by Amy Adams. Louise is constantly haunted by a series of flashbacks depicting her daughter's life & early death. It is unknown how this is connected to the Arrival, but this relationship establishes the infrastructure for what Denis is possibly trying to convey, the pain and joy that language, time & communication bring. The aliens don't seem to be hostile; rather, they are trying to say something that a human can't translate. This is where Louise is required, trying to communicate with the aliens to understand the purpose of the arrival. However as the inability to understand grows, so do human frustrations, leading to inevitable disputes, wars and drastic actions. In Arrival we see China as the first country to decide to take actions against the aliens, with no apparent reason. In a comically ironic scene, we see the Chinese leader give the Aliens 24 hours to vacate before starting the attacks. Communications stall as all the research groups go offline, while Banks and her team race against time looking for answers. Some parts of the Arrival echo the Roadside Picnic by the Strugatsky brothers. There, Aliens have come and left, leaving behind mysterious 'zones' filled with objects that only 'Stalkers' dare to explore. The metaphor that humans perceive aliens similarly to how insects perceive humans & human objects, imagining a group of ants stumbling upon an abandoned roadside picnic, full of mysterious objects and sights. Yet the message of the Arrival is different. It originates from a kinder place, it projects the need for working together, for using language to try and understand others. In this sense the sci-fi aspect of Arrival can be seen almost as an allegory to say that as humans we owe it to each other to communicate more before taking actions, regardless of how painful the outcomes might be. I fear many will critique The Arrival for this 'kindness', for deviating from a more traditional resolution, but it's refreshing. That a director is able to portray an Alien arrival in such a rational, artistic and melancholic way is a tribute to his strength of character.",8,34,66,8 October 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," What do we talk about when we talk about filmmaking?
","Birdman or the unexpected virtue of ignorance is this year's film of the year. A remarkable deep satire on modern Hollywood shot and panned out so brilliantly it leaves one shocked and stunned with emotions long after the credits start running.Genuinely and passionately portrayed by M. Keaton, Birdman follows up a once-famous-now- washed-up movie star (Riggan Thomspon) who is trying to revamp himself by directing, writing and acting in his own adaptation of a love story. Riggan, just like all of us to an extent, has a big ego, which is portrayed as a physical character in birdman, a representation of something that Riggan was never able to let go. He misses the fame, the power, the fans; his desire is to be on the top again. After all, we would all love to fly across Times Square, high above everyone else. And this is all a part of a great, hilarious and clever sarcastic joke that Inarritu allows us to see. Every major character in the movie is a satire on Hollywood and it's ways. From the co-actresses starring in the play (brilliantly portrayed by Naomi watts and Andrea Riseborough) who only desire to make it and get recognized, Riggan's agent who only cares about the public outcome rather then the one of his best friend, the critic that puts her own emotions and thoughts above everything else, audiences reactions when Riggan actually shoots himself on stage, to finally Riggan himself, who can't stay true to the twitter-and-facebook era and simply dreams of making it big again, despite all the difficulties and the sheere absurdity of doing something as blunt as his own theater production.Yet on the side of this all, Riggan's wife is the most sensible of it all, and maybe the only thing Riggan has in his life that is true, real. She loves him for who he is and seemed to adjust to his ever growing ego, but you can clearly see how she despises it all, everything to do with this industry and it's pretentious people. And we see this echoed in their conversation just before the final scene, where Riggan can finally be honest enough to say that he regrets it all, not being with his family enough for the most part. Yet was is still so striking and inspiring about Riggan is his inability to give up, no matter what obstacles come his way, he has managed to put them aside in various ignorant (remortgaging his house that was meant to be for Sam) and hilarious (dropping a light bulb on an actor he didn't like) ways. Mike is another character that adds so much needed diversity and angle to this film. He is a complete opposite of Riggan, he couldn't care less about the critics or what people think of him, as opposed to Riggan, he can only be himself on stage, he can't get it up with women and seems like a self-absorbent and ignorant character. His ego clashes with Riggan's, but Mike's 'Birdman' isn't quite the same as Riggan's â€“ he seems genuinely happy with what he has achieved and most importantly he is confident in everything he does, the exact opposite of Riggan himself. This provides a superb contrast into two completely different yet very similar people.Everything is amplified even more with an amazingly original drums-only soundtrack that is so emotionally powerful it almost takes your breath away. Adding an even more original one-shot directing style makes this movie really stand out. It is a daring and honest experiment that in my opinion is a trillion times harder to pull off then something like boyhood.The controversial ending simply represents the transformation of Riggan from Birdman to his stage character, who kills himself in the end. On the last scene we see Birdman, however this is the first time when he is not talking to Keaton, finally birdman's time has come and Riggan is able to move on by flying and exploring uncharted territories of his own. He was finally able to let go of Birdman.What are we doing here? â€“ is the question asked by Michael (Ed Norton) to Sam (Emma Stone) at one point in the movie, which might just be the subtle sense of it all.",9,12,25,28 February 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," 'Too big to fail'
","Written and directed by George Miller, this is his fourth Mad Max film to date. His portfolio is notably diverse and also includes the horror/comedy The witches of Eastwick and the Oscar winning animation gem Happy Feet. To date, Mad Max is also Miller's most audacious and vivid attempt to truly impress and dazzle the audience, in a much less cuter way then Happy Feet. Unfortunately this is the one and only note that Miller succeeds in.Mad Max is beautiful, stylish and vivid. The premise of the storyline of Mad Max movies in it's nature has always been fascinating, a dystopian future dominated by motorcycle gangs, violent heroes, villains and survival. As such this also might be the biggest thing that's wrong with Mad Max, it's too ambitious, there is too much happening and thus too much time is spent on showing and depicting the scenery, the characters, leaving little room for actual dialogues and an interesting storytelling. The movie is essentially one, big, 2-hour long, chaotic chase - no wonder Max is a man of few words.The vast majority of the scenes are very fast paced and short, switching from one angle to another in split seconds, making it hard to concentrate or capture the full creativity of the scenery. There are however a few scenes with very unusual camera angles which greatly add to the dynamic of the movie. The premise of a huge long chase also makes it hard to focus on someone for a long time. The colors are amazing, vivid and contrasting, which is very enjoyable to the eye, the same way the works of Frank Miller are. The golden-yellow desert, matched with dark biker hybrid cars, motorcycles and insane gang-members is definitely pleasing and fun, but only for about thirty minutes. After the initial 'wow' moment passes and one adjusts to the scenery, Hardy's brutality and Theron's new hairstyle, one should quickly realize that Mad Max has nothing more to offer.The storyline and the dialogues are too dull to compensate for the amazing special effects, background and characters. I was personally disappointed, expecting more of a 'Sin City' then a '300'.",6,2,13,17 May 2015
