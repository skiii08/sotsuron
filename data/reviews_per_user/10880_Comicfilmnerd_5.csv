The Incredible Hulk," Gamma Radiation Did Not Save This Film!
",This movie had allowed for fans to understand a different side to the Hulk that the one seen in the earlier movie Hulk (2003). The Incredible Hulk (2008) brings to light the character of Abomination and plays him into the Hulk. The cameo of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) at the end of the movie during post-credit scene was a nice surprise and had started the tying together of the characters within the MCU. 8/10. Not a huge fan at the end of the day.,8,0,0,19 August 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Excellent Movie!
","To say the least, it brought so many story lines together and had brought the MCU to a rebirth of sorts. Saddening parts like the loss of Tony Stark and the end of Steve Roger's reign as Captain America. 10/10 . ( I would have given it a 12/10 but the scale doesn't go high enough). Amazing, well thought out and emotional movie.",10,39,61,16 August 2019
The Imitation Game," BO BNBAJOH QMNU! (AN AMAZING PLOT!)
","This film had left me no other words than 'bravo...'. Within the film's clever subject of Alan Turing and Enigma, led an interesting backstory to the man who is now recognized for countless inventions and also for the Turing machine. Amazing film and 10/10 for the plot and accuracy of the film.",10,0,1,23 August 2019
Iron Man," A Film With Charisma!
",Great movie and great start to the MCU. Could not have asked for a better actor to play Iron Man either. The plot was clever and had used a lot of easter eggs towards the comics and also caught Tony Stark's sense of humour to a precise point. 10/10. It is (and will always be) a great movie.,10,0,2,19 August 2019
Deadpool," Deadpool! What A @!$%#!Â£ Great Movie!
","Funniest superhero movie I have ever seen. It is a guaranteed favourite of mine and always will be. The choice of actor had not made this choice any harder due to it being the one and only... Ryan Reynolds, a personal favourite of mine. 10/10. (I would give it 11/10 if i could). My absolute favourite movie, can't be beat.",10,0,1,19 August 2019
