The Ring," Apparently a lot of people scare very easily
","I am on a quest: to find a movie that will truely frighten me- what does a girl have to see to scare the pants off of her? With all the hype surrounding this movie, which so many have called 'the scariest movie ever' I was hoping to have found a truely scary movie. I did not.
My conclusion from watching this movie is a lot of people are very easily frightened. What on Earth did people find so very frightening about this movie? It doesn't have a more than mildly frightening scene in it up until the last 15 minutes. Personally, I wouldn't rank it in the top 20 scariest movie, never mind *the* scariest. I should have know better than to expect it to be scary when one of the ads compared it to Rosemary's Baby, which is about as scary as 3-day-old leftovers- you know, before they go all green and moldy.However, if people thought The Ring was really scary, they should see Session 9, another non-scary horror movie that has a similar 'feel' to it, which seems to scare some people, anyway.Don't get me wrong, though, the Ring is a pretty good movie, I'd give it a 7.5 or 8 out of 10, but it's just not very scary.",7,0,0,4 November 2002
Grave of the Fireflies," Definitely *Not* 'the saddest movie I've ever seen'
","The only thing I'd heard about this movie before seeing it was many people saying that it was the saddest movie they've ever seen. I finished watching it about a half an hour ago, and I can only conclude that the people who think so probably don't watch many sad movies.It was very good and even sad, but it was far from the saddest movie I've ever seen. Perhaps it's the first five minutes of the movie that 'ruined' that element for me. It was made perfectly clear what was going to happen by the end, so expecting it made it less sad. To me, anyway.I guess I'll have to chalk this up to another 'est' movie- saddest, scariest, funniest- that many have viseral reactions to that I simply don't get.",7,0,26,10 July 2003
