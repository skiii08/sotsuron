Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Brilliant and Highly Enjoyable!
","Lets start backward and cut to the chase first, this movie is brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable. There are myriad different pieces which have all worked well on this but the biggest by far is the screenplay and direction. And to put some smarts at it, what makes it great is you neither have to remember the first, nor have to watch this as a sequel. You will also not find the need to compare it to others. In fact, you could watch this first and then watch the part that came before, and you would be equally thrilled with both. Lets start separating the gems and get into why this movie is a great watch.First the screenplay and direction, where Guy Ritchie has done what he does best. The characters are well carved out, there is a plot, there is a case, and there is a solid END. The writers Michele Mulroney, and Kieran Mulroney have packed this with originality and simplicity. It does not take a genius to follow the plot and is not like watching CSI or a murder mystery. This one is more like admiring a great book visually by enjoying the moments of humor, appreciating the twists, and applauding at the end. Bottom line, the story is wise and keeps you entertained. Guy Ritchie has done this enough number of times to establish a knack for it and he does not disappoint. Just a great story is not good enough, and if it was not for the cracking acting by the cast, nothing would live up the screen the way it does on this one.The chemistry between Jude Law and RDJ is flawless and is brilliant enough to make the real pair look fake. RDJ packs the punch, looks the part, times the moves and lines, and is the best portrayal of Sherlock so far in any movie or TV show. The characters all appear a natural part of the story and appear and disappear just as they would in a real setting. The sets and the setting, including the look and feel of all characters is true to its core and, even Stephen Fry is not bad with his cameo. The elevation in this definitely comes from Jared Harris. JH plays the professor and carries the character beautifully throughout the movie. He almost competes directly with RDJ both in character and screen presence and keeps the balance of having to wait till the end. Jude Law is charming as always, and complements the role in every aspect. Pick any movie within this genre and you will see how good all the characters jive on this one, because just seeing Sherlock would not have cut it.Then comes the cinematography, the visual effects, the action sequences, and the tiny details of critique that can be used to start ripping it apart. While each person liked, or hated the visual effects, each person is sure to agree on one thing, that this movie is intelligently made and acted, and the intent of telling a good story is clearly visible and felt. We all hate to see sequels just because the first one was a huge hit and the team just wanted to capitalize on it.Kudos with this one to the team and I cant wait to see another addition to this!",Null,1,2,18 January 2012
The Hangover Part II," The paradox of a sequel
","Following up on a outrageous success is a daunting task for any director and its a dilemma quite simply called 'sequel'. Most of the watchers in this case belong to the category of 'C'mon, its the hangover...its funny, what more do you expect?' Many who would care to critique would say its not as good as the first, and a few would love it even more and watch it again. Its a fork on the road for most directors when it comes to sequels unless you are the maker of Godfather 2 and there is a reason for that. A sequel could be continuation of a web already weaved by the story or it could be using the same framework to tell a new story. The later is more difficult if you care about success and applause.Hangover 2 belongs to the second category of sequels and Todd Philips has done a good job of staying true to the spirit and theme. He could easily have used his imagination to build new characters or offer new situations which you bet would have been like buying a lottery ticket. The movie is smart and sticks to a model of success created by the first hangover. For most people who complain its the same as first, they would have thrown more stones had it been a new story and a wash. At the end of the day what makes hangover worth watching is the characters we loved in one.The characters use the ramp up from one and they are likable as well as funny. Zack as Alan proves its not a one hit wonder while Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms are spot on! Mr Chow could have used some sharper editing but overall the movie sticks to a tight story without aberration. Mike Tyson could have taken a pass along with some other scenes which make you wonder the sky has been reached if that is the limit. The song by Ed Helms in the boat....yes an original again is a nice touch which reminds of hangover one and how funny these characters are.Thailand is not as good as Vegas and as with any sequel, it is a paradox of choice which is worthy of a watch!",Null,0,0,30 May 2011
Toy Story 3," Respect the Toy + Story!
","If you are a unique person like me, you have always heard great things about Toy Story movies but never actually sat down or decided to watch one. To make it even better, you probably have never watched the 1 and 2 but wanted to watch 3...if its a yes, I sure bet it was a heart warming experience and now you are adding 1 and 2 to your queue.Having watched minimal animated movies and a limited liking towards them, I asked myself not to lose interest through the ride but Toy Story proved to change all of that. It does not matter whether you already know the characters or not, this movie will immerse you into a sea of happiness and joy that will not just bring back all the memories as a kid, but it will elevate you to dream and always keep good things closer. The monumental characters like Woody and Buzz will remain and never grow older in your heart, and your imagination/interpretation of the emotions will bring tears of joy and attachment.The strength of the movie is more than just Woody and Buzz here. What makes it great is a culmination of some very creative thinking, pristine story telling, solid animation and perfect voice overs. And if you pay close attention, then this movie is not about Toys.....this story is about sticking and always being there..... told is a masterful way.Go watch it and respect the Toy + STORY!!",Null,0,0,23 May 2011
The Social Network," The new pulp fiction!
","Across the history of cinema, some of the most impactful and cult movies have had a few things in common. Their stories have surrounded a real world phenomena and the direction captured the essence of the story better than reality. The Social Network by all means is the cult classic of this generation.What happens when you put the combination of a story writer who has the expertise to convert real world stories into a even more powerful screenplay (Charlie Wilson's War, Few Good Men), and a director with the most astute skills of story telling (Fight Club, Seven, The Game) on a single project? The social network is nothing short of an explosive ride the pace of which will keep you on your toes and the dialogues will make you applaud consistently as it all unfolds. There is no suspense, no killer in the end or no treasure to be found yet it will keep you engrossed and remind you of the world around us. Its true that Aaron Sorkin had more than plenty for the story from the book, but it takes someone like him to make the movie look better than the book! And for David Fincher, he made fight club look casual with this. Every scene including the background music, locations, costumes and the look of the characters is nailed to perfection and it gets better than a courtroom drama without a court or the setting. The characters are the heart and execute the roles with solid punch and timing.Mark Zuckerberg can take lessons from Jesse Eisenberg on how to be Mark Zuckerberg in case he gets too busy and forgets what he was like! Jesse Eisenberg was born with this voice and speed of talk for this movie as he single handedly runs with the show through out the movie. Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake put in solid performances and even the Winklevoss twins are better than the real ones. Every bit of detail has been meticulous worked including the setting of Harvard and code that you see vaguely on the computer screens. Above all the dialogues of this drama are the most memorable and will continue to hit on you even with repeated watches.Nothing in this movie is extraordinary yet everything about it is a treat to watch! Cut to the chase....this is the new pulp fiction!",Null,0,1,1 June 2011
The Fighter," Another KO from Bale!
","After you watch the movie and get a glimpse of the real characters shown in the end, it will evoke an immediate applause in your mind for Christian Bale aka Dicky in the movie. The Fighter is yet another incredible true story that will touch upon a lot of spheres of life and relay inspiring thoughts very subtly. It does not pack the intensity or punches like other boxing movies, but will definitely make an impressive impact.The direction and screenplay are a clean cut and although there is very little wiggle room with any real story, it still manages to let a viewer derive their own likeness to the characters and draw inspiration through many scenes. Mark Wahlberg is a effortless natural through out the movie and the cast playing the family all do justice to their little roles. Amy Adams will grab your attention with her delivery and will prove her potential yet again how far she has come from Sex and the City. The story overall is not about a big comeback or about nail biting boxing matches, its about a spirit of fighting and the fighter here is Dicky.You may be a big Christian Bale fan or may have just heard about his crazy role preps for movies like Machinist, but make no assumptions or mistakes about this guy's performances. He proves yet again why he is Oscar material and goes way beyond just the look of a character. Bale is the heart beat of this drama and delivers all the punches outside the boxing ring. Just a couple scenes like his jumps in the trash and singing to his mother in the car display the ability of Bale to get sucked into a character. There is nothing extra ordinary about this story but the character of Dicky makes this more than worth watching.Its not just head and body, its head, body, and heart from Christian Bale to deliver another Knock Out! Go watch even if you have never heard of him",Null,0,0,23 June 2011
