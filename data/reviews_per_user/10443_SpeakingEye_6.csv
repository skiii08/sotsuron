Skyfall," We've been expecting more Mr Bond
","With every new release of a Bond film there are two predictable events. Firstly, that some journalist will proclaim it the best Bond ever. Secondly, that the marketing campaign for the film will be the equivalent of a continual sledge hammer hit over our heads for a full month with no hiding place. The result of these two events is that in the minds of the Bond fan and any other interested film goer that the film they are about to see had better be damned good.And so we have Skyfall. As you have seen through your perusal of the other hundred odd reviews, opinions vary from an absolute triumph to a colossal turkey. In my opinion it is neither as Skyfall is a mixed bag of a film. The plot is weak and changes tack half way through and the villain a poorly thought out one. However, in places the film shines from a script clearly written by intelligent writers as there are some really well delivered dialogue scenes. The action scenes are not particularly exciting and we are 'treated' to maybe the worst one in the series – the crashing of an empty tube at London rush hour. It also suffers from an M who is clearly past pensionable age and a supporting cast of forgettable characters (Q is a wise cracking 'yoof', Tanner a grey bureaucrat more suited to managing the staff car park etc.) The shining light is the introduction of Ralph Fiennes character who will be a big asset for many Bond films to come. So the best Bond film? Definitely not. Did it merit the relentless PR machine? Count the numbers and see. But it is possible to see a next film delivering more but only with the following provisos:1. The next film must be developed around a credible villain. The 'crazed individual' approach has had its day. There are plenty of villainous governments out there for Bond to fight against. Bringing back a SPECTRE style approach would also work as countries form alliances with each other. 2. Daniel Craig needs to learn how to do suave. Mr Craig brings everything to the Bond role except this and it makes for a poorer Bond. This aspect is important as it has always formed part of the reason why men want to be Bond and not the Terminator or Rambo. 3. Make the most of Ralph Fiennes – he is the only credible supporting character and is capable of making any scene involving for the viewer.There will always be a Bond and there will always be the machine that delivers it. The trick for those operating the machine is to deliver that special quality that makes us still want Bond fighting our battles. As Sheryl Crow once said, you are not the only spy out there.",Null,2,4,12 January 2014
American Hustle," Watch it and weep
","Spoiler alert – I really dislike films with improvised dialogue, in fact I downright hate them. Yes I know there is the odd gem like Spinal Tap but for the most part they just make cringe worthy viewing.American Hustle should have been a thing of genius. It has an excellent cast, great story (plot details are in the title), brilliant production design and attention to detail. So for this reviewer it is just a massive shame that the prior mentioned ingredients are ruined scene after scene by the cast's improvised dialogue.Instead of sharply observed insightful gripping scenes, we have the cast repeating the same thing three times just to make the point. When they don't know what to say, hell, they just say the first thing that comes into their heads. The worst part is that I don't know who to blame – the cast for arrogantly thinking they are script writers, the director for not taking a tougher stand or the producers for just allowing the thing to evolve in the way it did.American Hustle will win Oscars, not because it deserves to, simply because it has that awful thing called the big momentum. For me, it is simply the emperor's new clothes circa 1975.",Null,3,4,21 June 2014
Inside Out," Wearing The Inside Out
","Inside Out is a film clearly made with honourable intentions to portray the complexities of the human personality. The fundamental problem is that the film simply tries to pack in too many aspects; memory balls, memory islands, core memories, abstract thoughts, reality distortion filter, imaginary friends and characters representing different emotions. The overall effect is like an orchestra without a conductor all playing at the same time and between them drowning out all the good bits.Its a real shame as the family dynamic is cleverly constructed and the Riley character is a sweet engaging girl. Her struggles are the emotional core of the film but she is almost a supporting character in her own movie. The middle part of the films simply drags and overall the film really needed more of her and less of the cacophony of her noisy thought elements. The ending redeems the film and is a brilliant piece of film making, combining human fragility with the power of healing.Overall a classic example of Hollywood creative talents over thinking and over compensating an idea which needed a much simpler delivery.",Null,0,3,19 October 2019
The Woman in Black," A Crime Against Scary
","The Woman in Black has run for years and years as a successful stage play in the London West End. I have had the privilege of seeing it twice and each time the superb staging and acting has blown me away. The stage play is based on the classic 'less is more' theory and the moments of scary are limited to a few times but when they come they are nothing less than chilling and downright terrifying.By contrast, The Woman in Black film is not scary in the slightest and the basic reason why is that we are bombarded scene after scene with 'scary' faces and ghoulish spectres. It literally becomes a matter of going 'oh look another ghost and so what?' The location are well thought through but the haunted house is one giant cliché. The acting is OK but the script gives them very little to work with. Daniel Radcliffe seems a really nice chap but he was miscast as a tragic widower as he cannot muster any emotion beyond 'mild alarm'. Delivering such a poor film with such great source of material is one heck of a feat but the Hammer team manage to do this magnificently. The last great act of the Hammer Company was in 1980 with the TV Series 'Hammer House of Horror'. Most episodes were really scary and one in particular 'The Two Faces of Evil' was just about the scariest TV programme ever to grace our screens. I watched it as a 12 year old in 1980 and then as a 42 year old 30 years later. Both occasions were a thing of sleeping with the lights on afterwards. The Hammer team that made Woman in Black should all sit down and watch this episode and then hang their heads in shame.",Null,0,1,15 November 2014
Pitch Perfect 3," A Pitch Perfect Mess of a Film
","I am a huge fan of Pitch Perfect; it is that rare film where you can watch countless times and always be entertained by the brilliant cast, writing, songs and general feel good that surrounds a movie where all involved know they are creating something special.Pitch Perfect 2 pretty much drained all the good will I had for the series; a real let down.When I saw there was a Pitch Perfect 3 I was really suspicious but we movie fans are sentimental at heart; we want to see the good in a franchise that provided such a great first film. So I bought my ticket and then proceeded to watch what I confidently predict to be the worst film I will watch this year. Pitch Perfect 3 is a great example of how franchise owners foolishly believe that a returning cast can re-create magic time after time, even when given a lame plot, script and new weak supporting characters. This film only shows how wrong this approach is. The brilliant Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins are recycled, only this time with truly awful lines. Rebel Wilson was clearly considered by the producers to be a comic genius in the first film but clearly gave us her best lines (about 2 of them) back in the first film. Even Anna Kendrick cannot save this film. The basic problem is that in trying to go out on a high, the discipline of the first film is lost to self-indulgent terrible ad libbing and a weak plot centred around Wilson as an action hero.Ok so what would I have done differently? The re-uniting for the USO tour could have focused much more on cheering up battle scarred troops which would have added some much needed depth to the film. There could have been a great opening to the film starting with Beca visiting each character in their new ordinary lives to persuade them to return to the group. The DJ competition should have been ditched completely. They should also have paid any money to have Adam Devine and Skylar Astin to reprise their roles as their relationships with the girls provided so much to the first film's success. Aubrey's relationship with her father could also have been explored in much more depth and Fat Amy with a half decent script and solid soldier character support could have been the love interest this time.Despite all of the above, I will always be thankful to the cast and crew for bringing the original Pitch Perfect to the screen. It will always be a go to movie for when I need cheering up. I really hope that all concerned know that its time for the series to say goodbye.",Null,0,1,3 January 2018
Spectre," Goodbye Mr Bond
","Please do not read this review if you have not seen the film already Spectre continues the Bond tradition of a beautifully made film awash with glamorous locations, luxury cars, London & Rome at their finest and Monica Bellucci. As a spectacle it gives the casual viewer the basics needed from a Bond film.But what to make of Spectre from the Bond fan's perspective ? A likely last outing for Daniel Craig who demonstrates a Bond weary from previous events. Mr Craig in Spectre is a more considered Bond who now listens to reason, thinks before charging in and prefers to save the world wearing Tom Ford. There is also a wink from him to the audience of just how ludicrous the whole Bond as world saver is; witness the handy sofa in the pre-titles sequence, finding time to call the office during the Rome car chase and a finale almost copied from Grease. The Plot Spectre has a plot which on paper looked a fine piece of work by writers Logan Purvis Wade & Butterworth (LPWB). Bringing in a shadowy empire ruled by a despot, whilst a giant cliché in the Bond franchise, at least reflected our current global world which in reality is controlled by a handful of giant corporations (who supply our phone, coffee, shopping and internet browsing). The problem unfortunately for LPWB is that the plot unravels before our very eyes as we watch Spectre portrayed in the film pretty much as a team of bumbling incompetents led by a man dressed in posh carpet slippers. Christophe Waltz whilst starting out well, gradually goes downhill as an evil mastermind and by the end we are almost laughing at his ineptitude. It also did not help that Waltz decided to make adverts in the UK at the same time resulting in the supposed head of an evil empire also convincing us to buy broadband.The Girl Spectre also brings Bond a new love interest. Bond has essentially fallen in love in 3 of his 26 missions. The first was with Tracy (OHMSS) who represented the finest ever Bond girl to the point that it is almost an insult to describe her as one. Any self- respecting Bond fan knows just how influential she has been to the series which has reflected in both direct or indirect references to her in at least 5 Bond films up to TWINE ('have you ever lost a loved one Mr Bond?'). The second was with Vesper Lynd who whilst not as rounded a character as Tracy was at least involving enough to the viewer in that we mourned her passing with Bond. The big problem with Spectre is that Bond falls in love for the third time, this time with Madeline, but LPWB do not spend any time developing her character so we essentially do not care about either her or the love affair. Madeline is maudlin, aloof and we do not understand what Bond sees in her. The Car Note to the Bond team; the reason why the DB5 has remained the ultimate Bond car is that it was not unceremoniously dumped in a river 10 minutes after its first car chase. This film's Aston Martin never had a real chance to prove itself a classic.Other forgettable moments The casting of the wrestler Bautista who smirks in every scene as though he cannot believe his good fortune at landing the role. He simply has no presence and this is really evident during the Q scene on the cable car when a similar henchman sits opposite him and fixes him an expressionless look of an assassin. The actor playing the role brings a real sense of menace in these 2 minutes versus Bautista's silly grin but sadly the scene ends before real drama can be played out. Blowfeld's evil lair is also something out of Austin Powers and is so hopelessly under fortified that Bond destroys it within 2 minutes. The finale is a Die Hard rip off without any suspense. Torture scene was inappropriate and parents who consider to let their children watch Bond films (let's face it, we all watched Bond as kids) will definitely need to fast forward through the dentist chair scene.The Theme Great song by Sam Smith but sadly Sam let slip that he wrote it in 20 minutes. At least an hour would have suggested you needed a second go at it.The Heritage One truly admirable aspect of the Broccoli & Wilson (B&W) stewardship of the Bond canon is their dedication to preserving the Fleming heritage. Witness the small but highly involving scene filmed in Rules restaurant with M and the supporting players. Only in a Bond film would there be such a pause for reflection, amongst the explosions, in the heart of Fleming/Bond's Mayfair London. If Daniel Craig does walk away, he can be very proud of his contribution to the series. The problem for B&W is how on earth does Bond remain relevant in a world where the real villains are nothing that Fleming wrote about. James Bond will return but whether he the man needed to take on today's problems is anyones guess.",Null,2,4,20 March 2016
