United 93," Literally a revelation
","This movie is a stunning achievement. I sat down half way through the movie and began to watch with only moderate interest at first. What I realize only now is how brilliant the portrayal of these events is. The story of 9/11 speaks for itself and Paul Greengrass honors it in the deepest sense possible by adding...NOTHING. A cast of unknown and relatively unknown actors delivers a collection of some of the most compelling and honest performances I have ever seen. I cannot speak enough about how realistic the portrayals looked, sounded and felt throughout the film. When the movie suddenly ended after the most intense crescendo, I sat blank for a moment. And then I literally burst into tears. 9/11 has placed an indelible mark on the consciousness of the World and this movie represents the ultimate retelling of one facet of that story.",10,2,4,5 February 2008
