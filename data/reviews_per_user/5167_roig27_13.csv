Casablanca," Casablanca, Marroco
","As soon as the flight takes off from Finland Alvar Aalto will deconstruct your brain in pure Iceland: Cold may be your flu! The plot is: A secret mission: ENIGMA. You will get along with all these people in America: According to Latin, the alphabet is composed of 'letters' differentiated by forms: The A is not the Z is not the P. The famous case of Jacques Emile Lacan: Three orders ruled his universe: The Real. the Symbolic, the Imaginary. They are: Impossible, social, poetic. Jacques Lacan, do not forget. He is the central figure of the Platonic dialog if you count Descartes or Rue Descartes next to College de France in Paris, France. Nancy Wood, my professor at Cornell Unievrsity, gave me an F at a course entitled: -Crimes against Humanity: Cinematic Memories-. Like Charlie Chaplin, you will fly away in this classic 20th Century film. A most distinguished accomplishment!",10,1,2,6 June 2008
The English Patient," I don't want to die in the desert.
","An excellent movie as the -COMA- police: It will wipe your balls on fire as it will take your Lacanian Imaginary into new heights: No Football here people, this is the Real. Imagine Borges in steroids lifting Shakespeare into a pool of Frenc academicians: The result is this Zen film of intelligent craft. Lifting your Symbolic will help your popcorn if you accompanier this with Pepsi: If you do otherwise your, with success, acrobats will result into a complete gain of 100%. The product does not want to die in the desert: It must sell to make money from paper: It is facultative of the people to buy or sell: As long as they move, the product will go with the sale to the beach and together they will join into a -COSMOS- around and fully loaded of Jacques Lacan's three orders of the human mind: The Iamginary, the Symbolic, and the Real. Watch your space-balls, people, this one is a hit!",10,4,7,7 June 2008
Alien," the ferry-fellers- masterstrokes
","Thsi is an excellent movie. Its movements are slow, spades, spasmodic, very sexy. Voluptous, cherry, sensual ... It is a hit! It goes slow: The jelly in your stomach will never stop moving: Catch it and run. Akira Kurosawa, the master, would have loved to ate this one but it was already produced in the Chinese tense: present, past and future, it's all a flan. The secret of this movie is as follows: The people in the Boat (no relation to Cornell University, they speak in secret because they are perverts) are so scared of their aborting a secret mission because it involves an extraterrestial crew that seems to be particularly active: It swallows humans. If you liked -INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS-, watch it! This master 20 Century classic movie, will film your verbs like Pipi Longstocking will jump down from that Budha tree: Buddha was not G. Patton! The tense means to say G. Patton was not Pato, lest Plato. You will love this aliensL: They are bad as Hell!",10,0,1,6 June 2008
Battleship Potemkin," Who won?
","This film is excellent. The stairs at the B & W shots will stop your carriages at the 'wild' caravan of wild strawberries, a final and census, albeit colorless, tour de force on movement. If you suffer from cerebral palsy and cannot move from your wheelchair, buy a home stereo, stretch your legs with -PETROLEUM JELLY- and stick your fingers in, you are off! When I was a student at Hunter College the year 1986 to the year 1987 I wrote a corporatist study between 'Battleship Potemkin' and 'Young Mr. Lincoln' overstraining in automatic writing the effects of history in the moving image industry and how much that costs for the imaginary of an ambition. Me at Auburn, New York watching LOST IN SPACE the year 1998 thought: 'Where is Truman Capote's laundry, at which one of the universities?' The University of Moscow is not Cornell University, for example. A strawberry from Finland is not a strawberry from France, for example, a kiwi from Praha is not sold the same way as the kiwi from New Zealand is sold at the local supermarket, or else you are tripping on ice, or you are picking up eggs in Red Square.",10,0,0,14 November 2009
Taxi Driver," ibm
","I like your entrance. This film will make your balls fire! In the Emperor's name, he rescues a child female prostitute from the streets of New York City! If Ed could act it... I believe people should be placed under arrest for prostitution... You will have to produce the evidence. The main actress in the film is taken b the 'Taxi Driver', an Orpheus-like Hercules who never shaves his head because he is out of competition with the streets of New York City! If you knew... Who would have guessed that people feel empowered by the streets of New York City! I like the last scene shot at a private apartment with stairs! The taxi driver comes in and says: 'Are you speaking to me?' The resolution of the film is excellent: excellent cinematography, excellent photography, excellent costumes, excellent music, et cetera. Finally the mother was sold for ten (10) dollars at a bus stop, รก-la Rosa Parks with the difference that Jodie Foster is white and not black. Confused about the negative and positive? Check out these signs: - +.",10,0,1,12 July 2010
Grease," hizo una bonita labor con Maggie ...
","This is the best movie I have ever seen! Grease your hair and get into this punky movie: it's a remake of the modern industrial revolution. Actors John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, both acclaimed classic actors, recount their encounter of a summer, the most romantic summer they have ever had. The soundtrack is fun, safe, sane, well taken care of in the distribution of the musical notes. One of the most intelligent scenes is at the house where there is a well staged scene of a 'pajama party'. The boy though is not feature in the 'pajama party': he is racing cars -a la REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE-, an error of the movie perhaps. The final scene is a -rock opera- enthusiast of safe entertainment: the boy though is not well is those black leather pants, but the overall scenery is acceptable. Take it with Pepsi and popcorn.",8,1,2,21 December 2008
The Shining," Wild Strawberries
","This is an excellent film. Forcast portraits will follow your imagination, fantasy, your power. It will render you to your feet. J. N. will forever live in your imagination. Your imagination will forever live in this beautiful movie. The work of the cast is excellent. The day after you will feel groovy but take it easy, this is an intelligent move: 'Wake up, Danny ... wake up ....' The young tender child, Daniel, reads in the mirror: REDRUM. The red used in the cinematography is one of the finest I have experienced. The score is high: the parents are divorced, and the mother is a tinkle: the father is a writer-Psycho (from here, the world of poetry and fiction): they brake loose in an abandoned castle in the Eastern section of Budapest. Look out for the final scenes when Danny outruns his daddy in the labyrinth. Icelandic, poetic, beautiful: this is a hit.",9,1,2,28 January 2008
The Elephant Man," Nothing will die.
","This is an excellent film. Set in the style of _Murder on the Orient Express_ this Tudor movie is a classic of XX Century cinematography. Director David Lynch known for _Eraserhead_, his first cult film, is at his best in this affective tale of a deformed man of aristocratic origins. He goes to the Opera, the Ballet, the Teatre, the Modern Dance production and meet many people on his way to the Patis M'etro. This film in B & W is affective: Effectively, it is smash, a hit in tenderness, a success in cash. You will love it. The other productions of Director Lynch, _Dune_, _Paris, Texas_, _Blue Velvet_ are masterpieces: Anne Bancroft, of the Bancroft family of New York City, is in her best role as the Opera singer: Not to be confused with the Hitlerian singer-machine from the State of Vaticano: You will fly away in it.",9,0,0,14 June 2008
The Fly," The fly
","The Fly, of the same title as the book by Jean Paul Sartre The Flies, with actors in it, is an excellent movie. The first one did not go through now the second one will go through: watch it with popcorn and Pepsi and even your kid will laugh its piggy-ass off. At Cornell University I watched the year 1996 the film -Au revoir les enfants-: you will want to review the book -The Day of the Locust- when all the flies fly to the New England, Mid-West and Western states: if you understand this with the other classic -Altered States- you will fall again in your piggy ass. Watch it with you aunt Tita along a beauty ride at the magic Mountain at Walt Disney World antiques: Dracula will scare your piggy ass O.K. but I believe this one in negative will fly you to new heights.",9,0,3,31 January 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," Why were you crying?
","I can cry a river over you...this butterfly effect is superb. -CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND- is impossible because this Catholic film will satisfy your seeds: set in rural Alabama, the prologue or -OPENING LOGOS- is the anti-chambers of the C.I.A. -the F.B.I.- a complex system of -ALTERED STATES-. 50 people get together in a trunk and decide to end the dispute over who is going to be the driver of the Van: Halen? They are known as the -CHARLES MASON FAMILY- a group of filmmakers who are positive in the camera: How is your lasagne at Champs Elys'ee, for example? People who travel are like that: old money, f-f, this is accepted in Casablanca: you trade your 17 and with success you will win. If you do not win (meaning: if you make an error) you loose. The gain? It depends: if you are a King and bet your kingdom, and you win, you win securities for your kingdom. If you are an Emperor, and you win, you win securities for your Empire. If you are a Prince, and you win, you win securities for your Principality. Now, if you are a gambler and you only have your tail to bet, you have to win: otherwise, you will loose your tail. And so forth: the rules are explicit in every move and every move on its turn is gathered by light: it is the continental theory.",10,0,0,19 December 2008
The Deer Hunter," Before you go...
","This is an excellent film. Full of emotions, affects, effects, F/X, the film will swallow you! Bring your cigarettes, Pepsi and do not even think of having drugs with Popcorn! The closest (I. B. M.) KFC is at your hands! Rise them, have a chicken! Who wants to shoot you? Who's gun is this? This movie is of the highest intelligence ... it was even categorized by the I. B. M. as being part of Project Seti, the (SETHI) program of paper ... read your -THE NEW YORK TIMES- in your toilette as they are spare: lest you are optional. Read on and you will crash in your briefs ... if you thought Santa Claus was funny? Think of Satan and you will turn white ... what a *F! The whole movie is fascinating, intriguing, a borderline historico-fantasy drama of -alto- musical classical score ... saveloy back on shore I said to my domestic partner: Cookie, here, it is not optional!",10,0,2,5 December 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," We the peo ...
","Hold on to your music as symphonic poetry will echo in your mind as this epic unravels. This is the first of a tri-cyclical trilogy: the first of three which ends in -The Return of the Jedi-. CH? You will love the score, the atmosphere and you will cry also with the story and situation: in a remote galaxy, an unbalanced force has intent to destroy the Empire. From the -Death Star- Darth Vader as President of Commands directs his people with the armies of a 'Lady of Iron': the Troy-Horses used during the Middle Ages to contain revolt of masses and that were expanded to the public with what History have come to know up the Twetieth Century, chambers of torture: in one episode, Luke escapes with his armies -regal- from a compressor of junk! The cinematography is excellent yet close to the end of the movie when SS Luke is about to destroy the Star of Death and hears the voice of O.B. 1 murmur to him to trust his instincts that a choral voice-over interrupts the final act to announce: 'We did it'.",9,0,0,14 January 2008
Ran," sleep
","The last masterpiece of acclaimed filmmaker A. Kurosawa. The cinematography is stupendous, magnificent, splendid, expansive: Ran if you can backwards or into the past. It's only competition: -BACK TO THE FUTURE-. Fly into these fantastic settings of imagination: Dwellings as high as the Atlantic Ocean floor, your Volvo will dream in Cornell University: Your Audi will fly in Cornell University, you will feel as in Tibet. At this movie you will crouch tiger, and hide dragons: Fire! -SPACEBALLS- is little comparable to this epic: The map of the Oceans is unfinished, it will never end because it is impossible for humans to breath as fish or it Steve Martin: -IF ON A WINTER'S NIGHT A TRAVELLER- knocks on your door, open the doors. Unless and unfortunately you are afraid somebody might hurt you because you are not Catholic: Yet the LAW says they must be maintained ands since we live in uncertain times, where there are no rules, contradictory laws and no clear consensus as to what should be done, the People's Republic of China established contact with President Richard Nixon et al. Since the wonton soup ...",10,0,3,8 June 2008
