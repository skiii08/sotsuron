Deja Vu," we are people.we have different tastes.
","I saw this movie just now ...but in fact i saw it 4 days ago...i didn't like it and i would like to do some changes.is it possible? i do not know but with this movie you gonna see that there is a chance to change it.It looks crazy and confusing but is a simple movie with deep thinking.at least the idea to make a movie in this way. The movie its about everything , little bit from all. Its not boring.Far away from that. someone wrote here that he or she went with some friends and didn't like the movie.Maybe i can take the grandma from my gf to see it together.Sure she will not understand think from the movie but this doesn't mean the movie its bad , it can be that lady could be too old... if you like some action,little bit about love and nice and new idea in a movie just do it! if you don't like such movie go see some TV serials like Young and restless??? :)",9,0,1,10 December 2006

","Many people are and many tastes. If people enjoyed this film for real i cant say nothing to them, but i guess there are still people out who judge a movie about how awful is it means excellent.How much you don't understand from it how better it is.It reminds me of a good story about the king with the invisible clothes(better said naked). No one dare to say that the king was naked because it means that he or she was stupid.About this movie: in my opinion if you don't have imagination for yourself, and if you want what a man has inside his head before he goes to sleep just watch this bunch of nonsense toughs...",1,26,58,17 August 2010
