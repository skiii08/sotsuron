Blade Runner 2049," A great sequel
","35 years on from it's predecessor, Blade Runner 2049 was never still a thought on anyone's mind. Well, okay, maybe die hard fans of the original but other than that pretty much nobody. It was a big risk for a project such as Blade Runner 2049 to happen, especially considering the audience and landscape of the film industry have changed a lot. I had never seen the original Blade runner before this was announced, but I was also instantly intrigued. It looked totally amazing. About 1 to half a year on and having seen the original film (What? You think I'm a scrub?) I went and saw the film. It was enthralling, great characters looked beautiful, and had a great story. It was a standout and maverick in the endless list of superhero movies (Which are still great) and the very safe, family friendly Star Wars films. I thought it would explode at the box office. How could no one not go and see this film? It had great critical reviews, great first opinions, and appealed to a large audience. But then, the box office figures were released. 33.8 million worldwide. To put that into comparison, Star Wars Rogue One made 1.056 billion worldwide not including toys and merchandise. That it a HUGE flop when a film has makes only about 17% back of its budget. But now, in retrospect, it makes sense. It was a film targeted at adults (and not something you could go see as a date-type of film like Deadpool or any comedy), it was risky, and it was too complicated for any normal human being. Sadly we live in a world where people do not want to think. They will take the nearest comedy or superhero movie that they can just enjoy themselves at. The films nominated for the Oscars are literally never even heard about till they get a nomination. It's sad to see a film so intricate and says something about humanity go to waste like that. That said, the cultural impact was significant and in the end, the best thing to have as a filmmaker is fans.So in conclusion. Go see Blade Runner 2049, watch the first film first of course. But I am sure that you will enjoy it from the comfort of your sofa. It is a great film and a cinematic masterpiece. And really is a worthy sequel to the original.",9,4,9,3 March 2018
Your Name.," A brilliant piece of art.
","Kimi No Na Wa (or Your Name in english) is an amazing film that takes you on an emotional roller coast through it. The story has been meticulously crafted, even when your confused you feel it still makes sense. The characters are deep, emotional characters and feel very real. By the end of the film you feel all kinds of emotions. It also looks amazing. The style and animation are flawless and feel perfect. My only complaint with this film would be its ending (I will not spoil it). But other than that it is a masterpiece and I implore you to watch it if you a fan of Anime or just films in general.",10,2,3,1 March 2018
