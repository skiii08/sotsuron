Lucky Number Slevin," Slevin Kelevra!
","OK, I have seen this movie about 8 or 9 times now and feel it's about time I comment on it! I haven't ticked the spoilers box because this is the kind of movie you just don't want to ruin for anyone else! All I will say is that this is one fantastic movie with a fantastic twist! The acting is first class (even Lucy Lieu) and the script is great! Greatly directed and superbly noir this movie should be seen by everyone at least once! See it!I have never really been a Josh Hartnet fan, although I have always been a Bruce Willis fan (apart from Hudson Hawk) but I really can't fault ANY of the actors in this movie!",10,6,7,14 December 2008
The Hangover," Best Hangover ever!
","I saw this movie as part of a promotional drive! I have to say that when I first heard of it, I just assumed that it would be another 'Dude Where's My Car' or 'Sex Drive' but I have to say I was thankfully wrong and pleasantly surprised! If you are expecting a movie with a superb script and a brilliant acting display, then go and watch something else as this will disappoint you! But if you are looking for a no-nonsense, simple, hilarious and brilliant comedy then get your money out and go see this! I can't remember laughing so much for ages! The Mike Tyson cameo was pure comedy genius! :) I gave this movie 9/10 :)",9,6,13,30 May 2009
Knowing," Close Encounters Of The TURD Kind!
","OK, I want to say I liked this movie! But I didn't! I also want to say that I hated this movie! But I didn't! What I WILL say is that up until about 1hr 40mins (of a 2hr 1min movie) I was pleasantly surprised! THEN....It turned into an episode of Southpark meets Roswell! If you are expecting a movie that crosses 'Signs' with ' Close Encounters Of The Third Kind' with 'The Mothman Prophesies' with 'War Of The Worlds' and 'The Day After Tomorrow' then this is for you! The CGI was some of the least realistic CGI I have ever seen! Especially the train crash scene! But If you want a movie with a little substance and good acting, then I would give this a miss! I rate this movie 5 out of 10! And it only gets that because it started off OK!",5,0,1,12 August 2009
Gran Torino," Grand Movie-o
","Clint Eastwood has contributed some fine directing to the movie world in the past few years so I knew I was going to be in for a thought provoking 2 hours but this movie proves that he is still more than capable of holding his own against some of the younger Hollywood stars IN FRONT of the camera as well! Gran Torino is a masterpiece of sheer class! One of the best movies I have seen in about 5 years.Clint plays Walt, a racist and grumpy ex-Korean war vet who lives on his own as the only white man in an Asian neighbourhood. One night he gets caught up in fight between the the family next door and the local gang.What follows is something that will make you think and bring a little smile to your face.Matt",9,2,5,9 April 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Not Scary
","There are a lot of comments on here saying that 'Raimi has created a masterpiece' and that this is a 'Truly Scary Horror'.... Well let me just say that although it is a very welcome return to horror for Sam Raimi, this is not a very scary movie.The film itself is OK, it has an OK story and the acting/screenplay seemed pretty solid but if you are a die hard horror fan like me, you won't find this scary! However if you are easily scared and hide behind the sofa when you see the movies that the Sci Fi channel show then you might find this a bit disturbing! The story starts off a little similar to Stephen Kings 'Thinner' but goes off in a completely different direction.If you liked movies such as 'The Grudge' and 'Lost Souls' then this is for you.I gave this movie 7/10",7,0,2,3 June 2009
