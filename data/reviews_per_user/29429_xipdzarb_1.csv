Men in Black 3," Disposable Stupidity
","I am terribly disappointed in this movie.Don't get me wrong, I did like the first two ones - the first movie is a classic! Now, in the third installment of the series, the whole movie seems like a very hasty product of an idle mind. The very first thing that you notice is that the main actors seem very tired and dull. Will Smith, otherwise being a very funny and classic character, seems now burnt out with his red eyes and gawky acting. Tommy Lee is - like he should - very much expressionless. It's part of his style and the style of the movie, but this time it just seems like a worn-out joke.The story is uninteresting and the plot is full of illogicalities. I'm not questioning time travel in itself, but how it turns out is very unrealistic. The whole thing with J being the only one who remembers K is just a big facepalm, and the time 'jump' ... Sigh, the plot is from a children's cartoon! There are far too many stupid things in the movie to list, here.The musical score and the general sound landscape is almost nonexistent. There are no nice melodies or songs that would support the movie. When the two agents are sitting in a car, the car makes no sound whatsoever. Also, the CGI could be much better. (If you don't agree, check out the part where the J and the large fish are fighting - looks like an animation from the 90's.) I don't have anything positive to say about this movie. The plot is bad, the acting is bad, music is bad ... It was a waste of time to watch this movie and I got depressed after seeing it, thinking how bad the 'art' of today has become. Maybe I want to join the aliens on a distant planet, because this planet is (almost) full of disposable stupidity.",1,4,10,24 October 2012
