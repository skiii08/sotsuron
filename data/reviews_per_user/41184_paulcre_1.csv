Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What a let down.
","What a let down, this film could have been so much more. It seems that they spent all there time and effort on special effects and making Jar Jar Binks annoying and not on the story line & characters. The first three films had their own atmosphere and appearance whereas Episode 1 has no atmosphere and the usual glossy appearance.",1,0,1,24 July 2001
