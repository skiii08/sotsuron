Blade Runner 2049," One of the spectacles of the year
","Darkness, rain, empowering adverts, Asian food and a question of identity and humanity. Yes, we certainly are back in the world of Blade Runner.It is 30 years since the events of Blade Runner but the sun-starved, murky, 'dystopian' Los Angeles still remains just to a larger scale than before.This time around, Ridley Scott takes a step back into executive producer, bringing Prisoners and Arrival director Denis Villeneuve to the hot seat.But much like the original, it's the grand design and blanketing sound is what grasps you by the collar and rattles you. The iconic soundtrack of the original 1982 sci-fi masterpiece – courtesy of composer Vangelis – is reincorporated this time around by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch and immediately you are engulfed back into this estranged world.It would be difficult to delve too far into the story-line given the complexity and any potential for spoilers, but there is a definite progression from the original whilst also keeping every inch of quality the Scott's 1982 masterpiece possessed.Nevertheless, Ryan Gosling takes the role of Officer K (or KD6-3.7 to be precise) – a Blade Runner tasked to hunt down bio-engineered humans known as 'replicants'.It's some leap for Gosling to go from all singing and dancing in La La Land to an environment completely unknown to him as he takes on his first sci-fi role. It's testament to this incredible actor that he can indulge his audience in every product he touches through the unique emotion he can portray simply through a bland facial expression.And Blade Runner 2049 is certainly a movie that has its audiences emotionally invested in – it isn't the standard sci-fi action-er that passes by. There's a lot of attention and concentration needed to grapple through the story-line and its characters.This film wasn't made for anyone, but for fans of the original – of which its base grew over time and as a result is now considered one of the greatest movies of its time.Villeneuve is rapidly becoming a genius of our generation and he seamlessly continues this world with all the traits of the original. Blade Runner captures everything that was brilliant about its predecessor, expertly blending the film noir and sci-fi elements almost creating its own unique genre.It's a slow burner, but through the vast panning shots of a vast 'dystopian' universe and the smothering soundtrack, you can't help but be constantly taken aback by this immense spectacle.Another element of the original that remains is Harrison Ford's character of Deckard who although features less than anticipated, is an integral part to the story and Ford nails the performance as expected despite his initial concerns of featuring in the sequel.One red mark against the film would be its length however. At two hours and forty- four minutes, it exceeds the threshold and there are plenty of moments throughout the movie that could be cut just to help make it more comfortable for its audience.That said, this should take nothing away from what an incredibly deserved sequel Blade Runner 2049 is. It is a movie that will live long in the memory of fans of the original and it exceeds expectations with Villeneuve pulling off another masterpiece in his already impressive catalogue of products.",Null,3,9,6 October 2017
Now You See Me," Magic without the spell binding finish
","Now You See Me sees four magicians with individual skill sets brought together by a mysterious superior who sets them up for three elaborate crimes which involve stealing mass amounts of money from various sources. The group are labelled as the Four Horsemen and consist of Jesse Eisenburg's cocky illusionist and his former assistant stunt-woman Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson's mind reader and Dave Franco's slide of the hand trickster.Whilst the magicians are busy tricking their way into bank vaults and accounts, tough guy cop Mark Ruffalo alongside Melanie Laurent, struggle to bring them to justice despite additional help from a professional magic trick exploiter (Morgan Freeman). For much of the feature, Now You See Me offers mass entertainment from the tricks being played out in front of your eyes to the thrilling cat and mouse chases. In addition, the highly impressive cast offer a strong comical and engaging dialogue. However, where the film disappoints is the lack of a strong finish, leaving you with a promising twist but also a complicated, flat finale. What's more is the over elaborate special effects where the film tries too hard to impress on a visual scale. As a result, a promising story line with an impressive cast is somewhat ruined by a very weak ending. Now You See Me certainly has its moments of wonder and entertainment, but lacks a spell binding edge to make it anything more than a good watch.#WebbersRatings = 7/10 http://rosswebber.tumblr.com/",7,0,1,29 July 2013
Whiplash," A Powerful and Tense Examination of Some Harsh Lessons
","Damien Chazelle's Whiplash follows the story of a young and talented drummer studying at Schaffer academy in New York. The film expertly observes the pressures and stresses of working under such a manipulative director.Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) is a 19 year-old student, gifted with the sticks in his hand. The film opens with him practising his drumming and is a clear indication of how ambitious and determined he is. After impressing Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons), the director of the leading ensemble in the school, Neyman is promoted into the band. Here is where he discovers the strict conditions of working under the perfectionist Fletcher. Insults regarding his mother who ran away when he was young and having chairs thrown at him isn't what Neyman expected.However, he remains strong and as determined as ever to prove that he can be a great, continuing to practise at every opportunity, literally playing until his hands are blistering and bleeding.Whiplash ultimately becomes a clash of two musical geniuses striving for perfection, illustrating the pressures and tensions to the extent where the audience are expecting either one to crack at any stage. Chazelle keeps the film strongly in the shadow of Neyman, tracking every single strain and emotion with the camera spending a lot of the time behind the shoulder of Neyman. Tempo is a major theme throughout the film in relation to the jazz numbers on the soundtrack which all make for an enthralling watch.Teller and Simmons both deliver perfect performances. Teller, who is certainly coming of age, manages to truly reflect the development of Neyman, not only as a drummer, but also as a person. Teller spends the majority of the film in all kinds of pain; either sweating, bleeding or crying and he delivers every possible emotion his character endures.Simmons standing in the opposite corner also perfects the role of the cynical, terrifying director, constantly pushing his band for perfection in the most intimidating approach possible. His quips and insults leave the audience wondering whether to laugh or sit in a state shock.Whiplash is a dark and pulsating watch, which deservedly left Sundance with two awards under its arm. With the Oscar nominations just around the corner, it would be no surprise to see a number of honours coming the way of Chazelle's creation.",9,0,1,11 January 2015
