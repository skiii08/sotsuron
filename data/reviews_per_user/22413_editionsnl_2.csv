Hereditary," Just horrifically boring.
","Literally one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen. Now, granted, I'm not really into paranormal stuff, so this probably wasn't going to be my type of movie anyway. But it was so hyped up as scarier than Midsommar (which I've just seen in theatres and really enjoyed), and it was available on Netflix, so I decided to give it a shot.The acting was pretty good and the characters were fairly interesting, which is the only reason it's even getting 3 stars. The plot was incredibly bland and predictable, even leaving out the paranormal stuff. I found absolutely no part of this film to be even mildly scary. I had trouble to focus at parts, and at no point did I feel immersed in what was happening. There was also very, very little significant character development for anyone, which I found disappointing as some of the characters had potential to be very engaging. The ending was almost laughably farfetched, even for a paranormal movie. All in all, I feel like I've wasted a few hours of my life. I understood the plot, btw, just didn't find it particularly engaging, interesting or original.",3,0,5,10 July 2019
Point Break," 8.2/10
","*Note: I haven't seen the original version of this movie. Plot: 7/10. FBI agent who also happens to be an extreme sports athlete infiltrates a group of extreme sports athletes who also happen to be eco-terrorists hellbent on completing the Ozaki 8 ordeals, a set of extreme sports ordeals, while also 'giving back' to Mother Earth (read: committing crimes) and trying to save the planet from destruction. Have to say, this is by far one of the most original and inventive plots I've come across for a crime movie. Points off for a couple instances of poor executions/research (I study terrorism, so I pick up on this easily in these movies): 1. Bodhi telling Utah that he 'knew he was a cop from the beginning, but thought he could save him' - this would NEVER happen in any extremist group ever. I get that they weren't a terrorist group in the original movie, but if you want to make them terrorists, you have to change the way you do things a little. 2. The whole thing about Bodhi being on the boat with Ozaki when he died, I mean... sure, it gives him motivation, but could we be any more predictable? 3. The romantic subplot between the girl and Utah was literally thrown in there for the sake of it and added nothing whatsoever to the plot. Furthermore, the one 'important' female character was literally a sexy lamp and didn't participate in any of the group's activities until it came time for her to die for the male lead to have feels. 4. Another instance of 'these weren't initially terrorists but they are now' poor execution: not that I don't understand that he wanted to complete the Ozaki 8, but no terrorist ever would just do something he knew was going to kill him without benefit to his cause. Again, maybe this was believable in the original movie, but it is not believable here. Characters: 7/10. I loved the character chemistry between Bodhi and Utah. Points off for no development of literally any other character. Especially in the case of Sexy Lamp lady who croaks for Man Tears. Cinematography: 10/10. Absolutely visually stunning movie. This is definitely the high point of the film, especially for the extreme sports fans among us. Atmosphere: 8/10. Pretty standard action movie atmosphere. Music: 9/10.Overall score: 8.2/10",8,0,1,7 December 2017
