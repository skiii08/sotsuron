Airlift," Historic Airlift..... One of India's best movie ever..... Akshay Kumar is just awesome He's the Best
","What a beautiful gift to the Indian Cinema by Akshay Kumar, Raja Menon & the whole team of Airlift. The story of biggest human evacuation told amazingly well. Its so good from the start to end that you can feel what condition those 1,70,000 Indians would have gone through. Clap, clap & clap in the end that's what me & the whole theater was doing.Akshay Kumar as Ranjit Katiyal was just awesome he has taken his acting to another level with this one. Salute to him for doing amazing & inspirational movies like OMG, Holiday, Baby, Gabbar & now Airlift. Nimrat Kaur as his wife was just too good, her scene with Prakash Belawadi is awesome & clap worthy. Purab Kohli, Kumud Mishra & especially Prakash Belawadi were too good.Direction by Raja Menon is fabulous he has done a great work in researching this true story.Feeling so proud to be an Indian & realized what great thing my country India has done for all of us. Salute to all those unsung heroes of this biggest human evacuation ever.And Thank You to the whole team of Airlift for this historic movie. One of India's best ever.",10,49,66,22 January 2016
