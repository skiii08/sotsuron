The Blair Witch Project," Over-hyped garbage
","<ul><li>CONTAINS SPOILERS -</li></ul>This movie was surrounded by quite a lot of hype when it came out. I am sad to say that for me, this movie failed to live up to its expectations in a big way. I have seen it twice now, and I got more scared watching 'Junior' with Schwarzenegger than I did watching 'The Blair Witch Project'. The biggest issue I have with this film is one I have with many sub-par horror flicks; the characters act totally irrational and stupid, and as the movie went on, I started cheering for whatever was hunting the characters. I felt no sympathy for them, and frankly could not wait for them to be punished for their stupidity. Examples: A) One of the characters purposely throws away their map. B) When they realize something is hunting them, they still continue log around all their equipment, in stead of discarding everything except the bare essentials in order to be able to move faster. C) The characters are scared out of their mind and they come to a house in ruins with strange figures outside it. In stead of bypassing it, they f_ucking go in. (At this point I not only wanted the thing to kill them, I wanted Jack Bauer to jump in and torture them first!) D) The whole time they are being hunted they never put down the camera. I know that the point-of-view thing is the whole concept of the movie, but it is just so unrealistic that a person in fear of his life will continue to film, in stead of picking up something to defend himself with. All in all I give the movie 3/10 because of its originality and clever marketing.",3,1,3,28 July 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," I'm too old for this sh*t
","I still consider myself a young man. I am 23, but every once in a while I realize that I am getting older. Back when I was a teenager I probably would have found this movie entertaining to some degree, but not now. The movie contains blood and gore ad libitum and clearly the special effects and make up teams had to earn their keep on the movie, but the story is both stupid and predictable, containing all the horror movie clich√©s from 'bad guy being more stealthy than an F117', 'good guys failing to realize that staying together might be their best option, deciding instead to split up at every possible moment', and of course the classic 'bad guy has been blown up, shot, stabbed, beaten, and burned yet rises again for one last fight'. If you simply want blood, gore, and cheap (very cheap!) thrills then this movie might be for you, but if you looking for a little more to rattle your cage, then do pass on this garbage.",3,0,2,21 April 2007
Once Upon a Time in America," Not Leone's best
","I know some people consider this to be Leone's best movie. I must say I strongly disagree. The acting in the movie is solid, would you expect otherwise looking at the cast. The story, however, is another matter. The movie is based on a book, and it shows. Despite lasting more than 220 minutes the movie still leaves a lot of characters very underdeveloped. The fact that the story stretches over the entire lifetime of the characters also constitutes a problem. The different events in the characters' lives we are shown are not very well connected. We are unable to contextualize the events and therefore the characters' motivation is difficult to comprehend. In short, the story is fragmented. As for the ending, well I am not going to spoil the movie for anyone, but I will say that it is a bit far-fetched.",5,3,8,3 March 2005
