The Expendables 2," Excellent When Viewed With the Right Mindset
","10 out of 10, you say? This film?First, we must recognize The Expendables 2 for what it really is: We're not going to see anything new here, there isn't going to be a fantastic plot, and the acting will be corny at times. With that said, the Expendables is not to be judged by its plot or acting. For me the greatness of the film comes from being able to see so many of the great action actors in one ridiculous movie. Seeing so many of your favorite actors in one project is the real reason for seeing this film.Though no great cinematic achievement, The Expendables 2 is a great improvement from the first one. It is much less dark, the humor is better, and the villain is much more interesting. A cast like this will never be found in any other movie series. Just enjoy the explosive 80s- style action.",10,0,0,21 August 2013
