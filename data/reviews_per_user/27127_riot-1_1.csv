The Ring," You people really make me wonder sometimes...
","You people really make me wonder sometimes, this movie is one of the best to come out in years, and there is still a large chunk of you crying and whining about a little plot hole you think you have found, or you did not like how it ended. Why do you even bother watching movies if you hate just about everything you see? Anyway, if you take the time to understand The Ring you will find it rewarding, as there really is not any plot holes at all, and if you think you have found one, it was most likely put there on purpose as a mystery, people like mystery's, why do you think people gossip about The X-files around the watercooler all day? Because if you knew everything about the story it would be dull and there would be nothing left to ponder about all day.",Null,1,1,25 May 2003
