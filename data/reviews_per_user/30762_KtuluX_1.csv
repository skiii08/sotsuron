Requiem for a Dream," Not You're normal Trash Movie
","In this Film, Darren Aronofski obviously takes the time to inspect every aspect of every scene.  The Lighting and sound very well compliments the actors and their character's emotions.  The sound is incredible.  The actors did a wonderful job.  This is hands down my favorite movie since The Godfather.",10,0,1,8 January 2003
