The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project can be summed up in one word - HYPE.
","This movie was said by some critics to be the scariest or possibly best movie of all time, but it  was far from the scariest or best.  Although many people who have seen the movie state that they were completed terrified and still shaken by the movie, I was not even a little frightened.  I am not trying to say that I'm tough I just think that perhaps I missed something that everybody else found scary.  Perhaps I have been sucked in by the blood and gore horror's of the 90's but I just don't understand how people can say that they enjoyed the film.Maybe it was just me but by the end of the movie I was pretty sick and tired of all the screaming and arguing going on, especially from Heather Donahue.  Don't get me wrong I think they did a great job selling the supposed reality of the story I just found it annoying. A lot of common sense was also lacking in the film.  Simple things such as following a stream when you get lost, or to stop filming when you are about to lose your mind.  But perhaps Josh said it best when he said that looking through the camera lens takes away from the reality of the situation, or something like that.  Staying awake through the night would also have been a good idea. I think the movie had the right concept of trying to make it look real I just don't think that they did enough to make it scary.  This perhaps could just be my lack of imagination. This movie could also have been destroyed for me because I went in to it with such high expectations.  I have always enjoyed making movies with my friends and when heard that there was going to be an actual film made with a low budget by two film students I became very interested.  If I had watched this movie, knowing nothing about it before hand perhaps my opinion would be different. The majority of the film is the trio getting ready to embark on their journey and hiking through the woods with no problems.  This took up almost an hour of the eighty-some minute long movie.  I thought that the first hour was humorous and I think that overall the film was funnier than it was scary. I heard that the next movie for the two writters is supposed to be a comedy, maybe it will be scarier than it is funny. I would say to someone that hasn't seen it to go because there are obviously people who find it scary so go and see for yourself.  And hey, if you don't find it scary you'll at lest get a few laughs.But hey, that's just me!",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
