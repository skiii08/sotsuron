But at the end the bear shows up, and hunts the innocent animals up. It ends with a chase along the so colorful and lovely suburb. Stay at the end credits. There could had been green light for more movies if it was a bigger success, but now go to the fan fictions instead. Ben Folds plays the Curious George like playful songs.
