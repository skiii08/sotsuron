Sucker Punch," anime with soul....
","most likely one of the best films i have seen in awhile...which sadly i see critics and movie patrons are giving this a solid C. Not only did this director find the timing to push and pull the movie in a pleasing flow that made every part of the story enjoyable, it also happens to be one of the most beautiful movies, visually, that i have seen in a long time..and if you find yourself not immediately in love with the story then you should watch it again..you may have understood one story but neglected the other 5 going on...the re occurring theme has to do with the layers of sycosis..the flip is which of them were projected from the doctor and which ones are the coping mechanism of the patient. and yes when she is performing or any other girl, yes its sex..they live in hell...they've dolled up the acts of there punishment..but if you didn't understand the movie it is at least the prettiest you've seen in a long time",9,3,10,26 March 2011
