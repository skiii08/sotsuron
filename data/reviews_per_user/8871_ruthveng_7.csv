The Blair Witch Project," Gets right inside your head!
","I have always thought this to be one of the best horror films i have ever watched.First of this style, which spawned many subsequent films. Whilst it will get criticised for being exactly what it was intended to be, a real life documentary pretence.It gets inside your head, as it is meant to. No big budget here, therefore skillful tension build and tapping in to your own fears is what makes blair witch one of the best.I watched this with my 12 year old last night, who loves horrors and like me is critical of poorly executed horror films. She thoroughly enjoyed this 20 years old film.If you have not seen it, watch it and let your mind go!",8,0,2,20 April 2019
World War Z," Zombies in Scotland
","Some parts of this were filmed in Glasgow, strangely they chose George square in the city centre, as they opposed to areas like Arden or Castlemilk where they could have saved some production cash, as they already look like a zombie apocalypse has taken place!The film was decent for a zombie movie, which over the years have generally been more like storyless gorefests.Some nice touches and chaotic scenes make the film watchable.If you are looking for an easy watching film, it will definitely do.",7,0,0,8 March 2019
The Babadook," Disappointing
","I had read a fews ok reviews about this film, butI felt this was totally nonsensical, which I generally dislike in a movie and this was no different.Tries to scare with ridiculous attempts to build tension filled moments, 'baba dook dook dook' WTF?, but failed miserably throughout. There are not many decent horrors that have captured, as they fail miserably at the things i have just described.As a person that would regard horror as one of my favourite genres i am quite critical and give credit where credit is due. This deserves little credit.",4,0,2,8 March 2019
Bird Box," Bullock, must be desperate for work!
","This was poor from start to finish, they could have made a film about the monster under your bed when you were young and it would have had more logic.It is 2 hours of my life i will not get back!",2,3,4,26 January 2019
Get Out," An Odd film to watch
","I quite enjoyed this film, with a racial slant, which was probably unnecessary, however the director is tapping in to the sad divisions in the west at the moment, which no doubt has boosted views and ratings.The film is quite weird throughout, but enjoyable. It has been popping up in top rated horrors, when i am looking for a film to watch, which essentially drew me to the film. It in no way should be brought within a best horror film list, however as i said, the director played to the outrage crowd that will give it high ratings as they pander to the racial divisions of society.The story throughout is intiguing and keeps you watching to the end. If you are not keen on classic films like videodrome, IT, white worms lair you will not enjoy this. I have done the hard work for you here and do not watch, as parts of the film annoy you(not as much as thise films though).If you are a movie fan, you will want to see this, as many will have enjoyed it and I have to say, i did eventually, it was a bit of a struggle at early points. I have to say, the young fella Daniel Kaluuya is brilliant in the role and his friend Lil Rel Howery adds for some decent laughs regarding racial stereotypes.I gave the film 7, therefore, give it a watch, but do not make it a priotity watch.",7,0,3,5 May 2019
Super 8," Decent and watchable
","I thought this would have been better than it actually was due to Spielbergs involvement and a number of good reviews, however i found the film not moving as fast as i thought it would.If you are a fantasy film fan you will enjoy it, but like myself not be enthralled. IF you are not a fantasy film fan, you will probably make it to the end, but may struggle with it throughout.To summarise, watchable and certainly not the worst.",6,0,2,2 April 2019
Green Book," A Must see
","What an absolutely brilliant movie, with every emotion covered.I do not think these roles could have been portrayed better Viggo Mortenson and Mahershala Ali are captivating in the story.Every aspect of the film is like a reversal of the world or how it was. I hope the story was played out exactly as the film narrates it. what a tremendous story.Do not miss this!",9,0,2,23 October 2019
