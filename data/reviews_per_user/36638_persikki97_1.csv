Hereditary," Terrifically Terrifying
","I went in oblivious to the rumours circulating around this movie and I'm happy I did. With a plot that slowly builds up and elements of the uncanny valley leaving you with a continuous feeling of unease, this movie was beyond my expectation. 
If you are tired of jump-scares and obvious plot lines this movie is definitely for you.",10,1,2,27 August 2018
