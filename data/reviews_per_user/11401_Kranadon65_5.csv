Alien 3," Disappointing to say the least
","I vaguely remember when this movie came out in theatres and I had already heard
the general consensus was that i was lousy. It was probably 10 years later before I actually watched it on DVD and I probably watched it 3 or 4 more times over the years. I tired to find some redeeming qualities but cannot. It kind of defeats the whole purpose of Aliens ending , you have Newt ,Hicks , Bishop and Ripley all surviving and then you kill all of them off except Ripley. I cannot imagine that this was the original idea yet i see that Weaver co-produced. I've read some other articles that the plot was rewritten several times from having an adventure with the surviving characters from Aliens to killing all except Ripley.The dark depressing theme with ugly characters and a lot of plot holes just adds to the lousiness. Gritty is one think but it's more of a cop out. If you ask me when and if they finally tie the prequels to the current alien universe they should retcon Alien 3 and Resurrection which were both total garbage. Weaver should not be allowed to have creative control either. It shouldnt become a one woman show , Weaver is a good actress but its time to pass that torch.",1,2,2,7 April 2019
Justice League," DC has a long way to go
","DC so far has lagged way behind Marvel in entertaining movies. Only Christian Bale's Batman has lived up to the hype. I did like Wonder Woman too but it still isn't top notch for all its hype. Justice League is a mess of a movie , it actually had me yawning for most of it. The action is boring and the villain is really a disappointment. Steppenwolf ? wasn't that a rock band in the 70's?. If anything why didn't they have Darkseid? . And of course during the end credits we have Luthor and Deathstroke appearing hinting at the Injustice League. Looking at box office results, the Justice League better pick it up to even break even. 5/10",5,2,4,18 November 2017
A Quiet Place," Suspenseful and entertaining but some plot points lacking
","Enjoyed the movie for the most part and the creepiness and suspense was definitely the highlight. The first half of the movie all in silence adds to the tension, the main protagonist couple loses a small child in the beginning to terrifying unknown creatures because the daughter gives him a toy that the father specifically told him he could not have. That is a necessary plot point albeit ignorance and disrespect of the daughter and the small child knowing the consequences of making noise which is what the toy was designed to do. Fast forward to the family living in silence, the mother is pregnant ,another plot point that comes into play later in the movie, babies make a lot of noise so not smart ,most likely they wanted a child to replace the lost one. The writers added these plot points that make it more tense but in reality why would you want to bring a child into such a terrifying place and one where the baby's normal noises would risk lives . Of course they build a soundproof shelter under the house complete with a small chamber with air to keep the baby's noises hidden . Why didn't they just go in that soundproof area to talk to each other in the first place and not have the tense moments avoiding knocking things over accidentally which does eventually happen. A lot of these plot point made no sense and more than likely added to create more tensions and scary moments. Such as they already know the creatures track by even the slightest sound, so why wouldnt a plot point involve more ways to distract them , since they are sound sensitive I'm sure someone in the billions of people could exploit that weakness with high frequency sound and other ways to incapacitate them. 
It's not really explained where the creatures came from ,we only see glimpses of the newspaper clipping the father has saved about a meteorite landing which brings the assumption they are aliens and that they have virtually indestructible armor plating ,even to nukes? i mean you could dig large deep pits and lure them in with sound devices like the egg timer the wife has or fireworks like the son uses later on and trap them - then try gassing them or something else , they have to breathe so why not . Well, its a movie so certain reasonable plot points make no sense , the ignorance of the children especially the deaf daughter which causes the father to lose his life . That in itself is a rather stupid scene of self sacrifice. And the signal fires they light at night , the creatures relay on sound and are blind but can they smell ? And we only see 1 other human character ,an old man who dies after his wife is killed . Where are the other people lighting the other fires we see early in the film, later in the film the kids light another fire but we do not see the other fires anymore . Does this mean the other people who lit them before are dead? . There are plot holes of course as to why there are no other people seen besides the family and the old man? Did the military get over run by these creatures? If this random deaf girl discovered how to use feedback from her hearing aid to fight the sound sensitive creatures , wouldnt someone far more intelligent like a scientist have found that out ? Such things make the movie less plausible and more on the suspend belief category .Yes it's fictional but sometimes it would be nice if the writers threw in some common sense and not way too many inconsistencies.",7,4,7,9 April 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Beautiful cinematography and some amusing moments.
","I've seen some reviews comparing it to the 1974 version. Having never seen that version as I was much too young when it came out in 1974 was probably a good thing.One thing that was very nice was the beautiful cinematography. I never had an interest in these type movies much but the actors in it drew me in. Kenneth Branaugh is rather amusing with the ridiculous moustache which in itself deserves an Oscar for the makeup artist who created it. His Poirot is amusing and delivers the best lines without missing a trick. Johnny Depp as a sleazy art dealer also has some good scenes. The rest of the cast though is disappointing , although it's not entirely their fault as Branaughs direction suffers from sleepwalking ,as if the actors are phoning it in. Judi Dench and her servant are wasted in their roles, Salma Hayek is just terrible , she does not belong in this movie. Daisy Ridley of the new Star Wars trilogy is also miscast here , while a decent actress, she is just uneven. And Michelle Pfeiffer who physically has not aged well does have a few moments towards the end of the movie but by then it's a bit too late. I kind of figured out who did it halfway through the movie so the ending twist was no surprise at all.",7,0,5,10 November 2017
Warcraft," Really boring and incoherent movie
","I have done a lot of online gaming , warranted WOW wasn't something I ever got into so I thought I'd see this movie to see what the hype was about. I wasn't impressed and started falling asleep half way through. It was a plodding mess with so much CGI and boring battle scenes that I began to wonder why people in China are so into this movie ? I guess there are a lot of hard core WOW fanboys in China. Lucky for the backers of this movie as it is bombing here in the states. Summing up, Warcraft is a really poorly made boring video game movie that is on par with Street Fighter and Super Mario Bros. And no doubt it will get a sequel because of the idiots in China and other countries shelling out the cash for this bomb.",1,23,52,12 June 2016
