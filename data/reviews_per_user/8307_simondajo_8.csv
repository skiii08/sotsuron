Minority Report," The importance of a Science Fiction movie/series lies in the writer.
","Thank the wonderful fertile prophetic mind of P.K.Dick for this film;the success and impact of Science 'Fiction' movies lies in thescript / plot / ideas; forget Cruise, Spielberg, Special Effects etc; itsall in the storyline and how it relates to us today. Go read somereally good Sci Fi novels / short stories for the same effect.",8,0,0,22 January 2003
Memento," A man's 'memento' of his murdered wife is the fact that the sight of her lying dead was his last real memory.
","I have read some critic's remarks about this marvelous film, andmany complain that it is too complicated and incomprehensible;well, it is supposed to be; and there is no need to see it a secondtime if you were confused. The intention of the writer / director wasto show how life for us is simply a combination of short memories, which we can omit, extend, devote our lives to, confuse ourselveswith etc. The film demonstrates wonderfully what chaos happenswhen we lose these short term memories, and combined with thisis a refreshingly fractured plot, which we can make no sense outof, like Leonard himself. We are cleverly and disturbingly placedinto the mind of Leonard and leave the theater wondering andconfused, just like he drives off with absolutely no resolution. Don'twe get tired of films that are resolved in the end?; our own lives aremostly unresolved, and the film magically reflects this feeling. Onecriticism I read was the question of why Leonard didn't use a taperecorder to capture his memories; the answer is simple, and hepoints it out in the film; if he lost it he would lose everything ( mostof his important facts to remember are tattooed on him for thisreason ), and also he realizes the sheer impact of visual memory;his 'records' are either visual or written on himself. Remember heis a very intelligent perceptive guy, which is why he was good at hisjob testing insurance claims; and he also repeatedly reflects theimportance of speaking to someone face to face...here againcomes in the impact of vision ( seeing the eyes and bodylanguage etc  ) ...this may be an indirect criticism of the growingtrend of Internet friendships and dating, where mostly you just seeor hear words. Another criticism raised by the well known criticRoger Ebert is the idea that if seeing his wife was the last thing heremembered, why could he always remember he had short termmemory loss? Well the answer to this is pointed out in the film aswell, and also when you understand short term memory loss thesolution becomes simple ( these talented film makers doresearch, unlike some well known critics ). Leonard points out thathe is different from the poor guy with a similar disorder but who iscompletely incapacitated, and ends up in a nursing home;Leonard would have been told by doctors about his condition, andhe sees it as crucial to remember he has a problem, which is whyhe is constantly repeating it to people and I'm sure in his ownmind; he is fighting it all the time. Also the experts say thecondition comes in different degrees, and that a good method ofrehabilitation is constantly repeating things and thoughts; he canalso remember where he parks his car, leaves his keys; everydaythings. The problems he encounters in the film are not everyday,making his struggle all the more difficult. Therefore anothermessage we may gain is to admit openly that we have a problemand not repress it, such as alcoholism. For me the film isfaultless. It is absolutely confusing and disjointed, evenmeaningless on the surface; well to me thats what life is.",9,0,2,7 January 2003
We Were Soldiers," I hate patriotism, war, violence, and ignorant comments, but I admire courage and leadership, which is what the film portrays.
","Great commanders in history led from the front, and suffered thesame hardships as their soldiers, such as Alexander andCaesar...Moore was such a man. This film is about bravery andleadership in the face of abhorrent violence and fear. Thats it. Wesee it also from both sides, refreshingly, although the Vietnamesecommander was more of a tactician; probably the Vietnamesesaw the value in keeping such adept commanders alive, plus hehad the advantage of sheer numbers. We see the courage andfear also of the families left behind, and are reminded poignantlythat the Vietnamese were human, when we see the photograph ofthe brave bayonet charger's wife, and the respect the Vietnamesecommander showed for the 'enemy' by leaving the small raggedAmerican flag behind. The image of the small dirty ragged flag ona tree stump foretells the doom and humiliation the Americans willeventually suffer, after years of meaningless slaughter. TheAmericans lost the war but killed 40 times men than they lost; thisis a tribute to the bravery and commitment of the Vietnamese. We see Moore standing tall and vulnerable because at that stagehe didn't care whether he lived or died, as he had lost so many ofhis men and felt severe guilt; like Alexander, pure luck kept himalive. After his honest prayer with the young soldier in the chapel,he adds a surprising comment about the Vietnamese having noGod etc; he remembers that he has to remain detached, or hecould never be an effective leader.",8,3,5,15 January 2003
Being John Malkovich," A puppeteer who is constantly misunderstood, finding solace in becoming other people and expressing their feelings, ironically portrayed and extended surreally when he discovers a means of actually BEING som
","The puppeteer is isolated, and tired of his own life, like many of us, and nobody understands him at all; magnified in the filing secretary's constant  and absurd bewilderment at what he is saying. This is not a comedy or a fantasy. It is a drama which gives us insight into something most of us have thought about but found it hard to conceive; the thought of what it is like to be somebody else. Added to this is the puppeteers' skill in learning how to control the character Malkovich, actually becoming himself again but in a different body; all he wants is the name of a star to be able to continue his passion and means of escape. So the means of escape is not being somebody else, its having circumstances to pursue your dreams...we are all hampered in our dreams by achievable things, such as money, or gaining recognition, but we are easily discouraged. So the film is not about being someone else, it is about realizing your potential and achieving recognition.Malkovich comes across as dull and everyday; we see him, through the portal, doing everyday things; such as showering, reading the paper, dating...nothing special. It is only when the puppeteer is in control that we see Malkovich earning recognition...such as the TV report and the standing ovation. To Malkovich acting is just a job; he is nothing like the mysterious, sinister, witty character we often see him playing...when he was asked why he liked acting he gave a very bland, uninspiring reply.The world is full of souls who believe they have no satisfaction in life or creative outlet, unlike the puppeteer, for example those lining up to be somebody else for 15 minutes were looking for brief escape from themselves. Of course we would all like that from time to time, so another theme may be the human condition of being trapped in our own heads; but no magical escape for us. But why would we want to be someone else; even movie stars are basically like us, they simply have work that makes them well known...so the main character's aim is to use this notoriety to his own ends, his OWN. Initially it was a basic animal instinct to have sex with a woman he desired, but he soon realized what this Malkovich face could do for him. So I think the writer is advising us to forget about envying other people, it is not only impossible to be them but even if you were them you would not find fulfillment. Be happy with what God gave you and use what you have to the best of your advantage. The old people regenerating were a symbol of the pathos of wishing to live forever. Seize the day!  Fame is shallow. The real Malkovich was brave enough to demonstrate this fact. He is a good actor, but we are just as good at what we do well, like our friend the puppeteer.",8,1,2,5 January 2003
The Usual Suspects," There are 'invisible' people out there who control the way we live more than we would care to think.
","This is an immaculate movie experience without one low point.The movie is brilliant in many ways: intricate twisting plot, actionpacked, great character development, suspense, sinister mood,black comedy, subtlety, realism and social comment. Well, thereyou have a whole lot of skills to put in one movie, and all theseelements combine wonderfully to create a perfect whole by theend, yet leaving you disturbed. The film will also entertainteenagers, those  seeking escapism,  as well as intellectuals. Thecasting goes a long way to making the film also. Spacey is simplybrilliant, superbly supported by the other main actors. The movieteases and controls us. A major understated theme is that we arebeing controlled to some degree by unseen, unknown people...ina world of computer data and cross matching, we simply have noidea about the extent to which we are known, monitored, evencontrolled; a very scary and relevant issue.",9,0,1,8 January 2003
Mulholland Drive," Very old tired theme, trying to be resurrected using not a fractured plot but a mutilated one.
","Same old theme; small town country girl with high hopes comes toHollywood and ends up in the 'gutter'. Lynch is so overrated; heshould have stuck to popular TV. This movie is so obviouslycontrived and techniques  plagiarised very badly. The whole storyis obvious and predictable from the start and completely unsubtle;all the characters are cliches. There is not one single ounce of witor humour in the film. He needs two very attractive actresses toprop it up. He uses an unsurprising but unnecessary erotic scene.The violence is staged. You could leave about two thirds of the filmon the cutting room floor; it is so laborious. There is no sense ofmood in the film. No sense of LA...it could have been set in theMongolian film capital.Links in the film are either just put in thereor non-existent; if he is trying to portray Hollywood as all of theabove well I guess he succeeded, including its worst director. Isaw this film a couple of hours ago before lunch, and my sandwich was more memorable than the film. The acting was okbut I'm sure the actors were as clueless as the director about whatwas going on; Lynch is a fake. Just compare the film to any CoenBros' film, and I think you will get my point.",3,0,3,19 January 2003
Life Is Beautiful," A Moving Example of True Love In Reality and How Precious Life Is
","Contrary to the comments of many, this is not a Holocaust movie;anyone who wants to sit through 2 hours of unspeakable bestiality,suffering and horror needs therapy. If you want to see the reality ofthe Holocaust, watch actual film footage of naked bodies ofinnocent men, women and children being bulldozed into massgraves, as I have done because I am a historian who wants to seethe truth; or visit a Holocaust museum and speak to a survivor, as Ihave done also. By now we should all know the reality of whathappened, which can never be convincingly depicted by actors orsets in a movie. The survivors I spoke to dwelt on the human spirit,survival, love, and even forgiveness of the Nazis involved. Mostcomment that the movie is split into halves, but its theme is Lovein the fullest meaning of the word, and this gives the film totalcontinuity. More than half of marriages now end in divorce andleave children with one parent, many of the other marriages areunhappy ones, all leaving children scarred, not to mention theprevalence of child abuse. This film is about how love canblossom in good times and bad. The wife didn't run away, shewanted and needed to follow her family, the husband used isinventiveness and humour and most of all his love for his wife andchild to protect the son against all odds, and communicate to hisunseen wife that he and their son were alive; all of this because ofLove, not romance or sentimentality or sensuality as love is toooften portrayed, usually ending in disappointment, separation andanother search for Hollywood love or 'romance'. The movie isintelligent and assumes we know the real Holocaust and neverattempts to be historical, apart from the brief view of a mass gravejust as a quick reminder to us of the true horror, its message islove pure, in its joy as well as longsuffering and pain. Many willattest that life is beautiful even more after brushes with death, andthe film is mainly centred on the son, who for the rest of his dayswill never forget his parents love and attention, and the protectionhis father gave him, allowing him to appreciate that life is trulybeautiful and to pass his experiences onto others and his ownfamily.",Null,1,3,9 January 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Reveals common misconceptions about mental illness, in particular schizophrenia, using a brilliant mathematician as a vehicle.
","This film is not meant to be a biography; if you want an accuratebiography go read a book...you cannot make a film into abiography. The film does not set out to explain modern theories ofeconomics and quantum physics ( again, find an Idiot's Guide! ). Ihave personal experience of mental illness, and the great worth ofthe film is its focus on the nightmarish experience ofschizophrenia, and the general lack of understanding about it,even in the 21st century; it has more impact as well by showinghow such an illness can possibly destroy the mind of a genius.  Ofcourse in addition how it could wreck one's family, relationshipsand career. The film is generally empathetic about how his wifeand close friends stick by him, which is so important, no matterhow scary things can get, and also shows the importance of usingavailable drug therapy. It also demonstrates the ability of thesufferer of this illness to overcome it to the degree of being able tolive a successful life, by acknowledging the illness ( a physicalillness which attacks the brain...I do not like the term mentalillness ), and striving to fight those thoughts and images that youknow are irrational, even though they can be so real. In the film theimaginary characters are more real to the viewers of the film thanthey are to those not close to Nash; thus trying to demonstrate tous the absolute reality of these figures in the mind of the afflictedperson. Throughout his life these 'imaginary' characters werealways real, he just chose not to acknowledge them or speak tothem; he had the advantage of being supremely intelligent andunderstanding his disease; and in his final speech he acknowledges mathematics, quantum theory, and his own imagination as part of his make up; he embraces them; they arepart of who is John Nash, thus raising the ever stimulatingquestion of what reality actually is.",8,0,1,13 January 2003
