The Avengers," Come on..this is a bad movie!
","I don't see why everybody has liked this movie so much.I did not like this movie.I think its a amateurish take on teaming up the super-heroes to entertain the audience. Most of the jokes and one-liners are outdated and you hardly feel like laughing at them. (Except for few from the man, the Iron Man ;) ) The silly quarrels the team gets into turns you off. The concept of getting our bad guy from out of space, the powers of whose almost are like supernatural, is totally unimpressive.All in all, I would say only kids may enjoy this movie.I am a big fan of Marvel comics and I thoroughly enjoyed the Spidermans, the Iron mans etc... But this one, except for some action at the end, is a waste of time and money",5,10,32,2 May 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Cant believe someone could even like this movie!!
","No offense meant, but this is probably the worst movie I 've ever seen in my life..may be because I had expectations about this movie after going through the IMDb reviews....but OMG, this movie turned out to be the most overrated movie on IMDb..sorry guys..it has a craziest storyline you can think off, from the way the movie starts and moves, you would get an impression this will turn out to be just another Friday 13th kinda movie, but then the absurdity starts, and you will be like- 'can somebody even ,think like that??'.. there's lot of blood n killings, less thrilling..no comedy no fun.. huh..well, all in all I dint like this movie, not even a bit..",4,12,22,15 August 2012
