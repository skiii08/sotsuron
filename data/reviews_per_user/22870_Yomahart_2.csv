The Expendables 2," Immortals 2 (also known as Expendables 2)
","A new brand of superheroes. Fantastic never seen before abilities. You can peek into the lives of the demigods. They walk among us. Brief list of their abilities: - BAAAH (Bullet Absorbing Aura Around Hero): With this skill the heroes do not need a bullet proof vest, the bullets fired towards them simply vanish in this magic field. Wearing a vest will sometimes negate the effect of the aura but the hero can only be shot in the vest and the bullet will never penetrate. - TMC (Total Mind Control): Protagonists can control the mind of every villain therefore they will do illogical and stupid things. This is a passive ability. - OTLFD (Only The Least Famous Dies): If everything fails and the heroes are in the hands of the superbadguy they use this ability. Then the homicidal maniac will only kill the least famous guy in the group, then he will let everyone go. - CCN (Call Chuck Norris): Heroes in the face of danger can summon a powerful spirit to fight for them, only works if they are out of ammunition.This mythological tale will give you 103 minutes of pure fun! I hope there will be a new movie every year ... straight to DVD!",3,3,5,2 October 2012

The only difference between this and a bad action movie is that Chuck Norris is now a wizard and called Gandalf.<ul><li>What's the plan Gandalf? - We walk, fight, walk, run, fight, walk, run - if there's a problem then magic. - What if the magic won't work? - Miracles my friend, miracles.</li></ul>If you liked the LOTR trilogy, avoid this, if you care about common sense, avoid this.",3,8,15,4 January 2013
