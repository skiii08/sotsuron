Your Name.," Outstanding
",Not often I feel the sensation of the unknown. That's what i like to call it at least. Whenever i think or see something supernatural to the extent it scares me. I felt this feeling through a lot of this film. Beautiful. Magical. Mesmerising. The greatest animation of all time.,8,4,5,7 July 2018
Deadpool 2," Funny but not as good as the first
","The curse of the sequel.Deadpool tried to be bigger, louder and darker. And although it was all of those things, it sacrificed a truly funny plot and replaced it with a more serious one.Although it is still a laugh out loud movie it feels like too much at points and often the jokes fall flat due to the over complex plot and dialogue",6,27,92,15 May 2018
Ready Player One," stupid
",Its just a silly kids film. Don't bother watching.Offically taken steven spielburg off of my list of favourite directors,3,0,2,13 April 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," INTENSE
",This movie tells the a simple and dark story of an unfortunate event. However unlike most movies this movie taken on the perspective from all the characters and instead of forcing on a side it leads us to empathise with no one.This is a great achievement in cinema and has a strong message attached but this message was not clear cut enough as it could be.Outstanding performances and brilliantly directed.,6,2,4,4 February 2018
City of God," Unmissable
","What amazes me about this film is the structure and directing which elevates an already outstanding true story to one of the greatest pieces of film making out there. Elements of this film remind me of American history X with the cycle of hate concept which shows how killing leads to more killing. This however is a step up from American history X as the use of children to depict this concept makes the film much more emotional.Deservedly given an incredible 8.6 on imdb, City of God is a film and place the whole world should know of.",9,0,0,2 January 2018
Get Out," A modern classic
","Jordan Peele's debut has changed the game. A sharp, visceral and at some points comedic look at 'modern racism' in america is just what cinema needed.Social thrillers now have standards set far higher than any predecessor due to outstanding performances by Daniel kaluuya and Allison williams and a captivating story line with a perfect plot twist.What prevents this thriller from reaching the heights of nolans is the unfortunate unrealistic concept of brain transfers which frustratingly holds back this film from becoming a masterpiece.Despite that the symbols and motifs lift this film well beyond classic thrillers and has engraved itself in the history of cinema",8,19,38,23 January 2018
Silence," great if you enjoy shit films
",I reckon the real toruture would have been if the japanese forced the christians to sit through this film.,3,21,39,10 January 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," Yeah....
",So I love movies which leave the audience with questions. But this movie took it so far to the extent that all the positive reviews are forced to talk about how strange and boring it is.Theres a limit....,6,1,6,23 March 2018
Avatar," Without a doubt the greatest movie ever made.
","Before I am completely discredited for a conterversial headline, the reader should know that I owe a lot of my love for film to Avatar. I saw Avatar when i was 10 and at the time it was by far the best and more creative thing I had ever witnessed. Now, having just turned 18, and having rated over 500 films on imdb (including 100 from the top 250) it still remains the best movie I have ever seen. My reason for this is simple. Avatar has everything I could possibly want from a film. An engaging underdog plot which resonates with me on a spiritual level, ground breaking visuals, a romantic sub plot and action which is guaranteed to get anyones heart pumping. Given Avatar is the most successful film of all time its not surprising it has encountered some fierce hate. Whether its because of its political undertones or its environmental message, thousands of users have rated Avatar 0/10 on imdb. More reasonable criticism of Avatar is related to its 'predictable' and 'lazy' plot. Having seen many films I can safely say I have never seen anything close to Avatar. If anyone has please tell me- I'm sure I'll love it!Glad I got that out of my system.",10,1,1,28 December 2017
The Shape of Water," What a stupid waste of time.
","Honestly, I dont even remotely see the appeal of this mess.Awful script and awful directing.Michael shannon and sally hawkins delivered good performances but other than that the plot was pathetic.I can't even fathom why this is being critically acclaimed. The academy is truly stupid. This is worse than spotlight. Which means it might actually win...",3,10,30,23 February 2018
American Made," Another brilliant Anti-hero movie
","From the wolf of wall street to Bronson, anti heroes rule cinema and american made is a fine example of why.Mixing humour, brilliant directing and edge of your seat moments, american made is a very entertaining movie. Despite being lengthy and never reaching the heights of other great anti hero films it 
will go down as one of the best movies of 2017.Would recommend to anyone",7,0,1,4 February 2018
Steve Jobs," Snappy Dialogue, brilliant directing and an outstanding performance
","Although many viewers will have hoped for a success story of how Steve Jobs created Apple in his garage, they are instead confronted with a darker look into the life of Steve Jobs and the obstacles he faced. This movie may not be as slick and cool as the social network, however it still remains an excellent biopic. The key reason why this film wasn't a box office success lies in mixed critic reception. A film of this genre has to gain impeccable reviews to fill cinema seats. However I believe this film was snubbed and deserved both acclaim and box office success. This is not one to be missed.",7,0,0,30 December 2017
Wonder Woman," David thewlis VS gal gadot...... who cares
",Come on DC... This one started so well but you still managed to BOTCH it with that stupid ending which only was one of the most unrealistic concepts ever made but also boring and weird.its a shame cos Wonder woman has cool guitar rifts and a lot of potential. Its just that you guys suck so much. Even your best films are poor.,5,0,5,11 March 2018
Black Panther," WAKANDA FOREVER (Marvel have done it again- awesome movie)
","Once again, Marvel have created a brilliant and epic standalone movie which should please audiences globally. Similar to Thor and Civil War there are elements of humour but also a serious and engaging plot. There are also brilliant action scenes thanks to great directing and casting.The movie also has a strong message which is that diversity and cultural acceptance is essential for economic and technological development.Not one to be missed. WAKANDA FOREVER.",7,44,152,13 February 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," WITH A PENCIL...
","Theres an undeniable charm with John Wick. It could be the slick action, dialogue surrounding the character or the futuristic world in which it is set. And so, despite being disappointed with the first movie I couldn't resist watching the 2nd. Fortunately the 2nd movie delivers on the action with a semi interesting plot which makes the viewing overall enjoyable.
Despite this there are some lazy action scenes and strange elements to the plot. However I'm game for more John Wick. Awesome action. It also made me appreciate why shaky cam exists",6,0,1,5 March 2018
