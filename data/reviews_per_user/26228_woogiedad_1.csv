Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Creative and unique, an excellent follow up to V. 1
","For all of the complaints about pacing in Vol. 2, with the meandering and dialogue-heavy scenes, what I think people are missing is what Q.T. said early in production of the original full-length Kill Bill. He made the point that this was going to be a 'chop-suey' Hong Kong-style film AND a spaghetti western. Anyone who grew up with the spaghetti westerns knows that dialogue advances the plot as much or more than the action. The old westerns spent two-thirds or more of the movies leading up to the 'final showdown.' That there is the whole set-up with Bud and Elle Driver says that Q.T. was winding down intentionally.Anyone who has watched this director's work knows that he does nothing accidental as far as style goes. The music in this movie is an auditory demonstration of what the expected action is to be.My only real complaint, and it may just be me, is that I expected a little more from the confrontation between Elle and The Bride. But at the same time, some of the rumors about the coming comic series give hope that The Bride (Beatrix) and Elle Driver will meet again, though it would not be much of a fair fight (not going to spoil it for anyone).",Null,0,1,30 May 2004
