Blade Runner 2049," Slow burn that melts into your heart and remains forever
","Watch this movie if you like art , you like a good story , u like mystery, u like set piece scenes that's artistically beautiful with special effect and backdrop color that looks spectacular . Mostly watch it just for Ryan gosling . He looks like the best choice for the android role and he nails it I often got the drive movie feel to his character at times which is a good thing . This is plainly said a hate it or love it movie . And I fall in the latter side . I hope u will too",8,1,10,18 February 2019

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not Tarantino's best work ! But still a really good movie ..
","First off this movie won't be made if DiCaprio and Pitt wouldn't have commited to play in it . That being said if you want to see amazing acting display , amazing script , amazing dialogues then go for it . This movie is a must in 2019 cause after watching all the super hero movies and cgi stuff this movie brings the audience back to earth and shows us the true talent of the best actors in the business right now Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. I have to say both of them were amazing but for me Brad Pitt was really fun to watch especially his action scenes .",8,5,9,1 August 2019
Parasite," Watch this movie end this year 2019 with a bang!!
","Where must I start .. is it a drama ? Horror ? Thriller ? Well let's say it's everything and it is true . The director Mr Bong join-ho has given is everything his direction with spectacular visuals makes it looks artistic, the lightings for each shot and frame is phenomenal also the pace of the movie and how the movie gets into next gear and the twist it's all brilliantly done .. This movie is a satire and the line that society has drawn between rich and poor is well narrated through eyes of both the group .. movie is very metaphorical in different acts and it also adds humor excellently ..",9,4,11,9 November 2019
