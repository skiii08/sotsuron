Requiem for a Dream," One of the most nihilistic things I've ever seen.
","This movie was written and directed by people who think human life is worthless.  Some good acting and some interesting but wholly derivative camera work save it from total oblivion.  But people, please, the social fabric isn't this threadbare anywhere in the country where it is set, and nowhere on earth would you find four characters this stupid in the same place and time.  The film makers hammer home a point rather than tell a story, and that point is tiresome, the story unrealistic, and the whole thing an ideological mistake.  I'd call it pretentious, but it's too awful. The director's 'Pi' was a compelling case study on mental illness.  This film is a disappointment.",2,16,30,11 February 2002
