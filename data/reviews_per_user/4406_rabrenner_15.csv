The Incredible Hulk," Green Cheese
","The first Hulk movie was a major disappointment. Ang Lee is a great director, but he fundamentally misunderstood the character. The Hulk is not about Bruce Banner's unresolved Freudian conflicts with his father. Nor is it about fighting giant, gamma-irradiated French poodles.Now along comes Hulk 2.0. Director Louis Leterrier and writer Zak Penn don't have Lee's talent or budget, but have created a more enjoyable, albeit cheesier, movie by sticking closer to the source material. Watch for cameos by Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno, Bill Bixby, and Robert Downey Jr. in his Tony Stark role.The first half of the movie works best: after an efficient opening sequence that gets the origin out of the way, we switch to Bruce Banner as a super powered fugitive, on the run from the US Army, and hiding out in São Paulo. (A nod to the first movie, which ended with Banner hiding in Latin America.) Ed Norton looks sufficiently haunted and emaciated to make this work. The Hulk is wisely kept in shadow and only shown in bits and pieces.The second half of the movie starts showing some cracks. The Hulk doesn't look like Shrek this time, but he still doesn't look believable. Maybe it's impossible for CGI to render a nine foot tall, two ton green giant convincingly. Worse, the personal conflictsBanner with Betty Ross; Betty with her father, General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross; the General with Bannerfeel perfunctory, as if Leterrier and Penn are just filling time until the final throwdown with the Abomination. Here, they could have learned a thing or two from Lee, who excels at personal conflict.",7,3,5,22 June 2008
Sucker Punch," Visually Stunning, Morally Questionable
","Five hot chicks in skimpy costumes battle video game monsters: giant samurai, zombie Hun, Lord of the Ring-ish orcs, Terminator-y robots, fire- breathing dragons, etc. In between there's some MacGuffin about a mental institution that's really a front for a strip club that's really a front for a bordello, but that's just filler until the next (admittedly, visually impressive) fight scene. Writer/director Zack Snyder was reportedly in an extended battle of his own with the MPAA over the rating, but what's left is an incoherent mess. (Watch for the 'extended unrated director's cut' on DVD in a couple of months.) Snyder may have wanted to make The Black Swan, but what he's delivered is closer to Mortal Kombat. And although the movie goes out of its way to establish that the female lead is an adult, the sight of young women/girls being punched, stabbed, shot, ogled, fondled, and sexually assaulted will leave some in the audience feeling queasy.",5,1,4,23 April 2011
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Cut!
","Poor Wolverine! You would think a mutant with razor sharp, unbreakable Adamantium claws would have a better edited, more tightly scripted screenplay for his movie, but I'm afraid not. X-Men Origins: Wolverine starts all the way back when Wolverine and Sabretooth are wee lads and follows them through the Civil War, World Wars I and II, Vietnam (what, no Korean War?), and some post-Nam black ops in Africa before Wolvie finally bonds with his Adamantium and breaks free. This is the critical point in the plot and should have been the opening scene; everything else could have been told in flashback or—better yet—excised.X-MO: W is also loaded down with second-string mutants—Gambit, Blob, Wraith, Deadpool, Agent Zero, Bolt, Silverfox—that seem to have been thrown in strictly for their action figure merchandizing possibilities. Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber do their best to try and hold this mess together, but mostly they are reduced to spouting Cain and Abel platitudes and growling at each other. In the end we see a group of young mutants, including Cyclops and Emma Frost, being herded away by Professor X—an obvious tie-in to the Young Mutants TV show Fox is said to be preparing. There is a final after-the-credits scene of Wolverine drinking sake in a bar in Japan, an apparent setup for a sequel, but given the poor box office for this incoherency, that seems unlikely. I had hoped after the disappointing X-M 3: Last Stand, Fox would try to redeem this franchise, but no dice.",3,2,6,7 June 2009
Spider-Man 3," Ambition Exceeds Grasp
","Spiderman 3 is a much more ambitious film than its two predecessors. It features three villains/plot threads: the Peter Parker/Spiderman-Harry Osborn/Goblin-Mary Jane Watson love triangle thread, the Flint Marko/Sandman-Uncle Ben's murder revenge thread, and the Eddie Brock/Venom rivalry thread.Unfortunately, Sam Raimi and co. can't keep all of this going. The movie starts off promisingly enough with the inevitable Spiderman-Goblin showdown. But then it bogs down in the middle and never quite gains momentum again.Tobey Maguire, so good at playing a nerd with hidden hero potential, is unconvincing as a bad guy. And when did Mary Jane Watson become so whiny? There are references to everything from The Blob to The Nutty Professor to Charlotte's Web to Saturday Night Fever, but none of this coalesces. The big Spiderman-Goblin vs. Venom-Sandman climax feels more like a professional wrestling tag team match than a real emotional payoff.I've read that Sam Raimi didn't want to do the Eddie Brock/Venom plot thread, that it was forced upon him by the producers. If true, that's unfortunate; one less plot thread might have given him room to more fully develop the other two. Let's hope Spiderman 4 is better.",7,0,0,1 July 2007
Cloverfield," GODZILLA For Twenty-Somethings
","A giant monster attacks New York City: the idea is at least as old as THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1953). What distinguishes CLOVERFIELD is its perspective. Stealing THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT's gimmick, it tells the story exclusively from the point of view of five twenty-somethings armed only with a video camera. Instead of the usual panning shots of thousands of anonymous screaming extras fleeing in panic, which has the effect of distancing the audience from the action, we are right down there in the carnage, underfoot as it were, in danger of getting trampled like the rest.Unfortunately, this verisimilitude has landed CLOVERFIELD in political hot water. Some people claim it offensively exploits the memory of 9/11 (like a certain former mayor of New York/ex-Presidential candidate). Just to put things in historical perspective, GODZILLA was made in 1954, just nine years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. (In an early scene, CLOVERFIELD acknowledges its kaiju roots when it is revealed one of the characters is moving to Tokyo to pursue a career.) CLOVERFIELD isn't a classic like GODZILLA, or even as good as THE HOST, another recent giant monster movie that focuses on people. The characters--the heroic guy, the heroic girl, the nerdy guy, the stuck-up girl, the heroic guy's heroic brother--are far too generic to be memorable. On the other hand, it towers over the disappointing 1998 remake of GODZILLA, also set in New York City. CLOVERFIELD is efficient scary entertainment that will hold your attention for its scant 84-minute running time.",7,1,3,6 February 2008
Wanted," If Luke Skywalker Was A Coldblooded Assassin Instead Of A Jedi Knight
","Within every nerd lurks a super-powered killing machine: that's the message of WANTED, the latest movie-cum-video game from Hollywood. Oh, and did I mention Angelina Jolie, she of the pneumatic lips, digs nerds who are super-powered killing machines? With NIGHT WATCH and DAY WATCH, Timur Bekmambetov proved he could direct stylish but incoherent Russian fantasies; with WANTED, he demonstrates he can do the same thing for Tinseltown shoot 'em ups. There are some amusing scenes with bullets whizzing in, around, and through things, but after a while, it all starts to look the same. Morgan Freeman and Terence Stamp, A-list actors, are also in this B-picture, looking slightly embarrassed. With more than a few plot points borrowed from the STAR WARS series ('Luke, I am your father!' 'The Force is strong in this one!'). For those who care, we briefly get to see Jolie's perfect posterior; it almost redeems this otherwise saggy mess.",6,6,15,11 July 2008
No Country for Old Men," No Country For Satisfying Resolution
","The first three quarters of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN are great. It contains all the elements we have come to expect from Coen brothers movies: quirky characters, colorful dialogue, grotesque/comical violence, sharp editing, etc. Javier Bardem turns in an instant classic performance as psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh. (He reminded me a little bit of Alan Arkin's character in WAIT UNTIL DARK. Coincidence?) But then it goes off the rails. After steadily building up to a final violent showdown between good guy Josh Brolin and bad guy Bardem, the Coen brothers perversely refuse to, ahem, pull the trigger: Brolin is killed off screen (!), and world-weary sheriff Tommy Lee Jones always just misses Bardem. Bardem is badly injured in a random car accidentis God punishing him? and if so, for whathaving a bad haircut?but limps away to kill again another day. I'm sure this is suppose to say something deep about the senselessness of violence, and our complicity as voyeurs, but it does not, alas, make for a satisfying ending.",7,1,5,15 December 2007
I Am Legend," Good, But CHILDREN OF MEN Was Better
","Third and best adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic science fiction novel. Special kudos to Will Smith, who manages to hold the screen with nothing more to interact with than a German Shepherd. Unfortunately, the ending is marred by pseudo-philosophical babble about God and Bob Marley (!), not to mention a lengthy plug for SHREK. (Do Will Smith and Eddie Murphy run in the same posse?) They should have stuck with the original ending from the novel: the vampires form their own society, and Will Smith's character realizes that now HE is the monster (hence the title). Last year's under-appreciated CHILDREN OF MEN did a much better job of balancing hope and despair, without tipping over into sentimentality.",7,0,1,29 December 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Succeeds On Its Own Terms
","Fantastic Four 2 is a much less ambitious film then Spiderman 3, but it succeeds better on its own, limited terms. Yes, the characters are two dimensional, the actors wooden, the jokes corny, the special effects mediocre. But Tim Story and co. manage to keep it moving/entertaining for 89 scant minutes. The only real disappointment is Galactus. In the comics, the big G is a God-like being beyond simple human concepts of good and evil; in the movie, he's (literally) a bag of gas.The most interesting aspect of the movie, from a cultural perspective, is the Abu Ghraib prison scandal reference. The Silver Surfer, having been captured by the FF, is 'interrogated' (tortured) by the U.S. army! He isn't waterboarded or led around on a leash, but he is shackled to a table, injected with an unspecified drug, and given electrical shocks with a defibrillator. The FF are so incensed by his treatment that they bust him out of stir. It's a jarring contemporary intrusion into otherwise mindless escapist fare.",7,1,3,3 July 2007
Transformers," Toys Run Amok
","You know you're in trouble as soon as you see Hasbro's name in the opening credits. Good and bad giant alien robots battle for something called 'the Shard of Life,' which resembles Rubik's Cube. When they're not fighting each other, they transform into trucks, cars, and other terrestrial vehicles, which is interesting the first half dozen times it happens.There are also some humans in the movie--a skinny white nerd, a hot brunette mechanic, a fat black nerd, a hot blond nerd, a gung-ho white soldier, a gung-ho black soldier--but they're as interchangeable as the robots. In the end, the skinny white nerd saves the planet and gets the hot brunette mechanic; it's unclear if the fat black nerd gets the hot blond nerd, but he deserves it as compensation for all the fat/racist jokes he's the butt of. The gung-ho white soldier goes home to his pretty wife and pretty baby. I lost track of the gung-ho black soldier, but he probably dies heroically saving the gung-ho white soldier's lifeit's that kind of movie.This is the second movie I've seen in as many weeks where hacking the DoD's network is a plot point (the other is Live Free or Die Hard); certain screenwriters must go to the same Hollywood cocktail parties. Speaking of the DoD, the U.S. armed forces, all the way up to the Secretary of Defense (!), are depicted as superbly trained and extremely well equipped, although their clownish Commander in Chief only displays interest in Hostess Dingdongs. Not coincidentally, the movie was preceded by commercials for the Marines and Air Force.There are certain films that revel in their own stupidity. This is the dumbest flick I've seen since 300. Judging by the applause at the end, there were a lot of like-minded individuals in the audience. I take back all the carping I did about Spiderman 3; at least Sam Raimi and co. tried to make a film with some depth. Transformers makes it seem like The Seventh Seal.",2,4,10,14 July 2007
Grindhouse," The Good (Bad) Ol' Days
","Grindhouse is Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's loving tribute to 42nd Street, back when it was known as The Deuce, before Rudy Giuliani and Walt Disney ruined everything. Grindhouse is two films in one: Planet Terror, a zombie spoof; and Death Proof, a more serious stalker/car chase flick. Both films are artificially stressed to make them look aged, with scratch marks and missing reels (the sex scenes, natch). In between are fake trailers for other psychotronic fare, and commercials for disgusting concession stand food. You can almost smell the weed in the air, and feel the chewing gum underfoot.Unfortunately, audiences didn't get the joke, and the picture bombed. To recoup their losses, the studio is re-releasing Planet Terror and Death Proof as two separate movies, in extended director's cuts. Of the two, Death Proof can best stand alone as its own movie; Planet Terror is too much part of the gag to work by itself. Tarantino seems to be realizing a lifelong dream to become the world's greatest B-movie auteur. There are worse ambitions.",7,0,0,25 September 2007
Super 8," E.T.'s Big Brother Drops In For A Bite
","A group of kids are making a zombie monster movie. They get more than they bargained for when a REAL monster shows up in their small town, courtesy of the U.S.A.F. and a spectacular train wreck.Set in the 1970s, SUPER 8 is filled with references to disco, new wave— Blondie's 'Rapture,' the Knack's 'My Sharona'—and CB radios. It's also filled with references to Steven Spielberg movies from the era—E.T.: THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, JAWS, even THE GOONIES—not surprising, given the producer. Unfortunately, writer/director Abrams can't escape Spielberg's penchant for sentimentality. There are not one but two single, dysfunctional fathers raising alienated, resentful children. Needless to say, they will all learn valuable life lessons by the time the movie's over. Those expecting another CLOVERFIELD will be disappointed. The best part of SUPER 8 is THE CASE—the kid's zombie monster movie-within-a-movie— which screens during the closing credits.",7,1,4,11 June 2011
X-Men: First Class," Mutant And Proud
","Evil mutant Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) plots to start World War III. He is ably assisted by bad girl mutant Emma Frost (January Jones). He is resisted by good mutant Charles Xavier (James McAvoy)—the future Professor X—and ambivalent mutant Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender)— the future Magneto.This prequel to the X-Men franchise has a groovy, Sixties James Bond/Mad Men feel. There are go-go dancers, miniskirts, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. JFK, Khrushchev, and SPOILER ALERT a certain adamantium-clawed mutant all make cameo appearances. But at the center is fan favorite Mystique's (Jennifer Lawrence) contemporary struggle to accept her mutant identity. You can almost hear Lady Gaga singing 'Born This Way' on the soundtrack. Director Matthew Vaughn does a good job keeping the action moving, but with all this plot—not to mention six different writers—some of the character development gets lost. We barely get to know one mutant before he's killed off. Still, overall, this is a successful reboot, and the fanboy in me is looking forward to a sequel. Sentinels, anyone?",7,0,2,4 June 2011
Iron Man," What Happened To The Mandarin?
","Every super hero needs an arch nemesis. Spiderman has the Green Goblin, Batman has the Joker, Superman has Lex Luthor. As any longtime time reader of the comics knows, Iron Man's arch nemesis is the Mandarin. So why is Obadiah Stane, a relatively minor villain, the bad guy in the movie adaptation? I suspect political correctness. The Mandarin is an old school 'yellow peril' inscrutable oriental super villain modeled on Fu Manchu. You could still get away with stereotypes like this in the early sixties when Stan Lee and co. dreamed up the Mandarin, but now the character comes off as distinctly racist.Which is too bad. The Mandarin could be easily revamped for the current generation. After all, Tony Stark, Iron Man's alter ego, started as a shameless member of the military-industrial complex, doing his part to win the Cold War for Uncle Sammy. It wasn't until the seventies that he experienced self-doubt, redirected Stark Industries into humanitarian activities, and became a born-again peacenik. There's no reason the Mandarin couldn't be similarly redesigned to embody, say, the challenge of modern, industrialized China to the United States' global hegemony. Maybe in IRON MAN 2.",7,1,2,26 May 2008
Beowulf," Demonic MILF
","If you like faithful adaptations of literary classics, then you'll hate this movie. If, on the other hand, you like mindless violence, eye-popping 3D special effects, and Angelina Jolie (herself something of a 3D special effect), then you'll enjoy this movie. Zemeckis and co. have sexed up Beowulf, freely inventing infidelity and paternity issues that wouldn't look out of place on an Oprah episode. (Don't tell me you never wondered who Grendel's FATHER was.) There is some philosophical mumbo-jumbo about the coming of Christianity bringing an end to the age of heroes and monsters, but this is just undergraduate b.s. to fill screen time until the next fight scene breaks out. Not quite as ludicrous as 300, but not from want of trying. The mocap animation makes it look like the world's most expensive video game. Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich are also in this big budget B-movie, looking rather sheepish; this may be the greatest waste of acting talent since CLASH OF THE TITANS.",6,1,3,12 December 2007
