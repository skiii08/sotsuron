Iron Man 3," Good But a Few Disappointments
","Considering I have not seen the first two films, I did enjoy watching this one, even if the story was not clear to me. It might only be because there is quite a lot of humour within it but it was still good. The film is basically Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) on his mission to stop the Mandarin. The genres of this film our; action, adventure and Sci-Fi, but mainly action. The budget was estimated to be about $200,000,000 ; which is the same as the first two, and made over $1 Billion so it was clearly more successful than them.I was a bit disappointed that the face of the Mandarin wasn't who he said he was, he turned out to be someone completely different and just a decoy. Although this is disappointing, his character added even more humour to the film. The actual Mandarin was someone completely different to who we thought it was and was a big plot twist, which some of the audience wasn't happy about.I am also disappointed that Stark wasn't in his suit for most of the film which is completely opposite to the title and defeats the point. There were many things that needed to be in the film more. For example Pepper Potts, who showed up at the last minute to save the day and represents girl power to the female audience and the small boy, which clearly shows the Disney influence. Overall, I enjoyed this film and would have probably enjoyed it a lot more if I had watched the first two.",6,0,1,2 October 2013
