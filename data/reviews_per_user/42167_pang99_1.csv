Come and See," Strongest movie ever on the sickness of war
","Idi i smotri, or Come and See, is the movie that has left the strongest impact on me on the awfullness and sickness of the nature of war and what it does to humans. The scenes are so powerfully made and the acting so real that you feel this must be the true hell of war. No other movie on the subject has struck me so hard as this one. I really hope it will be available on DVD all region, so more people can see this truly masterpiece.",10,6,8,18 February 2001
