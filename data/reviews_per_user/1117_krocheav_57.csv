First Man," First Man - Why The Shakes?
","I expected First Man to be first class - yes, it was interesting and often involving but with so many cheap hand held shots all being filmed with close-up lenses or a zoom set in full-tight frame it became a nauseous experience. Big images shaking all over the screen for such a long running time hardly helped endear this epic to the viewer - pity those who may have seen it in IMAX or 3D!. Some scenes tended to be stretched till interest became strained, with much of the emotion being lost before the next sequence began. Were the NASA Toilets truly as dirty as these were portrayed - adding health risks for these important men? (talk about space program budget restraints!) It was interesting to learn a little more about the personal lives but these scenes too, were a little heavy-handed at times. On the plus side, some performances were credible and when the camera was put on a tripod we got some nice looking vistas. The Award winning music score helped add some emotional high spots without being overbearing. Good to be able to actually read the end credit crawl with descent sized lettering for a change - this time, that portion of the budget was well spent.",7,0,0,28 May 2019
Black Swan," Swan Or Ugly Duckling?
","What were they thinking, if thinking at all?. Once you get past all the promo type reviews and the thoughts of the schlock horror fanatics - you begin to find just how disappointed so many of those who rushed off to buy a ticket truly were. Yet another multi award work flickers out across the screen into oblivion. How long will it take the public to realize the academy may consist of many out-of-touch folk with one goal - to promote the industry and ticket purchases by any means.This is the second film I've seen from director Darren Aronofsky, I won't be in any rush to see another. The first, 'NOAH' was equally as appalling as this mess. 'Swan' is based on a perverse script by Andres Heinz (and others) who succeed in revolting the viewer with all manner of uninspiring, low grade ideas. No-one comes out of this cesspool without being drenched in these film makers sordid sludge. Exquisite Natalie Portman is reduced to mere cheap porn - while the writers and director get off on all sorts of unnecessary gratuitous personal sex details (one reviewer aptly called it 'Misery Porn'). Portman is one of those rare talents who truly deserves a class role to introduce her as a dramatic performer - sadly, she does't get that here. This sleazy film is so off the mark in all departments that Huffington Post labeled it: 'Simply Higher Priced Cheese' (they were being kind) while the Hollywood reporter rightly called it: 'Rabit Hole Preposterousness'. As cliché ridden art fraud Psychobabble it should have rightly been shunned by an industry wanting to preserve any worth it might still possess. Certain elements of the ticket buying public may have been reduced to mulch, but certainly not all - watch the popularity meter plummet...Undiscerning viewers may not understand too many of the above comments but, if you care about what you let mess up your head - then stay away for your health's sake.Note: And to think this director was once quoted as uttering...'Finally we can stop thinking about the culture of superficiality'. Well then Mr Aronofsky, please tell us when this might begin to happen? or at least, what happened on the way!",Null,3,4,13 July 2016
The Monuments Men," The Monuments Men - Receive a Rather Smal Monument
","I'm sure Mr Clooney had some good intentions for making this work but did he really have to set his hand to writing and directing? These tasks he has done rather poorly and drags much of his good intentions down to the level of a typical Dirty Dozen meets Oceans 11 type - this story needed more respect. It's also getting to be overly obvious that George 'casts' his cigarettes as closely as his co stars - everything he does features smoking as a major influence to the story (looks ominously like payola unfortunately?) His big cast are also pretty much your Hollywood HBO TV variety and their characters are underdeveloped to the point of creating little empathy. Pity, as the initial-based-on-fact story is worth a far stronger treatment. A good documentary could have covered this more convincingly. I'd recommend taking another look at Frankenheimer's 'The Train' to get a better understanding of the significance of this whole Nazi 'Art theft' business. George was fortunate to get his big budget back but, I suspect many might have been somewhat disappointed with the end product considering such a costly input.",4,2,4,3 May 2018
The Finest Hours," The Finest Hours Lifts You Up Honourably
","This is somewhat of a modern milestone for a Hollywood-style movie. A gut-wrenching story based on a daring, factually based, historic sea rescue. The screenplay, written by Award nominated Scot Silver along with Eric Johnson & Paul Tamasy proves a strong point - that a powerful story can be told without resorting to the now 'trendy' course language - making it an all age spectacular. And, spectacular it is indeed. Based on Michael J.Tougias and co-author Casey Sherman's book of the same name, this exciting story literally dumps the viewer into a tiny Coast Guard rescue boat as it's being pounded by the most deadly seas of all.Even though the CGI folk have overdone certain effects - some of the angry ocean scenes are often so convincing they leave you wanting to grab a towel to dry off or even check your life jacket is handy! A strong hand picked stellar cast convince all the way, while Chris Pine and Casey Affleck put in hard working performances as the heroic Coast Guard pilot and the engineer of a stricken cargo giant - that's been torn in two by massive winds and seas. Cynical viewers who have been seduced by hard-edged 'modern' scripts - need to be reminded that love in the 1950's moved at a slower, more thoughtful pace than the soulless in-your-face situations we see in movies today.Photographically, The Finest Hours features stylish visuals by Spanish born D.O.P. Javier Aguirresarobe and the well-paced FX are all brought together with some neat direction by Australian Craig Gillespie - along with a Carter Burwell score. The atmospheric end title song 'Haul Away Joe' performed by Kodaline caps it off nicely (not to mention all those remarkable 50s cars!). All up it's refreshing, quite believable, high voltage entertainment, for those who want more than the comic book situations we get thrown at us all too often. This one definitely deserves more attention and is recommended for a good night's inspirational entertainment - that most audiences should enjoy.",9,0,0,19 June 2017
War Dogs," War Dogs - Beware lest You Get Bitten
","Not getting into technical stuff for this one - that's already been covered elsewhere - just a comment on content and outcomes. Being loosely based on fact it's fitting these characterless characters went to Gaol for their part in a military arms deal gone wrong - couldn't happen to a better pair (wonder if they will learn anything positive?) These foul-mouthed, smart ass 'buddies', care not for most anything in life - other than making bad money and lots of it. Never mind what grief or damage it causes as long as they are rich! These are the pits of this generation - who can't always seem to get why anyone could not care about them.The best thing this movie highlights is the ugly 'economy' of war! Overall it's well enough done and keeps you going but you pretty well know where it's going anyway and we've seen plenty of other shows about these types of low life anyway. Scatter brains will 'love' these near soulless bods but thankfully, others will see right through them.",Null,1,1,7 September 2017
Child 44," Child 44 - Suffers Lack Of Care
","A story with promise and an interesting setting (serial child murders in Russia during WWII and beyond) is left labouring due to overbearing treatment. It suffers throughout from cinematography featuring clumsy hand-held cameras and zoom lenses set too close to the subjects - giving a suffocated and incomplete feel to the narrative. The entire treatment is dark and grotty and while this can sometimes be an atmospheric plus, here it's so unrelenting it becomes tiresome. Overly convoluted 'style' and heavy violence tend to be used as substitutes for quality story elements - this could leave some viewers unsatisfied - forced dialects are also off-putting and quickly become annoying. Fans of the stars Tom Hardy & Gary Oldman (the latter's role surfacing in the last half only!) may survive to the finish while others might give up way before the lengthy 2h 17m is halfway through.",Null,0,0,23 April 2018
Detroit," Detriot - An Unpleasant Revisitation
","Director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal's 'Detroit' is a gruelling watch, not just for the fact it's based on shockingly violent, and tragic events in modern USA history but because the screenplay interferes with certain facts for the sake of 'entertainment'. While it may be the screenwriters task to 'dress-up' the content of a movie it's not their task to pad it out with violent falsehoods till it begins to lose sight of its fact-based situation. Many scenes tend to play out as unnecessary, and often they are. The main story line focuses on the deadly 1967 race riots that already feature enough tension and brutality to sustain viewer concern.It's uncertain what moviemakers feel they can add to these terrible events decades later - within an artificial re-enactment (maybe a quality documentary would have been a better medium?) But, it's doubtful any good might come from this re-hashing of yesterday's hatreds - especially given the present climate of extreme 'identity politics' causing division between all races - this in itself, comes across as exploitative 'activism' pushing suspect negative agendas. Sometimes, revisiting certain ugly historical events can offer a moral compass - even giving us warnings signs if they are thoughtfully analysed (as with 'The Free State Of Jones' in '16) - While others, simply fuel more contempt and distrust, feeding increased hatred. Looking at the financial returns for this movie, its possible many prospective patrons may have had the wisdom to see this offering as unfortunately, one of the latter variety.",4,3,7,31 October 2018
Wind River," Wind River - Offers More Bluster Than Thoughtfulness
","This moody drama starts out well enough with long shots of a vast, foreboding snowbound wilderness and a young girl running towards an icy death - but, what follows by way of a wrap-up is basically an over the top stock n' trade-shoot 'em up - with tacked on moralising about Native American social issues. I support the comments about the shocking lack of demographics on missing Native American women and fail to comprehend why this shameful situation is allowed to exist - given our so-called 'equal opportunity' society. A solid documentary drawing attention to such an appalling lack of information could be far more beneficial than a commercial (for profit) 'entertainment' movie such as this. As interesting (and sensitive) as some of it certainly is, the poor sound, mumbling actors, cheap handheld camerawork and scant dialouge, are among other elements that don't offer the benefits they should.A somewhat unbelievable bunch of red-neck-white-eyes, who get thrown in as the kill happy villains - forms a rather messily written means-to-an-end that seems overly obvious. These heavy handed 'them and us' productions will do little to improve race relations - if sincerely out to make a quality statement, far more balance is needed - otherwise, it simply takes us back to history repeating itself without much contribution to a helpful resolve. This will entertain those who look, without particularly thinking too much about what they see and, maybe the title card 'Inspired by true events' could be a rather long bow to draw... apart from the sad demographic.",4,3,7,2 July 2018
I'm Not There," I'm Not There - You May Wish You Weren't Either
","Make way for a mega failure from the Weinstein company - written and directed by queer movie maker Todd Haynes. This mish-mash looks like a film school finalist effort and will please those very audience members who demand an unconventional (at any cost to the end result) approach to movie making. Film Festivals and academies will also be taken in by its pseudo academia and won't see the forest from the trees! Haynes also gives a nod to his own gender bending by casting a woman to play one of the many characters who make up the supposed Dylan interpretations. Here we have Blanchet camping it up to please the critics and 'certain' types of fans, etc. If this convoluted work is an homage to Dylan, then it's an unflattering one, if it's true to Dylan's personal attitudes then it shows him to be little more than a commercially marketed product. His latter conversion to Christianity and leaving his old persona behind is presented in a very bland way indeed - probably reflecting Haynes thoughts on the matter (in fact this whole exercise could be more about Haynes than Bob?). The Richard Gere cowboy character seems to be from another story altogether and largely offers only symbolic connection to Dylan - this is probably the most interesting as well as the least successful of the piece. Some will love this over indulged tosh, others, as the box-office returns clearly show, will certainly not. For small specialist audiences only.",Null,0,2,9 February 2018
Fight Club," Fight Club Fights Itself for Believability
","Seems all that has to be done to produce a contemporary pop art movie these days is; Make it look stylish, give it some obviously hidden messages (pseudo intelligent comment or otherwise), get a few good looking performers (popular names help), fill it up with raw graphic brutality to keep the juvenile audiences from realizing they are being fed foolish situations - dressed up to look intelligent. Here, the overall message is worthy but in an attempt to make it less obvious, it gets buried in mind numbing MTV style violence. So why bother? If you have something you believe is worth saying, then say it so a larger audience can share your concerns. It doesn't need to be conventional, just accessible!So many overstretched situations (near 2 ½ hrs) and grueling plot devises--all intended to be seriously examined--that become simply too foolish to take seriously and are even more unintentionally silly when you do. Overall, this comes across as another attempt to outdo 'A Clockwork Orange' for shock value and pop art sophistry. Many will be seduced by the abundance of style but serious story examiners will be unfortunately sent away laughingly disappointed or annoyed.",Null,0,1,14 August 2017
Spotlight," A Mesmerizing Spotlight On Our Failings
","Surpassing all my expectations 'Spotlight' is a genre of film making largely left behind for the air-headed action blockbuster. A genre overlooked at the expense of storytelling with the highest degree of integrity. I was pleased I didn't know more than the basics before heading to the Cinema and surprised to learn I had just watched a 130min film that moved at such a smart pace it seemed more like 90mins. Looking back over the list of award winning talent involved, coupled with the extended care they took with editing explained why. While not always agreeing with the glitzy awards process this is one of the few times I felt they got it right. The balance of voice over, and music under montages was flawless. Howard Shore's inspired score was special, managing to be melodic and actionful all at once. During one sequence, Shore propels a bed of rapidly edited investigative research images with an intense underscore, at the same time leaving me wanting to revisit the sound track just to enjoy the musicality. It's not all that common to be treated like thinking adults by modern commercial movie makers and it leaves this audience member wanting more. The whole exercise had the look and feel everyone involved wanted to leave a little part of themselves (for all the best reasons!) etched in motion picture history. Director Tom Mc Carthy (remembered for his part in creating that great story 'Up' in 2009) creates another winner. The sterling cast and crew are all deserving of their awards and nominations. It's also to be hoped this work may go towards convincing the perverted and sick to stay away from institutions whose sole purpose should be to serve as 'carers', not for gaining opportunistic access to the less fortunate. And perhaps if humanly possible, recognize and seek treatment for their afflictions, not inflict them on others. All institutions must take responsibility for those they employ and how they conduct themselves to protect the vulnerable. The astonishing level of research details given within the end credits show a shocking pattern of actions taken by the Vatican 'city' in moving offenders out of prime positions throughout the world, into 'prime' positions within that very 'city' or otherwise.When an institution supposedly dedicated to the word of GOD begins making and serving its own laws, there's little hope it can any longer genuinely serve God or humanity. As for the law society and their part in these and other atrocities...there's an equal measure of shame. Even, as this brave film demonstrates, journalists themselves are not without guilt. Can we also dare to consider this work may possibly contribute towards lifting the level of support for 'quality' journalism in these days of superficial 'social' media!!?Bravo all round (and a nod of recognition for that other great Boston establishment WGBH for their past years of similarly great documentaries that this movie reminded me of) Note to caring parents (if any still out there). Took a star off for patches of not always necessary crude dialog. KenR",9,3,6,13 March 2016
L.A. Confidential," Come Back Hoppy Seems We Still Need You....
","I'm treading on thin ice here as this movie is a 'Crowd Pleaser' so most viewers tend to like it. It has all the elements of a commercial hit; Stylish direction and photography, smart story, slick screenplay adaptation, savvy performances, big budget production details, sex, brutality + violence with coarse language laid on - what more could you want?... Well, dare I ask for a little more credibility?. This script is perhaps at times a bit too smart for its own good.Ex Golf Caddie and original story writer James Ellroy often refers to himself as 'the best crime writer of all time' (that's a high calling for a writer to hang on himself!). Ellroy's a heavy drinker, Benzedrex abuser and gun lobbyist (he owns over 30 firearms!) so, his characters use guns more often than not. His writings also owe more than a passing nod to Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and Jack Webb. The screenplay adaption by writer Brian Helgland and director Curtis Hanson hones several layers off Ellroy's original but remains highly complex (Ellroy had mixed feelings about the end result). Tough cop Bud White (an outright thug) played by Crowe - retains some of Ellroy's own personal life characteristics (mother raped and murdered in his youth) so he has a vicious agenda all his own - but when it suits he's a 'nice' guy at heart - well, sometimes... Director Hanson seems to enjoy violence so lays it on thick - that's OK if it's believable - but, here our 'hero's' (etall) are subjected to brutal bashings of the type that you just don't get up and walk away from (let alone able to speak all that well for a day or two) but somehow they manage to front up next day with a little face rouge and not even a slight limp. Some even take several direct point-blank gunshot hits to the body only to re-appear with a few bandages. Ahh Hollywood at it's best. If discretion of speech is more than eloquence - then the on screen language is about as bad as it gets. Most of the above won't bother too many modern movie fans who've become so desensitized not many will make overly intelligent observations of these over-the-top details. The complexities of the story had the potential to be equally as interesting with half the heavy handedness and could've perhaps appealed to a larger cross section of the public.Friends told me they saw this as an 'in-flight' movie back when airlines used to screen special (softer) versions of films - they enjoyed it - but were disappointed when they went to the Cinema for a second look. It's interesting that this movie had enough going for it without all the ultra 'realism'. Italian born Director of photography Dante Spinotti manages to capture all the action without getting in the way of the story. Award winning composer Gerry Golsmith's sultry music score seems to owe quite a bit to Leonard Bernstein's main title for 'On The Waterfront' - coincidence or design?. As for Kim Basinger's Academy Award winning performance, well... Action and blood 'n gore crime fans will love it - most general viewers may also but, perhaps with more than a little compromise.Not 'fully' sure why the addition of a clip featuring the man in black (William 'Hopalong' Boyd) on his white horse has been inserted into the end credits - symbolic or just a reference to the era...?",6,2,5,3 July 2016
Concussion," Concussion Is Ahead Of The Game
","Looked at this movie without having read any reviews or related articles. The synopsis alone read like it should be seen and thankfully it did not disappoint. This based-on-fact story of Nigerian born Dr Bennet Omalu, offers a truly riveting and rare modern movie experience.From the performances, direction, cinematography, right down to the music score this is Superior film making. It's a worthy film that outlines the threat of CTE on contact sport players. The high profile NRL tried to squash this information by arranging for its own independent follow-up 'investigations' - basically performed by high flying on-the-payroll 'Doctors and researchers' - to push Dr Omalu's case out of the headlines and away from public attention. As with the cigarette corporations, these death-for-profit merchants almost succeeded but for the continued efforts of a dedicated few and some 'thinking' players who eventually began to wake-up to their own serious conditions.Will Smith is just about the whole show - can't think of too many that could have brought such an understated honesty to this important role. Right down to rejecting a 'comfort' offer from the White House for a position of 'convenience'. If you have a passion for seeking truth and enjoy an entertainment with a little more intelligence, it could be right here waiting for you.....",9,2,4,1 March 2017
The Day After Tomorrow," The Day After Tomorrow - Don't Go There
","Someone thought this is a credible examination of what could happen if we don't take Climate Change seriously. Seriously, could anything be further from the truth? We all know the climate is changing, it's been changing since creation but the warming science remains challenged by a vast number of the world's top scientists. It's difficult to know where to start with this catastrophe of a movie - yes, it has some good looking CGI but what's the benefit if the story is as silly as a kids matinee film from the 50s?We see tents that don't freeze while every building in the entire city of NY have frozen over - we see a payphone that still works even though its submerged under sub zero waters, we see people being kept alive by the burning of the pages of some books (while they are surrounded by wooden furniture!) We see a global weather pattern that alters in a matter of hours instead of years (centuries). We see people being able to run and perform exhausting feats without any breathing difficulties whatsoever.We see, oh, why bother... for those looking for mindless disaster entertainment it might work, provided you can turn a blind eye to a ton of cartoonish scientific inaccuracies. No wonder today's kids are reduced to anxiety and fear about their environment and see no hope for tomorrow. Pity they aren't able to recognise when a democratic propaganda piece is selling Al Gore's suspect 'science' for the benefit of very rich (getting richer) global companies. Perhaps all thats missing is Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead. Suppose we couldn't expect much more from this director.",3,0,3,28 November 2019
Hotel Rwanda," Hotel Rwanda - Makes Us Consider
","British Co-writer, producer/director Terry George (The Promise '17) has certainly carved out a name for being a maker of films to give us cause to think. He's also capable of showing the un-show able without resorting to sensationalised cinema 'stylized' violence - in fact, his great control allows us to be horrified & moved to tears with a remarkable lack of explicitness. So effective is his approach, the viewer feels as though they were watching an unfolding documentary account. His performers give remarkably convincing portrayals, leaving no doubt that cast and crew all shared Mr George's passion for this tragic cause. Excellent production values ensure an involving experience without overdone visual CGI excesses - making all that we do see so convincingly real. Some have drawn comparisons to Schindler's List but, that was stylized Hollywood, where' Rwanda' is all raw soul - giving it a far more compelling believability. Much of the world apologised for its inaction --after the event-- but only following certain serving personnel and press witnesses having publicly shamed them into doing so. This brings into question the true effectiveness of the UN - and the responsibility of the politically 'economic' heart of the developed world.",9,2,2,4 June 2018
The Hateful Eight," The Hate Filled 8th
","Seems a huge pity movies like this even find an audience let alone progress beyond the scripting stage. That people have lowered their expectations to Tarantino's sub-standard content is incomprehensible. Some misguided individuals tend to think sensationalist 'nigger' calling (among endless other perversions) coupled with violence on both sides, acts as a deterrent for racial bias, not so - it's more likely to encourage it! Looking at just one aspect of the technical dept; Producer/distributors like the Weinsteins will foolishly give this hugely overrated movie maker large sums of money to play out his immature fantasies, so they can garner profits from his folly. Who else would be fool enough to indulge him with a budget that allows for Filming in Ultra Panavision 70mm? – especially for a film where up to 90% of story takes place in a dingy snow bound cabin?! It's also little wonder this director covers himself by using the same cinematographer for the majority of his works - without this talented chap to grace his titles they would probably look rather limp. With all this money and talent, technical reality is still thrown away with the obvious over lighting of a set - which in all historic fact, could only have been a dim candle lit situation – sure we all want to see the subject but, such super bright led lighting in the 1800's is rather ludicrous. Taking a quick look at the moral dept; Further testimonies to a general lowering of standards can be found within some of the analyses written about the subjects of these movies. When third rate hatred and ultra violence replaces intelligent observation or character study - it shows critics and fans have allowed themselves to become blinkered. Some, unbelievably, argue these movies are serious studies of social history, while completely overlooking the simpleton approach taken with dialogue, characterisations, and historical accuracy. Only an industry out to make profits from over the top graphic violence and obscenity would defend these actions - against claims made by numerous health professionals the world over. In one particularly repugnant sequence a victim is stripped naked at gunpoint, forced to walk through snow, then told they would be spared if they performed fellatio while the perpetrator screamed obscenities – only to be shot through the head at the end of the act. What is this if not the writer/director's own perversions being acted out on screen? So much extended moronic nonsense is thrown at the audience including someone being shot between the legs at point blank range, then somehow being able to laugh while they drag a woman's body (dangling at the end of a hangman's rope) up and over a ceiling rafter - with the energy to hold her struggling body in the air till she dies. It beggars belief that anyone could write such trash let alone commit it to film. What's in the minds of those who laud this stuff? - certainly not intelligence or any understanding of morality.Prolific Italian composer Ennio Morricone said after his first collaboration with Tarantino he would never work with him again. Tarantino knowing the value of having Morricone's name on his credits - simply made an offer he could not refuse, giving even more of the producers finances to entice him back. While the Academy saw fit to award an Oscar to the score, it remains just another re-run of earlier Morricone works and sounds every bit like the composer never saw a frame of the movie (which he didn't!). Morricone was 'too busy' to look at any of the footage and simply sent in a score that, many others agree, was then rather poorly used in the final cut. Such an odd business. Yet again Tarrantino copies Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West' (+ others) right down to the over-length 3hr running time (someone should introduce him to the cutting room floor). The endless episodic 'Chapters' and somewhat corny voice-over, at times reduce the pace to a plodding bore. If this is Tarantino's 8th movie – then spare us the 9th and 10th. Hang up your guns or consider turning them on yourself and spare the world any further sludge.",Null,9,15,16 January 2017
The Book Thief," A Shining Gem In The Darkness
","'The Book Thief' is certainly a rare kind of film for its day. It gleams like the sun, glistens like rays on the surface of water - for here is a dark tale that lights up the very soul. I've read several 'professional' reviews for this work and it seems too easy for some Critics to sit in their comfortable cinema seats, or arm chairs in the safety of their homes, and write, what often amount to trite comments. They can read meaning (often their own) into works of crude ugliness, yet feel they have to hide from life affirming warmth. From the very opening scenes this film draws you in. Some did not like the fact that death (as voice over) begins to tell the story, but this also served to make it all the more compelling. Screen play adapter: Michael Petroni who's been associated with such diverse works as 'The Rite' and 'Narnia' is equally at home writing for the BIG screen as well as TV. As is talented Director: Brian Percival (Downton Abbey & North and South) Both seem to have given their all, and with no less than 6 various producers, there seemed to be plenty of money to assure superb production values ~ guaranteeing a great look and feel. Director of Photography: German born Florian Ballhaus, captures the magnificence of the carefully selected locations, lifting astounding images from the pages of the book onto the screen. The cast all work hard to bring to life the characters from Markus Zusak's novel. Child actors can sometimes be hit or miss but award winning Sophie Nelisse (Liesel) is reminiscent of the great Patricia Gozzi from the 60s (Sundays and Cybele '62 & Rapture '65) She convinces over a full range of emotions. Young Nico Liersch scores equally as Rudy.Some cynical critics seem to have difficulty in understanding the intellect of children forced to grow up in terrible circumstances and may have been unnecessarily harsh. Rush is reliable as always, managing to convey the emotions of a man living with fear, yet playing it down for the sake of his young adopted charge. John Williams' multi-layered music score brings to mind the style of strong scores that helped breath life into great classics from the past.Films of this quality have become rare in these days of often foolish, Hollywood comic book action blockbusters, but it's hoped this, along with 'The Railway Man' might see us treated to more intelligent modern cinema. If I'd change anything, perhaps it could be the anticlimactic style of the closing scenes ~ looked as if more may have been added as afterthought, through one too many fade outs (a very minor point) But more importantly, perhaps, some cynical critics may also be 'reminded of their humanity'.",8,49,65,26 January 2014
Capote," Capote - Will The Real Truman Please Stand
","Capote is one of those productions that leaves the viewer wrestling with many questions, like: Where does the 'truth' lie ~ where does the manipulation of such a cunning writer like Capote begin and end & Who uses Who to the highest degree? ~ so many facets to consider. Is Capote capable of telling the truth? ~ are Truth and Lies one the same to this gifted but damaged character? Will we ever know? In interviews, Capote tells us he demanded complete control over the making of the film version of 'In Cold Blood' right down to the fact that he insisted on a complete cast of unknown actors. As it turned out, apart from Scott Wilson as one of the killers, it has a very well known cast indeed. Then we learn that the director Richard Brooks, is also the producer , as well as the screenplay writer - with no credit suggesting that Capote had any involvement whatever other than selling the rights to the book. There won't be many (if any) telling Brooks what he can and can't do. One other story tells us that Truman contacted Brooks to complain about him employing a Blackman to compose the music score and, that he wanted Brooks to sack him, with Brooks telling Capote where to go in no uncertain terms...so much for his claims with all these demands. As for the suggestion that he never wrote another book after 'In Cold Blood' because of the 'emotional' effect that accompanied it - this also seems a bit of a stretch. With millions of copies to his credit, an endless supply of booze and over-the-top lifestyle luxury, would he ever need to? Anyway, apart from the mysteries surrounding these questions 'Capote' as a movie production is quality all the way, with a stand-out performance by the late Seymour Hoffman and fine direction to keep the slower story elements constantly entertaining. Of particular note is, director Bennett Miller and screen play writer Dan Futterman give us various revealing clues to the double sided nature of Capote - one such has Harper Lee responding to a statement during a phone conversation where Capote says words to the effect 'While he tried, he could not stop the executions of these men he was writing about' to which she responds 'Maybe not. The fact is you didn't want to'!",8,0,0,9 July 2018

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," 3 Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri - Sells Little At All
","Lately, when many people see Awards being dished out to movies they begin to think twice about their worth, in much the same way as when advertisers spend up BIG to tell us their latest product is the BEST on the market - you can often expect a cop-out. With Francis McDormand heading up the cast you might expect the Cohen Bros may have been somewhere in the wings to push it along - in fact, this work offers many of the depressing earmarks of some lesser Cohen productions (maybe that's partly why the Academy selected it?) The overly sensationalistic mix contains all the ingredients that one could cram into a plot filled with a continuous succession of near impossible coincidences (not to mention some perverse PC agenda pushing) With little or no character development and too many stretched situations - we are taken through a series of shocking actions that would land anyone committing just half of them, in jail or would have the local community after the perpetuator's blood! - but no, our 'hero 'Francis violently assaults school kids, dentists, and near anyone she feels like with few saying little more than boo. And for those who attempt to excuse this as 'black humour' - the 'humour' is just so 'simplistically' dark as to be virtually invisible.The local police (an unconvincing bunch of simplistic stereotypes) bash people near to death in broad daylight, and this is all taken as just another day in a town where every inhabitant tends to be on the edge of a mental meltdown. There's almost no-one the viewer can emotionally identify with or support - unless they too, are on the loopy side of Mental Health Denial. Add to the above, a lazy writer determined to create a swear fest - where all the foulest of outright mean language is paraded - in an attempt to out-shock any that's gone before. This is juvenile trendiness in the extreme.Viewers bright enough to see beyond a manipulative piece of exploitation - may see this rather pretentiously overrated concoction for what it is. While it attracted a lot of people to the ticket box, it's obvious from the Huge amount of viewer feedback - published on IMDb, etc; many of these audiences were bitterly disappointed and would like both their time and money back. And, lets not even get started on the pathetic ending.The end credits thank the local inhabitants for their co-operation but, I somehow doubt many would welcome them back - given the image painted of them!

Lion," Lion-Hearted
","Even though looking forward to seeing it - I was sceptical about 'Lion' and remain so with regards to a couple of story elements (screenplay to blame?) Otherwise, there was little to disappoint as it carried the viewer deeper into its harrowing situations. It's a difficult film to review as it's not in any way your standard story. Lion is a gut tearing true story about the fear of separation and extreme loss of the safety of family. The horror of seeing vulnerable children placed in shocking institutions - controlled by vile people - who should never be placed in positions of access, brings home the desperation of third world poverty. The screenplay by Luke Davis represents an adaption of the autobiographical novel by Saroo Brierley (Sheru Khan) and does well to capture the 'sweep' of the dramatic situations. Although, much credit has to go to Australian director Garth Davis, with this, his first feature movie. Both the dramatic production and sound designs are enhanced superbly with score music by two pianists, German, Hauschka and American, Dustin J. O'Halloran. This combination adds a strong atmospheric soundscape throughout this thoughtful film. The cinematography (on both sides of the world) is quite stunning with just a few minor scenes suffering shaky hand-held shots. Some say the movies pace changes for the last half – I would think it should, as the first half is a desperate search - leaving a definite need to allow for some serious introspection on the 'lost' lad's newly adopted life - in this strange land. This journey is never 'slow' as the searching for his soul family is ever ongoing. Performances by all concerned are heartfelt (despite what some may say) making Lion an exceptional experience that should not be missed by admirers of quality fact- based storytelling.",8,1,1,5 October 2017
The Lost City of Z," The Lost City of Z - Offers Much to Contemplate
","Director/Producer/Writer James Gray certainly takes on complex subjects - giving himself some difficult tasks as well as a challenge for his distributors. As with his lushly detailed 'The Immigrant' in'13, 'The Lost City of Z' presents us with a series of dazzling images from prolific director of photography Darius Khondji, to grace this haunting, factual, unsolved expedition into the jungles of Peru. The title (while accurate) may be an unwise choice as it suggests a silly Indiana Jones type adventure yarn - and that, this high quality, serious, movie is defiantly not. This feeling can be picked up through the tone of some unkind viewer comments from those only wanting cheap action fiction. Superb locations, performances, and a lush music score all contribute to an engaging cinema experience. While the movie is quite longish (though, fully sustained) one curious problem re-occurs in several sections - that the film looks as it may have been edited from a longer narrative via pre or post-production cuts. If this were the case then it would explain some odd continuity gaps tending to leave the viewer to fathom out some unexplained time shifts. Otherwise, it's always compelling and offers totally professional production values to recommend it to the discerning viewer.",8,1,2,9 June 2018
Notting Hill," Notting Hill Review - Big On Little
","If you're a hopeless romantic (as I tend to be) you may last the distance of this way overlong, crudish, fairytale. By the first 20mins I was getting somewhat restless and my viewing accomplice simply said, enough is enough, then got up and left. I waited to see if it got better - it didn't. Hugh Grant is typecast (or should that be miscast?) as the by the numbers coy, clumsy, bookstore owner - while Julia Roberts does her best to convince, as the poor-little-rich-movie star. Both have to deal with a forced, unrealistic, script by the same writing team of '4 weddings and a Funeral' (& it shows) with a dreary slow pace. Example; if you can swallow the idea that an International Mega-Star beauty, can walk unnoticed through the streets and shops of London - without attracting any Paparazzi! Or on the other hand, that a nobody, spreading a rumour one night in a local pub, can bring a street blocking avalanche of international press to an unknown 'private' address - then you might enjoy this outlandish 'would-be' situation comedy. Ms Roberts knows only too well, how impossible it would be for her character to get away with this super-stretched situation.It's amazing what star power can do to convince some audiences to part with their money. If you happen to be in the right starry-eyed mood (like; newly in love or just won the lottery) you could possibly be the right audience for this fluff - otherwise, don't expect too much, look for something worthwhile or just steer clear. If this is being touted as one the best romantic movies of its year - then, seems to suggest there may have been lean pickings on offer. As with too many movies of this era, the soundtrack is overloaded with unnecessary pop songs to fill in for gaps in dialog (and sell S/T CDs). To each their own.Best point; It offers a role for a disabled character to be shown in a positive light.",3,0,7,15 March 2019
Burn After Reading," S..t Happens
","The Cohen Brothers tend to appeal mainly to folk who 'think' themselves smarter than most other viewers or to those who seek-out movies they think are somehow 'different'. Perhaps they're only fooling themselves (I know, I used to be one of the deluded). These ultra cynical movie makers make films for themselves - showing their contempt for just about everything - including their audiences. Also seems maybe some audiences are often not smart enough to recognize most of their work is a recycling of what they've done before IE; settings, names, places, comedy, drama, are switched to camouflage the obvious. As the budgets get fatter the content gets thinner.For the most part I enjoyed the quirky warmth of 'The Hudsucker Proxy' but the majority of other Cohen efforts were simply callous, soulless, sensation seekers. 'Burn After Reading' is simply 'trendy' empty-headedness dressed up as satire. Cheap writing by people with more money than integrity. Lazy, crude language masquerading as humour. Good performers being reduced to accepting inferior farce and cardboard cut-out characters just because it's a 'Cohen picture'. Honest reviews by Variety, The New Yorker, Time, etc, and a closer look at many of the comments posted by ex die-hard fans on IMDb - seem to be saying maybe the party's over and many of us over them!. The industries 'promo-awards' divisions might miss them but, maybe it's time to move on chaps while you still have an audience of any note...Could be the title referred to the script.",Null,0,1,6 August 2016
Bridge of Spies," Spy Chase Spielberg Style
","Although very good to look at and mostly continually interesting (while maybe a little over length) this bridge may not hold as much weight as it could have. I suppose we should know what we can expect with Spielberg at the helm. While I agree this is one of his better movies, it still offers the usual over exaggerated bits just to liven up the action - while some facts get overlooked for the sake of 'entertainment'.We don't get to know anything about the character the whole show is built around - not even what his bit of folded paper was all about, so have to assume this was perhaps mocked-up to hold our interest. Mr Hank's wife is just a bit too difficult to believe - especially her reaction after their home and family get shot up!- then again, with that whole segment being a fabricated beat-up (this looks like Cohen Bros stuff) I guess it also fits in with the way Hollywood saw 50's women. It's mostly good based on fact dramatic entertainment with an element of fanciful trimmings - what more could be expected of a Spielberg/Cohen partnership?. Another positive comes in the way Award winner Marc Rylance as Abel (the spy) and Tom Hanks as his defense, perfectly bounce words and glances off each other.",7,0,1,20 October 2016
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo - May she stay Away
","Had I known the combination of screen writer Steven Zaillian (Gangs of NY '95) and director David Fincher (Fight Club' 99) were involved with this sour mess I would have stayed away. Many people who paid good money to see this must have come away wishing they had not. The director tells us he is drawn to works that 'scar' the audience, a sure recommendation for like minded masochists. I see several reviewers have said 'it leaves you wanting to cleanse yourself'. I see their point. The most accurate mainstream critical notes on this came from the N.Y.Post where Kyle Smith was brave enough to label it: 'rubbish' - commenting that it 'demonstrates merely that masses will thrill to an unaffecting, badly written, psychologically shallow and deeply unlikely pulp story so long as you allow them to feel sanctified by the occasional meaningless reference to feminism or Nazis.' I have to agree 'Bravo Kyle' as do many other astutely observant user reviewers! As the lead, Daniel Craig largely seems uninvolved or simply embarrassed that the writer presents him as one of the dumbest private detectives on screen. Enter the 'girl' – she also never learns and makes the same mistakes several times (with the same vile character) leaving her a victim to hideous sexual abuse – it becomes obvious both writer and director are living out their lurid sick fantasies with unnecessarily gratuitous details, giving one or both away seriously.The sudden U turn by the 'girl' for no truly convincing reason - going from a man hating lesbian to 'totally-in-love' with the detective, is yet another excuse for the makers to overload their already weak script with multiple sex scenes for the unwashed. Add to this, an overly convoluted script with so many manipulative elements that it at times becomes laughable (except it's all too grotesque). This typifies the commonality of the academy and trendy critics with their out-of- touch stance with many audience attitudes. As others have already said: Please, don't remake the follow up stories - leave well enough alone. For those who don't mind what pollution they put into their heads, this might please, others may care to look elsewhere.",Null,1,1,9 September 2017
Dunkirk," Dunkirk - Survive at all Costs.
","Definitely a one of a kind interpretation of the events that led to the WW11 evacuation of the beach at Dunkirk. War is wasteful and devastating (but also grotesquely profitable for some!) and political leaders of all persuasions gravitate towards it as a means to an end or for ultimate greed. Quite surprisingly the limited dialogue approach works well enough and allows the events that make up these harrowing stories to unravel at their own pace. It won't be for everyone, especially those who have a liking for conventional style war movies featuring individual heroes of the day. If anything, it pays homage to ALL those who suffered at the hands of the tyrannical force that destroyed so much within people's lives across Europe. Striking aerial footage puts the viewer in the cockpit and forces us to share the fear and isolation of one to one combat in the skies. No-one escapes the carnage and if you do just happen to survive - it may never be the same for you again. Then, waiting for you on the other side was another war - for the home front! 
Yes, its approach is different but, successful for those who can think in terms of survival amid a terrible historic event. The almost mechanical music-soundscape adds to the eerie atmosphere - with this then made quite perfect by the carefully measured strains of Elgar, adding the right touch of civic pride, to highlight the remarkable arrival of the life-risking civilian small-craft flotilla. It's also pleasing to find an Epic that does not feel the need to outstay its welcome.",9,1,3,24 February 2018
The Machinist," The Machinist - Offers Up Cloned Goods
","The Machinist is yet another movie that looks stylish, is well acted, offers an intriguing plot - then goes on to begin looking overly familiar. It's obvious the filmmakers had an admiration for Hitchcock's 'Psycho', Polanski, Kubrick, (etc), and that's OK, but to then re-invent something that you-wish-you-had-made is little more than a form of plagiarism. There needs to be more than look-a-like characters, writing and directorial touches, similar musical tonality and photographic touches - there simply needs to be more 'originality' for anything creative to be regarded as involving art. The fact that lead performer Christian Bale, starved himself to the point of illness for this role is, dedicated to his craft, yes -but also pointlessly (and foolishly) over the top. The addition of the moviemakers (and writers) obsession with oral sex offered absolutely nothing to the main plot, so why? This work goes on to offer up one gross situation following another --for the sake of crude shock value--lacking true artistic integrity. Great (or even good) work - needs more than style and look alike value to be fully deserving of any worthy respect. An interesting try but, an overall fail. Lovers of 'downers' will be close to the only audience attracted to this disappointing morbidity.",3,2,2,3 September 2018
Jackie," Jackie - Feelings To Consider
","Jackie was not a film I wanted to see but gave in to the curiously of what they might do with it. As filmmaking it's highly effective and should draw most sensitive viewers into a dream like world of inner suffering. I'm sure there's much speculation involved in certain elements of this telling of Jackie Kennedy's confused state of mind during this terrible time in her life and our modern history. Direction, cinematography, and music, combine with impressive performances to bring to life this challenging project. In family matters I'm sure Jackie suffered much more than this script ventures to reveal - through her husband's shameless sexual exploits (only hinted at here) but grief for her children at being deprived of their famous father at such a young age must have added heavily to her own. I could well imagine that some of the behind the scenes actions within the Whitehouse at this crucial time might be rather accurate, in both the positive and negative departments. This production is to be commended for its sensitive handling of this delicate subject and also good to see Natalie Portman given a chance to play in material worthy of her talent (as against the wasted, sensationalised, 'Black Swan' script)",8,0,0,1 September 2018
Gone Girl," Gone Girl Goes Potty
","It's quite amazing how many people can be seduced by a little style and a few reasonable scenes. After an initially curious beginning 'Gone Girl' then tries to be so 'cleaver' it falls over its own foolishness. It has that look, sound, and feel, of so many other 'deliberately controversial' productions that come and go endlessly. Writer, Gillian Flynn has fashioned a yuppie story - then crammed it with yuppie dialogue, as if trying to outdo the crass situations and vile language of many others that went before this over-baked trendsetter. Her central characters are all unlikable, self-obsessed 'it's all about me' types and much, much worse. Her partner in crime, director David Fincher (House of Cards) attempts to squeeze so much nasty sensationalism into each sequence that it leaves the thinking viewer wanting to run from the room screaming...the whole thing then drags on for almost 2 ½ hrs with barely enough story to cover 80mins max. The too-dumb-for-their-own-good situations and unbelievable grisly murder set-ups are too dark to even write off as black humour – they're simply terrible. Just two examples of foolishness: In these days of endless social media, the 'grieving' husband (and prime suspect) poses for a smiling selfie with a perfect stranger, then says to her 'whatever you do don't show this anywhere'! – weak in the extreme. The wife, who is admitted to Hospital in the midst of a full-on police murder investigation - is let out a day or two later, still covered in blood! Simply laughable. Do audiences check their brains in at the ticket counter when attending these movies?Way too many other vulgar situations in this ugly nonsense to bother with - let alone the lame ending. Don't take my word for it - you will find there are many other reviewers from around the globe who have summed it up perfectly (that is, in between the promotional people, the immoral, and those who just don't want to think)Why did it take so much money? well, as so many others point out: 'you don't know what you're seeing till you've handed over your hard earned money'!",3,0,1,9 July 2017
Django Unchained," Django Unchained -Juvenile Gore or Django Unbrained?
","Yet another Tarantino exploitation cartoon that foolish critics and Awards committees have tarnished their names and reputations by stumbling blindly into the filmmaker's simplistic style of moviemaking. This 'style' is all about copy-cat plagiarism, which proves, if you make enough money from fooling people who should know better, you can thumb your way to the top of a bottom-rung industry. If you've seen one Tarantino movie you've seen them all, it's only the names and settings that change (slightly).This movie-maker is as readable as a child: the first rule of thumb; Take themes that spark controversy, over- exacerbate the violence and gore in order to hook those with a cause or agenda to push, and they will follow blindly to the ticket box - making the likes of supporters, Harvey Weinstein and a handful of overly familiar stars (mates) along with a full assortment of soulless industry associates very rich. Violence and lurid subjects appeal to the lowest common denominator the world over (only need to check out the daily news for some confirmation) and, the monkey see monkey do syndrome will unfortunately, always be with us, this also gives us a punishing three hours of torture to prove it.Handfuls of insightful commentators have seen through the thinly-veiled ugliness, and bravely called it out. See; Thomas Frank - Louis Farrakhan - and surprisingly, industry personalities such as fellow moviemaker Spike Lee, and actor/reviewer Jesse Williams, who all clearly see the folly of Tarantino being taken in any way seriously. Then there's the silliness of Michael Moore attempting to call it 'satire'! The most obvious rip-off in this piece of tosh is the spaghetti western, after all, what did Italy know about the experience of living through the American west? Europeans were simply enamoured by the 'romance' of watching fictional American westerns. Leone is blatantly copied right down to the choice of music (with even the composer, Morricone, calling Tarantino out for his lack of original ideas) The bulk of other music is as with most of this copyists work, lifted from other better films and too often unsuited to the era or narrative themes.Much more could be said but why bother, when consumers seem to love being coned - right down to their History, groceries, comic books, and so on...",2,4,7,19 January 2020
Velvet Goldmine," Dizzy Tizzy - All That Glitters Is Not Gold
","The premise of this movie reads better than the final visual outcome. Cultists will love it (they can excuse almost anything) but the end result tells us more about the film-maker than it does the Glam/Glitter rock era. From a very interesting opening (if a bit odd) and a couple of well staged scenes - it rapidly sinks into a sludge. Overloaded with repugnant themes and characters - it's not surprising so many from this era did not make it past age 40 (if they were so lucky), it sits well as an illustration of the walking dead - join them at your own peril.I can fully appreciate why David Bowie disliked the script so much - in fact, so much that he would not let any of his original tracks be used within this grotesque production. The best song is kept for the end ' Make Me Smile' by Steve Harley but, this is only played over the end credits and, the end credits come one and a half hours too late...If you know how to value your head space then for Gods sake, keep this slosh well away from it!",Null,2,3,25 October 2016
Room," A Room Without A View You Wont Forget Easily
","When the four main components that make a movie better than average are brought together the result can be striking. First, is the importance of a good script with a strong story that many should be able to relate to & when this essential element has its basis in fact, it's already well ahead. Emma Donoghue's script supplies all this. Follow with a director who has a personal passion to bring this particular story to life & Irish born (of Eastern Jewish parentage) Lenny Abrahamson was the right choice. If Performers have a large role in convincing us to care and feel for the subjects they play - this film certainly has those! Next comes someone to create images that will draw us into each situation and with Award nominee Cinematographer Danny Cohen ('The Kings Speech') this is almost perfectly achieved. I say almost, as the 11 x 11ft set he was given to capture a large degree of his shots in would have been extremely limiting - this no doubt created obstacles i'm sure everyone would have preferred to do without (referring to a couple of clumsy but minor, hand help shots). A sympathetic producer who wants the best result caps a good production off. Stephen Rennick's sensitive Music Score and carefully detailed Editing lifts this work even higher. Multi-talented Brie Larson certainly earned her well deserved Oscar as 'Ma', with young Jacob Tremblay surprisingly impressive as son Jack. All cast members work hard to make this harrowing film unfold in a naturalistic manner. When generally mindless 'action' movies win massive amounts of Awards and spend obscene amounts of money achieving this â€“ it's refreshing when a life affirming gem like 'Room' comes along to add balance to the industry. With the task of pleasing everybody being just about impossible - some won't be able to relate to 'Room's' highly claustrophobic, personal situations so, the hard and fast action aficionados won't understand the accolades. Others will be astounded and may even come back for a second visit. If being technical, I'm perhaps a little perplexed as how the 'garden shed' with its skylight kept the screams out of neighbor's ear range and the captors in for so long but, perhaps this demented captor had rebuilt the internals with heavily padded materials - I understand the original situation this story is based on took place in a European cellar (not sure why this was altered). Maybe the captor was also overly naive in not checking the body in the carpet (?). Other than these plot details , 'Room' is not to be missed by appreciators of discerning films.",9,1,5,1 February 2017
Hidden Figures," Hidden Figures Exposed
","This well acted, very good looking based on fact movie, offers high entertainment and information value. It's just a pity the screenplay writer/director Theodore Mefti, felt the need to exaggerate some elements of the truth. While much of what is examined certainly happened - I think the movie going public would still have enjoyed this story about three women working in different areas of America's NASA's calculations dept - without the embellishments added for 'entertainment' purposes. It tells the employment experiences of each Woman (3 Afro American friends) Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson in a parallel time frame. Set during the turbulent late 50's with its racially ugly segregationist laws, this script tends to give these women's situations more of a 'Them and Us' scenario than perhaps was actually called for. While I abhor racial hatred, and agree it should be shown for the nastiness it was (and often sadly remains) exaggerating the extent of certain situations can only add the unnecessary element of 'separationist' attitudes. Tell it like was but, do so as honestly as possible. Even with its uneven approach to certain situations this remains a worthy viewing experience - recommended to those studying the science of space travel, social intolerance and interracial advancement.",9,0,3,20 December 2017
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Goodnight, Yet Another Review, Good Luck.
","It would be difficult for serious viewers not to get excitedly caught up in this work. The American news and social commentator Edward R. Murrow was absolutely spot on with his predictions for the future of Television. He was right, not just regards news broadcasting but across the full programming spectrum! And sadly, seems the perpetuation of its ethical downfall lies in the gullibility of viewing audiences who have become equal partners in crime - allowing themselves to be dragged down into the sludge alongside the programmers, writers, producers and sponsors.Many younger viewers won't even realize they are being compromised daily by the 'less is more' mentality of modern entertainments. I wonder if this important work might help some to question the ethics of a society where so-called grown-ups 'play' 'M and R' rated 'games' ad nauseum and TV News is dished out by matinée style pretty boys and girls - sandwiched between specially programmed promos, product placements, and a barrage of handpicked commercials. Murrow was seeing the giant CBS Corporation dump important social and ethical programs for easy revenue shovelled in with endless re-runs of mindless TV series. Other attempts at serious social comment like David Suskind's 'East Side West Side' series was dropped by CBS for upsetting some overly powerful sponsors (but hey, surely I understand that sponsors are more important than the truth...well, aren't they?)Only a couple of minor technical bits interrupted my enjoyment of this serious endeavor...the prolific use of super blow up zoom type lenses to give that 'fly-on-the-wall' feel, at times detracted from the 'look of the fifties' (as these lenses weren't even available in this era - tending to give the film a more 'resent' look). Not that I object at all to the use of modern technology in movies set in the past - it's just that in certain situations, when overused, it can have the effect of giving the subject a somewhat pretentious look. Joyously, most images were steady - some may have even been shot on tripods! This same style of photography was used to give 'The Downhill Racer' its 'documentary' feel back in the late 60's. A couple of shots appeared to have been compromised by some editing decisions (possibly telling us they had nothing else to replace them with) And OK... we know more people smoked in the health ignorant 40's and 50's but these shows look very much like they are playing the same game as did the major studios of the times, by taking money from cigarette companies to bankroll their projects. This has a tendency to look somewhat more than simple 'realism', to being a tad suspect. Another modern, over-written and endless TV series 'Mad Men', bears this same 'suss'look.Clooney shows no fear in some of his more intelligent projects and this is certainly one to be commended. Perhaps he is a little too in awe of his title character - to the extent of maybe manipulating his audience's emotions but, the equally manipulative bullying tactics of Communist witch hunter, Senator Joseph McCarthy also had to be highlighted - with this being done to strong effect by the use of archival footage. Anyone with a serious interest in the overzealous political pursuits of the day should see this one.",9,0,0,17 June 2015
Mulholland Drive," Mulholland Drive - A Ride To Nowhere
","Is this but further confirmation that perhaps the educated moron has dumbed down the logical thinking of the 'art' world? Are people so easily influenced by the perverse leanings of eccentric movie makers - who specialize in subjects that allow them to wallow in their own warped sensibilities? David Lynch could possibly be one to fit this group – here he throws at us a 'story' made up of bits 'n pieces that were intended to make up a proposed TV series - that was then canned by the studio. To hide the fact it's an amalgam of stories that don't fit well together he camouflages the mess with absurd characters and weird situations. It's given tons of moody lighting, stylized sets, clips, and atmospheric camera angles - all adding up to more Style than Substance. It then drags on far too long (147m). At first, it looks intriguing, making you wonder where it's heading but, with no relief from the ugly ramblings and too many dead ends, it simply frustrates by falling over its own pointlessness.Lynch then overindulges himself with his bent towards cheap girl-on- girl sexual erotica. It looks more like a copy of Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' with its overtly seedy sexual overtones that also fed Kubrick's soulless fantasies. It's revealing to note just where today's trending high praise comes from, and what it's being dished- out towards. Those who set the bench marks for creative 'genius' are quite happy to spend endless hours analyzing thin, sketchy works like this – works that the movie maker can't even explain but then, that's 'post-modern' sensibilities all summed up within its own shallowness. An empty exercise in over the top 'creative' sophistry.Thankfully, there remain some still capable of seeing through the fog of deception. Just one of these is Film Theorist Ray Carney, who perfectly observed all this in his summary (with words to the effect...) 'It's full of narrative trap doors, with nowhere to go, and nothing to say, and characters without souls'. Sadly, sounds a bit like some current movie makers and historians.Fortunately, from the look of numerous user reviews, audiences still require more from their entertainment.

Black Snake Moan," Black Snake Moan - Causes Groans All Around
","This sexploitatioal Paramount Vantage release cost some millions and lost most of them, and it's easy to see why. Writer/director Craig Brewer seemed to be getting his rocks off with his half naked nymphomaniac character - grimly played by Christina Ricci - who pops pills, swilling them down with alcohol, between getting her gear off with any number of the unwashed locals - only to end up bashed and dumped by the side of the road. Enter black farmer and ex-blues singer (Sam. L. Jackson) who decides the only way to 'save' her is to chain her to his fireplace (literally!)

Into the Wild," Into the Wild: What Did It All Prove?
","Screenplay writer and director of Into the Wild, Sean Penn, has been quoted as having the following to say about Terence Malick's 2011 film 'The Tree Of Life'... 'The screenplay is the most magnificent one I've ever read but I couldn't find that same emotion on screen, a more conventional narrative would have helped the film'. This maybe quite so, but perhaps similar could also be said of his film. As with Malick, Penn extends his subject material till it reaches breaking point and becomes tedious.One of the biggest problems for the subject in this case, is Christopher McCandless, a top Emory Uni student who in a moment of teen angst gives away all his savings, leaves his family without even a word of goodbye and heads out into the dangerous wilds towards Alaska. Sadly, this in itself is immaturity at the height of its ignorance. He's fleeing from parents who seem to disagree between themselves (as seen from the viewpoint of his youthful inexperience of marital problems), they don't understand him (but support his everyday existence needs) and a sister he is supposed to care very much for. Christopher foolishly casts his only remaining money into a fire, then blindly stumbles from one bad situation to the next - eventually having to take jobs with fast food outlets in several failed attempts to support himself. This all goes on interminably for 2 1/2 Hrs. While the landscapes are handsomely captured by documentary photographer Eric Gautier (this feature would have actually been better suited to a 1 Hr TV documentary), it rambles on until our hapless traveler manages to kill himself eating poisonous berries. There are the customary message songs of troubled youth to pad out the moments lacking in solid story. Sadly these songs tend to sound a little tired and lacking conviction. This is not entirely surprising, as talented singer songwriter Eddie Vedder, had earlier written a song called 'Jeremy' about the foolishness of running from your problems and killing yourself instead of standing up and changing things! Wise words. In the performance stakes, Hal Holbrook fares best as a caring, aged widower who befriends Christopher (who in turn proceeds to lecture the old man about getting more out of his life). Today's youth sure do get a bellyful of life long experience at an incredibly early age! The reliable William Hurt looks very well preserved as Chris's Dad. Christopher, ultimately destroyed his family, along with all the positive things he could have contributed to by living. I, like many, also left home, went through all this desperate youthful searching but figured it's better to come out on the other side and contribute to bettering life one way or other. Yes, it's a sad situation but now Mr Penn wants us to spend hours feeling sorry for this wasted foolishness.It's somehow difficult to appreciate the accolades dished out to this work by the Academy and some critics who, on a closer look, probably should know better. From the look of numerous other viewer comments, appears I may not be alone.",3,4,5,22 April 2016
Once Upon a Time in America," Once Upon A Time In America, There Was This Bomb...
","There seems perhaps something peculiar to certain Italian movie makers - as if there's a fault in their genes. Many tend to be attracted to themes over-saturated with cruelty and immorality of the vilest kind. Is it perhaps from their Roman heritage - or the dregs from too many wars? Sergio Leone, is just one example – he joins the list of Pasolini, Bertolucci, etc....I grew up thinking 'Once Upon A Time In The West' (and his other aptly named 'spaghetti 'westerns) were OK, until I revisited Leone's work years later – only then realizing how foolishly written and overblown they all were! 'Once Upon A Time In America' is more of the same, simply without the horses, different styles of guns, and a pan pipe replacing the harmonica! (and we're supposed to believe this toy would sound like Gheorghe Zampfir!!) You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. No matter what ridiculous sums of money you poor into a sloppy patch-work of a script in attempts to make it visually impressive - it still remains foolish. Seems most audiences are not so easily fooled as some critics and Hollywood types – this 30 million dollar splurge returned a measly $5 million. So, it's beginning to look like many of the 'rave' reviews may have been posted by some of those who lost 'BIG' money and just might be attempting to mark up some losses. After all, this is the picture that almost ruined the Ladd Company.The lush symphonic music all seems to have come from another film (in 'Once in America's' case it did! and sounds like it's still looking for the other movie!) Along with sumptuous photography it's all just a further attempt to dress up a ridiculous convoluted script - written by nine different writers! - then given a confusing shape to hide plot holes and poor development of character. Here is a movie overflowing with just about every type of perversion: repugnant brutality, extreme sexual immorality with violence, drugs, glorification of criminals and the gun - it simply drags on ad nauseous for more than 3 hrs of over-the-top ugliness. They say you must see this long version but the short Vera (still too long at near 2 1/2hrs) might have helped. The performers have done these characters in numerous other movies, so nothing new is being brought to this tiresome mess.If you're easily pleased and have lots of time to idle away you might last the distance - if not, stay away.",Null,33,72,17 April 2017
Snowden," Snowden Will Make You Think
","I don't usually have a great deal of respect for Stone's movies but Snowden is another matter. Seems maybe Stone has matured as a movie maker and not showing off as much as some earlier works suggest. This story gives us good reason to think far more about our leaders and the power of current high tech surveillance. It's to be hoped Snowden's motives were as well intended and idealistically slanted towards concerns for the general populace as we are being shown. If so, I salute him and Stone for this work. Interesting performances, great use of fine photographic technique and a thoughtful music score are a plus for this, at times unsettling movie. The Obama administration, as many of us knew, have much to explain and make amends for. Perhaps the reason this movie was not as popular as expected is that there have been many similarly themed works over the past several years that just may have come out too close to each other. On top of this, the dumbing down of some audiences with comic book type blockbusters never helps intelligent fare to gain strong circulation. As people learn more about these situations, I imagine this movie will benefit from more recognition. Recommended for thinking folk. Language is typical of other Stone works but the original, based on fact story, helps make up for some of it.",8,4,4,22 August 2017
Woman in Gold," Compelling History
","'Woman in Gold' makes for a dazzling movie experience (even if at times it may leave you questioning it's authenticity). Having not been an admirer of Mirren's early screen work - she seems to have become better with age (well, for me anyway), I was taken with her portrayal of Maria Altman from start to finish (as also in 'The Queen'). Ryan Reynolds gives good support as the young Lawyer taking on a case above his station. Reynolds, whose style is somewhat reminiscent of a young Kevin Costner, plays the Randol Schoenberg part with conviction.London born director Simon Curtis gives the proceedings an easy to watch style and with the help of documentary editor Peter Lambert, they keep the viewer engaged throughout. Curtis also gets to direct his American wife (in a guest style role) Elizabeth McGovern, who has since made England her home. First time feature screenplay writer Alexi Kaye Campbell has fashioned an interesting interpretation of the writings of Altman and Schoeenberg's own life experiences, looking back at yet another of humanity's all time low past atrocities - although as mentioned, for some, certain sections of the screenplay may not always ring true (?)Cinematographer Ross Emery (Matrix) gets a chance to prove he's also good without the help of tons of big budget CGI. It's hard to tell who did what with the music score, credited to both Martin Phipps and Hans Zimmer but, it's pleasing in an unobtrusive manor. Design Guru's, Andrew Ackland-Snow and brothers Dominic and Giles Masters (Harry Potter) with the help of others, ensure it looks good - perhaps while also getting a chance to strut their stuff without being drenched in CGI. As a minor point, some location settings in Austria seemed a little too devoid of people to give an accurate representation, still, it's an amazing human story, both informative and entertaining. It should please most sophisticated audiences, while letting us reflect on an episode from our dark past.",8,6,6,12 April 2016
The Legend of 1900," What's This! The Legend of a Sinking Ship...?
","Seems a lot of folk that watch movies, have the mistaken view that if a film looks in anyway whatsoever 'different' it 'must' be good!. I'd imagine that '1900' must have made some members of the Italian fine Arts Council, and all those listed in the credits for pouring tons of money into this fiasco, want to hide themselves in the rest-room after the premiere. They must to this day, still be hiding the investment figures from any government auditors ~ following a massive $9 Million dollars, that returned less than $260,000. The version my wife and I watched was the international, running a seemingly interminable 123 Min's. To think that some poor souls overseas had to sit through 170 Min's is untenable. As it was, my wife kept asking how much longer can they stretch this ridiculously thin material? Perhaps the original Monologue by Alessandro Baricco (if it was short enough) may have held up, but as an overblown movie, not quite so.Director: Giuseppe Tornatore (and his bank-rollers) must have thought that after the success of 'Cinema Paradiso' everything he touches will turn to gold. But as this movies huge losses showed...all that glitters is not gold. And 'glitter' this movie does, big time. The sets are HUGE, but overdone to the point of being unintentionally unconvincing. Director of Photography: Hungarian born Lajos Koltai works hard, but the story and situations are simply so outlandishly foolish, that he can only attempt to add some visual saving graces. I would even go so far to say the word 'Fable' was added to the publicity as a last minute bid to salvage a complete wreak, following audience reactions.As a collector of Ennio Morricone soundtracks, I even found this score uninspired, as if he too knew this one was was doomed to failure.If you're easily pleased, and love 'Arty' pretensions, then you might enjoy this not entirely successful overindulgence. As with another film of director Tornatore; the very stylish, sex fueled, foul mouthed entry 'Malena'...I hope to never suffer either again. Maybe '1900' is OK for those that like to add their own depth to shallow fiction. It's also possible it might have been better if it had been given a way less excessive treatment ~ or even a better choice of stars (these look as if they're wondering if they've wandered onto the wrong set) it might then have come a little closer to working, but wouldn't hold out too much hope....",2,4,12,12 April 2014
Love & Mercy," A Troubled Musical Journey
","The backwards/forwards style and pacing of this movie may put some viewers off but those who stay with it should be enthralled. To date, this is possibly one of the most accessible screen example of telling a story in dual time frames using two different performers. The life of popular musical genius Brian Wilson is quite harrowing - from a manipulative, abusive father to an opportunistic and equally abusive quack 'Dr' Eugene Landy. Landy stood to gain a large (and unworthy) share of Brian's legacy - and if not for the eventual intervention of various close family and friends would have succeeded in his attempts to drug Wilson to oblivion.The studio session scenes are highly revealing for the way they demonstrate the parallels of genius and mental instability. They also highlight the respect session musicians held for the time they spent working with Wilson. It seems this venue is possibly where Glen Campbell was introduced to Wilson - before being selected to stand in for Brian during a major tour. Performances, direction, photography and music combine to convincingly tell this talented artists troubled journey up to the present. The use of live, present day, concert footage during the end credits round off a compelling movie experience. While it might mean more to Beach Boys/Wilson followers or those who lived through the early years, it offers equal benefits to any follower of modern musical development.",8,2,2,4 December 2016
Sicario," Sicario Has Style But Has It Intelligence?
","The introduction for this film gave initial promise by shrewdly adding a title that states: Sicario were early warriors of Jerusalem who hunted down Roman invaders, but then goes on to tell us Sicario: also means Hit-Man in Mexican (doesn't leave much to aspire to). It's a studied exercise in the ugliness of today's drug trade – its main claim to fame lies in its overall style, both visual and directorial. Denis Villeneuvie's direction is taut (reminiscent in style to the interesting John Guillermin from the mid 50s – late 80s). Much of Sicario's success at seducing the audience to overlook several plot implausibility's is gained from the superb work of British cinematographer/cameraman Roger Deakins. This brilliant director of photography is worthy of higher projects to better use his considerable talents. It would have been interesting to have had the opportunity for him work with the likes of David Lean or Carol Reed. To date, perhaps the most intelligent use of his talent may have been 'Defence of the Realm' in '85 – with possibly the most stylish being 'The Hudsucker Proxy' in '94. I credit this fellow with adding much to the success of Cohen Bros movies than perhaps the often overrated Cohens themselves. There's also an evocative 'soundscape' score by Icelandic artist Johann Johannsson to help it along. As for the screenplay by TV actor Taylor Sheridan - it adds little new ground to a heavily pre-trodden scenario and if not for the combination of smart direction, photography and slick editing its many plot deficiencies would be even more self evident. If modern movies are going to set themselves up as realistically true to life, then there has to be a greater level of believability, otherwise they remain simply the 'artificial recreations of reality' they always have been – except now of course, they just have to be overloaded with all the vile language and grotesque violent details that can be crammed into an average two hour plot. This work also has the feel of many TV series that stretch-out thin plots to fill endless episodes. Thankfully this is all over in two hours. Sheridan's characters are mostly made up of so-called 'elite' professionals - lead by an idealistic female SWAT team member played by Emily Blunt (who holds her implausible character quite well) but, for high profile professionals they tend to make so many foolish decisions – Not to mention the many silly plot set-ups:(some minor spoilers here if not already seen) Sequences such as the corrupt policeman who just happened to be in an obscure roadside bar that is 'randomly' visited (totally without plan) by our heroine - coupled with the sudden appearance of her 'protector' are just too much to overlook. To top it off the Del Toro character's involvement is reduced down to just another clichéd 'revenge' plot – complete with his being able to gain access to one of the biggest players in the business by single-handily murdering all the personal protectors (who just happen to be in earshot of his victims but miraculously no-one hears anything) its just another of many stretches of credibility (like Kate's ex-SWAT partner who just happens to always be there, despite being previously rejected by the current government undercover team). There's also an ugly start to this folly with drug dealers hiding numerous badly decomposing bodies in the plaster wall cavities of a house. What possible purpose was that intended to serve? For those who simply watch movies and go blindly with the flow - without thinking - this is seemingly good entertainment but, for a movie to be hailed as great or award winning, there has to be more depth. So, if you are looking for something offering intelligence, you may not find it here.Also most disappointing is the obvious re-introduction of excessive cigarette smoking into movies (throughout the world) don't tell me this isn't deadly commercial product placement at its unsubtle worst - this sets the integrity of today's movie industry back over 50 years.",6,1,2,5 March 2017
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society - A Bygone Era
","There's a children's book somewhere in this curious title, and as it was finished by the author's niece, Annie Barrows (who happend to be a writer of children's books) it makes me wonder if this was her Auntie's original title? Mary Ann Shaffer, sadly died before her book was published, and from comments made by those who have read her novel - the film adaption is disappointing. That said, it's highly likely those who read the book, after seeing the movie, may find the reverse. Books and screenplay adaptations can be, and are, a world apart. On its own merits, this is a highly enjoyable movie - offering fine performances, direction, wonderful locations, superior cinematography and a convincing recreation of a past era.Lead actress Lily James, is like a dream come true - she was the perfect 'Cinderella' in '15, it's easy to understand why she won that part and the accolades. This story is an account of Germany's brutal occupation of Guernsey from 1940-45, detailing its dramatic impact on a group of families and friends. It's both a sentimental romantic tale and an examination of the tragedies experienced by all individuals living under siege. From other reviewer's comments - it might seem certain modern viewers may have perhaps lost the ability to appreciate the effect these times had on long suffering participants - so some might tend to view certain aspects of this tale with a degree of cynicism. But generally, the majority of audiences should be pleased with the time they spend being entertained by this engaging story.",8,0,0,13 February 2019
The Reader," The Reader Might Leave You Asking - Guilt or Lack Of?
","As more and more people in modern society fail to clearly identify the difference between Love and Lust – it's little wonder there are so many poor marriages and divorce. 'The Reader' is yet another of the many, so-called 'romantic' movies, spinning yarns of the power of first 'love'. In this case, it's the love/lust between a 15yr old lad and a 36yr old woman named Hanna (Winslet). She, as it turns out was an SS guard in a Nazi death camp during WW11 – we all know this situation 'she/they were just doing their job - like everyone else'. This particular story begins more than a decade after her war service. Now she's working as a tram conductor and the lad, is a student whom she assists in the street - following his suffering a fever-induced vomiting session. She takes him to her apartment, cleans him up and then assists him back to his parent's home. He returns with flowers to thank her and before we know it she has her clothes off and heavily involved in instant seduction – better known as 'lust'.It's not always easy to figure just what screenwriter David Hare and director Stephen Daldry are wanting to highlight as the chief focus of their adaptation of Bernhard Schlink's novel (as it tended to be with this duo's earlier collaboration, 'The Hours' in '02). The first section concentrates too heavily on the sexual relationship - with over detailed sequences featuring heavy bouts of nudity and sexual experiments. Reviewer, Thelma Adams of the Huffington Post quite rightly identified these scenes as borderline child pornography (little more than abuse). This activity has been carefully set-up to be 'accepted' by the viewer as the 'norm' but, is it really quite so? Hanna is a troubled woman and often treats her 'Kid' harshly. Following their summer 'encounters', she eventually disappears and her 'kid' is left seriously distressed and confused.It's here, the movie shifts its tone to become an examination of a war crimes trial. More ambiguity within the writing surfaces - with what amounts to being heavy scrutiny of whether it's worse to publicly admit being 'illiterate' or someone who assisted with murdering hundreds of innocent people? The movie is well acted and slickly photographed yet, seems very long for its two-hour running time. While it obviously pleased the academy (it doesn't take much these days) and some audiences – it will, and has, left serious analytical thinkers unhappy with what they will clearly 'read' between the lines.",Null,0,0,25 September 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Murder on the Orient Express - Kills Christie
","Style, style, style, sumptuous style and then some! Sets, trains-fabulous trains, costumes, performers, cinematography, music, what more could you ask? Well, maybe a more focused, and involving script with direction that knew what direction it wanted to take. Here's a good story that's maybe been reinvented one time too many. This glossy remake tries to be everything to everyone and that's been proven impossible many times over - it's a murder mystery, comedy, drama, romance, spectacle, that only just manages to be a little of them all. Kenneth Branagh, shows off as director and star (Hercule Poirot) and his big international cast probably had more fun than some audiences might - except those who don't expect a great deal from an over baked multimillion dollar production. The trailer too, looked impressive, but also sowed the seeds of apprehension about over promise. Maybe I expected too much but, it seems from an assortment of reviews, others also felt a little caught out - and to think, already, they are planning to remake more in this series. The end result is handsome looking foolishness - if that's all you want, then you may not mind. 
Heavy use of CGI offers several eye popping visual treats and it features a fairly good song over the end titles - sung, quite surprisingly well by Michelle Pfeiffer but, not a great deal else.",4,7,11,18 September 2018
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Another Award Winner...
","I've almost recovered from watching this but unfortunately have not yet cleansed it from my head. I also see so many other writers have made the comment that from here on, they will avoid movies the Academy serves large numbers of awards and seek out more rewarding entertainment offerings. I think perhaps they maybe right.Raymond Carver's short story (and stage play) has been adapted by Mexican director Inarritu (+ others) and transferred to the screen as an endless torture session for the unsuspecting viewer. Perhaps this is a product by or for those who were educated within consumer/conformist education systems, where 'art' is made up of: Campbell's soup posters, cheap copies of Marilyn and Elvis movie reproductions and Splash and Drip works that resemble a dogs dinner that's been spilt into a well used kitty litter tray. Now and then they come up with an exiting innovation but more often they add to each others downward spiral without even realizing it. Other movie goers, critics and judges also now belong to this school...so it perpetuates itself. Some see themselves as heading to be the new 'messiah's' of the creative arts. New? sorry, it's all been done before and perhaps maybe better.What ingredients seem to represent success today?...Lots of psycho angst, mixed with superhuman occultish powers - cleaver performers willing to over act on call, swear and blaspheme at every level of the story's weaker points (in a meagre attempt to add 'power'), mix in lashings of vulgar sexual taboos (not because they add anything to the story but because the film maker is no doubt getting off on it), then add somewhat pretentious camera work that leaves you lurching from one set piece to the next (can't blame the talented photographer Emmanuel Lubezki, he gives the director just what he called for). Keaton and Norton do well but their characters are too shallow to care for - is there really as much going down here as we're supposed to think? - Perhaps to those who like to analyze 'superficial' till it means 'substance', then this is a must. Beautiful British born Naomi Watts also works hard in an ill defined, ultimately unsatisfying role. There is a sequence where it looks like it may begin to work. This comes during a bar scene that brings 'Birdman' face to face with a famous critic (nicely played by Duncan) Here, there's an exchange of the better variety of discourse but it all falls over with the director reducing the critic to a caricature - obviously displaying his own contempt of critics. Another wasted opportunity. The music score (or lack of) is a money-saving percussive device that at first works, then becomes as tiresome as the rest of the movie. As for the end...don't even go there!. Seems when a movie can't be decently categorized they label it a 'satire' - but even good satire needs defining quality characteristics. Overall the final result is a disappointment. Then of course, you may just think it's terrific - Such is modern 'art' - Or, it could also be as the title suggests, requiring a large serve of 'ignorance'....",2,2,4,28 March 2016
Prometheus," Prometheus is Pretty Preposterous
","How to make a Si-Fi clone: First, re-cycle the script for Alien (which someone has already said, was really not much better than a 50's B movie anyway) then add a couple of ideas very similar to 2001, shuffle a few pages around - add one or two minor new thoughts to make it look as if it's somehow different. The result: Prometheus - a multi- million dollar effort that struggles to deliver. Pity the poor folk that paid good money to see it, thinking it might be special - only to come away wanting their money back.Next, add heaps of gore and repugnant CGI monsters - with tons of explosions and you have a movie for sci-fi addicted audiences the world over. But, from the look of so many user comments...most saw through this box office 'mix' of emptiness. I've always found Riddly Scott to be somewhat overrated but then, some are not that hard to please or just don't know the works that are being copied. Apart from a good looking intro/main title - accompanied by interesting musical orchestrations and a couple of good performances, the rest that rolls out is either old hat or scientifically ridiculous. If you like the predictable, or this director's 'style', you could be happy, otherwise, move on to something with substance.",Null,1,1,22 September 2017
The Queen," A New Apraisal Of 'The Queen'
","Had I not been given a DVD copy of this movie by a thoughtful friend, there's no way I'd have ever chosen to see it, and that would certainly have been my loss! While the script contains several 'suppositions' concerning aspects of the private lives of some very public dignitaries, this astounding production draws the viewer into a web of highly thought provoking situations.Were the royals right in their disgust of Diana's very 'out there' lifestyles? Was it Diana herself who was at fault or was it the relentless madness of a public fueled thirst for superficial publicity - ruthlessly dished up by a totally out of control, mostly soulless media. Seems they were/are all at fault within a shocking display of pride and moral selfishness. Given there are plenty of facts available and I don't usually approve of presumptive fiction, the screenplay by writer Peter Morgan is both intelligent and sensitive. It cleverly avoids judgmental dispersions that often accompany the writings of over zealous defenders of one side or the other, for this it has to be praised.This work also, unintentionally or otherwise, invites the viewer to consider the shift in ethical and personal character, that can be observed within the attitudes and behavior of generations who experienced the self sacrificing agony of war/as against those who matured during the post war boom and the emerging generations that followed. Growing up within a youthful population, these generations were heading for rebellion (some, regardless of validity or necessity)If looking back at the sensibilities that stimulated our developing psyche during these years, to a large degree, it consisted of a barrage of newly developed superficial type entertainments made for that 'new glow' in the lounge rooms of the modern home, TV. ~ A world wide proliferation of sensationalistic publications and art distributed by unscrupulous profiteers ~ We are now bombarded daily with relative mindlessness from an endless array of glossy magazines combined with all forms of sensation seeking news media (so many good people who dedicated their lives to helping others come and go with hardly a mention, yet a modern 'story book' princess brings nations to their knees) ~ There's no end of sus video 'games' and a plethora of so-called 'social' sites to also aid the promotion of a hedonistic 'it's all about me' attitude ~ Added to this volatile mix is a world of super slick, psychologically driven advertising that is constantly telling us we need products and services, we in fact, don't really need at all. The politically astute who have done a little research, will also be aware of other examples of this form of Social Engineering even within 'mainstream' cultural manipulations...these being derived from economically motivated 'agreements', set-up between various international government agencies, to elevate the value of essentially mediocre works to ridiculous heights. What emerges is an interesting study of who we have become, culturally and morally. For all the improvements we have brought to modern civilisation, much of it exists alongside an unforgivably suicidal dumbing down of our larger society. Director Stephen Frears maintains control all the way, keeping the story moving by avoiding any unnecessary padding that can all too often be associated with lesser productions of this type. With the story being set in places that would not be made available, the work of the production designer, art director and set decorators, becomes crucial to imparting the essential look of believability necessary for full audience involvement. Director of Photography, the award winning Brazillian Cinematographer Affonso Beato takes us on a not to be missed visual treat. Sumptuous indoor visions accompany outdoor aerials of grand proportions, truly eye popping! One special scene involving a magnificent 14 point Deer appearing in the same frame as a crying Queen Elizabeth is outstanding. This sequence also begs the viewer to consider several deeper meanings affecting all involved. Golden Globe wining music sound track composer, Alexandre Desplat adds generously to the unique emotional journey on offer in this splendid achievement. This should please all discerning viewers who enjoy first class movie making. The high quality 'Studio' DVD transfer I screened is first class. The cast of course, are uniformly superb.

Son of Saul," Son Of Saul - Unsettling, Difficult and Exhausting WW11 Holocaust Visitation
","It's not easy to write a critique for a movie of this type – on one hand, it's a brave attempt to portray the almost unbelievable of horrors that were perpetuated by a regime - claiming to be superior in all the arts - putting themselves above any other race - a race setting themselves up to be the most powerful nation on earth. Perhaps, it was this very pomposity that assured them of an ultimate fall from grace (as with the Romans). This movie however, is approached in such a claustrophobic photographic manner - with a tendency to imitate Kubrick. As with Kubrick's insistence on having overlong stylistic shots, where a camera would endlessly follow behind his subject in an attempt to pad out scenes with limited content. This technique when overused ultimately stretches the interest to snapping point. When will new movie makers stop imitating and form their own style - does everyone have to be the new Kubrick? The same technique eventually killed Kubrick's later works as he lost focus on his stories (that got weaker) to concentrate on their superficial 'style'.Hungarian writer/director Laszlo Nemes, has a penchant for horror and certainly crammed much of this into his nightmarish vision of life as an inmate, working in a Nazi death camp - hideously forced to witness and assist with the repugnant gassing murders of his own people. Maybe it would have been far more effective had he just got on with telling his shocking story in a time frame that held the audience's attention. As is, 'Saul' leaves the viewer exhausted, wanting to fast forward to a resolve and escape the unrelenting photographic style. Much of the story is good but treated in an inhibiting way, making it a questionable award winner - with 1hr 47mins being far too long for the restrictive treatment of its subject. Low budget movie makers use this hand-held camera technique because it's cheap but there's still a lot to be said for some involving conventional sweep!",Null,0,1,15 September 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," 150 Million Dollars Of ....
","Who are the target audience for this movie?. Might be difficult to find a description for certain groups (if any actually exist in the sober world). Should this film be lauded by the Academy with any awards other than the odd technical nod - then they could be doing themselves an injustice. It could be just another nail in the societies coffin, a pointing to it's being a consumers 'club' for self promotion. And then there's this talk of Direction, is this truly anymore than a big screen version of a CGI computer game?. A non-stop repetitive exercise in senseless blood letting, come chase-fest. The most honest (and intelligent) credit among an endless list, is the one requested by the D.T.I. It tellingly reads: 'Produced with the assistance of the Department Of Trade And Industry South Africa. Who Does Not Accept Any Liability For The Content, and Does Not Necessarily Support Such Content'! (they at least had the good sense to see the inherent danger...)Isis see the West (Africa and the full non Muslim World) as rubbish to be annihilated and this crude but expensive tosh sets out to prove it!. Problem is, it will 'entertain' them and convince them to continue their pursuit (don't kid yourself it won't). This probably brings us to another target audience: Bikie gangs and hoodlums of every persuasion. Movie makers seem to pander to every want of the world's thugs (yes, even the sophisticated variety) knowing they will invest in tickets (and more) for the cause. Enter yet another very likely target group, the Ice Crazies, addicted to non-stop grotesque computer games (try working in a physiologist's clinic or hospital these days!) This ugly, moronic outing helps signify the end of intelligent 'entertainment' and hints 'Mr Miller' could be reaching that stage all once were good movie makers come to and sadly don't see the writing on the wall till it all falls over. George once helped audiences grow up, now it's all for the quick buck. Yes, you will make money from those that go because of the hype and noisy violence, but take a close look at the follow up 'word of mouth'. So many most revealing reviews posted from the folk that matter most, the audience. Seems a sad fall from the grace that was once yours....PS: Loved the review from the viewer who wrote words to the effect: 'If this is where award winning movie making is going, then stop the world I want to get off!

The Pursuit of Happyness," Pursuing Happiness - Never Easy
","What do some people want? Here we have a story based on fact (Chris Gardner's year long battle living on the streets). With multiple escalating situations that left me simultaneously challenged, exhausted, and in wonder - yet still some critics label it mealy a 'feel good' movie! Obviously these folk have never had to drag their child and worldly belongings around the streets or sleep in public 'shist' houses - while dodging every conceivable trial that life could throw at them! What were they watching (or thinking) I ask? It's so easy for some writers with little or no imagination, to sit in a cozy Cinema or on their easy chair in the comfort of their own space and never know the cold hard difference. This movie offers class in all departments of cinema: Pathos, Drama, Humour, Social-comment, Family, Work-ethic, Commitment, in fact, just about all areas of human ethical endurance and determination. And, it's all served up with great cinematography, direction, editing and music - capped off with performances to knock you out! How Will Smith (and son) did not get the Academy that year either speaks volumes or the competition must have been awesome indeed! Worthy on many levels and should not to be missed.",9,0,0,22 April 2017
The Soloist," Fascinating Real Life Study
","Interesting based on fact film directed by dyslexic British filmmaker Joe Wright. Wright seems like an odd choice for this film considering his success with high caliber romantic and literary movies like 'Pride and Prejudice' '05 ~ 'Atonement' 07 ~ and 'Anna Karenina' '012. Perhaps, the at times uneven style of 'The Soloist' harks back to Wright's earlier days as a Video clip director but might also be partly due to Susannah Grant's screenplay. Somewhere between the two, this production has a couple of seemingly disjointed scenes that to some, could seem misplaced. The story is a powerful one, with Jammie Foxx perfectly cast playing the mentally afflicted and volatile Cello prodigy Nathaniel Ayers. Ayers, while living on the mean streets of Los Angeles playing broken down instruments, attracts the interest of L.A. Times columnist Steve Lopez - Robert Downey Jr delivers one of his more sincere performances as Lopez. Foxx, who has been known for having some difficulty working with cast members on other projects, works hard at this difficult role and impresses.Italian composer Dario Marianelli is at home with his work on several Beethoven and Bach classics and Irish director of photography Seamus McGarvey (The Hours '02) together with his director delivers a mix of pop art and dramatic images.This is thoughtful film making that offers many inspirational moments - it's strength lies in it's fact based and tormented subject. Recommended viewing and definitely one that has much to offer a wider audience - as well as its insight into the care of the mentally unstable and the impact they bring to family and friends.",8,0,0,22 September 2016
The Martian," Don't Go Anywhere Matt We're Comin back ta Get Ya....
","Are you ready for a feel good movie about being left to die on Mars - well 'The Matian' could be it! (could be a couple of spoilers if there's anyone left who has not already seen this one). This offers all the fun of being left out in the frozen night - then waking up next morning totally ALONE on Mars. Our astronaut (Matt Damon) has been speared in the gut and surviving in a space suit that has a hole punched in it. After some initial grueling pain we surprisingly find Matt doesn't really seem to mind all that much.Nice images, good locations, some good original score music (in between the compulsory hit-parade-chart-toppers designed for the sales promo sound-track album), then along come those assorted characters from the central casting stereo-types catalog - you know them all from just about every other big budget crowd pleaser over the past 25 years. The stony, super cool NASA chief ~ super smart female space craft commanders who show little fear or sign of human concern - simply reduced to 'gung ho' utterings like: 'OK lets go get our boy'! ~ Chinese scientists willing to give away billions of dollars and years of 'Top Secret' equipment and information - all just to get a nice outcome for this lone U.S. astronaut ~ understanding wives and children who smilingly wish their life partners well - after being told they've voted to put their lives on the line for a one in a thousand mission. Not enough for you? - there are many others to be found but go see for yourself.It's beginning to seem like NASA is being reduced to product placement in space. Even the the 55yr old poorly named: 'Robinson Caruso On Mars' fared a little better in the human psychological stakes. 'The Martian' is really just another typical Ridley Scott movie so if you enjoy those, then none of the above will concern you - now I understand why it ended up on general cable less than a year after its Cinema release. While some of its two hrs plus is watchable, those that are lovers of fantastic big budget space adventures will actually enjoy it all but, if that's not you - then blast off with caution...oh, further warning: you may also need to dodge all those awards that were thrown at this offering.",4,1,4,25 July 2016
Law Abiding Citizen," Law Abiding Citizen - Don't Abide It
","Here it is, 'Death Wish 139'! The same ole over-the-top violence (but let's see how much more repugnant nastiness can be crammed into it). From an opening featuring a difficult to watch home invasion and brutal rape/murder - what follows, at times, looks as if it might be heading towards making a statement about a miscarriage of the justice system but, that's as close as it gets. From here, to the ridiculous finish all we are given is totally farfetched foolishness that defies all logic and insults the viewers intelligence. We have the sole survivor of his family's murder unbelievably manipulating the prison system so he can metre out impossible revenge on all who took part on both sides of the law. If that sounds good to you and you are willing to let all semblance of intelligence plunge you into a mental void then you might last to the moronic finale. The audience manipulation begins with the main criminal being written as nastier than the nastiest - just so you will feel good about their hideous death and continues through to those who carry the law to their graves via impossible executions etc. That this slickly produced and acted movie made any money at all is testimony to just how easy it is to fool way too many members of the public. Empire reviewer; Angie Errigo sums it up perfectly. With other IMDb poster; Chromium Five, giving a humorous but bitingly fitting summary. Others simply rave on about this nonsense foolishly.",Null,0,0,8 May 2018
Atonement," Atonement May Have Something To Atone For
","Stylish visuals, smart performances, neat direction, excellent classy Music score, 'Atonement' has it all but, what about the writing? According to the Academy and certain critics, this is class stuff â€“ yet looking at a very large quantity of the viewer's comments, it seems they were more readily able to see the lack of believable story elements and situations contained within. Not many likable characters to help you connect with these, at times, one dimensional folk - who live their lives more like a group of yr 2000 HBO yuppie types - than the 1930s personalities they're supposed to be portraying. This good looking movie with its interesting title - tends yet again to prove that the current folk who make up our movie analyzers and judges of award worthy product, might be sadly lacking any practical understanding of decent writing. Don't look too hard at the details within this work or you may find yourself questioning the wisdom of the somewhat, over-the-top raves dished out to this, 'could have been' but, 'sadly is not' such a good story. There are some moments of high emotional impact during the latter half's war years and the performers play it all for real but, overall this ends up being for the easily pleased or lovers of big glossy productions, with more set dressing than real character or attention to fine details.",5,0,1,6 September 2017
