Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It was wonderful. loved the special effects, with the technology we have today.. it was an awesome movie!
","I am a grandmother of 8, and a long time fan. We took our  23 year old son. It was worth waiting for. I sat with tears flowing as it started. Truly awesome special effects. Its great to be able to see the powers of the jedi..  that George Lucas was not able to show till now. I know my son living in Norway is eager to see it as well. It is sad they have to wait so long to see it. He is counting the days .. as we were to see this magnificent  movie. I am looking forward to Episodes 2 and 3.. can`t wait.. If you have not seen it yet. do so.. I have seen it twice.. and will go again soon.. and again...",9,0,0,27 May 1999
