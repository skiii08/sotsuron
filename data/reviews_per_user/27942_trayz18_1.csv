Resident Evil: Afterlife," Worth Seeing In 3D!!!
","Well!!! Most big budget movies these days are using 3D technology to trick people into forgetting about the story and focus on the effects. Although I absolutely love the effects in this film, the story could do with a lot more work in terms of the characters, but let's face it, we watch these kind of films purely for the action, which is what you get from Afterlife.Milla Jovovich is back as Alice in this fourth installment in the Resident Evil series. Milla does a great job as a feminine gun totting action hero.The story centers around Alice (Milla) trying to find other humans, which she eventually finds locked within a prison surrounded by zillions of zombies. Most of the characters in this film are present just for the zombies to chow down on which isn't a spoiler for anyone ( I hope). There really isn't much else to say about the story without spoiling it.Afterlife is definitely worth seeing in 3D, this is proved within the first 10 minutes of the film. The director Paul W.S. Anderson wrote and directed this film, so kudos to him for not making a complete mess of the film. His wife Milla is what sells this film in my opinion, she's a natural when it comes to action films because of her on-screen presence.The film doesn't follow truthfully to the video game its based off of, these Resident Evil films are more like adaptations of the video game franchise. The problem i had with this film was the character called Wesker. In the video game he kicks major ass but in this movie he does do a bit of ass-kicking but not efficiently like in the game. Only people who have played Resident Evil games would know exactly what I'm talking about.Resident Evil Afterlife is a leap forward from the previous Resident Evil Extinction, definitely recommend anyone to watch it in 3D because of the high quality effects which is to be expected from a $60 million budget film. Honestly though this film didn't need the 3D effects to sell it, but it definitely is a well appreciated option to watch the film.",7,5,12,12 September 2010
