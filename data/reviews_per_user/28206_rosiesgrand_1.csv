First Man," Boring
","This film could/should have been interesting and exciting. It was neither. The attempt to be very intense and maybe (given a revealing tragedy) intimate (?) failed. Amazingly the production and presentation were high quality, as was the acting. But the low key, slow storytelling just made it boring.",2,5,8,25 January 2019
