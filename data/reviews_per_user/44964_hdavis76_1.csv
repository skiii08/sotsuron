The Blair Witch Project," Disturbing and Inventive
","Blair Witch is one of those movies that people will be talking about for years to come.  The movie doesn't rely on blood, gore, or surprising shock scenes (which have become over used in most horror movies), but on a building sense of terror that is never released until the very end.  We are also never given any easy answers about what is happening.  We know exactly what the students know, which is really very little.  My only complaint is that the camera work was so jumpy at times that it made it hard to focus on the screen.  However, this is just me being very picky.  Overall, it was a great movie that I would recommend to any fan of horror movies.",8,1,1,2 August 1999
