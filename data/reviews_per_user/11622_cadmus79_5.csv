Gremlins," Terrific little gem.
","One of the best subversive little 'comedies' of the 80's, this film not only has the malevolent little critters themselves, but also the great Phoebe Cates as the ingenue, in her best work since Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Fun, silly, and strange, this is what a David Lynch film would look like if he had gone to USC film school. That's sort of a compliment, sort of a dig, :) Anyway, this is a fun one for the whole family, especially if you're babysitting. Rent it at night, you won't regret it!",2,1,17,18 June 2001
The Godfather: Part II," The best sequel ever made.
","In fact, it's more than just a 'sequel'- it stands on it's own as a masterpiece of film making. Al Pacino is at his best, as is Mr. Coppola and his team of camera people and musicians and actors. Everyone in it shines, particularly the remainder of the Corleone family. I won't go into plot, I'll just praise it to high heaven and hope that if you haven't seen this, you'll buy the DVD TONIGHT to check it out. Amazing.",10,2,3,19 June 2001
Pearl Harbor," Nice planes, shame about the script.
","And the acting and the bombastic music and the length and just about everything else. We were all promised this would be the summer blockbuster! Why wasn't it? BECAUSE IT'S BAD, that's why. I hope they go to see it in Europe, they'll see anything I guess the subtitles will make it better, you won't have to watch the wooden acting. I liked the bombing part, the special effects. But overall, I'd say wait till it comes out on video and get a bunch of bored people together and rent it, that way you won't really have to watch it until someone says 'Oh here comes the bombs!' and then you can all gather around the set.",1,0,0,18 June 2001
Singin' in the Rain," THE great movie musical of all time.
","This is the one that they will all be compared to. Incomparable camera and acting, beautiful music, funny, touching, silly, this movie sets the standard for all musicals before or since. Nothing comes close, in my opinion. The plot, such as it is, is about a bunch of kids 'putting on a show!' during the birth of talkies, and of course two of them fall in love. Gene Kelly is a genius, as is Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor. Rent it! Watch it! You'll love it too!",10,1,4,19 June 2001
Shrek," One of the best of the year.
","Watch out Disney, SHREK is taking over your territory and you are quickly sinking into bland silly musicals. This film is clever and smart and has a wonderful message that is not obvious. It's fun and irreverant and anything BUT 'politically correct', and I loved every cotton pickin minute of it, so did my whole family. We saw it twice in the last few weeks, so relieved to see something that is not pretentious but fun and smart. Go and see this film, you won't regret it!!          ..",1,3,11,15 June 2001
