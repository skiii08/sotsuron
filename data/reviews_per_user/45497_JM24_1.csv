The Blair Witch Project," A superb film that blends the human spirit with good old-fashioned horror
","The Blair Witch Project creates a unique blend of the terrifying with the unknown.  The audience is enticed to become part of the film-maker's world, to laugh along with the characters, to wonder what led to this, and almost to run in pure horror of the thing hunting them down. It is obvious as the film progresses that the 3 are losing their heads, their very personalities working against them, their egos and self-pride dissolving as hopelessness sets in, their mind becoming that of an alone and fearful animal.  They forget about their tedious social lives, instead the only thing that matters is finding their way out of a world they no longer have control of.The Blair Witch project is not about the Blair Witch.  It is about what can happen when humans are no longer the dominating force, and consequently what happens to the person's mind that is subjected to this horror.  All of this build-up leads to an ending that not only is absolutely terrifying, but also leaves a huge mystery, a void that only the viewer can fill.",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
