Come and See," The title invites you to Come and See
","This movie invites you to see, or witness the atrocities of WWll. The story is about a young boy named Floyra who witnesses the events that happened in villages in Russia. The young boy comes of age in a very hell-like way. He witnesses many, or all of the things that happened in the war. He returns to his village after being taken to be part of a resistance and finds nothing there. Throughout the film, he stares at the camera inviting you to keep watching; an invitation that everyone takes but doesn't like. Personally, I felt very disturbed by all of the events that the young boy goes through. His face is one that is not easily forgotten. His lips are dry, his eyes look dead. The last scene shows news reels of the Nazi troops and people cheering and Hitler; all going backwards. That scene alone makes you wonder how could people allow something like that happen and how could a little boy grow up to massacre so many people?",9,3,4,17 December 2007
