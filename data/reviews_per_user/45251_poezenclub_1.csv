The Lobster," Pretentious and toe curling
","The high praise for this movie on Rotten Tomatoes and also on IMDb made me make an account here. I have never disagreed more and quite frankly do not understand at all why the critics do not see how pretentious and awful this movie is. The actors are OK, but the film is a disaster. It starts out looking very art-house, with very slow story line and everybody looking artsy, but as it goes along the story becomes so utterly ridiculous and sickening without any purpose other than to be ridiculous and sickening that the movie really just turns into an empty shell, a pretentious 'how weird and shocking can we be' sort of thing. It wants to be art-house so bad it screams it at you. Overkill. The entire movie I wondered who had managed to convince the actors this was a good job to take on. Maybe I am looking at this from a European perspective? Maybe American cinema is lost in between Hollywood and a place they don't know where it is anymore. Art for art's sake can be good, but you can really fail if you overdo it. Maybe we can invent a new term for it: desperate cinema. Desperate to be special.",1,58,93,2 August 2016
