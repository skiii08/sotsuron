Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," *Sigh*
","Alright, one of the few good things that I can say about Episode I is that George stuck to the basics. No sex scenes, no graphic violence, and no strong language. Other than that, I felt like I sat through a movie that was geared more toward my five-year-old nephew that a lifelong Star Wars fan like myself. The title should have been something like 'Episode I: Yay! Star Wars for the Barely Potty Trained!' Don't get me wrong, I did watch the whole movie, have even watched it again when I caught it on HBO at three in the morning. It had great special effects. And wee Anakin is just adorable. But it just did NOT have the same sparkle as the original trilogy. As a die-hard Star Wars dork, I just have to give it a thumbs down. *sigh*",Null,1,2,18 January 2007
Hostel," Um...scary?
","Why, oh why are there no good horror movies being made anymore? Did we use up all of our collective creativity inventing the Segway? Hooray for the gore and all, (although Dr. Giggles has it beaten in that department) but this movie has the weakest plot line ever, the special effects really weren't that great, and the 'acting' was on level with a kindergarten graduation skit. Not once did I wonder 'Whodunit?', there was no slow buildup of tension or fear, no in-depth character encounters, just 94 minutes of mind-numbing, IQ-draining nonsense. I realize that there will never be another Shining, Exorcist, or Rosemary's Baby, and maybe those standards are unfairly high, but surely filmmakers who probably make more money than god should at least try to EARN some of it.",Null,1,3,18 January 2007
