The Avengers," A Mega-Blockbuster Conglomeration of Marvel Superheroes!
","The Avengers is a clean-burning, six-cylinder entertainment - a wall-to-wall action bonanza, executed with a fluid coherence. It laughs in the face of expectation and instead sets its own bar that all blockbusters need to follow.Following on from the first Thor flick, the demi-god's evil brother Loki (a deliciously fiendish Tom Hiddleston) is intent on subjugating humanity with the help of an all-powerful energy cube that'll allow him to bring his alien armies to Earth. Trouble starts when this glowing cube of untold power called the Tesseract is appropriated by Loki, who with a nudge from his magic assegai brain-zaps a snap marksman Hawkeye (a competent Jeremy Renner) and a top scientist into his evil scheme of world domination. All that stands in his way is Nick Fury (the ever reliable Samuel Jackson), the head of the covert peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D. who sets about uniting the world's superheroes to avert the threat, rounding up our titular team - Iron Man (a hilarious Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (a subversively charming Mark Ruffalo), Thor (the charismatic Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (a sincere turn by Chris Evans) and Black Widow (the sexy but earnest Scarlett Johansson) – hoping they will be greater than the sum of their parts. Problem is, they're a dysfunctional outfit, with differences of opinion and troubled pasts, and one of them is a gigantic, green loose cannon. Now, with a global catastrophe looming, they must subsume individual will to the collective good. But Loki isn't called 'the god of mischief' for nothing! Before Fury's new super team can find its balance, Loki is in their heads sowing seeds of doubt, distrust, anger and conflict. Can earth's mightiest heroes put their differences aside in time to protect the planet – or is their coming together an even bigger threat than Loki himself?The Avengers doesn't buckle under the weight of its gargantuan expectations and overflowing cast, largely because of Joss Whedon. He weaves all of the powder-keg moments into a story that is meaningful and always makes sense. The point in The Avengers is to bring six separate characters together as a team without sacrificing their individuality and by extension their value as solo franchises and Whedon does an excellent job of keeping the disparate personalities of his protagonists in play. Whedon's script sparks up the exposition with some sparkling dialogue, high stakes and balls- to-the-wall action spectacle. If you don't believe me, check out the thrilling alien-bashing finale on the streets of Manhattan - it is a pure fan boy wet-dream. Smart, funny, pulsating and surprisingly cathartic, Joss Whedon succeeds in appeasing its core fanbase. From ambition to scale to the way it justly balances each remarkable character, The Avengers is utterly stimulating, satisfyingly scripted and damn right faultless big screen entertainment. The Avengers make us do something increasingly rare in these over-franchised times - root for a sequel. Go smash!",10,8,12,21 April 2015
Black Swan," A Slow Creep Into Insanity - Touching and Terrifying in Equal Measure!
","Darren Aronofsky's obsession with obsession continues in Black Swan - a twisted psychological drama bordering on horror that turns ballet into a dangerous mind game. Here, he explores the quest for perfection in what is a near-perfect film!This arty thrill ride of a movie has a story mirroring that of 'Swan Lake', the venerable ballet at the heart of the action. It follows coy ballerina Nina Sayers (Portman), who is made the prime ballerina for the upcoming performance of Swan Lake, replacing the previous principal dancer Beth (Ryder), much to the delight of her domineering mother Erica (Hershey). To play the lead in Swan Lake, Nina must embrace her Black Swan - the sinister, unbridled yin to her white and fluffy yang. Pummeled under the barbaric tutelage of her director Tomas (Cassell), Nina begins an inexorable descent into madness. While Nina successfully embodies the innocent, delicate spirit of the White Swan she struggles with the opposite persona of the Black Swan, a more dark and sexual being. As a result she is pushed into competition with Lily (Kunis), a new dancer, who has the ability to capture the darker side of the ballet. In her unending quest for perfection, Nina takes 'losing herself' to a whole new level, living in a spinning vortex of fear and unreality. The intensity builds as opening night draws near, Nina's grip on reality becoming more tenuous by the day, and reaches a fever pitch during the first performance of 'Swan Lake', the movie's themes crystallizing into a beautiful, gut-wrenching climax.Natalie Portman is phenomenal as Nina - it's a virtuoso performance of hard graft. She inhabits the role with gusto, making Nina a superb balance of mothered restraint, desperation, repression and wide-eyed innocence, all masking a caged animal keen to break free - an incredibly raw and gutsy display of her talent. Adding to the film's gravitas are the superb performances from the supporting cast. All of the actors, from the ever watchable Vincent Cassel (as the ballet's sleazy director) to the controlled Mila Kunis (as a dancer as free-spirited as Nina is repressed) to wonderfully monstrous Barbara Hershey (as Nina's overbearing stage mom) to a briefly but effectively used Winona Ryder (as the ballet company's fallen queen bee) are splendid.But the big star here is unquestionably Aronofsky, whose singular vision quite literally stuns one silent. This film finds the director reverting to his truer, untamed filmmaking self, giving in to his unhinged artistic impulses. It's that quality that gives the film so much more resonance than most thrillers; ironically what makes the film so effective in painting a vividly unsettling picture of losing control is Aronofsky's complete mastery of his material. The slow burn air of unease is established from frame one and carefully, creepily crescendos until finally exploding into a stunningly intense final act - the ultimate cinematic culmination of the film's dualities of focus and surrender, liberation and destruction, and most of all, beauty and horror.Black Swan has a pulse, a feeling of agitated, intoxicating brilliance. Part thriller, part horror and part trippy exploration of the clash between reality and livid vision, Black Swan is a balls-to-the-wall display of cinematic showmanship.",9,1,3,19 April 2015
Changeling," Changes the Face of the Crime-Drama Genre!
","Changeling, a riveting true crime story set in Los Angeles in 1928, is proof of Clint Eastwood's sure touch and emotional acuity as a director on powerful display. It's a mesmerizing human drama that pulls us in, to the haunting strains of Eastwood's resonant score.9 year old Walter Collins disappears from their suburban home while Christine is out working at a telephone company. The LAPD does a rather sloppy job with the investigation. Five months later, when the trail has gone cold, Christine finally gets word that Walter has been found. In a taut scene later, LAPD stages a massive press conference in order to generate good press for the embattled police department, which has fought allegations of corruption and brutality.but Christine threatens to rain on their parade when she points out that the boy (Devon Conti) is not her son. With that revelation, the film veers into spooky, almost surreal territory. As Changeling gathers momentum and shifts tone, it retains a unifying quality, a bleak and melancholy air that sustains it through its transformations. Clint Eastwood, at the peak of his artful powers, adds to his already impressive body of directorial accomplishments with Changeling - a sordid tale of the abuses of power, a gripping mystery and a shrewd historical period piece which documents several concurring events which changed the landscape of Prohibition era Los Angeles. He tightens the screws of suspense without ever forgetting where the heart of his film lies. Lesser hands might let the story sink into teary sentiment.Yet the real draw here is Angelina Jolie. Not only does she dazzle visually with her unique features heightened with pale complexion and red lipstick, but Jolie provides an emotionally breathtaking performance. She plays Christine Collins like a gathering storm, moving from terror to a fierce resolve. The trauma she suffers is almost tangible as it pours off the screen. View the scene where she confronts the impostor posing as her son; tremble at her throaty scream; feel the pain and anguish. She evokes every parent's worst nightmare, and provides a career defining performance while doing so. All in all, it is a devastatingly poignant story, beautifully told by a filmmaker right at the top of his game. A failure that's more involving than most successes!",9,2,4,22 March 2015
Requiem for a Dream," More A Nightmare than A Dream, 'Requiem for a Dream' is An Addiction In Itself!
","'Requiem for a Dream' - What an inappropriately dozy title for such an explosive film! Darren Aronofsky's nerve-corroding adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel depicts drug abuse's annihilative properties using a sobering sensory blitzkrieg. It takes four relatively happy and balanced individuals and it watches almost clinically as each one messes up his existence through addiction.Set in Brooklyn, we first meet the characters when Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) comes round to his mother Sara's (Ellen Burstyn) for his regular habit of pawning her belongings in order to buy drugs. Swiftly afterwards, we meet the other two main characters: Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend Tyrone (a barely recognizable Marlon Wayans). The movie then follows its inspired three-act structure of 'Summer', 'Fall' and 'Winter', as the characters chase their various dreams and obsessions. Harry, Marion and Tyrone are all hooked on drugs and they dream of being 'on Easy Street' – to that end, they conceive a plan to buy, cut and sell heroin, but they soon get a little too fond of their own product. Sara, meanwhile, is also addicted, to her daily routine of coffee and television, specifically a show that is part infomercial, part game-show. So when she gets a routine junk-mail call that appears to promise her a place as a contestant, she starts to obsess about fitting into an old red dress, and becomes hooked on amphetamines as a result. Visions of luxury become inescapable nightmares of insatiable itches — to be thin, rich, applauded, feared. Requiem for a Dream glamorizes nothing en route to a near-nauseating finale. As the absence of 'Spring' in the chapter titles hints, it's a near-operatic descent into hell for all concerned! Darren Aronofsky is a visceral film-maker, and here he pulls out all the stops to create a truly hypnotic experience. He repeatedly shows us the various junkie 'routines' of cooking, shooting up, or of making coffee and popping pills, shot in close-up and edited together rapidly. When added to Clint Mansell's aching, agonizing score that crescendos to audible reckoning, this has the intended effect of conveying the sudden rush the characters are experiencing, as indicated by the repeated shots of dilating eyeballs that end each montage.As his four ill-fated characters, Mr. Aronofsky assembles an unexpectedly strong cast. Both Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans give commendable performances. Jennifer Connelly imbues her character with vulnerability and sexuality even as she stares pale-faced into the bathroom mirror desperate for a fix. As for Ellen Burstyn, she's brutal to watch. You really see her deteriorate before your eyes, going from Mommy dearest to that whacked out old hag raving in the subway. Burstyn gets thin, then thinner, her hair dye gets uglier and uglier, her make-up messier, always more obsessed with her game show and her stupid red dress. The actress manages to trace a frighteningly real portrait of emergent obsession fueled by loneliness, sadness and vanity.Yes, visually this is an exhilarating, unique film. But it is also a singularly difficult and challenging film to watch. More a nightmare than a dream, Requiem for a Dream becomes an addiction in itself.",9,1,2,17 December 2015
Captain Phillips," Paul Greengrass is Without a Doubt The 'Captain' of This Ship!
","'Captain Phillips' opens in Underhill, Vermont, as our titular Captain Richard Phillips prepares to depart for Africa, bemoaning the elevated levels of competition that force him to take ever more dangerous assignments. He is the pragmatic captain of the Maersk Alabama, a freight ship tasked with transporting materials across Somalian waters. Cut to a beach in Somalia, where we are immediately engaged in a more cutthroat form of job competition, as penniless men offer meager bribes to gain employment as pirates. Here, we meet Muse, a violently ambitious pirate, who is seen as low on the totem pole of an assemblage of money-hungry pirates until he overpowers one of them physically, and then assumes leadership of the group. They observe ships on the water like hyenas waiting for one to wander from the herd, and when the Alabama's course takes it away from the primary formation, they seize an opportunity to pursue – and then capture – the ship for purposes of thievery. Phillips' attempt to prevent the hijacking is a failure, and four pirates, including Muse, manage to get on board with heavy artillery. And from that point of time, it's a splendidly mounted, nerve-racking thrill ride, building to an almost unbearably tense climax.Captain Phillips is a prime example of Hollywood's unrivaled ability to rapidly reprocess a story from headline to marquee. Captain Phillips' aesthetic is vintage Paul Greengrass: cinema of the moment with a festering voyeurism so insular it barely seems to exist beyond the boundaries of the frame. He brilliantly employs his punishing brand of verisimilitude to immerse the audience in a situation that many wouldn't want to experience even vicariously. The script, adapted from the book written by the actual protagonist, is not romanticized or glossed over with overreaching sentiment, and Greengrass' direction matches it with a style that is consistently tenacious. From the first shot to the last, you feel that tremendous security you get when you are sure that the filmmaker is in total control of his material, as he mixes gritty realism with some stirring military ops for an edge of the seat piracy thriller.The movie is anchored by performances as easily as it is by narrative details. The shy and unassuming Barkhad Abdi, steps into the role of Muse with sublime exactitude, and his eyes occupy a quality that suggests he isn't simply reciting dialogue; it's as if he believes he is participating in the conflict. Tom Hanks gives Captain Phillips a thoroughly human portrayal, convincing us how an ordinary man does extraordinary things in the face of death. He puts every ounce of his charm to good use but digs deep into a character with such raw and emotional fervency that there is little hint of us consciously accepting it as a mere performance.Captain Phillips is a gripping, grueling, agonizing, brutalizing, kick-punching motion picture, but beyond the technical thrills and vise-grip tension, it also is a dynamite lesson of the human psyche.",9,0,2,8 February 2016
United 93," 'United' They Stood, in Paul Greengrass' Astounding Docu-Drama!
","11th September, 2001. United 93 should have been a routine flight from Newark to San Francisco with 44 people on board. Of course, shortly after takeoff, the passengers on the plane, and later, the world, learned that what happened that day was anything but routine. 4 of the 44 passengers that boarded the flight were extremist terrorists who were out to hijack the flight with a view to crash it into the Capitol Building in Washington D.C. As two planes crash into the World Trade Center and another into the Pentagon, the citizens on board United 93 are left to decide whether to sit tight or try to take back the plane.Taking no prisoners in the fictional sense, writer-director Paul Greengrass comes as close to uncovering what might have happened in the only hijacked plane not to hit its target on 9/11. By not wrapping it up in the American flag, demonizing the evildoers, canonizing the heroes, or focusing on their tearful telephone farewells to family and friends, Greengrass makes United 93 a gut-wrenching example of ordeal cinema. For it telescopes tightly on the tragedy, not as a rallying cry for the war on terror, but from the plausible perspective of 40, otherwise ordinary people simply responding to the shocking realization that their jet has just been hijacked. He doesn't pad the action with neat little back stories; we know no more about the passengers than they knew about each other on the last day of their lives. Using a hand-held camera, he crowds the screen with the essential gut rush of panic and confusion, whether in the plane or at the air traffic control centre, where many of the men who were there on the day play themselves.The result is an astoundingly intense pressure-cooker docudrama which plays out - horribly - in almost real-time. With its nigh-on unbearable attention to mundane detail, this is reality that bites like a pit-bull; we watch as the passengers prepare to board at Gate 17, making final cellphone calls, politely avoiding eye-contact, small-talking in the hushed tones of the mildly tense air-commuter - all alongside the men who will ultimately kill them - and the feel of dread is so palpable as to make us nauseous.United 93 does not offer the political or analytical dimension to the situationist spectacle Al-Qaida gave to the world that dwarfed anything from the conventional workshops of politics and culture. The movie just lives inside that stunned, astonished 90 minutes of horror between one epoch and the next. But in doing so, Paul Greengrass creates a blazingly powerful and magnificent memorial to the passengers of that doomed flight. A chillingly profound profile in courage of forty strangers who bonded under incomprehensible circumstances to face an unspeakable evil!",9,0,0,8 September 2015
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is A Classic For The Ages!
","E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Steven Spielberg's timeless ode to all the loners of the world, finds him at his most pure. The storyline of E.T. is a relatively simple one: Ten-year-old Elliott (Henry Thomas, who never resorts to that 'oh-look-at-how-precious-I-am' shtick but makes you root for him through his incredible performance), who lives with his mom and two siblings, meets a wizened little geezer who turns out to be a visitor from another planet. E.T., owing to his overtly curious streak, is abandoned by his pot-bellied otherworldly pals as he misses his ride back home. He now has to cope on Earth until they can come back and rescue him. Being a friendly extraterrestrial ambassador, Elliott and E.T. soon form a special bond and Elliott, with help from his siblings, helps E.T. find a way home. And soon the magic unfolds! Along the way there are moments of humor as E.T. makes discoveries about this world and the children learn things about him; moments of sadness when E.T. becomes deathly ill and is captured by the scientists; and a thrilling chase sequence that will have you cheering along. When Elliott and his friends soar on their bicycles against a gigantic moon, it's as touching and note-perfect a moment as any in the movies. Spielberg's 'lovable-space-creature-slums-it-in-suburbia' movie is one of the greatest achievements in imagination ever put on film. The simplicity of the narrative and the ingeniousness of the E.T. character create a powerful combination. The genius and wonder of E.T. is that Spielberg creates a character that is obviously not real. However, he draws the audience in so well that you care for him as much as you do for the children. What the movie does so well is to capture that moment in life when childhood seems to be slipping away. This is a wondrous evocation of that time in our lives when brothers and sisters were necessary co-conspirators, bikes were our ticket to freedom and we were willing to believe that a friendly little alien could really appear from the backyard shed. While doing so, Spielberg manages not only to entertain young children but also reach out to the child in all of us, never failing to strum the heartstrings. Many have hailed E.T. as a bona-fide sci-fi classic. For me, it is a heart and soul movie that just happens to have a sci-fi angle. And you know what? You're sure going to need a box of tissues!",9,7,9,21 April 2015
Minority Report," Those Who Do Not Find Spielberg's Dystopian Universe Hypnotic, Are Surely in the 'Minority'!
","The year is 2054 and Washington DC is the host of a nervy experiment in crime prevention. Deep in the Pre-Crime agency lie the 'pre-cogs' - three psychics who dangle in liquid suspension, sharing their incriminating visions with the police. Devised by retired law enforcement officer Lamar Burgess (a brilliant Max von Sydow), the system uses the talents of these pre-cogs with exceptional psychic abilities who are kept in a constant state of dream sleep by a combination of mind-numbing drugs, partial immersion in a huge sensory-deprivation tank, and electronic 'halos' attached to their heads. Using the fragmented images seen by them, which are projected onto a screen, the agency is able to predict and prevent every murder that is about to happen in the city, deftly stepping in and arresting the suspect before the crime has even been committed, to let him rot in a suspended-animation prison. With no homicides in six years, it's a flawless system headed by a perfect guardian, Chief John Anderton (a riveting act by Tom Cruise). Motored by the death of his son, his Pavlovian impulse is to slam the lid on any homicide before it happens. A nifty prologue shows the system's ruthless efficiency, but the arrival of a rival detective Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell, all growl and snap) sets into motion an unbreakable chain of events that sees Anderton on the run from the very system he championed. Pre-cog Agatha (Samantha Morton, in an alternately touching and haunting performance) has marked him for murder and there's just 36 hours before his date with his secret victim. It's a set-up all right. But who's pulling the strings?From the description alone, Minority Report may appear to be wholly outrageous and borderline unbelievable. This being a work based on a story by Philip K Dick, wacko embellishments are a given, and with its singing cereal packets, vertical freeways, virtual shopkeepers and simulated reality parlors that make your wildest wish come true, Minority Report's world - a surreal cityscape of opulent chromes and 1940s grub - makes for an extraordinary spectacle, made all the creepier by a parched and seedy color palette. If the universe is fully immersive, so is the plot thanks to a screenplay which is hardboiled but never scrambled and the dialogue which is sour and smart-mouthed.But above all, Minority Report works because of its director Steven Spielberg, who deftly juggles an intricate plot. The storyline allows him ample room to accent and detail - and no one is better at building a fictional reality than Mr. Blockbuster. Although this film is nearly three hours long, it is constantly exhilarating, either from the standpoint of its futuristic vision or its tense plot line. Spielberg packs the frame with reminders of humanity trudging along despite the bleakness of its surroundings, delivering a product which is well-rendered, technically and emotionally, as the subtler moments resonate with real sentiment and insight.Minority Report is not just some fairy tale gussied up with hi-tech cars and cool costumes and called science-fiction. It is a science-fiction story that actually dares to be 'Science'- 'Fiction' – a gripping whodunit and a murky future-noir with style to spare!",9,1,2,11 October 2015
Kung Fu Panda," This 'Panda-monium' is Music to The Ears!
","In Kung Fu Panda, Jack Black provides the voice of Po, a portly panda who joylessly serves noodles in his father's shop. Po is a self-effacing kung-fu fanatic who daydreams of being a great warrior - in his head; Po destroys thousands of enemies, blinding them with the glare of his awesomeness. His plus-size silliness and an honest-to-goodness love for old school kung-fu set the stage perfectly for everything that follows. He idolizes both the art of kung-fu and legendary local fighters the Furious Five - Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross), together proving to be a terrific voice cast. Under the watchful eye of a kung-fu master, a critter named Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), the Five stand by knowing one among them will be chosen as the prophesied Dragon Warrior when the time comes.Soon Shifu's master, the wizened turtle Oogway, declares it's time to choose the new master. But he doesn't select one of the well-prepared Furious Five to protect the Valley of Peace; instead he picks our slovenly, rotund hero instead as the fabled Dragon Warrior. Now afforded an opportunity to demonstrate his worth, Po tries desperately to prove himself to wise old Master Shifu and his new, skeptical dojo-mates. A lot of comic mischief ensues, as Po topples over, bumps into things and sends stuff flying like a fat, furry version of the Chuckle Brothers. The Five, initially seen as spiteful of Po's sudden fame, soon accede to the temple master, while Shifu learns to let go of his past failures and appreciate the wisdom of Oogway.Then something rather wonderful happens, ratcheting the film up to the dizzying heights. In an exhilarating sequence, Tai Lung – the psychotic snow-leopard who wants to get his hands on the Dragon Scroll that will afford him infinite power- escapes by negotiating the three fiendish levels of the jail in a flurry of punches, kicks and gravity-defying leaps that culminate in a magnificent series of vertigo-inducing shots. Everything comes together at the finale, when Po, having learned that his technique is based on his appetite, faces off against Tai Lung.As Po, Jack Black provides goof-ball hyperbole at its 'Jack Blackiest'. With an over-amped bravado and childlike excitement, he creates a memorable slacker who, in spite of himself, still manages to rise to the occasion. He's well-matched by Hoffman, who gives the diminutive Shifu a brooding soul and a sage humor. Co-directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenson mix Black's good humor with breathtaking animated action sequences, allowing the film to play out as one heck of a tribute to the martial arts genre. From the devilishly clever sequence where the Furious Five take on Tai Lung on an unraveling rope bridge, to a hugely enjoyable training sequence between Shifu and Po and the final showdown between Po and Tai Lung, directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenson take advantage of the limitless possibilities of CGI to bring us action on a scale, and of a type, rarely seen before.At the end, Kung Fu Panda proves to be dazzling, clever entertainment. The adventures of Po earn every smile, every gasp, every eye-popping thrill, and they do it all with a hearty, winking 'Skidoosh!'",9,0,0,13 August 2015
Chinatown," Roman Polanski's Caustic Neo-Noir is So Compelling that 'You Can't Forget It'!
","It's Los Angeles, 1937. Jack Nicholson's private detective Jake J. Gittes is not a primal masculine archetype, but rather a complicated protagonist. Far from cool and collected, he is simply self- possessed, with a sense of control that's highly illusory and much of the film pivots on undercutting his misplaced self-confidence. The film immediately establishes his less-than-ideal persona via his work snapping pictures of adulterous spouses, a lowbrow form of detective work that is typically beneath the more admirable private eyes. He's looked down on by the law and treated as something of a sordid but necessary evil by his clients, but Jake realizes that's just how the game is played. Soon enough, though, one of those clients, a mysterious woman named Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray finds a way to use Jake's scurrilous reputation to set him up for a fall. His ensuing attempts to clear his name put him on the trail of a case that's bigger, more complex and wide-ranging than anything he's used to, coming up with more rot than he bargained for. One that goes, as they say, all the way to the top!A convoluted mystery that begins with a visit from a femme-fatale, an ironclad cynical detective with a code of honor, and a spider- like villain weaving a web at the center of the story are all familiar elements of a hard-boiled detective film. But trust Roman Polanski to make disillusionment seductive and resurrect the almost dead format! What he does so brilliantly in Chinatown is import the soul-sick paranoia of 1930s Los Angeles into its depiction: the eponymous Chinatown is less of a physical presence than a state of mind - it's a lurid fantasy, an idea that hovers constantly around the fringes of the movie making it an ultimately intangible maelstrom of deceit, regret and confusion in which the only thing you can be sure of is that everything you know is - to one degree or another - wrong. Robert Towne's labyrinthine script keeps the proceedings thrilling, humorous and disturbing at the same time, pepped up greatly by the crackling dialogues.The film also boasts career best turns from its star-cast led by Jack Nicholson, who is absolutely charismatic as Jake Gittes, as we find ourselves solve the mystery alongside him as he follows lead after lead through a labyrinth of sticky situations. His Gittes is a layered character and Nicholson makes his depth visible to the audience. Faye Dunaway's vulnerability constantly tempts us with the notion that she is the victim, rather than the villain, in a performance that still has the power to shock. Outright villainy is instead embodied by Noah Cross, an incredibly vile portrayal by John Huston. He gives Noah a false air of courtly manners that, if anything, only adds to the character's sense of debauchery.Notoriously bleak, yet utterly compelling, Chinatown remains a magnificent dissection of corruption right up to its enigmatic finale. The brute force of its ugly truth is the heart of the film's artistry, and it sticks with us. And it might be just a state of mind, but Chinatown still retains the power to bruise and scar to this day.",9,2,3,4 May 2015
Lone Survivor," 'Lone Survivor' Is A Ball-Breaker of A Film!
","War is a lot of things, but it's useless to pretend that exciting isn't one of them. From an adrenaline standpoint that might well be the case, but in every other respect, from every other possible viewpoint, it's an inescapable waking nightmare that you'd never wish upon anyone. If that doesn't ring true for you, go see 'Lone Survivor'.Adapted from a memoir by Marcus Luttrell, it tells the story of a special unit of the U.S army comprising of four SEALs led by Marcus himself, who are sent on a mission to kill a Taliban leader in Afghanistan. The four bunker down in the mountains in search of their target, but when the squad silently moves within sight of the compound where the besieged commander is seen training his men, they realize the mission is going to be far different than anticipated. Soon they find themselves outnumbered, pinned down on a scraggy hill. With phone signals going out in the mountainous terrain, barring them from calling in an exfiltration, a fight for their lives begins. Pursued through inhospitable mountains by several hundred Taliban and cut off from their support, a wretched retreat follows, where the exploits of those four soldiers quite simply defy belief.Mark Wahlberg, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster and Taylor Kitsch play the four imperiled SEALs, and from the moment they elect to abort the mission, 'Lone Survivor' becomes a ball-breaker of a film, as you slowly see shock and fear overtake their bodies. Each actor sells the utter terror of the situation and there is a visceral element to the performances as each character is mutilated beyond recognition. They give an incredible amount of emotional weight to the moments where their characters must face their fate, even though the plot is shackled to a definitive outcome.Director Peter Berg captures the raw intensity of combat and carnage on both sides of the battlefront and the heroics that forge an indelible spirit in combat. Working with a crutch of a title, there is an incredible amount of pressure on Berg to implement the 'how' element of the story and he overcomes the challenge with the precision of the army commandos he's portraying. He takes his time getting to the conflict and the anticipation of the skirmish is extreme because you're expecting the worst and that's exactly what you get. The skirmishes are gut wrenching in their brutality and Berg puts you in tight confines of makeshift foxholes and rifle sights to amplify the claustrophobia of the situation. Shot in furious sweeps and featuring smashing sound design, it is heart stopping watching the soldiers scramble across rocky outcrops and tumble down cliffs with their bones crunching against trees and boulders; the stunt work is astonishing. Berg trips up a little on a few slow motion edits that break the gritty realism but when the unit take stock on their ghastly wounds you're jolted back into the hopelessness of the situation.This is a war movie at its most confronting; it terrifyingly captures the confusion, brutality, chaos and intensity of combat in a way. It's a suffocating sort of tension - with all its bone-breaking, blood-splattering, white-knuckle skirmish - and whilst there's no question the movie suffers from some clumsy jingoism, the experience is so palpable, you frequently find yourself ducking in your own seat.",9,0,1,11 February 2016
Erin Brockovich," Julia Roberts is Fiercely Dynamic in the Smart and Savvy Erin Brockovich!
","Steven Soderbergh's Erin Brockovich opens with a car accident. The vehicle driven by Erin, an unemployed, twice-divorced mother of three, is broadsided by a speeding car at an intersection. She takes her case to a rumpled, cowed lawyer Ed Masry, who agrees to represent her on a contingency basis. However, in court, Erin's surly manner and blasphemous vocabulary do not endear her to the jury, which finds itself in the defendant's favor, as Erin goes home empty-handed. Still without work and needing to pay her bills, Erin, who has no demonstrable skills, but a passion, an uncommon quantity of common sense, and a defiant way of talking, finagles her way into a position as a file clerk under her former attorney.It is in this capacity that she uncovers, entirely by accident, a paper trail leading to the town of Hinkley, CA, where an endless stream of residents have been diagnosed with various medical conditions including cancer, disintegrating spinal cords and brain damage. It turns out that the community of Hinkley has been poisoned by hexavalent chromium, leaching into the drinking water from the Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) plant. The case is especially odious because PG&E knew exactly what it was doing but lied about what kind of chromium it was using. Erin gains the trust of the community to mount legal action and strong-arms Ed to put together a case that would win the largest direct claim settlement in American history, even as her personal life is threatened by her devotion to the case.Steven Soderbergh tests Erin's limits of likability numerous times throughout the movie. An early scene is designed to show what a short fuse Erin has when she explodes in a torrent of profanity in the courtroom. Erin, the film makes clear early on, is no sentimental crusader. Rather, she is a tough, hard-nosed cookie who dresses like a hoochie and who would use anything from here heavily coiffured hair to her cleavage or also her baby to get what she needs. In short, Erin is adrift in a hard world. But what makes this potentially despicable character so affable is Julia Roberts' vulnerable and fiercely dynamic performance. As the eponymous character, she is undoubtedly the heart and soul of the film. As a foil for Erin, Albert Finney draws out a complex, engaging performance that is as warm as it is funny. Their scenes together crackle with chemistry and it's a joy to see this kind of male/female interaction where there is absolutely no hint of sexual attraction. Soderbergh infuses the proceedings with a vibrant, almost peppy sense of style that would not have been half as compelling had a less edgy director helmed it. It would have been easy for him to have allowed Erin Brockovich to descend into manipulative melodrama, but he resists that path of least resistance, instead giving us a film that is smart, savvy, funny, and, at times, poignant.",9,11,11,27 April 2015
Se7en," Se7en is a Sinfully Enthralling Thriller!
","Se7en is a nerve-jangling thriller, hauntingly shot by visionary director David Fincher, who crafts one of the most iconic films of all time.Se7en tells the tale of a grisly serial killer who is twisted on delivering a sermon against modern depravity. He murders his victims to atone for the sins he deems them to have committed; his crimes echo the seven deadly sins namely gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, pride, wrath and lust. Tracking this gruesome killer (played with a quiet insanity that makes your flesh crawl, by an actor par excellence – no spoilers here!) is a cliché pair of cops. There's the jaded veteran Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman who brings great depth and dignity to the part) who is in the last week of his employ with the police department. Partnering him is a young, eager-to-kick-some-evil-butt cop Detective Mills (Brad Pitt whose callowness works perfectly for his character). After killing an overweight man by force-feeding him to death in the name of gluttony and bleeding to death a lawyer for greed, the anonymous killer is now turning his attention to the five remaining deadly sins. As the two men investigate, the gulf between their respective world-views begins to inform everything about how they respond to the savagery of these crimes.It is impossible to deny the potency and artistry with which Fincher executes the material. Although very little of each murder is shown, the director expertly allows suggestion to lead the appalled viewer towards the truly cataclysmic climax. Fincher's sepia-toned gloom successfully lends the film the knock-out punch it intends to. Purposely draining his landscapes of color, and setting all the tense action against rain-washed streets and under-lit interiors, Fincher evokes an atmosphere of nightmarish proportions as he unfolds a gripping tale of urban horror. Se7en is riveting in a gut-twisting way. It plays out at an engaging pace destined to entrance you with its abject horror. The film is as dark and brutal as a film can be, without showing much actual violence. Most of the stuff in the film is implied, but it's so damn disturbing that you feel like you actually saw it. And that is the beauty of Se7en!",10,3,4,24 March 2015
Memento," Nolan's Brain-Wringing Memento will Not Be Easily Forgotten!
","Many psychological thrillers rely on twists to deliver their climactic pay-off. But director Christopher Nolan's brain-wringing psycho noir Memento isn't just a movie with a twist - It is a twist! Essentially, Memento is a straightforward revenge flick with the central protagonist out to track down the man who raped and murdered his wife. But this standard plot comes with an ingenious twist, as we soon find out that our befuddled hero is on a voyage of self- discovery like no other. Matters are complicated by the fact that the person investigating the killing Leonard Shelby (an outstanding Guy Pearce, eliciting sympathy and hinting at the rage behind his obsession, while also leavening the character with moments of humor) has the memory of a goldfish – a rare form of amnesia leaving him with no short-term memory. Forced to record everything with copious notes, Polaroid photographs and even tattoos, Leonard's obsession leads him into a world where no one can be trusted. This coupled with Christopher Nolan's audacious conceit that necessitates the plot to run backwards, makes Memento a dazzling, highly original 'anti-thriller'. Thus, we begin with the climactic murder then regress through the events that led up to it to wind up, well, at the beginning!Memento is a mesmerizing mind-bender, a diabolical and absorbing experience that requires a lot of concentration, but the stunning final scene is ample reward. Christopher Nolan builds a mousetrap of a neo-noir, using the tricky gimmick of a complex, purposefully disorienting narrative that puts us in the scrambled mind of its protagonist. As the strangely captivating screenplay unfolds in scenes of reverse order, he gives us a taste of Leonard's frustrating existence: events unfolding for the audience in the same way they unfold for Pearce's character. We're thrown out of time and robbed of the comfort of a (chrono)logical unspooling of information. Nolan cranks up the suspense, keeps the story sharp and pacey, and isn't afraid to layer in a little ultra-black humor. The impact is insidious - chances are your brain will be replaying this fiendish puzzle of a film for months to come.Christopher Nolan's cinematic gaze into an abyss of madness, obsession, identity and wrath remains a compelling puzzle long after its revelations have rolled out. Of all the ironies which fill the film, the most complementary may be that this is film which will not soon be forgotten.",9,0,2,30 April 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino 'In-Glorious'ly Vintage Form!
","Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarantino's self-indulgent love letter to war movies —his version of a war drama, with history rewritten to avenge the guilty in ways that satisfy his pop-art cinephilia. It is the vintage filmmaker's rewrite of World War II with a spaghetti western vibe and a cinephile fantasy that a movie theater could defeat the most reviled figure in human history and end all war. It should be noted at the outset that Tarantino's treatment of the Second World War is unquestionably superficial. Don't look for nuance or depth or for refined scrutiny of what lay behind the Holocaust! Laying his story out in five riveting chapters, Tarantino manages to keep his densely populated tale clear. To put it curtly, the movie centers on a plan to assassinate Nazi leaders (including the Fuhrer) by a group of Jewish-American soldiers (the Basterds from the title) that coincides with a theater owner's (whose family was brutally massacred by a ghastly Jew-Hunter SS Colonel Hans Landa) vengeful plans for the same. Christoph Waltz, delivers a purring, eye-rolling, wonderfully (and intentionally) hammy performance as Col. Landa, underplaying the cold-bloodedness of the character to arresting affect. Brad Pitt is hilarious as hillbilly officer Lt. Aldo Raine, flaunting a cracker-barrel Southern drawl. The rest of the primary cast plays their parts with aplomb.But, you can't help but admire Tarantino's chutzpah! Despite the wartime setting, we're still in Tarantino's universe. He assembles the tale like a juxtaposition of protracted sequences, each with copious amounts of verbal foreplay. The payoff is usually worth the wait, with telltale tough talk and violent punctuation eventually leading to a bloody massacre in almost every sequence. The violence is often extreme but it comes in bursts and has a comic book element about it. What really propels the movie, though, isn't the gun- toting but Tarantino's brilliantly ingenious dialog and self- assured direction. Nobody has giddier fun making movies than Quentin Tarantino, and it's almost contagious. In every scene, you sense him behind the camera, giggling at his handiwork, winking impishly.Even the film's final line — 'I think this just might be my masterpiece' — sounds like the writer-director being cocky through his lead actor. Inglourious Basterds reaffirms Tarantino as an impudent dude who'll err, but never on the side of caution.",9,0,2,25 March 2015
The Impossible," While Trying to Recreate the Horror of 2004, Bayona Manages to Do 'The Impossible'!
","A married doctor couple, Maria (Watts) and Henry (McGregor), has brought their three young boys on a much-needed vacation to the coast of the Indian Ocean. In a scenic resort, the brood fit in for a gorgeous afternoon poolside with nary a Christmas tree in sight and their holiday plans prepared for a beautiful vacation. That day, however, was not to be the one they had hoped for.A mere fifteen minutes into the film, a slight breeze catches Maria's hair, quickly turning into a whipping gust of wind. It's one thing to hear stories of tsunamis and the spontaneity with which they appear, but it's another thing to see it happen in front of you. No warning. The ground rumbles, vacationers scatter and scream, their world about to be turned upside down, forever. From complete relaxation to impending death. No warning.Separated by rushing water and dangerous terrain, Maria and their eldest son Lucas (Holland) travel as best they can on her severely wounded leg towards civilization and hopefully help. The first half of the film focuses on this pair as if Henry and their other two children were swept into the sea like so many others. Henry, however, is still alive and his chapter begins at the halfway point when he tries to seek Maria and Lucas out. From then on, it becomes about the apparently insurmountable logistics involved in getting this family back together.Technically impeccable, 'The Impossible' gives the brutal caprice of nature its due, never romanticizing it or demonizing it. It begins as a steady radio dial, suddenly and violently spun into fits of static and garbled chaos. Director Juan Antonio Bayona conducts this symphony with a steady hand and a wonderful visual eye. He spins the focus in on a single family caught up in the disaster, personalizing the horror and bringing it home in unashamedly melodramatic fashion on its very own tidal wave of emotion. While doing so, Bayona creates one of the most traumatizing and realistic disaster sequences in history. Avoiding the temptation to fill his piece with dramatic underscore that swells as our protagonists are tumbled in the muddy waters of the invading ocean, Bayona removes all musical accompaniment for this portion permitting loudness and utter silence to fill our senses along with visual stimuli that will leave you scarcely able to breathe. This swift wrath of nature is expertly realized, but the heart of the film is in its characters and how they respond to the betrayal of the world around them.Naomi Watts, in her career best performance, expresses the rooted emotions of a mother both physically and emotionally, filling the film with so much fearlessness and unshakable motivation, that she enraptures the audience with her survival instincts. Ewan McGregor provides able support as the distressed father and is extremely competent. Tom Holland delivers one of the strongest juvenile debuts seen in years, conveying a complex series of emotions with natural serenity.The Impossible separates itself from the other disaster films by focusing not just on the scale of the mayhem, but the intimacy of the struggle. Yes it takes us back to an epic nightmare that was the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004, but the flashback is vertiginous and horrible and oddly poetic.",9,9,10,21 April 2016
Argo," Ben Affleck's 'Argo' is A Crackerjack Political Thriller!
","The old adage 'Truth is stranger than fiction' has its teeth properly sharpened in Ben Affleck's brilliant thriller Argo, a blend of political history and Hollywood hijinks that goes right for the jugular. The film begins by spiriting us back to the American hostage crisis in Iran. It's November 1979, and a mob is howling outside the gates of the American Embassy in Tehran. When they break through and storm the building, 52 Americans are taken hostage, but amid the chaos six manage to escape and find refuge in the house of the Canadian ambassador. Ten weeks later, with the Iranian intelligence services closing in on the fugitives, the CIA are still floating desperate schemes to rescue them. Enter 'exfiltration' specialist Tony Mendez (a fabulously understated Affleck), who concocts a desperate, yet ingenious scheme of his own while watching a Planet of the Apes on TV. The six stowaways will get out of Iran posing as a Canadian film crew on a location scout. All they need is a film to pretend to be scouting for. They know it's a bad idea but 'it is the best bad idea' they have got. This is where Mendez's inventive genius comes in. To keep the numbers in his favor, Mendez sets up a phony production company and enlists two showbiz old-timers (a delightfully crotchety producer Alan Arkin and a charming make-up artist John Goodman) to get the fake movie (a terrible Star Wars knock-off called Argo) noticed by the media. If Mendez doesn't already have enough on his plate, there are multiple passports to be forged, and a lot of fast talking to be done. One minor slip-up, and everyone dies - including himself. The many whirring pieces of the plot click into gorgeous synchronicity as the escape begins, with the CIA keeping the operation running back home, the house-guests swallowing their fear, and Mendez at the center of it all keeping a cool head and an implacable stare. Ben Affleck does such a spectacular job of establishing the many dangers in Tehran, from hot-headed guards at the airport to the maid at the ambassador's house under pressure to sell out the house-guests that every step of the escape feels like a minefield, the tension ratcheted up deliciously. The acting of the ensemble cast - led strongly by Affleck, - is faultless.It is no small compliment to hail Argo as one heck of an efficient movie machine. The product it churns out - packed not only with gripping drama, but surprising bursts of humor amidst the tension and the danger - just cannot fail to impress. It leaves the daring to the plot itself and allows the crackerjack precision of the story to be what blows you away.Ben Affleck's dynamite film Argo isn't just a tense, impeccably acted thriller, but is the kind of serious drama that leaves you smiling because of how marvelously well it pulls everything off.",9,0,2,23 December 2015
12 Angry Men," One of the Greatest of All Time - Beyond a Reasonable Doubt!
","From a distance, 12 Angry Men might look like your customary courtroom drama that Hollywood churns out every couple of years. Look closer and you will find that Sidney Lumet's debut turn as a director is an exemplary study in characterization and a crash course in pure filmmaking.Most of the action takes place within the confines of a single room on what is supposedly 'the hottest day of the year'. A jury made up of 12 men has to decide the fate of a teenage boy who is accused of a gruesome murder. The defendant has everything going against him - a couple of witnesses, a murder weapon, a sloppy public attorney and the fact that he is from a less privileged class of the society. Over the next 95 minutes, 12 Angry Man watches as 11 jurors, first convinced of the suspect's guilt overcome their less than democratic prejudices and are slowly won over to the side of reasonable doubt by one man's doubts about the accused's guilt.Sidney Lumet creates energy and movement through quick editing and varying camera angles, which makes the film pulse with power and emotion despite its one set location. Operating within the constrictions of a limited budget, Lumet tightens the noose by accentuating the excruciating pulse of the ceiling fan and slowly narrowing his shots on his characters as the film approaches its climax. A special mention should be made here of ace cameraman Boris Kaufman, who ratchets up the claustrophobia with every close-up and ably heightens the drama, despite the confining setting. The actors – all 12 of them – are top notch as the '12 Angry Men' in what is to date one of the best ensemble casts to have graced the silver screen.The drama plays out at an engaging pace making this brilliant war of words an entrancing cinematic experience. Lumet gives us an incisive and gripping film that is as relevant today as it was almost 60 years back. If you love movies, you owe it to yourself to see this one!",10,2,3,18 March 2015
Finding Nemo," An Underwater Treasure!
","Pixar's animation wonder Finding Nemo, is a shimmery, velvety undersea coming-of-age story which is aglow with translucent sea flora and gleaming, iridescent creatures. Australia's Great Barrier Reef provides a stunning starting point for this aquatic parable. Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a spunky little clown-fish with a slight disability - a foreshortened front fin. Nemo's single father, Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a dry, wry clown-fish with an excess of anxiety (He is also a clown who can't tell a joke, though he keeps trying to do so quite hilariously). Despite Marlin's suffocating attention, his small fry is scooped up by a scuba diving dentist and gets separated from his father. Determined not to lose his son, Marlin begins a long, arduous albeit seemingly hopeless rescue mission across the sea and soon bumps into an overly exuberant, sweetly scatterbrained regal blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). They search for Nemo together in the face of stinging jellyfish, exploding mines, noxious sharks and other irritable flounders. In the meantime, Nemo makes some very good friends in the dentist's aquarium, including a tiger fish (Willem Dafoe) who helps him plan an escape. From then on, it's a relentless journey of visual excitement and wonder, as the distraught father sets off to rescue his offspring and Nemo finds ways to escape from the aquarium. As is mandatory for a family film, there are plenty of life lessons for kids to learn, but they come sugar-coated with humor and fun. Meanwhile, a more adult undercurrent offers grown-up laughs, and there's even some old-fashioned tear-jerking to complete the emotional roller-coaster ride.Andrew Stanton plays the viewer like a fiddle, and it's a privilege to be played. Its animation is truly stunning, awash (pun intended) in a dazzling array of colors and creating the impression of a living, breathing sea. Every moment is magnificently orchestrated to tease a response from us - anything from awe to aw-shucks. Yes, it's a visual feast, but more importantly it's an epic journey filled with adventure and discovery that encompasses the grandest sweep of the ocean's vastness and the tiniest longing of the heart. While preserving the characters' intrinsic 'fishy-ness', the silver- tongued voice cast offers great supplementary texture to a marvelous sensory experience. While Brooks is amusing as the ever fretful Marlin, it is DeGeneres who gives a bravura comic performance as the guileless but whacked-out Dory. Ceaselessly forgetful, her endearing Dory makes a difficult traveling companion but a scintillating friend – Dory is a complete hoot.Instead of rising to a challenge, Finding Nemo plunges into it and comes up a winner. All in all, a buoyant adventure that manages to evoke the quicksilver trait of the ocean without necessarily feeling 'wet'!",10,1,2,31 March 2015
L.A. Confidential," Probes the Seamy Underbelly Beneath the Surface Allure of 1950's L.A!
","Spicy and boiling-hot, the sensational noir style crime drama L.A. Confidential is a morality play disguised as pulp fiction - a sprawling saga of venality and redemption set against a flashy 1950's Los Angeles backdrop of easy money, blazing guns and cheap, illicit thrills told with a cool eye and overwhelming evil. Based on James Ellroy's 1990 novel, the movie's L.A. is a shining place where almost everybody has a guilty secret. That includes the triumvirate of LAPD cops - the flamboyant 'Hollywood Jack' Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), the bare-knuckled brute veteran Wendell 'Bud' White (Russell Crowe) and the straight-arrow, rich kid Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) - who are thrown together during several investigations and the scandalous tabloid journalist Hudgeons (Danny DeVito) who spews them out to the public. When a nightclub massacre leaves six dead, including a disgraced ex-cop, three black juveniles are arrested soon thereafter. But this apparently cut-and-dried case leads to more insidious developments. As our lead cops dig deeper into what at first seems a simple shootout in a downtown diner, they come to believe that the bust was a setup, the dead suspects fall guys and soon discover links to a furtive call-girl ring run by vice king Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), whose hookers (including Lynn Bracken played by Kim Basinger) have been surgically altered to resemble famous Hollywood stars. Despite their antagonism toward each other - exacerbated by their mutual attraction to Lynn - Exley and White link up to get to the bottom of it all. Drugs, prostitution, dirty politics in high places and mob wars - everything that feeds scurrilous magazines like Hudgeon's 'Hush Hush' becomes the reality the three cops disinter. And it gets worse as they go deeper. Ingeniously adapted by Curtis Hanson and his co-writer, Brian Helgeland, L.A.Confidential is a juicy noir stew of amorality that's gives us a richly populated, self-contained little world that operates according to its own rules. That world is unsavory and grim, an un-magical kingdom of gleaming mansions and corpses rotting in basements. But Hanson and his actors make it a world we believe. The three central cops are all pungent, colorful and terrifically well-played; their combined charisma almost smashing through the screen. Spacey oozes ring-a-ding charm and is slyly hilarious as preening, showboat cop Vincennes. Crowe bristles with hair-trigger tension and exudes a unique and sexy toughness. Pearce makes a wonderful prude who perfectly catches the 'no-flies-on-me' swagger of a rich boy on the rise. Although she's playing a stock character, Basinger exudes a chaste sultriness and is terrific as a Veronica Lake double. The large supporting cast is tops, too. It's hard to imagine a better slimy scandal-sniffer than DeVito, a colder-hearted cop than Cromwell or a smugger vice lord than Strathairn.L.A. Confidential is a movie bull's-eye: noir with an attitude, a thriller packing punches that gives up its evil secrets with a smile.",9,2,3,16 April 2015
The Prestige," Nolan Weaves Magic - Abracadabra!
","'Are you watching closely?' Just as magicians use this gibe on their audience, the makers here keep constantly nudging its audience throughout this tricky thriller. The Prestige is a carefully crafted story of trickery and deception of two rival magicians in Victorian England, directed by the greatest magician of them all: Christopher Nolan. It is a taut, exciting portrait of obsession and the dark competitive spirit of professional magicians. Set in a world of top hats, cravats and disappearing bunnies, The Prestige tells the tale of Alfred Bowden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Jackman), who start out as fledgling magician apprentices. They get locked in a bitter feud after the death of an assistant in an illusion gone wrong and subsequently go in search of the ultimate trick. As their quest to become the greatest magician becomes resilient, the counter maneuvers escalate and elevate each man to greater achievement in their desire to be the best. Just when it seems clear that Borden's obsession could only be satisfied by Angier's death, the film turns in on itself again, and we're left searching the stage for clues, grow even more anxious for the big prestige. Soon, flashbacks switch to flash forwards, and quickly we're entangled in a murky conundrum. But that's all I will say. You wouldn't want me to spoil the prestige for you now!Nolan keeps the mood eerie and unsettling, and with all its Gothic trimmings The Prestige comes to feel like a slow-burn horror movie. There are nifty tricks galore up the sumptuous sleeve of this mystifying and wildly entertaining thriller, about obsession, secrets and lies. As is his want, Nolan jumps between time periods and voice-overs with reckless abandon. The movie's real trick is that it all somehow manages to congeal. You know all along you're being misdirected by cinematic sleight of hand, but you can't avoid being sucked in and that is Nolan's greatest triumph. Of course, he is ably buoyed by a pair of carefully complex performances from his superb lead cast who weave the film's heftier ideas seamlessly into the breathable fabric of a great thriller.Nolan has been exploring the dual nature of man throughout his extraordinary career. With The Prestige though, Nolan takes this aspect to new realms. He directs the film exactly like a great trick, so you want to see it again the second it's over. You will leave the cinema posed with the exact same question 'Was I watching closely?'",10,0,2,23 March 2015
The Terminator," You Will Sure Wish The Terminator is Back!
","In the not-too-distant future, machines rule the Earth and are locked in combat with a gallant band of freedom fighters led by their leader John Connor. Soon a murderous cyborg the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) - a remorseless, relentless bogeyman with a bone- crushing steel skeleton and a soul-piercing red diode glare - is sent back in time from the future to kill the mother of the as-yet- unborn leader of the human rebellion. Back in present-day Los Angeles, his mother – a timorous pushover waitress Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) - is unaware of her role in the struggles to come, until the arrival of our titular terminator, whose only purpose is to kill her and thereby change the future. Her only hope is a bashful guerrilla fighter Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who has followed the T-800 back through time to prevent her death and evade any and all attacks from the killer cyborg, while gradually forming a romance with her throughout the mission to preserve her life. Can the Terminator track Sarah down and change the course of the future?The story is deceptively tricky: In comparison to today's packaged thrillers, this is a surprisingly vicious little film, filled with indiscriminate killings and a rough-edged feel that makes it utterly compelling. James Cameron's direction of the ensuing chaos is masterful, and the characterization of the violence has something agonizingly original about it. He manages to generate maximum excitement from the very first frame and the dynamic thrills are maintained right up to the nerve-jangling climax. What really propels the movie, though, isn't the savagery but a well-written and taut screenplay with a nice eye for sharp detail that doesn't tend to drift off into the occasional ponderous bits. There's real heart and soul here, along with Arnold's best-ever performance - as a lumbering slab of dumb, destructive strength. Hamilton's performance as the bewildered waitress who will unwittingly become the savior of the human race is terrific. Biehn shines as Sarah's knight in shining armor.The Terminator grabs us right away and carries us to the end with roller-coaster action sequences and clever time-travel twists. What it results in is arguably the best science fiction thriller of all time that throttles you with the air of a demented ballet.",9,3,3,28 April 2015
Hotel Rwanda," Don't Forget to Check Into this Hotel!
","A decade after tribal extremists in Rwanda organized a blitzkrieg of ethnic killing while the world minced its words, Hotel Rwanda spilled out on the screen, aiming to remind us of evils hurriedly forgotten and lessons still unlearnt.The film picks up just before the presidential assassination. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is a Hutu hotel manager, married to a Tutsi, who never underestimates the value of a bribe, greasing the wheels of commerce and police protection with the occasional bottle of single malt. When the Hutu president is killed by Tutsi rebels, Hutu extremists take to the streets with machetes, slaughtering every Tutsi 'cockroach' they see. Paul finds the four-star hotel he manages turned into an impromptu refugee camp, as Tutsi refugees and their families rush in, seeking out what little protection he can offer. He trusts, still however, in the goodwill of the West. He believes that his activities will be temporary, and that rescue is on its way. But he doesn't immediately grasp what is happening: the West, catching the odd news report, have dismissed the genocide as 'just a bunch of Africans killing each other again', before flipping channels. The UN force, led by a self-disgustedly impotent Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) does what it can to help but it soon becomes clear that Paul will have to rely on his own resilience and back catalog of favors to keep as many of the Tutsi alive as he can. Filled with indelible, haunting images, Hotel Rwanda is a moving and provocative film that shows how one man can make a difference, even when the evils and horrors around him appear unsurmountable. The film is beautifully understated, eschewing sentimentality in favor of raw emotion and letting the story tell itself. Director Terry George handles the potentially suffocating subject matter with a grace and subtlety that breathes precious life into a heart- wrenching story about the wretched effects of hateful propaganda and an outside world concerned with capitalism over humanity. George never sugarcoats any of the violence - the violence comes frequently and unexpectedly, making for a lasting impression of horrific imageries (Watch Paul floundering among a scattered sea of corpses that he'd unwittingly been driving over in the dawn fog).Knuckling down to a native accent, Don Cheadle gives a beautifully restrained tour-de-force performance as a singular voice of reason at the epicenter of the carnage. The actor transforms from suave schmoozer of militia leaders, to protective family man, to a reluctant savior who's forever struggling to maintain his fragile composure, all the while sidestepping every histrionic outburst you'd expect. Sophie Okonedo pulls out an equally stirring portrayal of Paul's Tutsi wife, Tatiana while bigger names like Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte - effortlessly energize the smaller roles.All in all, this is a film of rare courage and imperishable heart that deserves to be seen.",10,0,0,15 April 2015
Pan's Labyrinth," A Hauntingly Spectacular Labyrinth - One You Wouldn't Mind getting Lost In!
","Like any great myth, Pan's Labyrinth encrypts its messages through displays of magic. The result of the intricate interplay that we witness on screen is a fairy tale for adults that is violent, sometimes shocking, yet utterly engrossing.It's 1944 and Spain's Civil War has left the country ravaged and battling pockets of rebels. Posted to regain order in one such enclave, tyrannous Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) travels to a remote home in North Spain with his pregnant wife and 12-year-old step- daughter, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero). Besotted with ancient tales, Ofelia disconnects from the violence around her by wandering into a derelict labyrinth to encounter creatures that once existed only in her fertile fantasies. Here she meets the garrulous faun who informs her she's the princess of a subterranean kingdom, and in characteristic fairy-tale fashion, she's given three tasks to perform before the full moon. And thus begins del Toro's unnerving fairy tale that blends fantasy and gloomy drama into one of the most magical films to come along in years.It's a heartbreaking tale of cruelty and hopelessness, softened only by the wondrous fantasy of Ofelia's imaginary world. A bold juxtaposition of real and unreal worlds is at the heart of Guillermo del Toro's visually inventive fantasy. Del Toro presents both the narrative strands as equally real, equally plausible. There's no attempt to rationalize Ofelia's parallel universe by suggesting it's a dream or a fantasy. In fact the two sides of the film come together to constitute an allegory about the soul and the national identity of Spain in an almost surreal fashion. Ivana Baquero is in brilliant form manifesting a child's fears and uncertainties through little more than widened eyes and shortened breath. Through sheer force of personality, Sergi López turns Captain Vidal into a convincing yet allegorical metaphor for chauvinistic masculinity and in the end, offers an incomparably sinister character.Guillermo Del Toro gives us a film which is both searing and haunting as it takes us from the bleak to the sublime. It imagines both the beauty and horror inherent to escapism and, while weaving an intricate tale, vividly draws a world more enticing but no more monstrous than our own. The spell it casts lingers long after the final reel!",9,2,5,23 March 2015
Alien," Alien Rips You Out of Your Stupor!
","There's something eerie and absolutely unnerving about Ridley Scott's 'Alien' from the moment it begins.For the first 45 minutes, very little happens. We float silently around a huge, empty spaceship, Ridley Scott masterfully conjuring the mood as his patient directorial gaze explores the mechanical womb of the commercial towing vessel Nostromo.. Even without its extra- terrestrial threat, Nostromo is an unsettling place - a gigantic haunted house drifting through the most unforgiving environment known to man. The aforementioned spaceship intercepts a distress call from a distant planet and wakes up its crew including Ripley (Sigourney Weaver giving a tough-as-nails portrayal in what is arguably the greatest female character committed to celluloid), which was in stasis en-route to Earth. The feel here is slightly groggy, as if the film, as well as the crew, still hasn't completely woken up yet. They land on the barren planet and discover a huge, derelict space craft where they stumble onto a strange life form in a repository of extraterrestrial eggs. Soon, a multiple legged monster launches on to one curious crew member, impregnating him with a vicious alien being. It comes back aboard slapped across his face and ends up grinding its way through his chest the next morning (in the now-iconic chest bursting sequence), as a horrible creature that rapidly evolves into a full-grown, acid- blooded killer that begins picking off the crew one by one. It soon transforms in to a battle for life for Ripley who evades the relentless force of nature that's infiltrated her ship at all costs and the movie that started off as a daydream quickly turns into a nightmare.Ridley Scott spawns a truly creepy tale that introduces real heart palpitating fear into the sci-fi equation. Right from the start, he cues us in to what Alien will be: a distinctly deliberate exercise in terror. The level of suspense and fear that he ratchets up is excruciating, as cleverly devised plot points and character revelations keep the audience off balance right up to the final frame. He displays an eye for detail and a brilliant way of alternating false scares with genuine jolts, which help to create a seamless blend of Gothic horror and harrowing science fiction. He also manages to keep the alien enigmatic and swift, rather than just a lumbering beast hogging the screen.Alien continues to resonate as a brilliant sci-fi/horror hybrid that seems like a simplistic monster in the house picture but reveals layers underneath its somewhat simplistic premise, going well beyond the usual genre trappings. This is a must-have cinematic experience that will leave you shivering and adrenalized.",9,1,3,22 April 2015
Shutter Island," Scorsese Embarks on A Journey to The Mysterious Island!
","As Martin Scorsese's impeccably assembled thriller Shutter Island opens, we see a ferryboat emerging out of a Stygian murk so impenetrable it might well be taking Orpheus to the Underworld. On board are two U.S. Marshals fittingly attired in a trench-coat and fedora - frazzled WWII veteran Teddy Daniels (a resilient performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, delving into the psychological depths of his character) and his affable new partner Chuck Aule (a wonderfully understated Mark Ruffalo) heading towards Shutter Island, a storm-battered, rugged fortress occupied by Ashecliffe hospital, a high-security federal asylum for the criminally insane, where they have been summoned to investigate the disappearance of an delusional, infanticidal inmate Rachel Saldano. Daniels immerses himself into the investigation with unhealthy abandon.But he has quite a few demons of his own rattling around in his head as his dogged determination is undermined by crippling migraines, disconcerting memories of his recently dead wife Dolores (played with a detached coolness by Michelle Williams) and haunting visions of the horrific scenes he witnessed during wartime. The asylum staff and the patients are equally edgy and disturbing - almost comically sinister, so are the twin leaders of the clinical staff: the courteous but steely Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and the ironic, provocative German, Dr Naehring (Max von Sydow). The paranoid marshal's fractured psyche soon begins to unravel a web of lies and conspiracy as the storm rages outside, and a succession of curious encounters suggest the sanatorium is being used for noxious experiments by the federal government in furtherance of the cold war, and he has been drawn there as an intended victim. But as Teddy's nightmares become indistinguishable from reality, we get a brilliantly constructed psychological thriller that threatens to upend our protagonist's grasp on veracity.What starts as a locked-room crackerjack mystery soon transforms into a trippy, psychological freak-out as doubts are cast over our protagonists sanity, with enough red herrings and unexpected twists to keep the mind engaged - eager for the next surprise. What Martin Scorsese does best is set the mood, an atmosphere of impending doom. Based on a tightly plotted, willfully schlocky pulp thriller that novelist Dennis Lehane penned, Scorsese injects the movie with an air of ambiguity - every moment is charged with suggestion and, frankly, insanity - forcing you to pay attention. As you are wrapped up in the wonderful characters, disturbing pathos, and taut pacing, Scorsese has fun indulging his cinematic sleight of hand. Scorsese packs the film with so many thrilling details, surreal asides and masterful set-ups that we can't help but enjoy the ride. And the cast is having fun as well, diving into their characters and ladling on the innuendo with arched eyebrows and shifty glances.Resembling a psychotropic reverie or unhinged fever dream, Shutter Island finds Martin Scorsese at his most technically accomplished as he triumphs with a powerful noir pastiche that sends the audience into a world of psychosis and paranoia. A luridly enjoyable ride!",9,1,3,26 April 2015
"Monsters, Inc."," The 'Monsters' at Pixar Scare Up a Laugh!
","In the extra-dimensional city of Monstropolis, the power grid runs on the screams of human children, caused and captured by the (otherwise perfectly friendly) monsters who creep through their closets every night. The motto at Monsters Inc. is simple and endearing –'We scare because we care'. Sulley (perfectly voiced by John Goodman) is a large monster who is able to scare children by walking into their bedroom late at night and exposing his vicious teeth and frightening scream. The perfect comic foil to Sulley, Mike (Billy Crystal, spot-on) is the guy who keeps his pal in tip top scaring shape - ordering up the closet doors that the monsters go through to frighten children, whose screams are bottled and converted to the energy that keeps the monsters' world, and Monsters, Inc., going.As the story in 'Monsters Inc.' continues, a tiny tot nicknamed Boo refuses to be scared and sneaks through the portal into the world of the monsters. Ironically, the burbling, giggling, 'Kitty' shrieking tyke scares the dickens out of monsters, as much as our amiable monsters scare little kids. It is now left up to expert 'scarer' Sully and his one-eyed pal Mike to put Boo back where she belongs and restore order to the universe before the Child Detection Agency can get wind of their mistake.Like every Pixar film, 'Monsters Inc.' is crammed with intricate and subtle details, but the tortuous storyline is laid out so flawlessly that even broods have no problem keeping up. The admirable oddness of its plot — affable creatures harvest children's screams via an inter-dimensional network of cupboards — may now be softened by familiarity, yet it remains as fresh as ever. Laughs are earned throughout this heart-warming story that never engages in the potty humor that so often undercuts these films - the interplay between Sully and Mike results in jokes which feel wholly unexpected and off-the-cuff. But it's in the visuals that 'Monsters Inc.' really comes to life, from the decor each child has on his closet door to the vast variations of monsters on the job on the 'scare floor' – blobs, giant spiders, lizards, snakes and goblins right up to the dizzying finale, set in a seemingly infinite warehouse of doors, each of which opens on a different bedroom in a different part of the world.Successfully combining intimacy with a sprawling alt-universe world, marrying a gentle character comedy to a slam-bang chase finish - this is exactly what Pixar is so celebrated for. While successfully marrying all of this to jaw-dropping technology, the monsters at Pixar scare up a laugh!",9,0,1,14 December 2015
Rush," Ron Howard's Thrill-Ride will Give You an Adrenaline 'Rush'!
","There's been a lot of hype surrounding director Ron Howard's last venture into the world of Formula One racing starring Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl. It's safe to report that 'Rush' is a thrill ride that will leave you entertained from moment one.Rush tells the true story of a single season of Formula One racing in 1976 featuring the intense rivalry between playboy superstar James Hunt (Hemsworth) and science-focused misanthrope Niki Lauda (Brühl). The film progresses as the two work pit their dichotomy of passions for racing against one another on a world stage that eventually leads to Lauda's near-fatal accident and subsequent return to the competition. It's the battle of the Formula One alpha males as the real-life rivalry between the hard-nosed Austrian and the British playboy is given full, glorious vent in Ron Howard's exciting car-race movie.While Howard follows both men's romantic lives, the focus is really on the love-hate relationship between two bitter adversaries who can't help admiring each other. And what a relationship! It's a duel of dualism, with audiences leaning into the corners to decide whether to ally themselves with Hunt's hedonism or Lauda's hard-headedness. Howard's triumph is that the choice is never an easy one. Howard has a way of wringing human tension from a story even if you have no great interest in or knowledge of the setting. Apollo 13 was set in space; Cinderella Man was (and yet wasn't) about boxing; and Rush mines the noisy, gasoline-and-testosterone world of the Formula 1 circuit in ways that even non-gearheads can get their heads around. As well as brandishing his usual mastery for pacing gutsy dramas, Howard's command over his division of digital artists results in some great sequences once the action moves to the track – the recreation of Lauda's fatal crash is stunning! What helps the film move along, are the impressive turns by the two leads. Chris Hemsworth is very convincing as the flaky, womanizing Brit who puts fun before everything else. Fascinating and layered deep with a silence under the glitz and glamor, James Hunt was a lonely person. Hemsworth illustrates all of it with a light sensitivity and a charismatic nature. Daniel Brühl fully understands the mechanics and precise ways of Niki Lauda. Serious to a fault, his Lauda is a study in straight talk, calculated risk taking and common sense, qualities that often put him at odds with everybody else. Bruhl gives his character soul with the occasional smile and showing of vulnerability.When seen on the big screen, Rush is an absolute thrill-ride. When the lights went down, my heart-rate was inexorably starting to climb. After about half an hour I was having difficulty breathing. I wasn't the only one. The whole row I was in sounded like an outing of emphysema patients!",9,0,1,15 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Peter Jackson Conjures Up the Most Potent Motion Picture Magic in Years!
","The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a spectacle with the emotional charge of a thunderbolt on a canvas brushed with master strokes. With authority and disarming creative propensity, director Peter Jackson creates mystic illusions borne from J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novel. The result is a marvelous journey, where gentle hobbits, powerful wizards and humans meld with trolls, misshapen orcs, black-cloaked ring-wraiths and Uruk-Hai.In the first chapter The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the magical land of Middle-earth is the fictional setting, but it's no backdrop; it's a living, breathing universe, in which mild-mannered hobbit Frodo Baggins (a brilliant Elijah Wood) is forced to turn hero when he inherits the ring of absolute power - the one that grants long life, invisibility and carries with it the inevitable seduction of evil. Assisted by powerful wizard Gandalf (a perfectly cast Ian McKellen) and a motley fellowship of warriors, he must journey across Middle Earth to return the talisman to its source. Frodo's entourage includes the brooding but valiant ranger Aragorn (a mesmerizing Viggo Mortensen), the scheming but brave Boromir (Sean Bean) and the dashing elfin archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Also along for the adventure are three of Frodo's mischief-making hobbit chums from the Shire. Frodo sets out with this coterie on an epic quest to carry the ring into the core of the vanquished dark lord Sauron's lair, who has been hot on the hunt, to destroy it in the searing fires of Mount Doom.Their journey is fraught with adventure, as the fellowship does extensive battle with all sorts of rogues along the way. Orchestrating all the evil-doing is the fallen wizard Saruman (a marvelously malevolent Christopher Lee), who has gone over to the dark side and battles wits with the cagey old Gandalf. All along the way, there's plenty of soul-searching as Frodo questions his fate and his comrades must fight off the sinister allure of the magical gold ring. And it's in this aspect that Jackson elevates the film beyond mere adventure escapism. He treats the story's metaphorical properties with due gravity, but without falling into turgid sermonizing. He strikes a nice balance of deeper meaning and sheer entertainment.Weighty with Middle-earth lore and eye-dazzling vistas of the storybook Shire, the Elvish town of Rivendell and ravaged land of Mordor; alive with the personalities of jaunty hobbits, toiling gnomes, enchanting elves and dashing warriors, the film is a fine wonder of technical achievement and masterly acting in service of a rich, rousing and meaningful story. The computer-generated images transform the New Zealand locations into views that will take your breath away and only someone with a pathological aversion to fantasy could fail to be absorbed and transported by this stunning, sincere and frequently terrifying adaptation. Cinematically inspiring, the costume, production design, prosthetic body parts and make up are extraordinary in their detail, complete in every way.Peter Jackson does not only attempt the most ambitious film project in modern cinema history, he pulls it off with a breathtaking mixture of nerve and verve, conjuring the most potent major-motion-picture magic in years.",10,2,2,11 January 2016
The Thing," In Carpenter's Masterpiece, 'Thing's Truly are Seldom What They Seem!
","John Carpenter's The Thing is one of those beloved relics of the '80s that was considered a game-changer for creature-features. Viewing the movie thirty years removed from that era, the ideas it presents remain as alarming as ever; this is not a thriller in which ordinary beasts seek to destroy a gathering of unsuspecting victims, but one in which they take on the traits of earthly organisms and walk among them as part of a convincing ruse to adapt to a new foreign environment.Ominously bland shots of the Antarctic profile introduce us to R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell), a pilot with an American research crew who, along with a gathering of other morose men, is about to be involved in one hell of a tricky predicament. The marvelously disconcerting prologue suggests so, of course, as a handsome Alaskan malamute (with a little more sobriety than typically seen in dogs) gallops across the Antarctic tundra, a nearby helicopter full of eager Norwegians pursues it, hoping to shoot the animal dead in its tracks. That grim pursuit takes them right into the base of the American researchers, who respond with confounding resistance. An explosion and an assassination later, the American crew takes the dog in, only to discover too late that appearances can be deceptive. It turns out that the dog is indeed the alien creature that has assumed the guise of a dog. It soon proceeds to infiltrate the unsuspecting crew members of the camp, and the good guys try to figure out which of them may have been compromised. Throughout the course of the movie, a lot of terrible things happen to this ensemble of characters while the monster in its fuzzy new form snuggles up to its fresh banquet of victims. What it does is the unthinkable: consume people and then essentially take on their characteristics, allowing them to move undetected amongst others. When this knowledge is shared with the scientists, ensuing hysteria overwhelms their need for survival, and inevitably the movie becomes a cat-and-mouse game in which it's not just about how to destroy the fiend, but where to find it and who to trust among the ensemble of wary survivors.Carpenter's thriller is a masterful exercise in claustrophobic suspense, far superior to other sloppy efforts that have saturated the market with a relentless supply of bloodthirsty monsters jumping out from the shadows: a peerless masterpiece of retina-wrecking visuals (with remarkable special effects). Carpenter capitalizes on the dramatic possibilities inherent in the contrast between the cramped interiors of the station and the vast expanse of the wintry landscape outside. He uses this disparity to amazing effect to create an atmosphere of testosterone-fueled paranoia. The strong cast brings the somewhat underwritten characters to vivid life.Though are eyes are horrified and our hearts often unsettled, we watch on as if hypnotized by an unfolding nightmare from which there is no turning away!",9,2,6,29 March 2015
The Shining," A Shining Piece in the Top Echelons of Cinema!
","The Shining is a curious motion picture. While Stephen King (on whose novel 'The Shining' the movie is based) was largely ambivalent about the adaptation, for legions of filmaholics, it is an example of directorial bravura and an exemplary study of psychosis and unreliable terror. With its intensely suffocating sense of personality disintegration, The Shining is as unsettling as anything Stanley Kubrick made during his distinguished career.At its core, The Shining is a simple haunted-house story. Jack Torrance (Nicholson) takes up a job at the unbelievably remote Overlook Hotel in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado (a place where many depraved incidents have happened, it has become something of a library of malevolent psychic energy) with his wife Wendy (Duvall) and his son Danny (Lloyd) in tow. They are to spend six and a half months as the winter caretakers for the hotel, separated from the rest of humanity by an unforgiving alpine winter. Jack's personality seems on the edge and we soon learn that he's a recovering alcoholic. Wendy is the kind of meek wife who follows her husband's lead while Danny has a disconcerting habit of conversing with himself, implied to be a manifestation of his psychic powers. Very soon, bizarre occurrences start happening and the movie flails off into an orgy of psychological terror. Wendy becomes concerned that her husband is losing his grip on sanity. And with a winter storm howling outside, the spacious hotel becomes a penitentiary. And the weirdness and danger escalate further as Jack slips over the edge from sanity to madness.Nicholson's centerpiece performance is so absolutely terrifying and raw that it's no wonder he's spent the rest of his career in its shadow. Duvall as the mousy, jangled wife makes the most of her natural wide-eyed innocence, while Lloyd is equally compelling as the young boy who has the gift of the (paranormal) gab. The real star here, however, is Kubrick's direction. Kubrick creates a twisted environment in which mental stability, supernatural malignance and the sense of space and time shimmer and twist to dreadful effect. Kubrick presents much of the movie from Jack's point-of-view, and it becomes apparent that Kubrick wants us to become mired in the maelstrom of his disintegrating sanity. He however, never answers the questions about whether Jack's ghoulish visions are real or fabrications of his increasingly warped imagination, which adds to the eerie discomfort. By the end of the film, every inch of the hotel hints at something sinister and every frame is infused with a sense of the macabre.With Kubrick's majestic fingerprints all over it, The Shining easily finds a place in the top echelons of cinematic achievements. A totally visceral experience!",9,3,6,22 March 2015
American Beauty," In Mendes' Curdled 'American' Dream, 'Beauty' Runs Deep!
","An acerbic, darkly comic critique of how social conventions can lead people into false, sterile and emotionally stunted lives, American Beauty is a real American original.Something's rotten in suburbia and it doesn't take long to get to the source of the stink – the Burnhams. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a middle-aged burnout who is a marginalized husband to efficient, well-scrubbed Carolyn (Annette Benning) and a disregarded father to sullen teenager Jane (Thora Birch) and whose everyday life has degenerated into tedium. Browbeaten Lester is rejuvenated by the vision of a blonde Lolita. That the object of his obsession happens to be his daughter's best friend, a calculating sylph named Angela (Mena Suvari), matters not at all; he leaps into his fantasy like an enflamed teenager. Unhappy Carolyn undertakes an affair of her own while Jane, repulsed by her dad's hormonal attraction, secretly welcomes the attention of Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), the strange, self-possessed boy next door. And just when things seem to be falling in place for the Burnhams, it all comes crashing down. If this sounds too depressing, guess again!Although it's difficult to believe that humor can be found in this toxic portrait of superficial suburban values, predatory sexuality and domestic violence, rest assured it earns its laughs at every turn. Screenwriter Alan Ball gives the viewer a brief, horrific tour of crossed wires, inchoate longing, dashed illusions and resentment that wells from poisoned hearts with staggering self-assuredness. Sam Mendes (in one of the most promising debuts in cinematic history) whips the audience around from humor to horror to something poetic and humane. He suffuses the proceedings with a palpable sense of danger, keeping film-goers unsettled until the very end as to what exactly motivates these complicated characters. But he never loses sight of the humanity behind even the most reprehensible acts, a balancing act pulled off with unusual acumen.American Beauty turns out to be emotionally satisfying, thanks in large part to a remarkably nuanced performance by Kevin Spacey. He commands the screen with a performance of subtlety, vulnerability and supreme confidence, in which he expresses mordant self-mockery and poignancy in a single gesture. He brings flawless comic timing to Lester's self-absorbed, infantile and rapacious behavior while holding on to the pathos of Lester's rage. Benning turns in her finest performance to date and all three teen players give sturdy and courageous portrayals in roles that would daunt actors twice their ages.Visually daring, dramatically astute, and beautifully acted, American Beauty is a tart, funny and tremendously sobering movie about the deepest recesses of personal unhappiness. There's a sense of poignancy at the end, but also the feeling that we have been on an incredible trip through the lives and souls of three perfectly- realized characters. The result is the kind of artful defiance that Hollywood is usually too timid to deliver: a jolting comedy that makes you laugh till it hurts!",10,2,3,13 April 2015
Apocalypse Now," Francis Ford Coppola Lays Bare 'The Horror' of Combat!
","With a famously horrific shoot, it's now almost unfathomable how Francis Ford Coppola managed to harness the chaotic energy into one of the most potent examinations of war and masculinity to ever grace celluloid in his masterpiece Apocalypse Now.The story, based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, centers on Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), a US Army intelligence officer with a mission to travel into Cambodia and terminate the command of the renegade Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) - a colonel who went crazy and went native, forming his own Montagnard army out in the darkness of the jungle.. Needing to get back in the game, Willard takes the mission and finds himself among a motley crew. Nobody on the boat really understands the mission, least of all Willard himself, who keeps squinting at Kurtz's dossier and marveling at what a model soldier he was. Perhaps Kurtz hasn't gone rogue; perhaps he has simply achieved military apotheosis, carrying out the logical extension of the armed forces. Along the way he bonds with the crew of the boat taking him up-river as they encounter a gung-ho surfing Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), a sexy French woman, a few Playboy Bunnies, a free-wheeling journalist and more war-time horrors than they could have imagined, until he finally meets Colonel Kurtz. This epic dark fantasia ends on a rather elliptical note, which seems the only way for it to end.'Apocalypse Now' is a confounding mix of the conventional and the surreal, a man-on-a-mission war flick that expands into a meditation. There is greatness to it, but there is also madness, and they feed off each other. From its opening scene of Capt. Willard falling apart in a Saigon hotel, the movie is a nightmare trip into the darkest reaches of the human soul. The depth and audacity of Mr. Coppola's vision makes even the most ambitious of today's films look timid and dreary by comparison. His direction is impeccable, capturing both the intimate detail, overarching spectacle and layered depth of meaning, often all in one shot and thus delivering a harrowing masterwork that bursts with malarial, mystical images. The movie is stunningly beautiful to look at, remarkably moving and horrific, and jammed with memorable characters in unforgettable situations. The score is wondrous, the production design solid and never overdone, and the cinematography is just wow.On the acting front, Martin Sheen brings astonishing sincerity to Willard and is entirely believable as the cipher, the burned-out husk who's seen too much death to be at peace. Robert Duvall's brilliant turn as Col. Kilgore - a near-cartoonish hawk who lives and breathes war, rings with bracing energy. But the movie ultimately belongs to the maestro himself – Marlon Brando. In a role that has all off 15 minutes of screen time - most of which is spent mumbling in the shadows, delivering hipster rants about atrocities – Brando is extraordinary as the great bald shambling mountain, who both does and doesn't seem to be the monster we've been waiting for.By any standard, Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece, a towering achievement of sight and sound - an epic freak-out, a fever dream of immense proportions, laying bare the stark horror and unimaginable thrill of combat.",9,1,3,2 February 2016
Ratatouille," Place Your Order Now for Ratatouille is Delectable!
","I could go on for hours about the delights of Ratatouille. The animation is superb, the vocals flawless, the script witty, the central dilemma between family ties and the pursuit of excellence subtly handled. Its jokes (all of them brilliant), its conflict (all of it rousing), its every move springs from this simple fact: Ratatouille has heart. Wisely returning to form after the lackluster Cars, the story is delightfully ludicrous. Born with an acute sense of smell and taste, young Remy, a Parisian rat (Patton Oswalt) squirms at the idea of eating moldy crusts and soggy table scraps. He's acquired a taste for the finer things largely thanks to his favorite gastronome Chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett), who's crafted a career and a five-star establishment from his copy written tagline: 'Anyone can cook!' His sole pleasure is food and he dreams of culinary glory working as a fine French chef, but needs a front man who won't cause screams in the kitchen. He soon hooks up with the timid scullery hand Linguini (Lou Romano), a garbage boy with no noticeable gustatory talent who's willing to play puppet to Remy's puppeteer in order to keep his job and, secretly, to pursue a pretty sous-chef. Out to nail the new mystery chef is a pallid, joyless food critic, Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) who is irate that an establishment he has relegated to the lower echelons is making a comeback.Verging on the surreal - if not downright psychedelic - Ratatouille takes place in a highly believable universe that looks and behaves a lot like our own. In the world of Ratatouille, as in ours, rats are gross, humans are boss and cross-species tolerance is a dream. But Brad Bird gives us the most distasteful setup imaginable – Rats in the kitchen! Not only touching the food, but preparing it - and turns it around into something absolutely delectable. You expect kitchen slapstick; you get something that's closer to kitchen ballet, with food so seductively animated you can tell stale bread from fresh. More than that, you get a story with real strum and a lot of heart. Patton Oswalt lends a certain degree of vulnerability and sympathy to the main character, and the supporting cast of Brad Garrett and John Ratzenberger fill out the film well. Peter O'Toole is sublimely sneering as the ominous food critic Anton Ego. Ratatouille is an intricate dish, infused with energetic and amusing story lines that are all fully cooked and complementary to the film's rich visual look. Bring your hardiest appetite. Ratatouille is immensely satisfying!",10,0,1,23 March 2015
Aliens," James Cameron's Unmistakable Mastery Makes 'Aliens' a Consummate Fright-Fest!
","'Aliens', the sequel to Ridley Scott's eerie space thriller, is a high-tech, souped-up war movie - a rare instance where a follow-up deviates from the formula and finds an effective rhythm in propelling the story.Having overcome a terrifying alien predator, Ripley (a fantastic Sigourney Weaver in her best performance of the series) is found drifting through space in a life-pod by a salvage ship and brought back to a space station, where Burke, a representative of The Company, tells her that she has been unconscious for 57 years. To her horror, Ripley also learns that the planet on which she and her crew found the creature in 'Alien' has been colonized. It isn't long, however, until Burke tells her that they've lost contact with the colony (a series of scenes involving those colonists confronting a mysterious spacecraft shows us that Ripley's worst fears are realized: the alien life forms have reappeared) and asks her to accompany a platoon of colonial marines to the planet as an adviser. She's sent in with a crack squad of marines and hurtles headlong into a hi-tech house of horrors that delivers plenty of shocks and nail-biting suspense.Once the marines land, the film becomes a feast of fights and special effects, from the high-tech weaponry of the marines to the aliens themselves. But 'Aliens' wisely never allows its admittedly eye-catching and inventive gizmos to control the film. Rather, they provide striking punctuation! It's almost all suspense-building, as it expertly draws out the audience's mounting anxiety. For well over two hours, the audience sits transfixed in a web of despair, and around every corner there exists a bleak reality that never lets up, even in brief moments where an upper hand seems within reach. Consider this: The first full-grown alien does not appear until after the one-hour mark as the full figure of the alien eludes full photographic exposure during many of the confrontations, and that only adds to the adrenaline. We may know what it looks like based on past experience, but who is to say they have not evolved.James Cameron's sense of precision allows the movie to make distinctive departures from its predecessor. Ridley Scott was the right director to make a movie as cautious and observing as 'Alien', but it took a man with great nerve to concoct a follow-up that could amp up the adrenaline beyond simple passages of action. Masterfully controlling the tension and moving the involving plot at a lightning pace, Cameron exploits everyone's worst fears and carries them to the riveting extreme in this consummate fright-fest. Where most horror films goose the gore quotient to elicit excitement from audiences, the visceral nature of Aliens is tempered so as not to override the main thrust of the story.Thanks to him, Aliens proves to be a tightly constructed yarn that has no problem keeping its audience's attention rapt. It is visceral entertainment!",9,1,2,24 August 2015
The Exorcist," Decades Later, The Exorcist Still Scares the Devil Out of You!
","Set in Georgetown, The Exorcist narrates the tale of a glamorous household in the neighborhood, where the 12 year old daughter Regan (Linda Blair) of a popular actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) begins to exhibit bizarre behavior and suddenly grows sullen and incredibly foul-mouthed, leading to her transformation into a deformed and dangerous imitation of herself - a scar-faced, burning- eyed, profanity-spewing monster. After numerous medical examinations come up with no explanation for her condition, Chris in desperation turns to exorcism and a Jesuit priest Damien Karras (Jason Miller) who is going through a crisis of faith, must determine if the child is in fact possessed and requires an exorcism. After learning about the case from Chris and avuncular police detective Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) and after seeing Regan's head-whirling, crucifix- abusing, green vomit routines, he is convinced that inhabiting poor Regan's body is none other than the devil himself and calls in an elderly, experienced exorcist, Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow). The core of the movie is Regan's subsequent exorcism, so cold that plumes of frost expel with every breath and so rancid with terror that audiences even today tremble at the sight.This jolting tale of a 12-year-old girl possessed by the devil might sound like your run-of-the-mill horror movie, but The Exorcist, with its hypnotic narrative grip, deepens the emotional pool. Based upon the acclaimed 'true life' novel by William Peter Blatty, who in turn adapted it into a screenplay; it was brought to life with uncompromising force by director William Friedkin, going all out in this portrayal of purity possessed by demonic forces. Here, Friedkin does not rush the proceedings, but rather he takes his time establishing mood, character, and heart thumping suspense which leads to some truly terrifying and effective scares - a bloody medical procedure, the sight of putrefying flesh, a blasphemous child stabbing her crotch with a crucifix; the subsequent 180 degree swiveling of her head; and a spider walk down a staircase which concludes with a blood curling scream. Today, it's not only a pop-culture conversation piece but a bona- fide classic, a finely crafted thriller that benefits immensely from its controlled direction, a thematically fruitful script, startling makeup designs, amazing special effects, an eerie score and an incredible cast that registers uniformly bravura performances. Its philosophical slant drives a deep wedge between it and other films of its ilk, which do not have the intelligence or substance to tackle such themes, as this movie so cleverly does. For this reason, The Exorcist not only tops the horror genre but transcends it, resulting in a profound experience. Decades later, it continues to exert its demonic spell!",9,3,5,16 April 2015
American History X," American History X is A Harrowing Morality Tale!
","Make no mistake; American History X is not pretty. It's not fun. It made me squirm and cringe. Not because it was bad, but because it's powerful stuff - a refreshing change from the usual saccharine attempts by Hollywood to address racism, giving us a brilliant tale told without restraint or bias.The movie begins on the day former leader of a neo-Nazi skinhead gang Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) gets out of prison after serving a 3- year sentence for the vicious manslaughter of black thieves who were trying to steal his truck. The incident in question was the culmination of Derek's indoctrination as a white supremacist, begun in the lessons of his father who was slain at the hands of black men, and picked up by Venice Beach's white-power kingpin Cameron. Derek's high-flying stardom within the latter's organization crashes in prison, where Derek slowly learns the error of his ways and builds a resolve to keep his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from following in his footsteps. He comes home to find that his brother has succumbed to the rancorous influence of the same hate- group who turned him into a skinhead thug.Meanwhile, at school, Danny must rewrite a paper for his history class because the glowing essay he wrote on Mein Kampf - at Cameron's urging - was rejected. He is ordered by his high school principal Dr. Sweeney to instead write a report on his brother and his own journey into the twisted skinhead world titled 'American History X'. Derek is the star of Danny's account, and Derek's transformation is revealed in black and white flashbacks when he recounts to Danny about his prison ordeal - his disillusionment with other skinhead inmates, their revenge on him and his unexpected friendship with a black convict. Danny slowly comes to realize the truth - the venom spewed by Cameron and his ilk creates nothing but misery. In the end, though, there is no escaping the price for Derek's sins. American History X is deceptively simple in its story telling, but first-time director Tony Kaye directs it like an auteur, giving us a harrowing morality tale that is both rich and gripping at all times. But it is Edward Norton's riveting performance as a smart kid seduced by horrible ideas that makes the story real. He plays the raging neo-Nazi with unsettling conviction, spitting hateful propaganda and brutally letting his feelings out. Edward Furlong's performance as Danny shows an impressive range for a young actor, making Danny a believable teenager.When Edward Norton's brilliant, fully rounded performance rubs up against the film's grainy toughness - complimented by an impressive, gut-wrenching screenplay - American History X becomes an exhilarating experience.",10,1,2,27 April 2015
The Usual Suspects," Nothing Remotely 'Usual' about It!
","The irony here is that nothing is remotely 'usual' about The Usual Suspects. The plot is a Chinese puzzle box of a thriller.Roger 'Verbal' Kint, a crippled con man (Kevin Spacey), is one of two survivors of a massacre and ship-burning on a south Los Angeles pier. Before Verbal can be questioned in full, he's offered immunity. Something's up, and customs agent David Kujan has only a few hours to talk to Verbal. Through their informal talk, a story is revealed: Five top-of-the-line criminals (including Kint) are picked up for an NYPD lineup as suspects in a hijacking incident. According to Kint, the quintet, angry about the lineup, join forces to heist an illegal operation for Keyser Soze, who is supposedly the one pulling the strings all along - a fiend incarnate, he says. As the Los Angeles police start their own investigation, Verbal runs Kujan through the hoops, an interplay as exciting as an action sequence. And thus starts the labyrinthine story!What sets The Usual Suspects apart from the crowd is the striking intensity of the performances, the show-off brilliance of the dialog and the diabolical complexity of the plot directed to perfection by the then relatively new Bryan Singer. Singer's sensationally assured direction exerts a riptide pull. He along with screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie, have plenty of surprises up their collective sleeve, breathing new life into the heist-noir genre. Also, he gives us the character of Keyser Soze - a faceless yet discernible movie element - so enthralling and sinister; it will crop up in pop culture references for years. The Usual Suspects is acted to sweet perfection with an absolutely riveting centerpiece performance by Kevin Spacey. A terrific supporting cast of exciting actors socks over this absorbingly complicated yarn that's been spun in seductively slick fashion.A whammy of a surprise ending makes you want to see the film again to see if Singer pulled a few fast ones to make the pieces fit. The Usual Suspects is an entertaining mystery with plenty of nerve and vigor. A must watch!",10,1,3,23 March 2015
Inside Out," Inside Out, Upside Down or Sideways, Pixar's Latest is An 'Emotional' Thrill Ride!
","It's old hat to call a movie an 'emotional thrill ride,' but in Inside Out, it's literally true, as the abstract concepts of our minds prove to be the perfect playground for the Pixar pixelators.The opening scenes of Inside Out skillfully introduce the characters while generating a sense of joy at the wonders of the world, as a little girl named Riley is born in Minnesota and starts to grow. But unlike other animated movies, Riley is not the hero of the film. The principal characters are the primary emotions in her head: permanently buoyant, yellow-hued emoticon-Tinkerbell hybrid – Joy; fiery red, pugnacious, his fuse as short as his sleeves – Anger; bespectacled blue blob beneath owlish spectacles – Sadness; chic, fastidious and disdainful green - Disgust and a bow-tie wearing purplish bag-of-nerves with startled eyebrows that levitate above his head - Fear. Together they guide Riley's feelings from a knob-laden control desk, processing her new memories as they arrive at the Head-quarters, each memory looking like a glowing bowling ball and colored according to mood. Some of her experiences become important, influential long-term memories and are stored as color-coded orbs; others are dumped into the vast wasteland of forgotten experiences.In the idyll of childhood, it's the ever ebullient Joy, naturally, who takes the lead at the console. But childhood bliss cannot last forever. Riley is uprooted from Minnesota to San Francisco when her father takes another job and the turmoil of the move to a new home leaves Riley coping with everything from living in a less-than-desirable neighborhood to missing her friends to feeling like an outcast at her new school. Things are getting complicated inside Riley Central! This soon triggers a crisis as a control-room malfunction leaves Joy and Sadness stranded in a vast allegorical geography of Riley's mind-scape. And so begins an odyssey through her psyche, as they traverse such wonderfully rendered obstacles as a library of memory banks and an imaginary friend - unbearably tragi-cute Bing Bong. Can Joy and Sadness make it back to headquarters in time, before a dejected Riley runs away from home?Emotions run wildly funny in this exceedingly original story. But what's most brilliant about the Inside Out is how director Pete Docter not only connects beautifully to those emotions but turns them into his characters. The story takes us outside Riley's mind and into the real world just often enough for us to appreciate what she's going through. It's all done with a deft touch. Working with a multi-layered story and a sparkling voice-cast, Inside Out comes with a surprising amount of depth, resulting in a film that is not only delightfully entertaining, but also thought-provoking and very much emotionally-complex.Pixar has always been great at coaxing our eyeballs out of our fat heads with awe-inspiring visuals and vibrant colors, but Inside Out is undoubtedly the studio's most impressive piece of eye-candy yet. They outdo themselves with vast, intricate, amazingly detailed landscapes ranging from the 'movie studio' where Riley's dreams are produced every night to the places where Riley's subconscious and abstract thinking reside, all brimming with sparkling visuals. The running gags are all delicious (don't miss the end credits) and keep flying in thick and fast.Fittingly for a movie set inside someone's head, Pixar's latest is a fireworks display of fizzing ideas and bursts of imagination. Poignant, heartfelt, and endearing, Pixar's latest outing challenges us all to dream, to feel, to be!",10,19,57,25 August 2015
The Pianist," Roman Polanski Renders 'The Pianist' Like A Melancholy Poetry!
","Truth can be and often is stranger than fiction and so it is with the true story of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who through sheer nerve and luck managed to escape the clutches of the uber-efficient Nazi death machine. Szpilman before the war was a nationally renowned musician. At the start of the film, he's playing Chopin on Polish radio just as World War II begins and bombs drop all around the radio studio, knocking it off the air, and knocking Szpilman's life into a downward spiral. Little by little, Szpilman and his family are subjected to the Nazi process of separating the Jewish population of Warsaw from the rest of the inhabitants. Starting with restaurants and parks being closed to them, they are forced from upper middle-class security into life in the arm-banded ghetto to their final journey on the train where they herded as less compromising compatriots into the rolling pens of death. Just when the audience is on the verge of becoming numbed by the grim life in the ghetto, the pianist, through quirks of fate, is spared the death camps, only to go into hiding in abandoned apartments, trusting sympathetic Poles to protect him in a world where an act of kindness can be a death sentence. Szpilman becomes a voyeur to the horror he witnesses through windows and half-closed doors that lead to a world that has become a death trap. Battles rage, Nazis march, and civilians are mowed down as he watches helplessly. Just when the Nazi brutality against the Jews seems unbearable, a music-loving German soldier treats the pianist kindly while Jewish victims prey on each other.The Pianist is rendered with a melancholy poetry by Roman Polanski. His depiction of life in the Warsaw Ghetto is a series of disturbing images framed with a sense of urgency. However, these images don't need any melodramatic embellishment. And in this way, Polanski ensures he is not cheapening the story by appealing to our pity. What he has this film ask of us is to bear witness that such things happened in a civilized place, to never forget that they can and do happen still. And yet amid the usual roster of sadism, there are notes of unexpected poignancy that tug at your heart strings. The scene where Szpilman climbs over the wall and is walking through a veritable waste land of destroyed buildings is a powerfully quiet, cold image of death.The muted heroism of Szpilman's survival flashes as a fragile and determined pulse in Adrien Brody's magnificently understated performance. As Szpilman, he brilliantly echoes the film's tone of stunned disbelief, as a series of events transforms him from an elegantly dressed, highly cultured musician to a scavenging, debased shell of a human being. His performance is a marvel of wary tenacity and unquenchable humanity.The Pianist is an emotionally devastating film that will linger in the minds of all who experience it; the notion that war is the absence of art in our dealings with one another will remain as timeless as a well-written phrase.",9,0,0,24 August 2015
City of God," 'City of God' is A Place Where Life is Cheap, But Humanity is Richly Vibrant!
","Brazillian director Fernando Meirelles' splashy feature debut is a dynamically exciting portrait of Rio de Janeiro's violent gangs - a blood-spattered, non-stop ride as much into the life of a 'favela' (squatter settlement) as it is into the lives of the youths who inhabit it.The methodically constructed screenplay is narrated with subjective clarity by Rocket, a young aspiring photographer caught between his deadly surroundings and his treasured sense of ambition. The movie's principal characters, growing up in the Brazilian slum 'Cidade de Deus' in the 60's, are a bunch of drug-peddling, gun-toting hoods hell-bent on revenge - with the notable exception of Rocket, who would rather aim a camera than a shotgun. But Rocket's tale is only one of the dozens of stories 'City of God' juggles with equal aplomb. From the breakneck opening involving a chicken on the lam, the film throbs with several stories: two and a half hours fly by fast and bloody. There's Knockout Ned, a quiet ex-soldier who believes that education and honest work will get him out of the slum. There's Li'l Ze, a vicious drug kingpin with a frozen heart, who erases the Tender Trio's early thug-life template with a psychotically itchy trigger finger. There's Benny, the grooviest hood in the slum, who attempts to retire from Ze's drug game and then there's the hood with my favorite moniker, Steak'nFries, all locked into a headlong dance of sex, drugs, and violence.City of God is an unmissable cinematic triumph, peopled with affecting characters that avoid cliché, and a familiar story signposted with brutally shocking punctuation. Basing the story on real events and people, the makers employ a host of young non-professional actors residing in the slums where the story takes place, who perform a spectacular job under Fernando Meirelles' brilliant direction. Meirelles illuminates every frame of this fresh, ferocious and indelibly moving film that moves at whiplash velocity thanks to a terse script. He endows each chapter with powerful, uncompromising, beguiling and, sometimes, deceptive momentum. In a film of battering audacity, no shock hits harder than the way Meirelles choreographs murder to a dance beat, an exuberant form of kiddie recreation.But for all of the story's violent subject matter, there is also much natural beauty to savor thanks to the dynamic cinematography that captures Brazil's magnificent landscape. Every aspect of the filmmaking exists as a virtuosic symphony of theme, character, context, and style. The style is all dazzle and in-your-face pizazz, quick titles, cuts, and digressions, split screens and smash zooms, while a remarkably complex story unfolds and the funky soundtrack grooves along - all that dazzle serves a purpose.To watch 'City of God' is to become submersed in a hidden culture where life is cheap but the humanity is vibrant. It is a devastating epic about the roots of criminality and the ironic cruelties of life that also works as an intimate personal drama.",10,2,4,8 February 2016
Gone Girl," Marriages are Made in Heaven? Not in David Fincher's Universe!
","The problem with Gone Girl, David Fincher's first rate adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel, is that there's relatively little one can say about the film's gnarly plot without giving away the twists. So I'll step lightly over the plot synopsis.On the day of his fifth wedding anniversary to Amy (Pike), Nick Dunne (Affleck) returns to their small-town Missouri home to find signs of a violent struggle and his wife missing. The police arrive on the 'bit-too-arranged' crime scene to find specks of her blood, as the search fast gains national attention, with the media circus rolling into town in a frenzy of crass curiosity. The more the cops investigate, the worse it looks for Nick as his responses are unfairly interpreted as too cold to be genuine outpourings of grief. The noose is slowly tightening around Nick, who it turns out is harboring a few secrets of his own. Despite his best efforts to appear sympathetic in front of the cops, the cameras and the court of public opinion, Nick can't help coming off as insincere and smug. But a mid-film twist turns the movie from complex whodunit into a psychological thriller. The shift doesn't come entirely out of nowhere and in spite of the tonal shift, everything feels naturally derived, taking us from sympathy to revulsion and back again to sympathy for the central protagonist. Gone Girl bounces back and forth seamlessly from the investigation and the attendant media circus to the horrific dissolution of a fairy tale union. The audience is always kept one step ahead of the characters thanks to extracts from Amy's diaries and a series of flashbacks, which show that a once-idyllic marriage founded on sizzling mutual attraction has begun to flounder on acidic mutual disdain. The storyline itself is pure pulp – a twisting, lurid crime tale with uncannily familiar elements. But in the hands of an immaculate craftsman like Fincher, Gone Girl is a sleek work of art that polishes its literary source, leaving all of the story's vitriol and venom intact. The black humor of the film consistently bites as it spews bile all over the sanctity of marriage. Fincher orchestrates the drama beautifully, providing the film with a steady, unhurried pace that proves perversely effective as it starts to shred the audience's abraded nerves.The lead actors have a palpable chemistry that helps construct the narrative of two loving individuals crumbling under the weight of marital infidelity. Ben Affleck's self-conscious presence translates into an indispensable part of his character, imbuing Nick with an ambivalence that leaves us uncertain about whether we should be cheering or booing him, even when the narrative is ready to throw him to the wolves. Rosamund Pike leaves nothing behind, delving full throttle into an iconic performance as Amy. She uses her cool exterior to mask a seething lump of volatility - an intoxicating blend of slow burn and volcanic flash – that makes her an overwhelming presence. The supporting cast also delivers wonderfully realized performances.David Fincher's graceful cynicism proves to be the perfect channel for this comedic tale of moral decay that remains one of cinema's most supremely cynical statements about the institution of marriage.",9,1,2,5 May 2015
Django Unchained," Tarantino Becomes a Slave to His Self-Indulgence to Give Us a Boisterous Blaxploitation Tale!
","Quentin Tarantino's Spaghetti Western-with-a-dash-of-blaxploitation, Django Unchained, is obscurely referential, extremely indulgent, and deliriously over-the-top; in other words it is the kind of shrewd, eyebrow-raising bombast we've come to expect from Tarantino.Set in 1858, the film opens on a foggy, frigid night as a yet-not- unchained Django (a relentlessly convincing Jamie Foxx, giving his character an undercurrent of cold fury) trudges through the woods with a group of fellow slaves. The company encounters Dr. King Schultz (an endearing Christoph Waltz), an unerringly polite and cheerful German-born bounty hunter, who soon enlists Django to help him hunt down a trio of fugitive scumbags, as he is the only one who can reliably identify them. It's only a matter of time before the pair is cutting a bloody trail through slavers, clansmen, and outlaws, as they journey to reunite Django with his wife Broomhilda (an earnest Kerry Washington). He finds her under the oppressive thumb of the smarmy Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio, zealous in his villainy), owner of the lucrative Candyland Plantation. It is here that Waltz and Django plot their most daring ruse, a complex plot to trick Candie into letting them ride off with Broomhilda, with no strings attached. Little do they know, they have an even tougher nut than Candie to crack - his mentoring house slave, Stephen (a bald, almost unrecognizable Samuel Jackson with a creepy, cobra-like menace).This is meant to be Django's tale, as we see him grow from a shackled slave to trained killer to strategic mastermind, but it becomes clear early on that this isn't Django's story â€“ It is Tarantino's! The godfather of modern gonzo filmmaking addresses American slavery and race relations the same way he has addressed other sensitive issues: by making a boisterously entertaining movie that couldn't be less interested in sensitivity. He wraps the premise of revenge in a cloak of prominent historical injustice, which gives him a certain boundless freedom in adding weight to the payoff of vengeance being served in a manner that is fitting for the antagonists. The film does suffer from a more relaxed style of editing (at 165 minutes) towards the third act, but those are minor quibbles. Django Unchained is a big, sprawling statement that throws everything at the wall and sees what sticks, which has always been one of the strengths of Quentin Tarantino. It is brazen, audacious and thrilling with every concept it dabbles in, and its actors seem to wander through the director's spaces as if consumed by the joyous implications of his overstated enthusiasm for the material, making it engaging on a visceral level.",9,0,3,30 April 2015
Schindler's List," Right at the Top of My List!
","In Schindler's List, we see images that we never thought we would ever see in a non-documentary film. It will kick you in the stomach and not stop until you can't take anymore. It will twist your finger and force you to open your eyes and take in things you would hope to never see in your whole life.The movie follows the story of Oskar Schindler, an entrepreneur who exploits Krakow Jews, only to later become their friend and redeemer. He keeps thousands of them in his factory and out of the camps while challenging and manipulating the venomous S.S. officer Amon Goeth with the help of his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern. During its 195 minutes runtime, Schindler undergoes a subtle transformation, from a self-indulgent exploiter of slave labor to savior with a mission and finally to a hero in hiding.Shot entirely in black and white, Schindler's List is certainly the most intense and uncompromising depiction of the Nazi horror ever to appear in a fiction film. Steven Spielberg directs this poignant drama with an incredible amount of uplifting hope, once again underlining the undeniable splendor of his craft. The detached reticence with which Spielberg captures the Nazis' savagery only adds to that effect. He does not use one trite shot, one forced tear-jerking assemblage. Tears are evoked, but honorably! Initially, the absence of color (with the exception of one haunting, recurring figure) may seem to spare us the gore. But it has the opposite effect: When a guard shoots a kneeling man in the back of the head, the black blood that oozes out is even more unsettling.Headlining the magnificent cast is the hitherto underrated Liam Neeson who inhabits Schindler with such authority that you cannot envisage any other actor do justice to this 'role of a lifetime'. Ralph Fiennes is simultaneously terrifying and fascinating as the S.S. Officer Amon Goeth. Watch him muse to his Jewish mistress 'I realize that you are not a person in the strictest sense of the word' and you will be convinced how Fiennes was clearly robbed off his Oscar. The other key part is Schindler's Jewish accountant, played with self-effacing brilliance by Ben Kingsley, who lends the movie just the right amount of warmth.Marked by a brilliant screenplay and an attitude toward the traumatic subject matter that is both passionately felt and impressively restrained, this is the film to win over Spielberg skeptics.",10,9,13,18 March 2015
The Incredibles," 'The Incredibles' Lives Up to Its Title!
","The Incredibles follows the adventures of reluctantly retired family of superheroes who rediscover the source of their powers – in one another. Bob Farr (Mr. Incredible, voiced by Craig T. Nelson) is one of the world's top superheroes, who makes a living by fighting evil and saving lives on a daily basis. But soon, he is toppled from superhero greatness, his life stolen and his soul crushed. When a man is saved by Mr. Incredible during a suicide attempt, he turns around and sues his masked rescuer for 'Wrongful Un-Death' - and wins! This opens a floodgate of anti-superhero lawsuits, resulting in the government being forced to place them all in the 'superhero relocation program'.Fifteen years later, Bob and his wife Helen (Elastigirl, voiced by Holly Hunter), a famous former superhero in her own right, have been forced to take on civilian identities, in a non-distinct suburban tract house, with their bundles of joy, precociousness, and teen angst. With the exception of a new baby Jack Jack with no discernible powers, the Incredibles are a family of superhero material. Son Dashiell, possesses lightning speed, while teen daughter Violet has the powers of invisibility and force-field generation.The irony is that the Farrs go out of their way to appear normal to the outside world, but they don't enjoy it. Reduced to a soul-crushingly dull job as a clock-punching insurance agent, Bob is now fighting boredom and middle age. However, Mr. Incredible still has the superhero monkey on his back and the only way for him to shake it is for him and his buddy Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) to sneak out on 'bowling night' and look for some crime to fight. Itching for greater action, the sidelined superhero gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top-secret assignment. It doesn't take too long, however, to figure out that there's something wrong. When a new super-villain named Syndrome (Jason Lee) emerges, backed by an army of thugs and a series of giant octopedal killer robots, a return to superherodom is inevitable - only this time, it's not just for Mom and Dad, but the kids can play too.What is most incredible and engaging about The Incredibles is how, well, credible it is. The action sequences are superbly staged, inventive, and exciting, especially the fights with a many-tentacled robot. It's also a very funny movie, hilarious at every level, from school-age snickers to good-natured teen snarkiness to subtle grown-up laughter. The animation is top-notch, as we have come to expect from the wizards at Pixar. The voice cast is uniformly excellent.Well, I could go on, but let's just say that everything in The Incredibles easily lives up to the title. But the highly impressive ocular feast aside, it's the well-crafted script, with genuine emotions conveyed through the characters that make such a lasting impression. Pixar blends funny visuals and amazing superhero action with strong characters and themes that a grown-up can sink their teeth into. Director Brad Bird puts his characters in real peril, keeping the stakes high and propelling The Incredibles far out of the world of 'children's movie'.In a word: it is Incredible!",9,1,2,8 October 2015
Gran Torino," Gran Torino Serves Up A Vintage Clint Eastwood!
","In Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino, he stars as Walt Kowalski, a cantankerous, beer-swilling Korean War veteran and former Ford factory worker who lives in a run-down portion of Detroit ravaged by white flight. Recently widowed, Walt is old-school: He hates his children for driving Japanese trucks and for trying to put him into an assisted-living facility and his grandchildren for their insolence and impropriety. Compounding Walt's loneliness is that he has become a stranger in his hometown; his neighbors all have died or moved away, and a cadre of 'dog-eating' Hmong immigrants has taken their place, whom he incessantly disparages. His gruff demeanor and steady stream of racial epithets make him unsociable for his neighbors.The tension comes to a head when Thao, the teenage boy next door, tries to steal Walt's prized possession - the eponymous Gran Torino, a 1972 vintage Ford automobile - as part of an initiation into a local gang. Unaware that Thao was the would-be thief he chased off the night before, Walt breaks up a fight between the wayward youth and his gangster tormentors that spills onto his yard. Seen as a savior by the Hmong community, he is showered with gifts - much to his displeasure, as they insist that the boy pay for his crime with a lengthy dose of community service under the supervision of Kowalski. Walt reluctantly takes Thao under his wing, and befriends Thao's older sister Sue. The Oriental boy and girl next door make Walt see the good in gooks as we watch this curmudgeonly Scrooge figure open his eyes and mind to the realities of a multicultural America. He quickly discovers he has more in common with his culturally conservative neighbors than his own kin who regard him as an embarrassing dinosaur to be shipped off to a retirement home. However, Gran Torino gradually takes a darker turn and becomes a much more poignant depiction of Kowalski's willingness to seek redemption.Gran Torino is surprisingly funny; as Walt's icy exterior melts away and culture shock leads to wary respect, one can't help but laugh. With a personality as prickly as his looks - flint-eyed squint, sour puss, scruffy hair - he's a bad-ass old coot, who spits his disapproval at the world. It's an idiosyncratic performance that might easily have descended into comedic caricature. But Clint Eastwood somehow pulls it off with profound pathos and bravado. He also directs with his typically sure hand; the plot moves relentlessly forward on his formidable shoulders, assisted by the slyly hilarious dialogues.Gran Torino could have become a tediously pious fable about a racist learning the error of his ways, or - in its final act - an audience- pleasing revenge fantasy. But Eastwood bravely avoids both extremes. Gran Torino is vintage 'Dirty Harry' – Reloaded!",9,2,7,3 May 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," If Revenge is a Dish, Kill Bill Vol.1 is Lip-Smacking Delicious!
","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is Quentin Tarantino's giddy homage to the movies he grew up with—the Hong Kong chop-sockies, the spaghetti Westerns, the Yakuza-samurai actioners, the Japanese anime and the American blaxploitation flicks, reshaped by the writer-director as a sort of reverie of adolescent enthusiasms. The plot has a direct-action vividness suitable for a video game that walks a pretty straight path, especially for a Tarantino film. Cleverly constructed in five labeled chapters, from 'The Blood- Spattered Bride' to 'Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves,' the movie expounds the tale of The Bride (Uma Thurman with the look of a chiseled humanoid, in a physically arduous role) whose rural El Paso wedding is invaded by The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and turned into a bloodbath, leaving her trembling and bloodied. Four years later, rising out of her comatose state, she sets out on an unwavering mission to systematically eliminate her former cohorts one by one, beginning with the now domesticized Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), and the formidable O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), before tracking down Bill (David Carradine), the eponymous focus of her vengeance.Firmly in fan-boy mode here, Tarantino prepares his revenge dish like a skilled chef, chopping and tossing it in an astounding spectacle that's as alluring as the meal itself. And because it's Tarantino, the bloodletting is in full flow. With heads severed and arms lopped off, he pelts us with stylistic jabs even as spouts of red spray the screen. It is a homage all right, but with an extra dollop of ketchup! Tarantino relies on delirious, high-octane camera work, an exhilarating musical soundtrack and wonderfully choreographed sequences (watch O-Ren's origin story told as a spectacularly brutal 7-minute anime or the designed-to-be-legendary showdown between the Bride and the Crazy 88s or the final confrontation between the kimono-clad Ishii and The Bride against the floating snow-flakes) to punch up a story that never loses its intoxicating magnetism. Kill Bill is Tarantino's highly idiosyncratic and deeply personal excursion into a world of movie-inspired unreality. An unapologetic pulp scribe, Tarantino thinks nothing of dropping scores of allusions to the beloved pop culture of his youth into The Bride's universe. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is Tarantino in vintage form!",9,3,8,31 March 2015
The Dark Knight," It Doesn't Get Darker than This!
","'I choose chaos', says the Joker in one of the early scenes in the movie and those words sum up what's in store in The Dark Knight. Directed by the supremely talented Christopher Nolan, The Dark Knight is a masterfully woven tale of anarchy and heroism that captivates you right from the opening scene.The events of The Dark Knight take place a few months from where Batman Begins left off. Gotham City continues to be a lawless frontier where organized crime flourishes but billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is warming to the idea that the city may have found a hero in district attorney Harvey Dent (played by Aaron Eckhart). Enter Heath Ledger as The Joker! Don't let the name cuckold you. This Joker is no circus clown! He has no background and his origins remain a mystery. He is, to be put simply, an anomaly in a world constantly striving to be normal. The Joker does what he does best: unleashing chaos on the streets of Gotham city. Batman on the other hand is trying his best to clean the scum off the streets of Gotham. It is this yin-yang relationship between the caped crusader and his lawless adversary that forms the crux of The Dark Knight.Nolan manages to extract superlative performances from all his cast members. Christian Bale is solid and stoic as our caped crusader. Aaron Eckhart delivers a sterling performance. Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine provide ample support. But it is Heath Ledger, playing the Joker with fire breathing abandon, who indisputably steals the show. Whether it's the opening scene where he's robbing a bank or when he's showing his little magic trick to the mob, Ledger shows how you need to be tightly wound up and totally in control even when delivering a crazy, out-of-control performance. As I had read somewhere – he plays Forrest Gump gone mad, but with élan!To call it the best superhero movie of all time, would be the greatest disservice you could do to the genius of Christopher Nolan. The movie creates a place where good and evil — expected to battle it on — decide instead to get it on and dance. Brilliantly bleak and chillingly Gothic, The Dark Knight soars on the wings of Nolan's savage imagination!",10,1,2,17 March 2015
Life Is Beautiful," In Robert Benigni's Classic, Life is Indeed Beautiful, Regardless of Where It is Lived!
","In his heartrending Holocaust dramedy, Roberto Benigni brilliantly plays Guido, a die-hard romantic in fascist WWII Italy, who falls in love with his idealized incarnation of femininity - Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) - through a series of coincidental and surreptitiously intentional meetings. While Fascist forces grow in power around them, he woos her with magical imagination; so shamelessly sincere in his earthly motivations that at times he seems to levitate while expressing himself. He even rides a horse into her engagement party to rescue her from a loveless union with a hulking fascist bureaucrat, as we witness his romantic honesty transcend every spastic goof he involuntarily makes. In a flash Guido's wish comes true. Guido's marriage to Dora introduces the couple's jovial five- year-old son Joshua (an endearing Giorgio Cantarini) into their 'beautiful life'.But soon the film takes a fearsome turn. Guido, who is Jewish, and his little boy are arrested by the Nazis and the gentile Dora insists on climbing aboard the same train, bound for a concentration camp. From the moment they are arrested, Guido turns his charm and imagination to the desperate task of shielding his son from the truth of their horrific reality. He constructs an elaborate fantasy, convincing the boy that everything is indeed fine and that they are playing a great game, and that all their hardships will earn points that will add up to the ultimate prize – a real tank. Regardless of how much Joshua comes to doubt his father's idyllic framing of the horrors that surround them, Guido never lets down the pretense. In his constant battle to hold his son's imagination, he seems like a knight defending a castle. Humor is the only tool he has to deflect death, torture and the threat of discovery. And that's how Robert Benigni is able to maintain what would seem an improbable balance: the film wins heartfelt laughs through his gentle buffoonery and quick-witted fibs while never once downplaying the inhumane horror of the concentration camp situation. Each laugh comes with the lingering threat of death, which Benigni vividly yet fairly subtly depicts, brilliantly combining slapstick comedy with nuanced social commentary about the Holocaust. He effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. And he draws from this an unpretentious, enormously likable film that plays with history both seriously and mischievously.But what makes Life is Beautiful memorable is not its laughs or sense of reality, but its huge heart - a simple, timeless, uplifting tale of the indomitability of humanity even in the midst of inhumanity. Life Is Beautiful manages to walk the extremely thin line between humor, fantasy, and tragedy with astounding grace.",9,0,1,5 May 2015
Up," Pixar Lifts You 'Up' on the Waves of Visual Bedazzlement!
","Up begins with a poignant montage of our protagonist Carl Fredricksen (the unmistakable voice of Ed Asner) and his partner Ellie as they meet as fledgling broods, only to fall in love. Thrown together by a shared spirit of adventure, particularly the escapades of a spirited explorer Charles Muntz who dazzled the world with his discovery of Paradise Falls, Carl and Ellie are forced to shelve their plans to move to this 'exotic lost land' as life, as always, gets in the way. We watch the couple deal with the ups and downs, joys and tragedies of life; and gradually we watch them grow into old age, Ellie's 'My Adventures' scrapbook still unfilled, even as her time on Earth ends. This wordless, eloquent, effortlessly heart- breaking sequence is sure to melt even the iciest of hearts.With Ellie gone, Carl becomes a crusty codger, faced with moving to retirement home for the rest of his days. But he has another idea, one involving the inflatable leftovers of his previous career as a sidewalk balloon vendor. He decides to honor the promise he made to his dearly departed adventure-loving wife and take one last shot at adventure! Carl hitches thousands of helium balloons to his rickety old house, rigs a steering system and 'Up' he goes. But he is not alone. There's a pint-size accidental stowaway aboard: Russell (an endearing Jordan Nagai as Carl's comic foil), an eight-year-old Wilderness Explorer scout set on earning a badge for assisting the elderly, who happens to be on Carl's porch right when the house takes off. Together they embark on an eventful journey that brings them face to face with unlikely travel companions - both friends and foes in the form of talking dogs, an enormous squawking bird and the reclusive Muntz himself - as they arrive in Paradise Falls. By the end of their escapade, they not only become thick friends, but also learn an invaluable lesson about what really matters most in life; a lesson that imbues Up with a strongly beating heart. Pixar once again outdoes itself with Up, a vibrantly bubbly exploration of how life's great adventures can stem from death's gloomy depths. From a distance, Up may seem to be an old-fashioned adventure story, but filmmakers Pete Docter and Bob Peterson utilize the off-the-wall premise to consistently enthralling effect. The chemistry between Carl and Russell plays a pivotal role here, with the pair's various misadventures heightened by the flamboyant supporting characters and breathtaking visuals. Never has the sight of a thousand balloons looked as glorious as it does here, while the mountains, canyons, and dense forests of its South America bristles with life.Up is so human and relatable that it feels like it's more than just a mere animation - it has more heart and soul in its tiniest pixel than most live-action movies can boast in their entirety. No matter how you look at it, through the innocent eyes of a child or the wider, wiser world-view of an adult, the bright, buoyant 'Up' brims with imagination, adventure, humor and heart. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but you won't fail to be lifted!",9,1,2,29 April 2015
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino Lets His 'Dogs' Out in Testosterone-land!
","Tarantino has an almost impenitent appetite for blood-spattered barbarism, we all know that. But in his gritty, brutal crime-caper Reservoir Dogs â€“ a tantalizing debut feature that put the name Quentin Tarantino into the cinematic spotlight - his testosterone level is off every chart, as he happily wallows in his own adolescent love of criminals, violence, and vulgarity. So much so that, the movie appears to be set in a theme park called 'Testosterone-land', where nature isn't only red in tooth and claw, it's black as the heart of man and dank as any rag and bone shop of the human spirit.Tarantino gets things off to a spectacularly engrossing start, as Reservoir Dogs begins with the iconic sequence involving the coffee- shop banter of six morally ambiguous outlaws. Yes, they are meant to be an urban wild-bunch, but damn, if they aren't charming and charismatic! Decked out in matching black suits and thin black ties, they've been brought together by a mob kingpin specifically to pull off a heist, and they've been kept deliberately ignorant of one another's identities, knowing each other only by their color coded pseudonyms. The heist is to be a one-shot deal - one job and they scatter to the winds. Soon after masterful opening gabfest, when you start settling in with the idea that Tarantino has made a heist movie, he pulls a coup by skipping right over the robbery itself. Instead, it cuts straight to the aftermath, as we find our wolf-pack hole up in a warehouse after the heist goes belly up, each trying to figure out which one of them squawked to the police. Dissension and suspicion run high and soon, it becomes clear to the audience that at least one of these guys is a snitch, but which one?Tarantino's glitziest stroke in his heist drama is never to show the main event: the film's 'action' occurs after the heist. Tarantino expertly builds tension, interweaving scenes of the aftermath of the thieves' foiled heist with scenes depicting them getting ready for the heist, backtracking in time and point of view half a dozen times. Each flashback reveals just enough information to fill in a piece of the puzzle. His palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect. His trademarks of amplified violence and vulgar dialogue are in full force, as are the flurry of obscure to not-so-obscure pop culture references woven into the dialogue. Part of the appeal of Reservoir Dogs is the way it makes all of it feel terribly authentic, a veracity that is a tribute to the skill of its actors, particularly Michael Madsen who is awesome as the sadistic yet painfully cool Mr. Blonde and Steve Buscemi who is deadpan funny as the always-on-the- edge Mr. Pink.Reservoir Dogs grabs you by the throat and digs its claws in deep. It may seem hideously ugly on paper, but in the sure way it's made, it's inconveniently dazzling - driven, beautifully made and completely wacko at once. It's pure outlaw art!",9,2,5,23 April 2015
Some Like It Hot," This One's Still Red Hot!
","Some Like It Hot is a wacky, clever, ludicrous comedy that starts off like a firecracker and keeps on throwing off lively sparks till the very end.The plot is a classic screwball. The setup: It's Chicago, 1929; the era of jazz, prohibition, bootlegging and gangland rub- outs. Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are two hack jazz musicians who inadvertently witness a mob killing on St. Valentine's Day. In a desperate bid to flee the scene, the boys jump onto a train to Florida disguised as Josephine and Daphne ('I never liked the sound of 'Geraldine''), the newest members of an all-girl jazz band where they fall for attractive, bubble-headed ukulele- player Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). Once in Florida, Joe poses as the tycoon Junior, sleazily designed to fulfill Sugar's every fantasy of a man while Daphne, carried along on the tides of farcical necessity, is propositioned by an addle-brained millionaire Osgood (Joe E. Brown). Seductions and obvious complications ensue. Identities become fluid and changeable. Just when things start looking up, the goons arrive for a mobster's convention at the same hotel where the girls and the two erstwhile guys are playing. And soon a volley of bullets and witty lines fly by!Fifty-five years on, Billy Wilder's charade has lost none of its luster, largely because of the absolutely riotous turns by the three principal cast members. Monroe's performance as the fuzzy blonde Sugar has a deliciously naive quality. She's a comedienne with that combination of sex appeal and timing that is unrivaled even today. Both Curtis and Lemmon are absolutely impeccable as they bicker, cross-dress, and chase their way into audience's hearts. Their interactions are never less than the stuff of comic gold (watch Lemmon mouth 'If those gangsters come in here and kill us, and we're taken to the morgue dressed like this I'll die of embarrassment.') while they play off of one another in such a way that they simultaneously propel the plot's shenanigans and develop their characters. The movie's lasting impact, however, is owed in great deal to the direction and the Wilder touch is indelible: a work of shocking confidence. He treats the outlandish plot so deftly that the ridiculous somehow appears possible and the shocking turns into laughter. He keeps the momentum of this madcap comedy such that it keeps rolling along, a mirthful romp that knows just when to draw back before crossing the line to the vulgar.There's an illusion of effortlessness about Some Like It Hot that contributes to its endurance: though the characters are sweating through the madcap circus, Wilder and the top-notch cast keep the proceedings effervescent and breezily paced, giving us a movie with remarkable audacity that transcends all ages for the sake of a universal good time. A peerless classic!",9,1,1,29 March 2015
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino Pounds Mirth And Mayhem into An Outrageously Funny Postmodern Pulp!
","Quentin Tarantino's mesmeric Pulp Fiction is a slow dance on the killing ground, a prodigious horror-comedy spun out with such ferocious comic glee and buoyancy that belie its seeming cruelty. Superficially set in the gang haunts, streets, bistros, apartments, pawnshops and eateries in the cheesiest corners of modern Los Angeles, this dizzily convoluted noir plunges us into a kind of retro-nightmare fantasy land (formed of Tarantino's own pop-drenched experience) that keeps looping back on itself and traps us in a cul- de-sac of double-crosses, absurdity, arousal and danger, never completely sure of where anyone's going or why â€“ creating a sheer directionless excitement that only Tarantino can conjure. The structure itself is wickedly ingenious: Three interconnected stories, bracketed by several preludes and a few codas, are told deliberately out of sequence, with the same cast - a bloody band of outsiders - popping up everywhere. Most of the characters are familiar - the boxer who refuses to throw a fight (Bruce Willis), an obsessive war veteran (Christopher Walken), a mob boss's jaded wife (Uma Thurman), two desperate young lovers starting a crime spree (Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer), a pair of single-minded hit men who operate within a twisted code of honor (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson) - but Tarantino's approach to their behavior consistently avoids the stereotypical. By and large these mugs exist in a moral vacuum which, for Tarantino, is the ideal atmosphere for cracking jokes while cracking open heads. Their tales all start slowly, but soon everyone's destiny plays out as the stories dovetail into outlandish twists. Stuff happens in Pulp Fiction, exhilarating, jaw-dropping, visceral stuff but Tarantino weaves the stock stories into an amazingly coherent whole. Unlike other action-thrillers, this movie gets its charge not from action pyrotechnics but from its electric barrage of language, wisecracks and dialog, as the lingo takes on a murderous eloquence - a verbal swagger. The tension Tarantino creates between the threat of guns and the greater threat of verbal fusillade is electrifying. It's hard to imagine any viewer leaving this extravagantly demented low- life lollapalooza without carrying away at least a few indelible moments. The entire cast, like Tarantino, also seems to revel in sloshing around in this muck, each one of them having a time of their lives.Pulp Fiction also makes it clear, despite its gory content, that Tarantino isn't just some punk nihilist on a sick joyride; his movies are all about consequences. There is a moral core in Pulp Fiction too- a subversive one. But ultimately this is also what makes the movie so unexpectedly buoyant. Despite the drugs, the blood, the language and the grit, Pulp Fiction is fundamentally light-hearted. It's fluff!",9,0,1,20 April 2015
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," An Unflinching Barrel of Laughs!
","In their attempts to get out of a jam, the four East End lads seem to be digging themselves deeper into a hole. They decide to pony up a wad of cash and send in their best card player, to a high stakes game in order to bring home some gold. However, their host Hatchet Harry has rigged the game to rook the lads for all they're worth and by the end of the evening, they're half a million in debt. In order to repay Harry, the four hatch a new plan to intercept a shipment of drugs. What follows next is a hilarious series of accidental double- crosses, botched heists and other bungled crimes. And the violence, while always nerve-wracking, is more implied than graphically depicted. Part of the fun of the film is trying to figure out who, if anyone, will be left standing.The plot is very clever and has a delirious pace that threatens to draw you from your seat at every turn as the fortunes of the protagonists change in flashes, from sky-high to rock bottom. Thus begins a violent, dangerous and funny ride to the unexpected conclusion of the film. Ritchie's camera work is sprightly, and he has a definite rhythm for slang and profanity in his dialogue. His artistic use of freeze- frames, slow motion and other camera trickery proves he is a precocious talent to be reckoned with. He orchestrates the plots and anti-plots with the delight of a sadistic child. Even when the accents are as indecipherable as the plot, Ritchie keeps the action percolating and the humor on high. This movie is loaded with a troupe of unforgettable larrikins, played with boisterous enthusiasm by a solid, ensemble cast particularly the four who make up the lead quartet of Moran, Flemyng, Fletcher and Statham - they are hilariously dazzling, playing complete screw-ups with believable camaraderie and a kind of goofy charm. They're losers sure, but you will find yourselves rooting for them through every twist and turn. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels works beautifully as an exercise in joyful anarchy, an unsentimental roller-coaster ride that is both violent and funny. It has a certain exuberance about it, and in a time when movies follow formulas like zombies, it's alive!",10,1,1,20 March 2015
Titanic," Titanic is A Fantastic Voyage!
","The story of 'Titanic' is so good that if written as mere fiction, it would be dismissed as preposterous.In April of 1912, Titanic set out on its maiden voyage to the City of New York. 'The Ship of Dreams' as it was called, was a floating palace for the wealthy elite, reportedly 'unsinkable' by incorporating the latest in shipbuilding technology. After winning a pair of third-class tickets for himself and a friend in a poker game, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) looks forward to returning to his native America but finds himself drawn to a first-class passenger named Rose (Kate Winslet). She is the 16-year-old fiancée of Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) - a high-society gentleman that doesn't like to lose - returning from her wedding in Europe; a match of convenience pushed by her mother to bolster the family's faded coffers. After Jack's chance meeting on the ship's fantail with Rose threatening to hurl herself into the ocean, an unlikely romance begins. No sooner do they profess their love to each other, than an iceberg in the North Atlantic tests the character of everyone on board, from the ship's captain to the poorest of the poor as it slowly iceberg rips the safe, stable deck out from beneath the characters.Titanic is an extraordinary motion picture – a jaw-dropping feat of outstanding art direction, costume design and cinematography. The film captures the essence and decadence of the era, as well as the spirit and raw allure of the ship herself. Coupled with nearly seamless visual effects, James Cameron's Titanic feels like a wholly real creation. Instead of treating the Titanic as a microcosm of society, Cameron makes the ship a vividly realized, fluid symbol of human destiny, mapping the different levels of the ship as levels of character, from the social graces of the salon to the sexual heat of the engine room. Created through a complex blend of partial sets, models and digital effects, Cameron's Titanic is breathtaking in its wholeness, heartbreaking in its destruction. The film's final hour portrays the sinking, not merely as spectacle, but as a series of harsh moral choices that must be made by all the characters as they decide who will live and who will die. But perhaps, the neatest thing about his filmmaking is the engaging way 'Titanic' sucks us into what seems, on the surface, to be a magnetic romance, while underneath, there are dangerous currents of class consciousness and shoals of hubris. Yes, he does paint his story in broad strokes, and some of the dialogue is risible, but Leo and Kate sell the hell out of it, with their undeniable chemistry.Titanic isn't just a great film, it's a magnificent historical record of one of the most unfortunate disasters in the annals of human history, that is both poignant and personal.",9,1,1,14 January 2016
Mystic River," Eastwood's Mystic River is Overflowing with Talent!
","In his somber psychological study 'Mystic River', Clint Eastwood delivers a true rarity - a work of high seriousness with a laid- back, un-emphatic touch. Years after one of them was abducted and abused - although we are not shown anything, the clear implication in these early moments is that a great and irrevocable horror is about to break out - three former friends find their lives entwined again uneasily by another crime, 25 years later. The crime here is the brutal, inexplicable murder of Jimmy's (Sean Penn) 19 year-old daughter. Arriving at the crime scene and realizing the full horror of what has occurred, he unleashes a pure animal howl. The only way he knows how to survive his sorrow is to seek revenge, and demands rough justice. The vicious homicide sends the community into turmoil, reuniting the three friends in a strange series of events – Sean (Kevin Bacon) is assigned to the case as the chief investigating officer, while Dave (Tim Robbins) emerges as a likely suspect. As the trio's unavoidable attachment deepens, the true repercussions of the childhood trauma begin to crystallize and haunt – Dave's psychological makeup eerily mirrors Jimmy's deepening mental disintegration, and Sean's forced to balance his past bonds with his current investigation.The sheer classical elegance of Eastwood's direction is a delight. He constantly finds new ways to keep the storyline moving without seeming too kitschy for a drama. The movie takes its time; the camera settles in and meditates on the characters, giving them space to reveal or conceal and in turn offers realism as a kind of grim poetry, even while managing to hook the most casual viewer right from the first frame.But it is the subtle portrayal of the three leading men which holds Mystic River together by adding psychological weight to the revenge- driven murder mystery. Penn delivers another multi-layered performance as a man in who rage, grief and honor suffer a head-on collision. Penn is so compellingly explosive that he outdoes even the best of his earlier work as a man who has uneasily made his peace with domesticity but still has a con's instincts. Robbins blends emotional exhaustion and uncertainty of direction to form a potpourri of despair that's really heartbreaking. He underplays beautifully, giving us a morose palooka who sounds dense one minute and then weaves muddled webs of metaphor, struggling to articulate his feelings. Bacon is as reliable as ever, playing the intelligent officer who holds emotions at an arm's length. It would be criminal to overlook the key female performances, particularly Marcia Gay Harden's heartbreaking turn as a woman caught between love and disgust.Methodical, riveting and emotionally charged; it's a story of lost innocence and a reminder that the past cannot easily be suppressed or forgotten. A tale of tragic misinterpretation, Mystic River ends with a certain amount of closure but still leaves behind an emptiness. A haunting and provocative psychological mystery!",9,0,0,2 April 2015
It's a Wonderful Life," Years Later, It's A Wonderful Life Continues to be a Reassuring Holiday Spectacle!
","What Christmas needs is schmaltz and snow and Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life has both by the hamper full. Set in Bedford Falls, New York, the movie follows common man George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), who after getting married to his childhood sweetheart Mary (Donna Reed) takes over the management of the building and loan association in his hometown that acts as a charity organization. He tries hard to buck a local Scrooge – evil rival banker Old Man Potter (Lionel Barrymore), who never misses a chance to jockey him into a position where he could be dealt misery. However, all his troubles come to a head as his mortgage company is plunged into financial crisis, after being broken on the wheel of capitalism. Prodded by failure, incompetence and deceit, our hero is soon brought to despair by fate and the machinations of Mr Potter and teeters on the edge of sanity one snowy Christmas Eve. It is then that George, in a moment of weakness, wishes he was never born. A genial, bumbling 292-year-old wingless angel from heaven, named Clarence (Henry Travers), who is assigned to watch out for him, grants that wish. In the fantastic events that follow, George is brought to a realization of how much his apparently aimless existence has meant to others and shows him the futility of feeling futile.What is remarkable about 'It's a Wonderful Life' is how well it holds up over the years. It has a simple message told elegantly, intelligently and with a whole lot of heart that never gets old. A socially responsible movie is entitled to the luxury of a heartfelt happy ending, especially if it has been earned! And this film so earns it! Capra's trick rests in the fulsome manner in which he allows a motion picture audience to share in the glory, investing the story with the tremendous heart that always stamps his offerings. This couldn't be other than a Capra picture, the humanness of its story the prevailing factor at every turn of situation. And essential to its extraordinary enduring power is the towering presence of James Stewart who with the supporting cast puts up an amazingly controlled performance, to give a simple but poignant script an unbending strength of character. All these carefully devised components make it an absolutely enduring classic which does not wear down even as decades go by. The movie that defined the term 'Capra-esque' - and cemented Stewart's position as Hollywood's favorite everyman - is the ultimate winter warmer.",9,1,3,20 April 2015
Die Hard," A Seminal Action Film for 'Die-Hard' Genre Fans!
","Die Hard is an action picture with a capital 'A'. In fact, you might as well go ahead and capitalize the whole darn word. It's an expertly constructed machine for mayhem - a relentlessly thrilling, masterfully executed action film that turns up all the knobs and sets the standard for all of the American films made in the genre.To begin with, it's the classic plot hook of one man against many, right against wrong - a sweaty, bare-chested, all-American hero who battles a band of swarthy, heavily accented terrorist villains. But Die Hard is more layered than your average action movie. It is Christmas Eve. John McClane (Bruce Willis), a New York cop, is in town to spend the holidays with his kids and to fashion a reconciliation with his estranged wife Holly, who works for the Los Angeles branch of Nakatomi Corporation. Planning a rather different holiday agenda are the terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). The dastardly dozen invade the plush 30th floor offices of Nakatomi during its Christmas party, and hold the employees hostage as a computer whiz cracks a code that will put our bad guys in possession of $600 million in negotiable bonds. McClane's in the john when the bad guys arrive, and he manages to slip away into the bowels of the building with nothing but his handgun, where he becomes the fly in the ointment of the criminals' plans. As the FBI helplessly marshals its forces outside, it's up to McClane to carry on the battle from within. McClane must scrap his way through the mêlée, free the hostages, and in the process repair his troubled marriage. Shirtless and barefoot, McClane swings through elevator shafts, clambers up heating ducts and creeps across rooftops as he tries to pick off the bad guys one by one. There's something satisfyingly claustrophobic about the premise, and the movie makers fully realize it's potential. Director John McTiernan works here with a clever script that offers ample opportunity for violence that is mind-boggling without being mindless. He composes the action cleanly and logically allowing the proceedings to acquire a sense of scale that can't help but impress. The film always looks gorgeous, and it never stops being exhilarating.At the center of this whirlwind of a movie is Bruce Willis, who blends the vulnerability - normally unseen in action film heroes - deftly with the requisite superhuman feats. He almost burns the screen with his overwhelming charisma, his wicked sense of humor and his big-balled bravado. He ensures McClane remains human and relatable, even as the bodies pile up around him. The rogues in the movie pitch in equally commendable performances, particularly Alan Rickman. Smarmy yet charismatic, Rickman adds a theatrical flourish to his performance which only makes him more menacing. Sleekly engineered, impeccably staged and shrewdly dosed with humor and sentiment, Die Hard manages to be heart-pounding and teeth- gritting every single time. Yippy-Ki-Yay!",9,3,3,22 April 2015
Rosemary's Baby," In an Era of 'Go-Boo' Horror, Polanski's Baby Endures as An Unnerving Tale!
","Rosemary's Baby is an ingeniously deliberated dramatic thriller that delivers the slow-burn, taut story of a young couple that has just moved into the upper class sector of New York. Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and husband Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavetes) land a spacious apartment in a building with an extensive history of ghoulish occurrences. No sooner have they been acquainted with their eccentric neighbors Roman (Sidney Blackmer) and Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) than Rosemary gets pregnant and the couple sees an up-tick in their fortunes, both professionally and personally. Very soon, every old crone in the building starts intruding Rosemary's life, from steering her toward their chosen obstetrician to forcing down her throat a vitamin drink of their own concoction. Just a few bites of their chocolate mousse give her woozy nightmares and start a hellish tempest in her womb. She has strange dreams of participating in arcane rituals. Soon a horrifying sexual fever dream renders her incapacitated by fear and paranoia. She begins to suspect that her neighbors have nefarious goals and are planning to harm her baby and gets curious why her husband is allowing them to do so.The apartment takes on an entire life of its own that hides its own pulse and underbelly but is completely free of exposure from the outside world. All the while once Rosemary catches on to her neighbors' ploy and decides to flee for her life, there's the sense of claustrophobia as she discovers everything she assumed she knew in her life has been a facade right from the word go. Rosemary's Baby is inundated with Polanski's trademark style and preoccupations. It draws viewers gradually into considering the possibility that the movie's series of strange coincidences and accumulating sense of dread are only subjective representations of Rosemary's unraveling mental state. And Polanski's ability to prime the audience into questioning Rosemary's suspicions gives it an unnerving quality. Polanski (who also wrote the screenplay) is more interested in creating a crawling sense of discomfort by making everything seem plausible. He expertly winds up the paranoia with spooky atmospherics and morbid humor.Cassavetes is deliciously smarmy as struggling actor Guy who will do whatever it takes to become a famous. Gordon plays the garrulous, nosy menace Minnie in her inimitable style. But the real star here is 23-year-old Mia Farrow playing the mousy title character, who uses her timorous space-child vulnerability remarkably to underscore her terror and solitude. Even after all these years, the movie is still a terrifying thriller that is held up by its incredible ensemble cast, and clever premise. In this era of go-boo and CGI suffused horror movies, Rosemary's Baby continues to be celebrated as a cautionary tale.",9,0,2,24 March 2015
Zero Dark Thirty," Kathryn Bigelow Adapts Modern History's Greatest Manhunt Into A Crackerjack Thriller!
","Never before has the war-on-terror been shot with such a cold dose of reality. As entertainment, Kathryn Bigelow's engrossing and symbolically astute Zero Dark Thirty is a great accomplishment - a somber, black-winged benediction for what we might count as a lost decade. It depicts the long-lasting struggle of terrorism with immense veracity - the greatest manhunt in modern history playing catalyst to a gripping tale of obsession both dark and dangerous. With Zero Dark Thirty, director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal present a different kind of espionage environment - one that follows a fictionalized CIA operative Maya (Jessica Chastain) recruited specifically to ferret out the architect of the 9/11 attacks – Osama Bin Laden. It's one filled with paper work, meetings, and sifting through a never ending stream of intelligence. But it's also one where the stakes are always high, danger is found at every turn, where a hunch can lead to a breakthrough and misinformation can lead to wasted years of chasing ghosts. Through Maya we share the successes and frustrations of tracking down the head of a snake so twisted and slippery it's of no wonder that it took over a decade to get a strangle hold on him. Yet Maya represents more than the CIA, she is America herself: wounded, driven and in conflict on how to move on after killing the bogeyman that haunted their nightmares for too long.Kathryn Bigelow takes the procedural model and brushes away every unnecessary detail - rarely glorifying and never dumbing down or 'Hollywoodizing' important tidbits of the plot to get a rise out of the audience – leaving behind a potent film that never feels bogged down by its own complexity. Even though the outcome is common public knowledge, we are enthralled by the way the story is spooled out. Even at a runtime of three hours, Bigelow displays an uncanny sense of pacing and rhythm, tightly cutting back and forth between Maya's exhausting hunt for bin Laden and her constant inner-struggle to never give up, even when faced with a complete dead end that promises her nothing. All this leads up to the film's most audacious set-piece, an almost unbearably tense, moment by-moment re-creation of the raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. But Bigelow is careful not to exploit the cathartic potential of the raid, and the movie ends on a note that's wonderfully dissonant with the expectations of an action movie crowd.Maya is a tough cookie, but by casting the pale, red-haired, rather waifish Jessica Chastain, the director makes the unstressed point that strong women sometimes come in deceptively frail packages. She plays Maya with stone-cold intensity, fuelled by anger directed towards a target so elusive that he is more a phantom than a terrorist leader. Zero Dark Thirty rests on Chastain's shoulders, but she's always interacting with strong talent and that only helps to keep the film level and never without a pulse.Zero Dark Thirty remains an immaculately put together work of art that deserves all the attention it was given.",9,1,4,6 May 2015
To Kill a Mockingbird," An Effortlessly Poignant Social Commentary!
","To Kill A Mockingbird is a hauntingly nostalgic portrayal of childhood mischief set in a racially divided Alabama town in the 1930s. If the film's tone seems overly righteous, it's offset by a poetic lyricism that is difficult to resist embracing.At the outset, it plops us down serenely in the comfort of a grubby Southern town at the time of the Great Depression, before 'desegregation' was even a word. Gregory Peck plays incorruptible lawyer Atticus Finch, a widower with two loving, if rambunctious children - 10-year-old Jem (Phillip Alford) and a thoroughly beguiling 6-year-old tomboy Scout (Mary Badham). We are immediately squeezed inside the skin of Scout and Jem as they go racing and tumbling around the neighborhood, shrieking with childish defiance at crusty old Mrs. Dubose, skirting with awe around the creaky wooden house where the mysterious Boo Radley (Robert Duvall) lives, who according to neighborhood legend, is crazy and chained to his bed by his father. While the kids play, Atticus has been chosen to defend a young black man accused of rape. As the trial looms and the townsfolk attempt to enact street justice against the accused, Atticus' pursuit of justice remains unwavering. As the trial ensues, Atticus, Jem, and especially Scout learn as much about each other as they do about their own fears and prejudices.Its success is in part due to its source material - Harper Lee's best-selling novel tells a fierce story. However, Lee's child's-eye view of southern bigotry gains something in its translation to the screen by Robert Mulligan, who knows exactly how to capture a child's subjective experience. Mulligan achieves a bewitching indication of the excitement and thrill of being a child. There is so much feeling for children in the film, so much delightful observation of their spirit, energy and charm as depicted by two superb discoveries, Badham and Alford. Mulligan even wrings a remarkable performance from Gregory Peck. As Atticus, his performance is the bedrock of this classic film, one of those rare instances when a character perfectly captures the essence of its source material without compromising it in any way. It's a simple, controlled performance of passion and restraint which turns out to be curiously effective.To Kill A Mockingbird is effortlessly engaging as a social commentary, while the sobering subtext gives the film a heart and soul that most filmmakers would kill to replicate. This is storytelling at its very best!",9,0,1,30 March 2015
The Bridge on the River Kwai," One Word Sums Up David Lean's Masterful Epic - 'Madness'!
","David Lean's epic The Bridge on the River Kwai is a formidable arsenal, a slickly calculated piece of entertainment, an angry razz at the thing called war, a despairing salute to the men war makes and above all, an ironic masterpiece.Despite being held in a Japanese POW camp in Burma, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) still runs his regiment by the military textbook. However, Nicholson meets his match in the domineering prison commander Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), and the two find themselves on a collision course when Saito gets orders to build a railroad bridge vital to Japan's war effort, over the murky river Kwai. Initially, the English balk. But later, to Saito's utter confusion, Nicholson decides to uphold British military traditions with his men and uses the construction of the bridge to prove the mettle of the British soldiers, seeing it as an exercise in keeping up their morale. While the British see such a stance as nothing short of collaboration, the stiff upper lipped officer sees it as a matter of pride. Meanwhile, American Navy man Shears (William Holden) miraculously escapes from Saito's camp, only to be conscripted to return and destroy the bridge the inmates are building. While clearly a suicide mission, he agrees, hoping that Nicholson and his men won't somehow stall the raid. The daring mission is discovered, moments before fulfillment, by Nicholson, now unbalanced by the 'glory' of his bridge-building feat, which in turn leads to an excruciatingly tense climax.The Bridge on the River Kwai carries us through a particularly rough reality - that sometimes, the line between cooperation and collusion is razor thin. The best parts of the movie concentrate on this dilemma, delivered by David Lean in a way that makes even the most mundane concept seem superlative. He displays an artistic and aesthetic acumen that marries material to meaning in a way that is almost impossible to copy. He also guides his performers through a series of fine portrayals. Holden is easy and credible in a role that is the pivot point of the story while Hayakawa is solidly impressive as the despotic Colonel Saito, limning him as an admixture of cruelty and correctness born out of a lifetime of training. But the film unquestionably belongs to Guinness. He etches an unforgettable portrait of the typical British army officer, strict, didactic and serene in his adherence to the book. It's a performance of tremendous power and dignity.What eventually elevates it to the rank of an artistic triumph is the engrossing entertainment it purveys. Suffice it to say, it's a masterpiece. And an epic one at that!",9,0,1,30 April 2015
Downfall," A Relentlessly Honest Movie Recounting Hitler's 'Downfall'!
","Downfall, Oliver Hirschbiegel's thoroughly devastating digest of the Third Reich's final days, isn't about commuting the sentence that history gave the Nazis, but heeding its warning - a gruesome, sustained-tension lesson about informed politics.The movie is based on the final ten days of the Third Reich, as told from the perspective of several key figures that were present in the bowels of a dank bunker beneath a burning Berlin that Adolf Hitler retreated to, as Germany was invaded by the Russian forces in 1945. Hitler, now hunched-over parody of himself, seems defeated from the moment we see him, but his megalomania and outright insanity is always lurking just beneath the surface. On some level, we sense — as do some of the characters in the film — that Hitler knows it's all over for him and his Reich, but that doesn't prevent him from ranting about delusional betrayals, moving nonexistent armies across maps and blatantly refusing to surrender even in the face of certain downfall. But Hitler's mindset is not the entire crux of this complex film, which is really just as concerned, and possibly more so, with his inner circle's reaction to impending doom. Once thriving individuals in the streets of a city that showered them in rude luxuries, they have now been reduced to mere rats in an underground maze. As the dream around them crumbles into heaps of rubble and their followers become corpses in crowded alleys, we watch the hope and strength fade from their faces. Like the characters of the best of Shakespeare's tragedies, they occupy the narrative like shattered mirrors of themselves, retreating to the safety of their self-delusions and often reflecting on the reasons for their imminent destiny, as if to quietly confess their evil and seek some semblance of respect before the end comes. Downfall takes on the unenviable task of portraying Hitler as a human being, rather than a caricature or larger-than-life monster as the norm has dictated. But while doing so, Hirschbiegel simply strips away the myth from the monster, laying bare the utter banality of his evil. It features a staggeringly creepy performance by Bruno Ganz, whose Hitler is both a raving psychotic and a beaten, melancholic man. He generates indelible ferocity as Hitler - his composure snapping at will and foam frothing during his delusional flights of fancy about military might. He takes hold of the job with clenched fists; his manner of expression and the growl in his voice are so meticulous and researched, there is seldom a moment we consciously think about it as a performance; it is an uncompromised embodiment.Downfall is a spine-chilling experience, a masterpiece of filmmaking which conclusively damns the repetition of its history. It is an unflinching, hard, relentlessly honest movie that refuses to ask questions that have easy answers. But even with all the tough questions the movie poses, it remains a long stare into an abyss from which no comforting answers can emerge.",9,1,2,21 April 2015
Whiplash," 'Whiplash' is A Whip-Smart Entertainer that Doesn't Miss A Beat!
","In Whiplash, JK Simmons plays Terence Fletcher - the tyrannical conductor of a prestigious music conservatory who believes in pushing them to breaking point and beyond in his own insatiable quest to unearth the new Charlie Parker. But while imposing impossible standards on everyone, it is talented drummer Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) who finds himself singled out for the maestro's ferocious attention. So when Fletcher tells the promising percussionist to 'have fun', you know he means the opposite. Unless your idea of fun is being bullied, humiliated, and played off against your hapless band-mates. But Andrew is determined to shed all the blood, sweat and tears it takes to become the band's lynch-pin. What follows is a sadomasochistic battle of wills between teacher and pupil, as Fletcher terrorizes, torments and humiliates the young recruit, pushing him ever harder to see whether he snaps to the rhythm, or breaks in two. The ensuing film is a tour-de-force that defies easy stereotyping. Shot in 19 days on a shoe-string budget, Whiplash moves at a whip-crack pace that takes its rhythmic cues from drumming. Written and directed by Damien Chazelle and partly inspired by his own experiences as a jazz drummer in high school, the film offers dark, rip-snorting fun that inspires a whirlwind of emotions before leaving you on an exhilarated high. His script is adept at dropping explosive one-liners but it is also fiercely intelligent in the way that it poses questions while also serving up characters who are worth hanging out with. His direction, meanwhile, is pretty much pace- perfect in the way that it hits all the right beats yet is savvy enough and confident enough to toss in some curve-balls. The kinetic editing cuts with finger-snapping dexterity making the film pop with a rim-shot twang and adding a visual flourish.At its racing heart beats a performance of splenetic majesty from JK Simmons as the fearsome Fletcher, a despot in F-major who conducts the music school like it's the Marine Corps, only with harsher language. He is a sinewy symphony of physicality, his poised fingers waving the drama onward apace, his endlessly expressive eyes alert and ablaze, and his razor-sharp mouth playing the paper-cut dialogue like a demonic fiddle. Teller is terrific too as the young gun bleeding for his art, wholly convincing as the raw talent in whom even the most poisonous taskmaster can hear the distant drums of greatness.Damien Chazelles' greatest achievement lies in the fact that even when the drama descends into parodist para-diddles and melodramatic car-crashes, there's a splashy, impressionist energy which keeps us locked into its insistent rhythm. Come the last beat, you'll probably be exhausted. But you'll also feel entertained, inspired and wonderfully alive. For all its overripe contrivance, you'll leave the cinema with a spring in your step and a thump in your chest. The ovation starts here.",9,2,4,1 February 2016
The Green Mile," Frank Darabont Improves Upon his Literary Source By A Mile!
","The Green Mile, based on Stephen King's 1996 novel, is a stirring drama of metaphysical fantasy wedded to grim reality. The central protagonist Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks), a prison guard for the Louisiana State Penitentiary for criminals on the death row, keeps things running smoothly on the Green Mile, so-named due to the scuffed green linoleum that covers the floor between the cells and the electric chair. He receives his convicted tenants with rare dignity and takes no pleasure in strapping them in to ride the lightning, seeing it instead as a sad, necessary business. Of course there's that urinary infection that makes him feel like he's 'pissing razorblades' but Edgecomb tries to stay calm and compassionate. The ground under his feet begins to shift when John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), condemned to die by electrocution, arrives. A child-like giant, Coffey has been convicted of murdering two pre-pubescent girls in an apparently air-tight case; he was found with their bodies in his massive arms, covered in their blood. Despite his towering stature, he is a gentle man who seems to have a mysterious power much more important than physical might. Edgecomb senses the same, but only takes his own doubts to heart after Coffey displays a miraculous healing touch that cures him of his urinary infection. Soon, it is readily apparent that Coffey is no criminal. In fact, he is a miracle worker, an angel-on-earth with the power to heal and give life. This leaves Paul and the movie with a moral dilemma and throws out every preconceived notion of justice, faith, and redemption behind the barred windows.Lovingly crafted, intense and pure of spirit, Frank Darabont delivers The Green Mile as a Biblical allegory that explores the range of human kindness and cruelty as he meticulously sculpts his large cast of characters against magnificent scenery, infusing a lustrous depth to the film. Despite its varying tone, the fact that the movie still comes together as a cohesive whole is testament to Darabont's talent and dedication to spinning a cinematic story that matches the literary source.He also extracts wonderfully modulated performances from his entire cast. Tom Hanks embodies Edgecomb with a reliable decency without overselling it. The rest of the supporting cast also pitches in remarkable performances, especially Sam Rockwell as the psychotic Wild Bill, who is literally foaming at the mouth with evil and Doug Hutchison who gives a hauntingly vicious portrayal of the sadistic Percy Wetmore. But perhaps impressive of them all is Mr. Duncan as the imposing black man who despite being a dead man walking, is a Christ-like vehicle of God, capable of miracles. He puts up a deeply moving performance, showing us both Coffey's innocence and his dignity as he labors mightily to save his character from turning into a shallow stereotype, instead proving to be an unforgettable presence.The Green Mile is indeed a rousing cinematic experience with a deeply human core. It's what I call movie-magic!",9,1,2,29 April 2015
Jaws," Spielberg's Nautical Masterpiece will have You Biting Your Nails!
","Long cited as the movie that changed Hollywood into a sensation- bound blockbuster factory, Jaws continues to be regarded as a high- point of Steven Spielberg's oeuvre - a near Hitchcockian exercise in transference of guilt and making the audience pay for its illicit pleasures. The setting is almost quaint by today's blockbuster standards. Instead of a faraway fantasy realm or a city sheltered by superheroes, Jaws takes place in the beach-side town of Amity during a blazing hot summer where tourists are out in force. However, the film's opening moments foreshadow the trauma that's to come as a young woman's sandy frolic ends with her gurgled scream as she disappears into an ocean, having fallen prey to the great white. While more bodies turn up on Amity Island, Spielberg milks the slow burn, hiding the shark in his watery depths, instead introducing us to Roy Scheider's protagonist, Police Chief Martin Brody. Despite Brody's protestations, the incidents go largely unreported as the town mayor doesn't want panic to keep the all-important vacationers away. But when an attack is witnessed in broad daylight, mass hysteria takes over and there's no denying the calamity the town faces. Soon, it's left to Brody, ballsy shark- hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) and oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to head out into the ocean on a heroic expedition and finish off the aquatic beast.Jaws begins as a sunshine-bright horror movie: ordinary people motivated by greed and pleasure are shaken upon understanding that a murderous uncanny fiend has arrived in their midst. Then it becomes an astounding descendant of nautical tales: rage and obsession unleash a flurry of vehemence. Spielberg expertly conceals the monster (don't listen to the cynics who claim the shark looks iffy now), luring us into a false sense of security before unleashing him into the frame sparingly to create impact jolts. Four decades later it continues to instill fear because Spielberg's direction is so assuredly taut, and is ably bolstered by John Williams' now-iconic, terror-inducing 'da- dumb' score (the alternating two-note motif still signals a shift to the edge of your seat, creating a throbbing sense of menace). Spielberg wants us to be terrified by his film, but he also wants us to be awed and excited and he achieves that with aplomb. Credit is also due for the cast for investing the monster movie premise with such believability. The trio's cracking camaraderie has seldom been bettered and the aquatic terror is deftly balanced with lively, likable characterizations. Jaws is a marvel of economic storytelling; its formula so hard to capture it's now near-mythical – filmmakers have been chasing it like Ahab chasing Moby Dick ever since. They don't make them like this anymore!",9,2,4,14 April 2015
Inception," Nolan Turns his Pipe Dream into A Reality!
","Combining the audacity of his earlier efforts with the multi-million-dollar spectacle of his Batman blockbusters, Christopher Nolan's Inception is a movie that puts its mindless rivals to shame with its dizzying acumen and stunning visuals.The movie takes place in the near future, where Leonardo DiCaprio's Dom Cobb steals secrets by infiltrating his victims' dreams. Saito (Ken Wantanabe) hires Cobb to pull off an infinitely more difficult mission of 'Inception', the planting of an idea into someone's (Cillian Murphy playing Robert Fischer) head in such a way that it seems to have been created naturally. If that's challenging enough, it gets even trickier. To accomplish the task, Cobb collects a team of experts: Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his partner-in-crime, Ariadne (Ellen Page), the architect who creates the dream-world, and Eames (Tom Hardy) and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), who handle other parts of the process. The team has to penetrate a labyrinth of dreams within dreams, encountering ever more extreme hazards on every level. To say anymore would be criminal but what was mentioned above is just one layer of this absolutely enthralling plot.As the director, Christopher Nolan manages to produce a brilliant tour-de-force. Nolan does just what the characters of Inception had set out to do - sowing the seed of a premise and concept that holds so much promise and then delivering that promise with such panache, so much so that you'll want to continue living in that world created by the cognitive senses by interpreting what's on screen, then fantasizing on it a lot more with the subconscious. Nolan juggles all of these intricate layers very prudently to make them connect. Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb - the emotional core of the film – shows you exactly why he is lauded one of the best actors working in the industry today. The supporting roles are a tad bit less fleshed out but all the actors that make up this fine ensemble deliver terrific performances.Inception is a lavishly deceitful thriller, dripping with layers upon layers of subconscious excavation, attempting to wrap viewers up in a heist-like adventure. It's a bold, unflinching movie of hitherto seemingly impossible technical brilliance.",10,1,3,17 March 2015
Stalag 17," An Occasionally Biting but Rousingly Entertaining Black Comedy!
","Stalag 17, Billy Wilder's adaptation of the 1951 Broadway hit, is a rowdily entertaining prisoner of war movie, screened as a lusty comedy-melodrama, loaded with gallant, masculine humor and the original's uninhibited earthiness The film surrounds the inhabitants of one of the myriad prisoner of war camps established by Germany during World War II â€“ Stalag 17. When two American prisoners, attempting to escape from the camp, run into a German ambush led by German commandant, Von Scherbach (Otto Preminger), it becomes clear to the men in the barrack that they have an informer in their midst. Suspicion fastens on master trader Sergeant Sefton (William Holden), a charismatic, slick-talking yet cynical loner who irritates his camp-mates because he brazenly makes swaps and takes odds on who's going to live or die. All the men in the barracks start to suspect him of trading more than cigarettes and silk stockings with the Germans. A second betrayal seems to confirm their suspicions and he is beaten up by the men mercilessly. Of course, we're certain from the beginning that Sefton isn't the guilty party. Our cocky black- marketeer however, refuses to play the patsy and resolves to expose the traitor before embarking on his own bid for freedom. Set entirely within a WWII German prison camp for American servicemen, this serio-comedy depicts in a raw, edgy, and humorous way their daily existence, defined by cruel ironies, prickling situations, jousting schemes, rivalry feuds and oneupmanship games. Like a lot of Wilder's oeuvre, Stalag 17 is open about the comic side of lust, and that frankness, however slight, still sounds refreshingly adult. Wilder uses a suspense approach with plenty of leavening humorous byplay springing from the confinement of healthy young males. He superbly balances elements of drama, satire and comedy, and captures the claustrophobia of camp life. He also manages to extract a wonderful performance from his cast, including a truly award-winning turn by William Holden as the cocky, self- serving American prisoner and Otto Preminger, who relishes his part as a nasty Nazi.Stalag 17 has a certain humanity and realism that involves you with the intensity of its settings. Like all of Wilder's works, it is not transparently jaded, preachy or egocentric but an astounding blend of revelatory, entertaining and riveting.",9,0,3,16 April 2015
The Shawshank Redemption," Shawshank Redeems Cinema and How!
","Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free â€“ These words inscribed on the poster of The Shawshank Redemption sum up what's at stake in Frank Darabont's chef-d'oeuvre. The Shawshank Redemption shows us that there is hope even within the restricted walls of a prison.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)is a prominent banker wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her paramour, who spends many years in the Shawshank prison. He forges an unforgettable friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), a veteran of the penal system, who helps him to cope with the frightening realities of prison life. While the prison walls shield Red and the other prisoners from the depredations of an ever-changing world, it has the exact opposite effect on Dufresne, who exploits every possible opportunity to bring a taste of the outside world to himself and his fellow convicts. Their bond forms the backbone of the film.Tim Robbins is right at the top of his game as he paints a fascinating portrait of an unjustly incarcerated inmate and brings an innate humanity to Stephen King's principal character. Freeman is exceptional as Red and his narrative much of which is taken verbatim from King's story, holds the story together and like a skilled conductor, waves a baton to orchestrate our emotions.Frank Darabont uses his powers as a supreme storyteller and an astonishing craftsman to breathe life into a genre that I thought had been dead since The Great Escape. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, masterfully told. The film's greatest triumph is its earnestness that makes even those moments that might have felt slushy, achieve the dignity of genuine tragedy. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope that can reduce the most hardened into misty-eyed wonderment.The Shawshank Redemption warrants repeated viewing!",10,1,1,18 March 2015
Platoon," Platoon is a Film of Inspiring Empathy and Implacable Force!
","There are no grandstanding heroics in Oliver Stone's 'Platoon'. No back-patting reassurances that the Vietnam War was ever remotely considered a noble cause. This film is an act of courage. Stone, the gutsy writer-director, records in a devastating barrage of images the relentless horror and the senseless carnage experienced by far too many Americans in Vietnam. The movie is, in fact, so emotionally powerful that you can practically feel the same gnawing fear that can bring out the savagery in the most decent young men. Platoon, to a large extent, is a replay of his own harrowing, wartime experiences - Stone was a medal-decorated former 'grunt' who served with the 25th Infantry in Vietnam.From the very first shot - where newly arrived troops recoil at the sight of body bags being loaded onto their returning plane - you plunge directly into a blazing jungle inferno. The film is structured as a Dantesque descent into hell, following the progress of a young foot soldier, Chris Taylor (a commendable Charlie Sheen), as he penetrates further and further into the blind terror that is his experience of the war. Chris, as Stone himself was, is a well-to-do college dropout who volunteered for Vietnam out of a sense of patriotism and a vague desire to prove himself as a man. He's expecting a WWII movie; what he finds instead is a nightmare. It's a war where there seems to be no master plan, no big picture and no advances. There is only terror, bone-deep exhaustion, nighttime patrols and the humid jungle, crawling with snakes, insects and the silent Viet Cong. This is, unquestionably, what Vietnam must have felt like to the foot soldiers.The movie, with its hallucinatory, nightmarish visual quality, captures the moral confusion and the increasing disintegration of soldiers who escape by getting stoned together. This mercilessly intense movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. The atmosphere remains highly charged from beginning to end. There's no letup, nary a suggestion of humor to break the tension. It's not unlike an Indonesian shadow play in the sense that the evil god, scar-faced Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger, his face a road-map of scars, extremely dynamic as the fighting machine), collides head-on with his moral pole- a heroic God fearing man, the disillusioned Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe making a strong impression). There are images in Platoon so powerful that they seem, rather than simply imprinted on celluloid, to have been burned into memory. This bold combat movie projects Vietnam with such ferocity that no one can ever doubt that that war was indeed anything but a living hell.Decades later, Platoon remains an intriguing blend of the political and the personal, with Stone turning his memories and his opinions about Vietnam into a potent drama. Platoon continues to be lauded as a film of inspiring empathy and implacable force!",9,3,4,20 December 2015
Paths of Glory," The 'Paths of Glory' Lead But to The Grave!
","Right at the beginning of Stanley Kubrick's World War I epic 'Paths of Glory', we are placed right amongst a troop of worn-out French soldiers, led by Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas, in splendid form), dug into their trenches and their morally corrupt commanders – both trying to hold off the Germans. Exasperated by the stalemate, the French supreme commander orders Colonel Dax's troops to do the impossible – launch a suicidal assault on a strategic hill – the Anthill. Even though he thinks the idea sounds insane, Dax is in no position to decline the directive and commands his men to charge to their likely doom. The soldiers are indeed like ants on the Anthill, stomped mercilessly by larger unseen forces. When the operation ends in inevitable retreat, their commanding general, himself largely responsible for the fiasco, wants an entire company to face execution. France needs a sacrifice, as if it hadn't bled enough. Eventually, three men are chosen at random to face court-martial for 'cowardice', as an example to others. The decision brings Dax, himself a defense lawyer in peacetime, into conflict with his superior officers, as he tries to assert reason during wartime for those on trial against an apathetic panel of military judges, even as the three men await execution. Can Colonel Dax save the men from the trumped-up charges of pusillanimity and eventually from the firing squad?Over the years, Kubrick's WWI saga has attained a status commensurate with its meticulous craftsmanship and unfortunately timeless message. The movie is visually alluring from the start, whether it is when the camera is patrolling the trenches during the frighteningly vivid warfare or pacing the courtroom during the trial scenes in the latter half. Corrosively antiwar, the film is indeed pointed, but its contempt is directed not at war per se but rather at the manner in which war is conducted. For the movie is fundamentally an attack on bureaucracy and its attendant rigidity, hypocrisy and cumulative ineffectiveness. If that sounds dull or, worse, didactic, rest assured that in the hands of Stanley Kubrick, it is no such thing. Kubrick almost scornfully illustrates the consequences of unchecked ambition and mass complacency, as high- ranking officers calmly plot the basest turpitude, far from the muck of the trenches. It serves as a reminder both of his extraordinary formal virtuosity and his powers as a satirist.With Paths of Glory, Kubrick sits himself down to brood on the meaning of 'courage' and 'honor' in war. Decades later, it continues to be hailed as a devastating body-blow that reminds us that the true horror of war is the endless futility of it.",9,0,2,22 April 2015
Back to the Future Part II," This One Fires the Flux Capacitor 'Back' Up - Straight 'to the Future'!
","Back to the Future Part II begins where Part I left off, in 1985 at the Hill Valley home of teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, who is an absolute hoot in quintuple roles). Marty's scientist friend, Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd, back again in his signature performance), has just arrived with dire news of the future. So Marty and Doc settle back in the time-hopping DeLorean (you know, the one with the flux capacitor) and the new film skips ahead thirty years to 2015, to find Marty's son, Marty Jr., getting in some trouble with Griff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), the grandson of Marty's 1955 nemesis Biff. This situation resolves itself fairly quickly, but not before old Biff steals the time machine to go back to 1955 and present his teenage self with a copy of a sports almanac that the young man uses to make himself a billionaire, turning 1985 into an altered hellish nightmare fantasy - Marty's dad is dead and Biff Tannen is married to Marty's mom, Lorraine. Marty and Doc, protected somehow from the effects of the change - though for how long, it's hard to say - head to 1955 themselves to stop Biff from changing the time-line. Naturally enough, this leads to both of them interacting, in potentially dangerous ways, with the plot of the first movie.It says quite a lot about director Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale's enduring strengths that what I just wrote makes absolutely perfect sense while you're watching it. And that all the jerry-rigged elements concocted at the end of the movie harmonize rather effortlessly with the original, turning casual gags into clever foreshadowing and building recurring motifs out of one-liners, while also providing a fine story that hangs together and is perfectly effective on its own. It's in 2015 that most of the whiz-bang awesomeness of the movie is found, not just in the staggeringly over-detailed production design - skateboards are replaced by flying hover-boards, the Jaws series is up to number 19 and the Chicago Cubs finally win another series - but in Zemeckis' embrace of technological gewgaws. The film knows just how, and when, to entertain us, and it does so in spades.Zemeckis takes the sequel narrative and splices it into the intricate web of the first feature. The first two Back to the Futures ask a number of unresolved and unresolvable questions about causality, order, and intention; and taken as a pair, they're a hell of a lot of fun. That's what separates a top-drawer talent like Zemeckis from a routine hack: he can make an entertaining trifle meant to sell popcorn, and still infuse it with all kinds of structural inquiry.Back to the Future Part II is simultaneously an entertaining follow-up to Part I and a tantalizing introduction to Part III - a giddily and merrily mind-boggling sci-fi fantasy.",9,1,1,8 February 2016
Raging Bull," An Oddly Rousing Chronicle of the 'Bronx-Bull'!
","Unequivocally unsentimental in every respect, Raging Bull offers a searing character study of boxer Jake La Motta (known as the Raging Bull). Despite being the story of a middle-weight boxer, the movie refuses to be pigeonholed as merely a 'boxing' movie. It reigns as poesy of spectacle and presents a disconcerting vision of a beastly character, who dished out savagery in the ring and also at home, yet rose in his day to be idolized to a certain extent by our pop culture.Robert De Niro stars as Jake LaMotta, the Bronx-based boxer whose public bouts and private demons Raging Bull chronicles with bruising acuity, without judgment or sympathy. It delves even deeper into the psyche, exploring the destructive life in whimsical detail. Taking us through the highlight reel of LaMotta's life from the early 1940s through the mid-1960s, the film details how the Bronx bruiser boxed his way to professional stardom then lost everything to debilitating paranoia only to find his life in shambles, eventually descending into self-loathing and loneliness. It is a mesmerizing exploration of the mind of an emotionally disconnected man; as likely to crush those he loved as much as his opposition in the ring. It's impossible to resist following such a talented born loser on his inevitable trip into oblivion, though it's not fun. Watching his downfall from champion to pitiful stand-up comedian and club owner is no more enjoyable than it sounds, yet it is immensely rewarding. One of the triumphs of Martin Scorsese's direction comes from how fascinating Jake remains despite his conspicuous inner rage and crippling sense of sexual insecurity. These inner struggles dovetail with La Motta's performance in the ring, and the film's artful, seemingly improvisatory construction serves to juxtapose these two worlds: the intimate, naturalistic domestic world and the smoky, expressionistic world of the boxing ring. The most obvious basis for the film's claim to greatness lies in Scorsese's devastating critique of the basic codes of masculinity and finally in Robert De Niro's performance, through which that critique is made flesh. De Niro's colossal act (astounding not in the least for his now famous weight gain) firmly holds the film together, virtually hypnotizing the viewer with intensity, pathos, and even innocence. The true power of De Niro's performance rests in his ability to crawl his way into this lug's twisted psyche and air out his personal demons for all to see. It will be impossible to look away from your screens, much like a real boxing match. And for that, Raging Bull remains a profoundly treasured experience: bold and bloody, yet oddly stirring. What eventually pours out on the screen is pure cinema, and pure Scorsese!",9,2,2,26 March 2015
Shrek," Shrek Maybe Ugly But Here He Sparkles with Charm and Irreverence!
","Shrek (Mike Myers) is a green, obnoxious ogre who bathes (and gargles) in mud, is notoriously flatulent and makes a candle out of his earwax. He knows perfectly well he's not welcome in polite society and just wants is to be left alone in his swamp. But Shrek has a couple of problems. One is a stubborn, trash-talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has latched onto him and the other is the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow, subtly underplaying), who has dumped all the disenfranchised fairytale creatures of the land in Shrek's backyard. So the Seven Dwarfs hauling a dead Snow White around in her glass casket, the Three Bears, Pinocchio, the Big Bad Wolf and a horde of other beloved Disney characters turn up in the swamp of our misanthropic ogre and spoil his view with their squalid refugee camp. Shrek cuts a deal with the nasty Lord to get his solitude back: Rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz, surprisingly amazing) from the castle guarded by a fire-breathing dragon and his land will be cleared of the squatters. So the reluctant ogre goes on his quest, with the yammering Donkey at his side. They encounter the dragon, which has a soft spot for donkeys, and rescue Fiona so that she can marry Farquaad. Things then get complicated, and quite adorable, as Shrek finds a soft spot for the lady. But the Princess does not only have real chemistry with the ogre, but also a dark secret of her own.Some wise guys sure had a blast making Shrek. That's certain. You can feel the snap, crackle and the pop of creation here as talented animators take a classic story and twist it to make fun of both fairy tales and the Disney behemoth. No one has attempted to take the starch out of these beloved icons, never with such wicked glee. 'Though she lives with seven men, she's not easy!' barks Shrek about Snow White while Cinderella is called 'a mentally abused shut-in' – with riotous irreverence, they lampoon every once-sacred characteristic of the nursery kingdom. Whether any of this is actionable is for the courts to decide. But in the court of public opinion, it's hilarious! You can almost picture the makers giggling as they come up with non-stop wisecracks, stopping only to groove on the computer images they've made. From the lush countryside that Shrek roams through, to the amazing, textured faces on each of its characters, Shrek is a stunning achievement. The animation is used subtly and intelligently, with great humor, never pushing things further than the technology will allow. Its musical scenes are unusually powerful, its wit remarkably vicious, its central love story genuinely touching.What gives Shrek its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue, delivered by vocally charismatic performers. Shrek may be a mean, green halitosis machine, but it doesn't take long to love him, warts and all, thanks to Mike Myers who reprises his Scottish accent to great comic effect. Eddie Murphy steals every scene he's in with equal parts bounce and warmth as the yakky Donkey and practically gallops off with the movie.With improbable finesse, Shrek buffs up some of the oldest tropes of storytelling and then gives them a mischievous tilt, so that we appear to be watching a celebration of a genre and a sneaky subversion of it at the same time. It is an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication!",9,2,4,10 February 2016
The Silence of the Lambs," You Will be Led Into This Hypnotic Thriller Like 'Lambs' to the Slaughter!
","Jonathan Demme's hypnotic adaptation The Silence of The Lambs, has a solemnity that's been entirely lacking in horror movies lately. Demme's film is frightening on both visceral and intellectual levels, inviting favorable comparison with unnerving classics of the genre. Ingénue FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is sent to interview, the profoundly mad yet seemingly sane psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to prise clues about another serial killer dubbed 'Buffalo Bill', who has left a rash of unsavory murders along his trail. The killer is abducting corpulent young women, then mutilating them and dumping their bodies. Clarice summons all her courage to face the sadistic shrink, but Lecter has a commanding presence. Relishing the superiority of his intellect, he instantly recognizes her true vulnerability, watching with a self-satisfied smirk as Clarice struggles to maintain her professional composure. Still, there's a glimmer of admiration as Lecter examines Clarice with his penetrating eyes. He offers to help catch the serial killer (who is now holding the daughter of a U.S. senator hostage) but to learn what he knows, Clarice has to engage in his dangerous mind games. Forced to confront her own childhood fears, she hangs on like a terrier until he imparts a vital clue.The Silence of the Lambs is a movie without unnecessary excess, with all its facets merging perfectly in the telling of the tale. Its ghastliness is more psychological than visual, but there is enough of both varieties to shake up almost anyone. It forces us to look at things we would rather not see but it continues to have a vise- like grip on us. But the true strength of the movie lies in its exploration of a place beyond physical revulsion - in the darkest corners of the souls of both the hunters and the hunted. Jonathan Demme exercises a great level of restraint in the midst of portraying madness, running the gamut of emotions while still capturing a clever wit and a searing intelligence. He implicates the audience, dragging us into a vicarious conspiracy with a murderer.But no comment about this film is complete without a mention of the lead cast. Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter is a visual treat; a remarkably lucid portrait of lunacy. As the steely-eyed psychopath, Hopkins plays Lecter with such magisterial authority, that you can almost sense the actor relishing the part. What makes him more than your everyday villain is the piercing intelligence and irresistible charm he brings to the role. Jodie Foster imbues Clarice Starling with such humanity that one can't help but feel connected to her and her pain. It is a testament to her abilities that she holds her own against her scene-stealing co-star. The Silence of the Lambs remains in our minds not only because it frightens, but because it probes and penetrates, tickling our minds while also making our hearts race. A powerfully compelling cinematic experience!",10,1,2,31 March 2015
X-Men: First Class," 'X-Men: First Class' Makes The Grade!
","X-Men: First Class unfolds by deliciously setting up the yin-and-yang between the mutant population's two most powerful people. On the one hand is Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), who is eager to help mutants like himself - he's a telepath - and his shape-shifting best friend Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) and seek acceptance from non-mutant humans. On the other hand is the metal-manipulating Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender), who's bent on destroying the former Nazi scientist (Kevin Bacon) responsible for killing his mother in the Warsaw ghetto in 1944.Set primarily in 1962, the script sets up Charles and Erik as allies. Their mission is to stop that Nazi doctor, now a businessman named Sebastian Shaw who also has mutant energy-absorbing powers and has gathered his squad of mutants, from pushing the Americans and Soviets into launching a nuclear war. But in battling Shaw, Charles and Erik also argue between themselves. Charles seeks acceptance of mutants from humans, even encouraging his lab genius to create a serum to make mutants appear 'normal.' Erik takes a more radical stance, arguing mutants should never have to hide who they are and should fight humans, even the more sympathetic ones.Using the Cuban Missile Crisis as a backdrop, X-Men: First Class delivers a riveting action drama, mixing whiz-bang special effects with a story of Shakespearean proportions, and in the process writing a fascinating mutant-based alternative history of the early 1960s. Dropping a genre film in the middle of a historic event immediately and successfully adds depth, substance and helps place the characters in the proper chronology.On the acting front, McAvoy's Professor X is more relatable than Patrick Stewart's in the original trilogy. He is still as much a genius, but maintains his boyish charm and an accessibility that has yet to have been afforded to X's character. Fassbender similarly takes his Magneto to a new place, trading the campiness of Ian McKellen's character and focusing more instead on Erik' anguish and tragic past, delivering a standout performance. Together they provide a wonderful centerpiece for the film with their two characters, displaying some great chemistry.But the glue that holds the whole film together and balances everything on a thin wire like a stage magician is Matthew Vaughn. He keeps the complex globe-hopping story moving fluidly, peppered with moments of good humor and high drama. The movie deals with the age old dilemma of power over peace, but credit is deserved to Vaughn for managing this aspect so attentively, and being delicately precise with the emotional baggage involved. Most superhero movies would not even attempt to cover a subject like this with such a high maturity level.Whether or not you're an avid fan of the comic book series, this class graduates with top marks!",9,0,0,11 January 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight 'Rises' on the Wings of Nolan's Untamed Imagination!
","The Dark Knight Rises arrived in cinemas on the back of deafening hype. The astronomical expectations seemed insurmountable for even a visionary of Christopher Nolan's caliber. So does Nolan deliver? Absolutely! Bold and unflinching, Nolan's operatic style makes The Dark Knight Rises an art piece of boundless spectacle and an epic of never-seen-before scope and scale. It visually obliterates the modern blockbuster with a story of daring boldness, taking your inner child on a savage ride.The final chapter of Nolan's trilogy kicks off exactly eight years after the end of The Dark Knight. The streets of Gotham have been cleaned up but as we soon find out, all that means is that the criminals have moved underground. Having taken the fall for the death of Harvey Dent, Bruce Wayne, the tycoon behind the cowl, now lives like a specter hobbling about the recesses of his fancy mansion while his faithful butler Alfred frets over him like a gawking mother goose. But something is stirring deep beneath Gotham's streets, and it is not long before Wayne once again finds himself staring into the heart of human darkness. When a hulking, masked psycho named Bane lays siege to his financial empire and plants a series of strategically placed explosives beneath the city, intending to cut off the isle's citizenry from the outside world, he hauls the bat-suit out of storage.From there, the movie unfolds with the carefully measured pacing of an epic, that rare sequel that endeavors to deepen and expand upon what has come before rather than merely repackaging it. It returns us to Gotham and its denizens, taking its time, gradually showing us the lay of the land. And once the cogs start whirring and the machine starts to warm up, The Dark Knight Rises takes off like a rocket – with Hans Zimmer's propulsive score as its fuel. And when it fires on all cylinders, it enters classic territory.The pedigree of the cast imparts automatic gravitas to the movie. Christian Bale gives us a Batman with a haunted quality, showing Wayne broken, rising, and risen in perfect succession. Gary Oldman retains his quiet dignity as Commissioner Gordon. Michael Caine's Alfred continues to class up the joint. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is sexy, confident, and offers a great balance of humor. As Officer John Blake, Joseph Gordon-Levitt musters an interesting blend of earnestness and intensity. Both Marion Cotillard and Morgan Freeman execute their parts with precision. And Hardy is sensational as the diabolical antagonist Bane. He bites into his character's motivations and transcends the movie to a place that is darker and more malicious.Nolan gives us an intellectual, heart-pounding movie that grips like a vice from minute one and never lets go, capping off the trilogy with passion and dignity and with slam-bang entertainment. The Dark Knight Rises is both the conclusion the franchise needs and the conclusion it deserves!",10,2,4,2 April 2015

The whole gang gets caught in an odyssey of compounded indignities and the misunderstanding consigns the toys to Sunnyside Daycare, presented as a heavenly vision of constant, collective ownership and communal living.

Trainspotting," 'Trainspotting' is like Speeding Through The Digestive Tract of An Insatiable Beast!
","Trainspotting is a rambling chronicle of high times in low company. By turns cheeky, surreal, exhilarating and stomach-churning, it follows assorted days in the lives of mangy Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor who is absolutely brilliant as the smart-aleck junkie) - a degenerate boil on society's backside - and the scabby crew of junkies, deadbeats, thieves, liars and nut jobs he calls friends. These characters are not duped by evil drug pushers, but consciously choose drugs over the banality of well, pretty much everything else. But these personalities, like the settings — bile green apartment walls and the blood red den of their dealer - are stylized and get a sudden and shocking reality injection straight after a catalog of hilariously catastrophic encounters. Renton tries to get his life back on the rails, but the nightmares of his past follow him even to London where he snatches despair from the very jaws of hope. Fittingly, he and his unwelcome flat-mates return briefly to their Edinburgh roots to bury another heroin statistic, before a coach trip back south for an amateurish, pathetic drug deal - selling rather than buying, for once, and for one last thrill. It all goes pear-shaped, naturally, and no one is surprised, because by now the message is sinking in: heroin is for losers!But in the hands of Danny Boyle and the fantastic cast, it is possible to receive that message as an unprecedented and unrivaled piece of entertainment – it would be hard to imagine a movie about drugs, depravity, and all-around bad behavior more electrifying than Trainspotting. Though the bulk of the humor is blacker than a raven's wing at midnight, Boyle's sense of humanity persistently creeps in around the edges making the movie a singular sensation. While getting the squalor and degradation of the junkie lifestyle down to the last grotesque detail, he captures the stoned-out, gut-sickening experience of hardcore addiction with hallucinogenic acuity.The film is peppered with harrowing sequences where you will find yourself trapped between a belly-laugh and a scream, as the characters rail, chuckle, shout and dive into darkness. Sample the scene where Renton loses some suppositories down a toilet in a squalid off-track-betting washroom and dives into the crud-encrusted porcelain after them, suddenly swimming through the clear waters of his opiated imaginings. Buoyed by a great Brit Pop soundtrack, agile cinematography and rich, earthy dialogue that gushes like a ruptured sewer, etching characters deeper than any laughter lines -''Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand, and you're still nowhere near it,'' reports Renton, describing his high – such scenes make the movie a searing pop-art portrait of a lost generation blowing out its brains.All in all, Danny Boyle's Trainspotting is a blast of ice-cold water across a sweaty brow where the bleak subject matter is presented as a hilariously funny walk on the wild side, with no moral stance taken or punches pulled.",9,0,1,4 February 2016
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Wes Anderson's Gleeful Stop-Motion Animation is No 'Fox Paw'!
","Wes Anderson's cool quirks and characteristics follow him into the land of stop-motion animation with Fantastic Mr. Fox, an eye-popping, hilarious adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book.It's the timeless tale of Mr. Fox (George Clooney), who has enjoyed a life of doing what foxes do best: prowling for fowl. A prologue finds the dashing rapscallion and his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep) raiding a poultry farm. After they get ensnared by a trap, Felicity announces that she's pregnant, and our plucky fox finds himself trapped in a different sort of cage: parental responsibility. Mr. Fox, after promising his wife he wouldn't thieve anymore, settles into a humdrum life as a newspaper columnist. But he can't suppress his natural friskiness for long.In an attempt to reclaim some thrills and escape the daily doldrums, he plans 'one last heist' (we've heard that before). The mark: a dastardly trio of farmers - Boggis, Bunce and Bean, whose delectable deposits of chickens, ducks and cider are too delicious to deny. After Mr. Fox makes a mockery of their security by plotting daring - and quite humorous - night raids of their farms, the trio combines forces and goes on the offensive to kill their furry nemesis. The critters burrow deep into the Earth and capture the attention of local media. As the farmers amp up their machinations to bring an end to their clever rival, the animal community is dragged into this war of wits and survival, as Mr. Fox tries to find a way to save his family and friends.As the voice of Mr. Fox, Clooney gives a wry nod and sly wink of a performance, while Streep slips so easily into the vocal role as his stern but loving wife, you don't notice her presence. The entire cast, that also includes Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, seems to be having so much fun you cannot help but imagine them sipping martinis during the voice recordings. While the performances make Fantastic Mr. Fox enthralling and overwhelmingly heartwarming, it's the film's splendid, old-fashioned stop-motion visuals that will win hearts. Wes Anderson's team boundlessly, buoyantly fill each frame with fine flourishes. Each intricately orchestrated frame feels like a gloriously animated page of a picture book. Landscapes resemble carpet remnants and fire extinguishers plume what looks like cotton candy. The adorable animals and the gorgeous environment displayed in the film seem like the felt patches of a children's book that are intended to be caressed against your cheek and held close to your chest. It not only looks scruffily beautiful, but it's hilariously off-balance, warm-hearted, perfectly composed and detailed and casually but meaningfully acted. This last feat is again the result of Anderson's inscrutable perfectionism.The film incorporates all the quiet, improvisational style, dry humor delivery as found in Anderson's cinema, but combined with the proletarian fluidity of the animation; the result for audiences is a gleeful trance-like holiday. Wes Anderson's stop-motion animation is perhaps the purest distillation yet of his nerveless twee cinema of quirk.",9,0,0,31 January 2016
Rear Window," Rear Window is a Rarity - Even by Hitchcockian Standards!
","Rear Window is an intriguing, brilliant, chilling Hitchcockian study of obsessive human curiosity and voyeurism. It plays as the ultimate guilty pleasure treat (comparing the viewer to a voyeur who sits in the dark judging what he sees while being unobserved) and an extended metaphor to the illusory workings of the cinema. The premise echoes the director's simple but lucrative narrative launching points. Jeff (James Stewart) is an action-hungry photographer who has spent several weeks in isolation, as a result of a broken leg that has relegated him to a wheelchair in his New York apartment. His social interactions are limited to his sarcastic massage therapist Stella (the deliciously acerbic Thelma Ritter) and a romantic interest with an unqualified patience (the marvelous Grace Kelly). From his apartment window overlooking a closed courtyard, the audaciously observant Jeff peeks at the busy lives of an assemblage of suburban tenants in perplexed fascination and witnesses everyone's dirty linen: suicide, broken dreams, and cheap death! There is an unsettling resonance in what his eyes and ears absorb. During a particularly humid night while Jeff drifts in and out of slumber, the foreboding figures across the yard are heard and seen in lightning-fast increments. There is a spine-tingling scream followed by stoic silence. The husband leaves the apartment in the dead of night, seemingly shaken, only to return later. By the following morning the wife is no longer seen from Jeff's vantage point, but where did she go?Alfred Hitchcock crafts one of his most intelligently thrilling films (a sadistic pleasure in meddling in the questionable private lives of others), adapting an incredible tale of pure misanthropy. All those characters we glimpse across from Jeff's window are real people, given dimension by basic but brilliant filmmaking techniques. The most remarkable aspect is the way that it is filmed: the camera never strays from inside Stewart's apartment, and you never really realize that while watching the film. The screenplay by John Michael Hayes is an insightful amalgamation of character and behavior, and the dialogue is wonderfully used to accentuate details. Also, due mention is rightfully reserved for the three lead actors (Stewart, Kelly and Ritter) who play the material with orthodox conviction, as if oblivious to the monumental profundity stirring beneath them. Rear Window has an infectious and savage charm that leaps beyond even the highest of expectations. What's more, it is also a vivid reminder of who Hitchcock was and continues to be: the quintessential voice of audacity in an industry starved for the guidance of progressive voices. Rear Window is a joy from start to finish!",9,1,3,24 March 2015
300," 300 is Zack Snyder's Valentine to Violence!
","Once in a while, a movie comes along that's so extraordinarily butch, it makes even the most pumped-up gym-jockeys look like spaghetti-armed girls. Zack Snyder's 300 is just that! It is an absolute beast of a film, glistening with sweat and other homo-erotic juices, almost drowning in a sea of testosterone.300 tells the story of 300 Spartans led by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) into the face of an insurmountable invasion at the hands of a million-man Persian army. The Spartans are proud and pure people, who raise their young on the battlefield to ensure their men grow into strong warriors to protect their land. When demi-god Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) makes clear his intentions to raze Sparta to the ground, King Leonidas decides that rather than allow his nation to be conquered into slavery, he must take his best warriors, the Spartan elite, and do what he can to fend off the impending invasion. Picking up on that incensed energy, he leads just 300 of his finest warriors to meet the million soldiers of the Persian army in a fierce battle for survival.From there the film explodes into a highly stylized, intense battle-royale in which the Spartans (all sporting six packs you could bounce a brick off), with their flare for battle and their constant arrogance, take on the vast Persian army led by Xerxes. The battle scenes themselves are something to behold, they are pulse pounding and intense yet not chaotic. Everything is slightly hyper-real, so expect jets of crimson to soak the screen, ninja-style leaps, giant ogres with axes and crazed war rhinos taking chunks out of each other in battle. It's all wonderfully OTT, but as the encroaching armies are gradually worn down and start to lose their heads, it's a deliciously macabre spectacle. In the hands of director Zack Snyder, 300 is a hurricane blast of epic energy - two solid hours of big, beefy men stabbing each other and yelling 'Raaargh!' as loud as they can. He brilliantly recreates Frank Miller's source material, shooting it with a visual flair in a palette so stylized that it might as well be animation. The glorification of the body, the de-humanized enemy, the sheer relentless carnage presented as poetry and ballet - 300 is almost fascistic in its devotion to war and heroism.Of the cast, it is Gerard Butler who clearly steals the show from the rest. He does more than just shout to his men prior to an impending surge - he is charismatic, irreverent and ultimately embodies the vision of a Spartan warrior. Resplendent in his scarlet robe and six-pack, Butler's warrior king brings both a sense of humor and a brooding intelligence to the slaughter.300 is a valentine to violence, hilariously macho and eye-poppingly homo-erotic. Grab your Spartan helmet, sword and shield, it is time to kick some ass!",9,1,4,26 August 2015
The Great Escape," The Great Escape is A Great Deal of Fun And - In Itself - A Kind Of Escape!
","At a Luftwaffe-run high-security WWII prison camp somewhere in Germany, a group of Allied officers plot one of the most inordinately ambitious escape attempts ever hatched. Not just a dozen or two, but 250 men are planning to escape. Each man contributes his expertise. British Squadron leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough) nicknamed Big X designs the plan, which involves digging three tunnels at once with Charles Bronson as the 'chief digger', despite his lifelong claustrophobia. James Coburn is the 'manufacturer,' who invents a way to keep air flowing through the tunnels. James Garner plays the 'scrounger', whose job is to get a hold of things like picks and shovels as well as ID badges and documents. Donald Pleasance is a 'forger' who prepares the fake documents the prisoners will need once they escape. Finally, we have Steve McQueen playing Hilts, who spends most of his time in the cooler, bouncing his baseball against the wall and is ready to go through the tunnel to get important information, and then allow himself to be recaptured so he can give them the information. With its luxurious three hours, The Great Escape deliberately details all the ins and outs, the successes and pitfalls of the plan. We learn how the diggers get rid of the excess dirt. We learn where the wood comes from to brace the tunnels. We see how the scrounger makes friends with - and double-crosses - the guards to get what he wants from the outside. The escape itself occurs in the middle of the film, and the way it is shot is absolutely gripping. The cast is a cavalcade of tough guys from 1960, offering a fantastic ensemble - a punchy cast with the moxy you'd expect from a group of officers trying to buck the system.Unlike other prison camp movies, it does not dwell on disputes between prisoners or on the deprivations, which seems almost comfortable. The story gives us an exceptional example of professionalism, courage, resourcefulness, teamwork, and loyalty of every one of the prisoners. But, it is not one bit preachy. It is in fact, an absurdly fun movie to watch: it says very little about the human condition but it doesn't ever sag for long enough to let you notice that fact. John Sturges' genius is that he presents each detail of the plan with all the excitement of a major set-piece: he understands the human tendency towards curiosity in how things work and rewards it by lingering over every step in the process. Elmer Bernstein's exemplary score helps a great deal. He lays on the dread when Sturges forgets about it, and ramps up the suspense when necessary with a rollicking, jingoistic collection of iconic marches and leitmotifs that give the film a bouncy momentum that carries us through.It is, when all is said and done, a mechanical film: but god, what a beautiful machine!",9,1,3,14 January 2016
Sin City," Sin City is One Guilty Pleasure Trip!
","In 2005, Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller joined forces in an audacious synthesis - a triptych of film noir adapted from a series of graphic novels – to bring us a world where the villains are ineffably evil, the heroes are compromised, and the city is filled with corruption while mayhem and mischief run amok. The plot, having the direct-action vividness suitable for a video game, is ingeniously constructed in three labeled chapters – 'The Hard Goodbye', 'The Big Fat Kill' and 'That Yellow Bastard'. It takes us into the heart of the dark, grimy Basin City, where crime and depravity are a way of life, through three stories about heroes battling overwhelming odds that circle around each other, amplify each other, and ultimately intersect. Sin City is a world of shadows, captured in beautiful arctic-white and inkblot-black visuals, where the sun never seems to rise. The makers send their heroes into such labyrinthine hells that it would have been depressing if it weren't so much fun. Frank Miller's potent black humor translates easily to the screen and lifts the often grim subject matter, keeping the film entertaining through the darkest of landscapes. Into this frenzied mix, Robert Rodriguez brings his own chromatic talents. He borrows Miller's panels in lighting and composition, but adds his own sense of timing and bits of color strategically disrupting the pristine black-and-white gloom. But what makes Sin City a gleefully gory gem is that the relentlessly dark story is balanced by visceral joy of pure noir storytelling. And, make no mistake, this is a dark movie. Aside from being black-and-white, it also features nothing but characters scraped off the underbelly of society - ex-cons, hookers, corrupt cops, general low-lives. Rodriguez drenches it in his usual monsoon of ironic, macho macabre, with his camera salivating over curves and cleavage of tough-dame females. But the strength of Mr. Miller's writing has always been his ability to give these bottom-feeders soul thanks to which Sin City exists precisely on the edge between exploitation and artistic statement, ultimately saving itself from toppling over with the sincerity of its tone, the beauty of its images, and the honor of its heroes.In a film that reaches for the pulpy heights that Sin City does, a lesser cast would be lost, even invisible. But here surprisingly, the cast is neither a distraction nor an aberration. Everyone involved in Sin City not only understands this lurid universe but has a grand time playing in it, especially Mickey Rourke, who captures Marv's subterranean humanity beneath his snarling brutality, using his hungry, manic eyes that peek from behind his freakish disfigurement and Elijah Wood who is the definition of creepy as the mute cannibal Kevin.Sin City is a gleaming pop revelation – an extremely stylish piece of crime drama that is relentlessly entertaining. For those with a penchant for pulp, Sin City is one guilty pleasure.",9,2,5,6 May 2015
True Romance," This is Both - An Irreverent High-Voltage Thriller And A ' Truly Quirky Romance'!
","'True Romance' is a deliciously pulpy romp that saw director Tony Scott bring a burnished visual sheen to an early Quentin Tarantino script. While the title suggests images of hugs, kisses, holding hands, and heartfelt human emotion, the film instead bombards the audience with images of blazing guns, brutal beatings, and lots of gushing blood while telling a twisted and entertaining tale of outlaw lovers on the run.Clarence (Christain Slater in his best role ever) is a comic-book store employee, living a meager but not intolerable life in Detroit. On his birthday night, he meets a pretty blonde hooker named Alabama (Patricia Arquette, reliably efficient and displaying a great chemistry with Slater) and they are soon positively smitten, declaring their love for each other, only to be married a few days later. Clarence goes to see her pimp, Drexl (a truly whacked-out Gary Oldman who devours his ten minutes on screen), with the meeting ending with Clarence killing him and making off with a suitcase. The case, which Clarence thought contained Alabama's clothes, actually contains two-million dollars' worth of cocaine, and this puts this newly-married duo find themselves in quite the thorny predicament. Once the dust - and blood - clears, they decide to trek off to Hollywood to see Clarence's pal who might know some industry folks interested in high-quality coke. Little do they know that Drexl's partners (led by Christopher Walken's quietly malicious Vincenzo) are tracking them and intend to get their merchandise back, eliminating the couple for good measure.True Romance is a paper-thin but enjoyably quirky romance carried by great dialogue, an unpredictable plot, and a cast of wildly original characters. The storyline is far from earth-shattering, but it guarantees some good escapist fun, especially since the script boasts a few scenes possessive of great wit and sparkle, along with a show-stopping one chock-full of dynamic psychological tension – between Dennis Hopper (who brings a phenomenal degree of warmth as Clarence's father) and Christopher Walken, whose 'vendetta kinda mood' head-to-head became one of the most memorable sparrings of cinema. Many people may be turned off by the graphic and sometimes savage violence of True Romance. But that is only part of the dirty, funny and unpredictably violent genius of Mr. Tarantino. Tarantino and Tony Scott never pretend that the film is more than what it is - slickly entertaining trash.Eventually, it is Tarantino's gutter poetry that detonates True Romance. This movie is dynamite - a hip, clever and irreverent high-voltage thriller with nary a dull moment!",9,8,10,13 February 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," A 'Furiously Mad' Pedal to the Metal Action Blockbuster!
","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is apocalypse wow! The fact that it's a fuel-injected adrenaline rush as well as a thoughtful, surprisingly moving film is a combination that makes this fiery blockbuster one of the very best of the genre.The film starts off with a shot reminiscent of The Road Warrior, with our eponymous hero Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) looking away at the desolate wasteland of his shattered world and then it just goes berserk. Max gets himself captured by the underlings of the 'Citadel', a kingdom high inside a lone tower of rock. At the Citadel, chaos reigns among a starving citizenry at the mercy of a mutated leader known as Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a Halloween horror of a man outfitted with protective gear and a gruesome breathing apparatus. We meet his muscle-bound security team and his 'War Boys' – a group of tumor-laden, dying soldiers who fight for him in belief that after-life glories await from their sacrifices. Their present task is sending a big rig to a place called Gastown to fill up with 3,000 gallons of that most precious commodity outside of water. But when one of Joe's lieutenants Imperator Furiosa (a shaven-headed Charlize Theron) takes the truck on a detour with precious cargo - the leader's five wives, one of whom is pregnant, with a view to break them free of Joe's despotic shackles - the chase is on, with war-party vehicles in pursuit and our titular hero as a captive on one of these vehicles. Max bests his captors and reluctantly unites with Furiosa and her company of oppressed females. As far as plot goes, that's about it. 'Fury Road' moves at a frenetic pace from beginning to end, offering brief respites where the viewers can catch their breath to prepare for the next jaw-dropping sequence. Now visualize this image: A pair of 1959 Cadillacs welded together. Or a vintage Plymouth Valiant accessorized with tank treads. And all of them are militarized. Men and women vaulting from one vehicle to another, climbing giant, flexible poles planted in the rear in a frantic orgy of speed and skill.The key to making this all work is in having original director George Miller back for another ride. He returns to the post-apocalyptic wasteland almost three decades later and it's like he's never been away, bringing a spry outlook to his burgeoning vision. On paper, the movie is one extended chase, a high-octane race through desolate desert and narrow canyons, raging to the tune of composer Junkie XL's pounding soundtrack, but Miller frames the trek with impeccable attention to detail. The editing is never hasty or disorienting; even at top speeds the movie brings riveting clarity to each ambush and narrow escape. Going against the grain of digitized sensation, much of what we view is actually happening, staged for the camera with incredible choreographic energy. And the cinematography does the unfathomable: it gives pulsating life to a barren desert, the most unattractive of movie settings. Of the cast, Tom Hardy's note perfect as Max, giving a no-nonsense performance eloquent in its silences. But the film's real emotional core is Charlize Theron's gimlet-eyed Furiosa, scarred by her warrior's life and bent on redemption. Sporting a CGI mechanical arm, face paint and a perma-stern expression, Theron makes for one bad-ass rebel!Mad Max: Fury Road is an act of defiance - a rage against the mindless blockbuster made today. It is visceral, taut, insightful, engrossing, intricate, meticulous, and above all else driven by a creative spirit that sees the material from a space of undaunted enthusiasm.",9,2,12,27 August 2015
Gladiator," A Colossal Performance by Crowe makes this an Epic Thrill-Packer!
","You will swoon with woozy delight over Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic 'Gladiator' - a sweaty, stylish hunk-fest that takes you back to the Roman era. It is so insanely enjoyable and carried off with such dash and chutzpah, that it makes you wonder where this genre has been all your life. Worried about the judgment of history as he ends his days with Rome in a swirl of political instability, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) charges his favorite general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), over his petulant son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) to whip Rome back into shape and return power to the people. Maximus wants no part of the offer and yearns to return to his family. But before this wish can become reality, Commodus intervenes, triggering a series of events that changes the future of the Roman Empire. An attack on Maximus and his family relegates the once-great hero to a shattered, anonymous slave. Purchased by a crafty spectacle promoter, he's trained as a gladiator. The man who once fought for his nation and its ideals now fights to provide thrills to a bloodthirsty mob, constantly enduring Commodus' envy and the ignominy of being a slave. But it is as a slave- gladiator that Maximus finds the way to serve Rome once again, and help deliver on his promise to the late Emperor. Gladiator is film-making at its finest (Ridley Scott in top form), painted on the grandest of canvases, and yet, one which maintains the finest eye for detail. Right from its opening frames of hand-to- hand butchery, Gladiator simply grabs you by the balls and never lets go. On the surface, it's a terrific yarn with rounded characters, agonizing suspense and visceral thrills. Look closer and you'll find rich historical themes, and a harrowing critique of violence as amusement. The depiction of the random savagery amid which the issue has to be confronted is astonishing lending the action sequences an elegiac quality. The atmospherics are so robust that you can almost smell the sweat pouring from the Colosseum as Maximus battles both man and beast for the amusement of the masses. The mob's cheers make a chilling counterpoint to our close-up views of carnage.True, Gladiator is full of arresting splendor and technical virtuosity. But the camera only has eyes for Maximus as Crowe puts a stranglehold on stardom with his performance. The man exudes a physicality comparable to the beasts he has to combat in the arena and holds the screen with such conviction and force you simply can't rip your eyes away from him. Gladiator does indeed deliver the glory that was Rome: a sprawling, enthralling orgy of blood, passion, betrayal and revenge. A gloriously entertaining thrill-packer of truly epic proportions!",9,1,2,27 March 2015
The Pursuit of Happyness," Will Smith's Pursuit of Happ'y'ness will make Your Cockles Feel Plenty Warm!
","Directed by Gabriele Muccino, the intentionally misspelt The Pursuit of Happiness opens in 1981 as we meet Chris Gardner (Will Smith) barely holding on to normal life as a husband, father and seller of bone-density scanners that few doctors need and fewer can afford. We see from the get-go his devotion to his son Christopher (Jaden Smith) and his shoe-leather perseverance with the scanners; we also see his nit-picking, wife Linda (Thandie Newton), who hangs around just long enough to abandon him for a better life back East. Chris copes as best he can: trying to make the rent, failing to make the rent, moving into a motel, trying and failing to make the rent there.A glimpse of hotshot stockbrokers driving hotshot wheels sparks dreams of capitalist glory that Chris pursues despite every conceivable setback. He schmoozes the suits at Dean Witter with his forthrightness and flair for Rubik's Cube. Chris finally wangles himself a six- month internship as a stockbroker, with a long-shot chance for a job at the end. The catch is that there's no pay. Now he's a solo parent, and his son misses mom and the apartment Chris couldn't pay for, and none of the chirpy suits at Dean Witter realize that brisk, affable Chris is scraping by on nerve and small change. We see him rear his son with a nurturing, steadfast love that sustains them both when they've hit bottom on a bed of toilet paper, even enlisting his son's ingenuous imagination to patch their spirits together. Chris is acting on all fronts - cheerfully boosting his son's morale, while pretending nonchalance with his colleagues.In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats and missed opportunities, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. The film is tied together by director Gabriele Muccino's adept direction, which keeps proceedings substantial but never melodramatic as he juggles the disparate story elements with more than enough dexterity. Will Smith gives a selfless performance as Chris Gardner, as he conveys the gradual erosion of a man's self- worth. An actor with almost quantifiable likability, he relinquishes his 'actor-ly' vanity and creates a real, complicated and not always sympathetic figure. He plays Gardener with such wry, resigned matter-of-factness that you can't help but root for him. Unsurprisingly, he has a natural on-screen rapport with Jaden, who is himself absolutely endearing in his role, and their powerful father- son bond is genuinely moving. The Pursuit of Happiness is a go-for-the-gold heart-warmer affirming that anyone can pull himself up by the bootstraps and make something of himself. It's an earnest, modest, heartfelt little ode to paternal love that will warm the cockles of our hearts, and even a recalcitrant Scrooge may sniff back a few salty droplets.",10,1,2,4 May 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Indiana Jones' Last Crusade is Pure Escapist Entertainment!
","Justifiably one of the most indelible adventure films in cinematic history, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is pure escapist entertainment of the highest caliber. In his third adventure, whip- smart archaeologist Indiana Jones has to rescue his dad rather than a damsel in enduring distress, a cunning ploy that deserves a tip of the fedora to those shrewd storytellers – a certain Mr. Steven Spielberg and Mr. George Lucas.Opening with a fantastic prologue revolving around one of Indy's early escapades, the movie immediately takes us to 1938, when Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) discovers that his curmudgeonly father Henry Jones (Sean Connery) has disappeared while tracking the Holy Grail - the cup that legend holds Jesus used at the Last Supper and now contains his blood. But as we soon find out, he is not alone in his quest. He has company in American millionaire Walter Donovan, who believes that a drink from the cup will confer immortality and a slew of Nazis who will kill anyone to win the prize. Soon we find Indy travel halfway around the world to swash-buckle his way through a company of Nazi brutes, to unite with his tweedy, mildly befuddled father. The duo teams up to begin Indiana's last crusade, as they endlessly elude the Nazis in race to capture the Holy Grail. Can the father-son duo save one of the world's most precious relics from Hitler's minions?Steven Spielberg has the truest instincts for keeping an audience visually engaged and at his natural command of the simple mechanics of storytelling, it enables him to evoke a kind of pop transcendence that comes close to the effect of the higher, classical arts. Here, he delivers the action with breathless enthusiasm in a movie bursting with thrilling action set-pieces - Indy discovers catacombs, sways through rat-infested tunnels, finds himself right beside the Fuhrer and even manages to reach the coveted Holy Grail, making the pursuit wonderfully perilous.But it's not the relentless action that you eventually prize in this lavishly executed entertainment. It is the amazing chemistry between its two lead actors that makes it so thoroughly entertaining, never allowing the film to lose sight of the contentious but charming relationship between Indiana and his father. As soon as Connery's Henry welcomes his son's first rescue attempt by addressing him as Junior and they discover they have bedded the same gorgeous Nazi spy, the right note of cantankerousness and grudging affection on both sides is struck. Connery playing against type as a book-wormy professor is solid-gold as Indy's crotchety father. He also brings out the very best in Ford, who is at his charming best as the rugged, macho Indy. The snappy by-play between them adds a wonderful facet to the adventure and together, their timing is impeccable.When Steven Spielberg takes off his serious hat and channels his inner-child, there's no one better at making sheer entertainment. And that is what Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is - pure entertainment!",9,2,3,5 May 2015
Back to the Future," Robert Zemeckis Brings the Sci-Fi/ Fantasy Genre 'Back To' Life!
","Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is a typical teenager growing up in the 80s. He hopes to make a man out of his milquetoast father, the middle-aged George McFly (a deliciously funny sad sack as played by 20-year-old Crispin Glover) who is still groveling at the feet of his former high school classmate, a perpetual bully named Biff. Marty's prim mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) appears to be drowning her frustrations in vodka. The movie does not really catch fire until, when testing out a souped-up DeLorean as a time machine with his eccentric, wide-eyed, wild-haired stork of a mad scientist friend Dr. Emmett 'Doc' Brown (played by the hilariously frazzled Christopher Lloyd), Marty is whisked back to 1955. Here, he comes face to face with his nerdy teenage dad and also his unrecognizably gorgeous mom. After inadvertently causing his own mother to become infatuated with him – who finds him an absolute dreamboat, it is left up to Marty to repair the course of time and ensure that she falls in love with his future father, George or face being erased out of existence altogether. To do so, he gets in touch with a young Doc, who is as much a fish out of water in the past as he is in the present, and persuades him to send him back to 1985. Can he put things right and return to the future before it's too late?Director Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future represents that rare perfect matrimony of everything a film needs to succeed, from the adroit direction, the immaculately styled performances and the scintillating visual effects that never swamp the film. The constituent elements would not operate without the film's biggest triumph – its screenplay – which is among the most economic and brilliantly composed, for there are no disposable lines of dialogue; everything spoken is either cuttingly funny and heartfelt (check Doc excitedly describing the forthcoming high-school dance as 'a rhythmic ceremonial ritual'), or employed to foreshadow a temporal event later in the film.Anchoring it all is Fox's stumbling charm. The boyishly good-looking Fox is charming as the lead, exuding cocksure – yet never arrogant – buoyancy. Lloyd, meanwhile, nails his Einstein-on-acid role perfectly, never venturing too far into caricature, yet spinning the archetypal mad scientist role with a wink and a nod, making it unquestionably his signature performance. Together, they make an idiosyncratic couple, for sure, but a perfect one at that.In Back to the Future, there is an effervescence to the filmmaking, a bubbling, giddy effortlessness that's almost addictive. It's ingenuity, time-traveling twist ups and wonderfully vibrant characters resonate in ways few films ever achieve. It is an unadulterated cinematic experience!",9,2,2,26 August 2015
Cinderella Man," As a True-Grit Tale of Redemption, Cinderella Man Packs a Punch!
","When we first meet our eponymous boxing-hero Jim Braddock (Crowe), he's living the high-life of the roaring '20s as a distinguished boxer. By 1929, after piling up an impressive record in over 40 professional bouts, he lands a title fight. However, what turns out to be worse for his fate than his loss to the champion Tommy Loughran, is the stock market crash later that year, which plunges the country into the Great Depression. Wiped out financially, Braddock and his family - wife Mae (Zellweger) and three kids – are relegated to a cramped basement apartment and he begins to support his family by finding occasional work as a longshoreman. His boxing license is also eventually revoked as our erstwhile champion loses fight after fight and he soon goes on welfare in order to subsist. Soon, his plight becomes a public source of shame, when his being on welfare gets reported in the local tabloids. Somehow summoning up a combination of grace, courage, and confidence in the face of humiliation, Braddock chooses to train again, this time as a heavyweight. When his former manager Joe Gould (Giamatti) gets him a lucrative break as dead-meat for a heavyweight challenger, it kick- starts one of the most remarkable career revivals in sporting history. Beating the odds again and again in a series of surprising upsets, he becomes a source of hope for the common American man by conquering the boxing world, while still struggling through the daily grind of poverty and gets christened as 'Cinderella Man'. With Braddock winning fights in convincing fashion, he is given a shot at the title held by the malicious Max Baer, a vicious fighter who has killed two men in the ring. Does he emerge victorious from this ominous fight, or does this turn out to be the night when the fairytale ends for our 'Cinderella Man'?Ron Howard's Cinderella Man skillfully delivers a primal, heart- pounding satisfaction as he directs this rousing saga with an admirable sense of restraint, which works to underscore the resilience of characters and allows the actors and the story enough time to breathe. His presentation of the bout is dynamic and tense, not giving into histrionic display. He keeps a consistent, sharp tone throughout, not resorting to any overtly sappy moments which many films of this ilk have a tendency to do. Renee Zellweger rises to the challenge and delivers an earnest performance. A delightfully scene-stealing Paul Giamatti shows us the raw excitable emotions that keep breaking the surface of Gould's fast-talking tough-guy facade. But it is Russell Crowe who steals the show with his towering performance. He adopts a flawless period 'Noo-Yawk' accent, a tough guy attitude, and undergoes a physical transformation to look remarkably like Braddock. But he ensures that the character does not fall into these superficial accoutrements and carries the film forward with a kind of quiet dignity only he can.As a true-grit tale of redemption, Cinderella Man lands one solid body punch after another!",9,0,0,23 April 2015
Jurassic Park," The Monster of All Monster Movies!
","The focus of Steven Spielberg's ground-breaking thrill-ride Jurassic Park, is a wondrous island theme park off the coast of Costa Rica populated by genetically engineered dinosaurs, masterminded by billionaire visionary John Hammond (a superlative Richard Attenborough), ready for business as soon as a handful of experts can declare it legally and naturally safe for paying customers. Soon we see a group of scientists head to Isla Nublar including paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), his paleobotanist colleague Ellie Satler (Laura Dern), and mathematician Ian Malcolm (a fast- talking, vintage Jeff Goldblum), a chaos theorist who recognizes that knowledge without discipline equals disaster. Of course he's right, and the park's maiden tour turns into a nightmare for the visitors, who include Hammond's two precocious grandchildren. Compounding this mayhem is the park's systems-control expert, who plots to sell dinosaur DNA to a rival corporation, and must sabotage park security to carry out his scheme. When a tropical storm threatens the island, our unscrupulous employee seizes the opportunity, leaving the billion-dollar attractions to roam free, as all hell breaks loose. What ensues is special-effects nirvana!Jurassic Park is an astonishing success in one sense and one sense only: It is the monster of all monster movies, guaranteed to challenge weak bladders and flutter heartbeats with its astounding full-size live-action mechanics and computer-generated imagery. But more than anything, it is Spielberg's pop culture wizardry that sells Jurassic Park. He retains a child-like glee in making us jump while giving flesh and blood characters the fright of their lives, with every mind-boggling moment of wonder and terror - from the gentle gracefulness of a gigantic Brachiosaurus walking across a green pasture to the horrifying attack of a T-Rex during a rainstorm to the first appearance of the dreaded Velociraptors. Spielberg orchestrates the action with effortless verve and, only the most Scrooge-like viewer will fail to be transfixed by the thrilling action and the sheer scale of the director's vision. T-Rex and his chums are indisputably the stars here but Jurassic Park is still a very character-driven movie, and part of what makes the film so successful is Spielberg's insistence that the dinosaurs may overrun the park, but never the film. Every character has something to do, and they are the focus of every scene with all actors pitching in commendable performances.Jurassic Park exists now as one of the pinnacles of popcorn cinema - a terrific thrill ride that is more than just the sum of its special effects. It may be easy to look at Jurassic Park as of a bygone era, but no rose-colored glasses or nostalgic impulses are needed to remain in astonishment at what Spielberg was able to create. It remains as potent an entertainment as ever - a watershed moment in cinematic history!",9,4,4,26 April 2015
The Martian," The Martian's Saturated Space Frontier is Far From Cinema's Usual Blank Spaces!
","Space is an endless stretch of deep, unfeeling, obsidian black that swallows up the curious and adventurous and spits them out without remorse. Space is exhilarating, mystifying, and ultimately terrifying - or at least that's what we've been led to believe by space disaster movies. The Martian throws all of that out the window with a wink and a mischievous grin.Set in the near future, 'The Martian' opens on Mars, where a team led by Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) is wrapping up a month-long space mission. Soon, a fierce sandstorm catches the astronauts out in the open, and they barely make it to the Martian lander that will return them to the orbiting mother ship. But one of them, botanist Mark Watney (Damon), gets hit by a rogue piece of debris. Believing him dead, Lewis has no choice but to take off without him before the storm makes liftoff impossible.But Mark isn't dead. He awakens to a beeping alarm in his helmet telling him he's almost out of air. He struggles out of the sand in which he is half buried and discovers that he has been skewered by a shard of wind-blown metal and barely makes it into the now unoccupied housing module. Meanwhile, back on earth, NASA and the rest of the world are mourning Mark's loss; at least until satellite surveillance of Mars shows signs of activity at the outpost. Faced with the incredible possibility that Mark is alive, the best minds on the planet get to work on an ambitious plan to bring him home before his supplies run out.At this point, The Martian could have become just another grim, white-knuckle-tense space disaster movies. Instead, The Martian does something unexpected. It embraces comedy - balancing knuckle-biting suspense with dollops of humor. It presents Watney as a fairly cocky, genuinely funny, easygoing everyman who just happens to be the only living thing on this entire planet. This big screen adaptation (by Drew Goddard) of Andy Weir's best-seller has just about everything: laughs, thrills, visual splendor and a rousing endorsement of the brotherhood. Ridley Scott directs with nerve and verve, delivering an almost perfect piece of popular filmmaking. Bringing optimism, nerd-itude and a touch of crazy to his character's solo ordeal, Matt Damon is the key to the movie's exuberance. Damon has never seemed more at home than he does here, millions of miles adrift, shouldering the weight of the role with diligent grace. In the face of incredible odds, he ensures Mark Watney remains an endlessly charming protagonist. The rest of the supporting cast also pitches in noteworthy performances.But the Martian's greatest asset is that it remains relentlessly, hopefully human. It takes all the romance out of Mars, but substitutes in its place science, cooperation and perseverance – a fair bargain that results in an intimate sci-fi epic that is smart, spectacular and stirring.",9,3,5,21 January 2016
The Godfather," The Godfather is An Offer No Audience Can Refuse!
","The Godfather is a textbook on cinematic lucidity - an exquisite, cohesive Mafia epic that is rightly hailed as an all-time high watermark of American cinema. Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, The Godfather constructs a sprawling family saga that tells the story of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the spider at the center of a web of deceit, murder and larceny. When the Don is left incapacitated by an attempted assassination from a rival crime family, the family quickly seeks to fill the power vacuum left by his absence and it is left up to his sons - the hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted Irish son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino) - to run the Corleone clan. Hardened by the reprisals taken against his family, the 'white-sheep' son Michael Corleone is drawn irresistibly into the gang warfare, which hints at the beginning of his moral descent. Thus underlines the tragedy of The Godfather, with the sins of the father bestowed upon his children, who if not met by death's hand will be plunged into hellfire for their actions. But, underneath all the slayings and sinister 'offers you can't refuse' this is an immigrant family drama about assimilation, blood loyalty and honor.The Godfather has a richly operatic feel to it, thanks to the solemn and stately classicism that Francis Ford Coppola brings to his pulpy material. He doesn't waste a single frame of celluloid in telling the story of the Corleone family. Every scene illuminates the motivations behind each character and dilemma within the family and all the people that surround it. The artistry of Coppola combined with Gordon Willis' spot-on cinematography and Nino Rota's haunting score covers many scenes in a deep veil of shadow, ensconcing the audience in an atmosphere of unconditional involvement.Each performance is a vignette that fits exquisitely into the whole picture. The character of Vito exhibits the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a staggering mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Brando's restrained motions and rasping speech patterns are stunningly suggestive of power while his actions (courtesy of the script) wield it. His resident power, his sheer innate force, has rarely seemed weaker. As Vito's hesitant son, Pacino rises to the occasion admirably. He beautifully underplays Michael's evolution from returning war hero to the new head of the Corleone family. Caan, gives a splendid portrayal as the hot-headed Sonny while Robert Duvall is steadily efficient as Tom Hagen. Diane Keaton is just right as Michael's oblivious love Kay.The Godfather will continue to hold a central place in cinema history, an epic which has colored everything made subsequently with its imagery and operatic scope. An enduring masterpiece!",9,1,2,31 March 2015
