The New World," A 'must see' for anyone who appreciates filmmaker Terrence Malick's work - a cinematic feast and celebration of humanity through the legend of Pocahontas
","'The New World' is an epic tale, of a young girl's wide-eyed experience of first love, of a family tribe's struggles vs. explorers' conquering fares, of a woman growing up through learning to cope with difficulties/loss, helpless violence/war, loneliness/solitude, tenaciously keeping kindness in her heart in spite of it all. Malick's vision is essentially realized by an extraordinary debut performance from Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas. It's an indisputably 'Tour De Force' Kilcher, carrying the whole film from beginning to end (135 minutes of it), beyond Colin Farrell's role of Captain John Smith, to acting along side with the ever subtle strength of ('Batman Begins') Christian Bale as Englishman John Rolfe, who became Pocahontas' dear husband and father to her child.The film is not a family movie even though 'Pocahontas' sounded Disney. This is about the historical legend of Pocahontas, how the Princess of the New World came to be. Malick uses his unique style: there are quiet deliveries of thoughts spoken (though at times, we the audience can't hear too clearly as the words were so 'silently' uttered) - we are observers to the characters, events, scenes presented on screen - poetic in its own way. Mind you there is substance, the story told is full of details and information for the taking (even though narrative seems minimal). It is a rewarding 'filmic' experience not to be rushed but gently absorbed. In spite of the harsh scenes and seeming violence, it is very much a story about humanity, of one amazing woman's contribution to mankind.Having passed through Cape Horn and scenes of Ushuaia, I especially appreciate the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki of the natural beauty of the sky, land and waters - the light and hues do seem 'out of this world'. James Horner provided the complementary score. There are approaches reminiscent of Malick's previous film, 'Days of Heaven' 1978, with Richard Gere, Brook Adams and Sam Shepard. Cinematographers Nestor Almendros and Haskell Wexler delivered remarkable natural light scenes with Ennio Morricone's integral score to perfection.",8,3,7,26 March 2006
Miracle," You don't have to know or like ice hockey to appreciate 'Miracle' - you'll relish the experience anyhow
","I'm not a sports fan per se. 'Miracle' is my first ice hockey experience and the film certainly made me enthused about it, appreciating the sport with much respect for what the players have to go through to reach where they are. Such talent, tenacity, creativity and team spirit, along with personal sacrifices, giving their all in pursuit of a dream - 'an unknown' as Kurt Russell's Coach Herb Brooks put it - their commitment is admirable.
This is a memorable film directed by Gavin O'Connor ('Tumbleweeds' 1999). He optimizes every inch of the film:  the beginning credit roll employed a montage and deft use of typography giving us a setting of the times (almost felt like watching snippets of 'The Fog of War'). Quickly and right to the point, we see Kurt Russell's Coach Brooks telling the NHL decision makers that mindset and training tactics had to be changed in order to win against the leading Soviet hockey team. And for the next 2 hours and 10 mins, the theme is unswervingly demonstrated. The film is full of heart-tugging drama and exciting action (not explosives or chases) - it's the making of an ice hockey team transformed in front of our eyes, with suspenseful moments even though it's based on a true story, and it's definitely touching and uplifting. How can it not be - it culminates into the historical event of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team playing opposite the 'undefeatable' Soviet team.Kurt Russell, a rather underrated actor, gave us an impressive performance in w-d Ron Shelton's 'Dark Blue' 2003. Here, he's taken on the role of an intelligent, tough as nails ice hockey coach, Herb Brooks, in his story of choosing 26 young men for austere training and leading 20 of them representing the privileged (dream) team into 'battles' against the world's talented hockey teams in the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, New York.
The pace is tight, even at the closing credits roll, director O'Connor seized the chance to give us follow up info on how the team athletes are now doing. But there are wonderful pausing moments between Kurt Russell and the ever talented Patricia Clarkson ('Pieces of April' 2003, 'High Art' 1998) in a 'regular' role as Brooks' wife Patti - brief the scenes may be, she very much hold her own. (Don't miss her fascinating performance with Peter Dinklage and Bobby Cannavale as the interesting threesome in w-d Tom McCarthy's excellent debut film 'The Station Agent.') Noah Emmerich delivered a quiet performance as Craig Patrick, the assistant coach. (He was in the melodrama 'Beyond Borders' 2003, along side Clive Owen and Angelina Jolie). Music by Mark Isham ('The Cooler' 2003, IMAX film 'Galapagos: The Enchanted Voyage' 1999, 'Point Break' 1991) complemented the emotional build ups.This film reminds me of another worthy team building film based on true events, also distributed by Disney: director Boaz Yakin's 'Remember the Titans' 2000, with Denzel Washington portraying Coach Boone leading a diverse high school team in unsettling times of the early 70's. Another stellar young energized cast with an equally brilliant performance from Will Patton as Coach Yoast. Experience it if you haven't.",8,0,0,8 February 2004
Mission: Impossible III," Intrigued by the supporting cast of Seymour Hoffman, Fishburne, Crudup, Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q - not a bad turnout including locations of Rome and China
","Yes, Mission: Impossible III may seem like repeat of previous plots, gadgets and effects, nevertheless, it is entertaining as any successful Hollywood action movie. It is quite a decent production that gives you your money's worth, including location filming abroad in Rome, Italy, and Shanghai, China. The ensemble supporting cast attracted me to see it on 'The Da Vinci Code' opening Friday. There's Philip Seymour Hoffman (from 'Capote' to big screen villain), Laurence Fishburne (current success with 'Akeelah and the Bee'), Billy Crudup (not being seen lately), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (another clean-cut looking role fresh from 'Match Point') and Maggie Q (from her Hong Kong fame), and Ving Rhames encore and maestro Lalo Schifrin's staple MI theme. I was satisfied with (TV series 'Lost and 'Alias' fame) writer-director J.J. Abrams' first commercial feature fare with superstar Tom Cruise leading both in acting and producing. The score from Michael Giacchino ('The Family Stone') provided the right tempo to the plot stages.The repeat of elements from previous installments rather enhanced the enjoyment of the segments presented here in M:I-3. Maggie Q likened to Kristin Scott Thomas' role in M:I-1, with collaborating operations behind the scenes nearby directing her moves; the donning of facial mask (M:I-2) gave it more fun and tension here with mirror double effect. The Rome street scene between Rhys Meyers and Cruise feigning in Italian arguing amidst traffic somehow brought smiles of brief flashes of Dan Brown's 'Angels and Demons' and touches of the mini-Coopers in 'The Italian Job.' The 'fulcrum pendulum' scene sort of reminds me of Brosnan's last 007 outing. The premise of Ethan Hunt trying not to let his fianc√©e know of his true identity/profession almost brings to mind how Schwarzenegger did very well with Jamie Lee Curtis in James Cameron's fun and adventurous 'True Lies' circa 1994. In summary, M:I-3 fits the bill of an exciting action flick without high expectations of anything more than that.",8,0,0,29 May 2006
Catch Me If You Can," Spielberg did it again! What an entertaining film for all to enjoy!
","There's so many film releases all at once that it's easy to (dis)miss Steven Spielberg's 'Catch Me If You Can.' It is a breeze of a film - thoroughly enjoyable. Such entertaining drama with humor, suspense, family ties, FBI stories, based on true events from the life and times of Frank Abagnale, Jr. Hollywood or not, it doesn't matter. C'est si bon.    Spielberg made it seem so easily done - right after the June release of 'Minority Report'. Just the opening credit sequence sets the tone of the film. Its animation is so cool that you'd know it's going to be fun. The ever prolific Maestro John Williams, a regular in Spielberg films, once again provided the accompanying tempo to the plot lines. Watching Leonardo DiCaprio (as Frank Abagnale Jr.) and Tom Hanks (as FBI agent Carl Hanratty) interact is such a treat. The vintage Christopher Walken (after such a wonderful low key performance in 'The Opportunists' 2000, again) gave an endearingly subtle portrayal as Frank Abagnale Sr. - how can Frank Jr. not do everything he can to regain the financial status to his Dad, and win Mom back? There lies the loving ties of father and son, but is it reciprocal or blind-sighted?  Besides being an 'innocent' con artist, Frank is quite skilful with graphic arts. Seeing him burnishing those PAN AM logos tack down reminds me of my graphic design days before Mac's and PCs - intently applying careful peeling, cut and paste techniques, burnishing those Pantone transfer types... The set  production and art department really brought the 60's back to life. Cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and film editing by Michael Kahn - both are veterans in Spielberg films.Behind all the cheeriness, there are bleak reality moments. After all, this is still life on earth. Lucky for Frank Jr., through all the cat and mouse hiding and chasing, agent Hanratty became almost like a surrogate father to him. Glad to see Nathalie Baye was chosen to play Frank's mother. She is one of my favorite French character actresses, since her role in Bertrand Tavernier's 'A Week's Vacation' 1980, to her 1999 'Venus Beaute Institut' and 'An Affair of Love' - always she delivers with such simple ease.
This film does remind me of 'Chameleon Street' 1989 - Wendell B. Harris Jr. wrote the screenplay based on true events, directed and portrayed con man William Douglas Street (who took on a myriad number of roles than just 3). There's also Tony Curtis in 'The Great Impostor' 1960, directed by Robert Mulligan.Thanks to the genius of Spielberg for letting us enjoy a psychological suspense drama in a lively and fun mode. Everyone involved in the production probably had a marvelous time collaborating. The audience certainly did.",8,0,1,21 January 2003
Deja Vu," Suspenseful thriller, fascinating drama and sci-fi action all integrated into one ambitiously entertaining 'D√©j√† Vu'
","It's heartwarming to know that the film was shot on location in New Orleans post-Katrina. 'D√©j√† Vu' directed by Tony Scott with Denzel Washington in the lead role is 100% entertaining - top notch delivery all round vs. the disappointing/misleading 'Happy Feet' rates only 50% - dazzling animation with musical numbers but poor story (in spite of #1 box office three weeks in a row). A hint to enjoy viewing 'D√©j√† Vu' is to 'shadow' Denzel Washington's character Doug, ATF agent - just stay close to him and you won't be lost. Be fascinated by the space-time travel aspects at the 'time window lab' presented to you/Doug. Suspend your disbelief and you'll follow the plot with excitement and anticipation. A sci-fi fan or not, you'll be caught up with the pace that Doug is traveling, or his mind which is constantly thinking/rethinking, dissecting/searching for evidence, next steps - it's a ride you want to hold on to till the very end. It is human drama after all and you will be content. There are sprinkling of clues here and there if you should recall (but not essential) - loose strings will be gathered and you'll somehow get to understand/put together. Dashes of subtle humor we're given, too (for instance, 'we once held hands' so Doug casually said) - it'd bring a smile and quickly we're transported to the next point. Hang in there with Denzel/Doug and a great time you'd spend guaranteed.Distributed by Touchstone Pictures, this is a Jerry Bruckheimer with Scott Free productions. Third time collaboration for director Tony Scott and star Denzel Washington (previously 'Crimson Tide' 1995, 'Man On Fire' 2004). Tight script co-written by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio (who's also co-executive producer), with matching, enhancing score by Harry Gregson-Williams. Of course, the visual/special effects, explosives and chase scenes are challengingly striking, especially the 'time warp' vehicular sequences. (Washington's role and his air reminds me of his acting in d- Gregory Hoblit's 'Fallen' 1998.) Jim Caviezel gave us a devilish heartless villain (yes, quite a departure from the sacred role in d- Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ' 2004). I appreciate the two woman roles: Paula Patton as Claire playing opposite Washington and Caviezel with comparable energy and spunk; Erika Alexander as Shanti sitting there equally with her other colleagues (Val Kilmer, Adam Goldberg, Elden Hensen) at the time window lab - cool, how she describes the branching theory.Should you be interested in absorbing more about the 'fabric of space-time folding,' 'wormhole,' 'string theory,' visit the official site 'dejavu.movies.go.com' - click on 'About' tab and you can download the full production notes PDF file. (On page 8, physicist-consultant Dr. Greene explained in simplified terms about time travel, parallel universes, including the bit about seeing yourself in the mirror, that 'you are actually looking at yourself as you existed 16 nanoseconds ago' ).We may have time travel, time warp movies before: d- Robert Zemekis' ever popular 'Back to the Future' 1985, d- Peter Hyam's cop thriller 'Timecop' 1994 (with Jean-Claude Van Demme), but 'D√©j√† Vu' is special in that the production made the city of New Orleans, its people and landscapes very much 'a character in the film.' At the end credits, it's thoughtfully included that the film is dedicated to the strength and enduring spirit of the people of New Orleans.",8,1,3,3 December 2006
Memento," It's literally OTNEMEM - check out its official Web site to further your Memento experience
","I usually send in my comments first before I read the other IMDb User Comments. For Memento, pardon the pun, I reversed my practice: I literally read the 100+ comments prior to sending this one in. I have had the same immediate let down feeling towards the way the film ended. Yet I agree with some that it's probably writer-director Christopher Nolan's insight to end it so. I'm glad to know from several user comments that the short-term memory loss situations Lenny and Sammy displayed were clinically authentic. Overall, Memento is this year's filmic experience not to be missed - perhaps NFE (not for everyone), but if you love movies, especially a mind twister, this one is certainly for you.The progression of the film in reverse order did remind me of director David Jones's Harold Pinter's 'Betrayal' 1983, also begins at the end (of a 7-year affair) and working its way back to the beginning of the affair as the film ends. The editing fete also reminded me of director Stanley Donen's 'Two for the Road' 1967, which is a must for movie lovers: it's a journey, going back and forth with the two charming leads, Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn as Mark and Joanna in their mid-life marital crises, where sequence of events is presented in fast forward and rewind modes - a unique film experience.German writer-director Tom Tykwer's 'Winter Sleepers' 1997, has a character similar to Lenny, who has a short-term memory, uses a camera to snap and record things that he saw, then develops the film to look at the captured events on photos. The film deals with pairs of characters, multiple storylines that cross each other, as feelings and reactions are fatefully presented - a theme animatedly reinforced in his subsequent 'Run Lola Run' 1998, which used the approach of repeating the same story thrice but offering different aspects every time. It was successful in having heart and humanity. In Memento, the fact that Lenny has a short-term memory capacity, feelings are hence devoid. The Sammy Jankis episodes did provoke touches of humanity.Guy Pearce has outdone himself as Lenny here in 'Memento'. It's beyond his already sensitive performance as Captain Boyd, playing opposite Robert Carlyle in director Antonia Bird's 'Ravenous' 1999, which is another film NFE, no ordinary soldier's tale of 1847 indeed.If you want to see Joe Pantoliano in a more substantial role than being Teddy here, try the Wachowski ('The Matrix') brothers' 'Bound' 1996, playing opposite Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon, as the top sleaze (well, not until Pierce Brosnan in John Boorman's John le Carre's 'The Tailor of Panama' 2001, took top 'honors' as the ultimate sleazy, swindling, deliciously amoral spy Osnard).For Carrie-Anne Moss, as a demure woman, not a word of filth (if you can't stand the 5-mins. worth of swearing coming out of her mouth as Natalie here), try director Lasse Hallstrom's 'Chocolat'. She delivered a just as strong performance as the other woman characters (Juliette Binoche, Lena Olin, Judi Dench) in this fairytale of a story, which also has its moral center (or dilemma) lodged in the character she played opposite veteran actor Alfred Molina.Last year we have Mike Figgis' 'Time Code', this year we have Christopher Nolan's 'OTNEMEM'.",7,0,0,12 April 2001
The Notebook," Reminiscence of romantic young loves - a thorough dramatic tear-jerker for the hopelessly, or hopefully, romantic
","So it's quite melodramatic and probably familiar heart-tugging, sentimental plots - but you expect no less from a tear-jerker romance. The trailer of 'The Notebook' sure beckons the romantics, young and old (since we see Gena Rowlands and James Garner included). It's worth it just watching the intense chemistry firing up, hot and cool, between the two central leads, Ryan Gosling as Noah and Rachel McAdams as Allie - it's a godsend pairing of these two young actors in their blossoming twenties, both from Ontario, Canada. Gosling is a stunner in his brave portrayal of Danny in 'The Believer' 2001 (controversial subjects in a substantial film, indeed, from w-d Henry Bean). McAdams delivered a wickedly fun Regina George opposite Lindsay Lohan in director Mark S. Waters' 'Mean Girls' 2004, screenplay by Tina Fey of SNL fame.There's subtle but steady supporting roles from Joan Allen playing the stern opposing mom (with a secret) to Allie, and Sam Shepard as the supportive enduring dad to Noah. The skilful cinematography by Robert Fraisse (responsible for director Jean-Jacques Annaud's 'The Lover' aka L'Amant 1992) complemented director Nick Cassavetes and the production design efforts. Yes, that swan swarm scene is a true love sight incarnate, seven years or not. Chance and coincidences, in love and war, together or apart, are part and parcel to the plot. I enjoyed the chance of naturally washing my eyes through and through. It's a winning love story, soap or not.Two other movies also based on Nicholas Sparks' novels: 'A Walk to Remember' 2002 directed by Adam Shankman, another tear-jerker about romantic young loves with an endearing performance from Mandy Moore as Jamie, Peter Coyote as dad Reverend Sullivan, and Shane West as Landon, who pursued Jamie and became a changed young man for the better. 'Message In A Bottle' 1999 directed by Luis Mandoki, with Kevin Costner and Robin Wright Penn, and Paul Newman as Costner's dad - another lovelorn (tear-jerker) romance, this time more for grown-ups. For a heart-warming and delightful romance with touches of Italian flavor, bread or pie, mother and daughter, an ideal son-in-law, I recommend w-d Melissa Martin's 'The Bread, My Sweet' 2001, aka Wedding for Bella (DVD title). Scott Baio is Dominic the brainy businessman-brother-baker next door, Kristin Minter is Lucca the long 'lost & found' daughter, and Rosemary Prinz is Bella the life-loving wife & mother in a charming, moving little film.",7,0,2,14 September 2004
Troy," An entertaining blockbuster movie of Greek mythology, with stars including Peter O'Toole and a glimpse of Julie Christie
","Directed and co-produced by Wolfgang Petersen (German filmmaker of the famous 'Das Boot' 1981 and his last seen picture in 2000 'The Perfect Storm') TROY is an entertaining big-budget Hollywood fare. The first Saturday matinee show of the opening weekend was quite crowded. Audience attention were held. The film was well-paced even though it's 2 hrs. 42 mins. - it didn't feel long. The story was well-scripted for the screen - condensing and adapting from Homer's 'The Iliad' to big screen entertainment is no small fete - kudo's to writer David Benioff who did 'The 25th Hour' 2002. The battle scenes - yes, the immensity and impact felt with the wide angle coverage - CGI, special effects, visual effects notwithstanding - cinematographer Roger Pratt (who's done quite a few projects with filmmaker Terry Gilliam) delivered effectively, along with score by James Horner at a slightly different tempo here (quite a bit of sweltering notes and trumpets for the period) 'twas good to employ Greek songs aptly mournful in tone to match story progression - there were four funeral rituals respectfully depicted on screen. There's plenty of online information to be found on Homer, Trojan War, Achilles and as much Greek Mythology as you can take. It seems there's quite a backstory on Achilles' mother Thetis, portrayed briefly by Julie Christie, who has prophetic power, indeed (even Zeus feared her). The scene with Peter O'Toole as King Priam meeting Brad Pitt's Achilles was a memorable one by the lines spoken. A tender scene is when Hector (a steady performance from Eric 'HULK' Bana), on the night before fighting Achilles, telling his wife Andromache (played by lovely Saffron Burrows) how to save her and their son from the invading Achaean Greeks. The voices of Brian Cox (as King Agamemnon) and Brendan Gleeson (as Menelaus, husband of Helen) were unmistakable even under the heavy garb and beards. 'Lord of the Rings' fans would be happy to see Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean in action here. The movie could have been called 'Achilles' as the story is centered around Brad Pitt's role, but 'TROY' does sound more assuring as a movie title.Saw the cable History Channel's 'True Story of Troy' and remembered I've seen the site of Troy when I was in Turkey (1996). It is considered one of the tourist spots for European tours of Turkey by Canakkale and you get to see the legendary Trojan Wooden Horse. Hearing about the excavation history and the archaeologists, literary detectives and military analysts talk about the Trojan War and Homer's poems - yes, like any documentary, these may be mere sound bites and edited images that could be taken out of context, nevertheless, it was interesting to view the TV episode. Perhaps more insightful a documentary on war and the facts and thinking behind war strategy is the honestly worthy Oscar winner, Errol (The Thin Blue Line) Morris' 'The Fog of War,' where former Secretary of Defense Robert S.(Strange) McNamara is featured talking, reflecting, contemplating about the effects of war. Another fascinating talking head documentary is by filmmakers Andr√© Heller and Othmar Schmiderer, 'Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary,' featuring Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, who described her experiences during the last days with Hitler. It's been a while since we get to see an epic Greek myth on screen, and 'TROY' is as good a chance as any.",7,0,1,21 May 2004
Chicken Run," If you like 'Babe', 'Chicken Run' would be delectably enjoyable
","'Tis really chicken-fun and tastily delightful. More than two years in the making, the attention to detail is remarkable -- down to each eyeball and eyelid! Apart from the lighting and photography, costumes and modelmaking, music and sound were very much contributing factors to the success of this 'chickens pursuing their freedom dream' movie. Storyline feels real and the dialogs are tight and definitely full of British humour, puns and jokes. It's indeed entertaining. You can tell director/claymation team Peter Lord and Nick Park must have a terrific time creating and producing this feature length chick flick -- such passionate fun! This DreamWorks project, executive produced by Jeffrey Katzenberg, may be an animation feature, yet it contains thrills and suspense comparable to Hollywood action drama and easily surpasses them. It's more fun than 'Antz'. It's down to earth chicken sense will find you cheering for the whole lot as they gave their all in fulfilling the freedom dream. Don't hesitate to see this 'cos it's animation -- it's actually more entertaining and satisfying than Disney's 'The Kid' 2000 (which turned out to be your usual Disney family fare, slightly slow and good for kids; 'tis really Bruce Willis character times three generations with the kid version portrayed by the lively Spencer Breslin). Drama, action and entertainment-wise, 'Chicken Run' is the movie for you.",7,0,0,9 July 2000
Children of Heaven," Wholesome 100% natural cinematic staple -- well-leavened and savory!
","This translates to MUST-SEE! It's a credulous incredible storytelling of a young brother and sister in Tehran, and the adventurous saga around one very important pair of sneakers.The two young actors are amazing -- they play their guileless na√Øve sensitivity with such earnestness! Central character, Ali, the 9 year old brother, is Mir Farrokh Hashemian, who really carried the film with his legwork, and the younger sister Zahra is Bahareh Seddiqui, who contributed her restrained share of screen presence. The pair is so natural: those furrowed faces, anxious knitted brows -- the range of sad faces the two came up with! The bond between the brother and sister is so warm and joyful - in spite of misfortunes.The storyline is seemingly simple. Such story-weaving knack writer-director Majid Majidi has -- he can make chasing along a streaming gutter into an intense dramatic episode! The story has the texture likened to a Thomas Hardy novel (poverty setting, episode after episode, turn of events), yet such a relishingly simple delivery. He doesn't have to tell it all on the screen -- little nuances and observations suffice.It's heartening to see young children who are polite and respectful to their elders, responsible and caring in dealing with their everyday problems, and not give up -- such quiet fortitude in spite of disappointments, such tolerance of their circumstance yet still able to find joy in little things. We catch a smile here and there, e.g., when they enjoy the impromptu soap bubbles, or when he encouraged his sister by giving her small tokens.This is an absolute gem of a family (value) film. Children's emotions untapped, yet adults are not left out -- touches of  grown-up connections: the parents, the elderly couple next door, the shop-owners, all made this world very real.The camerawork, and the well-designed use of sound mixed with accompanying music (different tonal quality instruments were applied) complemented this cinematic experience. A poetic ending -- there's a serenity about it all.I hope 'Children of Heaven' will win this year's 71st Academy Award Best Foreign Film Oscar -- it will receive its due exposure and more people will experience this gem.Along the lines of poverty and shoes, I thought of  the Italian 1978's 'The Tree of the Wooden Clogs' by writer-director Ermanno Olmi. And, on a story with substance and good acting by an Iranian young boy, there's 1989's 'Bashu, The Little Stranger', by writer-director Bahram Beizai. Both are movies to be appreciated.",10,69,78,16 February 1999
Snatch," Beyond the 'Snatch' of a diamond - 'I Went Down' is a gem of a sleeper
","Writer-director Guy Ritchie's 'Snatch' is full of British humor and jabs at the underworld of thieves, swindlers, and the not-so-smart crooks. Its visual presentation maximized graphic design communication styles like typographic key words and symbolic icons as connections or suggestive rebus. The whole movie is kind of like flipping through a comic strip, albeit it's breezy and fun, enjoyable if you like that sort of thing. It's an ensemble cast with catchy names: Benicio Del Toro is Franky Four Fingers, Brad Pitt is One Punch Mickey, Rade Serbedzija is Boris The Blade, and Dennis Farina is Cousin Avi. Watch out for the little dog - you might say Ritchie's attention to details includes direction of this star of a dog.Another film that comes to mind on 'quirky' small time gangster tales is the Irish flavor 'I Went Down' 1997. It has more substance and depth of plotline and characters; another darn good performance from Brendan Gleeson (who was superb as Martin Cahill in writer-director John Boorman's 'The General' 1998, based on true life story.) Peter McDonald of 'The Opportunists' 2000 was the reluctant prot√©g√© alongside Gleeson in this small gem of a sleeper. 'I Went Down' has its equal fun logic, yet it's a crime story with a difference beyond Hollywood hang-ups. A tip: do not try to see 'I Went Down' in a hurry, it's kinda like a steady road trip, as the two leads get to understand each other better, and perhaps reveal the purpose/philosophy of it all. After all, there's more than meets the eye (or ear, rather) the banters we hear between Gleeson and McDonald - it's a well-written script by Conor McPherson, and directed by Paddy Breathnach with Irish finesse.",6,0,1,25 February 2001
Lost in Translation," The combination is irresistible - Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in a Sofia Coppola film taking place in Tokyo
","Yes, why do I like this seemingly 'nothing much happening' film? But there is a lot going on - the nuanced performance from Bill Murray in a sustaining restrained lead role not quite seen before. Psychologically, underneath - much is happening. On the surface it's like two lonely people, inadvertently met, wiling their time away. Bide for a while, and then a while. Time standing still for a while for these two souls on earth - nothing specific. Just be. Being there. The subtlety of it all. It's natural - there's an uneasiness at ease.If you ask me why I like 'Paycheck,' I can quickly quip: I like Philip K. Dick's sci-fi short stories, and Uma Thurman and Ben Affleck is a new combination in an action movie directed by John Woo. It's not like at a social occasion giving a passing remark: Oh, I like it because. With 'Lost in Translation,' can't respond in just a phrase or mere sentence.
It actually felt quite like a European film. The fact that there's no evident plotline or obvious story made it fall into non-mainstream category. However, hooray! it got recognized by fellow filmmakers/film professionals at the 2004 Academy Award nominations for the best motion picture of the year, best achievement in directing, and best writing, screenplay written directly for the screen - Sofia Coppola sure did, and YES, definitely, the best actor in a leading role by Bill Murray! Four nods are quite an accomplishment.Bill Murray's acceptance speech at the 2004 Golden Globes, right after Diane Keaton's zesty delivery for best actress nod in 'Something's Gotta Give', was the second distinguishable highlight of the awards evening. His deadpan face, subtle words that were obviously biting and darn humorous, is simply delightful!What I like about 'Lost in Translation' is in its delivery. Sofia Coppola has such a graphic visual eye. Just the beginning frame is impressive. (Reminds me of Woody Allen's Sweetland Films logo). How the opening credits appear along the shapely curve, quietly on the surface, yet the image on screen is intriguing already. It's refreshing. It's inviting. 'wanted to know more. The film is almost like a well-composed musical piece with its prelude, adagio, poi a poi, andante, dolcezza - it's free fugue for a duet, Murray and Johansson, floating between the Hyatt milieu and Tokyo by night. We get to know the two principals, slowly, by degrees, tempo picks up, flowing, pause, sweetness, softness felt - in spite of the age difference - there's no barrier to the mutual affinity. It's Sofia Coppola's poetry in motion.Johansson's portrayal of Charlotte is so unnoticeably perfect that it matches Murray's Bob Harris with just the right strength of subtlety. Cinematographer Lance Acord (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich) gave us the Tokyo that Sofia Coppola has in mind to share: graphic patterns, like the reflections in a passing car window, dazzling neons seen from different perspectives, the sidewalk parting at a crowded promenade where they disappearingly linger. The soundtrack of selected songs and music, and the sound designs certainly made the viewing experience whole.'Lost In Translation' is yet another outstanding addition to the many films distributed by Focus Features: Far From Heaven, The Pianist, Talk to Her, 21 Grams.Another attempt at synopsis: two lonely souls, coincidentally met, drank together, casually chat with each other, and non-eventful events happen - impacting each other's life. It's NFE (not for everyone) but it's worth spending time with Murray and Johansson in Sofia Coppola's translated world.",8,0,1,3 February 2004
Lost in Translation," An irresistible combination: Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in a Sofia Coppola film set in Tokyo
","Sofia Coppola's film 'Lost in Translation' does seem like nothing much is happening. But beneath the nuanced, seemingly restrained, performance from Bill Murray as Bob Harris (very much his own movie star persona), much is happening. Scarlett Johansson's portrayal of Charlotte imperceptibly matches Murray with the right measure of sophistication. On the surface, it's like two lonely people, inadvertently met, casually chatting with each other, whiling away their time, and non-eventful events happen, subtly impacting each other's life. It all seem so naturally happening in the city of Tokyo, in and around the enclosed space of a high-rise luxurious hotel, 'home away from home' - there's an uneasiness at ease. It feels like a European film. There's no evident plotline or obvious story, yet I like 'Lost in Translation' because of its delivery. Sofia Coppola has such a graphic visual eye. Just the beginning frame is impressive - the opening credits quietly appearing along a shapely curve - the on-screen image is alluring, inviting and prompts one wanting to know more. It's like a free fugue, the characters of Murray and Johansson floating between the hotel milieu and Tokyo by night. Gradually, we learn more about the two principals, and there's no barrier to the mutual affinity, age difference or not. It's Sofia Coppola's poetry in motion enhanced by the selective songs/music and (ambient) sound design, along with interspersed appearance by Giovanni Ribisi as Charlotte's husband John and a complementary Japanese cast making the viewing experience engagingly whole.  Cinematographer Lance Acord (Adaptation; Being John Malkovich) gave us the Tokyo that Sofia Coppola has in mind: people movements, graphic patterns - from the reflections in a passing car window, the dazzling neon from varying perspectives, the contrasting colors/moods of the locals vs. the foreigners, to the sidewalk parting at a crowded promenade where one 'disappearingly' lingers. 'Lost In Translation' is an outstanding addition to Focus Features that gave us 'Far From Heaven,' 'The Pianist,' 'Talk to Her' and  '21 Grams.' It may not be for everyone, yet it's worth spending time with Murray and Johansson in Sofia Coppola's translated world if you appreciate the language of films.For more substantial story structure, try 'Miracle' (the uplifting film about the 1980 US Olympic Hockey Team led by legendary coach Herb Brooks, convincingly portrayed by Kurt Russell), or 'Japanese Story' (the intriguing Australian film with a distinctive lead performance by Toni Collette.)RESEND 2/8/04 ruby_fff",8,0,1,8 February 2004
Bridget Jones's Diary," The history of love between Miss Jones and Mr. Darcy - almost a modern-day Austen tale
","It's talented Miss Z (Renee Zellweger) meets Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), with Hugh Grant the Imp-erfect boss, Gemma Jones the glamorous Mom, Jim Broadbent the tolerant Dad, and Embeth Davidtz as Natasha, shadowing Mark Darcy. If you've seen the A&E 1995 miniseries 'Pride and Prejudice' with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, you might think that they intentionally have Firth as Mark Darcy in 'Bridget Jones's Diary.' The two Darcy's truly belong to Colin Firth, who delivered both characters with equal brilliance and restraint. The latter, being outside of Austen's landscape, provided more room for Firth's subtle comedic touch.I thoroughly enjoyed the preview of director Sharon Maguire's 2001 'Bridget Jones's Diary.' Zellweger put on 15-20 pounds and a British accent for the lead role. Once again, she optimized the chance to deliver the role with spot-on comedic tempo - one cannot not laugh and chuckle over the endearingly clumsy, not so articulate or business smart Miss Jones in her 30's, looking for the perfect man to take her away from the life of being single.Hugh Grant certainly is taking risks these days - he was a charming swindler in Woody Allen's 'Small Time Crooks' 2000; here in 'Bridget Jones's Diary,' still exuding his infectious charm, Grant has no qualms in displaying the slapstick side of him, appearing uncouth and downright drenched and untidy (and 'bit of bloody, too.)The audience at the preview obviously enjoyed the movie. I was unable to catch certain phrases due to the laughter and hearty chuckles. We're having such a good time watching Zellweger, Grant and Firth interacting. The dialogs were funny and engaging, and the plot is not entirely predictable - we were kept in suspense prior to the ending. (Demonstrating how easily we assume and react, thinking at once in our own perspective vs. pause to project - oh well, an inescapable human condition inherent to relationships, indeed.)There was no ending credit roll at the preview, but the songs were catchy and finger tapping. I hope they will keep the beyond-ending segment of rolling the childhood video of Jones (at 4) and Darcy (at 8) - it sure adds depth to the history of love.Other worthwhile Renee Zellweger films are: director Dan Ireland's 'Whole Wide World, The' 1996, as Novalyne Price opposite Vincent D'Onofrio; director Boaz Yakin's 'Price Above Rubies, A' 1998, a substantial gutsy role as a Jewish young woman in the jewelry business opposite Christopher Eccleston; director Carl Franklin's 'One True Thing' 1998, as daughter to Meryl Streep and William Hurt; director Neil LaBute's 'Nurse Betty' 2000, as Betty Sizemore, another funny and sensitive role, opposite Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, and Greg Kinnear.",7,0,0,31 March 2001
The Italian Job," A satisfyingly entertaining re-make with a techno-approach, with equal suspenseful fun and humor of a heist with mini-coopers and traffic jam in L.A.
","'The Italian Job' 1969 I fondly remember - those three red, white and blue mini FIATs scooting around dodging the Italian police - high and low, whizzing up onto the top of a dome or splashing down by the waters, a 15 minutes worth of quite a caper of chase through Turin. It was a British-Italian production from Paramount, then 'A Gulf + Western Company,' directed by Peter Collinson with Michael Caine as Charlie Crocker, and No√´l Coward as Mr. Bridger, a figure in prison well-respected - there lies the British humor to the plot. The opening and ending frames were also memorable: Rossano Brazzi driving a cool red sports car while Matt Monroe singing 'On Days Like These' (music by Quincy Jones, lyrics by Don Black), and pardon the pun, a cliff-hanger of a bus with the essential glistening load and Caine uttering, 'hang on a minute, lads, I got a great idea¬Ö' ending with a rallying chorus singing the catchy tune 'The Self-Preservation Society'...amusing, indeed.'The Italian Job' 2003, also produced by Paramount Pictures, directed by F. Gary Gray ('Set It Off' 1996, 'The Negotiator' 1998) with refreshed screenplay by Donna and Wayne Powers of Troy Kennedy-Martin's original script, successfully delivered matching fun and humor with a smaller concentrated team of six - well, it's Mark Wahlberg as Charlie with three essential partners: Seth Green the computer whiz 'Napster' Lyle, Jason Statham (of 'Transporter' 2002) as Handsome Rob the car expert, Mos Def as Left Ear the explosive expert (that 'don't do dogs' as the trailer suggested). Also there's Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron, as father and daughter John and Stella Bridger - both expert safe crackers, and from the trailer, we know already, Ed Norton as Steve the betraying nemesis. We actually get double scoops of action thrills of two heist setups in this version. An exciting start and the pacing throughout keeps audience going, rooting for Charlie and co. Here we also have three mini-coopers in blue, red and white. They also gave f√™tes of acrobatic agility: speeding down subway steps, flying high jumps, swirling through splashing cylindrical tunnel, down to the 'open the door' routine that finishes off a pursuant on bike. The Powers' script had fun with the key players, giving each specific characteristics that provided chuckling amusement. The plot may be nothing new to a heist story, but it's tight and just as suspenseful with its modern day techno approaches. The father and daughter drama gave Theron a more substantial woman's role than Angelina Jolie's in 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' (2000). All in all, this is an entertaining Hollywood caper with satisfying ending guaranteed.",7,1,2,1 June 2003
Little Miss Sunshine," Enjoyable and endearing, full of life's natural contradictions that strengthen a family bond
","This is a gem, without a doubt. One would hardly think a story about a dysfunctional family on a road trip in a rather shabby VW bus can be 'heart-warmingly' touching, down to earth satisfying and hilariously endearing. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is perceptively scripted by Michael Arndt, full of everyday flawed characters. What an ensemble cast: gifted Greg Kinnear as Dad the winning failure, ever-capable Toni Collette as Mom the pillar collected, underrated Steve Carell as uncle Frank the improbable mentor, with veteran Alan Arkin as grandpa the unpredictable, talented Paul Dano as teen brother in angst, and the star focus of little Abigail Breslin as Olive - a ball of energy determined (destined) to enter the Little Miss Sunshine 'beauty pageant.' Featured debut partnered direction from husband & wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is a successful and worthwhile endeavor. Certainly helps to have strong producers that have faith in a rather non-Hollywood, unpopular and bold subject. A sleeper, all in all. Some of the language/ideas in passing may not be for everyone, but it's all uttered/delivered rather naturally.The music soundtrack enhances most appropriately. The choices made by directors Dayton & Faris (who are well-versed in music video productions) made the film the more engaging, with score by Mychael Danna, 'backing' the music/songs by the band DeVotchka. The dynamics radiate and we, the audience, catch on to the evolving situations and take things as they come just like the Hoovers on screen. I pride myself for being able to guess at the moves/next steps they'd take: at the hospital with grandpa, how Olive interacts with brother Dwayne by the roadside, or on stage with Olive, so I applaud.It was wonderful reading the production notes about how the film came to be - a dedicated force gathered: from writer, to producers to selecting director(s) to casting and production team of photography, set design, costume, editing, and music.If you're willing to take a chance to go on this road trip with the Hoover Family ensemble of characters not unlike life's little encounters and happenstance, you will be satisfied and have an enjoyable time - hilarious and heartening at best.",8,1,4,22 August 2006
"I, Robot"," A dramatic look into the world of robotics and a possible glimpse of futuristic society
","After seeing the depiction of robots in action in 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,' I felt I needed to see 'I, Robot' in order to be fair (hm, to science, robotics, fantasies). I really like this Alex Proyas (of 'Dark City' 1997) endeavour of 'I, Robot' and Will Smith is perfect in the role of detective Spooner, who has gained mutual respect from US Robotics' lead scientist Dr. Alfred Landing (James Cromwell portrays). Bridget Moynahan's underplayed Dr. Susan Calvin may come across almost robotic herself, but gradually, she's warming up to robot 'sonny' (the unique 'son' to Dr. Landing) and Spooner's repeated attempts to open her eyes to the 'truth' of things. 'Sky Captain' is strictly comic book fare, comedic and fun thanks to Gwenyth Paltrow's versatile and generous not-afraid-to-poke-fun-at-herself delivery. It's an enjoyable romp and very stylish-looking illustrative movie adventure with Jude Law as the heroic Cap and sidekick whiz from Giovanni Ribisi, plus fleeting glimpses of Angelina Jolie in spiffy uniform and a bravado eye-patch. The robots come across as rather 'woodenly tame' threats.'I, Robot' is more serious in theme and respectful in delivering Isaac Asimov's robot concepts. Yes, the film has all the makings of a techno suspense action thriller, with literally massive digital visuals of robots 'acting' en masse. Human touches were not neglected: there's Dr. Landing's sentiments, gentle caring and thoughtfulness felt even behind the fa√ßade of the hologram appearance; Sonny's budding emotions and a 'winking' friendliness; Spooner's history and reasons why he 'reacts' to fighting potential 'robot crimes'; Dr. Calvin's seemingly vulnerable side in spite of her high scientific quotient; and the minor fact that there's a flurry lovable cat included in the picture. The film is entertaining in its dramatic plot and turns, spectacular visual effects and also befitting casting. Bruce Greenwood's CEO character might keep one guessing if he's a villain or victim (he was the President in 'Thirteen Days' 2000, and a calculating murderer in 'Double Jeopardy' 1999.) The film might even raise the question if mankind and robots can live together harmoniously.A Web search on 'Asimov' rendered a lot of online resources accessible for more in-depth information, and there's an interesting collection of Asimov's personal quotes from IMDb database. I appreciate director Chris Columbus' 'Bicentennial Man' 1999, lively and well-portrayed lead character by Robin Williams, with Embeth Davidtz, and I posted comments on IMDb 2 Jan 2000.'I, Robot' is a rewarding film for sci-fi fans for sure, and for fans of Will Smith and filmmaker Alex Proyas.",8,0,1,10 October 2004
Salt," One damn good action hero Jolie is, and in SALT, it felt like a female 'Jack Bauer 24' type non-stop for the whole 100 minutes complete
","Yes, Angelina Jolie can very well be our lady James Bond, anytime. She has integrally proved in the superb Simon West directed 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider' 2001, and opposite Brad Pitt as the dynamic duo in 'Bourne Identity' director Doug Liman's 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' 2005. From the Special Collector's Edition DVD behind the scenes, we learned that Jolie did her own stunts after rigorous physical training, that her agile moves were more convincing than stunt doubles. Impressively credulous - she embodies the character of Lara Croft and she is Lara Croft, The Tomb Raider, 100 percent (and beyond). And when she is Jane Smith, she is the unmistakable fearless lethal assassin just as her husband John Smith is. Jolie's star power, acting energy, physical and inner strength always intensely come through and through. As agent Evelyn Salt, she's no match for anyone - except Jack Bauer of '24'. I totally see her as the female equivalent to Jack, from the very first moment as SALT, the movie, opens.As one famous film critic pointed out that SALT made RUN LOLA RUN (1998 w-d Tom Tykwer with Franka Potente of 'Bourne Identity' being Lola) seem like mere walking for its 80 minutes. Jolie in SALT is constantly on the run (sprinting, leaping, jumping, running down, running up, running across), and her brain never stops as unbroken string of hindrances every which way are coming at her, trying to stop her dead, literally. Fear not, and it's no spoiler, Evelyn Salt is one determined agent, Russian or otherwise, out to defend the US of A (just as '24' Jack Bauer does at all costs, risking loved ones and sacrificing oneself consciously to get to the next step and to achieve the unswerving goal - save the world, too, while s/he's at it). There's many twists and turns. Convoluted? 'Nah'. It's standard espionage fare, cold war related, action-filled screenplay by competent 'Equilibrium' (2002) w-d Kurt Wimmer. Director Phillip Noyce is no stranger to this genre, he had given us Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan in 'Clear and Present Danger' (1994). It is Jolie whom you want to follow from beginning to end, and you badly wanted her to succeed, just as agent Salt does.Accompany her, worry for her, cheer for her. Is she or is she not a Russian spy product - you would at times waver but no time to ponder. Her next move may reveal yet another level in the game plan, and you'd think how clever she is, or empathize with her for why she did what she did - she's already moved on. The story pacing is non-stop and there's no time for second-guessing who's the real bad guy and who can really help Salt. Is she truly on her own? If you want a good thriller and your money's worth for 100 minutes, Jolie's SALT is the best bet.Music by James Newton Howard, along with director of photography Robert Elswit, editing team of Stuart Baird, John Gilroy and Steven Kemper, tightly delivered the scenes with earnest proficiency. Key supporting roles by Liev Schreiber as Ted, Salt's mentor (he's in 'A Walk on the Moon' 1999 with Diane 'Unfaithful' Lane, 'Hamlet' 2000, 'Defiance' 2008 opposite James Bond Daniel Craig, among many others) and Chiwetel Ejiofor as agent Peabody (he's memorable in d- Stephen Frears' 2002 'Dirty Pretty Things' with Audrey 'Amelie' Tautou, and in last year's disaster-blockbuster of '2012').By the way, w-d Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' with stellar cast of DiCaprio, Cotillard, Page, Watanabe, Caine, Gordon-Levitt, including Cillian Murphy - is very much a mind-bending spiral tale of intrigue, psychological sci-fi if you will, while SALT is one continuous straight action-packed thriller helmed by Angelina Jolie from start to finish. Apples and oranges, not to be compared.For a down to earth, cold war period Russian (and French) spy suspense and human drama, based on true events in the annals of US-French-Russian spy history, see 'Farewell' aka 'L'affaire Farewell' (2009), a worthy French film by director Christian Carion (of 'Joyeux Noel' 2005), along the vein of 'The Lives of Others' (aka 'Das Leben der Anderen' 2006, German Oscar winner by w-d Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck) - a little known string of events yet critical to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall.",7,3,6,5 August 2010
The White Ribbon," This film prompted me to view and truly appreciate the mastery of filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer and his 'Ordet' 1955
","Austrian writer-director Michael Haneke's films are always serious & content controversial, with complex emotions, mostly joyless and lacking in warm lovingness, never sentimental. So they are definitely NFE: not for everyone. In 'The White Ribbon' 2009, delivered in stark black & white, the film is to the point of austere. Hence when a glimmer of love beckons, peering through all the somber, mind-provoking issues paraded in front of our eyes - like the rare occasional smiles between the two demurely cautious young lovers of the village schoolteacher (played by Christian Friedel) and Eva, his fianc√©e-former nanny to the baron household (played by Leonie Benesch), you'd probably try to hold onto that flickering candle light and keep it closely guarded throughout the film as the young man did, so to come out (alive) of whatever consequences the story results in. Though skillful cinematography by Christian Berger of natural landscapes, village scenes contrasting specific interior lighting of the characters and situations, contributed to the flow of the 'filmic' journey.The story is told with a narrator from the perspective of the schoolteacher recalling from his memories. It is true of Haneke's treatment here is likened to a mystery unraveling - but certainly not anything like what you might expect of the genre. He's merely providing 'facts' and pieces of information that could clue us in to what may be going on. Haneke has the polished sophistication of leaving it up to the viewers to contemplate the meaning of what we see on screen as he presents them. Yes, you might say going to a Michael Haneke film is in itself an introspective experience, potently emotional or provocatively intellectual (or both). Content is substantial, with multiple characters from adults to adolescents to children, doctor, baron, pastor, farmer, steward of a village community, and the turn of events keep coming one after another - intriguing more than entertaining. The film is in German with English subtitles, and dialog is not sparing at all (pardon the pun), mercilessly so. The runtime is 2 hours and 24 minutes.You can easily find the synopsis or plot points spelled out through reviews and discussions on the Web, including the official Sony Classics site at 'sonyclassics.com/thewhiteribbon'. Press Kit with Haneke Q&A is available as PDF download. You may relish more by seeing the film without prior extensive exposure to the story. In any case, I felt there are parallels to Dreyer's 'Ordet' (Danish for 'The Word') with just as many characters and relationships, sequence of events, community pressures, yet through anger, arguments, anxious anticipations, the radiating realm of faith, belief in God and that miracles could happen provided more positive energy with forgiveness and retentive love emphasized. In 'The White Ribbon', such 'goodness' human elements seem obviously scarce - the single image of the schoolteacher and Eva riding the carriage together stayed with me, echoing their smiles as a slim hope of coming through, thick and thin.If you like Haneke, this is a must-see. If you want to try a Haneke film, go see it with an open mind and leave any figuring out of plot points after the movie, to discuss or further explore (or neither). 'Ordet' of Carl Theodor Dreyer's? Yes, that is a must-see, whether you believe in miracles or not.",6,1,4,11 March 2010
The Fast and the Furious," Stay 'til the very end, after the credits roll, for the conclusive ending
","I wouldn't call this 'trashy' goods. It's a perfectly good Hollywood script. Besides the car 'dueling' action sequences, it includes energy of the younger set (20 something's), the eagerness to experience risks, and the plight to feel the spirit of freedom - even if it's a matter of moments. Death is not an ominous worry to them. They live for the moment.
Paul Walker is in the lead role of Brian, the undercover LA cop. He has worked with director Rob Cohen before in 'The Skulls' 2000. Rob Cohen directed the 'Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story' 1993 with Jason Scott Lee and Lauren Holly. Also 'Dragonheart' 1993, a fable of a legend with Sean Connery doing voice of the Dragon which Dennis Quaid gallantly duels with. Cohen's movies may be Hollywood, yet they tend to have a backbone ethical/living outlook that prompts the integrity of the central character(s).
Vin Diesel is Dominic, the rebellious one here - can past as James Dean, the leader whom the gang looks up to. He stood out in 'Boiler Room' 2000, opposite Giovanni Ribisi, and was the only good thing in 'Pitch Black' 2000, the sci-fi flick which he was the lead opposite Radha Mitchell (from 'High Art' 1998 opposite Ally Sheedy.)Jordana Brewster was last seen as the furiously grieving sister of Cameron Diaz in 'The Invisible Circus' playing opposite Christopher Eccleston (who's in 'Gone in 60 Seconds,' another fast cars and chase flick). Brewster is Dominic's feisty sister Mia, furiously sulky here besides having a chance to be fast (driving, matching up to the testosterone bunch.) Michelle Rodriguez is Dominic's woman, full of anger within, charged with a devil may care defiance. The role of Johnny by Rick Yune has a flavor of Giovanni Ribisi's energy as in 'Gone in 60 Seconds.' But Cohen's 'The Fast and the Furious' is comparably more substantial and colorful in storyline and character development, even comes with a 'dream' quote for the fast and the furious: 'I live my life quarter of a mile per second at a time¬Önothing else matters¬Öin those 10 seconds, I'm free.' And the backbone that held together the friendship between Walker and Diesel's characters is soundly strong.
Be sure to stay on to the very end of the movie - after all the credits roll, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker you'll see, and you get to hear Dominic's quote once again (besides receiving a satisfying closure to the story.)",7,1,1,21 July 2001
The Pianist," Hope against hope - a persistent, undiminishable light capable within (us)
","The Pianist is a beautiful film in spite of the obvious bleak subject: the survival of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew during WWII in Warsaw. The film has much warmth - human spirit a-kindled behind it all. Adrien Brody is simply superb (almost surreal) in his true to life portrayal of Szpilman - tenacity and courage personified beyond reproach. We get to see a quieter side of Brody (Eric the war photo-journalist in Elie Chouraqui's 'Harrison's Flowers' 2000, Sam the union organizer in Ken Loach's 'Bread and Roses' 2000, Ritchie in Spike Lee's 'Summer of Sam' 1999) - an impressive, subdued performance all the way. Of course, director Roman Polanski is the sustaining unrelenting force throughout the entire 2 hrs. 28 mins. filmic journey. (In his interview with Charlie Rose on PBS, Brody mentioned that he was expected to lose 30 lbs. in weight to inhabit the lead role's emaciating period, besides prompted to diligently play Chopin on the piano for 6 months, 6 days a week.)This is much more than just another Holocaust movie (neither 'Schindler's List' or 'Sophie's Choice'). It's Polanski's own: he gave the film quite an emotionally restrained treatment, almost felt like a documentary with doses of stark photography, not without hints of poetry at times. Have patience, there is action, suspense, and you shall be rewarded towards last part of the film, with teardrops for sure. Actually, occasional smiles and a chuckle were afforded. It is taut human drama complete - even though we know of the outcome, we still worry and startle, relieve and sigh along with Brody's character at his brush with danger throughout the film. The audience is very much in the first person alone and lonely with Szpilman on the screen. And when joy arrives, it's truly touching.The story is based on Szpilman's book (written 4 years after the war) with screenplay by Ronald Harwood (Cry the Beloved Country 1995, Mandela - TV 1987, The Dresser 1983.) The soundtrack included many Fr√©d√©ric Chopin (1810-1849) piano pieces: Nocturne, Ballade, Prelude, Waltz, Polonaise and Mazurka. Wojciech Kilar provided additional music, and Herv√© de Luze on film editing - both have collaborated on Polanski's 'Ninth Gate, The' 1999, and 'Death and the Maiden' 1994. Cinematography by Pawel Edelman, who was in many film projects by Polish writer-director Andrzej Wajda. Production designer Allan Starski and costume designer Anna Sheppard were involved in Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' 1993. It's worthwhile to visit the official Web site:  Kudos to everyone involved on this project - such integrity and strength, and to R.P. Productions, Focus Features (also distributed Todd Hayne's 'Far From Heaven' 2002), and Studio Canal.Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist' truly deserved the Cannes Film Festival 2002 Palme d'Or award for the Best Feature film.",8,1,1,19 January 2003
City of God," Powerful presentation of a sad, seemingly hopeless social cycle, yet imbibed with verve, samba a-swinging do Brasil
","Yes, CITY OF GOD is an exuberantly sad story, with subtle faith, hope and love throughout. A bold stroke of genius to tell such a tale in this lively fashion - swift and steady, sad and comic, bullets flying, joyful dancing, pausing suspense - all the colors do Brasil.How can a tale of slum child gangsters, killings and revenge be exuberant? But 'City of God,' like Marcel Camus 'Black Orpheus' 1958 and its modern version Carlos Diegues 'Orfeus' 2000 - even in tragedy there's life a-living. The samba music, subtly triste, gives a sense of hope aftermath. Hope lurks as evil does: bands of 7 or 8-year olds, walking away jiving gangster talk and waving guns 'guilelessly.'Director Fernando Meirelles, co-director K√°tia Lund, and their dedicated cast and crew gave us an unforgettable f√™te of a film. It was as if under the guiding voice-over narration of Rocket (Buscap√©) that we're dancing, swaying, samba a-moving through it all - all from the present day, swiftly swirling back to the sixties, then 'beachcomber' seventies, and disco eighties, full circle back to 'the beginning of the ending.' I marveled at the structure the filmmakers have adopted. There are shades of Dickens' stories: atrocious characters and the central 'hero' struggles, like a Shakespearean dark tale with verbal descriptive wit (thanks to subtitles by Jennifer Kafu.) It's a f√™te, alright!There's comprehensive and energetic accounts of the making of 'City of God' at the official site. Director Meirelles' notes, biography, and interviews on how the film project came about, the casting challenge with co-director Lund, who described in detail the circumstances involved and the casting process. Seven main cast members (portrayals of Rocket, Z√©, Bene, Knockout Ned, Tiago, young Li'l Dice, and Carrot*) talked about how they see their character, personal experience on the project, and 'We from the Movies.' The methodic approach to the 'madness' of spending one year selecting 200 of non-professionals out of 2000, coaching them to prepare for the film, encouraging spontaneity, sounds like a structured experimentation. Camera crew literally followed the cast and action rather than traditional memorizing of dialogs and adhering to logistics. The production result, as we can see, is amazing! * Carrot was Matheus Nachtergaele, a more known actor who was asked to 'disappear into the film and mix in' with the rest of the non-professional cast. An interesting story within a story. Check out the official site for more CITY OF GOD appreciation.Perhaps CITY OF GOD would be given recognition and exposure during Oscar time. As the director repeated: the characters are not the focus, it's the place Cidade de Deus - 'favelas and tenement housing projects' - its social status and products not singular to Brazil (reminds me of Mortimer Adler's 1991 book title 'Haves Without Have-Nots' - the diametrical extremes of the rich and the poor is universal).Hope lurks: a delight as the story turns to our 'hero' - change of flavor in storytelling ('how I became a photographer.') - seeing him rocketing through the decades, the streets, and back to the beginning of the end. Isn't that the 'darndest' chicken chase? The swift sound of knife utensil a-clashing.didn't it grab your attention from the very beginning, sight & sound, with swinging beats? Do stay through the credits roll at the end - you'd get to see the real Knockout Ned saying the very same lines as were on screen. The truth hits - based on real events in Paulo Lin's novel, CITY OF GOD is overwhelmingly powerful.",8,0,2,2 February 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Exciting stillness from director Ang Lee; a must for fans of Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh; a dazzling performance from newcomer Zhang Zi Yi
","I am thoroughly impressed. It was breathtaking. I came to see Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh -- I am satisfied. What a matching pair -- together they are simple stillness and 'yun' (Chinese respected virtue of tolerance & restraint) personified. I also discovered the talented Zhang Zi Yi who portrayed Jen -- a pulsating performance! I felt the title 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is very much about her character: one who's seemingly tame (so young and green) on the surface, yet such skills and potential underneath. She is the center of the story being woven. Chow and Yeoh are essentially complementing Zhang -- the influence and outcome of her character Jen. There are revealing life lessons for the impetuous Jen, a cloistered talented one lacking guiding disciplines and worldly 'Giang Wu' experience. ['Giang Wu' literally means (heroic warriors) roaming the rivers and lakes]Director Ang Lee's last film 'Ride With the Devil' 1999 (with Tobey Maguire in the lead role, also included Jewel, another young female talent discovery) was very much an epic film with sweeping civil war scenes and horseback ridings, integrated with the storyline of exceptional friendships and a bit of romance.In 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', there are multiple levels of friendship depicted and it's more involved on romance, be it subtle or exciting. First off is the mature, quietly understanding relationship between Mudan masters Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien (Chow is a pillar of steadfastness and Michelle gave us the demure dramatic side of her); then there's the fiercely energetic pair of young lovers Jen and Lo; also the conflicting bonding between the weary-beaten Jade Fox and her conceited prot√©g√©e. Sure sounds awfully complex. Yet Ang Lee unfolds the story in such flowing and serenely exciting rhythms: there are well-designed martial art movements delivered; well-planned photo angles captured -- especially those wide and high aerial (location/scenery) shots that defined transitions; befitting choices of music, be it straight drumbeats, a lyrical piece, or the heart-strings a-pulling cello playing by Yo-Yo Ma, all complemented the exceptional performances from the cast. Sony Picture Classics, once again, gave us a rewarding film to relish and enjoy. It's a definitively well-made film. Bravo to all involved in this production¬Öthe three screenwriters and all! While Jackie Chan's ' The Legend of Drunken Master' 2000 USA, a martial arts film (about Wong Fei Hung) full of amusing moments and actions, is successful in pleasing the audience on a less cerebral level, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is successful in its artistic integration of dramatic storytelling and superb martial art movements on a just as entertaining level, with suspenseful moments and climatic scenes one after another. They are different yet both worth seeing -- both demonstrate appreciation of the martial arts.Along the lines of worth seeing Chinese films (with depiction of Chinese women's status), 'Genghis Khan' is not to be missed. It's an epic film about the glorious legendary figure in Chinese history, and it's very much a story about Khan's mother being the staple strength behind his successful career; plus the photography of the battle scenes are artistically rendered in painterly soft hues -- retaining the sensitive strength of the script. Another must see if you appreciate filmmaking.",8,0,0,23 December 2000
The Hurt Locker," Excellent engrossing film: you are not exactly seeing a war movie - you are watching highly-skilled professionals at work, literally in front and behind the cameras
","It's not so much that director-producer Kathryn Bigelow's film 'The Hurt Locker' (with realistic screenplay by journalist and producer Mark Boal) is an intensely suspenseful war action docudrama, but that it is an intimately close look at three professional persons being seriously good at what they do as technicians of a special bomb unit, what their everyday life at work is about, and the time and place happen to be in 2004 Iraq. That is saying a mouthful. Bigelow and her expert film-making team have delivered exactly so: a remarkably perceptive insider view into the workings of the three main characters. Perfect casting of Jeremy Renner as Staff Sgt. William James - the one and only, master of his trade, flawless and grounded yet very much a human man; Anthony Mackie as Sgt. J.T. Sanborn - the stoic, staunch soldier man not at all invulnerable; Brian Geraghty as Specialist Owen Eldridge - the one that brings us all back to earth, the joys and pains.The storyline and scenarios are complicated, technically difficult, yet the expert attention to the challenging sets and locations, action details definitively show the relentless efforts behind this extraordinary and important film. (More superlatives.) You won't have time thinking of superlatives as the film is so engrossing, and the pace kept going, that you can practically feel the intensity, the pressure, the danger, the anguish, and 'whew!' you get to breathe only when the characters get to breathe.This film covers every sense of the following words: intensity, intelligence, expertise, exactitude, explosives, details, death, uncertainty, camaraderie, family - yes, it's a mouthful. 'The Hurt Locker' is a rare diamond of a film that needs to be seen, experienced and appreciated. Kudos to Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, and 'The Hurt Locker' cast and production team - so impressively real are the sound effects, camera close-up's, sets and extras, editing must be murderously precise! Note about the film title is found on the official site 'thehurtlocker-movie.com': 'In Iraq, it is soldier vernacular to speak of explosions as sending you to 'the hurt locker'.' The ever so slight of a Hollywood touch might be attributed to brief appearances related to the plot, that of Guy Pearce (Sgt. Matt Thompson), Ralph Fiennes (Contractor Team Leader), and David Morse (Col. Reed). Good to see their participation and support to Bigelow's film!",9,12,19,8 October 2009
The Illusionist," Edward Norton is intensely persuasive, and the whole film is captivating, plot in suspension - ever the 'mindbending' reservation of truth or illusion
","'The Illusionist' is a treat of a period costume drama which we've not seen much lately in cinema ('Age of Innocence' and 'Somewhere In Time' came to mind). Hollywood is not short of epic period movies with action/battle scenes. Here, it's a different kind of battle - one of the mind - an almost 'whodunit' plot line weave in with romantic love story and 'mindbending' magic. A remarkable feature film formidably delivered by writer-director Neil Burger, with supportive producers who are just as passionate about the production of this film. The magic is not of the 'usual' kind employing mere tricks to the eye - it is more perceptual and hypnotic.Impressed by Edward Norton's performances ever since his chilling antagonist role in 'Primal Fear' 1996 opposite Richard Gere, and in 'American History X' 1998, he practically outdone himself. Following 'Fight Club,' he made his directorial debut 'Keeping the Faith' 2000, taking a break from his intense roles and having fun acting with Ben Stiller and Jenna Elfman in the delightful romantic comedy. With Julie Taymor's 'Frida' and Spike Lee's '25th Hour,' he's such a skillful actor that there's no disappointment ever. In 'The Illusionist,' his focused intensity is mesmerizing and sure grabbed audience, on screen and in cinema, alike. He would make a person disappear in front of your eyes. Will he make himself disappear, too? The question did cross my mind for an instance. The involving story (a magician, a countess, an inspector and a prince at the turn of the century Vienna) continues to be evolving, as we follow Paul Giamatti's Inspector Uhl - we are caught up with his questions and suspicion, and the challenge from the Prince's skepticism on hoax magician and his ambition to 'modernize' the monarchy.Everything about 'The Illusionist' is superior: the re-creation of the period (in Prague and T√°bor of the Czech Republic), the interior and exterior locales (castles/fields, theaters/city streets), the costumes (aristocrats/commoners), armory (swords/pistols), equestrian/carriage details, set decoration, production design. Cinematography by Dick Pope (who worked on many Mike Leigh's films); music by Philip Glass (can't be more befitting); of course, adapted screenplay and direction by Neil Burger. The cast is impeccable: besides Norton, Giamatti took on a mustache and beard (well, they all do), and a different tone to his voice to become Chief Inspector Uhl - turning in another convincing performance. Rufus Sewell ('Dark City,' 'Dangerous Beauty' 1998) as the Crown Prince Leopold, he certainly is - his demeanor and that 'unbesmirchable' arrogance, indeed. Jessica Biel (in Rob Cohen's 'Stealth' 2005, boldly right up there next to Josh Lucas and Jamie Foxx) as the serene beauty of Countess Sophie, yet the inner strength exudes for a turn of the century woman. Her scenes with Norton (first time we get to see him with a quiet intimate side) are wonderfully captured.Yes, truth or illusion? 'What you see is illusion.' Do you believe that? There is suspense and mystery and not until the end - well, could Uhl's deduction be reality? We want it to be true. Whatever it is, 'The Illusionist' is a masterful film, enjoyable at best. Highly recommended.(The teaser trailer of w-d ('Memento,' 'Batman Begins') Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' for fall release has an impressive cast with Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson - an alluring film about magicians and the mystery of their tricks?)",8,1,1,4 September 2006
Million Dollar Baby," A vintage of a film by Clint Eastwood -- for mature appreciation, no doubt
","A rare true depiction of life's fragility - its dilemma of hopes and dreams, risk taking and facing mishaps - can we ever avoid, do we always blame - does God care? 'Birth, Aging, Sickness, Death' are inevitable stages to one's life cycle (a Chinese traditional saying).I really like this Clint Eastwood film. Besides directing, producing, and performing in 'Million Dollar Baby,' Eastwood also did the music which was simply well-integrated and perfectly composed to match and quietly enhance the plot progression, the mood, and the reaction of the characters. This is a gutsy film, gritty in emotions. It can be a tear-jerker yet not at all sentimental. It tells it like it is - the down to earth hard living of boxing (the theme being a 'crutch'), while the crux of the story concentrates on three main characters (each with haunting past): Eastwood as Frank the weathered boxing trainer, Hilary Swank as Maggie the enthusiastic spark in this whirl of boxing energy, and Morgan Freeman as 'Scrap' - besides being the voice-over narrator, provided the bridging catalyst as the cool and caring mainstay to both Frank and Maggie. There are sprinkles of wit and humor here and there - that's how life is: making up of laughter and smiles occasionally in the midst of challenges and struggles, joys and disappointments, hesitation and reinforcement of faith, plucking up courage to take that risk, and mishaps nevertheless happen. There is 'whose life is it anyway' dilemma - the confrontation of death, to be or not to be. Reminds me of the theme of Alejandro Amen√°bar's 'The Sea Inside' (a film I've yet to catch - it was shown for only a few days just before Christmas week. A good film with tough subject is so hard to come by.)Since 'True Crime' 1999 (which I appreciate and posted comments), I prefer this Eastwood endeavor more than 'Mystic River' 2003, 'Blood Work' 2002, 'Space Cowboys' 2001. Here we have basically a simple story in structure (screenplay by Paul Haggis), focusing on only three main characters (not ensemble casts we've been getting so often lately). This is not exactly a total upbeat film, but it is poignantly true in the expression of feelings, conversations, and the inevitably linked relationships between them - unspoken support to each other in being alive, appreciating living and respecting death.Yes, the subject of death is not being shied away - it's approached head on with no circumventing the issue. With the ending of year 2004, the many events that involved increasing number of deaths, debate on wars, disasters, religious beliefs - the question of faith does come into play. There are no straightforward answers to questions of morality or the right thing to do - God's or man's decision (one believes that God works in mysterious ways for reasons one may not understand fully). And so the ending, be it a resigned assumption or not, it boils down to trusting one's heart with faith. And Freeman's calm voice closes well as it began - almost with a poetic touch to the tone.The music lingered on (Lennie Niehaus orchestrated) beyond the credits roll. 'Million Dollar Baby' - a loaded title (precious Maggie that appeared from nowhere; replacing an empty spot of an unreachable daughter; the professional status Maggie attained; takes a lot of heart to train her; takes a lot of courage to fulfill her request). The film did present and tackled a thoughtful subject after all. This may not be a Hollywood blockbuster, but the three stars' impeccably inhabited roles in this quintessential Eastwood film certainly warrant equal appreciation.",8,3,6,1 January 2005
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A whodunit by its own right, cognitive solutions and resourceful set-up for its next two trilogy companion films
","'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' introduced us to Lisbeth Salander, the heroine focused in Swedish author Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy. It is said that Larsson was impressed by childhood heroine 'Pippi Longstocking' (from the pen of Swedish children's author Astrid Lindgren) who is known to be a brave, independent girl with exceptional stamina and courage. So Lisbeth's character was modeled after Pippi, in a way. A modern Pippi, Lisbeth sure is: fearless, intelligent, uninhibited, and very much in control of herself at the prime age of 24, a loner with a mysterious background.This whodunit is without the involvement of police-detective or inspector (so it's not quite like Poirot or Sherlock Holmes) - we are following two consummate investigative brains, one is that of the ever-revolving, daring Lisbeth Salander's, the other is Millennium journalist Mikael Blomkvist's which is just as bold if not reservedly so. Hence the cognitive, methodical unraveling of the Vander family mystery at hand that Blomkvist was given, by fate if you will, linked up with Salander (reluctantly or not) - together they're on the trail to decode a 'forty year old' murderous secret. The nature of the investigation somehow was very close to Lisbeth's heart and being. The original Swedish title 'Men Who Hate Women' might provide inklings to the topic, then again, is that all there is? Danish director Niels Arden Oplev elegantly delivered the characters and storyline without over-the-top gratuitous action, chase, or gore. Yes, there are certain scenes that are 'unapologetically' frank, physical, sexual or otherwise - but they were crucial to the core of the story and the decoding process of the dark history in stored for our protagonists. (It may not be as grand as the Vatican exposure in 'Angels and Demons', but the suggestion of the Third Reich connection is no small matter, either.)It's been 4 months 12 days since I last saw 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and the detail deductions, investigative discovery steps by the two leads were still vivid in my mind when I recall the film. That's kudos to the impressive portrayals of Lisbeth by Noomi Rapace and Blomkvist by Michael Nyqvist. Together they have played off each other, one fiery and one more reticent, one more venturous and the other cautious, under the thoughtful direction from Oplev, and thanks to a competent production crew of two screenwriters, cinematographer, two editors, composer, production, costume and sound designers, makeup, and talented supporting cast, 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is an entertaining suspenseful thriller, even when you have to read the subtitles, the tension and high drama, you will appreciate, from beginning to end.Whether you'll see all three films in the 'Millennium' trilogy or not, this first installment is worthy of your time if you like movies.",8,1,4,12 August 2010
World Trade Center," Tribute to the concerted rescue efforts and validating inextinguishable spirit & faith vital for survival
","Perhaps no film will ever appease the devastation or recover the monumental losses of affected families, but the fact that 'World Trade Center' the film was made attests to our remembrance of the event. Respectfully dedicated to the dead and the living, director Oliver Stone and fellow producers were brave in having a non action-pack approach to 'WTC' without sensationalism. We were shown reenactment and the dramatic reactions/responses of people involved or cared and wanted to lend a helping hand.Nicholas Cage superbly delivered a restrained, understated performance, along with Michael Pe√±a (the locksmith/father in Paul Haggis' 'Crash' 2005), portraying two New York City Port Authority Police Officers under harrowing disastrous situation. The film may be 'underwhelmed' by the survival segment that 'replicated' the possible interminable feeling of waiting to be rescued. It is relentlessly devastating, energy draining, mind numbing. Yet the fortitude and strength demonstrated to keep going, to have faith (be it wavered or seemingly hopeless) - hanging on with the help of loving memories of family and loved ones - sustained the survival power (in the mind, since physically incapacitated). It is a moving experience in spite of the seeming inactivity. The 'unadorned' photography by Seamus McGarvey, with 'just enough' music by Craig Armstrong, and the effectively 'real' sound design and visual re-creations all enhanced what we see on screen.Besides the core performances of Cage as Sgt. John McLoughlin and Pe√±a as Officer William Jimeno, the script by Andrea Berloff afforded sketches of their wives' reactions poignantly portrayed by Maria Bello as Donna McLoughlin and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Allison Jimeno. One might find the pace slow with the survival segments or even the rescue scenes - but if to compare what the survivors, rescuers, families had gone through in real time - the actual waiting period is much more than a mere 2 hours we sat through at the cinema.Also recommended: the TV film 'Flight 93' 2006 (directed by Peter Markle, written by Nevin Schreiner) is a very good docudrama. It was done with respect, sensitivity, and truly dedicated to the families involved. Included on DVD are interviews with filmmakers, behind the scenes insight.The film 'United 93' 2006 by UK director Paul Greengrass (who gave us 'Bloody Sunday' 2002), is objective and well-delivered, tightly scripted by Greengrass himself. DVD to release on Sept 5, 2006.",8,1,4,28 August 2006
Blood Diamond," Everything you want from a suspense adventure movie and a cut above: this one informs about 'conflict diamonds,' 'child soldiers' - gritty livelihoods beyond US
","'Blood Diamond' is the story of Solomon Vandy (the fisherman, the family man, the father - passionately portrayed by Djimon Hounsou) in Sierra Leone who by circumstance, ran into Danny Archer (the soldier of fortune, loner without family ties - Leonardo DiCarprio is Archer, accent and all) from 'Rhodesia' who by chance met Maddy Bowen (the persistent war correspondent - a naturally convincing journalist by Jennifer Connelly) an American who's been in Capetown for three months. Story spans from Sierra Leone, Africa, cross continents to London, United Kingdom. [1] Director Edward Zwick (and his producing partner, Marshall Herskovitz of Bedford Falls Productions - gave us 'The Last Samurai' 2003 with Tom Cruise) once again delivered a memorable meticulously executed film journey, with well-researched informative story subjects. [2]By Hollywood standard, it is an entertaining film with involving drama of intersecting lives crossing paths and superb performances from the three leads (and a solid debut from young Kagiso Kuypers as Dia Vandy the son), with well-paced action & sound of explosive city-in-turmoil military scenes. Yet no scenes are gratuitous: scenes of war, civil or any scale, are never mind-settling; the 'child soldiers' segments felt 'documentary-real' - mind-boggling (can they really do such 'heinous' things?), and on diamond mining - provocative (is that how diamonds are extracted from the earth? Is human kindness ever universal?) Script by Charles Leavitt ('K-PAX' 2001, 'The Mighty' 1998), cinematography by Eduardo Serra ('Girl With A Pearl Earring' 2003, 'What Dreams May Come' 1998), music by James Newton Howard (w-d M. Night Shyamalan's films; 'Batman Begins' 2005) and proficient production team complemented the sensitive (ever perceptive and responsible) direction by Zwick. Some scenes could be difficult to take, but this is an engaging, touching film, and informing (eye-opener) to worlds beyond 'us'. 'Conflict Diamonds' and 'Child Soldiers' are existing realities, 'Blood Diamond' the film has made a difference, the crew, production and distribution companies. It's a movie not to be missed. [1] Sierra Leone is a country on the Atlantic coast of northwest Africa. Formerly a British colony, it became independent in 1961. Its capital is Freetown. Population 2 million. [2] There are detail behind the scenes production notes accessible on the official Web site at 'blooddiamondmovie.warnerbros.com'. The 'EYEWITNESS' section tells how director-producer Ed Zwick connected with documentary filmmaker Sorious Samura (his actual experience in Sierra Leone and 'Cry Freetown'), who became the 'soul of the production.'",8,3,6,11 December 2006
Pride & Prejudice," So glad I saw this 2005 version - director Wright with Moggach's screenplay, pairing of Knightley and MacFadyen as Lizzie and Darcy, is charming and endearing
","A&E's 1995 mini series with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth will still be my favorite version of Austen's beloved novel, with adaptation by the prolific writer Andrew Davies and direction by Simon Langton. But this feature debut from director Joe Wright, with Deborah Moggach's screenplay of Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' is very much appealing and enjoyable in its own right. The production is superb. The cinematography by Roman Oshin certainly enchants - such facility with the use of natural lighting and optimizing the sun as an 'accomplice' to the visual beauty delivered. We are truly transported, particularly at the beginning and ending 'sun burst' scenes.The flowing music by Dario Marianelli, with just the right tempo and piano notes, provides the accompanying rhythm to the story progression. As we see people gathered for dancing at the assembly hall, we'd want to join in and dance along as well. The settings have such a down to earth tone and inviting warmth, especially being at the dining table or in the drawing room of the Bennet's. Brenda Blethyn is ever so lively and blithely as the matron of the family with five daughters. Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennet underplayed is aptly low-key in just the right way. The scenes between him and Knightley were so well matched - the fatherly love for his favorite daughter glows as he sits quietly in that decision-making library. When we're outside, nature is in touch and there's constant birds chirping that we can hear.Keira Knightley, since first saw her in 'Bend It Like Beckham' 2002 and thoroughly enjoyed 'Pirates of the Caribbean' with her opposite Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp, is here with Matthew MacFadyen (who doesn't look 11 years senior to Knightley at all), and what a romantic pair they are. Rosamund Pike is sisterly Jane the eldest; talented Jena Malone is Lydia, the eloping one. Tom Hollander's portrayal of Mr. Collins is rather marvelously delivered - he gave it more of a human touch and comes across not at all 'odious'. Of course, Dame Judi Dench flawlessly delivered Lady Catherine De Bourg. The whole production is quite bubbly and ever effervescent with giggles and laughter. Every scene was thoughtfully choreographed, well demonstrated by the romantic arguing rainy scene of Lizzie and Darcy. (How cool is that.) I can see this version multiple times. It's a perfectly endearing film. Perhaps the fact that I haven't seen MacFadyen in any other film before helps. (Now I can catch up and see him in 'Spooks' / 'MI-5' British TV series.)",8,3,6,23 May 2006
The Last Samurai," The Last Samurai - a labor of love dedicated to the spirit of the Samurai warriors
","'The Last Samurai' 2003 and 'The Last of the Dogmen' (1995 d: Tab Murphy, with Tom Berenger and Barbara Hershey in the lead) are both films with the theme of the 'last' of warrior spirits (one is Samurai, one is Cheyenne). The production of The Last Samurai is well worth seeing - the glory of a large-scale Hollywood production it is. From the research of the historical Japanese Meiji period, the mannerisms, the way different classes of people dress, the settings, the battle weapons and armory, how the Samurai train and fight, to the study and appreciation of the Art of War - where men of honor and integrity in service to the Emperor is the thing to die for. The film title in three Kanji characters means The Way of the Warrior (Samurai). The one character shown on screen at the very beginning (romanization: Sze) meant in the service of the King. Hence the definition of Watanabe's Samurai lifelong one true goal - to serve his Emperor, one and only, and to die in the service of the Emperor would be an honor.The film, directed by Ed Zwick, is truly a combined labor of love of everyone involved. From the producer-lead actor Tom Cruise and Zwick's film-making partner Marshall Herskovitz, cinematography by John Toll and film score by Hans Zimmer, to the costuming details, diverse casting, location scouting all the way to New Zealand and training of the supporting cast - even the official Web site with extensive production notes - all provide enhanced appreciation of this remarkable film. The storyline and drama of 'The Last Samurai' evoke various level of emotions, pulling the heartstrings of the audience with high emotional energy - suspense, sadness, smiles, empathy, joy.'Kagemusha' by Akira Kurosawa, of course, is the ultimate grandeur of a historic Samurai epic. 'The Last Samurai' is comparable in drama and treatment if not with equal passionate efforts all round. Both are available on DVD with special features of audio commentary and the making of 'featurette' and more.",8,86,164,2 October 2005
Invincible," Wahlberg and Kinnear seem so easy wearing their roles naturally in this NFL sanctioned film about Philadelphia Eagles' Vince Papale and Coach Dick Vermeil
","Both Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear are such naturals in delivering their characters. When in fact, from the production notes, Wahlberg went through actual football training/coaching, being there with the team for every play and practice, gaining insight into his portrayal of a real living person. Both met their inspired 'hero'. For Kinnear, he received confirmation when Vermeil's son indicated that he got his father's mannerism/cadence spot on. The operative word here is 'genuine,' caring and intensely so. They worked hard preparing and learning to correctly portray the two NFL notables.Papale and Vermeil - they needed each other (or fate brought them together). In a way, both are in the same boat: struggling to gain confidence by the rest of the team. Against all odds, they did it and won over the rest of the South Philly Eagles team and the PA fans. Yes, it is inspirational. Yes, it's been told before. Why so different? This film being NFL sanctioned is the more earnest in getting it right in every respect for authenticity. The shots of the different plays and athletic moves get up close and real with a trained acting team and augmented sound design.Double duty as director of photography and director of his debut feature film, Ericson Core, faithfully puts us in the year 1976 recreated. The Jim Croce song that started the film 'I Got A Name' is reminiscently catchy and hints at the personal struggles of Papale. With Sara Knowles ('Gattaca') production design, Susan Lyall ('Mississippi Masala') costume design, vital Football Coordinator Mark Ellis ('Miracle') who studied/choreographed the plays and moves for specific film shoot, and having Vince Papale and Dick Vermeil as consultants at hand, Brad Gann's script and a strong supportive team of producers, all made 'INVINCIBLE' unarguably a worthwhile film to see.I went into the cinema with no expectations - feeling fortunate to see Wahlberg and Kinnear both in one movie. I find the film heartwarming (a tearjerker for me, too). It encourages roots: remember the buddy friends, neighborhood community and parents who'd stand by us. The tenacity to not give up - keep trying, focus on task at hand - doing your best is no failure no matter what others may think. The integrity of one's character and believing in oneself is not easy to sustain in hard times. Support system close to you is important: Papale has Janet's encouragement and Vermail has his wife's timely reminders. We need such spirits genuinely emanated in films like 'Invincible.' Greg Kinnear came a long way from the remake of 'Sabrina' opposite Harrison Ford. His diverse roles in 'As Good As It Gets' opposite Jack Nicholson, 'Auto Focus' opposite Willem Dafoe, 'The Matador' opposite Pierce Brosnan, and 'Little Miss Sunshine' along with an ensemble of talents, demonstrated how vastly skillful he's become. Mark Wahlberg can be underrated - it's almost all him in 'Boogie Nights', funny fantastic in 'The Big Hit', quietly solid in 'The Yard' (opposite James Caan), 'funkily' good in 'Rock Star', smooth action in 'The Italian Job' remake, gritty action in 'Four Brothers' - he holds his own in a wide variety of complex and challenging roles, be it 'Three Kings' or 'I Heart Huckabees'.",8,27,29,30 August 2006
The Da Vinci Code," The much anticipated film version did justice to Brown's famous yarn - the fact that they did it within the 'economy' of 2 hours 29 minutes is no trivial task
","Applause to director Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman - what a daunting task of trying to condense the 454 pages of detail from Dan Brown's book to screen. The film version will have to stand on its own - it's a mystery-suspense Hollywood movie. The myriad of back-stories are selectively dispensed of or being audio-visually presented in overlapping/simultaneous effect, so the 'historical' explanations and 'technical' rationales are not short-changed. The story is successfully delivered. It's rather marvelous to see how particular descriptions are cinematically interpreted.I have read the book the summer of 2004. I actually read all four (back to back) of Dan Brown's novels: Angels and Demons; Deception Point; Digital Fortress; and, The Da Vinci Code. Somehow the details I remember most are from 'Angels and Demons.' Perhaps the Rome locations were fresh in my mind as I was just there in April and visited multiple times the Vatican City, St. Peter's Basilica, Papal Mass and all.Audrey Tautou is truly perfect for the role of Sophie Neveu playing along side Tom Hank's Robert Langdon. There is such an air of sincerity in their quest for the 'truth' behind that wooden box with a rose. Tautou's wistful 'Amelie' expressions mixed with earnest 'A Very Long Engagement' inquisitiveness, missing nary a hint of regal descent, she is. Hanks the professor, the 'symbologist', the ever resourceful optimist, a problem analyzing continuum, he is. With the always animated, 'fathomless' reservoir of knowledge is Sir Ian McKellen as the essential Sir Leigh Teabing - delightful as ever. The thoughtful and lavish casting and production, along with Hans Zimmer's score, enhanced the atmosphere and made the puzzles of anagrams, symbols, 'cryptex' all the more fun to follow. They did it: all the key points and elements are there on screen. The Da Vinci Code - the movie, is an achievement in itself, thanks to the collaboration of Columbia Pictures and Imagine Entertainment, producers with Brian Grazer and John Calley, and executive producers with author Dan Brown himself. Give it a fair chance - see it and enjoy.",7,4,6,23 May 2006
A Beautiful Mind," An entertaining film of substance and delight. Not at all morbid in spite of the 13-letter 's' word. There's dashes of humor, bemusement a-plenty.
","To tell a story about a schizophrenic person is a challenge in itself. Yet director Ron Howard delivered a literally entertaining suspenseful film with equal sensitivity, revolving around the backbone storyline of the love relationship between two persons - John and Alicia Nash, fascinatingly portrayed by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly. It's a heart-warming film, ultimately uplifting. It affirms that with tenacity and persistence, loving and steadfast supportive companionship, hope - life's staple, will thrive and grow. Do not just give up and be overcome by other's opinions of you.
It is a beautiful mind. Such fascination with the world he sees, envisions. It captivates, enchants, delights and bewitches. Confuses, too. Is it for real? Is it only fictional in his mind? Nevertheless, it's a beautiful mind. Period. Infinity. It's a M√É¬∂bius strip. Reminds me of the world of M.C. Escher - it's science and fiction, mathematical and sensational. The nurturing of such a beautiful mind, as director Howard points out, is the robust element of love, tender & care. To go to a movie with expectations of accuracy and truth in its delivery does set oneself up for disappointment. A movie is a movie is a movie. It is not a factual documentary, an A&E Biography, or E! channel's Scandal for that matter. Drama, in every sense of the word, is not real. It mimics a situation, its emotional characteristics, and actors give performances for our viewing pleasure. We are fortunate to have passionate filmmakers who produce films of substance. It's best to take the film for what its worth and enjoy the creative talents of the collaborative effort. Filmmakers may try to be as close to facts as possible, but they all have disclaimers at the end of credit roll for any fictitious injections in the film. So why stop yourself from appreciating the film with nagging doubts of accuracy and truth. Like the ever changing/generating molecules, truth is but for the moment it existed. The excellent performances by the two leads, Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, truly deserve the Golden Globe Awards, along with Akiva Goldsman for his screenplay, and longtime producing partners of Imagine Entertainment, Brian Grazer and Ron Howard. 'A Beautiful Mind' is further graced by fine supporting performances: Ed Harris - never disappoints, be it light in 'Milk Money,' heavy in 'Third Miracle,' all-encompassing in 'Truman Show,' passionate in 'Pollock,' intense in 'Enemy At the Gates' or vulnerable in 'China Moon.' Christopher Plummer - a stroke of genius casting him as we can't tell for sure if he's playing the nemesis again as he often does. Paul Bettany - the brilliant Geoffrey Chaucer of 'A Knight's Tale' who can be tongue-whipping and subtle. Universal Pictures and Dreamworks certainly luck out in joining this endeavor by being distributors of the film, U.S. and worldwide. The eight Oscar nominations included film score by the inimitable James Horner, film editing, makeup (indeed!) besides best picture, director, actor, supporting actress, and screenplay. Cinematography was by master Roger Deakins, whose superior photography quietly complemented the varying moods as the story unfolds. Deakins was behind the two recent Coen Brothers films 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' 2000 - deftly subtle & dim lighted color, and 'Man Who Wasn't There, The' 2001 - indisputably exquisite & artistic black and white. Give yourself a chance to see 'A Beautiful Mind.' Clear your mind and go see it without expectations. Simply enjoy. Yes, believe that 'something extraordinary can happen' in your life.",8,0,2,20 February 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," The worthy companion and enjoyable summer blockbuster to 'Batman Begins' vs. 'War of the Worlds' or 'Bewitched'
","With the tremendous success of 'The Bourne Identity' 2002 and 'The Bourne Supremacy' 2004, director/producer Doug Liman is established as a filmmaker who truly understands what makes an action/suspense movie work. This summer's 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' with the pairing of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie once again firms up Liman's credibility and peerless delivery of a blockbuster supreme.'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is sheer fun and chemistry. Definitely Hollywood packaged, valued entertainment product. If you want star power - sure got it with Pitt and Jolie. If you want fun and action (over the top explosive effects) - 'tis solidly included even with dashes of romantic notions for the taking. Yes, the beginning scene (in front of therapist/counselor) seems to be a departure/side-stepping scene, reminded me of 'When Harry Met Sally' - the talk/exchange about marriage has its subtle stabs at humor. It's a slick, stylish, hi-tech bullet-flying movie, literally about a couple of assassins. Thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining. (Of course you're not supposed to take any of the plot seriously. Sheer amusement.) The title is reminiscent of Hitchcock's only comedy, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' 1941, with screwball comedy queen, Carole Lombard opposite Robert Montgomery. In a way, I felt Liman has injected some of the principles of screwball comedy into his 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith,' and he knows where to draw the line and keeps the action sequences exciting and effectively congruent with the 'quieter' segments - not letting go of the suspense thread loosely.For this movie experience, I felt the music by John Powell played an important part in complementing the action sequences and repartees between the two leads. Kudos to Liman's direction and vision, tight and enjoyable plots kept well in rein. Of course, Pitt and Jolie delivered charming performances to no end, even 'simply' doing action stunts.",7,4,9,5 July 2005
The Departed," The popular Hong Kong police-triad drama 'Infernal Affairs' has a solid screenplay, enabled 'The Departed' a worthy adapted version with its stellar cast
","When I saw the trailer for 'The Departed' - just snippets from the movie, I thought how very much like Hong Kong's 'Infernal Affairs' aka 'Mou Gaan Dou' 2002. There's no mention up front that it's a remake, but the impressive quadruple leads with Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen plus Mark Wahlberg, under Martin Scorsese's direction is simply irresistible. For first-time viewers who didn't get to see the original Hong Kong's 'Infernal Affairs,' the western back-story, characters and screenplay adapted to U.S. setting as a police-Mafia movie can stand on its own.For those who have appreciated 'Infernal Affairs' Hong Kong delivery, subtitles and all, with the irreproachable Tony Leung Chui Wai (in many director Wong Kar Wai's films: 2046; In the Mood For Love; Happy Together; Chungking Express) playing opposite the ever versatile singer-actor-can do no wrong Andy Lau (in 'Full-time Killer' and many popular Asian romantic comedies, love stories, action drama, period or contemporary) - there is no comparison to the superior original. The layered plot line, the subtle performances from both cop & mole 'undercovers' - the literal translation of the Chinese film title can be 'no defining boundaries/rules' - a cop as mole and a mole as cop mixed in the police and triad worlds. How the writers came up with such an intriguing plot is beyond fascination. (Dialogs in 'The Departed' mostly can be picked up as direct translation from the Hong Kong version; the female part is expanded more for Vera Farmiga, just as Wahlberg's role is more fleshed out and critical, too.) The collaborative efforts of co-directors, Lau Wai Keung and Mak Siu Fai, with strong supporting cast, namely Anthony Wong as 'Wong Sir' who knows, understands Tony Leung's cop character, while Eric Tsang as 'Hon Sam' the villainous boss that appears to be amiable yet 'black-faced' in an instant - truly made 'Infernal Affairs' an unforgettable Hong Kong film experience. Highly recommend - available on DVD.On remakes in 2006, director Tony Goldwyn's 'The Last Kiss' adapted by writer Paul Haggis (again), who provided steady ingredients for Zach Braff to shine in the leading role, and quite an opportunity for Blythe Danner paired with the ever so nuanced Tom Wilkinson as the parents - the remake version is actually satisfying with a more fulfilling ending than the rather abrupt one in the Italian original 'L'Ultimo Bacio' 2001.",7,0,1,22 November 2006
Love Actually," How reassuring that love IS actually all around us -- unabashedly optimistic 'Love Actually' is.
","British writer Richard Curtis' directorial debut of his own script 'Love Actually' is an ambitious endeavour -- a big heart packaged to encompass the world. It could very well be as grand a scale as 'The Last Samurai' with cast of extras just as plenty (imagine the airport scenes) besides managing nine concurrent stories about love. He pulled it off successfully with a stellar casting by Mary Selway and Fiona Weir. Bill Nighy's Billy Mack rock singer story is used as the staple timeline the other stories revolve -- it's countdown with 5 weeks to Christmas. Here, Hugh Grant's Prime Minister role is not exactly the main one, each of the other stories share its sum of on-screen time. Some of the characters do cross each other's path. For example: Emma Thompson's Karen is sister to Grant's PM, her husband (Alan Rickman) Harry's secretary Mia turns out to be neighbor of Natalie's (Martine McCutcheon). The story of Liam Neeson's Daniel and his 11 year old stepson Sam is a hit. Thomas Sangster played Sam (his sixth acting endeavour and first feature in 2 years) certainly tugs at our hearts by his innocent love pursuit. You'll find satisfactory rationale to all this in Curtis' genuinely thoughtful dialogue. He's never flippant about any aspect of the subject at hand. Not even when he showed us John and Just Judy -- just the right restrained dosage of comedic pairing of Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as stand-in actors on set. There's the 'triangle' of Keira Knightly (shines in both 'Bend It Like Beckham' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean') as Juliet, Chiwetel Ejiofor (the intriguing Nigerian doctor in Stephen Frears 'Dirty Pretty Things') briefly as Peter her newly wedded husband, and Andrew Lincoln as Peter's best man Mark secretly, hopelessly in love with Juliet.
Life is not all roses, and Curtis is not coy about uncomfortable aspects of love. Karen's (Thompson) suspicion about Harry, the sentiment though sad is eased by the chosen song played at the time. Joni Mitchell's 'Both Sides Now' rings true.  Harry's employee Sarah (Laura Linney from U.S.), her crush on colleague Mark (Rodrigo Santoro) is like a painful fairytale, time may generate hope. Kris Marshall's Colin is certainly the most happy go lucky one: 'coming to America,' meeting dream girls like Denise Richards, Shannon Elizabeth and returning home with him -- such satisfied faces at the airport.I'm most akin to the story of Colin Firth's writer Jamie and his Portuguese-speaking only housekeeper Aurelia played by L√∫cia Moniz. I like it already when Firth sat down at his writing hide-out in the French suburb and said, 'Alone Again, Naturally' -- the title of a popular 1970 song by Gilbert O'Sullivan. The comic yet tender language barrier scenes with subtitles remind me of the Russian/Finnish film 'The Cuckoo' (Kukushka). There are dashes of references to other movies or songs, e.g., Grant doing a 'Tom Cruise Risky Business' singing pose as he starts a gig of a song; Daniel and Sam watching 'Kate & Leo in Titanic' for motivation.
To w-d Curtis' credit, following the 9 stories was not at all confusing. I saw the movie on its opening weekend and the packed audience thoroughly enjoyed the 2 hrs. 15 mins. of laughter and tears. The story scenes intercut each other in an assured pace, like movements of a symphony -- overture, interlude, yes, the finale is well-crafted to the cadence of love IS actually all around -- visual camera at play.   If you're interested in behind the scenes, visit the official Web site of 'Love Actually' -- there are generous production notes including excerpt dialogues and how each story came to be. Enjoy!",7,0,2,12 January 2004
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," A powerful epic from South Korea. It's a tear-jerker for me, through and through, from the very start.
","The nostalgic sepia-toned segment of Seoul 1950, depicting pre-draft happy moments the two brothers shared with friends and family, is touching and heartwarming. But director does not linger there - in fact, the pace of the storyline of 'Taegukgi' (South Korean name for their national flag) is more than tight, it's one event after another, never stops. We see the characters, main and supporting cast, managing the situations as they come. Korean filmmaker, Kang Je-gyu (of 'Shiri') provided a powerful epic film experience. The war scenes of soldiers at camp, in combat, on the move, literally covered a lot of grounds, physically and historically timeline-wise. Yes, it's quite melodramatic. Very much like a Korean opera. An emotional wringer we go through watching the changing situations between big brother Jin-tae and younger brother Jin-seok, the sad tragic scene of Young-shin, Jin-tae's fianc√©e caught between the political muddle of Koreans killing Koreans over suspecting communists involvement (she did nothing wrong other than getting food for family members' survival). Big brother was too sad and furious to continue gloriously fighting for 'country' as he felt the impact of lives loss, went over to the North Korean army, contradictorily fought for the enemy side. Fate did play a hand at every turn. Young brother escaped burning fate, as he's about to get back home to mother and family, he learned of his brother at the opposing war front. He realized how much he has wrongly alienated his big brother. Sigh! No one should be judged for what they do during war - circumstances in war time can change one's psyche and outlook. From 'The Power of Myth' PBS series, in his conversations with Bill Moyers, scholar and teacher Joseph Campbell talked about the [ritual of] people joining the army, putting on a uniform, giving up personal life and accepting a socially determined manner of life in the service of one's society. In times of war, they're acting not as individuals, they're acting as agents of something above them to which they've given themselves. 'To judge them as though they were individual human beings is totally improper.' To all soldiers, defensive or offensive, they are courageous souls who sacrificed their precious family ties and all, risking their lives coping with the unknown. It is humane to respect both the living and the dead.The two leads are engaging: Jang Dong-gun is the big brother (he was detective Kim in 'Nowhere To Hide' 1999) and Won Bin is the younger brother (he's a young popular TV star in South Korea). The multitude of extras for the battle scenes is part of a grand production with effective cinematography, score and sound effects enabling the film depictions being devastatingly real. The layers of plot and the 'all encompassing' facets/effects of war included in the mix may be too much for some - somehow, 2 hours 20 mins. of 'Taegukgi' just came and absorbed. I understand the release of this film in South Korea coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the country's truce with North Korea. The film was very well received (a blockbuster) at home. Other noteworthy war-related films: 'Sergeant York' (directed by Howard Hawks 1941), with Gary Cooper's incomparable portrayal of WWI American hero Alvin C. York. 'Hong Kong 1941' (aka 'Dang doi lai ming' directed by Leong Po Chi 1984) the Chow Yun-Fat movie of the indelible friendship of three during Japanese occupation, how people react and act due to wartime situations for the sake of survival, saving a dear friend - it's dramatic, gutsy and romantic, too. 'Grave of the Fireflies' (aka 'Hotaru no haka' directed by Isao Takahata 1988), the impressive Japanese animated film which is very much about the effects of war - a beautiful story, nevertheless, through the eyes of a young boy and his little sister - however difficult a situation, there is magic in life and in death.",8,18,22,10 October 2004
The Blind Side," Easily the best family movie of 2009, aspiring, inspiring, assuredly transpires hopeful human connections against all odds and social cynicism
","Sandra Bullock is ever so enjoyable to watch in her movies, and I've been attracted to her star power since 'While You Were Sleeping'1995 director Jon Turteltaub's heartwarming tale with Bill Pullman & the ensemble family, and 'Speed' 1994 director Jan De Bont's action ace with Keanu Reeves. Her movies, mostly more 'commercial' and Hollywood, do have their mass appeal. Once in awhile, she gets to play more 'in-depth' roles, like part of the ensemble cast in w-d Paul Haggis' 'Crash' 2004. In 2009, 'The Proposal' is an amusingly fun 'rom-com' outing set in Sitka, Alaska, with Ryan Reynolds as the opposite force. But as Leigh Anne Tuohy, based on true (and current) story-events, in 'The Blind Side' - she absolutely shines as she does, integrated and permeating with her own Sandra Bullock air (energy, oxygen) about her, without losing the essential characteristic qualities of Mrs. Tuohy.Whether she wins the 82nd Academy Awards Best Actress category is beside the point, 'The Blind Side' is a well-produced movie directed by John Lee Hancock, who also wrote the script based on the story of Michael Oher in author Michael Lewis' best-selling book, 'The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game'. The production notes 'downloadable' from the film's official site 'theblindsidemovie.com/dvd/pdf/prodNotes.pdf' is in itself an interesting read. We get to know how Lewis (who was high school pal with Sean Tuohy - Leigh Anne's husband) came to write the story about Oher, and he explained about 'left tackle'. Writer-director Hancock (whose family is very much connected with the game - his father and two brothers all played university football) talks about his perspectives, what he sees as the decisive factors in approaching the film. The fascinating casting process in filling the key roles: the Tuohy family of Leigh Anne the amazing Mom and assertive woman by Sandra Bullock, of Sean the supportive husband and Dad by Tim McGraw, of the caring & fun sister and brother team of Collins and S.J. by Lily Collins and Jae Head, and the surprising turn of finding Quinton Aaron to convincingly play Michael Oher. There's also the real life tutor role of Miss Sue neatly played by Kathy Bates. The producers' illuminating accounts about how the film project came to be and the fruition of the production sure complement the experience of the film. (They've also included some Leigh Anne Tuohy quotes from 'The Blind Side'.) Hancock, who gave us 'The Rookie' 2002 with Dennis Quaid, once again delivered a winning movie, full of human warmth and inspiring elements without being overly sentimental. See 'The Blind Side' and you will hearken to the thankful feeling for what we so fortunately already have - miracle or blessings in disguise. Contentment is a nice place to be.Note: This film somehow reminds me of a (sports) documentary by filmmaker, writer-director Ward Serrill's 'The Heart of the Game' 2005. It was seven years in the making, following a high school basketball team, one stellar central player especially - her trials and tribulations, along with the tenaciously talented coach through the course of the film. The real-life true story is quite 'melo-dramatic' (and tear-jerker sentimental) in spite of it being a documentary. Highly recommended.",8,0,2,7 March 2010
Bruce Almighty," Jim Carrey is back in his elements as Jim Carrey does.
","Recently I saw Julien Temple's 'Earth Girls Are Easy' (1989) on cable and enjoyed all over again the riotous comedic tempo of the alien trio: Jeff Goldblum, Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans, with the infectious Valley girl portrayal of Valerie by Geena Davis. I remember I first appreciate Jim Carrey in 'The Mask' (1994) with the talented Cameron Diaz in her debut role.     'Bruce Almighty' is a parable without a doubt. Jim Carrey back in his elements, with partners in fun - Jennifer Aniston as Grace the girlfriend desirable, and Morgan Freeman as God the friend indispensable. Together they delivered an entertaining tale about how Carrey's character Bruce eventually learned his life lessons and became the model citizen aspired by all. Yes, the comedic tempo basically is 'driven' by the manic energy of Carrey's, but both Freeman and Aniston contributed their subtle humorous touches with just the right dosage to the mix. It was amusing watching the trio, and (not forgetting) the dog, along with the supporting cast, making this Tom Shadyac movie another Hollywood hit.  Director Tom Shadyac's other endeavors include: Patch Adams (1998), a rather serious film with Robin Williams - another manic energy unlimited; and The Nutty Professor (1996 remake) with Eddie Murphy - yet another genius in hilarity.Morgan Freeman is a prolific actor since his famous role as Miss Daisy's chauffeur opposite Jessica Tandy in Bruce Beresford's 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989). I found his two 'Charlie' roles most delightful: he was Charlie in Neil LaBute's 'Nurse Betty' (2000) opposite Ren√É¬©e Zellweger and co., and as Charlie Grimes opposite Ashley Judd in Carl Franklin's 'High Crimes' (2002).
I first appreciate Jennifer Aniston's acting in Edward Burns' 'She's The One' (1996). She carried the central roles in Glenn Gordon Caron's 'Picture Perfect' (1997) opposite Jay Mohr; Nicholas Hytner's 'The Object of My Affection' (1998) opposite Paul Rudd; and Miguel Arteta's 'The Good Girl' (2002) opposite Jake Gyllenhaal and co. She gave steady supporting roles to Mark Wahlberg in Stephen Herek's 'Rock Star' (2001), and to Ron Livingston in Mike Judge's 'Office Space' (1999).Jim Carrey's more serious drama roles include: Frank Darabont's 'The Majestic' (2001) opposite Martin Landau and co.; Peter Weir's 'The Truman Show' (1998) opposite Ed Harris, Laura Linney and co.; and the controversial dark menacing role of the cable guy opposite Matthew Broderick in Ben Stiller's 'The Cable Guy' (1996).",7,0,1,1 June 2003
Casino Royale," 'The name is Bond, James Bond' - Daniel Craig certainly earned it - this one literally with balls
","Kudos to the 'Casino Royale' 2006 production efforts, they've made this James Bond 21 worth waiting for. The film's prelude segment in b/w has Daniel Craig rather quietly there, yet the instance as trigger demands, 007 is quick without warning or a blink. He may not be as suave looking as the previous Bond's - his is rugged yet smooth, tough yet tender - the Daniel Craig way, indeed. The beginning credit roll graphic sequence is marvelously presented along with a song 'You Know My Name' (performed by Chris Cornell) - the ingenious mix of bold color patterned shapes with miniature Craig the Bond figure delivering his moves, and animated silhouette motion/action integrated with close up of Craig's face for accents - is a visual entertaining delight.'The name is Bond, James Bond' - yes, he has earned it, literally with all guts and balls - Daniel Craig will return 007 strong. When you get to hear John Barry's - correction: realized the original Bond theme composer is Monty Norman - popular James Bond theme music finally delivered with Craig uttering the famous line, one can be ecstatic about the whole (yes, 2 hours 24 minutes long) James Bond 21 film experience. Bravo for Monsieur Craig, and everyone involved in the project, with director Martin Campbell ('Mask of Zorro' fame), three screenwriters with Neal Purvis & Robert Wade (together on James Bond 19 and 20) including Paul Haggis ('Crash' 2005 fame), music by David Arnold (whose music sure accompanied and enhanced every segment and action, chase sequences, the tender moments, with very subtle strains of Norman's original James Bond theme selectively instilled). The cast: first and foremost Daniel Craig solidly portraying James Bond, unswerving Mads Mikkelsen as villain number one Le Chiffre, exquisite looking Eva Green convincingly as Vesper Lynd, Judi Dench firmly as M with unsuspecting sensibility. The plot may not be the tightest, yet as James Bond film series go, its storyline and action sequences kept within high suspense quotient. Those who play/understand poker games may very well have a good time at the casino table scenes plentiful. Besides exciting action requisite, this film is quite dramatic with deeper romantic aspects than any previous Bond outings. You might say Casino Royale 2006's Bond is more down-to-earth - a human who errs, hurts, even battered and vulnerable to death.I remember Craig from his roles in director Roger Michell's two 2004 films: the controversial 'The Mother' (body naked already next to matured Anne Reid) and stalking shadowed 'Enduring Love' (intensely paired with Samantha Morton, playing opposite Rhys Ifan the single-minded nemesis). There's also 'Layer Cake' where Craig portrayed the tough and almost impregnable 'XXXX' in the directorial debut of Matthew Vaughn, producer of Guy Ritchie's crime capers. (All three are 'NFE' not for everyone's taste.)

Just checked the U.S. weekend top 10 and noticed 'Happy Feet' took Number 1 with 'Casino Royale' being Number 2. That should not 'shaken or stirred' Daniel Craig's Bond status - here's wishing sound box office revenue for James Bond 21.",8,6,13,19 November 2006
The Matrix," Dazzling computer special effects and surreal delivery of martialart movements plus underlying save-the-human species storystructure
","Without a doubt, the presentation of this film with its myriad of computerized special effects is spectacular. It's a feast for the eye. A fantastic journey -- though mostly in tones of dark colors -- for the very computer literate. It works very well as a comic book style storytelling in the company of Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano. From the pen and direction of the Wachowski brothers, Andy and Larry (sharply delivered the previous intriguing 'Bound' with Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon and Joe Pantoliano.) 'The Matrix' is imaginative. It's fantasy, yet the undertones can be real.We've had films with similar storyline, Terry Gilliam has two prominent ones: 'Brazil' 1985 and '12 Monkeys' 1995 -- more concentrated on the plot and message vs. dazzling computerized effects, hence more time in deeper delivery of the acting performances along with the story intrigue. Also comes to mind is Alex Proyas' 'Dark City' 1998, especially when we see the long black trench coats! The virtual reality aspect has traces of 'Star Trek' (the out of body simultaneous existence, the beaming back to the ship), and of course, 'Star Wars' (fighting off the bugs/viruses from the ship's steering control platform).The chase scenes, action-explosive scenes, and martial art scenes we've seen/experienced these before. A lot of other film tracks spring to mind: Barry Sonnenfeld's 'Men In Black' 1997 (chases and alien monsters); Stephen Norrington's 'Blade' 1998 (cool martial art movements); John Badham's 'Blue Thunder' 1983 (helicopter in action); John McTiernan's 'Die Hard' 1988 (the shattering glass by non-stop flying bullets); and John Woo's trademark rain of bullet ballet styles. The computer-intensive plot has a trace of the situation in 'Mercury Rising' 1998 with Bruce Willis; reminders of the insightful paranoiac B/W independent film of Darren Aronofsky's 'Pi' 1998; yes, Keanu in 'Johnny Mnemonic' 1995 -- Is this part 2? Keanu's character here is a human with doubts and feelings of his own vs. a go-between android type. (Ah, 'Android' 1982, directed by Aaron Lipstadt is an interesting sci-fi piece with Klaus Kinski as an avid scientist, and Don Opper who plays Max 404 co-wrote the screenplay.)There are steady quiet moments/brief scenes for pause and emotional exchanges, especially the meeting with Oracle, seemingly a surreal scene yet so down-to-earth with human warmth -- for a moment I felt we're in a calm reality with no hurriedness or impending threat. There's also the scene when Morpheus explains to Neo What Is the Matrix -- come to think of it, kinda have tones of George Lucas' 1970 classic 'THX 1138' bland background -- esoterically surreal? Jean-Luc Godard's 'Alphaville' 1965 is a cool French sci-fi fantasy in B/W with no particular special effects but great story that is familiar.The idea of the bureaucratic society in The Matrix reminds me of John Carpenter's 'They Live' 1988.By the way, Hugo Weaving has worn dark shades before in another movie: Jocelyn Moorehouse's 'Proof' 1991 -- he portrayed a blind photographer (no kidding) with Russell Crowe (who was the robotic nightmare SID 6.7 in 'Virtuosity' 1995 opposite Denzel Washington.)Performances are fine all round: Laurence Fishburne always dependable delivery, Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith is as good as it gets, Carrie-Anne Moss is cool moves, and Keanu, his was a decent delivery -- can't ask for more, his presence IS the center of The Matrix. Liquefaction chrome effect is maximized manifold since its introduction in James Cameron's 'The Abyss' 1989. All in all, the Wachowski brothers and co. delivered 'The Matrix' successfully as an opening weekend box office #1 hit. Warner Brothers should be all smiles!Keanu did a pretty good job in Taylor Hackford's 'The Devil's Advocate' 1997, opposite Al Pacino and Charlize Theron. To see him in a more romantic role and hear him sing with Anthony Quinn, try ('Like Water for Chocolate' 1993 director) Alfonso Arau's 'A Walk in the Clouds' 1995.",8,0,0,11 April 1999
Hart's War," It's all Colin Farrell - you see him, hear his voice, from beginning to end
","For what it's worth, I appreciate the film medium interpretation of a book's story, and not try to compare or expect how detail or more poignant the book's descriptions were. Viewing a film, audio and visually taking in the collaborative efforts of a film production is not the same as someone reading a novel. Reading also depends on the environment that you're in: while traveling with people around you, or being quietly by yourself. Reading is very much one person's own interpretation - as one reads, one can conjure up the possible sight and sound in one's mind and imagination. While in a cinema viewing a movie, we are exercising our senses - visual and audio - of what's presented on the screen. The experiences are uniquely different.
In HART'S WAR, Colin Farrell who portrayed Lt. Hart is very much front and centered, while Bruce Willis' role of Col. McNamara, his (humane) attributes are more subtle and from within - his aching insides from the years of war and isolation. There is the struggle/conflict of the war veteran vs. the clean cut affluent background of young Hart. We see Willis' McNamara's treatment with Farrell's Hart more evidently, but for McNamara himself, say the quiet scene where he visited the flyer in isolation waiting for trial - more imminent of death, we simply see him giving Lt. Scott a book; when Scott opens it, it's the New Testament. It is later while Hart's talking with Scott outside the trial room just before the closing arguments, that we learned the book was Scott's own, with a picture of him and wife and child kept within the Bible's pages. So off camera, we may gathered that McNamara must have silently gone through Scott's belongings and took that New Testament to Scott, with the understanding that Scott may find solace in seeing the family picture again and as most soldiers would, felt duty above all else.or would he? And Hart, representing Scott as his defending lawyer, would he let him? Such are the subtle layers to the storyline.Director Gregory Hoblit's previous films were no simple Hollywood plots. They all require some mind stimulating thinking: 1996's 'Primal Fear,' the crime and lawyers film with Richard Gere, Laura Linney, and the fascinating debut 'hell' of a performance from Edward Norton; 1998's 'Fallen', one devil of an intriguing storyline where Denzel Washington, along with Embeth Davidtz, tackling the many faces (Elias Koteas included) of the elusive Lucifer (music was by Tan Dun of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'; 2000's 'Frequency' was the mind-twisting time-bending drama of son and father team, Jim Caviezel and Dennis Quaid. Here in HART'S WAR again, there are no simple answers to the questions raised: moral dilemma, military honors, ravage and trying times of war and being POWs - no escape of endurance tests. It's a well produced film with fine cinematography of stark snowy scenes from Alar Kivilo (who also did 'Frequency' with director Hoblit); score to this war film was complemented (unexpectedly) by British composer Rachel Portman; and performances by a talented cast. I did see 'Stalag 17' and 'The Great Escape' again, but my sense is 'Hart's War' stands on its own, it's not really a humor filled '17' not an action packed 'Escape' movie, it's more of a humane story at its core, offering an aspect of life's outlook, military or not.",7,34,51,5 May 2002
Hart's War," Director Gregory Hoblit's 'Hart's War' stands on its own, with Colin Farrell front and centered
","I saw again 'Stalag 17' and 'The Great Escape' (both quite entertaining films in spite of the war premise) after 'Hart's War.'  My sense is, director Gregory Hoblit's film does stand on its own. It may not have the humor filled '17' atmosphere, nor the action packed 'Escape' storyline, but it is a humane story at its core. It's about character building or disintegrating in times of hardship, offering aspects or the wisdom of life's outlook, military or otherwise.Colin Farrell, who delivered an intense performance in Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' 2000 (and looking forward to his appearance in this summer's 'Minority Report' with Spielberg directing and Tom Cruise leading), once again demonstrated his keen acting portraying Lt. Hart, the central character opposite Bruce Willis' Col. McNamara in 'Hart's War.'  For young Hart who has an affluent family background and was educated as a lawyer, he is fighting the 'war' -- yes, his war at hand, inside the POW camp vs. the literal war outside the barb-wired compound. There's urgency and suspense revolving around his character's encounters, trials and learnings -- things are somehow fast happening in spite of the camouflaged unhurried pace.
Willis gets to be subtle, sullen, and almost silent in his portrayal of Col. McNamara, the nemesis to Hart. He has delivered quiet performances (not so action hero-centric roles) in Robert Benton's 'Nobody's Fool' 1994 (opposite Paul Newman), and Harold Becker's 'Mercury Rising' 1998 (opposite an autistic child), prior to M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' 1999 (opposite Haley Joel Osment). Here in 'Hart's War,' the humane side of McNamara is unobtrusively noted when he's not having confrontations with Hart, for instance the scene where he visited flyer Scott in his cell and calmly handed him a Bible. Subtle persuasions, he has.
This war picture is very much male dominated, however the film is complemented by the music score of British composer Rachel Portman. Cinematographer Alar Kivilo, who has worked with Hoblit on the film 'Frequency', is masterful in delivering the bleak snowy tone of the film. It may be a court drama per se, yet there's no shortage of action and intrigue. 'Hart's War' is a well delivered film, with no simple answers to the reasons why, of things happening, people reacting, circumstances changing¬Ö Like his 'Primal Fear' 1996, 'Fallen' 1998, and 'Frequency' 2000, director Gregory Hoblit's films can be thought provoking.

Moon," Hardly dull watching Sam and Sam again - Sam Rockwell rocks in Duncan Jones' intriguing debut film 'Moon' masterfully done
","Sam Rockwell assuredly delivered all the variations and range of an astronaut Sam Bell in director Duncan Jones' debut film 'Moon'. Yes, it is a space sci-fi based on a story by Jones. The storyline seems to deal with some sort of version control. Could it be a renewed (or rewind) version of the same previous rendition that gets repeated (as programmed)? There is Gerty (calmly voiced by Kevin Spacey). It is much more friendlier than 'HAL' of '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Gerty the computer-brain is quite clear in what he is supposed to do as instructed. He is to help Sam. He is to do what Sam asks him to do. Come to think of it, Gerty probably needs a friend (someone to talk to, play chess with) since he and Sam are the only two working 'units' at the space station (a rather conveniently clever 'techno-arrangement'?) Rockwell is ever so interesting since I first saw him playing opposite John Turturro in Tom DiCillo's 'Box of Moon Light' (1996). Sam Bell is rather lonely being the sole space worker human on the spaceship three years hence. It's getting into a mindless rut of routines, with occasional delight in reminiscing of family members from home on earth and viewing their video messages. Is ground control becoming callous and neglectful of him? Is Sam truly human in the flesh? It sure seems that way on screen, whether he's inside the ship or outside exploring the moonscape. God forbid he's an android in plurality. No programmed robots are expected to have feelings, let alone 'think' for himself. A computer unit like Gerty may momentarily display a certain degree of 'fondness' - though Gerty masks it by saying he's only doing his job in taking care of and carrying out Sam's requests and needs. Perhaps some scientific 'techno-breakthrough' in cost-saving solutions in optimizing cloning? Not dull at all. 'Moon' is absorbing and definitely thought-provoking sci-fi. You may say it is a bold follow up to Stanley Kubrick's sublime '2001: A Space Odyssey' which was very much ahead of its time in 1968 and still rings true today. So Duncan Jones' 1995 bachelor of philosophy's independent study thesis titled, 'How to Kill Your Computer Friend: An Investigation of the Mind/Body Problem and How It Relates to the Hypothetical Creation of a Thinking Machine' - how coincidental that 'Moon' contains elements and queries suggestive from the title! There's possible influence from Jones' father, David Bowie, with his famous 'Space Oddity' song lyrics of 'Ground control to Major Tom'. The film does remind me of Douglas Trumbull's 'Silent Running' (1972) where Bruce Dern is also playing solo in space. I recall also British author Dennis Potter's extraordinary TV series, 'Cold Lazarus' (1996) when the realms of the mind & memories are exploited and 'frozen in time'. You will enjoy 'Moon', sci-fi fan or not. It has made me appreciate and respect Kubrick's '2001' masterpiece much more on repeat viewing, and I continue to ponder on the story of Sam in 'Moon' - wishing for more enlightening, intriguing sci-fi fare from Jones to come. (And it seems a possibility, so 'wikipedia' noted.)",8,1,2,8 October 2009
