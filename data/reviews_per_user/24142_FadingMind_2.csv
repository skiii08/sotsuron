National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Short-Sheeting the Pope's Bed - National Treasure 2
","DISCLAIMER: I have not seen the first National Treasure movie, so I am writing this from a standpoint that does not take in continuity from the first film. If you want a review from someone who has, read another person's review.The only thing I need out of a sequel is that it stands alone well without leaning too much on the first film (i.e., Shrek 2 or 3). National Treasure delivered perfectly, and it allows people to understand the movie well without seeing the first film (Though it helps.) Sure, the plot is filled with many historical inaccuracies and stretches of logic, but if you suspend your disbelief, if only just for a moment, it is just an entertaining film. The only disappointment I suffered was Cibola not being in Las Vegas (The Stand, for those who don't get it).",7,0,0,27 June 2008
WALLÂ·E," The Greatest Pixar Film Yet
","I had high expectations for this movie when I walked into the theater, and all expectations were met beautifully. I am not exaggerating when I say that, in my opinion, Wall-E is the greatest movie John Lasseter & Co. have made, and this is coming from a guy who grew up on Pixar movies (The first movie saw was A Bug's Life) and has seen every movie Pixar has made yet. The graphics were breathtaking, the plot brilliant & original & the characters very well thought out. The movie kept me fixed at the edge of my seat & all of my emotions expressed (not loudly, though). The film gets a bonus star for the homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey (Autopilot).",10,3,7,27 June 2008
