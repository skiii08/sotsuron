First Man," Awesome
",The acting and cinematography were both well done. This film was less about an intriguing storyline and more about the state of mind of the legendary astronaut Neil Armstrong. The dialogue in the film was subdued and it was more about the emotions of the characters. All in all a pretty great film with strong performances by Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy as well as the supporting cast. Another great aspect of the film is that it makes you appreciate what risks and sacrifices some folks made for the purpose of space exploration and discovery - which was inspiring to see!,8,0,1,18 October 2018
