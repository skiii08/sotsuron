Marie Antoinette," Surprisingly good
","I really enjoyed this film. Though everyone else in my party of five who saw it hated it, I really liked it. It is definitely NOT for people who aren't history buffs or people who don't like artistic films. This was a very artsy movie and I really liked how they expressed events through actions a lot of the time instead of in words. I also thought it was awesome how they actually filmed it at Versailles, one of my favorite places in the world. I loved the music and I immediately bought the soundtrack. The cinematography was outstanding, too, and I'm disappointed it was snubbed for the Oscar nomination. There were some parts that got a little long and tedious, but they were beautiful to look at. I loved the ending; it was so classy and perfect. I didn't expect it to be so funny either; it was quite comedic in some parts. :) Overall, I think you have to watch it as a somewhat of a documentary because I think that's the approach Sofia was going for. It is NOT a huge over-dramatic spectacle. It is a richly elegant and subtle film that is really interesting to watch, if, like I said before, you are a history buff. Or if you are intrigued by Marie Antoinette's life, like me. Both Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman did an excellent job and I can't wait to watch it again.",9,0,1,6 February 2007
Moulin Rouge!," Best. Movie. Ever.
","I never knew I could love a movie as much as I do Moulin Rouge. Honestly. People like what they like, but I am tired of hearing people say stuff like, 'It's so weird.' People who have no basis for their comments sound undereducated and closed-minded. Baz Luhrmann is an excellent director because he doesn't care about making generic movies that are not memorable. You can always tell he is the director when you see one of his films and I love that about them. Nicole and Ewan and the rest of the cast are perfect in their roles, too. I absolutely love the music they picked for the movie and that makes it fun to watch. LOVE IT!",10,1,3,18 November 2006
