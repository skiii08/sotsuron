The Blair Witch Project," A severe disappointment
","I, too, saw 'The Blair Witch Project', after much anticipation- having read the many 'rave' reviews about the 'best horror film in the last twenty years'.  I cannot express the incredulity and anger I felt after the lights came up.  Not only I, but the entire audience groaned, and demanded their money back.  Now, after being a film lover for over twenty years, and taking over three buses to see a Sergei Eisentein film festival, this should tell you that I am not a casual film goer.  I did not expect, nor want to see such drivel as 'Friday the 13th', or 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'. What I did expect to see was an intelligent, psychological horror film.  Sure, I knew that this film had an ultra-low budget, and I've seen less expertly filmed movies than this before.  However, the interminable pacing- where was this tiny shred of a story going?  Add to the mix that I abhor the 'great oudoors', anyway, and still I wan't moved to the slightest bit of fright. Getting lost in the woods, or otherwise, is hardly a cinematic original.  I knew well enough not to expect bang-up 'special effects'- and I've never been a fan of them anyway.  But, the story, such as it was, went nowhere, and there was no payoff.  I didn't expect blood, guts, or gore- a superior film doesn't need them.  What I did expect, was the build-up of suspense, of dread, and the claustrophobic feeling that you can't wake up from a bad dream.  The only thing that I can say in the film's defense, was that the writers had a nice ear for dialogue- not stunningly good, mind you- just nice. But that was it- and it wasn't worth the price of a movie ticket.  I felt gypped, partially because of the 'brilliant' advertising on the Internet prior to the release of the film. What makes me angriest was that I fell for 'the next big thing', something that I always avoid.  I don't like to be told, 'see this' or 'do that'- I like to make up my own mind.  This time, I didn't , and you know, I felt just like a lemming.  Bravo to the filmmakers, who have surely finagled big, fat contracts.  The 'brilliance' was in the publicity, not the film. As a great lover of film, I was really disappointed.  I'd been rooked.  Welcome to Hollywood.",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
