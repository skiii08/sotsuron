Lucky Number Slevin," Kudos for Lucky Number Slevin
","I was very impressed with the directing/producing of this film. The soundtrack and wall paper were all part of this delightfully dark comedy featuring a large celebrity cast. Although the file does have a slightly older story line; with the new scenery, the not so serious quirky undertones and laugh-out-loud jokes it was very easily pulled off.If I had paid to see this movie, I would still feel the same....it is definitely worth the cost of a ticket and a soda.....skip the $6 popcorn and if you must have candy, purchase at a discount.And I just happened to notice Morgan Freeman is getting way to thin.",7,2,10,7 April 2006
