Casablanca," awesome
",Personally I thought this was one of the better movies that I have seen in years. The acting was incredible the characters seemed so perfectly cast in their role. Humphrey Bogart delivers his lines perfectly and smoothly. Speaking of that all of the dialogue spoken in this movie just seems as smooth as butter. The lighting throughout the whole movie was very expressive and this film to me had a perfect setting. The setting was away from the war but in it at the very same time. I went into this movie that I had never seen before with certain expectations of what it would be like. Different those expectations are but this film went above and beyond and delivered.,9,0,1,15 October 2015
Citizen Kane," 'rosebud'
",This film was absolutely incredible every time I watch a movie that is this old I am shocked to find how ahead of its time it really was. Orson Welles in this film was incredible his presence always looms throughout the whole film even though he is dead. I love how a lot of the movie involves flashbacks of Charles Foster Kane's life. The constant unknowing of his final words tends to drive you crazy throughout the whole film. And at the end when you find out what 'rosebud' means your happily contempt with what it means. The visuals in this movie are great its very transcendent of the atmosphere. But my question is how did they hear Kane say 'rosebud' when there was no one in the room with him?,9,3,4,28 October 2015
Singin' in the Rain," im singin' to see it again
",This movie was so much fun to watch it looked absolutely incredible. The color seemed so bright and so alive. If you watch it on a decent sized screen it only compliments what I said. I find it personally interesting to see Hollywood portraying and actually making fun of Hollywood. These things you see in this movie like Don and Lina being a couple for publicity. Is something that goes on in Hollywood pop culture today the movie practically predicts future Hollywood. I love how this movie doesn't take itself to seriously its just a good time from beginning to end. The dancing in this movie is awesome Gene Kelly really seems like a maverick when it comes to dancing. The camera is also cool I like how it shows how grotesque close up shots can be.,10,1,3,5 November 2015
