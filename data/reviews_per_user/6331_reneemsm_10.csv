Despicable Me 2," Better than the first!
","Generally I am not a fan of sequels. Specifically the sequels to kids movies tend to just get dumber and dumber. Definitely NOT the case with Despicable Me 2. My husband & myself (30), our 3 kids (4, 6 & 8), my parents (in their 50's) and my little sister (21) all went to see this on the 4th of July b/c our park pans were rained out. We ALL laughed from the first minute to the last. It honestly starts off hilarious and just keeps the jokes coming the whole time. Another thing I liked about this one was that there were 2 scenes that had the adults laughing hysterically, that the kids didn't quite get. It was nice that it wasn't 100% aimed at the kids, so no matter the age everyone in the theater was laughing the whole time.It was nice to see Gru as a great dad being responsible and fun, and it was nice to see him with a love interest. The girls are growing up a little so that was really cute to see and to see how Gru is reacting to that. My favorite thing about this one though, was that the Minions had such a BIG part. Half of the laughs were because of them which was great.I would HIGHLY recommend seeing this one ASAP! (Though, you could probably skip the 3D aspect).",9,1,2,7 July 2013
"I Love You, Man"," Jason Segal and Paul Rudd are a perfect match
","I normally wouldn't review a movie that wasn't just released on DVD or still in theaters, but I honestly couldn't believe there were negative reviews of this movie! How can you not like it!? In my opinion the only people who probably won't like this movie are those who are offended by cussing and sex talk (there's a lot. Less than 'The Hangover' but more than 'Something about Mary') or those who read WAAAAAY too much into things. I mean, TV and movies are not meant to be your moral compass in life. It's supposed to be funny and slightly over-the-top...it's a comedy, not a documentary. Someone was complaining that it makes men look bad? Come on. You can't be serious. I think that Peters character is a little shy in the beginning (which A LOT of men are) but Sidney brings him out of his shell and shows him how fun life can be if you let loose once in a while. Once he and Sidney meet, he really starts enjoying himself. He's kicking a** at fencing, he's 'slappin da base' again, etc. It's a definite bro movie but it's also a couples movie. I know some women who find it offensive...like my mom (which I still think is ridiculous), but I honestly can't imagine a man being so overly sensitive that they think it's anti-men. If anything, it's PRO-men. It's showing how guys need time with their friends, not just sitting at home with their girlfriends every night.Bottom line, it's quite possibly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I can watch it 100 times (and probably have lol) and it still makes me (and my husband) LMAO at the same jokes every.single.time. To me, that is how I know if something is REALLY funny. I will say that I didn't laugh very much the first time I watched it. I honestly don't know why (maybe I was in a bad mood), but the second time I watched it I had to keep pausing it so I could laugh and it's been like that ever since.Paul Rudd and Jason Segal together are a match made in heaven. All of the 'klavinisms' are beyond awkward and beyond funny. They are things that come into my head when someone says a certain word in a conversation and I just bust out laughing b/c I'm thinking of this movie. and Sidney is so hilariously, love-ably, honest, it makes me wish I had a friend just like him.",10,7,9,11 January 2011
Bridesmaids," HILARIOUS and NOT a chick flick!
","It's been called a chick flick so many times that my husband was dreading taking me to see it for my birthday. I promised him that by the end he'd tell me that he was wrong and that it was one of the funniest movies he'd ever seen and NOT just for ladies. As we walked out of the theater still laughing and quoting lines (as we did the whole 1 hr drive home) he said 'hunny, you know it hurts me to say this but...you were right'. (been waiting 10 yrs to hear that phrase lol).I honestly cannot remember a movie that we laughed so hard at. I would say the only thing that comes close would be The Hangover. There were just so many scenes where I was laughing so hard my face and stomach were hurting and tears were streaming down my face. This one is a BIG winner in our book. I'll be buying the DVD the day it comes out. Now I'm just trying to convince my husband we should go see it in the theater again next weekend lol ;-) Seriously, I cannot say enough good things about this movie. Go see it!!! You definitely wont regret it!",10,4,9,22 May 2011
Brave," We laughed, we cried, we LOVED it!!
","I took my 3 kids and my mom to see this a couple weeks ago and I keep forgetting to post a review. We all LOVED this movie SOOOOO much. It was really funny and kept the kids (and adults) laughing and entertained (except my 3 yr old son who fell asleep at the end but I blame that on the fact that we were there at nap time b/c it was the only non-3D show). There were 3 times when I got tears in my eyes and I looked over and my mom had them too. If you've ever made mistakes as a mother or a daughter it will get you too, for sure. There were a couple times that my girls (5 and 7) got scared but it wasn't nearly as bad as the Lion King (they still refuse to watch that one again). They were over it quickly after the scene was over. My mom just told them 'it's just a movie and in movies everything always ends up OK' which satisfied them). As I said, we didn't go to the 3D one b/c my kids HATE 3D movies (mostly wearing the glasses) so I can't comment on that part. Though I really wish Disney would quit making EVERY. SINGLE. MOVIE. 3D, it's getting annoying. Also the Luna cartoon in the beginning was really boring for them and there was no talking/very little music so my son laughed at something and everyone in the theater glared at him b/c it was so quiet. All in all, this was a great movie. I actually want to go back to the theater and see this one again while it's still there, so I don't have to wait for the DVD to come out. I highly recommend it!",9,3,5,14 July 2012
Hotel Transylvania," Probably not good for the 4 and younger crowd
","My husband and I took our kids to see this last night. The girls (5 and 7), my husband and I really enjoyed it and laughed throughout the whole thing. There were plenty of jokes that the kids got and there were some that went over their heads but had my husband and I laughing.My son (3) however, was not amused. He got terrified by a scene in the beginning where it looks like people are on fire and trying to kill a girl. It ruined the whole thing for him and he asked to leave about 25 times after that. As soon as the credits started rolling, he jumped out of his seat and started heading up the aisle out of the theater. And he said 'I didn't like that scary movie' over and over on the drive home. He isn't a kid that is scared of much. The only thing I can think of would be the 'scary bear' in Brave (and he wasn't scared of that nearly as much because he LOVED that movie and made us go back to the theater and see it a second time). Otherwise he's seen almost every kids movie (new and old) I can think of and hasn't been scared of any of them.Do with that information what you will. I just felt like it was something other parents might be wondering so I thought I'd share our experience.",8,0,4,13 October 2012
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Time for them to stop
","Today it was supposed to rain so my husband and I took the kids to a double feature. We saw Brave (our second time b/c it's SOOOO awesome!!!!) and Ice Age 4.Before the movie there was a Simpsons cartoon (trying to copy Pixar, I assume). It was probably the most absurd thing I've seen in awhile. First of all, clearly the person who created it was of very low intelligence because they called the daycare the Ayn Rand daycare but it ended up being really fascist in nature (scanning all the kids and having armed guards everywhere, etc). All it takes is 2 minutes of googling or reading 1 of her books (or 1 of her quotes if you're too stupid to get through a full book) to know that Ayn Rand was STRONGLY against things like that. In fact, things like that are what made her escape to America . So my husband and I were just really confused through that whole mess. Probably because we aren't morons...Then the movie started. It was fine for the kids (ours are 3, 5 and 7) esp if they like slapstick comedy stuff (as most kids do). Some things went over our kids heads but they got most of it. It was basically Pirates of the Carribbean meets 2012 (or any other apocalyptic movie). The kids laughed maybe 5-7 times and my husband and I laughed about 3-5 times. It was fine but really not worth going to the theater for it (and certainly not worth paying $5 more for 3D...which we didn't, thankfully). It honestly felt like a made for TV movie. So hopefully if they continue on with this series (Dear God I hope not) they just send it straight to TV. The first 2 were cute and funny, but the last 2...not so much.",6,2,5,15 July 2012
The Blind Side," just one thing...
","I just saw this for the first time last night (yes, we are WAY behind) and I really liked it. I think it is one of those movies that makes you examine your own life and makes you feel so incredibly lucky. I have to say that I cried A LOT. I just kept thinking about how many other kids are out there living through similar situations and how many people COULD be helping, but aren't and it all culminated into a very emotional evening for me. My only real complaint was the music. During the first football game scene I felt like the music could have been a little more upbeat and it would have been nice if it had been a song that's well-known or something. It just didn't really get me excited for the game, the way MOST football movies do. Come to think of it, the music through-out the whole movie was like that... Other than that, the movie was really great and I think everyone should see it...then go out and do something nice for someone! lol",9,0,1,17 January 2011
The Croods," MUST see it in 3D!!
","In the last 5 or so years, we've taken our kids to see a lot of 3D animation movies. None of which they really cared for (the 3D part, anyway). So usually when I ask them if they want to see something in 3D or 'regular' they choose 'regular'. Today happened to be our last day of spring break and they only had one showing of The Croods during the day...which was in 3D. So I figured we'd give it a shot and hope for the best. I am SOOOO glad we did. This is the first time that I honestly feel the 3D really added a LOT to the movie. Generally I just find it to be an annoyance (wearing the glasses and keeping the kids from touching theirs with buttery popcorn fingers) with a few 'oohs' and 'aahs' thrown in. But I honestly can't imagine seeing this any way other than in 3D (we'll probably buy it and it just won't be the same at home). There were so many times that my kids and all the ones around us were reaching out to grab things or ducking from things and I'm not gonna lie, I had to stop myself once or twice. I had never seen people react that way before other than Avatar.As far as the movie itself goes, we really enjoyed it. The plot was easy for the kids to follow and kept everyone interested. We laughed through the whole thing and were utterly mesmerized by the colors and the whole experience of this other world on the screen. The scene with the water honestly made me want to jump in through the screen with them. There were also a few times where my eyes were tearing up and I'd look over and my 8 yr old daughter was too (I like when they throw in a little sensitivity). It's a great movie for dads and daughters and I was really kind of sad that we went when my husband was at work. All 3 of my kids (4, 6 & 8) loved it and kept thanking me for taking them to see it. The only other time they were that in love with a movie was Brave. There were maybe 1 or 2 times in the movie that I felt sort of 'meh' about, but the rest of the movie more than made up for it. I'm actually kind of hoping they make a second one and that's saying something because I usually HATE sequels. All in all, I would highly recommend this movie to families looking for a fun couple of hours.",9,0,0,2 April 2013
Monsters University," Not 'laugh out loud' funny and really slow.
","I was really hoping this one would be good. Not necessarily as good as the first, but still good. But we were a little disappointed. We went the day it opened and the theater was packed with lots of kids (and some teens and adults). My kids (and many of the other kids in the theater) were getting quite bored by halfway through and asking when it was going to be over. It was weird because as an adult, I enjoyed it OK, (even though it was painfully slow at times) but it just seemed like it wasn't something that little ones could really appreciate. I liked the story and the animation was really colorful and well-done. But, a lot of the college humor was lost on them and the things that were actually funny and on their level, weren't until the last half of the film. But by that time, they'd already lost all of the kids in the theater to boredom.Another thing is, that there is absolutely nothing to be gained by seeing this in 3D. If you feel that you MUST see it in the theater, don't waste your money on the 3D ticket. After seeing The Croods (twice) and being completely blown away by the 3D (and everything else about the movie), this was a huge let down. Hopefully Despicable Me 2 will help us rebound next week.",6,0,2,2 July 2013
The Hangover Part III," Really hoping it would be funnier
","My husband and I and our friends have a tradition of going to dinner and seeing the hangover movies the weekend they are released (it also happens to always coincide with my birthday) and we've always had a blast. This time, after 3 hours and numerous pitchers of margaritas, we made our way to the theater to await our final Hangover night. We desperately wanted to be wowed. We wanted to spend the next 2 hours laughing until our faces hurt (as we had with the last 2). It just didn't happen. Now, don't get me wrong, we liked it and it was funny. It just wasn't nearly as funny as we were all hoping it would be. I was really thinking they would make the franchise go out with a bang and really 'bring it' for the last. I'm honestly not sure what went wrong though. I think they were trying to be more serious, which is fine (and again, the movie was good). But this audience wanted to be rolling in the aisle laughing. As others have said, the funniest part (by far) was the scene during the credits. Now THAT is what we wanted for this movie. Why couldn't we have skipped this 3rd one and gone straight to that one? I still think people should see it, I just want everyone to be prepared for what they're seeing.",6,0,1,26 May 2013
