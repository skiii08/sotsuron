Iron Man 3," better than Iron Man 2
","for me (a comic book reader) and all my friends (who are big fans of the marvel universe)we all really enjoyed it. Glad to see War Machine back, who I believe would of been great in the Avengers. Anyway, to the film. It was so so so funny, with the exact amount of action needed. The pace was like people said 'uneven'. But for me that only added to the twists and turns and unpredictability. It was also fab to see Stark without the suit (well for most of it)and I believe all the actors played there roles so very well. I was also surprised to see James Badge Dale perform such a harrowing role, so bloody well. Overall for me it is better than 2, maybe not as good as the original, but it has to be said they take on different routes and offer different experiences. 8.5/10 for me. Role on all the other steps of phase 2!",9,12,26,28 April 2013
