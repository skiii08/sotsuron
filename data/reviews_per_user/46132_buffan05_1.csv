The Blair Witch Project," No good
","I only rented this movie because I heard it was so scary, and everyone else had seen it. It was horrible! A complete waste of time! I was 12 and this movie had me bored to death. My brother who was 10 at the time wasn't scared! Its just plain BORING! If you haven't seen it yet, don't bother!",1,9,16,13 January 2003
