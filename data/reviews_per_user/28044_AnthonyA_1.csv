The Rock," Wonderful cast, terrific plot
","The greatest thing about this movie is the cast.  I know it's a sit on the edge of your seat, gnaw your nails to the knuckles thriller, but it's the incredible cast that makes this movie work.  And the even more incredible thing is that you could have swapped all the parts in the movie around and still have made a great movie.  William Forsythe could have played one of Ed Harris' Marines, David Morse could have played the Nick Cage part, or Sean Connery the Ed Harris role.  This cast is fabulous. And the plot is tight. Not a single misstep or illogical move in the whole thing.  Enjoy the Rock!",8,1,1,14 May 1999
