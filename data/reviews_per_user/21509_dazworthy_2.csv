Sucker Punch," Great imagery, entertaining but dark
","Those familiar with director Zack Snyder's work (The 300, Watchmen) will have some idea of what to expect from Sucker Punch. But it's certainly a film that I found full of surprises as well. Snyder creates a hyper-reality full of stunning imagery, spectacular action, and compelling characters. Baby-Doll (Emily Browning) is a girl institutionalized by her brutal stepfather after the death of her mother. Once inside the asylum she quickly retreats into a fantasy world. Within this realm she develops a plan to escape, along with new friends played by Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung. The plans involves several quests within this fantasy world to collect the tools necessary for their escape – and spectacular (and violent) action sequences ensue. Sucker Punch has been panned by many critics but I think some of the criticism is a little unfair. The opening is quite brilliant, almost like a highly artistic music video, and at that point I thought I was really in for something special. However once the movie settles into the 'quest' sequences it becomes a little repetitive (it's been compared to the levels of a video game), but I think the imagery and action dished up certainly makes up for it. I also found the finale compelling and unpredictable. I think the film will be a hit with young adults – it's a very cool film with an excellent soundtrack that will appeal as well. The performances of the five girls are all good, (although in my opinion Jena Malone is a standout), and the smaller roles are also solid. It's also quite a dark film, more so than I expected. Whilst the action is spectacular the overall tone is quite bleak, and I think this actually gives the film more substance. Whilst a normal action is film is quickly forgotten, Sucker Punch leaves you with a few emotive moments and striking images that linger with you after you've left the cinema.",Null,1,2,16 August 2011
Inception," If you only see two movies this year, see Inception twice.
","Writer/Director Christopher Nolan's follow up to the blockbuster Dark Night was always going to be highly anticipated. But with Inception he has more than delivered. In fact he has created a movie unlike any other. It combines action, drama and suspense, with intrigue, romance and it's also a bit scary in parts. But somehow it never seems overdone, which is a testament to Nolan's skill. Dom Cobb (Leonardo Di Caprio) is a master of a new form of corporate espionage called extraction – stealing people thoughts from their subconscious while they sleep. This ability has made him both sought after and a wanted man unable to go home. A powerful businessman (Ken Watanabe) offers him a job - that could wipe the slate clean and get his life back - involving inception: planting (rather than stealing) a thought in a competitor's mind while he sleeps. This is a complex film with multiple layers, and requires a fair bit of concentration. From the first seconds to the very end it bombards you with fascinating twists and turns, incredible special effects, thrilling action sequences, and thought provoking characters. With such a rich tapestry of cinema on show here, you could easily see this movie more than once. Di Caprio gives another great performance. He both suits the role and does a lot with it. Joining Cobb's adventure are his team played by Ellen Page (Juno), Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Dileep Rao, who are all great. Their characters are probably not developed as much as I would like, but in this film there simply isn't time. Tom Hardy is particularly good as the tough, cool and suave Eames. I think we will be seeing a lot more of him. And Marion Cotillard is again excellent. There's even notable actors in small parts like Michael Caine, Tom Berenger and Pete Postlethwaite, which is a nice touch. Like The Matrix or Memento, this is a movie that will be discussed and debated. It's thought-provoking, visually stunning and highly entertaining. It's been a long time since I saw a movie that left the audience gasping at the end. If you only see two movies this year, see Inception twice.",9,0,4,2 November 2010
