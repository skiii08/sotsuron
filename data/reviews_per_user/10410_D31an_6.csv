Hereditary," What a good film!
","Great story, great acting, great warnings! VERY VERY GOOD FILM! And during some moments of watching I thought it is also comedy! Pure 10 by me! It is a fantastic film and directing is awesome! I want to see Hereditary 2.",10,2,3,27 August 2018
Bird Box," This is such a great film!
","I rarely give the rate of 10 but this film definitely deserved it! Sandra Bullock proved once again that she is an immensely great actress. In addition to this, when I saw she has/plays the main role, I knew already the film is going to be great and IT IS! Her acting was marvellous and she proved yet AGAIN how great actress she is! I love her and I love this film! After three days I am still under the impression of the film! A huge 10!",10,2,5,19 March 2019
Midsommar," Some illogic...
","...Around the end of the film, Dani seems totally fine with her suddenly becoming the May Queen and it seemed that it suited her, and as an addition to all of it, she seemed not to notice something is wrong with Christian. Next, she was totally carried away by her new 'role' of being May Queen and she neglected Christian, and she was sicked and had to vomit when she saw Christian having sex with the girl Maja...? 'Xcuse me? Had Dani has been next to Christian all the time, Maja could not have had taken him! But these kind of things can only happen in a film. Overall, the film is not all that scary as is presented in the trailer. Nor was 'Hereditary'. Actually, both of the films are very similiar: if you have watched 'Hereditary', you will certainly notice the similarities. Very little blood, by the way; that is good.",6,0,3,21 November 2019
Super 8," Spielberg's films are starting to look alike.
","I was somewhat bored during watching it. Did he really need two hours for this? Anyhow, it was a cliche... I was expecting more of this film. But I guess it is how it was in his head, so who am I to argue, but I can not rate it more than 6. Sorry Steven.",6,0,1,14 February 2019
The Witch," 'Tis indeed a folk tale.
","Nothing happens for almost most of it. At the end of it, Thomasin goes to the Sabbath led by the goat named Black Philip, which is indeed a single best scene in the film I liked. The film is going somewhat slow, filled with lies, hypocrisy. It is good to be mentioned that they used You and Your, not only Thee and Thy, BUT I personally like that the dialogue is spoken in the Old English rather than in the 'New' one. The VVitch is really wrapped in the veil of mystery, suspense and soft shock. The only character who irritated me is the one of Mercy. That little 'spoilt child' really jumped on my nerves like a crazy squirrel, but – all in all – the cast is very good and the acting as well. The VVitch herself is scary enough. And it has some scenes that made me react like Ew... I rated it with a score of 8, because of the time it was set, language used, acting, actors. Very well done, Robert! Oh, but what happened to Jonas and Mercy, where did the two go, and is there really a sprequel (sequel as prequel to the story)?",8,0,2,1 June 2016
Mother!," Sick, stupid, boring.
","This is a pure waste of time. The most stupid film I have watched this year, I am sure of it. Yes, it has similarities with Rosemary's Baby, which is also a stupid film. Two hours and a minute of pure boredom. I do not know why Jennifer Lawrence accepted this role. She was the only one rational and sane in this movie. Everything else irrational and insane. I totally do NOT recommend this film for watching. Choose something else.",1,21,34,31 January 2018
