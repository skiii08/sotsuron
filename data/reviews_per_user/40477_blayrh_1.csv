Marie Antoinette," Beautiful movie
","I have just come back from the theatre and found Marie Antoinette to be a pure delight. Although I am partial to Kristen Dunst (I know some aren't fond of her) I thought she did a wonderful job in this movie. The costumes are stunning and the way Sofia has framed it is a bit of fresh air in what could have been an exceptionally dull typical historical movie. I was really looking forward to this film as I've been reading about it for over a year and I found that while it didn't exactly fit what I was expecting, it was a really enjoyable film. Try not to let your dislike of Kristin ruin this movie for you, and take it for what it is, a beautiful film. Sofia has done a lovely job whether or not it's an accurate picture of the young queen. I hope this helps! - b.",8,2,5,22 October 2006
