10 Cloverfield Lane," If you're into psychological thrillers, you will love this
","I absolutely enjoyed this one. As a person who has seen many thrillers/horrors I found 10 Cloverfield Lane refreshing and surprising. It tells the story of a young girl who gets in a car accident after fighting with her fiancÃ©. when she wakes up she finds herself locked up in a man's underground shelter, a man who later on claims the world outside is no longer what it was. during the movie, which most of it is set in one location, the viewer experiences the emotions and thoughts of the main character, collecting information with her and tried to understand what the truth really is. the main actors are great and the directing is also wonderful. it keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't let you get to one conclusion. i can understand why people didn't like the ending, since it felt like it came out of nowhere, not really adjusted to the films genre. but personally, i thought it was mind blowing. if you like mystery and are open minded, watch this.",10,1,2,30 September 2016
