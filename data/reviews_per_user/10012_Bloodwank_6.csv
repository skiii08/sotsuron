Source Code," Flawed but still pretty nifty science fiction thriller
","A man comes to on a morning train. An unfamiliar train, and he's wearing somebody else's body. Confused, he tries to get his bearings but 8 minutes later a bomb blast takes out train and everyone on it. After a strange interlude, our man is back on that same train, back where he started with a mission to save the future. Yep, this is one of those time loopy science fiction thriller joints, but for a film with such hoary gimmick its actually rather decent stuff. It has problems, but first off here are the things that really work. Jake Gyllenhaal pulls off a great turn as the confused hero, his movement from perplexity to fragmented understanding and frustration, gradually into ultimate determination is the driving force of the film above and beyond the plot and e convinces every step of the way. Michelle Monaghan is a fine love interest/foil, sweet natured and pretty with the right flashes of shock and confusion at things going down beyond her comprehension. Jeffrey Wright is similarly fine as a secretive, gently amoral scientist, whilst Vera Farmiga is fairly convincing in a slightly underwritten sympathetic military role. The other big plus to the film is its tightness and measure of real excitement. Flashy effects work is largely eschewed in favor of clock ticking suspense and physical rough and tumble, also writing is tight and the viewer is placed in the same position as the hero, without flashbacks or extraneous character detailing we find out everything alongside him as the film progresses, maintaining a fair sense of mystery and making for the odd decent twist. The tightness of the thriller structure and its execution actually lead into the films problems though. At the centre is a piece of science fiction gimmickry explained with analogies and some one six fits all quantum physics jargon. It works just about well enough to hold things together, but it doesn't stand up to scrutiny and in the end hurts the film, as the final (seemingly tacked on) sequence is rather jarring. The suspect explanation also meshes with the structure to bring down the films potential as thoughtful science fiction, it is mildly thought provoking but doesn't really go anywhere with its mind expanding possibilities, nor the moral and existential questions that arise during the course of the film. I guess one is not really supposed to question a film in this way, being that it is after all a thriller and not some piece of 'hard' science fiction, but when the potential is clearly there its hard not to be a little ticked off when it isn't realised. Still, by and large I had a fine time with this one on a basic entertainment level, I'll give it a generous 7/10.",7,0,1,22 April 2011
Citizen Kane," Truly one of the deserved classics of all time
","How to understand a legend, and the man within. Thats the enterprise that drives Citizen Kane, a mission of layers that begins and ends with Xanadu, and Rosebud. At first we get the newsreel account, facts and knowledge but its a mean rendition, notes that point but say little. And so the process begins of unwrapping mystery from memory, the search for Rosebud. Xanadu says as much as the final revelation though, stately pleasure dome never finished. Coleridge never finished Khubla Khan to his satisfaction, his committal to verse on an opium dream interrupted by a guest and left to inadequate completion, and here Xanadu is a symbol of Kane and his own quest for dream interrupted. Even as the film unwraps the man through memory and its branches, in the end understanding can only be limited, the man who resides ultimately within his own mind is only understandable to himself. Which is not to say that the film is oblique, on the contrary it is a fine, scalpel slicing dissection of a man, his rise and fall, his companions and works. Orson Welles gives a towering performance as the title role, from a young turk beaming with energy and arrogance, to crusader then to stubbornness, unerring commitment to himself above all things sowing his downfall. For all the character's flaws Welles brings sympathy and tragedy to the role, in bringing clarity and perfect nuance to every stage he conveys to the audience a deeper understanding than what is said by mere words or events and thusly provokes sympathy even when one would perhaps like to dismiss him. The cast around aid the journey well, the exasperation of George Coulouris as Kane's guardian and fluster of Erskine Sanford as a traditional newspaper owner usurped by new practice make for wry amusement in the early stages, Ruth Warrick handling with great subtlety the first shifts towards downfall as Kane's first wife, Dorothy Comingore (though histrionic in places) deeply affecting as his simple, honest and lovable second. And best of all Joseph Cotten as an old friend bearing the greatest insight and hardest fall. With such performances and finely judged writing its a classic tale of corruption, greed and the peril of relentless drive. But underneath it all the search for a man within a legend. And one of the greatest things the film does is not just highlight futility but cast doubt on the very search. Its in the cinematography, the use of light and shadow. In general terms the superb work of Gregg Toland gives the film an often shadowy mood suggesting depth even when the actors aren't at work, but whats really interesting is the refusal to give face to the journalist pursuing the story, only those he speaks to, only what is relevant to Kane himself. In shrouding the journalist and his masters particularly in shadow and dark a great gulf is established between the world of Kane and his contemporaries and those who seek to unfurl said world. If Kane's wives and companions are at a remove from him, the seekers after truth are removed even from them, impossibly far away from deeper insight. Which gives the film dual interest to me, the mind, how it seals itself off and the impossibility of knowledge. Perhaps Citizen Kane is not the best examination focused as it is on a fairly classical story, but its certainly one of the very most accomplished and entertaining. One of my favorites so far of the established canon of cinema, and hugely recommended.",10,1,2,25 September 2011
28 Weeks Later," Fun though flawed sequel schlock
","28 Days Later was, passé final block aside a near ace slice of post apocalypse horror and something of a sleeper hit, leading inevitably to a sequel. Fortunately for those of us who value some level of artistic integrity, 28 Weeks Later is pretty solid stuff and nicely ballsy, albeit to flawed to really rock out or make much more than a superficial impression. It differentiates itself from the original tale by being one of destruction rather than aftermath, in this one we have a state of order and its spectacular disruption, the horror unfolding in front of us. Regrettably it also differentiates itself with absurd contrivance, the two events unleashing horror both utterly unbelievable in the realistic context in which the film sets itself. It's all the more galling because the opening sequence gives us a bleakly realistic depiction of human frailty, total contrast to the painfully irksome generic screw ups to come. The final moments fall prey to the same problem, though I kinda give them a pass on amusement value. The biggest problem aside from this is comes in the camera work which is in a few key moments of the shaky variety. This kind of fast camera, fast cutting work only tends to be effective when used by directors with a smart feeling for the kinetic and Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, though undoubtedly talented (watch Intacto kids), doesn't really have this. He is much better at more traditional means of depicting carnage though, giving us lots of nicely shot shootings and a simply magical scene of helicopter violence that had me near cheering. A decent amount of bloodshed here and it gives the film most of its kick. The rest is provided by its mirror of mass carnage to personal trauma, it is a film given to kicking happy go lucky cliché in the teeth and all the better for it, moreover it does so in a fashion that feels organic and not just a cheesy means of the writers showing off some edge. Acting is reasonable throughout, Robert Carlyle is the standout as a devoted dad, but the lovely Rose Byrne does a decent tough but tender job and Jeremy Renner gives a likable show as a good hearted soldier. There are a couple of kids key to the affair though and neither are up to much, they aren't terrible but I can comfortably say that I wanted both to die in gruesome fashion for their role in the whole debacle, but mostly to give the adults more screen mileage. Lets face it, most child actors are horrendously unsympathetic compared to their adult counterparts and almost always less talented and this is the case here. Everything bowls along pretty nicely though, nothing made me want to eat my laptop in irritation so this one gets a OK score for the good stuff, high 6/10.",6,1,2,21 June 2011
The Hills Have Eyes," Pretty effective cheesy and gruesome fun
","Recent notable Alexandra Aja's The Hills Have Eyes begins in fairly awesome fashion, roaring out of the gates with a rather spectacular bit of murder. It may be holding to a standard slasher trope but it does it well, its a ballsy, exuberant piece of mayhem that gets things moving in just the right way. Sadly the film then sets about doing its best to undo this fine work, tiresomely moving back down the gears in its mishandled build up to its later shenanigans. The trouble is with the characters, or rather lack of them, writers Aja and Gregory Levasseur adopt the cheap shot approach to writing characters, piling up the symbols of a clichés eye view of Americana, guns, god and government, with a prominently shown American flag to drive home the impressionthat this isn't just any family we are watching but an American one writ large. The cast do well, but their roles are woven around careless emblems rather than genuine attempts to conceive worthwhile characters, as a result it appears that the makers care not for their characters, only the terrible scrapes that befall them. As a result I cared even less than I usually would, and so all the period of calm before the storm that the film takes is rather humdrum. The second half boasts some great fare though, brutal violence and bloody gore, smart pacing and generous quantities of cheese, its pretty darned silly but it works because if nothing else, Aja really knows his way around a violent set piece. He knows his way around a location as well, soaring camera and ruminating takes give the desert location a suitably desolate grandeur, while the cinematography of Maxime Sendre brings out a certain doomed and rusted out atmosphere. The Kurtzmann, Nicotero and Berger team do a fantastic job of effects as well, savage splatter rendered with grim realism is the order of the day here, as well as some effectively gnarled designs for the twisted desert dwellers. Acting wise everyone is solid, Ted Levine an effectively gruff patriarch, Aaron Stanford essays a fair badass in the films more ludicrous moments, while Kathleen Quinlan, Vinessa Shaw and Emilie de Ravin all get to run through fear, screams and brutalisation, all coming off relatively sympathetic in the process. Undoubted highlight though was Robert Joy as the liveliest and most talkative of the mutant enemy. Making good use of quirky looks under make-up his leering, grotesque enthusiasm is a pleasure to watch, skin crawling villainry that steals every scene in which he appears. Overall this is pretty decent stuff, but it never made me care. Mishandled elements in the writing, a certain smugness, various silly moments in the second half as it adopts the manner of an action film, all this brings the film down to a pure and simple level of cheesy fun. Problem is, it just isn't joyful enough for this approach to really work, so the film rather lacks in impact. Still, its quite well done stuff, a pretty good time. Reasonably recommended at least.",7,0,2,29 December 2010
Knowing," Terrible yet grotesquely endearing science fiction schlock
","Well it was touch and go for a moment there. My interest in seeing Knowing stemmed from hearing how insanely wrong headed it was, but for quite a long while I just thought it was appealingly bad. It came through though. Actually for the first hour or so I was capably entertained, sure I was cringing or laughing at it but I wasn't bored. The plot is utter bunk, a religious parable uncomfortably wrapped in apocalyptic science fiction, its themes brayed with all the grace and subtlety of a naked street preacher farting into a loudspeaker (chaos vs. determinism, science vs. faith) and their resolutions as predictable as night and day, and the gears that move it asinine (a professor cracking a code with the powers of pattern recognition and perseverance that any serious researcher knows can only come of a whiskey fuelled all nighter), but it moves at a reasonable clip and is unusual enough to intrigue. It also packs a couple of surprisingly ballsy disaster set-pieces in the first half, pretty silly but more viscerally intense than expected. So despite few of the character decisions and none of the dialogue feeling natural, and despite the screen-writers omitting to even inject contrived likability to bring the characters above absolute baseline interest, for a while I was disappointedly thinking that Knowing was just a standard bit of entertaining crap. Then meteoric, the path gets clearer, the pace more obvious and the interest starts to burn away, preparing for the ending. And boy oh boy what an ending. Two pronged, both predictable, one kinda cool and one far less so, the good stuff is kept to less than a minute and the bad is a virtual revelation. Hilariously ill conceived crypto racist lunacy with lame CGI effects work and messy symbolism, its jaw dropping stuff and well worth the wait. And it isn't just terrible but sufficiently terrible that it casts revealing light back on everything wrong with the rest of the film, even things that weren't immediately apparent. Put simply, highly satisfactory. The side benefits are Nic Cage committed as ever doing a restless nervous weirdness schtick that rather convinces, Rose Byrne being lovely as ever and some lady I never even heard of before called Nadia Townsend who appears a couple of times and is also lovely. Oh, and it generally looks good and whatnot, professionally enough made. All in all I couldn't possibly recommend this one on any genuine level, but it's definitely worth a watch for people who like really bad films. 3/10 (but a happy 3/10).",3,1,6,4 March 2012
Insidious," Decidedly underwhelming, surprisingly popular spook schlock opus
","As of writing Insidious is the most profitable film so far of 2011 and basks in the praise of genre fans. Rarely have I been so dissatisfied by a film so feted, and I'm a pretty easy guy to please. Not to mention I dig haunted house films anyway and have a lot of time for the era of schlock that Insidious taps into (that would be the blessed 80's). But somehow, from start to finish Insidious fell flat for me at almost every stage. A family find themselves the target of mysterious and menacing spooks after one son winds up in a coma after a ladder accident. From here the film moves into overdrive, serving up boo scares with loud and obvious scoring by the numbing, repetitive barrel full with a saddening minimum of actual creeps (baby monitor put to good use). The restless dead seem to have a lot of fun popping up, or out or in and props to them if they are indeed having fun as it must be pretty lame not passing on, but the constant activity combined with lack of serious threat or greater purpose (I didn't exactly expect a probing gaze into the traumatised mentality of parents post tragedy but the film is remarkably thin stuff) makes for a hollow experience lacking menace. Plus pretty much only one is designed with any flair and it gets underused. The living of the film are slightly more effective, though still flawed Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne offer sturdy performances as the leads, they never summon much in the way of drama but are never less than watchable. Barbara Hershey is fine value as a helpful mother though, and Lin Shaye makes for an endearing psychic. Things eventually build to a modestly entertaining climax in which the film finally achieves some sense of the unusual and a bit of style (though the direction is pretty dodgy) and a rather cool capper that deserved a better build up. Altogether though the film came across to me as nothing more than a haunted house fairground attraction with less verve or humour (an effect aided considerably by the occasional shrieks of my fellow cinema goers, shrieks I rather hope were intended humorously) at around an hour and a half or so an overstretched and tedious experience. I seem to be one of the few dissenters on this one so perhaps my thoughts ought to be taken with a grain of salt, but in no way do I recommend this one unless you have a stack of viewing aids and some buddies on hand to make a laugh of the watching. 4/10 from me.",4,1,11,2 May 2011
