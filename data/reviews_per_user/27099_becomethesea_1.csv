The New World," Great artistic film, bad for entertainment
","'The New World' is one of those films that you either 'get' or don't.Despite a serious lack of direction or character development (i. e. if you don't know the Pocahontas story through to her death, you'll probably be confused through at least 1/3 of the movie), not withstanding a TERRIBLE job in editing (many scenes seem literally thrown together), this movie does have its good points.The best quality, for sure, is the cinematography, which is absolutely STUNNING. If you are a fan of seeing pretty images of the moving picture, you'll be very happy with this film. The nature shots are utterly engrossing and are beautifully crafted as the backdrop of 1607 Virginia.Some events are slightly exaggerated in regards to the historical value of the film (i. e. the relationship between Smith and Pocahontas), but these inaccuracies are irrelevant to many of the other historical continuities including (but not limit to) native rituals and life.Another fair quality of this film are the actors involved. With contributions from big names as Wes Studi, David Thewlis, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale and Colin Farrell, the movie-goer should at least appreciate that there must have been -something- regarding the directors vision that was highly appealing to prompt their association with this film. Qorianka Kilcher is delightful in the role of Pocahontas--there are moments in the film when one can almost feel for themselves her inner struggles as the movie progresses. This is a good introductory role for her, and I'm eager to see how her career will develop.Overall, I give this movie 6/10 stars. It isn't wholly terrible--as a film for film's sake. If you walk into this movie with the expectation of being entertained, save your money and either wait for the discount theater or DVD release. If you walk into this movie in the mindset that you are about to witness a quintessential art-flick and maintain an open mind about the directors vision, you just might enjoy it.",6,1,4,28 January 2006
