Requiem for a Dream," Thoughts on a superb film.
","What an unrelentingly bleak story. I found it almost unwatchably sad for the last half an hour or so. Particularly the freefall of Harry's mother into a pill-induced paranoid madness..I can't recall seeing a film that I found so gut wrenchingly harsh in a very long time. Great performances, and great casting too. The Leto/Connelly combination is superb - such a physically beautiful pairing and they play the romantic lovers roles so endearingly that it makes it even harder to watch as they slide into a despairing, sordid junkie hell. I suppose what makes it so tough to watch is that the characters are inherently likable, aspiring only to simple, understandable human dreams for fulfilment. Personally I like my films to have some crumb of comfort to them, some note of optimism to cling onto - not this one, and while I'm in no hurry to watch it again, it is unquestionably a great piece of work and highly recommended. But be prepared to go through the mill when watching it..",8,0,1,23 April 2006
