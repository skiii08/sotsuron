Black Swan," Almost Porn
","This is what I posted on Facebook about the movie when I watched it in 2011.Saw 'Black Swan' last night. Hollywood really put their head in the gutter for this one. It's a cross between Mommy Dearest and Debbie Does Dallas with more sex. Don't get me wrong, Natalie Portman's acting was outstanding considering the challenges of a movie written by the Marquis De Sade's more perverted chauvinistic brother. Three 'P's'up,Pathetic,Perverted,Portrayal! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!As I said I wrote this in 2011 and feel just as strongly about it today.How this movie ever earned the awards it did just goes to show me how low our standards in entertainment have sunk.",1,4,6,27 May 2016
