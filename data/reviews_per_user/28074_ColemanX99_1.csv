The Ring," Hollywood Ruins a great Asian horror
","OK so i maybe was always going to dislike this film as i love the Asian movie Ringu on which this is based, Hollywood took all the great ideas the original film had like a great slow building plot of suspense and put them in a box far away from where they filmed this remake, Naomi Watts does her best to keep the film together and hold the audience and Daveigh Chase does an amazing job as samara but everyone else who worked on this film makes it an uphill struggle for poor Naomi and Daveigh, this was a poorly done unnecessary Hollywood remake of a great Asian movie and only gets 2 out of 10 from me because of Naomi Watts and Daveigh Chase who deserve a point each for the good job they did",1,1,5,3 September 2008
