The Devil's Advocate," Satan himself would have applauded this one.
","'Heh, heh.  Not bad.  Not bad at all.  Taylor Hackford is right.  I love watching my victims walk right into their own destruction.  Just a little nudge here, a slight distraction there and they are headed straight on the next train to hell.  Sometimes its too easy but then once in a while, there are the fun ones like Kevin Lomax and his sweet little wife.  Al was pretty convincing in my role.  If fact, it was almost like watching a home video. Andrew Neiderman must think he is a pretty smart guy for having me figured out.  I guess I will have to see him in court.'",9,1,1,10 November 1998
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," The first of many great works by Miyazaki
","'Kaze no tani no Naushika' tackles the environmental issues that we as a species, continually try to avoid.  Miyazaki paints an imaginative world of environmental disaster as a warning to stop our destructive ways.  However, Nausicaa herself is what makes this film distinct.  She is compassionate to all living things around her.  Yet she is also a fierce warrior, fighting oppressors who come to the Valley of the Wind to conquer and destroy. Nausicaa was a bold depiction of a female amidst conservative gender roles in asia.  I wonder how much of an impact this character had in changing those roles?",9,1,2,11 November 1998
