Hereditary," Weak ending
","Creepy as Hell. Some of the most intense and scary scenes I have ever seen. The tension and creepiness is palpable. Too bad that like may movies these days, they don't know how to write a fitting ending.Felt robbed at the end.",7,0,1,18 October 2018
Taken," Only Thing that gets taken is your admission $$$
","Garbage! Clich√©d, unrealistic, predictable. I just didn't buy it - just simplistic, plodding and dull - looked like a made for TV movie to me. And I LIKE these types of movies as a rule. I guess the guy next to me as we were walking out summed it up as he heard my buddy and I discussing the movie when he said 'maybe worst movie I have ever seen'.Oh, and when will movie makers get that the hand held camera thing does nothing for people except make them nauseous? Do they think that a shaky camera will make cause people to not notice that the movie sucks? Sorry - I noticed anyway! Save your money, and go see something that won't insult your intelligence.
