The Expendables 2," Such a Waste
","I'm a fan. I enjoy the mindless action movies of yesteryear. I want nothing more than to see Commando or Rambo II for the first time. I wanted to like Expendables 2, but it doesn't work.Maybe it was it too hard to ask the stars of this film to take it seriously. They didn't and it shows on the screen. The opening sequence depicts an incredible set of action scenes, each one more glorious and deadly than the last. But you wouldn't know it by the dialog. It seems like the superstar actors are having fun on the set, not like they are in a war zone. Sometimes they utter one of their trademark one-liners to make fun of their on-screen personas. Those are good for a quick laugh, but they're bad for the movie. I never like it when I hear that my favorite action movies are pointlessly violent, but that's the way I feel about Expendables 2.Take the top three movies of any one of the successful action stars in this movie, and Expendables 2 doesn't come close to any of them.",2,1,3,23 October 2013
Independence Day," What do you do if you're the president and aliens just leveled every major city in the world?
","The aliens just showed up in several giant flying saucers that measure 15 miles in diameter. The saucers each positioned themselves over a different major city in the world and simultaneously leveled them. What do you do if you're the president? Will you order a massive nuclear attack to repel the aliens?Nope, the president in Independence Day thinks that it's premature to use nuclear weapons at this point. He wants to try and take down the 15-mile floating saucers with air-to-air missiles. You try it and it didn't work. Every fighter jet is wiped out in a matter of minutes. Meanwhile the flying saucers are moving on to destroy more large cities. What do you do? You're going to order the massive nuclear attack nowright?WRONG, but the president thinks that one nuclear weapon may be used on one alien ship as long as not too many people get hurt by it. You fire and detonate a nuclear missile against one of the 15-mile saucers, but the saucer doesn't go down. One nuke didn't work. What do you do? Do you try more? How about 10, 30, or 100 nukes? What do you have to lose? No, the president thinks that it is now hopeless to use any weapons. He wants other options. At this point, one of the president's aides decides that now is a good time to inform the president that the United States is secretly in possession of alien technology in Area 51. You go to Area 51 and use the alien tech to hatch a one-time plan to disable the shields of the flying saucers. But their shields will only be down for a few minutes if this works. Now, will you please order the massive nuclear assault when the shields go down? It's our last chance. You'll do it, right?WRONG again, the president would rather try conventional weapons in this one-time effort to save the Earth. You send your last fighter jets to fire air-to-air missiles at the 15-mile flying saucer. The missiles manage to scorch the outside of the saucer, nothing more. All is lost. Hold on, one guy crashed his plane into the middle on the saucer, which caused a chain reaction that destroyed the entire ship. Waitare you kidding me? The aliens built their 15-mile wide impenetrable flying saucers with a weak point in the middle that, if touched, destroys the entire ship. That can't be right. Why would they do that? That's worse than the bad decisions the president was making. THE END.",1,6,10,16 October 2013
