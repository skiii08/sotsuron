Marie Antoinette," Pretty Pointless
","In my opinion, this movie is pretty vague. I know it's historical and all, but I mean I wasn't touched by it in any way. I find the nudity and sexual scenes completely unnecessary, and they make an already boring film incredibly stupid.In all truth, I was quite disappointed to find Kirsten Dunst naked on this movie, I used to actually admire her. Note: Used to.I watched this with my best friend, and we were hysterical at parts... not because the movie actually has any comedy, but because of the stupid things that happened. Like when, I think the second night they're in bed, and she starts hugging Louis and he just pats her hand... we couldn't get over that.It also seems historically lacking... I mean they didn't show anything about how Marie-Antoinette and Louis XIV did the decapitation and stuff, and that's supposedly what they're famous for.Also... I had a hard time believing 24-year-old Kirsten Dunst was a 14-year-old...And the scene when she supposedly breaks down... we wear hysterical from the falseness of it...So yeah, I didn't really like this movie... I find it pretty pointless... truth is I don't like movies by this director, 'Lost In Translation' was also a really bad movie...",2,2,5,14 May 2007
A Walk to Remember," An incredibly well portrayed romance and story
","I wanted to watch this movie because I'm a big fan of Switchfoot and my friend and I heard that Jon Foreman had recorded a song for it; and when I heard about the plot line, it being a romance, I knew I needed to watch it.So, we rented it a few days ago, and lemme say...wow...I just loved it to bits and pieces. I loved the fact that the main soundtrack was Switchfoot songs, and that he loved her so much he was willing to marry her even if he knew that she was going to die...which in the end she does.I cried during this movie, and so did my friend...we kinda wished it had a happier ending, but I guess you could say the ending is happy in it's own way.Don't look for plot holes, or things that seem illogical...just enjoy the movie, cus it's really one of the best movies I've seen...it's got no sexual things...a few kisses here and there maybe...but it really shows how much he loved her, and it was because of who she was...not because of the way she dressed or looked, which is just so sweet.~AngeDor√©~",10,1,2,4 December 2006
