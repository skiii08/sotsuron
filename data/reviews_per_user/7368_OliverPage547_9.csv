Ghost," Till Death Do Us Part Doesn't Have To Be The End
","'Ghost' is one of the most beautiful and heart felt films i have ever seen in my life. I love this film and i don't care who you are in at least one part of this film you will shed a tear.The Story.. Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore) are the perfect couple, they love each other, they have an apartment, life seems to be going great but one night Sam is killed while trying to fight off a mugger. Molly is having trouble coping with the memory of her late lover and is even more distraught when a simple seance con artist called Otamea Brown (Whippi Goldberg)turns up claiming that Sam has came to her to send a message to Molly that Sam wasn't randomly chosen out of the crowd by the man who tried to mug him...I love this film and it has an amazingly sad ending that touches the heart. Patrick Swayze is brilliant as Sam, he really brings out the emotions of a man who is coping with death and the after lie of watching his love deny all the signs that he is still with her.A must see film, 9 out of 10 stars.",9,4,5,28 August 2005
Brokeback Mountain," I am the queen of the rodeo...
","To be honest when i first saw this film i was really disappointed and a little bored, but once i sat down and watched it again i really saw the brilliance of it all and my heart just opened up. The end of the film is one of the most gut wrenching things i've ever seen in a film before. Jake and Heath really are convincing in the roles and i could see this happening due to the realness of the script. Ang Lee really out did himself with this movie, its beautiful yet still believable and very moving which is a mix you don't find very often in movies. So anyone who says i don't want to watch that film kits about gay guys, you should just put that thought behind you because i think this film has the potential to be loved by everybody and anybody who's truly willing to give it a chance.To me this film will become a classic and will always be up there with the likes of 'Gone With The Wind' and 'Titanic'.",10,18,20,7 July 2006
Spider-Man 3," Was a good film
","When I first got in the cinema I was expecting something truly amazing and to be honest at first i was a little disappointed because I felt that everything was happening too quickly, but then by the middle of the film everything seemed to fall into place and i began to really enjoy it.The bit when we see Peter as a different person when he has the new suit was absolutely hilarious in my opinion and made the film worth watching for that bit alone.For anyone who had any queries about having another goblin in the films, then let me reassure you, Harry was like a whole new character when he was in the suit and when he wasn't. He also surpassed the first Green Goblin in my opinion. James Franco really stepped up his game again for this film and to me he was the best actor involved.Venom was brilliant to watch although he did only have a short time on screen, however i'm not sure we've seen the last of him (and I was one of the people saying he wouldn't be back). Sandman was just as good as I was hoping and overall it was a fun film to watch.If you didn't like the first two then I doubt that you'll like this one but if you did then you'll love it because it holds all of the same characteristics that we have come to expect from a Spider-Man film.Most of the plots were closed by the end of the film and I will say this last thing. I walked out of the cinema with a smile on my face, really glad that I watched it.",7,9,15,5 May 2007
Edward Scissorhands," Beautifully made dark tale of romance and acceptance
","Edward Scissorhands is in my opinion a classic and besides Batman it's Tim Burtons greatest achievement. Johnny Depp is fantastic as Edward the the poor creation of a brilliant inventor (Vincent Price) who unfortunately dies before he is able to finish his greatest creation, thus leaving Edward with a pair of huge scissor-like hands instead of what we would call normal hands. Years then pass and one day Edward is discovered by the local Avon lady who decides to take him home to live with the family, obviously the whole neighbourhood wants to know about Edward straight away but it seems he only wants to know one person... I must say the scene where Winona Ryder is dancing in the falling snow always brings a tear to my eye, because its such a beautiful scene and it is really made perfect by Danny Elfman who manages to capture the mood with his wonderfully composed music. Edward Scissorhands is really one to watch, and so if you haven't already seen it i suggest you do.",9,1,2,22 August 2005
The Dark Knight," Best Comic book movie ever
","First off, congrats to everyone working on this film, they pulled it off. Batman Begins was exceptional, but Dark Knight managed to raise the bar to a whole new level.A huge part of this is down to the casting, Heath Ledger will be getting a lot of praise and its easy to see why, the whole time I watched it I found myself thinking how is this the same guy i saw in Knights Tale and Brokeback Mountain? He took the joker character and truly made it his own, its only sad that he can't be around to see how much people have liked what he has done.Christian Bale, Arron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, Maggie G, and Michael Cane all need to be mentioned in this too, they all gave tremendous performances that helped to enhance the story, I loved how the chemistry between Bruce and Harvey grows the closer Harvey and Rachael become. Michael Cane again shows us that Alfred isn't just the bumbling butler who just happens to know everything, he is actually contributing a lot to Batman as a character. Gary Oldman is fantastic in every role he has ever played, this is a role that could have been a little dull if played in the wrong way but he managed to keep him empathetic and interesting.The story is brilliant, The Joker isn't out for money or riches like most villains, he simply wants to change the world and almost prove to himself that people are evil. The fact that we never truly learn about why he is the way he is, just adds that level of creepiness to him that we've never seen before. Burton's Character was comedic, Nolans character is psychotic. HUGE difference.Gotham looks realer than ever, especially more so than the Schumacker disaster's, Its gritty, dark and whole. it doesn't feel like your watching backdrops or computer animated places, its all real.The fact that Scarecrow makes a return appearance helps to connect the films together, only other films i've seen this done in are superman (Lex) and XMEN (Magneto) but they didn't really have much choice.Twoface looks scary and you can understand why he is so pi***d! Nothing in this film happens by chance everything fulls into place, the equipment he uses and vehicles aren't just there magically like other adaptations.And yes someone does take up on that whole 'but surely someone will know its him, look at all the resources and money he has'. Waited a long time for someone to look at that.Anyway back to the point, this film has met all expectations, it has exceeded its original which puts it into a small group in my opinion, it sets up for a third film and leaves us wanting more. if you haven't seen it, do, if your not a fan of the other Batman films, it doesn't matter. The character has come along way from using that shark repellent spray to get rid of a great white hanging off his leg or wearing costumes with rubber nipples attached, he is 3 dimensional and diverse. the plot is intriguing and the characters all shine, nobody can deny that this film is nothing short of a masterpiece and will truly stand the test of time.",10,2,6,22 July 2008
The Fly," Wow
",Practically the best remake of all time. Vincent Price's movie was good but this one adds another level to it. Jeff Goldblum is wonderful as Seth Brundle/ Brundlefly he really shows the true madness of the character while allowing the emotional content to shine through the gaps.This film is beautiful and even though the basic genre is horror this film plays out one of the greatest love stories played out in film history.In short 'The Fly' is well worth taking the time to sit down and watch be it now or in ten years this film will always be a classic.,10,1,2,23 May 2006
The Wrestler," Rocky/ Rocky 2 for wrestling fans
","First off, I thought it was great film, good acting, poetic writing and a realistic overall feeling.The wrestling, like in Rocky is only the backdrop for the story which is more about Randy The Ram (Rourke)trying to make an honest wage and re build his fragile relationship with his daughter. The real world for Randy is represented in the human form of Pam (Tomei) who's life seems to be taking a similar path to the Ram.If you are looking for a happy feel good movie about the glamorous world of professional wrestling then this film is definitely not for you. It shows the reality of what its like before and after your on top and just how hard life can be. Its a tragic drama that touches on the themes of passion and regret.And yes its true what they say Micky Rourke is amazing in this role. His scene's with his daughter seem very genuine and heartfelt.",9,1,3,29 December 2008
Iron Man," Good comic movie
","firstly it does in fact live up to a lot of the hype thrown at it. The first half of the film is a little slow but gives us a fairly good insight into the character of Tony Stark.Once we see Iron Man hit the screen its what most fan boys would have wished for, he doesn't look silly. In fact the CGI is pretty damn amazing.The second half of the film is a lot faster and more entertaining.The dialogue is funny and sums up a lot of the characters, there were a few set ups for a sequel which apparently is in the works already. There were some great comic references including the usual cameo by Stan Lee.Robert Downy Jr is amazing as Tony stark, surprised me a little but in a good way, he really fit the role well and showed what I know of Iron Man pretty close to the comics.Also I will say the ending was a little bit of a shock and instantly made me want to watch the second when they make it, best ending of any comic movie, except maybe Batman Begins.Definitely recommend it, they have made a fun film for not only comic fans but normal cinema goers, will be a big hit.",8,0,2,3 May 2008
Fantastic Four," Give it a chance
","First of all, this is a pretty good adaptation of the comic, i feel that they did most of the characters justice. the thing and human torch feud is well played and adds a lot of humour to the film.Something to consider for people who think that it spends too much time setting things up- they have to show how 5 separate characters gain and react to their powers. (nothing like x-men so don't compare).The story is a little average but what do you expect from a film aimed at children as well as adults? but seriously, fans of the comics should appreciate this title and kids will love it regardless and believe me its a lot better than the rubbish that they made in 94.",7,2,3,14 April 2008
