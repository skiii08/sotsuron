Marie Antoinette," Brilliant
","I was a bit apprehensive to go see a movie about 18th century France mixed in with some cool hip tunes from the 80's. But this is Sofia Coppola and as expected, she does a magnificent job. It's not a historical movie in the strict sense. You won't learn much about the french revolution or the social context of the times, apart from the fact that the french royalty lived in complete luxury at Versailles. But Marie Antoinette is a very captivating movie about the personal story of this Austrian girl who ends up marrying the heir to the french throne. The images and costumes are simply beautiful. The pace is slow like in Sofia Coppola's previous movies but it's what makes her movies so special. The music is awesome and the acting very good. I just love this movie. Two thumbs way up !!!!",9,51,100,25 May 2006
The Village," A reflexion on today's America
","I have just seen the movie which I thoroughly enjoyed from beginning to end. I have been pondering on the numerous ideas raised by the movie and have spent much time reading reviews on the IMDb board. Seeing how diverse and passionate the overall reactions to the movie are, I realized that M. Night Shyamalan fully succeeded in his enterprise. **** SPOILERS ****Many people walked into the movie theater expecting a scary movie dealing with the supernatural. Instead the movie deals with modern society, the fear of others, making up lies, keeping secrets ..... and the temptation to create a utopian society secluded and isolated from the rest of the world.I am not surprised that most American viewers did not react favorably to the movie. 'The village' is a metaphor of today's America dealing with its fears of terrorism and immigration. Shyamalan was inspired by the events of 9/11 when he wrote the scenario (something he talks about openly in Europe but keeps somewhat quiet in the US). The terrible things that each family in the village experienced in the past are symbolic of the trauma experienced by the attacks on the towers. Thus, the temptation to make up new fears (Iraq), manipulate people and build a wall around yourself ..... Lies, deception and secrets ....... Sound familiar ?Yes, this is not your summer blockbuster movie. It's reflective movie which makes you think. Each person makes up his own opinion about the motivations of the elders in the village. Whether or not they are good people or completely clueless. Yes, the outside world can be scary and reality harsh to deal with.... So how the does world cope ??? How do you make things better ????The movie does not provide answers but has the merit to make people react. Just like people are deeply divided on Bush and Iraq, people will be deeply divided on this movie.",10,0,0,20 August 2004
