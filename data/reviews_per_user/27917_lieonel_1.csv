Iron Man 3," Just Making Money, Lame Movie
","Without a doubt this was the least favorite of the three for me. I can't go into detail without spoilers, suffice it to say you are better off watching The Avengers repeatedly, it was a big let down for me as I have been collecting comics for over 40 years. The character of Ironman has gone in a direction which made no sense, the bad guy was a total let down on many levels, you will know what I mean when you see it, because I know you will lol. I there are so many story lines and bad guys to choose from and they came up with this plot. Sadly I will have to wait for the next Thor or Captain America movie to get my fix. So enjoy your popcorn and try to enjoy the movie.",3,0,1,24 September 2013
