The Blair Witch Project," Good, not great. Don't believe the hype.
","The Blair Witch Project - ***In October of 1994, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams hiked into Maryland's Black Hills Forest to shoot a documentary about a local legend, 'The Blair Witch.'  They vanished, never to be heard from again.  One year later, their footage was found.  It records the filmmakers' frightening five-day journey into the woods and captures the events that led up to their disappearance.The Blair Witch Project was unveiled to the world at the Sundance Film Festival, where it generated tremendous buzz.  Glowing word of mouth has followed the picture ever since.  Critical quotes such as 'Scary as hell' and 'The scariest film since the Exorcist' have been splashed across newspaper and television ads.  Audience interest is so high that the two screens in Washington, DC which run the film sell out days in advance. Given all of this hype, my disappointment in the movie was inevitable.  If you walk into the theater expecting the scariest experience of your life, chances are you will be let down.  However, I suspect that if I had walked into the movie cold, with no expectations and no knowledge of the hype or the reception in Park City, I would have been pleasantly surprised.To be clear, The Blair Witch Project is not a true documentary.  The three people we follow are portraying themselves, and the Maryland locations are authentic.  But the actions are staged (as are the fates of the characters.) Unlike Drop Dead Gorgeous (another mockumentary), this one is so believable, so successful in its authenticity, that many people are fooled into thinking it is real.  Directors Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick shoot only in 16mm and High-8, the film stocks available to the three lead characters.  While this crudity of form sometimes impinges on the viewer's ability to discern what is happening (what IS that wrapped in the cloth!?!), it is essential in establishing the documentary's authenticity.  Indeed, the unclear sound and the limited night vision only add to the movie's bag of scary tricks.  The Blair Witch Project, with its low budget and documentary feel, relies upon implied menace to scare its audience.  It does not use CGI or state of the art make-up effects.  It uses piles of rocks and twigs bound together.  (I'm not kidding.)  I rather enjoyed this new slant on terror, and admired the ingenuity employed to actually make piles of rocks menacing.The film possesses a certain streak of artfulness not typically found in a Hollywood horror movie.  I was particularly intrigued by an implied theme about moviemaking in general: It must be lived to be authentic.  Three students set out to film a movie about a scary legend.  But when they get lost in the woods, they forget about shooting their planned documentary and instead shoot 'behind the scenes' footage of the trio's quest for civilization.  Only when they deviate from the script and abandon any pretense of being outsiders or observers do they REALLY document the power of the Blair Witch legend.  In essence, they must become a part of the story in order to capture the story.  The entire form of the film, a mock documentary, serves to emphasize this principle.Is it scary?  Yeah, sure.  It is scary in the same way that most horror films are scary - some guy is walking backwards through the dark and you just know he is going to get an ice pick in the eye.  But it is not bone-chilling terrifying, like The Exorcist or The Shining.  Quite to the contrary, the first two thirds of the movie is quite funny as it traces our filmmaker's journey through Burkittsville while interviewing the locals. Only in the final act does the tension really take hold.  Even then, it does not reach its stride until the final sequence, when our intrepid filmmakers stumble upon that house...",Null,0,0,9 August 1999
American Pie," Some will love it, some hate it. Just like high school.
","American Pie - ***This film tells the story of four male high school friends in Michigan who enter into a pact with each other to lose their virginity by prom night. Jim (Jason Biggs) is an average kid who finds himself tongue-tied whenever he attempts to speak to a beautiful classmate like Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth,) a foreign exchange student.  Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) has already gotten to third base with his longtime sweetheart Vicky (Tara Reid,) but he cannot figure out how to... steal home.  Oz (Chris Klein) is a Lacrosse jock who joins the choir in order to meet chicks.  There he meets Heather (Mena Suvari,) who becomes his duet partner.  Finally there is Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas.)  A true outsider at the school, Finch supplies his friends with homework assignments and refuses to use public restrooms. During the weeks preceding prom night, the guys pursue various romantic entanglements.  Sometimes they find enlightenment, sometimes they find humiliation, but mostly they find humor.When American Pie arrived in theaters, it was already cloaked in controversy.  Here is a mass market comedy, geared toward teens, which barely escapes the dreaded NC-17.  The film is so raunchy that it has been dubbed 'There's Something About Pastry.'  Consider the tag line on the poster:  'There's Something About Your First Piece.'  Is the movie too raunchy?  No - but it pushes the envelope.  There are three scenes in particular which will probably achieve a certain infamy.  Let us quickly dispense with them so we can move on to the rest of the film.  (1) The opening scene, in which Jim finds a unique use for a tube sock.  (2) The party scene, where Stifler (Seann W. Scott) takes a drink of beer only to find that it is laced with a certain bodily secretion that was taboo in the mainstream cinema until 1998.  (3) The scene in which Jim has intimate relations with an apple pie.  Yes, the aforementioned scenes are crass, but are they funny?  Jim's scenes are, because they both end in his being caught by his father.  And they both reinforce the awkwardness and desperation of the teenage male.  Stifler's scene, however, is merely gratuitous.Perhaps the most surprising thing about American Pie is its warm-hearted center.  Unlike Porky's or any of the other alleged 'sex comedies' of the 80s, American Pie gives all of its characters, both male and female, well-rounded personalities.  Of course the guys are interested in sex. But they're also supportive friends to each other, and they're interest in women is multi-dimensional.  Oz, for instance, finds that he falls in love with Heather.  What started out as a crass conquest turns into a rather sweet romance.  The picture is also quite funny at times.  I particularly liked the scenes between Jim and his father (Eugene Levy.)  Another blockbuster scene is the one in which Jim performs a striptease for Nadia.  What Jim does not know is that his performance is being beamed across the internet. American Pie is also successful in the way it presents us with the standard teenage stereotypes (jock, nerd, choir girl, band girl, etc.) and then proceeds to tear them down and show us that all of these characters have other dimensions.Alas, the film sometimes gets in its own way.  The direction, by Paul Weitz, is rather rudimentary, even clumsy at times.  The truly romantic moments are undermined by dreary, by-the-numbers musical interludes.  Finally, I felt that the film sometimes reveled too much in the humiliation of its characters.  Granted, humiliation is a part of life in high school.  That is why I liked Jim's sexual encounters with Nadia, the sock, and the pie; while Jim was humiliated, his father would painfully try to explain that 'it's perfectly natural.'  But I felt the movie crossed the line when Stifler slipped Finch a laxative, leading to an embarrassing encounter in the women's restroom.  This served absolutely no dramatic purpose.  Likewise, the character of Sherman (Chris Owen) achieves total public embarrassment at the conclusion of the picture.  Dramatically it is meant to be Sherman's comeuppance, but I felt that it was too harsh - even for him.",Null,0,0,9 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A worthy addition to the Kubrick legacy.
","Eyes Wide Shut - ***1/2Director Stanley Kubrick's final film is a probing, thoughtful, occasionally baffling exploration of  relationships.Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) are smoking pot one night, after a party during which both spouses flirted with others, when Alice reveals that she once had thoughts of cheating on her husband.  She did not act on the impulse, she explains, but she considered giving up her marriage and her daughter to pursue a mysterious Naval officer.  Dr. Bill is startled by this, but finds himself summoned to a house call before he is able to respond to the revelation.  That night Bill finds himself caught up in a series of increasingly bizarre circumstances. 1) A grieving woman makes a pass at Bill right beside her father's deathbed (literally.)  2) Bill is accosted by a gang of young hooligans, 3) He is propositioned by a prostitute named Domino (Vanessa Shaw.)  He goes back to her place, but a phone call from the wife dampens the mood.  4) Bill meets up with an old friend named Nick Nightingale (Todd Field.)  Nick is a struggling piano player who explains that he has a gig later that night at, well. an orgy.  It seems that Nick plays blindfolded.  5) Bill memorizes the password needed for admittance to the orgy and quickly sets out to acquire the prerequisite attire (tuxedo, cloak, and mask.)  Apparently he is after a little revenge nookie.  6) Bill visits the Rainbow costume store in the middle of the night and encounters Milich (Rade Sherbedgia,) the eccentric owner, and his daughter (Leelee Sobieski.)  7) Finally, Bill arrives at the big 'party.'  I will not spoil the rest of the film.  Let me say simply that Bill's covert presence at the orgy is uncovered, and he finds himself afraid for his own life as well as the lives of others.  The final third of the film chronicles Bill's search for answers:  Who are these people?  What happened to that mysterious woman?  Where is Nick Nightingale?Eyes Wide Shut has Stanley Kubrick's fingerprints all over it.  All of his signature traits are here:  The pregnant pauses, the dramatic silences, the somber music, the stillness of the camera, and - most of all - the cold detachment.  It is highly Kubrickian (to coin a phrase) in its refusal to editorialize.  What is the point?  What is this film about?  Kubrick never tells us.  He simply presents us with the facts and lets us draw our own conclusions.  As a result, every viewer comes away with a  different message, because every viewer goes in with a different frame of reference.Much has been made of the technical production of this film.  Yes, it is true that Harvey Keitel and Jennifer Jason Leigh were cut from the movie and recast.  Yes, it is true that Stanley Kubrick filmed numerous takes - sometimes more than 100.  Yes, the shoot lasted for several years.  Yes, it was filmed entirely in London, even though it is set in New York City. And yes, some of the cloaked figures in the orgy scene were digitally inserted to cover strategic areas and thereby earn an R rating - as opposed to an NC-17.  But none of this matters.  What matters is what ended up on the screen.  And what ended up on the screen is an artful, insightful, and mysterious film.",8,0,0,9 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," A triumph of style and substance.
","The Sixth Sense		-	***Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a gifted child psychologist down on his luck following the tragic suicide of a former patient.  Dispirited, the good doctor finds himself burnt out and emotionally distant from his wife Anna (Olivia Williams.)  Then along comes young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment,) an eight-year-old boy clearly struggling with inner demons.  Cole's mother Lynn (Toni Collette) is having difficulty enough raising the boy on her own.  It does not help that the child is shy, sullen, and prone to sudden fits of unexplained panic.  Grasping for redemption, Dr. Crowe treats the troubled lad, eventually befriending him.  For only when Crowe earns Cole's trust can the boy fully explain his secret.  It would be wrong of me to divulge anything further.  The rest of the movie's secrets I shall leave for you to discover.The Sixth Sense is a triumph of tone and ambiance.  It manages to startle us, to make us grab the forearm of the person at our side, and to gasp at strategic moments.  With the aid of cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (The Silence of the Lambs), director M. Night Shyamalan infuses every shot with dread and foreboding.  In short, it is a highly successful thriller.  Yet its most impressive accomplishment is that it does not skimp on drama.  The movie is populated with three-dimensional characters that behave in real and honest ways.  Take Toni Collette as the boy's mother.  In a standard thriller, this character would be a throw-away, serving no purpose other than to complain to her son and disbelieve him at crucial points.  But in The Sixth Sense, the mother is a concerned parent who is struggling to put food on the table and maintain her own sanity, much less the sanity of her son.  She is a living, breathing person with strengths and weaknesses.  As a result, we empathize with her.  The same holds true for all of the supporting players, including the Doctor's neglected wife.The heart of the movie lies is the burgeoning friendship between Willis and Osment.  It works wonderfully, thanks in large part to Osment's outstanding performance.  Not since Radio Flyer and E.T. have I been so impressed with a young actor's abilities.  When the boy is in the throes of a panic attack, you feel it.  When he warily backs away from Dr. Crowe during their first meeting, you feel his hesitation as if it were your own.  By his own standards, Bruce Willis turns in a relatively strong performance.  It may lack the emotion of In Country and the flair of Death Becomes Her, but it is certainly two notches above his typical action work, such as his role in Striking Distance.  One element that I found lacking for much of the film was the relationship between Crowe and his wife.  Their estrangement seemed arbitrary, more a result of screenwriting necessity than of real life problems.  By the picture's conclusion, however, this plot line was sewn up nicely.The film has a unique conclusion, which will have viewers discussing it in the lobby, in the car on the way home, and around the water cooler the next day.  Some will love the ending.  Most will be surprised by it, but some will not.  I have mixed feelings in that while I found the final revelation to be intriguing, I wonder if it throws off the movie's delicate balance, sending it into standard thriller territory.   The conclusion is not gimmicky, yet it is startling.  The Sixth Sense is such a sincere and honest film that I question whether it needed that final twist.  Oh, and I also saw it coming from a mile away.",Null,0,0,27 August 1999
