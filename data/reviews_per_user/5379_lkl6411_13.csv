Walk the Line," First rate acting in a first rate film
","I knew very little about Johnny Cash before seeing this movie but I'm really glad I invested the time to see it.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do a great job portraying these complicated, talented artists and their relationship from the early days of their careers. Joaquin had a tougher role but he came through beautifully in expressing the angst and struggle in JC's life.The actors did a very credible job singing and the drama around their relationship was interesting and poignant.JC was a brilliant songwriter and singer who took some wrong paths on his road to fame and somehow lived to tell about it. The glimpses of his past give us an indication of where his dark side came from and yet he never gives up.I really enjoyed this movie and I think you will too!",9,0,1,26 November 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Outstanding acting but not an epic movie
","Any movie that keeps a consistent 8.0 or above score on IMDb must be outstanding, right? I hesitated to see Brokeback Mountain because I'm not into same-sex relationships, but I'd heard the acting was superb and the cinematography beautiful. I wasn't disappointed with either of those 2 aspects of the movie. All of the actors did a fantastic job portraying their characters. And, to my surprise, it was the heterosexual sex scenes that left me wondering why they included what they did (bare breasts on both female actresses-totally unnecessary in this movie) The homosexual scenes were treated with delicacy and discretion in my opinion.The movie made you think and yes, it did make me tear up in 2 spots. Love is love, I guess.I wish things had ended differently and the characters hadn't lived such tortured lives. But that's up to the writer! This movie wasn't a 'life-changer' or one I 'won't be able to get out of my mind' as some reviewers felt. It had poignant moments but it wasn't quite 'epic'. I do hope Heath Ledger wins some awards. Jake Gyllenhal deserves recognition too. Brave men to take on these roles.",7,4,12,16 January 2006
Knocked Up," A big disappointment
","Based on the ratings, I thought I'd find this movie hilarious. My husband and I went hoping for the best and were sorely disappointed.The movie had maybe 5 funny parts. I guess if you enjoy watching people 1)smoke pot (with all kinds of instruments), 2)watch movies with nudity, 3)simulate sex fully clothed and 4)fake laughter you will love this movie.My husband & I both thought it dragged, was mostly stupid and implausible. For example, a character supposedly has -0- recollection of the night before but then recounts something specific that happened later in the movie. The main woman character has this successful career but ends up helping her clueless boyfriend keep track of the nudity in movies. Silly, stupid.The acting was decent except for the main guy character - I hate his laugh and it's constant throughout the movie.The only redeeming scene for me was the birth which was moving. Other than that, this was a waste of 2 hours.",2,1,5,9 June 2007
Dreamgirls," Solid movie experience
","I had seen Dreamgirls on Broadway many years ago so I looked forward to seeing the movie when it came out.I wasn't disappointed in the least. The movie allowed character development to occur with greater depth and the performances were really superb.Yes, Jennifer Hudson as Effie and Eddie Murphy as Jimmy are the scene- stealers. But all of the performances are very strong - not a weak character among them.One thing that has annoyed me when reading critics' or moviegoer reviews. Beyonce' is described as being unimpressive or having a 'flat' performance. This is exactly as it should be. She's showing great acting ability by not coming across as the star she truly is. Rather, she is playing to character - a doormat for her manager's vision who gradually comes into her own. I thought she was pretty terrific.Overall, a really good movie that I look forward to seeing again when it comes out on DVD.The music is fantastic!",9,2,6,29 December 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Profound & Unforgettable
","My husband and I see a lot of movies and usually spend the drive home talking about what we thought. That's about all the discussion or thought we give to most of the movies we see. Not the case with Million Dollar Baby. I've had a hard time getting this one off of my mind. I went to sleep thinking about it, woke up thinking about it, and have recalled its emotions many times today.I knew the movie was about an upcoming woman boxer and in fact it started out like an underdog 'Rocky'-type flick. Character development was perfection - you learned enough of the background to understand why each character became the person they were, but much was left unrevealed- some of which I'm still wondering about today.The deep emotions of joy, triumph, & overcoming your past were balanced with enough sadness to be moved to tears. And questions were raised that are truly NOT black and white, regardless of your religious or ethical beliefs.This movie left me sadder than most movies I've ever seen. I was moved in a way few movies have impacted me.It's not a 'feel good' movie, but it is a movie that will make you feel. Go and experience Million Dollar Baby. Go on a day you can handle some pain and sadness. It is worth your time & tears and you will be rewarded with outstanding performances from an amazing cast.",10,3,6,3 March 2005
Blood Diamond," Gripping, Provocative Movie
","My husband picked the movie tonight and I wasn't terribly enthusiastic about Blood Diamond from seeing the trailer. I was wrong.The movie went by very quickly because it was well written, beautifully acted, and suspenseful.I'm not a die-hard Leo D. fan, but I thought his performance was incredible. In fact, the entire cast was excellent.It was hard to watch some of the scenes, especially involving young people, but it did expose some things I was unaware of in the diamond industry & in Africa in general.I was moved, outraged and enlightened. Will I buy a diamond again knowing what I know now? I highly doubt it.See this movie!",9,1,2,4 January 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Great, Romantic movie!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of Pride & Prejudice. I went to the movie not having read the book for over 20 years, but hoping I would enjoy the plot line and characters nonetheless. I was not the least bit disappointed.The filming was beautifully done, from the first few scenes when Lizzy is walking back to her home. The scenery is lovely and the disparity between the rich and poor is conveyed clearly by the stature of their homes & yards. The music is lovely, the acting is superb, the interactions & conflicts between Darcy and Lizzie memorable. All in all, it's a wonderful story and a joy to sit through. Like many others, I wish the movie had been longer if only to prolong the feeling you're left with as the movie culminates.If you like period romances like 'Emma' 'Sense & Sensibility' 'Shakespeare in Love' 'Ever After' & 'Little Women', you're sure to enjoy 'Pride and Prejudice'.And, by the way, the pig scene is so innocuous I have no idea why so much has been made of it... Ridiculous!",10,2,4,10 December 2005
Taken," Great action movie
","My husband and I saw this movie tonight - very enjoyable! Fast-paced, action-packed, somewhat violent, but you cheer Liam Neeson on as he takes on all the bad guys.Liam Neeson is perfect in his role. The daughter is also great. The ex-wife very unlovable!This movie takes you into the seedy side of an international problem that is unspeakably sad. Like the Bourne movies, Neeson dodges every bullet but it's an exciting movie and 90+ minutes goes by unbelievably fast.We really liked this movie and were glad we saw it!",8,0,0,12 February 2009
The Holiday," Thoroughly Enjoyable Romantic Comedy
","I had read some negative reviews on IMDb so I went to see this movie half expecting to be bored and disappointed. I was pleasantly surprised to experience a movie that was funny, poignant & had interesting characters and plot lines.My husband felt the movie was dragging a little at the beginning but I didn't think so. I do think it qualifies as more of a 'chick flick' but I found it to be terrific.I would be happy to see it again in the theater and will definitely own it when it comes out on DVD.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",9,5,12,15 December 2006
Wedding Crashers," Pretty lousy movie
","I've always been able to trust other viewers' opinions on this site and have used the scores to decide whether to see a movie in the theatre or wait until it came out on DVD. Until now.My husband and I went to see Wedding Crashers today and it was really disappointing. Cheap nudity, cheesy scenes and a length that dragged between laughs made us wish we had gone to see something else. The acting is okay (although I wouldn't have believed Jane Seymour would lower herself to this film's level) and some of the bantering is snappy and funny, but it doesn't save the movie. There are some funny parts, but overall a disappointing choice to see this movie.",3,9,19,31 July 2005
The Blind Side," Wonderful Movie
","I can't think of anything wrong with The Blind Side that warrants comment.This movie made my 18 year old daughter and I laugh many times. It was also poignant to see the life Michael Oher came from - and how both he and his new family were transformed in their relationships.I heartily recommend this movie to those with an open heart, a desire to laugh, and to really see how things can absolutely change when we give of ourselves to others.A feel-good movie based on a true story- something we all need these days! Blessings to Michael and the Tuohy family!",9,5,10,27 November 2009
Up in the Air," A really decent movie
","My husband, brother-in-law and I saw this movie today.We all agreed that Clooney was great in this role. The supporting cast was also very solid.The plot was at times very sad and other times very funny.Other reviewers who said they didn't feel anything about any of the characters must not feel very deeply.Overall, the three of us were glad we saw this movie even if it didn't have the ending any of us anticipated.Be sure to see this; if not in the theatre, then as a rental.To me, it was worth the viewing time and I'm still thinking about some of the characters and outcomes in the movie hours later.",7,0,4,2 January 2010
Atonement," Boring & crass
","I haven't read this book but I went to the movie hoping it would live up to its IMDb rating and critics' reviews. It didn't! I found it very long and slow in parts and it took some time to get over the use of vulgarity in the early 'letter' scene - I was there with two younger (18, 24) nieces and didn't find this to be a pleasant scene. In fact, I was mortified. Some people left the audience after this and the library scene.While the cinematography was beautiful in parts, there remain aspects of the movie I have yet to understand: The French soldier speaking to Briony in the hospital, the beach scene with the soldiers, and others. I just don't understand how they contributed to the movie except to add to its length. It was gory in the hospital scenes, too.Overall, I wish I hadn't wasted my time seeing this movie. It left me with bad feelings, overall.",2,10,20,29 December 2007
