The Sound of Music," wonderful musical though it took me many years to realise this
","I saw the stage version when it was first in London and was disappointed - I felt it wasn't up to the standard of earlier R&H shows. The story was quite good, but the songs disappointed me. When it was out on celluloid, I wasn't interested enough to see it and I really had no interest in Julie Andrews and knew nothing of Christopher Plummer. I just said 'it's the worst R&H show I've seen, I can't be bothered with the movie.'It took until recently when I saw a DVD of it going very very cheap in a supermarket that I thought, well, my husband likes this movie, might as well add it to the collection - and of course we have visited Salzburg a number of times when staying in that area of Europe so it'd be good to see the city again. I expect I can sit through it OK....Instead I was entranced. It's wonderful, Julie Andrews was perfect and Christopher Plummer simply divine. To think I've missed out all these years. Unmissable.",10,5,14,9 October 2009
Crash," This movie is well worth its Oscar
","Spoilers throughout Most of the time this movie doesn't make pleasant watching. We are faced with a collection of racists interacting with a few people who aren't racists - but even then, those who are may discover their error and those who aren't may discover they just didn't know themselves.I'd expected a major car crash scene. It's not exactly like that. The crashes are between people who in the past have been 'apart' but sometimes come together. What sort of crashes, I'll leave you to find out.I watched this movie as Sandra Bullock stars - I didn't really know any of the other actors. I would say, any reason that gets you watching this telling social drama is a good reason. The racism is truly shocking - is it really this bad in the USA? Aren't there any penalties for insulting - or worse - people in this way? It's racism against all colours, and I expect all creeds too if there'd been time to go into creeds. The white lady unable to trust black people yet discovering it's a black person who'll help her in an emergency whilst everyone else including her husband can't be bothered or can't be reached, her husband probably carrying on with his black PA, the cop who thinks he's decent but racism can even get him, the cop who's definitely racist and yet will save anyone's life. The coloured man who's insulted by the cop sexually abusing his wife, and daren't answer back, and her fury at his cowardice - or was it just common sense? The cop who's forced to tell lies and make himself seem a fool because the police department don't want a race scandal. The DA embarrassed people will find out he was carjacked by 'black guys' and trying to find a publicity fiddle to keep this secret. The shopkeeper insulted by being labelled with the 'wrong' ethnic origin and the usual insurance small print that denies him compensation and then driven to desperate measures. The people trafficking. Guns here there and everywhere, easy to get, easy to use, shoot first, think later. I mean, it's got almost everything neatly fitted into this movie, hasn't it! And some clever twists - either sad or heartwarming to liven the mood when you are just thinking how horribly grim life apparently must be in LA.Don't miss it!",10,1,6,22 October 2009
Knocked Up," Immensely better than I expected from the write-up - intelligent and entertaining
","I thought this might be 'watchable' if I had nothing else to do so I recorded it. But right from the start, I found myself intrigued because the actors are all so good. It's not a case of 'Wow, aren't they gorgeous guys and girls,' but 'What an intelligent story this is.' Idler Hero and responsible-job heroine have a drunken one-night stand much of which they don't remember and heroine ends up pregnant. But the tables turn when the idler decides he must be a proper dad. The story comes and goes quite a bit as we go through the pregnancy and the couple are sometimes together, sometimes apart, as each is insecure with the other and the heroine isn't at all sure a future with this guy is the right answer. The hero gradually becomes more and more responsible, taking charge. The heroine learns to ask for help and support. Problems of pregnancy aren't glossed over and hero proves he is going to be a great husband and a great dad from a rather unpromising start. The final part of the movie is really delightful as hero and heroine, currently living apart, are both preparing for the birth in their separate premises now that the hero has bought his own place after years of squatting with friends. All you need to know after the birth is which home will they live in! I never went, Oh this is amazing, it isn't the kind of movie I'd rave about, but I couldn't stop watching and enjoying seeing two people become mature and learn to love each other. A child may be divisive but not in this case, it makes these two people grow up.",8,0,0,1 October 2010
Bridget Jones's Diary," So-so movie though would have failed without Hugh Grant
","This is entertaining enough to watch once and perhaps even twice - because Hugh Grant is so good in it.]Anything Hugh Grant is in is worth watching in my experience, whether he's sending himself up farcically, which he does so well, or acting a serious part as in The Man who went up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain. HG is a real charmer. Even playing the caddish Wickham part in this Jane Austen sort of take-off, Grant manages to make Wickham likable in spite of being equally caddish! I used to read the original B.Jones column in the Independent. It was fairly entertaining although eventually I got tired of her endless problems and moans and stopped reading it - it went way past its sell-by date, I felt. The movie isn't nearly as good as the column, mainly because Zellwegger is so badly miscast althuogh the actress clearly does do her very best. I just can't imagine Bridget Jones like Zellweger, nor does she as scriped and acted have the slightest connection that I can see to sparky, clever Elizabeth Bennet.The original idea of having Mr Darcy and Wickham in the story was always amusing. If you can be tolerant of a very weak Mr Darcy and a completely non-Elizabeth, you may well love this movie. 6 stars mostly for Hugh Grant. Without him, it would have been only stars. The movie might have worked better for me if Zellwegger had been Elizabeth Bennet's silly younger sister Lydia and ended up enforcedly with a resentful Wickham! Hugh Grant could have done a great line in greed!",6,0,0,20 January 2010
Quantum of Solace," I'm surprised to say that I enjoyed Quantum of Solace
","The impression I had from some pre-release writeups of QoS and when it appeared from some of the newspaper reviews was Craig wanted Bond to become the brutal, violent killer of Quantum of Solace. Perhaps that isn't true - has he ever said? Whose idea was it to bin all the Bond characteristics? I surprised myself by liking Craig a lot in The Golden Compass - I thought he'd be a disaster as Asriel, although the part so far has been very short so we shall see how it turns out later. If he'd acted Bond in CR in the same way, suave and handsome and sophisticated (yes, in GC he was suave and handsome and sophisticated which proves he can be but the Bond setup seems to want him looking as ugly/unattractive as it can manage), CR would have been a better movie in spite of the messy plot and interminable product placement and some extremely silly sequences. Having loathed CR when I first saw it, I only recently bought a very cheap 2nd hand copy of the 2-disk DVD - it seemed a shame to pass up the chance of keeping the collection going. Watching it this second time, I enjoyed it. Not quite as much as most other Bond movies, but more than Diamonds are Forever and Never Say Never Again which I like least of the Bonds. Having to accept Craig won't go away, Bond isn't acted by a superstar with exciting style, grace and terrific charisma (which I consider all the earlier Bond actors have including Lazenby) I now feel Craig did do some good acting, wasn't as wooden as I remember him from the first viewing though he still looks a bit uneasy in the part at times. I still thought Vesper completely insipid and her delight in Bond's little finger positively sick-inducing. The collapsing building collapsed far quicker than I remembered from the first viewing when I thought it interminable. I never objected to the villain anyway. The defibrillator stuff was still silly. The mobiles and laptops weren't too effective. The Aston Martin shouldn't have been wrecked so quickly, it was totally wasted. The casino scenes with the totally wrong, very inferior game were still annoying. The Omega watch thing was still utterly pathetic . But on the whole, Craig was far better than I remembered and the movie was much better than I remembered, and I will happily watch it again. Nonetheless, I was uneasy about QoS after the very varying and not all that good reviews I'd read. My favourite newspaper, which hadn't been quite sure about CR when others adored it, panned QoS. But I was pleasantly surprised! Indeed there is no sign of humour in this Bond movie - but as it happens it doesn't seem to need it. It isn't a Bourne clone, it's a real Bond movie, and the style I felt was quite a bit lacking in CR has returned. The much-quoted Bourne influence is probably involved in the camera work - but I liked the camera work for Bourne and unlike various others I didn't have any problem as a rule with the frenetic camera work of QoS. Now and again the camera did move just a fraction too fast, it could induce giddiness I suspect in some viewers, but beyond that I think it enhanced what might otherwise have been run of the mill fight or chase scenes, gave them a big adrenalin rush. So I commend the Director and Camera people for this.I loved the first chase scene in particular - extremely exciting. I was just a bit disappointed by the titles though they were better than CR. The music was OK, nothing special but far better than DAD and CR. I thought Bond chasing Vesper's killers might become trite, but it's handled well. Craig has at last grown into the part of Bond which I felt he hadn't achieved too well in CR. Bond has changed dramatically from the guy we used to know - but after QoS I think it possible Craig could, with some 'serious training', eg by his boss and her staff, start to approach the sophistication of Connery's Bond. One has to remember that Connery reportedly came to the part as a rather rough diamond and was trained by the director in all the Bond classy refinements and my didn't he project all that amazingly well so it wouldn't be out of character for this rough diamond Bond to learn as Connery did. I think after seeing QoS that Craig is at last comfortable enough in the part to be able to bring Bond up to some sophistication and after all he is supposed to be Youngish Bond still so there's time. The question though is whether he and the studio want Bond to morph into Connery or if they want to continue with Young Rough-edged, touchy, aggressive Bond. I guess Craig's next Bond movie will show us what's intended. He'll be free of the Vesper baggage, available for proper sexy stuff again, let's see if he can do it and assess a decent cocktail, discover a sense of humour, seduce the girls with the cool efficiency of the earlier Bond, drop the emotional stuff a bit, forget about mediocre Vesper......",7,18,29,3 November 2008
Love Actually," A very enjoyable movie and Hugh Grant is outstanding.
","This movie isn't quite as good as Notting Hill, but it's very good fun. Hugh Grant is the star, as the PM who succeeds Tony Blair at No. 10. His romance with No.10's teagirl is lovely, but even better is his performance as PM doing things we all wanted Tony Blair to do but he didn't! For me Hugh Grant is a class above everyone else in this movie, but if he isn't for you there are plenty of other characters to like as it's an ensemble movie. I don't usually like ensemble movies and I wasn't very keen on Four Weddings but this one works well as all the characters are entertaining.I first saw Colin Firth, so far as I remember, in Pride & Prejudice and it was rumoured that he wasn't keen on the part. Yet he acted it splendidly and received many accolades. I wondered why he'd not be keen on the part - until I saw him in some of his later movies which I think showed Darcy wasn't the kind of part he usually acted. In this movie he suits the part in this movie and his character's romance is really charming - he can't speak her language, she can't speak his....... and so neither has any idea how the other feels. The other story lines include ...A man who stupidly buys a very expensive Christmas prezzie for his predatory secretary even though he really isn't after her at all, and his wife finds out and is devastated. A young boy who's fallen in love with a teenage girl and doesn't know how to tell her. Kids who are acting in The Nativity as all kinds of strange animals (it's a lovely sequence, the actual performance, with an unexpected ending!) A Best Man who's in love with the bride. A young man who goes off to Australia and comes back with a girl for himself and his friend as well. A couple of actors who seem to be making suggestive adverts in which they wear less on each occasion, and their totally detached conversation throughout is hilarious. But the best of all next to Hugh Grant is Alan Rickman (I think it was him anyway) as a very faded popstar who's made a Christmas CD. You mayn't expect how his romance works out but really is Love, Actually.Final comment - would that we had Hugh Grant as our PM!!",10,0,3,26 November 2009
Wedding Crashers," Utter trash, one of the most puerile movies I've ever seen
","It's a pity to have to give even 1 star to this junk. Can't IMDb give us a different indicator for rubbish such as the word AWFUL or blow raspberries? Even one star should indicate something in the movie's worth seeing.Well, I guess the director and photographer got paid for making this ridiculous movie. This is a male fantasy of the silliest and worst kind and in my opinion it must insult anyone's intelligence whether they are male or female. The male so-called stars are crashing bores. The fairhaired one was marginally better if one has to choose because he's better looking and he did occasionally come over as human. The other one seemed to think that to be funny all he had to do was talk as fast as possible or act like a complete moron and surely we'd all roll in the aisles. He was totally unfunny, even when given anything in the script that could have been funny. I never want to see either of these persons ever again in any movie.I suggest you'd only waste time watching this movie if you are a completely chauvinist male who has it in for women, or if you really like being bored out of your skull. Needless to say, after the first simply dire first fifteen mins, I simply skipped through for a while, but it never got any better. I pity anyone who has spent money on viewing this, they must be fuming and wanting a refund. Thank goodness I wasted only some of my time. I wasn't surprised to find the movie was poor since the writeup on it wasn't good but I didn't expect it to be this awful.",1,4,8,17 November 2009
Sherlock Holmes," This James Bond lookalike is entertaining but doesn't quite convince
","It wasn't nearly as good as I'd hoped. Far too much fighting and explosions and the like as Holmes & Watson get involved in endless chases or being chased etc. I grew bored with all this. I'd expected more time to be spent on tricksy clues and challenges for us to solve. On the James Bond angle, neither the script nor the scenes of violence and so on quite convince even though on a superficial level it's very slickly done and you have to get used to this dirty, dreary London that's depicted as Victoria. I've no reason to doubt the authenticity and I imagine many filmgoers liked that a lot, but am I glad I didn't live then in that grimy sepia city. I wanted to get away from it but even Holmes couldn't allow us a clean room to escape into for a short time. Ugh.I quickly guessed who was behind it all and I imagine most others did so that's no secret - in fact, I'd expect anyone who knows anything about Holmes to guess quickly. I was surprised Holmes didn't immediately get that too but I guess they wanted to preserve the secret as long as possible! Downey acted Holmes well enough though I felt he was a bit too young for the part. Jude Law I had noted was in the cast and I didn't expect him to be anything special in whatever part he had - I didn't even realise until the credits at the end that Watson was Jude Law!! He was simply splendid, definitely the star of the show.I won't be surprised if there's a sequel since there's the option given the end of this one. It should be worth seeing.This is a movie I recommend you to see once, but whether you'll want to see it again depends I think on what kind of movies you like. I wouldn't watch it again, not even on TV, because I feel that 'I've seen it, I know what's coming, there aren't any mysteries to puzzle over, so what's the point?' Perhaps in a sequel they could challenge us more?",6,1,4,20 January 2010
The Blind Side," I loved it - and I can't abide any kind of football!
","This is a simply lovely movie and Bullock deserved that Oscar. She is so consistently good in her movies, even if some of the movies are poor, that it's time she had an Oscar anyway. It was amusing she had a Raspberry at the same time but so what? I'm looking forward to seeing All About Steve too - our local cinema pulled it because they had 'too many other movies to show and it was a turkey,' they said. I said I'd have liked the chance to find out, thanks, and I don't believe anything Bullock does can be that bad....She took that Raspberry with her usual good humour and charm, what could do better than that to promote it? I don't have a lot to say about the story of Blind Side because everyone's said it already. It's a wonderful, heartwarming, feel-good movie. So nice to see Bullock in a 'normal marriage situation' instead of struggling with a nasty husband/partner who doesn't appreciate her or treats her like dirt as is the case in some of her movies. Beyond that, it's all about the talented but neglected boy who needs love and help and my how he repays it big time. So good to hear this was based on a true story, I'd like to read the book sometime. A movie to savour and see again. I can't comment on the football, it isn't what we play over here in England and anyway I don't like football at the best of times, but each to their own, it's clearly a popular and lively game and you don't really need to know how it works to enjoy the movie. I could endure the football because the rest of it is so moving and lively and well-crafted.",9,1,2,24 April 2010
Speed," Very exciting movie with one sequence of real horror
","What a brilliant movie!Everyone acts excellently. Sandra Bullock is always in my experience of a number of her movies simply perfect and my she's a classy and clever and athletic lady as well as being very beautiful. I love Keanu Reeves too, he is gorgeous, and after seeing them together in that wonderful movie The Lake House I was very pleased to find them together again in this movie. I see Speed 2 isn't rated highly, although I enjoyed it very much and am surprised it didn't gain more praise. Probably Reeves felt it was to much more of the same? Even so, I wish he could have done it since he and Bullock together are screen magic. Speed it terrifically exciting from start to finish. The tension never lets up. The terrifying finale leaves you drained especially if like me you are identifying closely with the heroine. You should love this movie!",10,1,3,11 November 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Probably brilliant, but just not my kind of movie, I soon gave up watching
","We weren't interested enough in the subject so didn't go to cinema to see this movie, but noticing it on the library shelf the other day, I decided to give it a go as surely with all the prizes etc it must be good.Well, no doubt it is good, but I was bored with it from the start in spite of the social issues etc. I stopped watching after about half an hour, I didn't even look at the extras, and back it went to the library. I'm sure it's well worth most people watching and the subject matter does sound poignant as well as powerful, so don't be put off by my comments.",5,5,8,9 October 2009
The Proposal," Very good, old-fashioned (that's a big compliment) feel-good comedy
","Contains a spoiler.....I loved every moment of this movie. Yes, totally predictable, although at the end I was getting just a bit anxious that it was going to be one of those bitter-sweet endings that usually I hate .... But, fortunately not.Everyone acts well, it's all great fun, lots of laughs and also poignant moments. A lovely feel-good movie.Beautiful scenery, wherever it was filmed. I hadn't seen Sandra Bullock before. Now I've seen a few more of her movies and am a firm admirer. Looking forward to her next,",10,2,7,28 August 2009
