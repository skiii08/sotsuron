Minority Report," Just another science fiction giant!
","If you're a fan of science fiction movies at all, you should rest assure that Minority Report aimed to please and most likely will.  It's got action, great science theory, and these GREAT advertisements.  Look in the background, you'll see advertisements galore with one that includes an aquafina hologram of water pouring out onto the street!  They're great! They'll even scan your eye, find out who you are, and use it in their advertisment.  Like 'Mr. Anderson, when was the last time you had a Dr. Pepper?'  Just great ideas and a great plot.",9,0,0,8 August 2002
Resident Evil," Pretty Good
","Resident Evil was about as good as could be expected from a video game genre.  The idea of having a Resident Evil movie was really exciting to me as a lover of Resident Evil 2's action and horror elements.  The movie adapted these elements fairly well with movie style and the video game's idea.  However, there was something about it that left you wanting maybe a little MORE of the video game's magic.  Maybe more blood.  Maybe more surprises.  I personally think the 2nd one will be much better.  That is if it picks up where the first left off.  Because I loved walking through that alley and being freaked out by the things that would pop up.  Most of them were zombies but some of them were dogs and assorted evils.  But anyway, you get the idea.  It was Resident Evil alright, but like Diet Resident Evil. Or Resident Evil Light.  It wasn't as filling as the game, plain and simply.",7,0,0,8 August 2002
