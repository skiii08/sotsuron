Miracle," Do you believe in miracles?
","One of my earliest clear sports memory was the hockey game between the US and USSR. I don't remember their names from back then--I've been reminded from articles, stories, and ESPN's replays of the game--but I remember the game, the upset, the excitement on TV. It is the game that made me the hockey fan I am today. I was just shy of ten, so I didn't appreciate the bigger picture of the game.Now that I'm older, I have a greater understanding of history, the Cold War, and hockey. So when Disney's 'Miracle' came out, I looked forward to seeing it. It is the story of how Herb Brooks assembled a team of college hockey players--almost all of whom were from Minnesota and Boston area colleges--to compete against the world's greatest teams from Northern and Eastern Europe, some of which had been playing together for a decade.The movie opened with news clips from the turbulent 1970s, starting with the war in Vietnam through the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It was one of the darkest times in American history, and we needed something to be proud of.Kirk Russell played Brooks, the coach of the young American team who was the last player cut from the 1960 Gold Medal Team. He recreated Brooks perfectly, from his clothes to his accent to his mannerisms. Oddly, as Brooks used amateur players, director Gavin O'Connor used mostly amateur actors for the movie. All but Eddie Cahill, who played goalie Jim Craig, had no acting experience at all. They were hockey players who learned how to act on the fly. Despite that, the acting was quite good. And Disney got Al Michaels and Ken Dryden to reprise their roles as themselves announcing the game.In the titles after the movie, we learn where the players are and what they do now. Only a few of the twenty players made it to the NHL, and only two or three are still affiliated with organized hockey now. But for two precious weeks, these young men gave us something to be proud of.Stay until the end. They dedicate the movie to Herb Brooks, who died in an auto accident last winter.",9,1,1,29 February 2004
Requiem for a Dream," Shattered Dreams
","'Requiem for a Dream' is written to scare the hell out of anyone who even thinks of using drugs.Ellen Burstyn was Oscar worthy as Sara, the lonely Jewish mother who passes time by watching TV and talking to the other old Jewish women on her block in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. She's important to no one until she receives a mysterious call telling her she's going to be on TV. She finds a red dress that she hasn't worn in years and no longer fits into. She sees her doctor, who prescribes weight-loss stimulants. She quickly becomes addicted to both TV and the pills, begins hallucinating, and eventually suffers full-blown schizophrenia.Jared Leto is Sara's son Harry. His drugs of choice are marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. He and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) score and distribute the drugs around the Coney Island-Brighton Beach area. (Wayans is an ironic choice, as he is pro-drug and thinks addiction is something to joke about, as evidenced by his 'Scary Movie.')The incredibly beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly is Marion, Harry's girlfriend. She gets hooked almost immediately, and her dire need of future fixes is rough. But her frantic search for drugs around the apartment mid-way through the film is gut-wrenching.My main problem with the movie is this: Am I supposed to feel sorry for these three cokeheads? Because I don't. Unlike Sara, whose ethically challenged doctor prescribed her addictive drugs, they made a conscious decision to use. In a way, they got what they deserved. My other problem is that I did not need the extreme closeups of dilating eyes, popping pills, coke snorts, and nickle bags being zip-locked. The sound effects got really annoying too. I got the hint the first time around; they didn't need to repeat it a dozen times. The end of this film is absolutely brutal. Addiction defeats all of the characters in different ways; they all suffer different fates, all horrible.",7,1,2,17 August 2003
Spider-Man 2," more than eye candy
","Two years ago, when I saw 'Spiderman,' I figured it would be an action movie--some good summertime eye candy. Boy, was I wrong! It was an intelligent love story which happened to involve a superhero. And at a time when most sequels are made to try gouge Americans at the box office, 'Spiderman 2' is a rare exception.The story continues two years after Harry Osborne (James Franco) buried his father. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is a Broadway star, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) delivers pizzas while studying as an undergrad at (I assume) Columbia, and Harry is running OsCorp. Harry is obsessed with avenging his father's death, which he still blames on Spiderman, and takes it out on Peter. Meanwhile, Jonah Jameson's (JK Simmons) is still ripping off his freelancers while he prepares for his son's wedding... to MJ.So Dr. Octavious (Alfred Molina), Peter's hero and the subject of his term paper, finds a way to harness the power of the sun using the four-clawed back attachment. Of course, the prototype is a complete disaster, and instead of controlling the prototype, it controls Dr. Octavious (now Doc Ock).Much of the action is formulaic, but the storyline (especially the love story) and the effects make up for it. It also helped that the entire cast of the original is back, including Rosemary Harris (as Aunt May), Cliff Robertson (as Uncle Ben), and Willem Dafoe (as Norman Osborne).There's a great foreshadow into 'Spiderman 3,' which will probably come out in the summer of 2006.",9,0,0,19 July 2004
Lost in Translation," Great acting, but could have been better
","What happens when two depressed people trapped in unhappy marriages find themselves in Tokyo? You get 'Lost in Translation,' a story of two lonely people lost deep inside themselves.Bill Murray is perfectly cast as Bob Harris, a has-been actor who is in Tokyo to film whiskey ads and do some annoying TV interviews. Rookie actress Scarlett Johansson is also great as Charlotte, a lonely young wife of a photographer. They meet in a hotel bar, and its friendship at first sight. Together they paint the town, learn about each other, and find in each other a reason to live.While the performances are Oscar worthy, Sofia Coppola's direction is not. She could have done much more in developing their friendship, even have the pair have second meaning-of-life talk. (The one they had--simply Murray and Johansson in bed, fully clothed, wondering if life ever gets any easier--was the best scene in the movie.) Other than the karaoke scene, during which Murray does a funny rendition of Elvis Costello's 'Peace, Love, and Understanding,' the music was just out there. The movie is rated R because of one completely unnecessary scene in a Japanese nudie bar, while a song called (I'm not kidding) 'F--- the Pain Away' plays. Take out that scene, you have a cleaner and probably better PG13 or even PG film. She'll get better.Overall, a good movie that could have been better. 5/10.",5,0,0,29 February 2004
Corpse Bride," A new generation of animation
","I don't care how visually brilliant an animated movie is. These days, if it doesn't have a good story, interesting characters, appropriate music, and competent actors, the movie is going to suck. I want to feel like I'm watching a live-action movie. Fortunately, Tim Burton is a wonderful storyteller, and 'Corpse Bride' is an example of his imagination.Victor (Johnny Depp) is about to meet his bride Victoria (Emily Watson) for the first time. It's early 19th century England, so it is an arranged marriage. During the rehearsal, he keeps flubbing his vows, panics, and runs into the woods. He practices, and when he finally gets it right, he places the ring on a tree branch. Except that it isn't a tree branch. It's the finger of a corpse (Helena Bonham Carter), and she thinks she's now married to Victor! He runs, crashes into a tree, and knocks himself out.When he comes to, he finds himself in--it's not really Hell, and it's not really Heaven, so we'll just call it the underworld. Bonejangles (Danny Elfman) tells the 'tragic tale of romance, passion, and a murder most foul' in a jazzy song-and-dance routine. Victor becomes friends with Emily, the Corpse Bride, and she falls head-over-heels in love with him. But he's not sure if he wants to live among the dead, and he's torn between Emily and Victoria.The stop-motion animation is the same style as 'The Nightmare Before Christmas.' The animation has come a long way since 1993, but I liked 'Nightmare's' story more. There are some parallels, but contrary to rumor, Jack Skellington does not make a cameo. Overall, this is a beautiful love story with likable characters, catchy music, and, of course, visually brilliant animation.PG for scary stuff. Most kids who understand death and/or love will enjoy it.",9,10,14,28 September 2005
Lilo & Stitch," Forget everything you think you know about Disney
","This one's unique, different, better. There are no major stars; the only actors I recognized were Tia Carrere (Nani), David Ogden Stiers (Jookiba), and Ving Rhames (Mr. Bubbles). But the action, the story, and the jokes were so original, you'll forget this came out of Disney's studios. They even threw in Elvis (Lilo's favorite) to make the parents happy.",9,1,1,28 July 2002
Armageddon," How bad was this movie?
","The acting was horrible. The special effects, while exceptional, dominated the movie. The writing was pathetic, and the dialogue was unbelievable. And the silly little love story between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was out of place.But the worst offense of 'Armageddon' was the total lack of scientific reality. 'The asteroid is the size of Texas,' says Billy Bob Thornton. Er, that's 800 miles wide! No one in NASA even sees the asteroid until a midday meteor shower wrecks havoc in New York? Suuuuure. NASA hires a drilling team to join the astronauts and trains them in a week? Yeah, right. Someone brings a sidearm on the Space Shuttle with them? Yeah, that's realistic. And Bruce Willis blows up the asteroid with three seconds to spare. How Disney-esque!How bad was this movie? I rooted for the asteroid!",2,12,23,9 March 2003
Edward Scissorhands," Still Johnny Depp's greatest role
","Johnny Depp's portrayal of Edward Scissorhands ranks as the best I have seen from him. He gives the gentle, shy, quiet Edward a wonderful depth so rare in Hollywood. He speaks little, but most of his emotion is expressed through his actions and facial expressions.Edward is an invention, an artificial creation, but he has feelings. Especially for Kim Boggs, beautifully played by Winona Ryder, for whom he would do anything. He loves her, knowing she doesn't have the same feelings toward him. He doesn't try to get her to love him. He is just himself, and hopes that's good enough.Edward is an outcast, but this is more than just an outcast-trying-to-fit-in love story. It is a deep story of family and friendship, love and loss. Tim Burton's darkly eccentric direction pulls out the best from the supporting Diane Wiest, Alan Arkin, and Vincent Price.",9,0,0,25 December 2003
Pearl Harbor," A typical Disney/Bruckheimer/Bay action flick
","What is a Disney/Bruckheimer/Bay action flick? It is heavy on special effects; includes a dopey love story; lacks historical accuracy and/or scientific reality; and has awful acting (mostly by Ben Affleck), writing, and character development. 'Armageddon' is the most obvious example; 'Pearl Harbor' is another.The first hour-plus of 'Pearl Harbor' is the dopey love triangle. Rafe McCawley (Affleck) goes to 'downtown London' (no one says downtown -- it's known as Central London) to serve in the RAF as a fighter pilot. I don't know how, in one night, he was able to train to the point where he can not only fly a completely different aircraft, but shoot down a German bomber. Believing he is killed in action, his best friend Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) comforts--and hooks with--his girlfriend Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). The two men fight on the night of December 6th, and of course by the time the bombing starts they're best friends again.The attack on Pearl Harbor: The action sequences were well directed and choreographed, but they too were loaded with historical mistakes for the sake of dramatic license. One thing done right was Dory Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), the cook who shot down an enemy plane and was later awarded the Navy Cross. But I doubt the real Dory Miller jumped and hollered when he did it.Then they include a scene or two with the Japanese fleet, which I guess is an attempt to give us both sides of the story, or to give the audience an enemy to hate. But Admiral Yamamoto was portrayed wrongly: he wasn't gung-ho about attacking Pearl Harbor, he lamented the decision.The movie could have ended with Roosevelt's (Jon Voight) address to Congress -- and even *that* had mistakes in it -- but it dragged on for another hour with Dolittle's Raid over Tokyo. James Doolittle is played poorly by anti-war mouthpiece Alec Baldwin, who acts like a cheerleader rather than a military leader. And all of the sudden, Walker and McKawley are bomber pilots?Now, contrast this with 1970's 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' which is practically a history lesson disguised as a feature film; or even 1953's 'From Here To Eternity,' a smartly written and well acted love story set in November of 1941. 'Pearl Harbor' tries to be both, but it fails miserably.",2,22,39,26 August 2006
Quantum of Solace," Great action thriller, lousy Bond movie
","Sounds contradictory, I know, but Quantum of Solace is exactly that.Bond is back and out for revenge. The first Bond movie to be more of a continuation than a sequel, Quantum starts with Bond trying to deliver Mr. White (shot in the last scene of Casino Royale) to M. Of course, he is being chased by men with machine guns. During the interrogation, Mr. White tells M, 'The first thing you should know about us is... we have people everywhere.' And he means everywhere, including MI-6.The movie is non-stop action. There's very little drama, and almost no humor. Come to think of it, there's a lot missing from Quantum no vodka martini, no Q, no gun-barrel sequence, and Bond only got one kiss. And somehow, three writers couldn't figure out a way to include the line, 'Bond, James Bond.' Yes, this was a great action movie, but it just wasn't a Bond movie.",6,2,9,18 July 2009
The Lives of Others," A look into fascism
","It is rare to see a movie about how a police state immerses itself into the lives of its citizens, recording every detail of their existence. Many such films show a hero who takes on the establishment, or an villainous officer who moves up in the ranks by destroying people. But 'The Lives of Others' tells a very human story from the viewpoint of a Staci officer.Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) is an East German playwright who is surprisingly loyal to the state. Yet his loyalty arouses the suspicion of two Stasi officers, and they accuse him of conspiracy and subversion. So the Stasi assigns Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) to spy on Dreyman and his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). The Stasi bugged the apartments and tapped the phone lines of the couple and their friends, and tried to turn one of their friends against them. Wiesler preceded to listen to every conversation they had over the course of five months. Complicating matters is Cultural Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme), who wants to have Georg arrested so he can have Christa to himself.But as he listens to the intricate details of the couple's life together, Weisler grows to envy, respect, even like Georg and Christa. His character evolves from a cold robotic bureaucrat to emotional human. Mühe's performance as the Stasi captain is nothing short of brilliant. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, in his directorial debut, overlooks no detail as he puts his audience in 1984 GDR.Far from nostalgic, 'The Lives of Others' examines the power of the Stasi and its impact on the people of the GDR.",9,1,4,4 September 2007
I Am Legend," Will Smith carries the movie
","In 2009, Dr. Krippen finds a cure for cancer by mutating a measles virus. Unfortunately, the virus, mutated to attack only cancerous cells, gains a life of its own. It spreads rapidly around the globe, and within three years, 90% of human life is wiped out.Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a military scientist who is one of 12 million people who were naturally immune to KV. Dr. Neville is the sole survivor in the City of New York. So far as he knows, he and his dog Sam are all that is left of civilization. But he is not alone. The rest of the survivors became zombies, feeding off the healthy survivors.To ease his loneliness, he sets up a few mannequins across the city so that he has someone to greet as he makes his daily rounds (like Tom Hanks and Wilson in 'Cast Away'). He also turned his basement into a lab in which he experiments with rats, trying to find a cure for the virus.One of the unique aspects of 'I Am Legend,' compared to other post-apocalypse movies, is the zombies had personalities. The Alpha Male is not only strong and tough, he is also very smart, able to set a trap for Neville and rally hundreds of zombies to fight with him. He was also smart enough to search all parts of Neville's townhouse.The movie is not without its flaws, but it is much better than the Omega Man. There are some really good scares, and Will Smith was terrific in the lead.",8,2,5,23 December 2007
School of Rock," Today's assignment, kick some ass!
","And the kids in this movie did. A collection of unknown preteens with musical talents no child has a right to make this movie special.Jack Black is Dewey Finn, a rock singer and guitarist who has just been kicked out of his own band for his pathetic 'showmanship.' His best friend and roommate is Ned Schneebly (Mike White), a substitute teacher working toward his teaching certificate (like yours truly). One day, Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack), principal of an elite prep school, calls looking for Ned for a long-term sub position. Dewey seizes the opportunity, pretends to be Ned and accepts the position. He proceeds to introduce his fifth graders to rock & roll, creating a complete rock band (including roadies, groupies, security, and a manager). Along the way he inspires them to follow their dreams, and teaches them the important life lesson of sticking it to the man.But he also uses the kids to get himself into a city-wide Battle of the Bands. He tricks the neurotic, overprotective Principal Mullins into allowing a 'class trip' to the concert. He has the children forsake normal fifth grade classwork to learn about rock music. Then the parents find out.I especially want to point out the musicians Joey Gaydos (Zack, guitar), Robert Tsai (Lawrence, keyboard), Rebecca Brown (Katie, cello and bass), Kevin Clark (Freddy, drums), and most of all, vocalists Maryam Hassan, Caitlin Hale, and Aleisha Allen (Tamika, Marta, and Alicia respectively) whose vocal cords are gifts from G*d.'School of Rock' was warm-hearted, funny movie that really rocked, thanks in part to Black's comedic and musical talent, White's screen- and song-writing, Joan Cusack's anal goofiness, and mostly, the children.Rating note: There is absolutely no reason that the MPAA gave 'School of Rock' a PG13 rating instead of a PG. There is some minor language, some crude humor, and one drug reference in which Dewey jokes another teacher is on crack.",8,1,1,5 July 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," What journalism used to be
","In 1954, television was still a new invention. Few Americans owned one, and those who did had only three or four channels to choose from. It was the time of the Red Scare, of Joe McCarthy's House Un-American Activities Committee, of Edward R. Murrow.'Good Night, and Good Luck' is not your typical biopic or docudrama. It does not delve into Murrow's childhood or marriage. Murrow (David Strathairn) and his news producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) learn an obscure story of an Air Force Lieutenant who is discharged because his father might have been a Communist. With his commander ('24''s Glenn Morshower) unwilling or unable to explain his dismissal (one of the contents of a top secret envelope), Murrow and his team take on the ring leader of the Pinko witch hunt, Sen. McCarthy. (And if you don't think it can happen now, visit a university campus or listen to talk radio, and take note of the venom spewed by so-called 'experts' who think they have a monopoly on truth.) Standing in the way is CBS news manager William Paley (Frank Langella), who has to balance his journalists' integrity and freedom with the desires of his sponsor Alcoa. Murrow convinces Paley to let him run his critique of the Senator, mostly by washing his (Paley's) hands of Murrow if it blows up. So on March 9, 1954, Murrow's show 'See It Now' used McCarthy's own speeches to show inconsistencies between his words and actions.A month later, McCarthy appeared on 'See It Now,' accusing Murrow of being affiliated with the Communist Party. Of course, he had no proof. 'We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty,' Murrow says. Viewers responded overwhelmingly against McCarthy. After that, politicians of all stripes openly criticized McCarthy, and McCarthy's career spiraled downward.Filled with jazz and cigarette smoke and filmed in black & white, 'Good Night and Good Luck' brings the viewer back to 1954. Patricia Clarkson, Jeff Daniels, Robert Downey Jr., and Ray Wise round out the supporting cast with terrific credibility. At only 93 minutes, the movie--which has no sex, no violence, and only one blasphemous swear word--is anything but boring, letting the drama of the time dictate the action.'Good Night and Good Luck' is less a movie about McCarthyism than it is about courage and journalistic integrity. All journalists, especially those who tripped over themselves to cover OJ Simpson's trial and Anna Nicole Smith's death, and columnists who close their minds to the opinions of others, need to see this movie so they could learn what journalism really is.",10,3,5,5 March 2007
Shrek 2," Can a sequel be better than the original? Really really.
","Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) rides across heat and cold to reach the castle, races up to the highest room of the tallest tower to rescue the princess from her prison, pulls back the curtains of her bed... and gasps!'Shrek 2' picks up where 'Shrek' left off: Shrek and Fiona are on their honeymoon as Donkey watches over the Swamp. When they return, Fiona receives a message from her parents, the King and Queen (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) of Far Far Away, summoning her to a ball honoring her and her groom. So the three of them pack up the onion carriage and head off on their long journey.When King Harold finds out what his baby girl married and what she's become, he hires Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas)--an assassin with a nasty case of hairballs--to whack Shrek, hoping she'll fall in love with Charming (who is anything but). But Shrek and Puss become fast friends, and plot a way to foil Fairy Godmother's (Jennifer Saunders) plan to force Fiona to marry Charming.There's more on-screen singing, most of which is performed by Murphy and Saunders. The finale is Murphy and Banderas, in character, singing 'La Vida Loca.''Shrek 2' continues to fire shots at Disney, but also skewers commercialism (Saxon Fifth Avenue), the Brothers Grimm, pop culture, 'Cops,' and Hollywood (note the sign on the hillside), while giving its audience a new message: loving one's self.I didn't think the sequel could possibly hold a candle to 'Shrek,' but I was wrong. It is funnier and more touching than the original. 10/10PG: Crude humor that most little ones won't get anyway.",10,1,2,2 June 2004
World Trade Center," A must see... for those who can
","This is not an easy movie to watch. Much of the movie shows PAPD Officer Will Jimeno (Michael Peña) and Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) under the rubble of World Trade Center Two. It is dark and claustrophobic, and you will feel their pain, their anger, and their fear. They literally kept each other alive by talking to each other, knowing that if they fell asleep, odds are they wouldn't wake up, and if one died, the other would, too.But 'World Trade Center' is not told solely from the point of view of the officers. It also looks at Allison Jimeno and Donna McLaughlin (Maggie Gyllenhall and Maria Bello are perfectly cast), the wives of the hero officers, as well as their families, and the toll the day's events took on their lives.I'm the first to admit that when I heard Oliver Stone was directing 'World Trade Center,' I worried that it would be a political commentary laden with conspiracy theories. Far from it. Stone and writer Andrea Berloff took great care in leaving politics out of the movie. The dialogue was not only believable, but it was all New York. You can tell that the four stars spent a lot of time with the people they portray.The only thing I would have changed in this movie is to have the time of day in which the scenes took place, just for continuity.If you can watch a movie based on the single worst day in American history, I urge you to see 'World Trade Center.'",10,3,7,31 August 2006
Black Hawk Down," Very intense war movie.

Big Fish," Another great Tim Burton movie
","Scot Ewen McGregor and Brit Albert Finney star as Edward Bloom, a 'big fish' in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama. Edward's tall tales impress and entertain everyone except his son Will. Will is most bothered that, at the age of 30 and about to have his first child, he still knows little of who his father really is. So when Will gets a call from his mother (Jessica Lange, looking great at 55) saying his father is dying of cancer, Will used the opportunity to get to know the truth about the man.Told completely in flashback from several characters, Will learns of his father's successes and failures. From his childhood, when he and four friends visited the local witch (Helena Bonham Carter), who could predict when and how he would die; to his adolesence, when he starred on the high school baseball, football, and basketball teams, and then befriended a wandering giant; to his adulthood, when he roamed around Alabama, finding the perfect town of Spectre, joining the Calloway (Danny Devito) Circus, seeing the love of his life ('White Oleander''s Alison Lohman), and spending the next three years pursuing her.Worth mentioning is the supporting cast, a fabulous array of famous actors and unknowns who contributed to 'Big Fish.' The visual effects were done perfectly, just enough to enhance the story without taking control of the movie.Much like 'Forrest Gump' with Burton's trademark quirkiness, 'Big Fish' is a trip through time as seen through one man's life.Rating note: There is some brief nudity, without which 'Big Fish' probably could have gotten away with a PG. But this is far from a kids' movie. Suggested ages: middle school and up.",8,0,0,27 January 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Jim Carrey does drama
","If anyone still doubts that Jim Carrey can be a serious dramatic actor, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' will erase (pun not intended) all doubts.Carrey plays Joel, a depressed, anxious, phobic man who can't catch a break. In the opening scene, he spontaneously decides to blow off work and take a train out to Montauk. There he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), a free spirit and alcoholic, and they hit it off immediately. (Who says opposites don't attract?)In the next scene, Joel is crying his eyes out because Clementine not only left him for another man, but she has absolutely no recollection of him. So Joel decides to go to a doctor (Tom Wilkinson) to get his Clem erased from his memory.From this point, the story of Clem and Joel's relationship is told backward, sort of like 'Memento.' The imagery in the flashback scenes is nothing short of wonderful. Director Michael Gondry uses a spotlight to point to what part of Joel's memory is being erased, while Joel and Clem try to stay away from the light so the Erasers can't find her.Speaking of the Erasers, Mark Ruffalo are Elijah Wood hysterical as Stan and Patrick, the techies who spend the night erasing Joel's memory. Kirsten Dunst is great as Mary, the doctor's receptionist and Stan's stoner girlfriend.But the best part of 'Eternal Sunshine' is Jim Carrey. He leaves his goofiness behind (well, most of it anyway) to do another terrific dramatic performance. Joel is the most emotional character in the movie, whereas Clem is the wild, zany sexpot.I didn't see 'Being John Malkovich' or 'Adaptation,' so I can't compare 'Eternal Sunshine' to Charles Kaufman's other movies. But I enjoyed it. It is an artistic, smart, sexy, and touching romantic dramedy about fighting fate to find happiness. (9/10)",9,0,1,20 March 2004
The Da Vinci Code," Not as good as the novel...
","...but few movies are. Too much was changed from the book to the movie, including a critical scene with DaVinci's masterpiece 'Madonna on the Rocks,' the importance of the Golden Ratio to the artist (as in 'Vitruvian Man'), and a scene with the cryptic (it had two layers of codes in the book, only one in the movie).It was cool to see DaVinci's paintings, particularly 'The Last Supper,' used in the context of the book. I had a hard time picturing the details of the painting, specifically the posing of Mary Magdalene and Jesus.I thought all along that Tom Hanks (one of my favorite actors) was a bit miscast as Langdon, but he was credible. Audrey Tautou is understatedly beautiful and sophisticated as Princess Sophie. Jean Reno played Capt. Fache as if the role was written for him. Ian 'Gandolf' McKellan was perfect as the obsessive Grail historian Leigh Teabing. And Paul Bettany was spooky as the Opus Dei assassin Silas.Bottom line, 'The DaVinci Code' didn't live up to the hype, but was nowhere near as bad as the critics say. 7 out of 10.and now, a rant: The worst part of The DaVinci Code had nothing to do with either the book or the movie. We had to sit through 18 minutes of commercials (yes, commercials!) before the previews. Now I don't know about you the reader, but I go to the movies to escape the commercials. People in the theater were actually booing and yelling. I don't drop $9.50 on a movie so I can watch commercials that I can see at home. In my theater in North Jersey, the commercials were for Cablevision and its subsidiaries I/O digital cable and Optimum Online, none of which are even available in my area.",7,0,2,21 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," As close to the book as I've ever seen
","I don't think I have ever seen a movie that has so closely followed its parent novel as 'Harry Potter.' Huge chunks of dialogue were taken verbatim from the book. The special effects were terrific, the kids were perfectly cast (although I pictured Neville as a short, scrawny type), and I finally got to see how to play Quiddich.On the down side, Peeves the Pesky Poltergeist had to be cut from the screenplay.

The Matrix Reloaded," Great movie making, but no reality
","The Matrix Reloaded raised the bar for movie making. The slow and stop motion cinematography and the martial arts fights were very well done. The directors and their CGI team blurred the line between actors and computer generated images.However, many of the stunts were out-and-out silly. There was little or no sense of reality in either the future or present scenes.If you see this movie, and it is worth seeing, you must see it on the big screen.",6,0,0,15 May 2003

","'Cops and criminals... What's the difference?' I'm not sure Martin Scorcese knows the difference. I can't believe this trash won anything. It is racist, anti-gay, disgustingly violent, and ridiculously vulgar. But the worst offense: It wasn't even a good movie. I hated just about every single character. Apparently if your movie has enough blood and gore, plenty of bigotry, and has a few hundred different uses of the word 'fuck,' and still manages to avoid an NC17, you too can win best director and screenplay.Since Scorcese and Monahan can't tell the difference between cops and criminals, when they need one, I hope they get the other. And since they think firefighters are just a bunch of homos, I hope they're victims of the next terror attack.That, dear reader, is justice.",1,0,3,22 March 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas strikes back!
","George Lucas tied up all of the loose ends of the Star Wars epic. We finally see how exactly how Anakin Skywalker fell to the Dark Side and became Darth Vader. The story is no secret: Palpatine uses the Force to gain absolute power both as a Sith Lord and as the Chancellor/Emperor, and seduces Anakin to the Dark Side.The opening scene is more action packed than the other five movies. Anikan and Obi-Wan must penetrate the defenses of General Grevious (a CGI character), the separatist leader, and rescue the kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine. They become close friends, and Palpatine reveals that he is the Sith Lord whom the Jedi have been hunting for years. He coaxes Anakin to the Dark Side by telling him how Anakin could grant his pregnant wife PadmÃ© (whom Palpatine mentions by name) immortality. Then he creates distrust between Anakin and the Jedi council, portraying himself as an innocent victim of the Jedi's quest for power.Hayden Christiansen seemed to take some acting lessons over the last three years. He does a much better job as both Anikan and Vader in 'Sith' than in 'Clones.' Ewan McGregor makes a great transition from the young Jedi into the wise old hermit he becomes in 'A New Hope.' And the script is just so much better than 'Phanton Menace' and 'Clones'--it seems like mature adults are talking, not a bunch of whiny teenagers.9 out of 10 because of some minor problems I had. First, Anikan seems to fall way too easily. Second, James Earl Jones wasn't in the episode enough. I would have liked Grevious to have been human rather than animated, too. Chewbacca makes an appearance, but is not used enough, and we don't get to see how he teams up with Han Solo. Finally, there are some inconsistencies between what happened in 'Sith' and what Obi-Wan told Luke in 'A New Hope.'Political note: Despite a particular line that sounds like something President Bush would say, 'Sith' (and 'Phantom Menace' and 'Clones' for that matter) is based on the fall of the Roman Republic into the Holy Roman Empire.Rating note: Parents, 'Sith' is PG13 with good reason. It is dark, intense, and in some scenes too scary for young viewers. Know your children.",9,2,6,23 May 2005
Shrek," A terrific movie for kids of all ages
","Once upon a time, there lived an ogre named Shrek (Mike Meyers). Shrek liked the quiet life in his swamp, until Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow)evicted all of the fairy tale animals from his Kingdom. The animals move into Shrek's swamp, which he is not happy about. So he and the fast-talking Donkey (Eddie Murphy) visit Farquaad to work out a deal: Shrek will rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a fire-breathing dragon, in exchange for taking the animals back.While spoofing every fairy tale from Three Blind Mice to Three Little Pigs, and taking numerous shots at Disney, Shrek's message is not lost. One cannot always see beauty from the outside. I haven't seen a movie this funny in years. Bring the kids! I'd say 4 and up. There is some mildly crude humor, but little ones won't get it anyway.",10,0,0,26 October 2001
Casino Royale," A new age, a new Bond
","Daniel Craig may be blond, but he is the Bond that Ian Fleming wrote for. He is cold, tough, egotistical, and brutal. From the opening sequence, filmed in black-and-white, shows Bond's first two kills: drowning one after a fistfight in the men's room, shooting the other after emptying his pistol. He does so without mercy, emotion, and smart-ass one-liners.Craig is the Bond who disregards M's direct orders, breaks into her home, and steals her MI6 passcodes. He shoots up an African embassy to capture a single bomb-maker. He turns down certain sex with a gorgeous Italian model for work. He uses his fists, his gun, and his wits to beat his enemies. No Bond-like gadgets and toys, as Q doesn't even appear, a first since 'Dr. No.' Even the opening credits show a tougher Bond. Gone are the tasteful silhouettes of nude women, replaced with an image of Bond punching and shooting animated baddies, who bleed clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades.'Casino Royale' terrific Bond movie - perhaps not the best one, bit easily the best since 'Live and Let Die' (1973), and Daniel Craig instantly replaces Pierce Brosnan as the #2 Bond.",10,0,3,29 December 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Wow! Just wow!
","It's hard to review 'LOTR: The Return of the King' without regards to the first two movies. Unlike most series, 'King' was written and filmed at the same time as the other two, so no one had to struggle to come up with another script. LOTR was probably the riskiest venture ever taken in the history of movies, and it was worth every penny.'King' opens by showing us something that was not written into the LOTR novels: How an innocent Hobbit named Smeagol became possessed by the One Ring and became Gollum. From there, 'King' picks up right where 'The Two Towers' left off. Helm's Deep was successfully defended against Saruman's evil Uruk-Hai, but at tremendous cost to both Rohan and Elven warriors. Gollum, who has retaken Smeagol's body, leads Frodo and Sam into Mordor. And Merry and Pippen are getting stoned at Isengard, now taken over by the Ents.A three-and-a-half hour adventure follows. As Gandalf and Pippin race from Rohan to Gondor to warn the acting king of an impending attack by the Orcs and Uruk-Hai, Merry, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and Merry join Eowyn, Theoden, and Rohan's troops in the final battle at Minas Tirith. If you thought the Battle of Helm's Deep was incredible, the Battle of Minas Tirith is even better.Then there was Shelob, the giant spider of Mordor moved from 'The Two Towers' novel to 'King' in the movies. In one of the scarier scenes in the series, Shelob spins Frodo into a mummifying web and waits to eat him.The three epiloges carry on for at least 20 minutes, but they cover three or four chapters in the novel, so in order to keep with Tolkien's stories, Peter Jackson had to keep all three.'LOTR: The Return of the King' is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",10,0,0,25 December 2003
V for Vendetta," Does fascism justify terrorism?
","In the near future, after the United States collapses and England is plagued by a biological terror attack, a Christian fundamentalist (John Hurt) is elected chancellor, and immediately enforces Nazi-esquire restrictions and curfews. He creates a propaganda ministry which controls all media, and a secret police called the fingermen.Evey (Natalie Portman) is an aspiring actress who works as an assistant at the state-run TV station. One night, she is accosted by three fingermen. Out of the shadows comes a mysterious man (Hugo Weaving) wearing a cape and a Guy Fawkes mask, and referring to himself only as V. He is trained in hand-to-hand fighting and speaks poetically and articulately.The following morning, he attacks the TV station where Evey works. He forces them to play a DVD, in which he explains his admiration for Guy Fawkes, his grievances with the government, and his intention to do what Fawkes failed to accomplish 400 years ago: blow up Parliament. Feeling obligated to help the vigilante who saved her, she helps him escape when the police surround him.As Evey and V become friends, we learn that her entire family fell victim to the government, as did V. He is not just fighting for the freedom of England, but for his own personal vendetta against those who made him the monster he knows he is.Stephen Rea is well cast in support as Inspector Finch, assigned to find V and bring him to justice. Hugo Weaving creates a sympathetic vigilante, despite the fact that we never see his face. Natalie Portman is perfect as Evey, the character she famously shaved her head to play.Many of the themes have been examined before, most obviously in George Orwell's masterpiece '1984,' but also in the second 'Star Wars' trilogy, in which politician uses a crisis to force himself into the position of a supreme leader. What is new is the dilemma of who is a freedom fighter and who is a terrorist.'V for Vendetta' is intelligent and disturbing. The imagery is beautifully artistic, the characters complex and sympathetic, and the future frighteningly Orwellian. The final battle between V and the police is gratuitously violent and unrealistic, but it makes a point: Ideas cannot die and one man can make a difference.",7,3,6,24 February 2007
