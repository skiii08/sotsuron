It," Wait For A Netflix Release
","Acting - Good job by all, especially the kids and the clown - 8/10Dialogue - The kids spoke like kids! - 10/10Plot - IT felt lost and had multiple films within itself - 5/10Directing - Some aspects of clever suspense however spoiled by multiple shot angles at the end and random slow motion in the middle - 6/10Horror - Plenty of cheap jump scares, fake scares and undoing of the suspense it works hard to build up. The film does have some great moments early on however that does give you chills - 5/10Conclusion - This is a good horror movie in comparison to many bad ones that are released. The film had potential and sometimes showed it well. I might watch this film again on Netflix one day, it definitely was forgettable. 6/10",6,3,7,16 September 2017
