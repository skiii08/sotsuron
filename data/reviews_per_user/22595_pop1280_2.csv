The Ring," one of the most effective horror films ever
","The Ring is part of the little horror film renaissance that has occurred over the last two years, after the 80s and 90s produced so very few good fright films.  The last two years have seen Devil's Backbone, the Others, Frailty, Audition, and Session 9, an output that rivals the entire run of the previous two decades.  Not to say that is all roses, the Dark Castle films, especially 13 Ghosts and the truly awful Feardotcom, are terrible films that represent everything bad about American horror.  Now comes the Ring, a vast improvement over the original Japanese version, and a truly scary film.  I can find no real fault with any aspect of the movie, and it stuck with me for weeks afterwards.  Of particular excellence is the Ehren Kruger screenplay. The Ring also features the best aerial photography I've seen in any film, even ones outside the genre.  The Ring is a great film, and one that I think will be remembered.",10,0,0,5 November 2002
28 Days Later...," It's Official!
","That does it!  Just the first three years of this decade have produced more good horror films than the entire ten of the nineties.  The nineties had Candyman, Scream, Ravenous, and In the Mouth of Madness, and that was it. There were some good comedies with horror trappings (Tremors, Frighteners. Demon Knight), but those four films were it.  In the last three years, though, we've had Devil's Backbone, Frailty, Session 9, the Others, the Ring, and Audition.  Good stuff.  There has been dreck, including two of the worst horror movies I've ever seen, House of 1,000 Corpses and Feardotcom, but we are really in a renaissance of horror films right now.  28 Days Later continues this good run with an intense, Romero inspired movie with scares, action, and good performances.",Null,0,0,1 July 2003
