Ali," Regardless of the film itself, Will Smith's performance is nothing short of brilliant...
","And I hope those that vote for the Oscars realize that. Regardless of the movie, which I didn't think was bad at all, The Academy Awards are based on performances, and should stay that way. The reason I am talking about The Oscars is because Will Smith was nominated today, along with others for their performances. He deserves the award much more. While the movie became tough to follow and somewhat (yes, only somewhat, it still went by very fast) lengthy, that reflects in no way on Will Smith's incredible performance. He was perfect, and did an excellent job. So regardless of peoples opinions, their 'favorite actor', and the ignorance that swirls around movies like this nowadays because people think so negatively, Oscar or no Oscar, Will Smith gives the performance of 2001.",8,0,0,12 February 2002
Scary Movie 2," Only rent this for Chris Elliott and deleted scenes...
","The only thing remotely funny and entertaining about this movie was the beginning scene with the exorcism, Chris Elliott's scenes, and the deleted scenes. Rent the dvd, watch the movie once to catch Chris Elliott and the beginning scene (if you can bear through it), and check out the deleted scenes for about an hour or so of comedy much better than the movie itself. The movie itself, not that great. 5 out of 10.",5,0,0,27 February 2002
Titanic," It's an embarrassment that this movie is the highest grossing film of all time...
","Yes, I did see it in the theaters, but I was forced. That is exactly how this movie made it's money. Crazed teenage girls. Don't even argue with anyone that says otherwise, this is the reason. This film was absolutely terrible. Sure, it's great for historical reference. NOT! Try renting the original Titanic film, it has a much more entertaining and informative story. This film, rediculous teen movie crap. During the time period that this movie came out, I must have asked all the girls I could find at one point or another what they would do after school. Simple answer. 'Go see Titanic!' These are people dishing out 8 dollars a day to see a film!Not to mention all the boyfriends that were dragged into theaters kicking and screaming by their girlfriends (I know, I was one of them), the adults tricked into thinking this was an Oscar worthy film (which it wasn't) and the terrible story line. How and why did they spend so much money on this film?! How would they know it would gross 600 million rediculous dollars, buying all the people involved new houses and cars??? People must have been paid to see this movie, or say anything positive about it. And then there's the Oscars. Fortunately, the Oscar that Good Will Hunting deserved the most, it got, and that was that of best screenplay. But 11, 11 of the movie businesses most respected awards went to this sorry excuse for a teen movie.Now your saying 'Well, Mr. Big Mouth Know It All, if it was so crappy, then why did so many of these voters vote for the film?' I'm just as clueless as you are, sorry. Wanna know my guess? They were being threatened by their obnoxious 9 year old nieces, or there were mobs of 14 year old girls outside of their houses threatening to give their lawns an uneven mow if they didn't put as many Oscar votes for Titanic as possible. Bottom line, spare yourself the 3 hours of your life you could use for something else. Go watch tomatos grow in a garden. While not as exciting as Titanic (barely much more), it's a much more in depth experience. Or, if you absolutely have to, make sure you spread the word - Titanic is a total embarrassment for the movie world.It's like a big, huge tree, growing right on your nose that you can do nothing about. Since it's made so much money, it is very noticeable, and nothing can be done about it. Terrible, terrible, terrible.",4,4,8,8 February 2002
Signs," An instant classic...
","I have just returned from seeing Signs for the second time, and it is getting to the point where it's initial frightening quality wears off and it makes me think and enjoy it for the classic that it is, and it registers as one of the best horror/thriller films of all time. It ranks for me with the likes of JAWS and The Shining, proving yet again that it's what you can't see that scares you. This is Shyamalan's best work yet, although I have not seen Unbreakable, I'm sure this was better. Anyways, the scares and moments it gives you are so intense, and so breathtaking that it will sweep you right into it's wonderfully written gem of a movie. Shyamalan creates characters that you get to know, love, and care about, and you feel all their emotions along with them all the way. I became pretty sad as the characters did, and happy along with them. This movie is one of the best horror films in existence, and you would be doing yourself a disservice to not see it or listen to any other person that says it's anything other than a masterpiece...",8,0,1,15 August 2002
