Requiem for a Dream," Left at a loss for words...
","The very best movies, in my opinion, are the ones that stir up so many different facets of your thoughts and emotions in such a way that your verbal abilities are left at a loss. That was exactly how I felt after watching this movie, and writing this review the following day, it is somewhat how I feel still. I suppose that in order to give a truly comprehensive review, one that dissects and analyzes all of the wonderful aspects of this movie in the way it deserves, I would need to watch it one or even two more times(which I will probably end up doing anyway). Nevertheless, I will do the best I can.Requiem for a Dream starts, appropriately, at a point in time where all the main characters are pursuing, in one fashion or another, the dreams that they each have for their lives. We are introduced to Sara Goldfarb, a widowed woman who lives alone in Brooklyn, and her son Harry. The movie opens with Harry stealing his mother's television amidst a fight between the two of them. Harry and his mother have their differences, but they clearly love each other dearly. We understand without having to be told that Harry and his friend Tyrone are heavily involved with drugs (heroin in particular), and that Harry's girlfriend Marion is no stranger to them, either. All four of them have goals and aspirations. Sara simply wants to lose weight and look good for an upcoming TV appearance, and as she impatiently waits and obsesses over it, it becomes the central focus and seemingly all she thinks about in her lonely life. Harry and Marion want to open a business someday, and with the money they make from selling heroin, it seems to the viewer that it is well within the realm of possibility. They too, love each other and are supportive of each other's goals. What I realize now is that one reason the movie was so tragic is because each person's dreams are mostly realistic, and could have been realized. Yet as each one of them progressively spirals downward and becomes more and more entangled by the web of their addictions and the damage it causes them, it becomes clear that these fleeting dreams that each of them have will never come to fruition, and yet, through it all, we are still hoping that in some way they will.As each character is slowly destroyed by the choices they have made, they are degraded lower and lower until they are mere faint outlines of what they had once been, not even recognizable to those who loved them, or to the audience. They never stop desiring their dreams, but as the lives they knew come to a catastrophic halt, their dreams become mere wishes. I could say without hesitation that this is probably the best movie I've seen in close to two years, maybe more. It is a movie that shuts you up while you watch it, and it has that effect on you long after it is finished. The camera work, musical score, and acting are all outstanding, which definitely helps the movie to deliver its message.Requiem for a Dream is a sad film, a thought-provoking film, but above all, it is one that deserves careful consideration. Because, it is not merely a film that stirs your emotions and makes you think; it is a film whose lessons can apply to all of us.",10,2,4,30 March 2008
American History X," Wow... just... wow.
","If you decide to watch this movie, be prepared to be struck to the very core of your soul. Very few movies I have seen manage to dig so deep into my heart as this one has, and I am a critical, skeptical, analytical kind of guy---I am about the furthest thing there is from a sappy, ready-to-cry-at-any-time moviegoer!Set in Los Angeles, the story of the movie is that Derek Vineyard (Edward Norton) is sent to prison after a double murder that is motivated by racial hatred. During his three year stay, he undergoes changes and realizes the error of his ways, only to find out that his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is headed down the same path that Derek once was. After getting out on parole, Derek is determined to make sure that Danny does not wind up making the same mistakes as him.Although the movie jumps back and forth from the present (shot in color) to the past (shot in black and white), it is not confusing in the least.This movie grinds and twists your emotions like very few other movies can, because it pulls absolutely no punches as it exposes you to some of the darkest facets of human beings. You'll gasp, you'll cringe and you may even cry as the movie demonstrates to you how warped and vicious human beings can become when they are consumed by anger and hatred---and ultimately, the destruction and horrible endings that that anger and hatred leads to if we cling to them long enough. One last thing---the acting in this movie was phenomenal. Every actor did an astounding job with their character, but I have to mention how off the scales Edward Norton's acting was in this movie. I mean, he has NEVER failed to impress me, but wow... to see him go from a man who is so filled with such high octane rage and hatred, to a man who is consumed by remorse and sorrow as he at last realizes his mistakes, to a much more soft-spoken, reasonable man who is filled with compassion and concern for his younger brother, and at last to a man who is torn apart by agony and grief as he fully realizes what his mistakes have truly cost him... and to play all of it flawlessly... well, I just can't say enough how good of a performance he gave. To see the true consequences of one man's hate, and at the same time, seeing that one man's hate tear apart his family---it's something that is not easily forgotten. This movie teaches why, as Edward Furlong's character puts it, 'hate is baggage'.",10,1,4,3 August 2006
Saw," Pretty original... definitely worth seeing.
","No doubt, today's horror genre is filled to the brim with tired, worn-out clich√©s, predictable plots and settings, and 'scare' attempts that frankly, would put me to sleep faster than a tranquilizer dart to the jugular vein. I'll be honest, I'm not a big horror fan. Usually, the only horror films I REALLY like are the classic masterpieces---The Shining, The Exorcist, Misery, etc. I was much more of a horror fan when I first saw this movie (almost exactly two years ago, when it was in theaters), so the fact that it still retains a certain degree of respect from me and a special place in my heart really says something about it. I'm giving this movie seven stars, although I would give it a 7.5.I have now viewed the entire 'Saw' trilogy---I just watched the latest installment last night. And now, I feel compelled to write reviews for all three films.'How much blood will you shed to stay alive?' was the tag-line for this movie. And indeed, it was applicable in many places throughout the film. Would you hack into the stomach of a living (albeit heavily drugged) person to save your own life? Would you shoot someone you barely knew in order to save yourself and your family? Would you sever one of your own limbs if it was your only means of escape? These are situations that are explored in gruesome detail throughout the movie.The story is that there's a unique serial killer out there who puts unsuspecting hapless souls into desperate situations whereupon, by their own action or inaction, they become victims of some truly gruesome endings. There's a lot of flash-backs and secondary stories, but the main course of the movie involves two men who wake up in what appears to be the scummy remnants of some abandoned restroom, chained by leg shackles on opposite sides of the room. There is a body resting face-down in a pool of blood between them, clutching a revolver and a tape recorder. Both men discover audio tapes in their possession that feature a dark, raspy voice telling them the rules of the 'game', and also warning them of the consequences they face should they fail to fulfill their objectives.Strangely, unlike many horror films involving psychopaths, the mystery of the identity of the killer is not the only thing that keeps us glued to the screen. Of course, we wonder about it (as do the characters on-screen), but many times, it is treated as something of almost secondary importance. This is not to say that the movie doesn't tease us about it, but it relies on much more than a stupid guessing game to keep us interested. As we come to know the characters more and more, we come to sympathize with them, at least to a degree, because the situations they are forced to endure are things that most of us wouldn't wish on our worst enemies.The film doesn't focus so much on the killer and his inner self as it does on the story and lives of the victims. Don't get me wrong---the killer has his places in the movie, but he's more or less a masked phantom figure that chooses only to observe the situations he rigs into place, rather than directly interact with them.In real life, the situations that are masterminded by the killer in this movie (and in the succeeding two films) probably wouldn't play out as smoothly to his liking or prediction as they do. However, that almost goes without saying; in the movie world, the unlikely becomes very plausible.Also, unfortunately, the acting is quite sub-par in certain parts. Cary Elwes, in particular, is kind of... well, lame. There's scenes where the acting makes you go 'Uughh, come ON.' That's the main weakness of the film. If you can withstand those certain scenes of rickety performances though, it's quite easy to enjoy the rest of the film.This movie definitely relies on some of its impact through gratuitous bloodshed---even though it doesn't come anywhere near the level of grotesque gore of the succeeding two installments, that is definitely where some of its ammunition is stocked. Part of it is also the sheer sadistic creativity of the traps that are placed for the characters on-screen. One thing I really like about this film is that it relies on very little of that annoying 'having things pop up on the screen so we can get the highly strung audience members to jump up in their seats' technique. Oh yeah, and part of the impact comes at the end, which features a huge, unexpected twist. Frankly, I thought that said twist was ingenious.In any case, this is definitely a horror film that deserves recognition, because it is certainly far better than many of its competitors, and in a genre that is so filled over-the-top with lame excuses of celluloid crap, that is always a relief.",7,0,1,28 October 2006
Sin City," Visually glamorous and beautifully crafted...
","Sin City is a film that is a mix-mesh of comic book fantasy realm, sharp, striking noir-esquire settings and format, and pure adrenal action that all runs together perfectly. Based on the 'Sin City' graphic novel series by Frank Miller, the film stays amazingly faithful to the source material, while at the same time exercising the freedom to break from the confines of the graphic novel frames and become a movie that stands out from the rest. The film, shot in color and then converted to seductive hi-definition black-and-white (mixed with many objects and settings of glorious colors that jump out from the screen), has a dark, noirish feeling the whole way through and never fails to satisfy. It takes you deep into the psychological wastelands of it's three main characters: Marv (a big, Frankenstein-type guy who's Hell-bent on vengeance), Dwight (a guy with good intentions who is trying to protect a gaggle of prostitutes from enemies ranging from corrupt cops to mob bosses), and Hartigan (an old on-the-verge-of-retirement cop with a heart condition who will do anything to protect an innocent girl from a rapist pedophile, who happens to be the son of a very corrupt senator). The story's characters appear and fall out of each other's lives, much like a Pulp Fiction-type movie. The action and excessive violence, while quite often far-fetched, serves as a nice tool to keep the movie in a fantasy/comic book setting. The dialogue, while not usually top-notch (and on a few conditions a tad cheesy) is delivered well, albeit with a little too much melodrama. Still, the acting is well-done, no actor seems out of place with their character. Perhaps the best thing about Sin City, though, is the fact that, unlike other comic book-movie adaptations, it is not really a comic book-turned-movie; rather, it is more a comic book that, while put on-screen and into the format of a movie, still has the feeling like a comic book the whole way through, even though it has broken past the confines of the graphic novel pages. And is it re-playable? I gotta tell ya, after this movie ended, I wanted to just start it right over and watch it again.",10,1,3,25 June 2006
