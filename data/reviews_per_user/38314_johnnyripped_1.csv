Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What a disappointment!
","As a member of the generation that has pretty much spent most of its collective life waiting for this movie, I must say I am hugely let down. Not only were many of the characters weak, the addition of Jar-Jar was almost infuriating.  The 'Midichlorian' rational managed to lend a prosaic air to one of the most interesting concepts that Star Wars had to offer in the first place.  Finally, I found the virgin birth references to Annakin's conception rather absurd, if only because I think someone already snagged that particular trick. Lucas was probably aiming for the kid audience, but at he expense of the older group that are his most rabid supporters.  I think it is fair to say that he owes us, and that Episode I was a poor pay back.",Null,0,1,22 January 2001
