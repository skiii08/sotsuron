Changeling," Brilliant Performance From Jolie , Eastwood Has Done It Again!
","Every actor /actress whether there good or bad has one role there remembered for. Well this is without a doubt Angelina's. She is sensational.The story is great and true which always makes for a much more interesting watch. It hards to believe at times something like this could have gone on and happened but it did.Eastwood portrays the story as only he could and with all round great performances it nails it!.One of the best things i found with the film was it was so unexpected. Ever plot twist they throw at you , you never see any of them coming. It's quick off the mark and leaves you guessing up until the last second it really has been a while before this since i was so hooked to a movie.Do you need more reason/s to see this film? But there's more. Not only is it great to watch but it looks great. It always amazes me how they make the props/set up for these films look so 30's Los Angeles. It's completely believable and so non fake it's hard to believe what your seeing.It's another one for me that i now relate the story to the film. When i think Johnny Cash i see Jauqin Pheonix because he was so great and believable i almost forget he's not Johhn Cash. Samefor all the actors involved in this one. I straight away think of this film.Overall what your getting is a great film with a great (true) story and the performance of a life time. Definitely top 250 worthy and it's great to finally see it climbing up there!.Also look out for John Malkovich in an equally great role.My Rating : 8/10",8,6,9,19 April 2009
I'm Not There," Phenomenal Performances Make It.
","Just finished watching this film for the second time.It's a pretty good film. I went into the film knowing very very little about Bob Dylan his music and his life. And i feel now i have a much better understanding of this.The films quite slow at times and even more so it's quite boring in parts this is all that lets the film down it's extremely artistic , alternative and unlike anything you'll have seen before but in the process it's boring.But with that in mind it's makes up for it slightly with the fact that after you've watched it feel you've seen something quite special and you feel satisfied!.The acting was oustanding. The film almost feels more of a showcase of talent at times. With the best performances in my opinion coming from Cate Blanchett , Christian Bale and Heath Ledger. It really is some of the best acting i've ever seen Oscar worthy to say the least!.It feels like a lesser version of the wrestler in the sense it's very slow and is more focused on the performances/roles rarther than any story development.To tie it up it could have been a lot better with more thought. But! it was enjoyable even if boring at times and is so different it makes you almost fall in love with it! If you are a film fan like myself and like 'REAL' acting i think you will appreciate this.7/10",8,0,1,21 February 2009
Pirate Radio," A Great Soundtrack , Brilliant Cast & Some Great Laughs Make This A Must See For Rock N' Roll Fans Everywhere.
",Well i think this film has a lot going for it i mean anyone who see's the trailer is pretty much gonna go see it. Firstly it has an all star cast that anyone especially us Brits! are gonna be very familiar with. It's based on an awesome topic that interests again a lot of us Brits and most importantly it looks damn right hilarious!.Unforunatley recent comedy's have proved to show all the laughs they have to offer in the 3 minute trailer then leave you with nothing to see when it comes down to actually watching the film.Well this film is definitely not one of those.The Good Well the film is hilarious anyone who likes anything about comedy will love this which is straight away most people there are some hysterical scenes and enough laughs to keep you going right to the end.Laughs aren't all this film has to offer its actually very appealing to any fans of the rock genre. With it's awesome soundtrack featuring great like The Kinks and The Who and it's real 'stand up for rock n' roll' attitude and storyline for rock fans like myself it's a must see!.One of the other things that is sure to keep you watching is the characters themselves (on the ship). There all very very interesting as well as wacky and just insane!. with some great actors playing them they are extremely believable too which i always think is so important in films you have to believe it!.Phillip Seymour Hoffman that's all i need to say on that one i think we've all come to expect dynamite performances from this guy and on this one he sure as hell delivers it!.To be honest the only negative criticism i can give this one is where were the Beatles there some moments it really needed them and it was set in there days.Aside from that very tiny hicupp this film is one of the best comedy's i've ever seen well worth checking it out.Final Verdict: 8/10,8,6,14,19 April 2009
"I Love You, Man"," This film makes it impossible for the viewer not to enjoy!
","I saw the trailer for this a good six months ago at the cinema and it grabbed me straight away i was looking forward to seeing it. Unfortunately i didn't get time to actually see it so i was then waiting for the DVD release! so i've been waiting to see it for a while, it was worth the wait. One of the things i loved about the film was the plot!. OK so comedy films don't usually feel the need for anything major i guess to an extent that's the point of them. But this film had a new and fresh story to tell. Instead of the usual problems in relationships that get picked on a hundred times a year by Hollywood this one took a new approach. It was about a friendless guy who was struggling to make friends later on in life, a situation i know for a fact a lot of people have been / are in. It wasn't unbelievable at all it was actually quite the opposite. The other quality i thought the film had was perfect casting they all did there jobs well and they couldn't have really picked anyone better to do it!. Segel and Rudd make for an awesome on-screen combo providing big laughs scene after scene. But it's not all just stupid gags (although that is what the film does best) it feels pretty genuine and there are a few lessons in friendship in there, stuff that actually made me think about relationships i have with my own friends. Overall it was one of the most enjoyable films i've seen in a while, it's just a good film in every way it could've been and much more than i expected!. 8/10",8,1,2,12 September 2009
Crash," A Masterpiece & One That Will Live On Forever
","I have seen this movie 3 times now and every time was like the first time again. It really is as close to perfect as movies get. The film is set in LA. There is no better place to set a movie it's so beautiful and simply amazing it's almost like a character in the film. The film explores Racism , Stereotypes and the everyday difficulties faced by people not only in Los Angeles but everywhere in America and beyond. There are so many things that i love about this film i could write pages which is what i fear i might do.None of the actors involved are what anyone would class as even 'good' actors. You've got Sandra Bullock , Brendan Fraser , Matt Dilon and rapper (lucadris) to name just a few. First thing that enters your head hopeless right?. That's exactly what i thought i was wrong. Every actor/actress in this film stepped it up. They all break free from there 'stereotypes' and provide outstanding performances. It is almost like watching a miracle a movie that maybe should never have been that good actually taking on perfection. The actors involved gave it everything. The roles that most of them have been waiting there whole career to be given they just didn't know it. Some die hard Roles they would later go on to nail. You'll never look at people like Matt Dilon for example the same again. 'That idiot out of there's something about Mary right?' this guy earned a whole new level of respect from me in his Oscar worthy portrayal of an LAPD officer with an extremely racist view. The films has some of the most powerful scenes ever used in a film. At times i watched in absolute awe at what was happening on screen and the effect really doesn't wear off over time. The message this film carry's is what it's all about. You pick up on new stuff with every watch. People's racial views are put to the test , things change , people realise , people lose , people win , people find peace. But in the end we are all the same we are all human we all contradict and we all criticise. The film shows that we all care for one another it just sometimes takes tragedy to bring us as close together as we should be. It shows how all of this affects life in good and bad ways in LA. But as before it also says a lot about the world outside of LA. with a perfectly used soundtrack including Bird York's 'In The Deep' and a surprising appearance from the Stereophonics with 'Maybe Tomorrow'. , which help make what are in my opinion are two of the greatest scenes in the history of movies. There is so much to this film that you really have to see it for yourself. It's like i said before 'Perfection' and it's a movie experience that will never leave you.'One Of The Greatest Movies Ever Made'10/10",10,3,9,25 March 2009
American History X," A Truly Amazing Film , Both Norton And Furlongs Finest On Screen Moments.
",I had been told for a few years now this was a great movie i 'had' to see. To be honest i never felt in the mood for it. It just didn't jump out to me. Little did i know it was one of my all time favourites just waiting to be discovered.The story is tremendous. It follows a Neo - Nazi Skinhead whose burning hatred towards the 'black' society (started by his fathers death caused by such individuals) spirals out of control over time. He surrounds himself with fellow followers starts gaining major credit off these followers for his acts almost earning legendary status.He trains and Carry's out small escapades attacking shops and claiming back territory round his home town.Then one night whilst his truck is getting broken into at the peak of his hatred he kills the burglars. Sending him to prison.Whilst he's in prison his brother gets deeper and deeper into the world of black hatred heavily influenced by old friends.Upon leaving prison a changed man Derek seeks to drag his brother out the mindless brainwashing he found himself fall into at the same age.This film is quite simply amazing. The acting is outstanding Norton gives the performance of a life time as does Edward Furlong. I was never a huge fan of Edward Norton before this to tell the truth i found him bland and boring but this opened my eyes to what this guy can do.The story is handled perfectly and slowly builds up to it's shocking finale.the settings are perfect and extremely believable.The dialogue is handled just right as is the level of violence. It is definitely not for the faint hearted there are some pretty nasty and graphic scenes. This is not a 'nice' film. But at the same time it never over does the violence going too over the top.I loved the way it always left in the dark for a while then brought you up to speed later. It let you develop an opinion and then tested it.The flashbacks to Dereks time in prison were a prefect example of this.All in all this a film anyone can and will enjoy.It Carry's a very important message. It shows that racism and hatred are both terrible things and don't get you anywhere they only come back and you and hurt you and the ones you love. It doesn't get you anywhere.It shows we're all human beings regardless and we all capable of evil regardless of our colour or race.The world is huge and destined to be united.One of my favourite films definitely in my top 50.9/10,9,0,2,30 March 2009
Dog Day Afternoon," 'So what country do you want to go to? Wyoming!'
","'Dog Day Afternoon' tells the story of two men who attempt an armed robbery on a Brooklyn bank.But there's so much more to it then that!. Pacino plays (Extremely well) Sonny he comes across quite cool to start with but this guy hasn't got a clue what the hell he's doing. He mucks up, he's nervous , he has no plan , he hasn't even a clue!.Of course he's not alone along with him is his good friend who also doesn't know what to do next. Sonny describes him as the trigger guy 'i bark , he bites' but is he really such a tough nut?Well that should get you started without ruining anything.First off Pacino's performance in this film is great it has to be up there with some of my all time favourite roles.The story is gripping and exciting to say the least and is even further backed up by the fact that it's true. Which always make the film more satisfying!.Every aspect of the movie is so simply amazing. Every line, every action every quote it's just simply put a great movie.I loved the way the seriousness of the situation was so often played down as if it were a tea party!. Even a lot of the people being held 'hostage' didn't take these guys serious. It threw in a lot of sneaky comedy perfectly played off and emphasised by Pacino this guy can be really funny!.I also loved the way the situation began to pan out with Sonny becoming some what of a hero at one point and gaining almost 'celebrity status' and loving it.But this all helps take your eyes off the ball 'the seriousness of the situation' and completely shocks you when consequences are met by the 'robbers'. You have to see it to know what i mean so i'll leave it there.I think most people can enjoy this movie and i think most will.Give it a chance you never know the same thing might happen to you you might love it, definitely in my top 75-ish movies i've ever seen.9/10",9,1,2,3 March 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," An Enjoyable Watch For All!
",Saw this movie in my local 'Odeon' cinema this past Sunday.Now i had extremely high expectations for this one and it didn't quite live up to them. This is not to say it wasn't a good film as from my rating you can see i gave it an eight it was a brilliant film just not quite as gripping or 'amazing' as a lot of other people seem to have thought.The story is obviously the highlight it really is beautiful and the director and the actors involved all helped portray it in the best possible way they could to be honest which was not an easy task. This really was a film that could have been easily screwed up but it wasn't! Pitt and Blanchett's performances were great from Pitt playing a small wrinkly young man! to some really brilliant scenes involving the both of them together.The film has quite a few 'emotional' parts portrayed in the story and 80% of the time they work. There are other times some of the scenes i felt didn't really pack a strong enough punch and you didn't really feel any sort of emotion towards anyone involved.I seem to have said this about a lot of films of late but it's true it ran at 3hours 10 minutes including the usual ridiculous promotion before the film gets going but like the staff promised us before entering this film it will not bore you nor does it drag on it really is a pleasure to watch. It really is the sort of film that is halfway to being a masterpiece a lot more could have been done to secure it's place in film history but to be honest it could have been a bad film and it certainly was not that.I feel a few of the category's it has been nominated in at the Oscars it deserves to win.Overall it's a wonderful film with a great story backed up with some outstanding performances. Go in with no expectations and it might be one of your all time favourites. I wish i had not grown such high expectations of the film as i might have enjoyed it further. However a second time round i feel is one day in order! 8/10,8,8,11,9 February 2009
The Dark Knight," Possibly the greatest movie i've ever seen!
","Well where do i begin! I've been excited about seeing this film since seeing the trailer back towards the start of the year and being a big fan of the batman movies my expectations were extremely high. I went to see the film the weekend it came to cinemas and was worried it wouldn't live up to my expectations nor the hype surrounding it. But wow! i never expected it to ever be as good as it was. The story was outstanding and for a batman film actually quite complicated there were a lot of twists and turns and you never knew what was coming next. As with the acting it was phenomenal best performances being from Micheal Caine , Aaron Eckart , Garry Oldman and of course Heath Ledger who played what in my opinion was not only the best on screen villain of all time but quite possibly the best role in a film ever. This combined with some amazing memorable scenes and in parts this film is hilarious mostly delivered from Bale and Ledger and the occasional tip of the hat from freeman!. Although there was a tremendous amount of big names in here it was done brilliantly giving them all decent time in the film. And although the film ran at roughly 2 and a half hours you never wanted it to end for one second. Action fans need not worry as there are some out of this world action scenes and although this film isn't a full on action movie when the ball starts rolling it really makes up for it. I feel like no matter how much i write i could never sum up this film in full i had to see it twice! and it only got better with time. Heath has to win an Oscar for this and to be honest this film deserves a few in other areas. And watch out for the ending! wow even had people in tears throughout the cinema has got to be one of the most powerful endings ever. For me the best thing about the film was the story itself pure genius the concepts and ideas and some of the most memorable and well thought out lines and scenes ever. This film appeals in my opinion to anyone and everyone from young children all the way upto older folks and you don't necessarily have to be a big batman fan to enjoy this gem. Watch out with the kids though as this a very dark film and has scenes and ideas which may frighten younger children *****",10,4,9,2 August 2008
Taken," Fast Paced Edge Of The Seat Action - Thriller.
","Grab a dramatic storyline , some awesome action sequences and a determined father (played only as Liam neeson could) and you have 'taken'.It really is a great movie.The film follows Bryan ex - spy. He has moved to Los Angeles to be closer to his daughter. He has some lost time to make up for. But When his daughter(Kim) goes on a trip abroad to Paris and is kidnapped by professionals who steal young girls and force them into the sex/slave trade he takes on a new objective to get his daughter back!.This film is straight to the point there is no messing about and it really lets you know that Bryan knows exactly what he's doing he knows what to do instantly.Neeson is brilliant as 'Bryan' in the film and to be honest really makes the film what it is. With some outstanding hand to hand combat and awesome kick ass dialogue this could well be one of neesons finest moments on the screen.The film is very realistic and very gritty. It's not afraid to go right out and show you how real this situation is. With plenty of guts and blood it will satisfy anyone who is a fan of the action genre. And at the same time it creates the perfect blend of action to drama and will satisfy anyone who loves there films with a bit of drama. I guess you could say it's a thriller.The settings are all spot on and really captures the gloomy rough terrains of Paris in comparison to the sunshine state! that is California. This really makes it stand out that they are not at home!.It's like a ticking bomb throughout it puts you into the film. Every minute that goes by is a minute closer to something happening to Kim and the difference between Bryan either finding or not finding his daughter before it's too late. You really are on the edge of your seat throughout and you don't move from there until the credits role the film is so unpredictable and you don't see anything coming. It has to be one of the fastest paced action movies or movies for that natter that i have ever seen and i loved it.It doesn't ever get boring or drag on in fact it's bad that it had to end!. It keeps it short and sweet.Overall it has to be one of the best films i've seen in quite a while and definitely one of my favourite action movies.A solid 9/10 from me.",9,1,2,3 April 2009
Blade Runner," A Sci - Fi Epic
","Blade Runner.Well what can i say 'one of the greatest sci - fi movies ever made' true.'awesome performances' true.I could go on all day it is simply amazing and never short of breath taking.The movie is about a company who have gone into making replicants. These are used as slaves to work off land. But when one goes 'crazy' you could say and commits murder they are banned from earth. Punishment for them being there is death or 'retirement'! then comes the best bit you have 'Deckard' who works for the LAPD's blade runner unit. Blade Runner is the name given to those who hunt down and kill these replicants.'Deckard' is then forced out of his retirement to eliminate six replicants on earth.And so the adventure begins.Ridley Scott is a genius it is almost like he looked into the future and made this movie to stand the test of time because it really does it like no other movie of it's time it doesn't feel old and worn out , it's still so fresh and new and most importantly exciting to new viewers.Ford and Hauer on top form acting wise both giving powerful performances through out this masterpiece and only ever adding more to the viewing pleasure.Throw in some truly iconic scenes handled , spun off and done so well it is almost like watching perfection in it's purest form.The film is done so well. Film's need to leave good remembrance they need to hit hardest in the final moments and this film sure does just that. It has one of my favourite all time endings and i wouldn't change a second of it.The look , the acting and everything used in this film is done amazingly it's outstanding and more so its enjoyable to no end.Only thing is i have seen and own the 'directors cut' and have read up on the ongoing talks/mentions of the various other versions and have heard this is the least impressive so i MUST get round to seeing the other versions. If this is one of the lesser versions and i loved it this much well!.Everyone has to see this movie no doubt.9/10",9,0,1,13 March 2009
Munich," Extremely Exciting , Suspense Filled , Perfectly Paced ... I Could Go On!
","Munich tells the story of 11 Isralie Athlete murdered when a hostage operation doesn't exactly go as planned. The Group of people behind it were/are known as 'Black September'.What the film really focuses on is everything that came after this event. In response to this a new attitude/ approach is taken it is decided by the Isrealie government that the best way to change things to fight back is to start doing some of the killing themselves. So it is decided that a team shall be put together with the intention of finding and killing the people responsible for the slaughtering of the athletes. Chosen to lead the team is Avner the son of a once war hero who has to agree to leave his life which is taken up mostly by his pregnant wife for a while and focus on the objective in hand he can not tell anyone about this and will be given four other team members in which to carry out his 'work'. Well what happens after all this is quite simply amazing and shown so well by Spielberg. The film shows the consequences of the attitude 'fighting fire with fire' It shows how over time the men doing the revenge killing almost can't handle it and lose there eagerness to kill back. It shows how this affects you , others around you and even sometimes people who don't deserve to die. The film almost spells out that killing gets you nowhere and doesn't change nor right wrongs. What the film also does is shows that the men doing the hunting down for those responsible ultimately become the hunted in a world were information can and will be sold to whoever will pay the most. It shows how even after the mission is over Avner is affected by what has happened he is scared as he is now a man wanted and is scared for him and his family's life. This film is full of edge of the seat stuff! and is ram packed full of suspense. Even at it's long running time not for one second is this film slow and never manages to drag in anyway!With amazing performances from Bana and the other four members of the team including 'Daniel Craig' this film is for anyone who just generally loves movies. It has no particular target audience and can be enjoyed by all. Everything in this film just feels so perfect the Cinematography , Performances , Action , Handling of violence and how real it feels in general!.It's one that all lovers of both drama and action movies will enjoy and makes you wonder what more Spielberg could have mastered if he had opted for more serious movies like this. 8/10",8,2,3,5 February 2009
True Romance," Memorable Scenes , A Great Plot & Enough Big Names To Run Multiple Movies!
","Been waiting to see this one for a while and finally did about a week ago now.Well first off 'True Romance' is simply great. It has a lot going for it in the form of a great plot , awesome performances outstanding actors and some good action scenes among many other things!.I just loved every second of it it oozed with style. You really can tell Tarantino write this one. It has his name all over it.Christian Slater gives easily his best performance as does Patricia Arquette.Every scene , every line , every action is so perfect!. It's actually quite hard to explain without making someone sit and watch it.My favourite performances were those of Gary Oldman, Slater , Arquette and Walken.This film does not hold back it's full on when the violence is rolling and you can't help but love it!.That's all i'm gonna say JUST WATCH IT!8/10",8,0,0,8 March 2009
