Catch Me If You Can," ZZZzzzzzzzzz
","Im sorry, but this movie was beyond boring and way too dumb to take seriously. Over 2 hours of nothing. How can you drag out something as pointless as running around writing bad checks? Um yeah, because everything presented in the movie could really happen right. Dont believe the hype, a stinker through and through.",1,10,31,28 January 2003
The Polar Express," A Complete Train Wreck
","What an abysmal piece of trash. This is nothing but a lame attempt to use Hanks as a vehicle to cash in on some new 'technology'. The film is a total dud. Dumb, boring, annoying, irritating...I mean everyone looks like a freakin' mannequin, but oh wait, they MOVE realistically. So amazing. Too bad the novelty wears off in what, the first minute?The train is filled with the most annoying bunch of kids you'll ever hear. There is absolutely NO PLOT whatsoever, just a train riding around with some stupid obstacle getting in the way every 5 minutes so they can show off more of that amazing new technology. Pad this out to 90 minutes and you have TPE. The movie is so beyond hurting, I mean we're forced to sit through singing and dancing waiters for what? So things can move on screen really fast and we can be even more stunned by those amazing visuals? Its like they just threw anything and everything out there to get this to feature length.Tom Hanks is as awful as ever. I mean the guy has zero range. Every movie he's the exact same no matter how hard he tries, even his voice as a conductor is unbelievable. I'm so glad this is flopping because its not a movie, its a pathetic attempt by Hanks and some computer geeks to milk people. Next time give us a movie instead of a showcase of your computer coding. One of the worst of the year.",2,31,72,4 December 2004
Seabiscuit," utter garbage
","sorry folks, but the movie sucked big time.  people really need to get over themselves, like Im so tired of everyone using ebert or the critic's take so to speak to rationalize the fact that they either cant think for themselves, or have terrible taste. this is honestly as bad as any hollywood explosion flick, if not worse. worse because it tries so so SO hard, and it so painfully obvious, yet the 'mature' viewer supposedly is able to appreciate it. ha!How exactly is this a good movie? It's not even watchable! The most nothing story told in the most uninteresting way possible...ugh, it was even lamer than gosford park.  Such flat charaterizations.... women: 'hi' man  ' 'hi, blah blah blah' women  'blah blah blah blah' man 'do I know you?' ...groan. that is an actual snippet of the soap opera cornball dialogue that makes up seabiscuit, but or course, people that 'liked' the movie will tell you its a brilliant character piece. er, ok. believe me, you'll be more than just rolling your eyes while trying to take this nonsense in. not to mention the annoying, dare I say volatile editing. scenes that have no relation to anything, pointless conversations, jumping around timewise with no care for resolving anything brought up, geez, I needed a dramamine just to make it through this thing! I tried so hard to get into this but it just wasn't happening and I absolutely refuse, REFUSE to believe there are people out there who didn't think 'what the hell is this?' at least a dozen times during this movie, hell during the first 30 minutes alone! sorry, but forcing yourself to sit through rubbish in an attempt to appreciate a 'good' film is just wrong. if we all had that mentality crap like titanic would be in the top 250.The emperor is naked folks, and it sure aint pretty.",1,7,23,29 August 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," For Immature Minds Only
","After wanting to see this for nearly 2 decades I finally got around to watching it...pathetic. First off, I actually did feel excited during the yellow bordered title sequence, I mean the theme music kicked in and I thought I was really in for a something special. My God was I wrong. This film is unwatchable. We have this tin can going around beeping every friggin two seconds. Easily the most annoying thing I've ever had to endure since seeing Julie Andrews (a grown woman btw) actually skipping while singing a song about confidence in the Sound Of Music. Then the dialogue sets in and let me tell you, I've never in my life heard anything so juvenile. Like I cant even revert my brain back far enough to an age where this dialogue would seem even remotely interesting, fantastic, or fun. The whole movie, script, costumes, story is just one tacky, immature mess that absolutely stunned me in its awfulness and I'm being completely serious. Turkey/5 Recommended for fans of Sesame Street, bandwagons, and all things overrated.",1,42,123,5 September 2004
