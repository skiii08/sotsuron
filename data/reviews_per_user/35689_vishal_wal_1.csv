Catch Me If You Can," DiCaprio does it again with Spielberg this time.
","The movie is just brilliant and is one of best flick I've seen till date. Dicaprio is brilliant and Tom hanks is very good. The movie has all the elements of a good movie. A tight plot, socially responsible handling of an otherwise psyche-corruptible story, beautiful performances by abganale Sr. and Jr. and a tight direction by Spielberg. The movie doesn't go off track not even for a single second and ends at an appropriate point. The jock, which frustrated Tom Hanks narrates to his peers is just too much. Movie has Spielberg humor, Spielberg pace and Spielberg commitment. The scene in which Dicaprio takes off on an air plane and hanks watches the aero plane is a very difficult scene to direct but is shot so smoothly that it doesn't even attract the attention. The movie is just great. I would give 9 because only movies like Anand and Guide(Hindi) and My Cousin Vinny and The Truman Show (English) gets 10 on 10.",9,2,3,26 December 2004
