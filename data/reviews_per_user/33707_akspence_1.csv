Hereditary," Plot seemed to lack direction
","This is one of those rare movies where the plot gets worse, not better as the movie continues. It started out promising and had a few bright spots of keeping your attention in parts of the movie, but all in all it was sort of a silly movie and a very dumb ending.",4,0,0,24 March 2019
