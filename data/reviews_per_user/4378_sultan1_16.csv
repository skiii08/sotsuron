The Mask," 'NO, IT WASN`T ME! IT WAS THE ONE-ARMED MAN!
","Yes Mr. Carrey it was you that made us die laughing in this delightfully entertaining film not the one armed man. This is a very unique movie and could be Carrey`s best work (but i will leave it up to you to decide that). Although i don`t think the Mask is quite as good as Dumb and Dumber, but it is very close. As i watched this movie i saw myself in the 'mask' character. Come on hasn`t every guy felt like the mask after seeing a beautiful girl walking by or maybe after downing a few beers or perhaps a combination of the two! So their 'may be' a bit a a wild man in all of us, but that is what makes this film so entertaining! And i liked watching Stanley and Tina deal with his wild side which all of us must do at some point in our lives. At any rate this movie is worth a look and does have high entertainment value to it, and i do recommend it to Jim Carrey fans. rating (best of 5 stars).....3.....",Null,0,0,27 March 2000
The Mummy," 'rescue the damsel in distress,kill the bad guy,save the world'
","Well Brendan Fraser may not be the hero Indiana Jones is but he does accomplish all of the above with style. This movie is entertaining and i can understand why it did so well at the box office however when i watched this movie i couldn`t tell if it was action/adventure or comedy meets horror or is it horror meets comedy, as they 'tried' to put some humor in this film but fell a little short on making me laugh! The plot is pretty basic- mummy comes back to life, terrifies everyone, tries to save his mummy girlfriend and dies in the end. Thank God the incredible special effects make this sound or should i say look much better than it is!! This film is good but i think it could have been a little better as far as the theme goes. To sum it up, if your looking for a fun movie that has a little bit of action, adventure, horror, and very little comedy in it (ha ha) then check it out. But if you`re looking for a classic horror film called 'The Mummy' you might want to keep searching.  rating (best of 5 stars) .....3.....",Null,0,0,3 April 2000
Forrest Gump," To sum it up in one word 'CLASSIC'
",This movie is very good. To this day I still consider it as one of the best movies ever made. If I ever have grand kids this is the movie I want to watch with them. This movie can be passed down from generation to generation and people of all ages will still love it!! It`s too bad some of the critics don`t know a classic when they see it.  Rating (best of five stars)...5.,Null,1,4,18 March 2000
Good Will Hunting," 'YOU`RE SITTING ON A WINNING LOTTERY TICKET'
","When Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this movie they didn`t know they were 'sitting on a winning lottery ticket' but they had a good feeling it was!! Thank God they were`nt to wimpy 'to cash it in' because this is a great movie. To many movies come out that just don`t have what GWH has. Although i can`t call it a classic (mainly because their is to much profanity in it), the movie is still worth seeing atleast 2 or 3 times. The language problem is most likely the reason this film didn`t win an academy award for best picture. Despite this flaw in the movie it`s still one of the best films of the 90`s. I know they were trying to make it more like real life with the swearing but not even construction workers and sailors put together swear that much. If you can get passed this part of the movie you will find a great film that has excellent acting and a fantastic story that you don`t see in alot of movies out their. rating (best of 5 stars) .....4.....",Null,0,2,24 March 2000
Amadeus," 'I CANT THINK OF A TIME WHEN I DIDN`T KNOW HIS NAME'
","After i saw this movie i knew i would never forget his name!! This is a spectacular movie, from start to finish it draws you into the Story and i mean that with a capital 'S' this movie actually has a great story to it unlike some movies out their that just don`t have any substance to them. However, now that i think about it this movie would make alot of movies look bad. Yes it`s that good and is a definite classic among people that may or may not like classical music or the clothes they wore back then. But before i saw this film i didn`t like any of these things either, but that has changed now, thanks to the entire cast and crew of Amadeus!! rating.....5.....",Null,2,4,24 March 2000
Dumb and Dumber," very funny
",This comedy has future classic written all over it! Jim Carey is a master at this type of humor!! Some people may not like it because of it`s 'dumb' humor but that is why they named the film Dumb and Dumber..Their are some scenes in this film that still make me crack up!! Very very funny stuff. rating (best of 5 stars) .....3.....,Null,1,1,22 March 2000
Groundhog Day," 'I`M A GOD. I`M NOT *THE* GOD.. I DON`T THINK'
","BillMurray may not be a god, but in some ways this movie makes him immortal. I`m not saying this film is a classic but it is Bill Murray`s best work. This film is very entertaining,and can be viewed several times without getting tired of it. But as far as it being a classic let`s just say no,mainly for two reasons the story just doesn`t have enough depth to it to really enthrall the viewer. Second, people for the most part don`t care for scrooge like characters unless it`s a certain christmas story that i won`t mention, although Bill Murray seems to fit this character rather well, i still can`t say it`s a classic,like some of the other critics do??? Overall this movie is good and has high entertainment value and is very funny at times,i did like it and i would recommend it to Bill Murray fans and to anyone that enjoys a good comedy. rating (best of 5 stars).....3.....",Null,0,0,24 March 2000
The Waterboy," 'NOW THAT`S WHAT I CALL HIGH QUALITY H20'
",Sad to say but low quality H20 is better than this film. Sandler offers another poor performance in this movie. This is huge 'B' movie trash. Don`t contaminate your brain cells with it!! The only movie i like with Sandler is happy gilmore. But even happy gilmore is pretty sad. rating (best of 5 stars) .....1.....,Null,1,1,24 March 2000
Final Destination," intense!!
","this movie is very intense and the action is VERY different from other action/thrillers that i`ve seen in the past. some people may not like all the violence in this film however this movie is basicly about death. this film may cause some of us to never 'fly' again just like the movie psycho (1960) caused some people to stop taking showers for awhile, this movie has the same effect! if your into thriller movies or horror movies this is a must see, however i would not recommend 'Final D' for anyone that is easily offended by profanity or for anyone that has a weak stomach or a weak heart as i stated before this film is very intense. the acting and the plot may be a little weak but still the movie is worth a look! rating (best of 5 stars)......3.....",Null,0,0,8 July 2000
The Matrix," 'out of this world action'
","When one watches this movie he/she must stop and think what a reality he believes they live in!! Yea that`s right his whole life is a cybergenetic creation. But now it`s time to turn the table on the enemy. Overall this movie is very entertaining and well thought out, the Wachowski brothers demonstrate a stroke of genius in this film. However their are a few things i didn`t like about it, first being Keanu Reeves. I really don`t care for his acting that much, he`s like the frankenstein of hollywood. He is so 'stiff' this guy doesn`t know the meaning of expression. He`s got the same look on his face the whole movie. And what is with those guys with the stupid sunglasses on?? Their like something out of a bad 'B' movie. And last if you don`t know much about computers or virtual reality this movie is hard to follow. Other than the little things this movie is worth seeing, Despite the poor acting from Reeves it`s still very good, thanks to the directors!! rating (best of 5 stars) .....3 1/2.....",Null,0,0,21 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," 'GREAT SHOT KID THAT WAS ONE IN A MILLION'
","Well when George Lucas took his shot at this movie he may not have known it would turn out to be one in a million but this film went way beyond that. He may not have known that all sci-fi movies would be measured by it. But as it stands today this is the best sci-fi movie ever made and all future sci-fi movies will be compared to it!! I remember when this movie first came out, i was about 7 years old and it was so fascinating to me to see Luke Skywalker with his light saber and the millennium falcon zipping through space at light speed, and the other colorful characters that make up this remarkable film were great too. Another good thing about this movie is you don`t have to be a kid to enjoy it. This movie is a classic and will go down in history as one of the best movies ever made. As far as the sequels go i don`t think their as good as this one but they are very good. rating (best of 5 stars).....5.....",Null,0,0,23 March 2000
Ran," no comment!!!
","this movie is pitiful!! I can`t figure out why so many people like it?????? I guess if you`re into japanese history or samurai warfare you might like it.. however i like war movies and japanese history but this movie is terrible. I couldn`t stand watching that old man running around acting crazy this has got to be the worst scene ever recorded on film, and all the corny philosophy in the movie gets old real fast. A movie like this could be great if it had better acting and better war scenes!! but even the war scenes are horrible. Nothing can save this film!! rating (best of 5 stars).....1.....",Null,3,10,14 April 2000
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," 'YOU ARE A VAMPIRE WHO NEVER NEW WHAT LIFE WAS UNTIL IT RAN OUT IN A BIG GUSH OVER YOUR LIPS'
","Lestat knew his prey would become his companion, but his prey did not know this. This film digs down into the core of what it would be like to travel the world as a vampire. This movie in some ways reminds me of a different horror film called Mary`s Shelley`s Frankenstein both films draw you into the minds of the characters, it`s not just blood and guts and 'sudden' things to scare you but rather it`s an examination of the evil minds and hearts of the characters!! This is my favorite type of horror!! Although I really can`t compare this movie to the book because i never read it, so i can only judge this film as a fan of horror movies. And i must say this is one of the best vampire type movies i`ve seen. It really is very creepy and sends chills up and down your spine. And i really liked Kirsten Dunst`s character, have you ever seen such a cute little vampire in your life?? Anyways, if you`re into horror movies this is a must see. And if you like it, check out Mary shelley`s frankenstein it`s another one that will send chills up and down your spine, also if you know of any movies that are like these two email me. rating (best of 5 stars).....3 1/2.....",Null,0,1,8 April 2000
Braveheart," 'the best war scenes ever'
","o.k. it has the best war scenes ever put on film, but how good is the movie, let me just say it`s very good but not outstanding, this film falls short on being a classic but hits a home run in the action/war category. I don`t want to take anything away from this film because the acting is good and the story is somewhat interesting, but the movie is just to long. During the movie i kept asking myself when is this going to end?? However if your into the 'art of war' as i am and you have almost 3 hours to spare (most of us don`t though) then don`t miss this movie, but if war movies are not your forte` then i would suggest that you choose another movie to watch. rating (best of 5 stars) .....3 1/2.....",Null,0,0,23 March 2000
Gladiator," 'FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE ABOUT TO DIE, SALUTE YOU'
","yes! This movie lives up to it`s name!! You almost feel like your a Roman spectator at the coliseum watching the games!! The costumes and scenery seem very realistic to that time in history. And the battle scene at the beginning of the movie is one of the best battle scenes i`ve ever seen, in fact it might be better than the battle scenes in braveheart, it`s very very close!! the acting is good, and this movie should win atleast one award. The only thing that might keep this movie from winning best picture is all the gore. So if you have a weak stomach don`t watch this movie, but if your into this type of action i highly recommend it. rating (best of 5 stars).....4.....",Null,0,0,6 May 2000
High Fidelity," good soundtrack, bad movie!!
","this movie starts out slow and just stays like that. through out the movie i was hoping it would get better but it never did. the characters are not believable at all!! this could be one of the worst films ever made!! and it`s really a pity because i like all the actors in it but the story and the characters are just so bland and fake that it`s insulting to my intelligence that people produce trashy films like this?? the film might appeal to the mindless masses but when all is said and done it`s just 'B' movie garbage!! what really makes this film bad is Cusack`s character, he`s always talking directly into the camera and telling a story instead of just letting it unfold like normal movies do?? really a pitiful movie!! rating (best of 5 stars) .....1.....",Null,0,1,11 July 2000
