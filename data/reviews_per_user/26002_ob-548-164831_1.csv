Skyfall," Skyfall? just a let down!
","I've never reviewed a film before. BUT 40 odd years ago I saved my pocket money to see Dr NO. Seen all the Jimmy Bondo's since and enjoyed all the incarnations. BUT NEVER BEFORE SO DISAPPOINTED! and until now I thought Daniel Craig was Bond embodied! He should be so sad!This was hyped as Bond back to moody and hard. BUT incredible action matched incredible plot! OK... with Bond some edge of the seat stuff is mandatory. But to 'bond' with BOND, the action must have some believability and complement a catchy Plot - here the action so obviously led the plot. The greatest depth came at the bottom of the opening action waterfall!Moody was me...dis-pleasured by a cartoon of a film heaving with risible moments and silly scripting. I finally gave up all tolerance of American driven drivel when Bond was offered his father's old 'hunting rifle' - unfortunately by an otherwise canny character - the old Scottish retainer. It was a shot gun....SHOT GUN! Rifles and shot guns are quite different things - a credible Bond would know this! AND in Scotland one either shoots or stalks - never HUNTS! (groan...head in hands....) And Skyfall? - that's a believable name for an old Scottish estate of course....? Sad old Bond... even leading ladies led nowhere.... As for the villain... what a paper character of convenience - which is where he should have been confined or flushed away and never trotted out.I only go to see 4-5 films a year - very selective. This is the first time ever I would have liked my money back - money back is unfortunately what the franchise guarantees Mendes - more mendicus for amends methinks than a Bond-myth master.",5,32,65,6 December 2012
