Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny movie, but man did he find a lot of bigots!
","I just watched this movie on DVD and it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. But it leaves my wondering how the rest of the world will view us after it. Sacha Baron didn't really have to look very hard, but he still found some of the most ignorant bigots in America for a bunch of his scenes. I have always hated rednecks because of their blind views on life, but now people all over the world are going to think all Americans are like these people. One man Borat found at a rodeo, went into a rant on how anyone with darker skin should shave their mustache, so they won't be viewed as terrorist. The same man went on to proclaim how people like him are trying to get homosexuals hung from a rope until they are death, just for being born gay. At the very same rodeo Borat praised America and hoped Bush would be able to drink the blood of the people from Iraq, which in turned, caused the crowd to clap and hoot in pride! How sad is it that we live in the greatest country on earth, but those who will only know about America from the bigots they see in this movie, for those people, the image of America will be of hate. Like I said before, I love this movie. It incorporates the right amount of script and improve. It is sad though, that the main thing that stands out, is that there is still Americans who are so blind to evolution, blind to the workings of the human mind, blind to any kind of acceptance, that will hoot and holler at the thought of a simpleton president, drinking the blood of people living in chaos. You can rag on me for bashing these people, but come on! We need to get past all of this bull ****! And seeing the rednecks in this movie, just make me feel so ashamed to live in the same great country as they do.Great movie, but I think people from other places that see it, will think all of us are that stupid.",10,2,12,10 March 2007
