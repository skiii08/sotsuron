The Blair Witch Project," Where is the plot?
","I went to see this movie because I have heard that I was 'the best horror movie ever made'; that, without a big budget with special effects, it really made you panic. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! I kept looking at my watch all the time. This movie doesn´t have any plot at all, the actors spend half of the time crying and the rest of it blaming each other for their terrible luck and yelling each other. The worst thing is that they are 'playing' with a home-video camera, and they don´t really know how to use it (they keep pointing at the ground, then at the sky, then at the ground again...without even focusing), so after 15 minutes you feel kind of dizzy.I don´t know how this movie made so much money: probably, because they made a great web page, and everybody said 'Let´s go see it, they haven´t spent much money...'If you don´t want to bore yourself, check for another movie.",1,2,4,2 July 2000
The Matrix," Fantastic!!
","Great movie! I went to see it thinking that, like some recent movies, I would only see good special effects. I was wrong. Matrix has, more than nothing, an incredible sci-fi plot. It may seem kind of bizarre but, at the end, everything has sense. I am sure this film will set a 'before and after' in sci-fi movies.",9,0,0,2 July 2000
