The Blair Witch Project," 'Eeriest' rather than 'scariest' movie ever made
","Has there ever been so much hype for such a low-budget film? This film may have gotten a bigger push than any other low-budget movie in cinematic history, and in the end I believe it was hurt by this.Not only was it being billed as 'the scariest movie ever' but there were also rumors that these events actually occurred, and the film had been pieced together from actual footage (which is not true, of course). Whether or not the legend is real, I don't know, but it seemed real enough, where one might believe it actually happened. I felt the three actors involved were practically flawless, giving some of the most realistic performances I have ever seen; the fact that they ad-libbed all their lines must have helped them in this respect, but nonetheless they were excellent.The problem I had with the film is that it isn't scary enough; there were more scenes where I found myself laughing than feeling scared, which was not the intent of the directors. It WAS eerie, I have no qualms about that, but it had the potential to be terrifying without wandering into the realm of 'campiness,' and with a little more substance than innuendo it would have truly been a masterpiece (perhaps if they heard chanting at night instead of the all encompassing wood-snapping sound it would have been more effective at conveying the intense fear the characters must have felt which, judging by people's comments around me after it was over, was not accomplished). What is meant to be inferred or imagined is almost always more frightening than anything that can be portrayed on screen, but even the subtleties were TOO subtle, and they should have been a bit more graphic.The conclusion of the film was terrifying and it wasn't until then that I felt truly frightened. There is something intrinsically creepy about the woods, but I think the film-makers relied to much upon that assumption.",8,1,1,1 August 1999
Unbreakable," believable superhero
","If there was such a thing as a 'superhero,' this is the most plausible, realistic idea about what he might be like.  David Dunn has no special powers, nor is he invincible , but his physiological make-up allows his body to withstand much greater physical forces than average human beings. This concept is much easier to accept than someone with x-ray vision or the ability to fly (although superman is more sci-fi/fantasy while 'Unbreakable' is more of a drama).I did not enjoy 'The Sixth Sense'. In fact, I hated it. Nor do I read comic books (although the trailer doesn't convey the connection). Despite this, I could not wait to see 'Unbreakable,' and much to my delight I found it to be very absorbing and thought-provoking, although not at all what I expected.Watching this film a second time, I noticed all the 'clues' and visual images that hint towards the ending, an ending with which many people have said they are unsatisfied.  I agree to a certain extent.  The ending could have been a bit more profound, but considering this movie is modeled after a comic book in which the hero discovers his powers, I thought it was appropriate.My only hope is that the release of the DVD includes deleted scenes showing more of David Dunn discovering his strength.",Null,1,1,4 December 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Where's the Beef?
","Maybe it's just me, but I feel a film needs an ending to be considered complete.  I realize this is the first installment of a trilogy, but the film should be able to stand on its own, and this clearly does not.Since an ending can clearly 'make' an otherwise ordinary film such as 'Usual Suspects,' shouldn't a lack of an ending break a film? I think, ultimately, this is what has caused this movie to struggle so mightily to reach $300m in gross sales.",1,3,10,22 March 2002
American Beauty," superb performances elevate movie above plot
","Had it not been for Hillary Swank's unbelievable performance in 'Boys Don't Cry,' Annette Benning surely would have won 'Best Actress' as this was possibly one of the best performances in the past decade. Kevin Spacey, confirmed by his oscar, also did a superb job. But strong performances are not the only elements of a masterpiece, and this film lacks certain qualities or attributes that would elevate it to that status.Despite the humor and irony, this film is quite perverse, not necessarily because of Lester's obsession with a teenager but because almost EVERY scene involves dialogue that centres around sex (and it is often quite vulgar). Had it not been so unrelenting, I would not be bothered by this, but we are bombarded with crude dialogue throughout the entire film.This is something I did not notice the first time I saw 'American Beauty'. However, watching for a second time, I couldn't help but feel that it was overdone and inappropriate.  Had it been a bit more subtle it would have been perfect, but it was too much.Next time you watch this movie, try to take notice just how often there are crude references or sexual images.  Normally I have no problem with such things in a film, but in one so lauded and praised, I had a hard time understanding the appropriateness.Concerning the plot, I was eerily reminded of a Seinfeld episode gone awry. Such misunderstandings would not occur in real-life because people would not behave in the way these characters did. Although the character Lester might be easily related to by many men (and maybe women too, I don't know, I can't really speak for them) the situation surrounding him and events that occur around him are a little hard to believe.It is these factors I feel detract from this film and keep it from the level from which critics have elevated it. A superb film, one deserving the Academy Award for best picture? Perhaps.  But not an all-time classic.",Null,0,0,13 December 2000
American History X," Powerful and frightening
","For every thirty worthless, big-budget, shoot-em-up action movies whose only purpose is to make a profit, there is a film such as this one.'American History X' is one of the most effective, yet frightening, films I have ever seen.  I say frightening because it shows how impressionable young people are, and how easily they are led by someone who asserts him or herself.  The need to feel important and the need for fraternity is prevalent, showing that people are willing to do things they wouldn't normally do, just to be accepted.  Edward Furlong's character is so enamored by his older brother that he tries to emulate his entire lifestyle.  Even Ed Norton's character, Derrick, who seems to be in control, has been influenced by his prejudicial father.  It takes a stint in prison, and a friendship with a black prisoner that changes his life, for him to realize that spending all of one's time hating is wrong.This is not a movie about neo-Nazi's, although the trailers for this film made it look as if it were.  Rather it is about choices and focuses on the lives of people involved with a hate-group to get it's message across;  it shows the scary but real consequences of living such a life.I only gave this movie an 8, however, because I had some issues with the film-making that detracted from it.  The story and theme, as I have just commented on, were practically flawless, but Edward Furlong is not an actor I like to see in such an important role, and the ending was predictable. There was an abundance of flashbacks and I think more time should have been spent in the present.  These are minor complaints that are easily overlooked, but they are part of the film so I have to factor them in.I find it unfortunate that it was only released in 1200 or so theaters because of its controversial subject matter, because THIS is the type of film that should have been released 'in theaters everywhere'.",8,0,0,3 May 1999
The Usual Suspects," Great ending for an otherwise average movie
","This film has one of the classic endings in motion picture history, but that's the only thing extraordinary about it.  The ending can not make up for the rest movie, which at times is confusing and slow-moving.",1,10,19,15 September 1998
Saving Private Ryan," A film I will never forget
","When I went to see this film I thought I knew what to expect--a gory, realistic war drama about a group of men whom we come to have emotions for, not unlike the characters in 'Platoon' or 'Full Metal Jacket,' but I was sorely mistaken.This film was not only realistic, it was heart-wrenching and thrilling, and never before has a film had such an emotional impact on me.  Never before have I pitied and felt so strongly for characters in a movie because I always found most movies to merely be entertainment, with the exception of a few other films dealing with equally significant issues, but something was different about 'Saving Private Ryan'.  It made me reflect on my own life and I actually found myself thanking God that I have never experienced something as horrifying and gruesome as the experience of the soldiers as portrayed in the opening and closing scenes.  A month after seeing it, I still find myself contemplating the horror experienced by so many men, and I can't fathom the misery, anguish, and suffering encountered by those soldiers. The character Private Ryan was superfluous to the story, a mere gimmick in my mind for Spielberg to portray the Hell that must be combat.",10,0,0,15 September 1998
The Shawshank Redemption," The greatest transition from confinement to freedom ever portrayed in film
","Not only is this film one of the most touching I have ever seen, it also has one of the most unexpected and inspiring endings I have ever seen.  The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I've heard",10,6,10,14 September 1998
The Sixth Sense," Let US see some dead people
","'I see dead people' is the catch phrase from this boring, excruciatingly slow, and dull 'horror' movie.  I find that quite amusing because after the first hour passed without a glimpse of anything abnormal and the little brat said 'I see dead people' I thought to myself 'let US see some dead people!'The ending, which was interesting but came after the movie could have ended appropriately several times, does not compensate for the 2 hours I spent bored and restless in my seat.How is this movie so well liked? I'll never understand people...they're the worst.",1,6,15,10 September 1999
The Thin Red Line," Boooooooooring
","I guess it's important to know people in high places, how else could one explain Terrence Malick actually having a 'movie' like this as acclaimed as it is? I have quoted the word 'movie' because it was a movie only in the sense that it was shot on film and it is seen in a theater.  Otherwise it is just a plotless, empty, superficial examination of what Mr. Malick THINKS war would be like.How can this  be considered for an Academy Award? There is NO PLOT; the 'movie' continuously seemed as if it were building toward something and then...NOTHING.'The Thin Red Line' would be better suited for National Geographic or a Discovery channel documentary, with its endless and tiresome shots of wildlife and foliage, and as if those were not bad enough in themselves, they weren't even placed well within the 'moment.'  The only relevant shot of an animal in this 'film' came with a bird struggling for its life amidst the battle.  The opening scene is of an alligator while the music in the background is escalating and then...NOTHING.  Two and a half HOURS later we see the alligator again, WOW! I got chills! What a great technique! Now I understand the meaning of life!I understood the theme which was explained in the first of what seemed like an infinite amount of narratives, 'Nature is endlessly fighting with itself,' or some philisophical garbage like that.  But this 'movie' tries to do too much and left me as well as the rest of the audience, or what was left of it, gawking at the screen in a state of confusion and disbelief when the credits FINALLY rolled.You can call me crazy, but I think characters are important, and if Mr. Malick hadn't intended to focus on any one character, then why did he add elements to the 'film' (such as the cheating wife) that would make it seem as if he were but ran out of time?At least I wasn't so withdrawn as not to notice George Clooney's perfect hair in the MIDDLE OF THE JUNGLE!",1,4,8,23 January 1999
