The Blair Witch Project," The Scary Movie That Wasn't.
","Perhaps my expectations were too high.  Perhaps the anticipation was too attenuated.  Perhaps someone switched reels in the projector room before the movie started.  The main problem with the film, IMHO, is that the characters are just plain dumb.  They realize, albeit too late, that it's time to forsake their film project and haul ass out of the woods.  Like the characters, the audience is presented only with circumstantial evidence of supernatural events.  I guess this was supposed to heighten the tension, but instead with each passing 'occurrence' the characters simply plod ahead with their little film, making them pathetic figures.  For example, if one of your three-person crew suddenly disappeared without rhyme or reason one morning, would you think that he would signal his return by making muffled grunts in the pitch black dead of night?  Would you then call his name and turn on a bright camera light so whatever's out there could more easily find you?  Please.Although Heather has a touch of Ahab-like singlemindedness, the other two are stock characters who are content to follow her search for the white whale.. er, witch.  Wait for home video, crank up the 5.1 surround and turn off the nights. Talk to your friends while holding a flashlight under your chin, it's just as good.",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
