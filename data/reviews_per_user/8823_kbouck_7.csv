The Blair Witch Project," Way too overrated
",I thought this film was ok at best. I dont understand what all the hype is about. The camera work made me dizzy about 30 minutes into the movie. I thought the ending was scary and suspenseful and if the whole movie was like the ending...it would have been a much better movie. But overall I was bored with it.,Null,0,0,26 October 1999
Notting Hill," Very predicaable and not too 'charming' or funny.
",I was overall not too impressed with this movie. I found it to be very predictable and not too funny as well. Julia Roberts plays an actress- Anna Scott- who is filming a movie in London and meets a normal Joe named William and they develop a romance. I didnt think the love story between William and Anna was well developed at all. She was a total bitch to him and any normal guy would have dropped her like a bad habit instead of being such a chump. Spike the roommate was funny but hard to believe a guy could be that big of a dork in real life. The ending was typical and very predictable. I give this movie 6/10.,6,1,2,15 November 1999
The Exorcist," The absolute SCARIEST film of all time
","As a child in the 70's, I was always too scared to watch this movie. As an adult now, I watched this film all the way through for the first time and I think its a MASTERPIECE. It was so scary I had trouble sitting all the way through it. When Regan starts turning into the demon, her voice sounds like the devil and the room turns really cold, that is all so creepy. Just hearing her demonic voice made my skin crawl. Fantastic make up and acting by all. A must see for anyone who wants to be scared out of their wits. I give this 9/10.",9,0,0,5 November 1999
American History X," An excellent movie that is very realistic
","I was super impressed with this movie. I thought the script and the realism of the movie was just brilliant. Ed Norton proved once again he is phenomenal actor. Anybody who doesn't like this movie because of the racial overtones, lighten up. You knew what this movie was about before you rented it didn't you?? Yes the movie is about racism. If you can think of a way to make a movie about racism without the characters being racist let us know ok???  Some excellent points were brought up in this movie 1) It is possible for somebody who once used to be a 'skinhead' to want to turn their life around 2)'Affirmative Action is not fare and needs to be abolished 3)This movie makes people think twice about joining a huge organization like the skinheads. Just when you think they are your friends, they can turn into your worst enemy. This is an excellent film, highly recommended for somebody who wants to be taught a few lessons about life and who we choose as our friends. I give this movie 9/10. It was outstanding.",9,0,0,16 November 1999
Schindler's List," A Masterpiece, the second time around.
","Believe it or not...I rented this movie back in 93 or 94 when it was first released, and didnt understand much of it and didnt even watch all of it. I turned it off out of boredom and confusion. At that time I knew nothing about WWII, nor did I really care.Lately, I have been reading alot about WWII,Hitler,Himmler, and have been reading survivor stories from concentration camp survivors, particularly Auschwitz. I have also read many stories on the other concentration camps, and have come across many more stories of camp and ghetto survivors, and have read them all with sadness, but with interest. I have even had the pleasure of corresponding with an Auschwitz survivor and Schindlers List seems VERY realistic as to what actually happened in the camps and ghettos.The movie is very easy to understand if you have basic knowledge of WWII and the holocaust. Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, a NAZI businessman who wants to hire some camp jews as cheap slave labor to work for him (as many many companies did back then). These people that work for him are treated with a little respect and given decent working conditions. Soon many other Jews are depserate to work for him, as they realise that could mean they will not die in the camps. Oskar starts to get extremely irritated when he learns that the evil camp SS Amon Goeth (played by Ralph Fiennes) is killing many of his workers without good cause and wants the killings to stop. He then finds out that many of his workers will be sent to Auschwitz, where death is almost certain, unless something is done. He then uses his power and money to bribe many high ranking Nazi officials to bringing his workers to another country via train to have them work in a plant, where they will be saved from execution. Although he loses just about everything in the process, saving the lives of more than 1000 Jews proved worth it in the end, afterall, 'You save one life...you save the world entire.' I was surprised they even threw in a small role of the 'Angel of Death', the evil Dr. Josef Mengele, who basically was responsible for the death of many many Jews, via the gas chamber, and his horrible, cruel,useless experiments. He was the one at Auschwitz who walked around determining who was fit to work, and who should die. If you were an older person, sick, weak,or had a small child, you were most likely sent to the gas chamber.This is an outstanding movie and I'm very glad I rented it. I highly recommend it to everyone. Kudos to Steven Speilberg for this masterpiece.",9,9,13,5 July 2000
Life Is Beautiful," Very good movie but no masterpiece
","I watched this movie these weekend shown in Italian with English subtitles. I'm still trying to decide whether it was worth the several Oscars it won. The storyline is simple. Guido,Dora and their young son Joshua are sent to a concentration camp because they are jewish. Guido tries to make light of what is a very horrific, nightmarish situation by heavily improvising to his young son by using humor that it is all just a game. The young boy that played the son was brilliant in the role-he is VERY talented. I didn't think the harsh reality of the camp was built up enough in this movie. If they would have put more detail into the horrible reality of the camp it would have made the movie better. Overall it was good and enjoyable. I give it 7/10.",7,1,2,13 December 1999
Titanic," The highest grossing movie of all time for good reason
","There are some real hair brained idiots that have made postings on this site trashing this movie for absolutely no good reason. To the person who thought it was unrealistic,had lousy dialogue, said dolphins dont exist in that part of the ocean, and that theres no way people can survive in that cold of water for more than 3 minutes?? Are you a scientist? You know all of this for a fact?? You mean to tell me that every single film that you have seen, every single second,every frame has to be 100% realisitc or you give it a good dissing?? It's obvious you have done no research on this tragedy before you posted your careless remarks. First of all...according to the Dolphin Research Institute, Dolphins DO exist in those waters. According to records of the sinking, some survivors in the waters lived for up to 15 minutes before freezing to death, not the 3 minutes you claim. And you actually think the dialogue is worthy of a kindergarden movie?? Give me a break. You can honestly say that the script didnt make you laugh or get a watery eye at least once?? You ripped this movie to shreds for no good reason. You based your opinions on nothing but untruths. The special effects in this film are phenomenal and its obvious James Cameron did his homework before making this film. The ship was reconstructed almost to a tee.  Perhaps you and wifey should rent ISHTAR or Police Academy 5 ,,sounds like those movies are more about your speed. Happy viewing!",10,2,4,28 October 1999
