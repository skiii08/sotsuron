Ford v Ferrari," A well written movie with real characters
","This was all round a really good movie, it was funny, emotional, exciting and interesting all at once. The characters felt real and managed to capture genuine human interactions and it all built to provide a very emotional ending.The sets were great and really gave you a feeling of being back in the 60's and there were some very interesting little tidbits thrown in showing how ww2 had left its scar on many people. It did this while maintaining a careful view of its priorities, it wasnt there to tell you what the 60's were but to use it as a backdrop for a real story.The acting was superb throughout, Damon really gave a strong performance and Bale really managed to convey well the good and bad character traits with real respect for the person he was representing. Also, although Caitriona Balfe was playing a supporting role I think her performance really needs to be called out. Caitriona managed to portray real strength and respect in a female character, she never went around screaming she was better than men, she instead portrayed real emotions, real reactions and genuine heart. I felt her supporting role was very well done too.Overall this felt like a movie which had some respect for its audiences intelligence and managed to really provide both genuine escapism and tell a very interesting and engaging story. Highly recommended viewing.",9,1,1,22 November 2019
First Man," Stunning, moving biopic with a couple of quirks
","I have to say overall the movie was very moving and feels like a real love letter to a seminal character in what would have to be considered the most amazing thing we have ever done as a species.The acting was reserved and powerfully moving. The story focuses on the real human element but without missing on the visceral experience of the build up to the moon landing and the landing itself.There were a couple of quirks, namely that Gemini is and always has been pronounced Gem-in-eye not Gem-in-ee and it feels really strange every time that pronounce it incorrectly. That probably wont annoy most people but, well, it kind of irritated me. Also oddly the camera work was not stable through most of the film. It may have been a stylistic choice I am not sure but that seemed kind of odd. Even so those are pretty minor gripes in an otherwise excellent movie, well worth your time to watch.",8,2,8,12 October 2018
Train to Busan," Fantastic
","I have seen many zombie movies, I am a bit of a horror fan and I can sum this up very simply.It is in my opinion the very best zombie movie I have ever seen, by a clear mile.",9,3,5,20 April 2019
Aquaman," Sorry Aquaman is the brilliant superhero story from DC? Did not see that coming
","I do not commonly give out even 9's and so far have given a half dozen or so movies ever made as a 10 but you know this really was in contention for a 10. I have to be honest I really didnt think an aquaman movie was going to be that great when it was announced, they did such a bad job with both superman and batman and considering how much better I considered those characters to be I didnt see they could do much with aquaman, I was very very wrong.This is genuinely excellent, it is a superhero movie and of course therefore hits all the same sort of high points of any superhero movie but just does it all brilliantly. They gave aquaman himself a really fun and interesting character, they had an excellent story with really well written characters and a lot of laughs along the way too. The story is a real spectacle on top of that so really what more could you possibly ask for?If you want a good action adventure then this is a top class example of it.",9,17,37,12 December 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Magnificent Movie, a must see for 2018
","So recently a lot of films I see have lackluster acting, poor scripts, badly written characters. Not all but an awful lot, far more than in previous decades. This however stands out not only for being an excellent movie in its own right but for being a key example of the exact opposite of all of these things.The acting was in every single actors case excellent, not a single person does a bad job in this movie. The script had believable dialogue and portrayed the characters in a way which made them very clear and recognisable. The music was Queens and so given its one of the greatest bands in history is of course magnificent. Its a wonderfully produced and moving movie.The only gripe I would have is, yes given the actions we know Paul Prenter took he has been villainised and it seems with some legitimacy. Still given he has died and cannot defend himself I am not sure its fair to portray a person without their own perspective in this way. Its understandable though and the reality is you cannot talk about Freddy Mercurys life without discussing him so they had to do something.Wonderful movie though, an absolute must watch.",9,3,5,19 November 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What a fantastic allegory
","I have never considered myself a Tarantino fan as such, though I have seen most of his movies and they have always been interesting and decent movies. Given I have rated this movies so high though I think thats worth noting, I think as a stand alone movie this really was exceptional.I really wish I would have the chance to speak with the movie creators with this one to see if my interpretations match with their vision. There is so much here to unpack if you look into it.The movie has elements which hark back to a golden age, when people in Hollywood made movies and TV to entertain and to venerate hero's. At that same time this also seems to show so much that reflects modern society. You have the man who has been accused of a crime (killing his wife) and who everyone as judged and punished without any proof that the accusation is true. You have all the elements in hollywood which have led to its devolving into a mockery of itself, just repeating old stories and having no true imagination any more. Its all set to a background of a man who feels like he is over the hill, and struggling to come to terms with the way things are changing.All of this comes with a side story, which mimics the true stories of the manson family. Those who know the story of the mansons know these were left wing 'hippies' as they were known, who preached love while in reality using this as nothing more than an excuse to justify terrible actions by calling people they didnt like fascists. In reality the story of the mansons involved a group of four innocent people, including a pregnant woman who was brutally murdered by several of the girls who supported manson and manson himself. This movie however does something truly brilliant with its ending. Instead of mirroring the reality, this movie instead has the final scene doing what Hollywood always did, it paints reality as though the bad guys can never win. Instead of reflecting what really happened our heros have a redemption arc, killing the evil hippies.I would be absolutely fascinated to speak with the creators of this movie and see if they agree with my interpretation, and if a movie can make you think this much while also entertaining you the whole time, well that movie is truly fantastic.",10,32,50,17 August 2019
Midsommar," Well that was certainly.... interesting
","Calling this a horror is really quite misleading, thats not an accurate moniker to give this movie. It is definitely a movie which makes you feel shock, and unease aplenty but its really not horror, rather its a quite unique movie which manages to create a very uneasy and frankly at times quite queasy feeling while you watch it.Its definitely worth a watch, a very curious movie with a lot of artistry. Some of the story is told in very interesting ways as well, from the less subtle like panning across telling local pictures to interesting hints such as the runes on the hand drawn picture of the girl along with the same runes on her tunic later.Its very difficult to explain a lot of this movie without a lot of spoilers and frankly I would very strongly recommend you watch this movie without any spoilers. The feeling will be far more visceral that way.My final verdict, very much worth watching but expect to feel quite uncomfortable at times.",7,0,2,15 July 2019
Midway," Solid, respectful and devoid of modern political statements, a real movie about a real event
","This movie was very well done, the acting was very decent, the script was respectful of the content it was covering and quite suspenseful and the effects were very decent.It may not be in line with some of the classic movies but its an extremely competent and well produced movie which is a genuine spectacle at the cinema.Well worth viewing I would say.",8,6,9,16 November 2019
