50 First Dates," 7 First Stars
","This move is a little out of Sandler's repertoire but it could be one of his best. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth: an ocean-cuddling bachelor who manages to enchant single women on their vacations in Hawaii, whose character also manages to use typical movie bachelor clich√©. Though this side of Sandler is well under-developed because he soon falls for a woman (Drew Barrymore) who is living a Truman Show-esque life with the same day re-inacted by her stern but then soon loving father and her obnoxious brother who often makes a fool of himself when displaying muscular pride. Although the characters in this film sort of have a schizophrenia, due to the fact characters change insanely quickly, this film is indeed in its own. This is the romantic comedy unlike others. The humour is quirky and very little, with the walruses overused to display humorous inclination in Roth's life.Though of course we expected a happy ending from the start (what is a Rom Com without one?) but this film is sure a success. Occasionally funny but unlike Sandler the humour isn't forced down our throats. We aren't laughing at his over-portrayal of an extreme character, we're looking at a guy who realises he wants to use any means possible to get the 'girl of his dreams'. The film has unnecessary parts of it and Rob Schneider's part again was just absolute ridiculous, pushing stereotypes to the extreme in unfunny ways (Big Daddy his best attempt) but despite quick-changing characters this film is immense.",7,1,1,13 August 2013
Now You See Me," And Now You Go See It
","I just returned with a family visit to watch the much anticipated film for a clan of us magic- adorers. With the classics such as Prestige backlogged and the disappointing Burt Wonderstone washed away from our minds, we ventured to view this.Jesse Eisenburg is as great as always. Similar to a Mark Zuckerberg, he plays a quick-witted, fast-talking ace who lives in a very controlling mindframe. The beautiful Isla Fisher, his glamorous past assistant determined to prove her excellence. The great Woody Harrelson as the mentalist, often the two phrases for the word flickering between his character. And the young Dave Franco as the young, loyal member of the troop.The film is overall very clever. Upon four magicians discovering an array of blueprints for magical machinery, they set out for stardom following the rules and paths of this plan devised by the almost fictitious card-requester. Morgan Freeman plays a very condescending guy towards the FBI, impersonating the role and the persona of a magician, whilst at the same time being a failure of one.The actual magic shows are very little, disappointing, though it fits with the plot. Mark Ruffalo is a detective, constantly overshadowed and a few steps behind these Magicians.Thats why the film excels. The acting is very strong and the character development is little though the point is clearly made. The film stresses several main themes of 'everything is not as you see' and 'viewing the big picture'.An understandable 8/10",8,1,4,15 July 2013
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," very good, not enough action
","when i sat down in the theatre to enjoy rise of the planet of the apes, in eagerness to purchase the box set sold at HMV for the originals. i think it was acted well and Tom Felton made me laugh like he does as he played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter films. i thought there would be more of the riot they would lead towards taking over the planet, and less of the evolution of the mind.I enjoyed it overall and look forward to the early ones and thinks that will roman is a lot better as a scientist instead of throwing pumpkin bombs ;) it makes me think of what could actually happen and felt much sympathy for Will Rodman's father, who had Alzeimer's.",7,2,4,11 August 2011
Behind The Candelabra," Why BTC Excels
","Its not very clear from the huge advertisements circling the world around us and the internet, but Behind the Candelabra is a very graphic film. The director, Steven Soderbergh, is very ignorant to the traditional men of values and pushes the intimacy and the unravels the unknown mystery of who is Liberace.Matt Damon is an orphan, abandoned by an untrustworthy mother, who never feels at home with his foster home despite his appreciation for what they have done for him. He finds solace with the great piano player Liberace and they start a gay love affair. One may try to relate this film to another successful homosexual hit Brokeback Mountain, but the very message of hidden secrets, fame and possessions all spin off into a completely new horizon. Though one must not compare these two movies as they are rarely alike.Matt Damon brings across an excellent portrayal of a bisexual behind-the-scenes aficionado for Liberace who in return acts as a father to him. Despite the intense love affair, there is clearly a sort of sixth-sense father-son bond binding these two together.Some scenes triumphed for emotional intensity but this isn't a film about love between two gay men. This is a movie about two men who use each other to fill a void left in them from temporarily places in their histories.",7,0,2,16 June 2013
