The Blair Witch Project," HOW did this movie get such good reviews??
","Would someone please tell me what exactly was so terrifying about this movie??  I sat through the BORING beginning waiting for it to get better.  I sat through the BORING middle, telling myself that the end would be the scariest thing I'd ever seen.  And then I got to the end, if you can even call it that, and just thought WHAT??  What about this lame movie was so ingeniously terrifying????  It was supposed to be SO scary and SO good, but it was terrible.  I'll tell you why it got such good reviews. All of the critics wanted people to think that they were smart and that everyone who thought the movie was bad was stupid.  It's just like the Emperor's New Clothes.  My advice: avoid this movie at all costs.",1,2,3,1 November 1999
