Howl's Moving Castle," Calcifer for President!
","I'm not gonna feast myself over not ending cheering for the artistic appearance of this masterpiece. It's a Miyazaki...what bigger compliment could an anime get? Only so much: The villages in this one and of course the castle are some of the sweetest, most charming and coziest places I have ever seen. They are the childish and nice brother of Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. But now for the 3 things that made this movie a very exceptional pleasure for me: Hihn the dog, the scarecrow and Calcifer the fire. Where else do you see a paranoid flame, a dog with the voice of a chain smoker and a jumping stick with a tuxedo on? If you agree with me when I say these examples show the brilliant fantasy of Hayao Miyazaki and truly prove the reputation Studio Ghibli enjoys to be right, you will probably also cheer at the end of the movie, just like I did. Inside the universe of fairy tales, I am happy to have the Studio Ghibli, since this is the only studio to create stories for children and adults as well. I don't think I will ever get too old for their films. At least, that's what I hope.",8,0,1,18 December 2006
Casablanca," THE Hollywood romance itself!
","This movie can compete with the most famous and timeless love stories in history, like Romeo & Julia, the beauty and the beast, Julia Roberts and Richard Geere.Always remember while you watch it: 1942. Not such a nice time for the world! Not such a nice time for romance. Not such a nice time to stand up against something. It must have been quite an effort to shoot this film during such harsh times. I mean, it's quite a political movie and the scene with the Marseillaise must have been a punch in the face of every fascist.But all the political quarrels are combined with an amazing love story that hasn't lost a single ounce of its attraction or beauty throughout the years.But what really made a classic out of the picture is, in my opinion, Humphrey Bogart. I consider him the man of the millennium, a guy with so much masculine attitude and yet so much feeling. It's just an eye-catching experience to see him walk and talk and, most impressive, drink. Any other actor drinks quite ordinary. It's not a big deal to empty a glass of booze. But when Bogie does it, you can feel his pain. You can feel his grief and his anger. You can feel the person behind the scene. If you ask me for the man I respect the most in movie history, it has to be Humphrey Bogart.Sure, the rest of the cast does a great job as well, Ignrid Bergmann is responsible for half of the chemistry between Rick and Ilsa but well, I can only see them in the shadow of Bogie.This is one of those movies, you hear so much talking about and you begin to ask what's so great about a dusty old flick, but after you've watched it, you realize what everybody was talking about. At least, that's how I did.A truly timeless tale about romance with the perfect cast and probably the most memorable quotes in history. Terrific!",9,4,6,23 December 2006
Se7en," Nice movie.
","Okay, maybe I'm giving this a 7 because I saw 'Fight Club' before 'Se7en'. And maybe also because I'm not so keen on thrillers.Anyway, I liked watching it. The characters are cool, the plot is tight and sharp and it sure has its moments. Hell, it made me read Milton and Dante.But what shall I say...it's simply not as big and cool as 'Fight Club' is. Okay, it doesn't want and it doesn't need to be that. But if you wanna top up the content of a thriller with some critic on the society, it's just natural to be compared with 'Fight Club'. And this battle has a clear winner.Others than that, the movie has a beautiful cast, leaded by two of the best actors of all time, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. But also Gwyneth and Brad, both none of my favorite actors, are decent.It's an enjoyable, nice movie, with a predictable ending, some of the worst imaginable deaths and a Spacey beside 'American Beauty'.",7,1,2,18 December 2006
Hostel," Nothing special
","I don't see all the noise around this little flick. Ultra-brutal? Hell no. Funny in a trash sort of way maybe. And since it was basically only advertised by its failing gore, the rest, as I expected, isn't worth any attention. The story is just nonsense. Maybe someone should have told Eli Roth that to feel and fear with and for the main character, the main character should have a character. Here we have somebody who's about as interesting as an AXE TV model, minus the abs. Two eastern European babes, one sex addict from Iceland and of course the villains...it's just not enough for a full length feature. The settings are pretty decent and probably the only believable thing. The cinematography has a fresh look since movies aren't shot that frequent in this area but that's about it. Hostel is boring, lame, not even especially gruesome and it does never justice to its hype. But for kiddies who haven't seen somebody's finger getting cut off: Enjoy it while your parents are out for anniversary dinner, you little punks.",3,2,4,7 July 2008
Snatch," Highly entertaining!
","SNATCH is one of those movies, I can watch over and over again without getting tired of it. It's just such a great plot with extremely amusing characters. Ever last little character has its own amusing tic and none of them is really sane. Turkish is named after a plane crash. Nobody understands Mickey. Brick Top is simply furious all the time. Tony switches rage on and off like the light. Frankie is as lucky in crime as he is unlucky in gambling. Sol, Vinny and Tyrone try to be gangsters. Avi can't stand England. Doug is dying to be Jewish. Thommy does what he can to support Turkish. And nobody likes the guys who live in the camp side. Now put all of them in a pond, throw in a 84 carat diamond and you bet, the result is gonna be one hell of entertainment. Guy Ritchie really proved his ability to make unusual, funny, fast and original films with this one. Above all, this is one of the few films, I can't find a single flaw. Everything matches, nothing is too much or too little in it.Wonderful!",8,1,2,29 December 2006
Pearl Harbor," Michael Bay and a serious topic...hum...something's not right!
","I'll try to keep it short. I don't want to keep you up for long with my hymns about how distasteful and dumb this movie is. I'll try to keep it all in a nutshell.Let's start with the actors. One-face Affleck meets pretty-boy Hartnett. I kinda miss the part where these two show a believable performance as soldiers. They are kids on a playground! They don't deliver any drama or horror. They are what they are: Third class actors.The plot. Oh my god, the plot...not ending garbage about romance, friendship, loyalty and so on. And then, oh dear Lord, war comes to Hawaii. And you feel pretty comfortable watching the action on the screen. I don't want to feel happy when I watch a movie about a war! I wanna feel thrilled, disgusted, touched! This isn't BAD BOYS! Michael Bay is a great director for shallow, entertaining and funny action films. BAD BOYS II is marvelous. But this here? No way. This is an insult. Shame on everyone, who worked on this movie! They showed a big lack of sensibility or even sanity.",3,0,1,19 December 2006
The Lives of Others," Very good movie with very few flaws
","When I watched the first trailer of 'Das Leben der Anderen', I wasn't excited at all about this movie which isn't surprising since I consider myself everything but a fan of German movies about German past. Then I learned the rating my favorite critic gave it (5/5) and became curious about this movie. So a friend and I went to see it and I gotta admit, it's quite a decent movie! At least, far better than the (in my view) horribly overrated 'Goodbye Lenin'. The story is exciting and keeps you fascinated till the credits roll which isn't standard, these days anyway. The actors are all together nothing less than terrific and there lays the biggest quality of the movie. The camera and the score aren't very good, neither are the settings. And the story, as well-written it is, has it's black sheep. For example, and this is a big SPOILERnow so watch out, dear reader, the suicide towards the end. Yeah, it's dramatic and surprising and all that but too constructed and built to fit in the realistic and authentic world the film claims to portrait. Next big SPOILERcomes right away, when I find myself obligated to complain about the first hour of the movie when the tough and rough Stasi agent Wiesler almost immediately falls in love with the lifestyle of his target. There it appears just too obvious that the length became a problem so the director had to rush through this part. The SPOILERS end here. In the end what's left is a nice movie about loss and love in a place ruled by observation and terror. It claims to be like 'Full Metal Jacket' but has more of the modern tales by Zemeckis and Besson. Besides these difficulties in matters of identity, it remains a good drama!",7,3,22,18 September 2006
Grave of the Fireflies," The frame for frame best anti-war-movie I've seen so far
","The Ghibli-studios truly deserve the reputation they have. 'Spirited Away' won the Oscar, 'Princess Mononoke' was the most successful Japanese picture (and possibly still is, I'm not sure) and the movie I comment here really is the best anti-war-movie I've seen. And I've seen not too few of them. The helplessly overrated 'Saving Private Ryan', the excellent 'The big red One' and of course 'Apocalypse Now Redux', 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket'. But why is 'Hotaru no haka' or 'The last fireflies', who it's called here, the best in my view? I find it portraits a totally different attribute of war than for example 'the Deerhunter' or 'Full Metal Jacket', where the loss is humanity and the souls of the soldiers. This movie here shows with it's cartoon way of telling the horror war always brings to the civilians. It sure shows only the very top of the iceberg but in this context, I find this is an appropriate action. I personally got truly cured from every thought about joining any army and going to any war by this movie. The biggest quality of this excellent anime lays in it's rough and authentic tragedy. It's not even the death of the little girl, but the lack of sense in it, that manufactures most of the horror. I admit, I shed a few tears. And so did anyone I gave the DVD to watch. And this is something no other movie about war ever managed to do: Making me cry.",9,1,2,15 September 2006
Big Fish," Inspiring feel-good movie
","BIG FISH is a terrific tale, illustrated by the very best of Tim Burton's incomparable style and carried by two of the finest actors of Hollywood.It's the story about a boy, who was simply too big for his little hometown and according to this sets out for a never ending adventure through the whole world. But what of his stories is true and what sprang off his huge imagination? Everybody loves Edward Bloom, except his son. He is always standing in the shadow of his father. Just until he learns how much reality really was in his fathers tales.I always get this big smile when I've watched this movie. It just makes me happy to see it, every single time. All the odds in it make it amazingly charming and the end is a new kind of happy ending.Salute to you, Mister Burton!",9,1,1,29 December 2006
Rocky," Say what you want - It just works!
","Yeah, you can come along with deep, dramatic and artistic films. Movies about true life. Movies with the greatest special effects ever shown. Stories, written by the best-payed screen writers ever to be. Bring in Kubrick. Send me Scorsese. Come on, Kurosawa. Don't be shy, Coppola. Hurry, Leone. Bring'em all in. I will just sit calm on the fancy couch with my shoes on the fancy couch table and tell them that the script and the performance of a young, broke Italian guy touched and moved me more than all of them ever did.Yes, I call ROCKY one of the best movies ever.Yes, I call the training sequence one of the most inspiring moments in history.Yes, I call Rocky Balboa one of the greatest guys I ever got to know.ROCKY is a religion. ROCKY's there for you, if you don't feel like doing, trying anything anymore. When you're plain crap on the floor, then ROCKY is the thing to lift you up. The story of this naive bum from Philadelphia, who had a miserable life with one little sparkle in the darkness, which he took and turned into a big fire.The will is the most powerful force in the world, Rocky Balboa showed us. And damn, every time he does it again, I feel the old shiver running down my spine and I say quietly 'Go and get them, Rock!'",9,3,5,18 December 2006
Castle in the Sky," The Brothers Grimm of our days go by the names of Hayao Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli
","Wow, another ride on a roller-coaster, created by Studio Ghibli and its personal saint, Hayao Miyazaki. I still don't know what impressed me more about it: The art, the pictures or the fantasy the story is driven by. I probably never will be able to make a decision about that.So forget about that and let me just say, watching a movie that carries the name 'Miyazaki' somewhere is a guarantee for being on a trip through fantastic lands, inhabited by fresh, cool, amusing, impressive creatures and enjoying some of the most charming and unpredictable tales ever told.Some words on the graphics: This movie was made in a time where a computer that was capable of displaying the game 'Pong' in a decent way had the size of a one-story-house. There was no Pixar, no ILM, no WETA Digital. There were crayons, pens and the talented hands of the incredible crew, gathered around Hayao Miyazaki. And just with that they created animated pictures that even nowadays let most other cartoons look like the work of an infant. An example? Just take a look at the castle towards the end.This is not a movie. This is a world on its own. And I enjoyed the visit.I can't wait till Christmas because this piece of art is gonna be one of my presents. Two more words: Special Edition!",9,0,0,18 December 2006
Army of Darkness," Incredibly funny and entertaining
","Sam Raimi is at least as cool as Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez. Why's that? Well, they share some similarities in their career, especially Rodriguez and Raimi. Both had basically no money to shoot their first film but did it anyway. With what result? Both made fine movies, far from the usual and the known. They just shot their vision. Ain't that an awesome thing to watch? Well, EVIL DEAD is past, ARMY OF DARKNESS is the subject under discussion. And damn, of all three movies about the eternal unlucky fellow Ash, who always reminds me of full-time victim of life Al Bundy, I like ARMY OR DARKNESS the best. Finally Sam Raimi had enough money to create a movie with lots of amusing special effects. Just look at the rise of Evil Ash out of his grave. You must have issues if you don't laugh when you see that.In the end, it's a comedy but a truly original one. Bruce Campell is just the man for this role and he is one great actor. ARMY OF DARKNESS is at least in the Top 5 of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Just the first dialog between Ash and Henry the Red...'Well hello Mister fancy pants!' This movie didn't give a damn about anybody's opinion. They just made what they liked and that's a wonderful act of courage. I'm not getting tired of hoping they make a number 4. The end of ARMY is open for some more adventures for poor Ash.'Yoh, Shebitch!'",8,3,4,19 December 2006
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Too much for its own good
","After the first 20 minutes, you have had quite an impression of how the rest of the movie is gonna be. What works in a novel is not automatically right for a movie. I've read the novel and it was the only one ever to bring me nightmares, just with its sophisticated way of telling and explaining. The horror is hidden, crouching, spiteful. In a nutshell, quite amazing.But the movie is a poor piece of trying but not achieving. Coppola made THE GODFATHER, one of the two 9.1 of this website. But this here is a great disappointment.Why? Because they try to stay close to the book. Fine. Dracula is described as an old but strong man with hairy hands and a big nose. They did this here. But at this point it seems they've stopped to stay by the book and started to do their own flick. I can't recall that Dracula had some kind of a relationship with Mina others than his desire to drink her blood and make her his slave. Then this crap with Renfield. In the book, he escapes and fights with the strength of five man, just to have his spine snapped like a twig by Dracula a few pages later. Here, we see a whole different type. He also only eats one fly. If you start with it, you should go with it and not just drop it, because the movie gets to long even without this feature of it.Lucy, the charming, beautiful and truly happy Lady Westenra appears here as a man-eating slut. Abraham Van Helsing, the sophisticated, strong, dauntless scientist is a crazy, weird and jumpy old fart, who can't even keep himself from kissing obsessed Mina. The three men in Lucy's life appear as shallow punks, hard to distinguish by their appearances or by their behaviors, but never to be taken as full breathing and feeling beings. Mina Harker, the good heart in the story, whose loyalty to her beloved Jonathan can't be shaken by evil powers is here the reincarnation of Dracula's old bride and actually in love with him! With him! If that's not crap, what is? Last but not least, Dracula. It is true that Gary Oldman can fill a cinema screen with his charisma as the deep and bad villain. But here, he is not a former butcher, who killed whoever stood into his path, here he is the disenchanted lover, who lost his bride and can't bear loving a faith anymore, which bans his one love into eternal damnation just because she took her own life. This is just not the way it is in the book! Fine, do your own thing but don't claim to stick with something and just don't do it then. That's not the way to make things.There's no horror in this movie, if you don't consider a poorly made wannabe-werewolf, a guy in a spandex-bat-suit, ridiculously green smoke and stupidly obvious shadow-plays to be horror. The scene with the wolf was a bit creepy, so was the man of rats and Renfield had the potential to be a scary character but they didn't make anything out of that.Coppola tried to create horror by showing everything instead of just leaving hints like for example in HALLOWEEN, but he failed to show really scary images and so the whole movie appears like a colorful children's birthday. It simply doesn't work at all. It's not even especially nice styled or designed. They tried to copy Tim Burton throughout but never reached his class. The castle is a mistaken effort to build a memorable building, the Westenra Mansion is an annoying piece of architecture and, sorry to say so, but the costumes, which earned several awards, look like they were taken from the local Halloween spooky shop. It's more of a Scooby-Doo film than a true Dracula movie.It's waste of talent, time and money.Stick with HORROR OF Dracula with the incomparable Christopher Lee, THE GODFATHER trilogy and APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX. Forget this embarrassment.",4,9,17,26 December 2006
Raging Bull," Now I really know, why Scorsese is called 'one of the greatest'
","Really now, I've seen 'Gangs of New York' and was like 'Huh? And what's the big deal about this guy?' I've lately bought 'Raging Bull' and watched it a few times ever since. And I start to understand.As I read in the booklet (God bless the Gold Editions!) Martin Scorsese was very sick before and during the shooting of this movie and also wasn't excited about the material at all. Robert DeNiro literally had to persuade him of taking a deeper look at it. After discovering his own self-destructive side during some time in the hospital, Scorses finally found his relation to Jake LaMotta and started to shoot. Or at least tried, because they had to force the producers into paying them, they used 'Rocky II' to put pressure on them, but anyway, 'Raging Bull' started. Maybe this is one of the big difficulties and one of the reasons, why many people don't get this movie. Even Scorsese didn't get it for a long time.I don't know if I'm the only one who does it like that, but I start to judge a film already by its opening credits and damn, 'Raging Bull' has surely some Top 5 opening credits of all times! It's absolutely hypnotic to see DeNiro jump and punch in the ring, all in slow motion with this beautiful music in the back. Ties you to the seat from the beginning. And it's necessary to tie the viewer to the seat with all these horrible scenes that come afterward. Horrible in the sense of the desired horror of a horrible person. The whole movie analyzes Jake's life. He treated his ex-wife, his brother and almost everybody else close to him very bad. Only in the ring he was at home and wanted the way he was. And so it feels in the movie. The boxing scenes are artistic, stylistic, even iconic. The rest is the filth of a bad life. Fights and beatings, arguments, destruction, torment. Jake LaMotta. And the audience must feel just like Jake LaMotta must feel while watching this movie: Uncomfortable. Bad. Just what the film makers wanted.It is surely no secret that DeNiro delivers one of his absolutely greatest performances ever here. Most people only know about the 60 pounds he gained. But that's only the easiest aspect of his preparations for this role. He also trained about the year with Jake LaMotta and even fought 3 real fights in Brooklyn. And won two of them. He was in the shape to become a contender! He talks like LaMotta too. There is this interview where for only one second the young LaMotta comes back and Jake talks like in the old days. You feel strange because it seems, he's acting like DeNiro. Of course Joe Pesci and everybody else are terrific too but DeNiro is just a giant.As a last aspect the artistic structure of some scenes: The third fight against Sugar Ray is shot in a bigger ring with fires burning under the camera to create this blurring and the smoky heat you can almost smell. The breath of Sugar Ray is a lion or a tiger. The shot of LaMotta's weak legs was made with DeNiro carrying another guy on his shoulders. Sorry but how much more creativity and brilliance can a director develop to make scenes like this??? Maybe some people first don't get the idea of self-destruction and second can't enjoy the uncomfortable feeling while watching this flick and give it bad rates because of this. It would flatter the movie when it really is like that.I love the movie. It is a huge picture and will probably never be forgotten.",9,2,4,18 January 2007
Casino Royale," Yeah well, I don't know...
","New actor, new style, new controversies...orthodox 007-movie lovers already started crying as soon as they saw the color of Craig's hair. Ridicoulos view of things, if you ask me. I saw quite a few interviews before I watched the movie yesterday and people like Martin Campell, Daniel Craig, Eva Green and some producers as well talked about the new style, the new Bond: Vulnerable, with flaws, harder, more realistic, closer to the book. Great, I thought, and where is the 007 in all this? On one hand, I like broken characters. I like hard human heroes. I like it, when a man, who has to be the perfect tool, aches and breaks under this weight.On the other hand, I always liked it when Bond mostly on his own dashed into the crazy villain's head quarter, fought the bodyguard, the villain, destroyed everything and rescued the girl to have sex with her right afterward. I'm a movie guy, I haven't read a 007 novel.So now, I'm not sure what I should think about the new Bond. It's a good thing to add some depth to the action hero but does James Bond need depth? I guess it's everyone's choice, whether if they embrace the Craig-Bond or miss the old days with funny gadgets, impossible stunts and the necessary joke afterward.I personally found myself in a mixture of the good old 'Die Hard'-times along some candy-for-the-eye-moments and some of the best realistic stunts ever made. Remember, realistic is flexible. And then, don't forget the depth.I was near hurling when I watched 'Die another day'. It seemed that director Lee Tamahori imitated Mel Brooks. With that in the back of the mind, some improvement surely happened. But I personally wish for the golden middle between 'Casino Royale' and 'Die another day'. And I want Q back.There's not much to complain about the handcrafts in this movie. All the actors do a good job, the action is decent, the plot is full and plausible, the settings are, as usual, gigantic post cards and camera, light, cuts, everything works good.I'd give a 6.5, if possible, but a 7 is also adequate.",7,0,1,2 December 2006
High Fidelity," A movie, I consider a 'friend', not a 'film'
","I really do so. My favorite movie. The one, I like more than 'Fight Club', 'Once upon a Time in the West', 'American Beauty', 'Army of Darkness' and all the other highlights. Why? Because it's just an honest, funny portrait of a regular guy, struggling in his life, tortured by love, trying to find his place. And I like this regular guy. I have this regular guy in me too! I wonder how people can call this film boring. Every scene is packed with some of the finest dialog ever written, along with a fresh, natural romance and some all-day workingman drama. But then again, some people call 'Team America' a propaganda movie...Don't worry, just wonder, we say.For those of you, who like the movie too, get yourself the book. It's better.I feel like watching 'High Fidelity' now. See you later.",8,0,1,2 December 2006
