The Hangover," A one - note comedy... a flawless one.
","Where to begin? Guess I could start with the evolution of raunchy, R - rated yet smart high-concept comedies where three - dimensional key characters must deal with over - blown situations and charicatured characters in modern - day America, learning lessons in life in the end. These include such modern classics as American Pie, There's something about Mary and about a dozen examples by Judd Apatow and co. in the last five years. However, this would be just tooting my own horn, and since most of you have seen those movies, who gives a rat's a$$?So, here we have the latest inclusion: a comedy about three guys waking up in a terrible hangover in Vegas, only to realize they have lost the groom along with their memory in a barchelor party gone way out of the map, and that they have only about 48 hours to find him and get to the wedding. Directed by Todd Phillips, who also gave us 'Road trip' (and which I've always considered superior to 'American pie' for the sake that 'RT' is just more laid-back).Unlike for example most of Apatow's comedies, 'The Hangover' is not 'smarter' than what the premise lets you in on. You can't break it down to analyze it, because it's just what the one - line description says. I guess the film-makers considered two choices: re-write it and force it into the successful 'Apatow' mold, or play it out like it is: like an 'eighties' comedy. They did the latter, and with that, the right choice.The Hangover's biggest assets are that it's been crafted to the hilt on all distinctive areas: - The characters. When you meet them at first, you go like 'ok, so they are not clear caricatures, but how could these guys ever be friends?'. But, along the movie, you grow into accepting them, with their pros and cons. You get to recognize their roles and how they 'complete a full circle' without it being too obvious from the get-go. Huge plus.<ul><li>The dialogue. Well, the usual Kevin Smith/Judd Apatow - stuff. Kind of like 'Friends' but with F - words and pop culture references. Good stuff, though.</li></ul><ul><li>Plot. The whole thing plays out like a good mystery and gives a 100 minutes of laughs without missing one beat, losing pace or losing focus (basically this is what 'Dude, where's my car', SHOULD have been). Let's just repeat the thing that really struck me in 'The Hangover': there are no lulls. This, I consider a defining strength: when one clue has been solved, it moves straight into the next one. The 'ok...what now?' - bits have been surgically removed. Also, you will NOT check your watch when the film moves from the second act to the third. Now THIS is rare.</li></ul>Gotta hand it also to Phillips (whose best movie so far) and to the cast - along with castING. Bold having this many new names in key roles.8 out of 10 stars. Hope they won't ruin this with the already green-lit sequel.",8,3,6,2 August 2009
The Ring," Jesus!! (spoilers)
","Now this flick will definitely scare the sh*t out of you! Demonstrate it for you on a 'scary' scale from 1-10: Evil Dead/House on haunted hill ('99) = 6, What lies Beneath = 7½, Signs/Exorcist = 8½, The Ring = right off the scale! If you are a wannabe (or perhaps to-be someday) horror movie director, I seriously suggest you give this a viewing, since this is by far the best example of getting the maximal effect out of minimal effects. Gore Verbinski, you a re a true genius. The plot has very much potential (just happens I had this idea of a net site that pops up randomly causing deaths... oh well...), but it's the sense for visuals of Verbinski that REALLY boosts it all up. And talk about the ending... that b&w chick coming through the TV screen is just one haunting image and an instant classic, deserving its place right up there with similar over-the top scenes in horror genre like 'The chestburster' from 'Alien', 'Michael's gone' in the end of 'Halloween' and 'the twisting head' from 'The Exorcist', just to name but a few. BTW, after seeing 'The ring', I just can't take my eyes off the TV screen when it's not on... I swear, if it happened to turn on showing static, I'd die of a heart attack.",9,1,1,14 April 2003
Alien: Resurrection," Can you tolerate the joke?
","I confess: I actually kinda like this flick. And I understand people who hate it (both the film and my liking to it), very well. This isn't a *proper* flick to continue the alien - saga. This is more like a hack'n'slash - parody of the whole thing, more fitting for us gore hounds and slasher fans than the ones who like the serious cyberpunk/sci-fi/horror - tone of the first two. The approach of director Jeunet to Aliens (TM) is truly very different from what we have seen in the first three: it's optimistic (almost up to a point of being 'lighthearted'); highly enlighten instead of things happening in the dark; and way too grislingly blood'n'guts-gory to be taken seriously. Instead of horror we've got one-liners like for crying out loud! To sum it up: check this out ONLY if you can tolerate a sequel that - in a 'good way' (if there is one) - gets its drive by throwing cream cakes at its predecessors.",Null,0,0,27 July 2004
Spider-Man 2," Ahem... 7/10 points with reservation (major spoilers ahead)
","I really shouldn't go on commenting this movie yet. I should wait after a second viewing to get a few things straight, but lacking better things to do at the moment, here goes...So, here we have it. One of the biggest, many say THE biggest movie event of the year, 2004. Saw it and liked it as much as the next man, but in the big elements there are some little things that lately have really started to bother me. - The action. Still trying a little too hard to be the coolest and wildest ride there is. Since this is literally a comic-book action/adventure movie, most of it hits mark, but sometimes it gets (dare I say it) laughable. At some points it also seems to control, rather than support, the story.<ul><li>The Villain. Molina is terrific, but didn't we already see this guy in a different suit in the first movie? A mad scientist who falls victim for his own ground-breaking invention after putting himself as a guinea-pig? And in the end he 'becomes good again'. Also the 'anticlimax' rings a bell...</li></ul><ul><li>Stars and supporting actors work well, but the rest of N.Y. doesn't quite strike real. People are too 'good'. A pat on the back after 9/11, but this movie isn't supposed for the people of N.Y. only...</li></ul>I'll save you from the rest of my nag-list. On the upside, this movie sets an example for a smooth and harmonic, well-rolling, feel-good,  movie. The actors are great and in popcorn-terms it's all grade A+ Entertainment with a capital E. Most likely this will be looked as the 'Empire strikes back' of Spiderman - trilogy: the one with the most multi-layered characterization. HOWEVER, if instead this will be looked as the movie that gave sequels a bad name again, you all remember that it was me who pointed out the faults of this movie first :)",Null,0,0,13 July 2004
Blade," Oh yeah...
","'Blade' certainly delivers! A full-blooded action-packed gore galore! We got Wesley Snipes hacking up vampires to pieces with style and to a pumping hard trance- soundtrack. This is the kind of film that you end up watching if it comes out on TV, even if you already own a copy of it!Watch the 'Trivia'-section to find out how they almost ended up screwing this good head-start of comic-book action heroes to silver screen (LL Cool J as Blade, eh!)And, believe or not, the sequel is even better! Wish I was this cool...",Null,7,16,8 June 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," Highly entertaining
","That is, in speaking terms of modern DISASTER MOVIES. Fans of high-brow-cinema are bound to be disappointed, but they also should know better than to stay away from GENRE movies. Such as this, low grade action, slashers and porn. So here we have your basic disaster movie. The plot is the same as always: an everyman scientist knows that a volcano/earthquake/tsunami(whatever) is about to strike an inhabited area or that a nearby dam/bridge is about to collapse. He tries to warn people and get them to evacuate, but no-one believes him. However, he himself can't leave because his ex-wife/love interest/kid is in jeopardy. The disaster strikes, killing 90% of the people. The rest of the movie we follow a nuclear group, led by the scientist and usually accompanied by a smart dog, fighting to get out of the situation. We also see at least one good soul sacrificing his life for the common good *snif*.Basically, all you need to know in movies like this are the following: - Did the casting do a good job and can the actors get something out of their cardboard characters. Here: YES - Are the effects any good? Here: YES - Boring patronizing or good-natured roller-coaster-ride. Here: LATTER - Is the situation believable. Here: NO. But it does have a point. Environmental message, but not rubbed on your face. Unless you want to take it that way...As a bonus - No damn dogs on sight! - Tongue in cheek- humor. Might be unintentional, but I like it anyway.",Null,1,2,24 May 2005
Ready Player One," Hands down the best Spielberg genre movie since 'Saving private Ryan'
","Yes, I've said it!I actually wrote a longer intro for this... but then just decided to drop it. I mean, whats the point dissing 'Crystal skull'; and/or nitpicking about the shortcomings of the source material (I read the novel 4 years ago and rated 7/10 with a verdict 'utterly unfilmable')... when the outcome is - against all odds - is a solid eight out of ten!Yes - I've said it. A strong EIGHT. And a sign that mr. Spielberg doesn't need my support.For those who disagree - and there seems to be a lot of them - I have a question: WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?
All the adds said 'based on a novel of a holy grail of pop culture'. Did you all just happen to miss the fact that we're talkin FANTASY fiction instead f sci-fi, with major basis on 80s nostalgia. For you hardcore sci/fi- fans, there's movie you might want to check out. It's called '2049'. you should check it out.
But t
I could give 'Taxi driver' a 1/10 and that despite it's name it doesn't tell about commuting.My two cents are, that the screenplay (by Zan Penn and Ernest Cline) is a vast improvement in the source material, and that Spielberg's knowing/experienced (do I need to even explain?) direction lifts this movie... well, beyond its fan-based roots. I mean",8,0,1,31 March 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," 'That Spielberg guy can make pretty good movies'
","As quoted by my 8-year old son right after seeing this, Spielberg's latest movie. Well, ditto. The Adventures of Tintin: The secret of the unicorn is one damn fine adventure yarn and by far the most enjoyable entertainment movie from mr. Spielberg since the original Jurassic Park (-93). Technically it's nothing but well made but production values aside, this movie has a HEART. A honest, warm heart. Something Spielberg's offerings have been lacking for a long time. After Spielberg's 'serious season' I found his 'War of the worlds' to be cold and cynical. After the travesty of 'Indy 4' I was afraid he's just lost his 'honest touch' for good. For Tintin I had hopes, but dared not to expect much more than trivial entertainment with fancy graphics. Well, I'm happy to say I got more than I bargained for. Sure we got the best eye-popping technology money can buy, and a polished script, but above all, I say above all, this movie made me feel like a kid again. our basic movie night turned out to offer some great dad & son - time. Provided by Herge, Spielberg & Jackson. Thanks, guys, we'll be waiting for the sequel!PS. I believe the prolonged 30-year wait helped the movie. First of all, there's technology: only this way the look is right. Peter Jackson was right to persuade Spielberg out of the live-action option. And before Avatar this look wouldn't have been possible. Second, the geeks. Now we got 30+yo fanboys, comic-cons and a ton of movies from comic books to prove that there's money to be made if you invest in a movie from a comic. And that you get better feedback the more loyal you stay to the source material. Third, I think a younger Spielberg would have been too cocky to do it right. Age and a couple of misfires (especially Indy 4) can teach you a few lessons about film - making.",Null,1,4,13 November 2011
The Expendables," Exactly what it's advertised to be
","Yep. Whenever I come across a bad genre movie, fanboys shout out 'what did you expect?'. Well, Expendables is a *GOOD* genre movie, and if anyone has anything bad to say about it, he's definitely in the wrong crowd. This IS supposed to be loud, dumb fun. A machismo over-the-top hailback to the 80s: nil plot, full-on action. Testosterone calls all the shots while female characters exist only as excuses for 'men of action' to nix cardboard-cutout baddies in three-digit numbers. Bad guys miss, good guys walk heads up high and never-ending clips in their guns and mow them down. Dialogue exists not to flesh out characters, but to produce one-liners. Yes, I had fun watching this. Solid stuff which provides exactly what it promises. The old school action stars missing this one out (mainly Kurt Russell, Wesley Snipes, Steven Seagal and Van Damme) deserve a kick in the butt for doing so. But I still hope to see them in Expendables II. Especially Russell (c'mon, 'Tango and Cash', mother fo!).",7,2,8,24 August 2010
Final Destination 2," Gore galore
","Ohmigod! I always thought that 'FD1' and 'House on haunted hill '99' were the best INNOVATIVE outcomes of the 'post-Scream' era in splatter genre. I'm not taking (the ingenious) 'Scream 2', (the good-cardboard-copy-of-'Scream') 'I know...', (the good parody) 'I still know...' and (the good funeral episode) 'H20' into account, since they are not that innovative, just good in their own 'just going through the numbers' - madman on the loose category. So, after 'FD1' I thought 'FD2' was a serious mistake. It's like throwing dirt on the little bright spot that shines out of the cess pool representing the state of current splatter, almost buried under titles such as 'Halloween 8', 'Wrong turn' and 'Urban Legend 2' -need I go on? All right, all right, we are seeing a little light at the end of the tunnel with such titles as 'JvsF' and 'Cabin Fever'... Well, back to 'FD2', I was glad to be wrong! 'Coz here we have it, dear gorehounds, without a doubt the bloodiest and most twisted horror comedy of the year! You REALLY get for what you are paying for in here! Good old in-your-face gore and blood spurts! Hilarious stuff. Also the actors aren't half bad and the plot don't stink. I'm giving serious thought of actually purchasing this gem on DVD.",Null,0,0,27 February 2004
Blade II," Even better than the first one!
","A Full-blooded gore galore 2-hour roller-coaster ride! That's all I gotta say about this film and I'm going to stick to it.Easily a 9/10 points film, only 2 complaints: *WARNING, POSSIBLE SPOILERS*1) The Uber-vampires are once again harder than anything when introduced: one can take on dozens of 'normal' vampires, but later on they 'grow weak' (In the sewers 2 NORMAL vampires are capable of taking on hordes and hordes of ubers! And Blade himself takes them on with just one hand standing on a small cliff where the uber's seem to be unable to climb or jump onto at the moment!)2) The music... yet again and once for all: would Hollywood finally believe that DURING ACTION RAP AS BACKGROUND MUSIC SIMPLY DON'T WORK!! During preparations, yes. During testosterone-indulging conversations, yes. But during ACTION - BIG NO! Heavy tunes, heavy tunes- either rock (Worked beautifully in Crow) or techno / hard trance (works best, as seen in Blade 1, Replacement killers etc.) And a word about the using of trance: before putting on anything that sounds cool in that side of the Atlantic, ask an opinion about it from Europe. 'Confusion' [P.P.R. RMX] was a lucky shot in the beginning of Blade 1, but 'Blood Is Pumping' by Voodoo & Serano in Blade 2 is not just VERY old news in here, it's also a bad example of a rip-off remake (the original is  'Up to no Good' by Porn Kings). Just from the top of my head I could have given the makers half a dozen better tunes to play in the rave scene. So, for the next time, give me a call :)",9,0,12,24 June 2002
21 Jump Street," A surprisingly good comedy
","This one worked for me as good as 'The other guys'. I assume the two people who read this review are familiar with the plot, so I'll just lay down the goodies. Script = smart. There's a plot onto which the jokes are glued on, and not vice versa. It works both on the meta - level (parody) as also a conventional comedy. The emotional spots and parts where it digs into the 'nerds vs. hunks' - setting is good, and it truly rises above the material when it analyzes friendships. Acting = spot on. Jonah Hill delivers his usual goods and wisely gives more light to - applause - Tatum Channing. This guy has charisma and has managed to carve out his niche in both drama and action roles. Now he delivers an absolutely hilarious comedic performance out of the bushes. L-effin-OL. Deadpan, check. Timing, check. Also, he isn't trying to steal scenes (Will Smith- style) and is game even when his character is the butt of the jokes. Watching him is like watching an R-rated version of Joey from 'Friends'.It's a bit shy on the action, but it pays off with comedy. The chemistry between Hill & Channing is exceptional so I'm really looking forward to see a sequel.",7,2,3,28 May 2012
The Bourne Identity," Does right what 'The Saint' did wrong (spoilers)
","I like Matt Damon and I like the older James Bond-movies = I liked 'The Bourne Identity'. The director understood that in suspense thrillers less is more and didn't go for no 'Triple X'-bulls**t, but instead, set some nice little action scenes, like the escape from embassy and oh, the cat'n'mouse with the sniper in the field - straight out of some 70s' spy movie! I could almost imagine the same situation played with, say Gene Hackman or, Michael Caine... great stuff! Minimal yet effective. The final shootout was one click too close to ridicule'- hope they would have tuned it down that much (you now what part I mean), and added in, say, 2-3 more bad guys... but that's just me bitching. Also nothing wrong with the car-wrecking action, just that after 'Ronin'... However, the two REAL down-sides of the movie are: 1) The 'Headquarter'-stuff was straight out of a bad B-movie.'What's the French word for 'Stakeout'?'- aw, c'mon! Please, we've seen that 'p***ed of captain'-act in a hundred buddy-cop actioners! One might think Chris Cooper is a bad actor if he wouldn't have just received an oscar. And if one hadn't seen 'American beauty'. 2) Why is Wombosi portrayed in a wide-eyed comic-book style? Seriously out of style!But, as a whole, this flick is well worthy of purchase.",Null,0,1,13 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Overhyped
","This and 'Crouching Tiger, hidden Dragon'... both critics and everymen, literally EVERYBODY, hype 'em up and give them straight 'A''s all the way. And lil' me just doesn't get it.'Fellowship' is more than an okay fantasy tale, maybe 7 or 8 out of 10. Gets points for NOT being childish but is definitely too long (I haven't read the book)'Crouching...' gets boring earlier, mostly due to an unnecessary overlonged romantic (soapy) side-plot, BUT there's the always charismatic Chow Yun-Fat in the lead role and some fast-paced kung-fu- action, so a 6 or 7 out of 10 is probably right.Now, every OTHER review I read from the two movies above, all they get are 'Five stars' and '10/10''s. Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing against them and they're both okay. But just that- seeing them after the massive hype gave me the 'That's it?' blues. Now if you ask me - for a better fantasy tale check out 'Star Wars' and for a better historic Kung-Fu- epic, Jet Li's 'Once Upon a Time in China'.",Null,0,1,7 May 2002
The Thing," 'Alien' clone? (spoilers)
","Whoa! Seeing this, one of my all-time horror favorites, amongst the top 250 movies of all times just made me want to pay my respects to it. I admit it's a bit out of its league amongst movies like 'Braveheart' and the original 'Star wars trilogy', but nonetheless 'The Thing' is a very, very, VERY good piece of horror. And easily one of John Carpenter's best ones. If you want to be nasty, you can say it's only a clone of 'Alien', but there's more. What makes the difference for me are The setting - location adds to the common theme of isolation, and also to the nihilistic and dark mood; when the last survivors gather, you know they'll just freeze to death after fade out.Characterization is done well. Everyone on the station has a post, a job and responsibility. So, even though Kurt Russell is clearly the lead, the rest aren't just cardboard fodder. They are as potential clones, as potential next victims - and as potential survivors towards the end. Keeps you guessing. Well - written, just like in 'Alien' or in 'Scream'.Benchmark in gory and eye-popping FX. What can I say? Everyone brings this up :D Surely some of the effects are now dated, but on the other hand, some are still very convincing. Not bad for an effects - ridden flick that's nearly quarter of a century old.",8,0,1,29 March 2006
The Village," Hmmm... (Spoilers ahead)
","In order to keep this short I'll skip the introduction i.e. the synopsis. By now everybody knows the premise, so I'll feel free to just cut to the chase, my thoughts of 'the Village'. Problems with the movie are, as follows: 1) Definitely overlong. Pretty much nothing (scary, that is) happens the first hour through. Who needs an hour long introduction anyway? Maybe M.Night felt forced to 'give everybody room' after he realized that he's got 'too big a cast' - even the town crazy is played by a fresh Academy Award (tm) winner. OR, maybe M.Night realized that this time his (tm) Big Surprise At the End can be guessed too easily on and tried to 'play time' or divert the viewer from guessing. If that's the case, he failed. 2) The overall feeling is so heavy (not to mention that first half is slllloooowwwww) it almost suffocates the whole movie. Where's the humour? 3) Casting is odd. 4) Music grows annoying (if I hear so much as one more note played with a damn violin this year, I'm going to kill somebody!) And the good sh*t, as follows. 1) The movie isn't 'bad'. It's 'odd'. 2) Original, if something. But not THAT interesting (at least after that first hour...) 3) Does deliver a reasonable amount of scares. 4) Well photographed. If you want to be a horror- director someday, you should check here how to make plain woods seem scary or use music to stage scenes.I don't count the 'too easily guessable end surprise' as a demerit, since it shouldn't of have been the point here (good scares should be the point). But it's a pity the movie itself doesn't see it this way and instead uses too much of its potential trying to keep the surprise at the end. And failing in it. Without a doubt Shyamalan's worst. 3 out of 5.",Null,0,1,28 September 2004
Pitch Black," Rocks and kicks A**! (minor spoilers)
","People who call this movie bad deserve a slap across the face! I was GOING to say, 'deserve to be dragged behind the barn and shot', but I don't want my piece of work here to go unpublished just because of a notion like that!'Pitch black' is simply one of the best B-movies I have ever seen, IF not the best - tightly written, well-acted and esPECIALLY well directed! (note: I can't believe the below par B-horror conveniently called 'Below' was directed by Twohy also). If I MUST complain (which I surely wouldn't want to do), then some of the actors could be better. They aren't bad, just simply not up to Diesel... Well, what do you get with this budget? Better ones than in 'Cube', and you remember how good that one still was. Also the idea, however well used, ain't that original.But back to the good news- the script, director and cast make it all work for MORE than what it's worth! Everything falls in it's place and the result is scary, hip and funny - when it wants to be.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The bad apple (Spoilers)
","I told you, I told you, I told you: T3 ended up being a real stinker! Though even I didn't predict it to be this bad...however, this proves my rule of movie series: either the first (Back to the future part 2, Elm street 2 etc.) OR the second sequel (Scream 3, Lethal Weapon 3 etc.) end up being unable to live up to the original. The only exceptions so far are the Die Hard and the Star wars trilogies. I sincerely hope I can add Charlie's Angels 3, Matrix 3 and Blade 3 on my exceptions list in the near future...But back to T3: the plot is not that bad, but it's so filled with (bad) jokes and plotholes that sometimes you're not sure if this is supposed to be a spoof. At the end we get to some good ol' stuff, like the machines taking over and Arnie vs. the TX, but this is taken away with Arnie fighting with himself- bad idea, bad acting. I strongly believe that the original idea there had Arnie going bad and that the last fight was supposed to be between John vs. bad Arnie, but that this was scrapped because a test audience consisting of 1.000 pot-headed teenagers who had never seen T1 thought it's too dark. Right.In my opinion the end would have also been better without throughout explanations: the pair gets to the basement, find out it's not skynet, figure out Arnie tricked them there to be safe and the camera pans away as they're listening to the end of the world. Dark like (the original) Planet of the apes.I don't know what this is, but it sure don't feel like the other terminator movies. Cameron, Hamilton and even Furlong are solely missed, plus Fiedel's score.So could someone explain me whatta hell is this 7,2/10 rating?? A national inside joke???",Null,0,0,22 July 2003
Jarhead," Jarhead - just another war movie
","Mediocre war movie. You know how they go: first half training, second half fighting. Hard to believe these days someone would still use the old 80s formula... let alone trade the action of the latter half to 'making a point'. Please! Sure I care for the characters but 10 bucks for politics instead of fireworks in a war movie - that's a cheat! This story is better off as a book, but I guess 'somehow' Hollywood is obliged to release a big budget war movie every so often...To put it short, 'Jarhead' criticizes the war on Iraq. In a way the superior 'Three kings' already did 6 years ago, minus the action, minus half the entertainment, minus half the story... yes, *sigh*. Well, you don't actually need to get a pillow for this (except maybe for the last 10 minutes when they *try to* sum it up) because there are some truly effective scenes, but as a whole it lacks punch. As did Sam Mendes' previous attempt, 'Road to Perdition'. Makes me wonder if 'American beauty' had really been (even) that good without Kevin Spacey. Gyllenhaal gives a fine performance (doesn't he always) but he can't save this film.",5,0,1,10 May 2006
Resident Evil," Aaarghh! (spoilers)
","I would have LOVED to see G.A. Romero make a comeback with a 'Resident Evil' movie: zombies are his territory and he would have been able to pull some depth to it. Everything would have clicked, sure hit.INSTEAD, the producers handed R.E. to Paul 'I've only directed flops' Anderson who (as we all saw) had NO originality and NO perception for this matter whatsoever. His approach reminded me of that such of a kid's in a candy store: 'ooh we got to squeeze in these cool elements (the train, the dogs, the monster in the end) from the game, and we got to put in some matrix-type action and ooh I saw this cool death-scene in the beginning of 'Cube' and, and... oh yeah, we need a talking computer! With a hologram!''Excuse me, mr. Anderson, but we can't fit them all into a 90-minute movie''SURE WE CAN! We just cut the suspense and the zombie on-screen time!'Yeah. Of a zombie horror movie. I don't think RE was all that bad though, a 5 out of 10 = watchable.It just p***es me off that the producers don't seem to be taking us 'old school' horror fans seriously. I mean, would hiring Romero have been too big an investment? Or didn't they want the material be too controversial? With Romero this could of NOT have been less than a 7 out of 10 movie! Probably even a new 'Dawn OTD'...? Definitely something to give MPAA and purists gray hair, for a long time :)What saddens me furthermore is, they'll (the producers) most likely end up screwing the upcoming Jason vs. Freddy all over: 'Hey guys, we could save 10c by rewriting Alice and Tommy off! I mean, who remembers them anyway? And while we're at it, let's change Robert Englund with another actor, C'MON, NO-ONE WILL NOTICE!' Go ahead, make it a PG-13 movie while you are at it, to attract more viewers to it.",Null,8,17,11 January 2003
Alien vs. Predator," Horrendous
","Well this just did it - as long as I live, I don't want to see another movie directed by mr Paul Anderson. I'm sure that off work he's cool. He likes horror, action and games so he can't be all bad. There's no denying he'd make a heck of a producer - none of the old farts in Hollywood would have never in a million years come up with the idea to make movies like 'Resident evil' or 'Alien versus Predator', even when they've been hanging in front of everyone's faces from day one! Paul also seems to have an idea or two when it comes to writing scripts, but unfortunately, that's it. Dear God keep this man 50, no make that a hundred, yards from a movie camera! I so much wanted to like AvP, but what can you do? Except admit the sad fact that Anderson fumbled the ball again. There's no excuse for the crap that's tarnishing the celluloid. A few amusing minutes on a movie don't make up for the rest 86 minutes of sheer pain. The fact that the original version was mutilated to a PG-13-edit is the least of the problems here. Who the hell wants to see big-budget 'horror' - movies with actors that can't act, stupid dialogue, plot holes/illogical turns and Z-grade directing anyway? I thought they stopped making movies this poorly something like 20 years ago. Or at least they should have stopped! Jason vs Freddy was actually scarier (not to mention WAY much better), and it was a parody for crying out loud! All that's missing from AvP is 'the annoying 12-year-old who's also the comic relief'. You know, the one who gets to say the last joke before the credits.",Null,0,0,19 September 2004
Saving Private Ryan," Stunning (minor spoilers)
","When I went to see this flick, I had heard all the rumours about the beginning of this movie. I consider myself to have a strong stomach for silver-screen violence, so I thought to myself 'what could Spielberg, 'mr. Fairy-tale', of all people, shove on my face'. Well, 30 minutes of unrelenting full-blooded grindhouse gore was NOT anything I could have prepared myself for! I don't think there's anyone in the world who can take the beginning of SPR easily. I bet even guys like Paul 'I said more blood, you faggots!' Verhoeven ended up thinkin 'this sh*t is heavy!' You'll be stunned, you'll FEEL the horror and you'll end up watching helplessly as Spielberg and his team introduce you to the face of war! This is NOT entertainment with a bunch of grown-up kids cowboying it on the 'Krauts', this is sadistic, mindless and brutal, just like the real thing. After the start things slow down just a little bit as the plot unravels, but Spielberg manages easily in staying miles away from his fairy-tale-telling alter ego. And in the end... well, here we go again. If this was a regular action flick, you'd be waiting for the big finale. This time you are so much rooting for the soldiers you hope they would get away without having to fight anymore. BUT, Steven keeps it real to the end and in the grand fnale, bombards the viewer emotionally to the ground! Only two minor complaints: close-up on the american flag (yea, yea, heroes,'land of the free' etc.) and some light moments at the end ('the last speech of the dying hero' - cliche...) taste a bit fake in this otherly very heavy movie. I also am not so sure if portraying Germans again as back-stabbing S.O.B.:s is that good a choice. And I hate Sizemore in this, but this gets payed back by the surprisingly good performance of Ed Burns.10- / 10",Null,0,0,28 June 2003
The Descent," A good one!
","After 'Dog soldiers' I knew this guy's next movie will (also) rock! So when 'Descent' hit the theaters here I didn't hesitate: I went to see it having let my expectations pretty high - and didn't have to walk out disappointed! Basically Descent is just a by-the-numbers horror movie: starts off with a tragedy, then introduces us the 6 key characters who all have different personalities so that it's more like a small society (a la Alien). They try to get their minds off past things but become prey for something evil... and as thing move on we learn that their unprocessed history, the evil WITHIN, might pose an even worse threat... etc. etc. The structure is an umpteenth variation of that used in the original 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre', 'Hills have eyes', 'I know what you did last summer' and so on, but whereas the usual clones and remakes usually fail to get anything new out of this old mold, 'Descent' succeeds. Most importantly: the scares work. Oh yeah :) The scariest movie of the year, no competition. (Can't compare to 'Saw 2' since it's a thriller). Second: I don't know how this one guy wrote that dialog for all six WOMEN, but it's just perfect. Also the actresses do a fine job- but only because they were directed well! Score, photography, editing... two thumbs up. I also liked the pale, 'autumnly' look of the film. Great choice, adds a helluva lot to the mood! This may come as a surprise, but yea, there was also a lot, and I mean A LOT, of blood. Violence factor is right up there with 'From dusk till dawn': we got heads smashed until they literally crack open, we got the good ol' 'thumbs through the eyes', slit throats, you name it. But this surplus of gore doesn't add to the film. Either the makers sort of 'got cold feet' :( or then they just didn't want to sacrifice any of their sick ideas :) Usually it's the lack of gore I complain about but this time... a minor complain. Slap on the wrist. Still to sum things up a small winner all around! DEFINITELY going to buy the DVD. Definitely.",8,0,1,12 January 2006
Zombieland," OMG this is some funny a$$ sh*t!
","Saw it in the movies. Loved it. Bought the DVD. Just watched it => felt obliged to spend my 2 cents on it. I think this along with the original 'Dawn if the dead' are two of the best zombie movies ever, period: DotD delivers the message with blood n guts, ZL delivers the laughs with blood and guts... and some. On the surface, this is like 'Hatchet' with Zombies with some of that post-Scream self-aware. But I'm also willing to claim that under the surface, there's more: I would go so far as to say that this is like both a parody and a right-on-the-spot take on the post generation-X comedies... a Kevin Smith movie, 'Dazed and confused'... or perhaps, most fittingly, 'Say anything' with zombies. Jesse Eisenberg is perfectly cast as 'Columbus', a geek who gets a rude awakening into a world suddenly overrun by flesh-eating corpses. Woody Harrelson is perfectly cast as a trigger-happy mentor who picks Columbus as his sidekick. And Emma Stone... perfectly cast, playing the damsel in distress/ femme fetale along with... (sorry. I just got lost in her reindeer-in-the-spotlight eyes. Did I mention she's perfectly cast?) with an okay Abigail Breslin on her tow. That's about all you need to know. Won't spoil you the fun, but all I can tell you that there's plenty of it: I'm an 34 year-old Finn with a master's degree, and I laughed my ass off along with all the 18-year-olds in the crowd. 'Zombieland' instantly got into one of my top-five experiences in a movie theatre. Can't wait for the sequel!",8,1,3,17 September 2010
Die Hard," You are a policeman. There are rules for policemen
","The top eight action flicks of the eighties: 'The Terminator', 'First Blood', 'Aliens', 'Robocop', 'the Predator', 'Lethal Weapon 1 & 2'- and 'Die Hard'. Probably the least action-packed of the titles mentioned above, but I think it's the best of them! Always a pleasure to watch (done it already like 30 times or so) because it just clicks on every level: the direction is all good, the setting is original and well used (another bow to the director), the hero is physically limited (a little love handle around the stomach, maybe?) and vulnerable (and not just physically- the moment where McClane talks to Powell about delivering a message to his wife IS touching) and the villains are terrific, by the way there are 13 of them, not 12!If you view one of the early trailers of 'Die Hard' you see that the movie was marketed like just another 'reaganish'-action yarn; 'all-action, with an all-American hero kicking and especially shooting the s**t out of about a thousand foreign baddies in the name of apple pie and family values'. Surprising is that even when this movie WAS done in times like those, it has been done in a different tone, the outcome being something like a 'thinking man's action yarn' with a slow pace (that still grows up into a climax), a nasty sense of violence and even a partial touch of realism. Probably this was because Ahnuld stepped out of the project and they had to make a brand new mold for Willis (who prevents Rickman from stealing the show with 'Hans Gruber' by putting a little dark humor to John McClane, and giving him some of the coolest one-liners I've ever heard!) Whatever the reason, the gambling paid off and the outcome was a movie that doesn't seem to age off...The sequels are both above par, but still clearly below the original DIE HARD.",9,1,2,27 August 2001
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," The hell are you giving this movie good votes for, people!?
","Because it's horrible, awful, BS, pure cr@p! I just don't understand people who pay their good money for a mental 'Deliverance' - treatment with this BS, and won't even admit it! Yes, people, we were screwed! Hard! Instead, they get back here and give this DOA flick 6, 7 stars, because 'it wasn't boring. And because the popcorn tasted good'. G-sus, people! Like a bunch of wussies against two school bullies that are Bay and Spielberg! I can not believe last year we were treated with summer movies like 'Batman II' that got its bucks deservingly, and now this cr@p is NOT flopping, because 'everyone says it's this summer's must-see'. I didn't like the first one, but I gave this a chance. Last time they were testing the CGI, the characters, the budget. Now they were secured - and they could have spend all the time ON the characters, on the plot, on everything.They didn't. It's blurry effects, no plot, stupid coincidences and all that cr@p that didn't work in the first part, ALL OVER AGAIN! Just with a bigger budget. In a perfect world word-of-mouth would kill these sorry-ass attempts before they make a profit.Misters Bay & Spielberg - shame on you. Spielberg - you've lost your keen eye and have demented from the gifted child - minded revisionist into an overbloated megalomaniac who can't tell the difference between touching fantasy and childish melodrama anymore. Bay, from your days of 'Bad Boys' and 'Rock', you've just kept losing your magic, and now it's gone. Both of you forget directing, forget executive, stick to just producing from now on.",2,30,70,28 June 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Good, solid action adventure!
","Wow! For the past last month, I've been catching up on movies I missed on the big screen last year. So far 'Sherlock Holmes' seems to have been the best thing I missed. Sometimes I wonder who the hell calls the shots in Hollywood. I mean, Guy Ritchie to direct a big action genre movie? But hell, I also like it when I'm wrong, especially when I expect to see an IMDb 6 movie and get an IMDb 8 one! To sum it up, this is what 'Wild wild west' should have been, and more! It delivers on the grass-roots level as well as on big scale entertainment. I liked the plot, I liked the treatment (opens up like a Sherlock Holmes novel with all elements falling into place in the end), I liked the casting... everything. And about Ritchie's straight involvement: I loved every single frame of this movie. I mean, this movie FLOWED. Great stuff. Give me Sherlock Holmes. With the same director, please.",8,0,3,24 August 2010
Signs," The all-time second scariest film (after the Exorcist) SPOILERS
","Yup. This one definitely worked for me. Found myself squeezing the handles white-knuckled most of the time. The idea is not that original (the TV-series 'V'), but I don't recall anyone using the signs-in-the-cornfields- idea before. Also directing and screenplay are brilliant- it's amazing how, in a production the size of this, little they invested in the aliens. And regarding, how such a tense atmosphere they managed to create. Let's see: all they needed was ONE guy in an alien suit for footage of about 4 minutes, and some grady, low-quality 'news-footage' - of lights in the sky! Of course, in horror flicks often more is less, since what you CAN'T see is scarier than what you DO see and goes for this, too, for the last reel... but for horror-fans, here is a perfect example of minimazing the income and maximazing the outcome- 'The Signs' is truly the work of an undeniable genius!P.S. Did anyone of you whiners think that it might of not been just the H2O that kills these aliens? Maybe it's the dissolved ions in it that are present on Earth (that is, in the 1)tap water of 2)Earth), or the pH... or the amoebas? (All that water in the glasses was more than 24 hours old)",9,0,1,18 September 2002
Final Destination," Worth your while
","Alongside 'House on Haunted Hill', this is one of the better follow-ups in the line of 'new' teen slasher horror flicks (starting from, of course, 'Scream'). What could I say? The acting is, in slasher terms, fine; especially the hero (Alex, played by Devon Sawa) gives a touching performance. Directing is good, but towards the end a bit too hectic - with a little less rushing the director might of had juiced up a bit more 'horror'. Then on the other side, at least it's never boring.BTW, as the original ending has more balls (see it on DVD), the re-shot, '2nd', ending is propably the best 'recovery' I've ever seen! Compare it with, for example, the too fast-paced re-shot final of 'Die Hard 3'!",7,0,2,12 November 2001
Slumdog Millionaire," More like 'Underdog millionaire'
","One word summary: Amazing.With more then one words: first of all; Mr. Boyle, I'm sorry. I didn't get 'Trainspotting', I taught 'The beach' proved you're mediocre (as a side note: my parents there then, on a holiday near where it was shot) and I also thought that '28 days later' was a lucky shot. 'Slumdog' proves once and for all I have been misjudging you - you DO have the talent. 'Slumdog' is one of those rare examples that come by you only now and then in a lifetime. In my life the earliest example of this was 'E.T.' back when I was 6, and the last time was 'Shaolin soccer' some years back. This year I was already treated with 'Gran Torino', so I REALLY wasn't expecting anything of this level - and hey, it's only February! As a struggling scriptwriter - sort of myself, this has thought me more than just one lesson. The idea of a poor man's journey through life giving him just the right answers for scoring it big on a TV show is a flash of genius, juggling with traditional issues like 'fate' and 'destiny' with those of popular culture. That alone would have secured any British director a sure 6.5 IMDb - point Hugh Grant Box office - hit. And no doubt all but one would have done just that (as would any American director). Now, for some reason, mr. Boyle wanted to put a spin on it (or keep the original premise?), and set it in a foreign culture; India. That's risky. And most who have tried this, have failed... but not in this case. Mr. Boylse handles everything suavely and professionally. He doesn't preach pro or against; instead, he fully accomplishes in taking the best of both worlds as he simply tells the story in another culture.The whole beauty of it, with the whole beauty of it surroundings. In the end, you WILL feel that even if the movie took you in another place to tell the story, that that WAS the place the story was meant to be told in. And that the 2 hours it took to tell it, there wasn't a minute too much.That's rare. And that's a reason to go see this movie.I am truly happy this movie has managed to find an audience, lingering in the top 10 all these weeks (working its way from the bottom up !) and scoring all those 8 Oscars, DESERVINGLY!",Null,3,10,24 February 2009
Back to the Future," Great 80s' montage! (spoilers)
","Back to the future is perhaps the best fantasy/comedy/adventure flick to date! And a great 80s' montage, as well (God, is this really almost 20 years old??). Along, with, of course  'Gremlins', 'Ghostbusters', John Hughes' movies and 'Miami Vice'... But what makes this movie special is, that it seems to have aged a lot less than the other movies of its time - which is a tremendous achievement keeping in mind that this movie somewhat 'boasted' with its time-travel special effects. The trick is, effects shouldn't manipulate the movie. Zemeckis was a genius ahead of his time, too many directors haven't learnt this lesson even yet. Why don't they make movies LIKE THIS anymore? Just set a likeable character (college kids seem to work well) in a predicemen, and let him work and stumble - the balance is essential; needs to be comedic, but not a farce - his way out of it through a 1000 minor and major situations and setbacks. All right, this guy 'grows up to be' an unlikely hero, but do NOT reward him too much in the end (yeah, yeah, 'rolemodels for the kids', blah blah. There is a surplus of 'educational' movies, no need to to be ramming it down everybodys' throats every possible chance!). And do NOT forget the darker issues, even a little grown-up material. Only the really-really-unimportant side characters are to be card-board stereotypes. Special effects come LAST. Keep up the pace, etc etc.BTTF can also boast with its pace: comedic stuff from the starts and about a dozen 'endings': great sentimental peak when George FINALLY punches Biff->We move to Marty having to play the guitar->the kissing scene (with a delay and a twist)->Johnny B. Goode-> and only THEN we move to 'going home' with its problems- more than just a few plus running against the clock... and yet, after the 'happy end' we're left with a great closing scene! Talk about a roller-coaster-ride! Your hands squeezing the nearest pillow. ANY more suspense or action and you'd and up a nerve-rack. Action, adventure and comedy, fitting for all ages. If you don't like this movie, there there just has to be something really wrong with you.",10,1,2,13 April 2003
