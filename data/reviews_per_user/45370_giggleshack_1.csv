The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A beautiful movie with an even better message
","A friend of mine recommended that I see this movie and after finally getting around to it I wonder what took me so long. This is one of those films that excels on a number of fronts and presents us with an overall masterpiece. The cast of mostly young actors and actresses does nothing but impress as they all put forth compelling and refreshing performances that bring unique characters and a delicately written screenplay to life.All in all, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an absolute pleasure and is one of the few movies that stirs your emotions and leaves you inspired and uplifted and in the end reminds you why we all love movies to begin with.",9,0,2,20 January 2016
