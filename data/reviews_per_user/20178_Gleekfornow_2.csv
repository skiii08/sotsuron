The Perks of Being a Wallflower," very relatable and a great watch
","Its like i was meant to watch this movie, this movie is not just for me, its for all those bored teenagers out there. Perks of being a wallflower doesn't just tell a story, this movie stands out from all those terrible lame boring high school movies who don't stick to their plots very well. I don't care if this movie isn't pleasantly rich enough to be listed on the top 250, it changes your life completely, go watch it. I saw it 30 times and counting with my friends and family and they said i had great taste in movies. Its because everyone can relate to this movie just like the breakfast club. This movie will be on my shelf for decades just like when my mom had the breakfast club on her shelf years ago and i will remember the great times watching it because it completed my life.Download it on iTunes, Watch it on Netflix, Watch it online i don't care, its a must see. My perfect rating score and i've been talking about this with my family and we all voted. 8/10.",8,0,0,14 October 2013
