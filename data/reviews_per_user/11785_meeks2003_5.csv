Child 44," Thumbs down!
","A good story totally ruined by a bad director. Great actors have been degraded thanks to Espinosa. English with Russian accent was and always is a terrible idea, especially when you choose the actors that have problems with performance in this made-up-dialect. The story is also misleading the audience a few times in the film making 3-4 stories in the same film, jumping from one to another, with a poor or no explanation in a single part of the movie. At the end I was confused, didn't know how to connect the events into the plot. At first seemed we search for a murders done by Soviet system, then ups!-it's not, there is somebody, a single killer, but seems protected by government (why?who knows!), then we have some stupid short story about drugged nazidivisions which are inserted into the Soviet-system to revenge their defeat in war. At the end- No,again! It is all about a sick ex-soviet officer from the WW2 who is crying at the end end being shot just 2 minutes after showing up in the movie. The movie has been directed as there was a small child behind the scene, not a grown up. TERRIBLE! I give 4/10 just for a good actors team gathered, even their performance was poor, but again thanks to Espinosa.",4,3,8,23 April 2017
Passengers," Very good...
","I watched the movie at home and I must admit I enjoyed it. Actors are very good, plot is very interesting and it's ending is very nice. There are only few actors in whole movie and that's what makes it different and interesting. The star-ship configuration is also very nice, as well as space frontiers. I can't find anything wrong, but feel that something's missing to make the movie really great. I don't know what, but it's probably the ˝Homestead 2˝. We should have seen it, at least a bit of it. But, the story could bee continued on Homestead 2 in next movie, that would be interesting.",8,5,8,25 February 2017
Interstellar," HQ movie!
","Personally, I do like 2h-and-longer movies, but only if they can attract my attention in full durance. This is very very good movie, but I wouldn't say a masterpiece. Why? I expected more convincing turns and twists. Example; When the crew finds out that they were fooled by dr.Brand, it is hardly well explained what kind of purpose leis in their expedition. Dr Brand says there is no hope to find the ˝salvation planet˝ because his equation is insufficient, yet they still have to continue their research, as dr. Mann says: they are the future, not the Earth inhabitants. What's that mean? They will die searching? What's the difference then between them and those left behind??Nolan is one of my favorites, but still something's missing here.",7,0,2,17 October 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," High-class acting!
","The whole cast is just superb. Every role played perfectly! I did not expect the end as shown, yet it does not hurt the complete impression of the movie. Really, really good movie!",8,0,1,11 January 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," Excellent!
","I always can't wait next Gibsons movie and he thrills me every time it shows up. - Classy performance by Garfield, Wothington, Vaughn and the rest of the crew. - Perfectly recorded battle minutes with all the ugly moments that the front line of the battle contains. - Very pleasant romantic moments - A lot of emotions all the way from the beginning until the very end of the film. It is unbelievable how meticulously and carefully Gibson develops every scene and the part of the movie. The time passed so quickly that I haven't even noticed that it came to the end. Well done Mel! Congratulations again!",10,5,11,24 November 2016
