The New World," Malick's finest
","Including even Pocket Money, Malick's films are all about how much nicer it is to live out of town, beyond the mundane cotton mill of everyday life, while noting some of the potential challenges and costs of doing so, in regard to love, place in society, and life expectancy. This film, no different, is vast and incredible, riveting despite an appearance of slowness. Subtle storytelling that furthers innocence and sweetness. Honest as to the ways in which people get involved with one another and begin acting on each others' behalves. Heart breaking, familiar, important. Perfectly cast. Colin Farrell's puckish public persona adds a layer of perceived (or real?) emotional immaturity to John Smith's character that explains, utterly, his priorities. The script is spare and perfect, delivering efficient dialogue and voice-overs that explain those things that always go undiscussed. Q'Orianka Kilcher is like the sun.",10,5,11,1 February 2006
