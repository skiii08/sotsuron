Despicable Me 2," Disappointed but entertained
","I came into this film with great (but realistic) expectations, 'cause it is after all a sequel. Still this film hit just below the bar I had raised.First of all, the plot was not as creative and original as the first. Second of all, neither was the dialogue/script. They both lacked depth, proficiency and pioneering. They really had something amazing to build on from the first film and I don't feel that they seized that opportunity.The jokes weren't as funny, the characters weren't as well written. They just took all the good stuff from the first and added some cheap new characters to complete the cheap plot. And when I say cheap, I just mean they took an easy way out on this one.And what disappointed me the most was that the emotional depth that blew me away in the first, was gone. All that misery and evil that really made the characters who they were and really made you feel with them, it was just gone.But it did contain a great amount of laughter. So in the end, you did receive a very entertaining film for the entire family (mostly children on this one), but don't go into this one expecting the copious amount of emotions that you got from the first film. It was the typical automatic sequel.",6,0,0,30 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Something is very, very off about this
","It's in many ways a very good piece of film and art. But in context of real life the movie really misses its mark. It's clearly supposed to tell the ultimate cocaine repleted American tale that turns into a nightmare. It does a good job on the first part. It never shows us the nightmare.A large portion of the audience will come out of this movie with a new hero and role model. I'm talking about the villain Jordan Belfort. The guy who swindled thousands of people and came off easy because he ratted on his friends.
But the tone of the first portion of the story is far too positive. So positive that it becomes offensive. And the second part, well there's barely any negativity. The tone barely drops. It's all just a humoristic capitalist adventure with a bunch of happy bros living the dream with their drugs and hookers. And while Scorsese tries to salvage it all by putting on a nice vague little bowtie of critique towards capitalism at the end, it's too little and too late. The damage is done. This film has already inspired an entire new generation of misogynistic capitalist pigs.",5,1,2,10 August 2019
