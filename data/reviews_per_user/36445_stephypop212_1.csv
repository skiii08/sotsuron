The Perks of Being a Wallflower," It's a must see movie!!!
","As someone who read the book and was hesitant to see how the movie would come out, I am extremely pleased with the Stephen Chbosky film; The Perks of being a Wallflower.Some parts of the book that would've been great to see in the movie were skipped and that is a shame but all in all the film was definitely a great watch either way. The themes of mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs and alcohol are covered as they are in the book and show a darker side to the characters very well.The casting of the film was done exceptionally well with Ezra Miller and Logan Lerman in particular, who do an amazing job at capturing their characters. Charlies emotions and expressions are exactly how you would picture them to be and Ezra Miller does a great job at being heartfelt yet hilarious through his portrayal of Patrick.",10,1,2,11 December 2012
