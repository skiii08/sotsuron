The Blair Witch Project," Overrated but not bad
","I expected to be disappointed in the Blair Witch Project because there was no way any film could live up to the hype this project has received.  I saw it last night and was pleasantly surprised. No, this isn't the greatest horror film ever made but it wasn't terrible. MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD While the actual night attacks weren't so much scary as just confusing, the finale in the shack was truly nerve-wracking.  The house itself was a brilliant example of shooting in the exact right location.  The acting was okay but the improvised nature of the performances had definite drawbacks -- for instance, the two guys tended to switch personalities from scene to scene.  While it was obvious that Heather was 'acting', it actually worked as evidence of her character's desire for everything to be a movie.  The story behind the film is more interesting than the film itself but on the whole, the Blair Witch Project is neither the disaster nor the masterpiece that everyone else seems to be making it out to be.  I doubt that directors will ever do anything else of note but they have nothing to be ashamed of with this project. As for the most frightening movie ever made (or at least the most frightening that I've ever seen), I'd have to go with the Shining.  Its the only horror film I've ever seen where just thinking about some of the images can still make me jumpy.",Null,1,1,5 September 1999
