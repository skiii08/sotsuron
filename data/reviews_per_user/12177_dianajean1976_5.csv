",I love it when movies make your hair stand on end. It's not an easy thing for any writer / filmmaker to achieve. This film smashed it out the park. 'click',5,0,2,19 April 2019
Captain Marvel," What the hell did I just watch - a student film with a 100 million budget?

Aquaman," Awful Overstuffed Hollywood Cr*p
","10/10 seriously?The Atlantis guards are Power Rangers, the underwater fighter jets are from Star Wars, the battle with other underwater kingdoms looks like a battle from the Lord of the Rings, some personages are a version of the Street Sharks, even Godzila had a resurrection moment!. Do you remember the Disney's the Sword in the Stone? even the guy name is Arthur! Did you spotted the dinosaurs at Jurasic Park? I only missed a Smeagol-like scene with the trident... my prrrrecioussss.Ah, and a very funny scene is watching Aquaman trying not to fall (and looking very scared) from the roof of one house in Sicily (two stories high) , when he'd just jumped from a plane thousand meters high with no parachute in the desert.But Nicole Kidman was beautiful as always.",1,3,4,9 May 2019
The King," Best Movie on Netflix
