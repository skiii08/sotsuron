Insidious: Chapter 2," Dang, they got a lot of g-g-g-ghosts in this movie
","I have seen the movie, you can't say otherwise, that said, I was not paying attention, so what happened? Is there like a ghost of a serial killer? What does he do? Who is the lady ghost? The family in this movie sure has a hard time with ghosts,huh? Do they ever say why that is? Now why don't the people just call the Ghostbusters? My favorite Ghostbuster is Dr. Peter Venkman. Did you know they made a cartoon about the Ghostbusters? They had to change the name because there was already a cartoon with the name Ghostbusters, so they had to call themselves, The REAL Ghostbusters. By finishing this sentence I will have met the minimum requirement for a review.",2,6,9,27 July 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," w.t.f.
","To be fair almost all of Kill Bill 2 is a great movie, the only flaw is the ending, but oh what a flaw. The ending of Kill Bill 2 is equivalent to hiring the two greatest chefs alive putting them in fully stocked fully equipped kitchen with many fabulous ingredients to then pit these two master chefs against each other in some ultimate cook-off challenge, only to be settled by the two chefs calling take-out. Why build tension for a combat showdown climax of your movie if you then have your protagonist and antagonist talk it out? Maybe it's just me, maybe I'm the uncouth clod who thinks that when two opposing kung fu masters meet up at the end of a movie so as to settle an old score that those fighters should fight. I mean do you want to watch a porno where the big stud and the hot bimbo just talk things over and decide to just be friends? I do not understand.",6,0,2,10 July 2013
Men in Black 3," I Am Not A Licensed Psychiatrist
","Specifically this movie is crap, and I as the reviewer should not try to link it to the human condition (insane, we are all insane). If I center my review solely to the movie, I'll be less likely to go off on a tangent. This movie and this movie alone fails for it's own personal reasons, the way other movies fail is irrelevant to Men In Black 3's way of failing. For instance this movie chose substandard writing and plot to try to make it successful. Also egomania is an actual disease, narcissism is a mental disorder, now when I watch Will Smith movies all I see is someone who is very probably mentally ill. It's weird for me. I think, shouldn't someone help him he's obviously sick, but Will Smith is a Hollywood superstar, he's made a fortune being sick. He does not want to get help. Can I say I'm any better?",1,3,7,29 August 2014
Scarface," Summary needs a title
","Sad, flaccid machismo. Supposed to be gritty sexy stylish action/drama, Scarface is not any of those things. Scarface is better than, The Truth About Cats And Dogs, or Almost Famous, and countless other sh*tty movies, but that's like saying a sandwich made of spoiled meat is better to eat than a sandwich made of feces, I mean yeah, spoiled meat sandwich is the way to go if your other option is feces sandwich, but it's not that much better of an option. Hi, hello, do you know who Michelle Pfeiffer is? She is a lady but also, I guess, a human being. I know, a human being just like the rest of us, but you'd never know it from this movie cause they only cast her as a love-interest. Some creep thought 'Scarface needs some fine ass p*ssy to bang', then Michelle's agent got a phone call- acting!",3,1,5,4 March 2016
Iron Man 3," Repeater is an awesome Fugazi album and song
","Main focus of writing a review- 1. Don't spoil the movie ( spoiling a movie means telling somebody what happens before they get a chance to see it, I guess that's bad, like somehow people are incapable of figuring out before hand what will occur in the movie, Hollywood a word synonymous with formulaic repetition and you just can't abide somebody spoiling the plot for you even though it's a plot you have already seen in ten other movies ). With that in mind here is the review for Iron Man 3, too many villains and none of them do anything, child actors are awful all humans despise child actors why do we continue to employ them, also where the f*ck is Iron Man? Nobody cares about Tony Stark, that's why the movie is called Iron Man, you have an Iron Man movie without Iron Man in it, sh*t, might as well call it Iron Man 3",3,1,2,22 July 2014
John Wick," 1983 Buick Regal- for sale, some rust, still works- make an offer
","I'm glad so many people like this movie because I figure SOMEBODY has got to like this movie. A little dull. Many skilled actors given sh*t to work with. Lots of action to forget the real world, but so sterile. Like, I've never seen gun violence so repercussion-free in my entire life, just fire a bullet into the air, no problem. I would say my major complaint is that the movie is not exciting- despite a lot of gore and gun violence ( which is good, it works for me ) it all so obviously happens in a slick fake world that there's no sense of danger for any character. If anyone dies it's glamorized and therefore less real, even the double taps to the face, stylized and melodramatic.",3,23,54,6 November 2014
Iron Man 2," Can you help a brother out?
","Employed professional actors. Empty spaces. Howling wind. Too bad I didn't pick a better movie to review, I would have more to say. What's with Mickey Rourke, why is he in the movie? I've seen good Mickey Rourke movies, I've seen great Mickey Rourke movies, but also, I've seen this movie. Sometimes I forget what the plot is to Iron Man 2, just seems really vague, like there was a NASCAR thing at one point and some guy has I guess electric whips. Later, I remember the plot of Iron Man 2, some guy is mad at him, right? Then he's gotta do something to stop the guy? Does the guy who has the electric whips, like is he a good guy or a bad guy?",3,3,8,6 July 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Ripping off Wrath Of Khan is not the same thing as actually writing
","Not good but not total crap. Here is the debate: You can have Star Trek with more action but a stupider plot or you can have Star Trek that's boring but is in no way stupid. J.J. Abrams chose action over plot, the result is a Star Trek that is fast moving and action packed, but its also a Star Trek that is stupid. Star Trek has always been that guy at the party who is a little boring to talk to but knows what he is talking about, and now J.J Abrams has giving Star Trek a big boost of charisma but at such a high price, sacrificed wit. If you are not a Trek fan or a mild Trek fan you will have no problem with J.J. Abrams style Trek, if on the other hand you like that Star Trek always has to be a bit boring so as to tell a smarter story, then welcome to the new suck.",4,1,4,21 May 2014
Batman Returns," I long for all of them to fall in love with you, but they never do they never do
","A Christmas movie, if that counts for anything. A movie that can be obtained with ease, I mean you can find a copy at a variety of retail establishments-gas stations, Target, Walmart, drug store, grocery store, the mall, even like neighborhood hardware stores can sometimes have a movie bin. Better than even odds within that hardware store movie bin is a copy of Batman Returns. That means whatever you think it should, it's a freebie. This is a movie that could have really benefited from more colors, like for instance anything other than dark blue. Also Tim Burton really mailed it in for this one, just nothing going on, a hollow affair driven more by viewer nostalgia than by merit.",3,3,10,1 November 2014
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," The banality of evil, as a romantic comedy starring Kate Hudson
","It's a movie where the main characters are confident successful people who fall in love with each other. The characters are people who who have NEVER known : alienation, loneliness, injustice, or mental illness. The characters are people who have never been called a weirdo, fatty, ugly, nerd, queer. Who is this movie for? Who are the awful flawless well- adjusted people this movie was made for? There is nothing wrong with shallow people who have never examined their lives to find one another and have a perfect shallow unexamined romantic relationship--that said, who f*cking cares about people like that? That's like the Yankees playing the Cardinals in the World's Series, who f*cking cares?",3,0,1,15 October 2015
Alexander," History is about lying
","Not historically accurate. Also very dull. Hey, let's do what no historian has done yet, let's actually make an accurate movie about Alexander The Great : vain, cruel conqueror, unimportant meaningless life. What did he do? Realistically what could this guy have possibly been like? Think it through, a megalomaniac with an army. Is that what makes for greatness? That doesn't sound horrifying to you? He was not the first westerner to go to India, this idea that he was venturing into uncharted lands is a fable. Do the real story of Alexander, self- aggrandizing murderer rides around on a pretty horse while liars and apologists disseminate pro-Alexander propaganda. Try not to notice all the piles of human corpses.",2,0,0,1 December 2015
Constantine," why?
","A. Why is Shia LaBeouf in this movie? Do you owe him money? Does he have a picture of you getting it on with a ten year old? Did he promise you sexual favors for the role? Could you not find another coked-out boy- band reject, in L.A.? B. Why was this movie so watered down? Has the lowest common denominator proved to be a loyal and reliable audience in the past? Was the concern that if the movie was made well no one would go and see it? Did you not know that movies are allowed to be good? C. Did you know that there is a comic book series called Hellblazer, that's all about John Constantine? Was it too difficult to just use the comic as the movie's story-board? Did you just not want to pay the comic book writers for the screenplay? D. Did you not know that computer generated images look fake? Did you not know that by using lighting, puppets,make-up artistry and blood packs you can make special effects look real? You spent one hundred million dollars to make this movie, did you know you could have made ten movies for that price?",4,0,3,22 July 2013
Terminator Salvation," Oh yeah, the one I don't remember
","What happens? Here's what I remember: This dude has got to save this younger dude. Something explodes. People are all like ' Ah! I'm on fire!'. There is no nudity. Oh also one of the people in this movie is a robot. One of those Terminators like how the movie is called. Wait, but I think like the robot/man, sorry, The Terminator, like he doesn't know he's a Terminator. And I think, I mean I'm pretty sure, like once he finds out he's a Terminator he's still all, ' I'm a good guy, bro!' its probably a pretty dramatic scene, but I don't quite remember. Bryce Dallas Howard is also in this movie, she's one of those lady actors, they usually play the scenery cause Hollywood is run by dicks.",3,1,5,22 July 2015
Suicide Squad," Making an edgy movie isn't the same as making a GOOD movie, I mean my razor is edgy and its a cheap piece of sh*t
","Not as good as watching someone play Super Mario 3-D World, which is exactly what happened when I watched Suicide Squad. I did not watch all of the movie, but I had someone at work who had watched all of this sh*t movie twice, tell me what happens. I feel like that qualifies me as having seen Suicide Squad. Also Harley Quinn's backstory came off as a little rapey. Like David Ayer could have just written the Harley Quinn character as always subconsciously attracted to the Joker, but instead he wrote it so it reads as though the Joker has Harley gang raped into submission. Why write it that way? How is that better? Oh yeah, directing sucks acting sucks movie was written for sh*t, Suicide Squad officially reviewed.",3,3,5,3 January 2017
Pacific Rim," there is a cool Pavement song called Pacific Trim
","They made this movie and I saw it. There were parts where I was merely floating along, which is to say the movie plays but I did not follow. Just a sleepy lazy days sort of movie, y'know, toss back a few sit on the couch and pass out under the light of the TV displaying Pacific Rim. Boring. A lot of stuff is going on but none of it really matters or makes sense, like the film makers were more wasted making this movie than I was watching it, man, so much stuff. Like a word I enjoy using is 'overwrought', it conjures an image of a potter at his wheel ruining vase after vase, so is this movie overwrought. Look, if you love this movie, don't take my review personally, that this movie is made out of sh*t is not your fault, nor your burden.",3,1,1,26 April 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," People are the leading cause of death of people
","The kindest thing I can say about Attack Of The Clones is, George Lucas is an adult male. 1) Do I owe C.G.I. money? Am I legally obligated to say how great C.G.I. graphics look? It looks animated. It looks fake. I'm not impressed by this crap. 2) Why do people write? If it doesn't matter what people say, why bother to write down things to say? 3) Why do people act? Is the point of acting to artistically portray human emotions and human life? If that's the case, does George Lucas know? When I watch Episode II: Send In The Clones, I feel as though George Lucas is unfamiliar with the purposes of Writing and Acting. Movies are not supposed to smell like old ham sandwiches.",3,0,6,1 April 2015
Forrest Gump," Gerp
","This is the kind of movie they make you watch when your in high school. Like close to the end of the school year and the teachers are looking to kill some time, so whip out the school TV and DVD player press play and disappear for two hours. Forrest Gump reminds me how far American public schools have fallen, surely those hypothetical teachers could have found a better movie to show. Look hard through the school library's pile of DVD's, there has got to be something better than Forrest Gump, wait what was that, Barbarella? Yeah you can show fifteen year-olds Barbarella, it only has tittie at the beginning Romeo And Juliet has more nudity, fine, not Barbarella, what about that Charlie's Angels 2, well of course its garbage but its watchable....",3,0,3,7 February 2014
Grease," Everything is fine
","Fine, Grease is great and it doesn't suck. It's great that Rydell High is apparently an all white high school, I'm sure it's all above board. I think its fantastic that Danny treats Sandy like garbage and she's ultimately OK with it. I'm like 'hey, its awesome ' that the movie Grease elevates super mediocre sexual morality, double standards are beneficial . Every time I hear a song from Grease I'm filled with positive emotions and not hatred or darkness. See, IMDb, I'm supportive of Grease and in no way is my review negative, I'm participating, I'm like ' hell yeah ' let's celebrate this movie that isn't horrible or soul crushing, see, I'm being good.",3,0,0,20 June 2020
Armageddon," I don't want to miss a thing- or wait, maybe I do, yeah, maybe I do want to miss a thing
","I understand that some people actually like this movie, that's not their fault and they should not have to take the blame for this movie, I'd just like to say to all fans of Armageddon, I forgive you. No, the blame belongs to two men, Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay, they are at fault in this accident. The words I need to use to describe this movie are offensive-too offensive in fact and yes I realize how little it says of me, one word for instance rhymes with re-farted, we should all do better than use hurtful words when we know better ones so, what this movie is similar to comes out of your anus. I felt this movie was made by adults who are still mentally in 8th grade. Kind of movie where the viewer ends up rooting for the meteor.",2,3,5,22 April 2014
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," What ever it's called
","Is this the mediocrity we have enshrined? This is a beloved movie, like people saw it and they walked away with the conclusion that T3 was the best of the bunch. It features soul-crushing hollow Schwarzenegger humor, did I do something to deserve that, am I being punished? Relies on special effects because I guess writing is hard? I like how all Terminator movies center around John or Sarah Conner, like there is nobody else who could possibly be involved, every single f*cking movie, John or Sarah Conner. The comic books aren't like that. Yes, there are Terminator comics and yes, they are really good, and by and large none of the comics have much to do with the Conners. Read the comics, skip this piece of sh*t.",2,1,7,2 August 2015

"I, Robot"," A movie about predatory behavior in primates featuring Will Smith
","This movie is not summer fun. I've seen it once and feel that's enough for now. C.G.I. looks fake, it doesn't work, the only reason C.G.I. will be accepted in the future is cause future people will not know any better. I like how instead of making a movie version of the book I, Robot ( y'know, simple sci/fi-melodrama about humanity and machines ), they make some Will Smith action movie. This might have been the first movie where I realized that Will Smith is horrible, just completely obnoxious. Like he's not charismatic, he's just a megalomaniac. I, Robot is a dull action movie meant to showcase Will Smith, like one big sh*tty platform he can stand on and proclaim to the world 'look at me! Look at me!'",2,1,3,25 May 2015
Salt," They have a name for movies like this one, it rhymes with bucking piece of chit
","Man, so forgettable. I've read two reviews of it so far, neither helped. I mean, I saw it in the theater, but like no image or bit of dialog stuck with me. Salt contains no memorable character, there is no sequence in the movie that in any way leaves an impression. 2010, y'know, they had fancy effects in place by then, I don't f*cking know. It's just, Salt, y'know, snore, and like millions of f*cking dollars were spent to make this movie, and it's a dud. Around whose neck should this albatross be hung? Man, what a way to waste cash. Dump tens of millions of dollars into an uninspired action vehicle for Angelina Jolie, y'know, f*ck it, who cares. I wonder if her activism is a form of penance for making movies like Salt.",2,0,5,30 July 2015
Van Helsing," Van Hellyeah!
","It's not a great movie, its not Citizen Kane, yet Van Helsing is very much more watchable than Citizen Kane, no offense intended to Orson Welles. Its a ridiculous movie, as much homage as it's camp, but all the time action scenes dominate- Van Helsing is like a James Bond movie where he fights MGM classic monsters. It relies too heavily on CGI although in comparison to any of the Transformer movies, Van Helsing shows restraint. It's a stupid movie, cartoonish in both character development and plot, but as a whole miraculously works. The secret to what makes Van Helsing so watchable- the movie is of no significant moral or social value. I pray they make a sequel, Van Helsing 2 Dracula's Revenge!",10,5,12,21 April 2014
Ender's Game," Hogwarts in space
","Did not read the book, but I've heard more than a few people talk about it, does that count? The movie was playing when I saw it, for sure, I can't say it was at all in any way good but it definitely wasn't really sh*tty. I mean everyone tried really hard so you gotta give them credit for that- the computer animator people did great work, the actors were out there just working their butts off, got professional film director, got a soundtrack. I don't know, it would have enthralled theater going crowds of ten or fifteen years ago, but now...And I think like the plan is to franchise these movies make like two maybe three more Ender's Games, and more power to them if they can make their money with this stuff. I don't know, how was your day?",4,1,3,6 February 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Don't wear me down corporate sound you can watch the space in town
","Fifty million f*cking dollars! They spent that much money to make this movie, you goddamn awful f*cking people. Why not make a new strain of the flu virus and release it ? Why not create some insidious genetic super monster, I mean if we are wasting money on making things that completely suck, then let's make like the all time grand champion of suck ? I feel like this movie was written by a dice game-like each plot point is assigned a number, then the producers just rolled the dice over and over until the screenplay was done, that or it was written by MTV Studios' script-writing android Voxpopulous The Destroyer. All hail the mighty Voxpopulous, may he be merciful! Amen.",2,2,7,14 April 2014
Face_Off," Man, can I just say that the Velvet Underground is such an awesome rock group, also this movie gets reviewed
","Well, it's not terrible. I mean I can get f*cked up and watch the sh*t out of it, but like I have zero emotional connection to it. What happens? Oh yeah, that one guy is mad at the other guy, and John Woo has something to do with this? He directed it? Yowza! They are just giving away money in Hollywood. Did you know they built the world and made it insane? I did not know that either, it came to me as a shock. If I'm gonna play Scrabble, this is an ideal movie to play Scrabble to. Get tanked and just lay down some tiles while this big stupid piece of crap plays out, a person could almost live off of that, almost. So much money, and they ended up making this movie with it.",4,0,1,8 August 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," You don't have to eat sh*t, you really really don't have to
","It just keeps going. The Mission Impossible franchise just continues unceasingly like evil, some grand sh*tty absolute that never goes away. This movie seemed like it could go on forever, like it was one action sequence or chase scene after another connected by nothing other than reoccurring characters. I know it's supposed to be a summer movie and it's not supposed to mean anything, but why abide that mentality? Why do we let ourselves be fed the heaping piles of sh*t that we call ' summer block-busters '? Do you not eat enough sh*t in your daily life that you gotta fill up at the movies too? Just a steady diet of heaping piles of sh*t and we're waiting in line for more?",2,12,27,11 September 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man," No summary needed
","I didn't know this, but I guess just within the past few years an amazing new tool for making movies has come to the forefront, computer generated images. Some guy back in an office dicks around on a keyboard for days on end and never has to be at the actual set to make a movie- isn't that mind-blowing? Think about it, no need to use film, no need to use lighting or make-up or costumes, no need for actors, no need for writers or directors- just get a team of programmers together and let them cobble together a digital file. The future of film making, point and click. Does that in any way ring hollow to you? Does some sh*tty future of lazy drone programmer film makers bother you at all? When did doing something for real become second rate to a virtual experience? What did you get for what you gave up? The Amazing Spiderman 2? How did that work out for you?",3,2,4,25 July 2014

Or if you are into one dimensional plot, this movie's plot is entirely one dimensional. Come on man, it's just a car movie, they make drugs they make rock 'n' roll music the world is full of beautiful people, you can't expect me to give a f*ck about cars anymore. Who cares? F*cking cars? I guess it's entertaining? I saw it in the theater? 2001 was a long time ago?

Die Hard 2," The world is made of all the things that have happened there.

Just shooting people and then catch-phrases, Bruce Willis mugs for the camera. People shout at each other throughout the movie and every four seconds a character says 'McClane'. If you try to turn this into a drinking game, by taking a drink whenever some one says 'McClane',let me warn you now, it will cause alcohol poisoning! Die Hard 2 has no plot, it's like the the word 'airport' was hastily scrawled across a bar napkin and then it served as the script during the majority of filming.

I'm watching it here for the 2nd time and I remember none of it, so I guess the first time I saw it in the theater I had to piss a lot or I was wasted, flying, cause little of the movie was familiar.

The Lost World: Jurassic Park," For Sale: one Special Edition Collectors pack VHS copy of The Lost World, Jurassic Park--listed price $ 1.00
","Manages to be preachy while still able to sell action-figures, video games, fast-food tie-ins, and children's wear. The analogy would be a bible quoting grandmother who also runs a child sex slave ring. This movie feels like it was made as an afterthought to the Universal Studios theme park ride of the same name. This movie features legitimately talented actors: Julianne Moore, Jeff Goldblum, and Pete Postlethwaite stand out in the credits, but their abilities are sorely wasted on one clichéd action sequence after another. Spielberg is given director credit but obviously his personal assistant directed this movie via the telephone from her office in L.A.--that or Steven Spielberg really lost touch by 1997.",3,3,11,7 May 2014
2012," With my body I travel through space
","With a hundred million f*cking dollars why is it hard to make a good movie? How is that difficult? It took more effort to make this movie a total piece of sh*t than had they made the movie good. Point by point from this movie's conception to the final stage of it's being, it's just bad ideas strung together. Who knew you could consistently link up bad ideas and have anything come of it? Usually a series of bad ideas ends in nullification or death, but not 2012, somehow it goes on. That is impressive. Zero plot multiplied by zero dialog divided by zero acting equals what? How many women were manipulated and deceived just so the producers of this movie could have sex with them? 2012?",1,1,3,30 August 2014

Will Smith has to have one of the best agents in Hollywood, if not the best agent, just outright the best. Movie after movie role, he always plays Will Smith, there has never been any variance, and he still gets work. Will Smith is still a box office draw, like people are all ' Oh, Will Smith is in it.', like that's a good thing, like they are now going to see Hancock, or I Robot, or Men In Black One through Three, or Hitch, or the one with his son where they're on an alien planet?

Coyote Ugly," And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
","Horrible in that it promises and promotes itself as some lurid vivacious film about sexy lady bartenders yet delivers PG-13 wholesome goodness. Perhaps the problem is a sensible script is reduced to a movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The name alone is synonymous with everything wrong with modern cinema: movies that sell sex rather than show it, movies that at best can only parody actual human life, movies that seem manufactured rather than made...it sucks. Maybe for you this is a great movie and you had fun seeing it, that makes you lucky in my book, but me, I had the misfortune to see this movie, not a high point in my day, in fact I watch it now and again just to try to take back from this crap movie whatever it took from me the first time I saw it.

Sometimes the white people shout because things happen to them that makes them angry. I heard robot-computers used numbers to show me amazing special effects, what wonders the future has to offer! One thing I don't understand about this movie is why did all that stuff happen. Maybe they will make more spider people movies to explain. Also am I supposed to feel sad when the nice lady dies?

Transformers," An entirely positive review for this movie
","Here is my four point plan for understanding this piece of sh*t movie: 1. Some studio actually chose Michael Bay to direct Transformers, like that was their best idea. 2. Shia LeBeouf is the lead. When people tell me Shia LeBeouf is good at acting, I've found that these same persons also don't watch very many movies. Its like if all the food you ever ate had rat feces in it, you might assume that food with rat feces in it is perfectly acceptable, but you would be wrong. 3. The humor of this movie is like that of a wealthy rapist,who by virtue of his vast wealth is able to evade any and all legal repercussions for his many rapes. 4. Its a movie about a cartoon series about talking cars that transform into robot-men from outer space. The cartoon existed solely to sell toys. It was an absurd show kept relevant by nostalgia alone. So when Transformers is turned into a live action movie its not filmed as an absurd satire, but rather as a serious action movie. A sad self-important bore featuring a dead-eyed Megan Fox, way to go everybody!",1,2,5,26 March 2014
Men in Black II," With flu season here, be sure to wash your hands more often!
","Not as good as Men In Black, not as bad as Men In Black 3. The lonely life of a middle child. A lot of effort was put forth to create mediocrity, an estimated 140,000,000 dollars all to fuel bland aspirations. People sacrificed great amounts of their time and energy for the sake of movie magic to be repaid with a broken vase that has been duct taped back together. To the villains responsible for Men In Black 2- I want my money back. I don't know who I have to write to or e-mail so as to get reimbursed, but believe it, I will find that person. I'm gonna say to that person, ' I know Will Smith seemed like a good idea at the time, but now the guy kinda creeps me out, stop casting him in movies.'",3,1,1,29 October 2014
Empire Records," visual equivalent of a flesh-eating bacteria
","Why do movie studios hate you? A question you might ask yourself after and more than likely during a viewing of this bag of turds, Empire Records. This movie was made so as to justify the drilling of a peephole into Liv Tyler's dressing room. Added to that a malicious automated soundtrack of synthetic music-substitute. A committee of marketing executives and corporate lawyers fabricated a script using the latest in writing based computational programs. This script was not written, no ink touched flesh nor flesh touched paper, no intimacy, a program is initiated in the Script-motron 500 and in mere minutes Empire Records screenplay was drafted. If after the apocalypse this movie is all that remains of the human race then we will have deserved to burn.",2,2,8,10 July 2013
Jerry Maguire," Stuff has meaning but I don't know what it is
","Man, when I saw this movie I was so upset, because that was time in my life I lost to this piece of sh*t movie. They don't make more time, you only got the little and then it's all gone, that was time Jerry f*cking Maguire STOLE from me. Then, as in just a minute ago I read somebody else's review of this movie and they f*cking loved it, they thought this is a movie full of all that I found to be empty. How does this happen? Didn't they see Jerry Maguire? And, yes, they did see it cause they wrote a review about seeing it and loving Jerry Maguire. Amazing. Does any of this make sense to you because I am clueless? Why does anything happen, y'know? If people love Jerry Maguire, I mean what's next what's the next logical step downward?",2,1,5,20 February 2015
Jurassic World," And a fog comes out of the sewers and glows in the dark
","Poor old Bryce Dallas Howard, her hair gets to do more acting in this movie than she does. Severe and straight in the beginning ,softer and curly towards the end after she got some of that sweet sweet character development. Also the Imperious Rex is stupid also everything else in the movie is stupid. I realize that Jurassic Park World is a movie that can be bought and sold, people will go and see it, but people also go out and see new movies original movies. Why not just roll the dice and make a new movie? I mean you got like over a hundred million dollars just to spend on one movie, why not class it up and do something new,y'know, like make one of those movies where the script is well written and the actors get to do their job? Also Jurassic World features a lot of running which is good cause cardio health is super important. Movie reviewed.",2,4,9,14 May 2016
Black Snake Moan," God willing I'll never have to watch this movie again
","Suuuuuuuuuuuucked. Do you have a friend, perhaps an otherwise cool person who likes to watch 'important' movies. I have such a friend, bless his heart, and in his company I had to watch this whole f*cking movie. Holy goats dude did you know the camera was on? Why why why this script? This? This is the story you want to tell Mr. Writer/director of Black Snake Moan? Do you just hate people? Are you here to ruin a movie going experience? I felt like I was being punished, what did I do to you Mr. Writer/director of Black Snake Moan? They make cool movies, you could make a cool movie Mr. Writer/director. I mean, if you think about it, when this script was pitched, some one eventually said 'yes', crazy.",1,2,13,5 February 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Time to take a two hour nap, or Avengers 2
","Its boring. Joss Whedon is a talented writer and director, but he did a bad job on the first Avengers movie, and with this one he managed to do worse. All the characters are flat, nothing happens inside of the characters's heads, zero thoughts or emotions, its obvious that it's just actors giving a performance. The story is inconsequential, plot points appear without meaning or impact, they have to kill a character off just to create drama. Its a formulaic movie that really only works for 8 to 10 year old kids-- On a side note I find it amusing that most of the fans of this and other superhero movies, have not read the comics and probably never will.",2,10,25,4 June 2015
Avatar," What I say about this movie is NOT your fault
","Boring. Amazing amounts of money spent to make this movie. Even more amazing amounts of money spent to see it. For the vast fortune spent on C.G.I. nothing shown is real. It's all fake cartoon visuals meant to distract the viewer from the lack of original plot. Twenty five minutes of viewing is all that is required to know the movie's entire story arc. I know this movie isn't about being great, its meant to showcase the technology of film-watching and the justification to someday charge $20 for a movie ticket. I understand that in our sh*tty economy we will someday have to pay $20 for a movie ticket all I ask is for my money's worth.",2,1,6,9 December 2014
Limitless," Monsters run the world, get ready to eat sh*t for the rest of your life
","It was watched by me. Pointless futility. I imagine Hollywood to be a place were I can score heroin, meth, cocaine, MDA, horse tranquilizers, LSD, wax,or any other drug very easily. Basically if there is a chemical I could become dependent upon, I feel extremely confident about finding someone in Hollywood who can help me score. I feel like if I'm ever in Hollywood and I want to purchase the skill set of a $1,000 an hour hooker, I will succeed. I know, and like the whole scene is famous for making people famous, just go to Hollywood and you can be a big star. Predatory behavior in human beings has created the ' dream-factory ' that we call the motion picture industry. Think about that, because some rapist needs power over others, we can enjoy movies!",2,1,3,18 September 2015
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," so this one is different from the third one?
","Have I seen this movie? Or did I see the third one? Maybe I saw both movies but in my mind I guess those memories are stored in the same place cause I cannot differentiate between Transformers 2 and Transformers 3, I mean both movies are garbage- once again Shia LeBeouf gets acting work, y'know, which is utterly baffling, Josh Duhamel has the emotional range of broken dinner plate, and Michael Bay is allowed to direct a movie. They have real directors working in Hollywood, why did the producers of Transformers go with Bay? Was nobody else home that day when the producers called except Bay? Could the hiring of Michael Bay be seen as some sort of crime? I mean, its has to be fraudulent or at least false- advertising to claim that his movies are entertainment. Oh well, its only your life.",1,2,9,7 September 2013

The Wolf of Wall Street," Every species goes exitnct
","I guess if you had never met anyone like that, the characters in this movie might shock and surprise you. I guess if you didn't already know that sh*tty soulless sociopaths run the world this movie might be edgy for you. Ignorance is bliss. Martin Scorsese is a master film maker. Over time we have seen that he has a fascination with the American experience, specifically with the lives of Americans who make their fortunes outside of the law. I get it. Martin is doing just fine. The Wolf Of Wall Street is well directed well acted well written and worthy of whatever praise and accolades it can gather. My only complaint is that sociopaths are sh*tty boring people and their stories are unworthy of glory. Empathy kicks ass! Mr. Scorsese make a movie of that.",4,4,7,18 December 2014
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Turn the tears that you cry into diamonds- Dracula!!
","Not close to the book, despite all claims otherwise. Falls apart in the third act. The pacing went from first gear to fifth, and the third act goes racing off to the climax. Yes it's very entertaining, I give the film credit for that, but part of the entertainment is the nudity and it's all in the first act. My main problem with the movie is the love story- specifically that Mina forgives Dracula for murdering Lucy, forgives him for ruining Lucy's marriage , and forgives him for turning Lucy into an unholy bloodsucking monster.If that's supposed to be some great love, it just seems to me as really sh*tty , or at least from my perspective.",5,7,11,24 August 2014
Halloween," Over-hyped, yeah, that's right, I said it, way way way over-hyped
","Oh man if words was coin and I could amass them, the riches I could reap from so many people talking talking talking about this movie. ' Jesse you seen Halloween? Its like super scary ' blah blah blah. The most interesting scene- first few minutes of the film when Jamie Lee Curtis and her gal pal are driving around getting blazed, its real, people actually do that sort of thing and the scene was shot in this world not at a studio. Look if this is your favorite horror movie I don't want to take that away from you, I guess my point is this movie is small in stature when I place it next to like The Shining or The Exorcist or The Other. The horror of this movie and the evil it purports to show is small. What was it that T.S. Elliot said? I will show you fear and a handful of dust- make that horror movie, make those words into actors and stage, then come back and talk to me about Halloween.",4,2,4,4 February 2014
Vanilla Sky," Its up to you to decide if you want to waste this much time, I can't tell you what to do
","Boring self-indulgent. Forgettable, leaving this viewer with no clear memory of what happens in the movie or why it happened. Perhaps this movie is better as a screenplay or perhaps it's better in the incarnation of the original Spanish film, regardless, this version sucks. I saw Vanilla Sky in the theater and I can remember thinking 'when does this f*cking thing end?'. I was glad to get up and use the restroom, not at all concerned about missing any plot points. Y'know, the camera is in focus, it's obvious that serious money was put up to make it, the actors are skilled enough, but wow, what a f*cking snooze. A whole lot of nothing for 2 hours maybe more. Hours of your life that you can never recover once spent.",2,2,5,28 July 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Boring-man vs Stuporman: dawn of who gives a crap
","I want my money back. All of it. I will take a check, or Bit-coin or stamps or cigarettes or in some other form of currency, but absolutely, I want my money back. Jesse Eisenberg should be fired from acting or Zack Snyder should be fired from directing or you could fire both of them, I can live with that. Way too serious for an all white cast forced to play cartoon superheroes, levity would have helped were the writers capable of crafting jokes. This movie desperately wanted to compete with the Avengers movies and failed and for the record the Avengers movies were very mediocre, very very very mediocre, a low water mark. Let artists make art, you chumps should stick to whatever it is chumps are good at doing, I don't know what chumps are good at.",1,4,8,1 April 2017
Blade Runner," The question isn't whether he's a replicant or not, the question is do they get away in the end
","Wow, this movie is over thirty years old and nobody,NOBODY, has figured out how to do better. Thirty f*cking years of Sci/Fi movies since and...nothing. No CGI, a lot of shadows, beautiful sets and matte paintings, actors, great script great director, lay all the pieces out on a table and they seem like they should be easily assembled into something wonderful- but no, no one else for thirty years, think about it, Empire Strikes Back came out before it, and Aliens is awesome but not a masterpiece, Aliens is not Blade Runner. What's the problem? How hard is it? Get good actors not just pretty faces, get a director who wants to show a story not some one trying to sell something, get a good script-- Blade Runner, you kick ass. Thank you for being made.",10,1,6,20 July 2014
Identity," Piece of chit
","The plot is made of twists, that way writing, thought, beauty, and meaning don't get in the way to muddy it up. All actors at all times must shout dialog-all actors at all times must kick, or yank, or wrench, or jerk any prop that their character touches. Like just holding a prop or simply opening a door, not good enough. This movie features zero subtle performances- understatement and naturalistic behavior is thrown out in favor of amazing over-acting. Also, good thing it's raining otherwise I wouldn't be able to tell that this movie is a dramatic thriller. Holy f*cking sh*t. The movie has a surprise ending, and here it is: You made a mistake when you saw this movie",1,2,6,18 January 2015
Final Destination," wait, what now?
","This movie is really confusing, I mean Death is the villain stalking the characters, but how can you make Death a bad guy? No, I know what the movie tries to accomplish, I understand the film makers try to personify Death in the scenes where characters are killed off, but it don't work, it looks stupid. I bought a VHS copy of this movie for one dollar, you could tell the scene the previous owner really liked by how worn the tape spool is, its the scene where somebody gets creamed by a bus, that's what these Final Destination movies are really about, gruesome death scenes. ATTENTION ALL HUMANS: Horror is the master genre, it is capable of seamlessly combining all other genres ( comedy,tragedy,sci- fi,historical,etc.etc.)- When you make cheap, ill-conceived, franchise driven gore porn, you make the entire human race look foolish. In regards to the ugly premise of the Final Destination movies, I paraphrase the great sage and eminent junky William S. Burroughs- We face death each day and for that time we are immortal.",1,0,3,22 July 2013
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Yes, absolutely, I could do better!
","I have seen the golden hour's light bathe shoppers in a grocery store, what wealth and given so freely, seemingly without consciousness. This movie is a piece of sh*t, just like all the other ones. If you can love these movies then by all means do so, just don't do it around me if you please. No, for me, I like my horror movies to be great, y'know, like worth seeing. The fans of this movie and its ilk are lucky lucky people. This movie and its franchised-horror-movie kin are able to give to them something that I can never have. Whatever it is this movie gives me, it cannot match the time I lose seeing it. It is an unequal exchange and I want back whatever it is that I have lost.",1,3,17,28 September 2014
Godzilla," Why them people gotta talk through this movie?
","Made the movie then wrote the script, only later realized they did everything backwards. Instead of lots of monster fighting scenes there's lots of scenes of humans acting and delivering dialog, cause that's what people who go see a Godzilla movie want to see. When the monsters do fight and no actor is delivering worthless dialog, its either at night or in a dust storm, thus insuring that ninety percent of the fight is obscured. It's like the people who made this Godzilla did not understand the core concept of a Godzilla movie- it's supposed to be all about giant monsters that fight, watch any Godzilla movie other than the two American ones, it's all giant fighting monsters.",2,4,8,17 February 2015
Casino," At least the desert outside of town is pretty
","Hello IMDb, let's review this movie! Casinos, starring two men and a lady. Mobsters are boring. Their stunted little lives of cruelty, machismo, violence, and crime are meaningless. It's just not entertaining anymore. The town of Las Vegas sucks. It's not cool there, it's a bunch of sh*tty casinos all on one street. Why is that glamorous? How are you impressed by one street with a bunch of casinos on it? No, I mean for real, what makes sense to you about Las Vegas? The town is a tyrannical water thief, wasting daily thousands of gallons of precious fresh water so vain idiots can throw away money. Where is the glamor in hubris? What are the luxuries afforded by furious insanity?",3,1,7,13 December 2015
Heat," A review where I say only good things about Heat instead of something mean or hatefull
","I believe Heat must have been the concoction of some childlike-emperor of a movie producer. His vision, the sad delusion of having two of Hollywood's biggest tough guys square off against each other, Pacino versus De Niro, although neither tough guy is over 5'8'. Val Kilmer wears a ridiculous wig, or maybe its his real hair, which would be much worse. Some fool cast Tom Sizemore to appear in this movie. Heat features talented actresses ( Venora, Judd, Brenneman ) but the movie asks of these ladies to be part of the scenery- I can only assume this is because having good roles for the women in this movie would spoil Heat's chickensh*t macho fantasy. Its like this movie was written by a twelve year old boy, who wrote the the script with burned food rather than ink. Great job Michael Mann.",2,5,14,5 September 2013
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Some people wear glasses because they are prescription
","England is alternate universe America, no further proof than this movie, The Kingspeople. British people dress like Americans they just talk funny and use a class system. This movie is about the British class system and how even poor people are worthy to become pawns in some meaningless struggle between global economies. Also, a lady offers anal-sex as an incentive for her rescue from imprisonment. Cause that's what women so often do, in real life. There are so many other choices to offer than anal sex right off the bat, a hand-job, a blow-job, just regular old vaginal sex, when did vaginal sex become not good enough? Is this a new thing? I mean you are just giving away the keys to the kingdom to like the first dude that comes along, does that sound prudent to you? More entertaining than the following movies: Sleepers, Divine Secrets Of The Ya-Ya Sisterhood, For The Love Of The Game, Chicago...",3,6,15,25 February 2015
Fantastic Four," This is a movie!
","Fine, O.K., this movie, The Fantastic Four, O.K., it was a movie that I saw, I was younger then, when I saw it. Jessica Alba is just like a nice lady and we all force upon her this weird sex symbol thing, I mean she just want's to be an actress and we are all like ' hurry up and get f*cked '. Oh, and hey, thank God for computer generated images otherwise how in the f*ck would we be able to tell stories- what just use a f*cking camera with some actors? Not in America, asshole! Somewhere I've heard this was one of those movies based on comic books. The plot of the movie is outer space is where the good stuff is at and you gotta go there with scientists in order to get it, see, science has a purpose.",4,1,4,17 October 2014
Spectre," Not the best, not the worst, better than Quantum Of Solace, less than Skyfall
","Got a lady who looks like Dianna Rigg, got an Austrian mountain top clinic, just like in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Got a helicopter with Blofeld in it that fights James Bond, just like the beginning of For Your Eyes Only. I don't know, it was predictable and the action scenes were forgettable. Again, as stated in a previous review, this movie is far more entertaining than a Fast And Furious movie, but as James Bond movies go, its blah. The best parts are how M and Moneypenny and Q and that other guy all interact with each other as a team, and if anyone is listening, it should be made a part of the next Bond movie, y'know, show the fact that James Bond has a support team and how vital they are to his success.

Warcraft," Better than playing World of Warcraft cause it only wastes two hours of your life
","Lo verily and forsooth they did doth make a Warcraft movie and zounds did it doth so suck. Huzzah all pieces of this movie were lame and sh*tty, prithee dear reader and I shall reveal the tale of woe of why Warcraft doth choke on knob- Once upon a time people wasted time playing an on-line video game, so much time and money was wasted that to justify the expenditure a movie was green lit by presumably a bunch of rapist producers and studio executives. Their goal? To create a very mediocre way to recoup an investment in The World Of Warcraft and Blizzard Games proprietary rights. Were the movie makers successful? I guess so?",2,1,4,19 October 2017
The Breakfast Club," All the sharks have teeth
","When I watch this movie it means nothing to me. It has never meant anything to me, and I have never chosen to watch this movie. Each situation in which I have watched the Breakfast Club, it was never my decision and I was not allowed to leave. Perhaps that might have biased my impression of this movie but nevertheless The Breakfast Club is an oppressive movie. It weighs down upon me, merciless cloying teen angst honky bullsh*t. And the worst part, so many people love this movie! All over America, people love The Breakfast Club, its normal, like somehow I'm the weird one. It's like a goddamn zombie dream but also a popular movie from the 1980's.",2,2,8,24 January 2015

With film I can capture motion and that motion makes you feel. With film I can sell toys and cars and video games and clothes and three-ring binders and bed sheets . With film I can show you Shia LaBeouf coked up out of his mind making a mockery of acting. With film I can show you an unending parade of computer generated images of battling robot-men and ridiculous destruction. With film I can elevate mediocrity and make virtues out of greed and cowardice. We are the ones who we have been waiting for.,1,2,6,4 April 2014
Furious 7," Horses are super awesome!
","A movie seemingly written by a ten year old boy. Everyone plays one dimensional characters that exist solely to drive the cars. I think Tony Jaa got paid more to appear as a nameless villain in this movie than he ever got for any of the Ong Bak movies. Jason Statham plays an evil version of his Transporter character, specifically because the Transporter character drove cars, like that's why he's in this movie cause the ten year old who wrote this movie was like 'who's the toughest car driver to fight the car drivers of Fast and Furious? Oh yeah J. Statham!' It's a stupid car chase movie, there is zero plot zero creativity zero cool, it made a fortune.",2,2,21,5 November 2015
