Resident Evil: Afterlife," I am a true fan of resident evil but
","What happened i was so disappointed the plot was horrible i liked extinction much more because it actually had a good plot and interesting character reactions and not only that it brought back the tyrant. Also im confused why would umbrella keep experminting after what already happened from what they did. Okay it was enjoyable and i like the new characters but seriously this is bad. The other ones i liked a lot more. Not to mention that this copy,s resident evil 5. I knew it that this was gonna happen there was no story what so ever. Okay if they are making another one and if they are gonna explain why umbrella is doing something that doesn,t even make sense i will retract this statement and delete this review until that comes this ain't going nowhere. I only recommend this to people who like action no plot type movies",5,0,1,14 May 2011
127 Hours," Danny boyle always impresses me
","Spoilers alert Thats right danny boyle always manages to pull out some of the most awesome movies with some of the most basic plot lines. Here a guy treks through the canyon aron something little while since i watched it, a few years. But anyway this guy aron was trecking through the canyon and he tries to climb down a narrow pass and then something horrible went wrong. Aron slips on a boulder and he falls with it and ends up getting his arm jammed between a rock and the canyon he was trapped for 5 days and the story displays the accurate description of a trapped rat. He lives off a small supply of water and food for the next few days eventually having to cut his arm off to get out. WATCH WATCH WATCH NOW IF YOU CAN you will not waste your time",10,0,1,23 April 2013

The story line is so creative and nick cage you are redeemed from all the bad movies you star in this is the golden bar out of the pile of crap you have acted in. The plot is so perfectly drawn up that no one would expect it , hell i didn,t even expect it. I thought i would have been stupid after i saw it , i was shell shocked. I mean i thought it would be a stupid ghost movie but I WAS DEFINTLY WRONG. I shall recommend this movie to anyone who likes creative movies.But there was one part that fell flat in fact i take that back nothing fell flat .",10,1,7,10 May 2011

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," This is a star wars movie. FINALLY!!!!!
","WARNING SPOILERS Let me just say that JJ Abrams has outdone himself, he has A lot to live up to, i wasn't expecting the empire strikes back or a new hope. What i wanted was a movie that lived up to the name itself. FINALLY after 32 years of waiting and having to deal with bad prequels and EWWWW Jar Jar Binks, we finally have a movie that we can call star wars. PROS: Acting was superb, finally we rid ourselves of the dry acting of the prequels and gaze upon a already likable duo of characters of Finn and Rey who have great chemistry and character development. The two characters go through so much in such a short amount of time that they develop a great friendship, one the audience will be moved to. You actually believe that kylo ren is a villain, he feels like he is with the dark side, you want him to lose, you want to see his fall. You can feel his hatred coming across the screen, the young apprentice of the dark side will be with you all when you leave that theater i guarantee it. A memorable antagonist and memorable protagonists go hand and hand with a....GREAT PLOT: The plot is superb and well written harking back to the old trilogies for its twists and patience, despite its fast paced in your face story it feels, the movie still finds a way to live up the title the force awakens, slowly you see the character Rey feel the force around her, at first she is afraid she runs only to see the young dark apprentice confront her wanting to find the old sky walker, the last of the Jedi, he takes her back to his death star impersonation to interrogate her, while he is interrogating her with the use of the force, she pushes back, she begins to feel her power growing and uses the force to play a Jedi mind trick on the storm-trooper guarding her. That is actually a flaw i will have to point out, she kinda gets her force powers A LITTLE TOO quickly, only experience Jedi can get or so we have been led to believe. After this( WARNING A BIG SPOILER) hold back your tears, a childhood favorite dies in this one. That is right our beloved Han solo perishes before us, i couldn't believe it myself. A tragic but perfect plot twist to show how far the young apprentice has fallen to the dark side, by killing his own father. He has cemented himself now the most hated villain in the whole franchise next to Darth Vader, he lives up to the name villain. Forever we will know Kylo Ren to be the sole slayer of Han solo forever and all of eternity. The perfect climax which drew us to admittedly a rather weak light-saber battle with some confusing elements, again how does Rey manage beat him, granted he is just an apprentice, but isn't he more experienced in his use of the force and his skill with the light-saber, I,m confused he was trained by Luke Skywalker apparently. He should have beaten with her ease and further cemented himself as the dark villain, but instead the fight sorta in a little way takes away his cloak of darkness. Which maybe does the title well i suppose because these characters are just now becoming one with the force and it would explain why Kylo was just a apprentice not a sith. BACK ON TRACK, the light-saber duel was tense you feel you could cut that tension with a knife, when Kylo and Finn are fighting you can feel the hatred and anger coursing through them same with Rey and Kylo. And then at the end, old Skywalker makes an appearance you can feel by the end with his appearance, the first in decades. That the force has awoken fully living up to its title Cons: There are some confusing elements like the light-saber duel and how kylo ren somehow was dispatched by someone who has never used the force before or even held a light-saber, never had any experience whatsoever was able to dispatch him, again he is just a apprentice perhaps JJ Abrams was trying to make a point that kylo ren was inexperience as well by the supreme leader dude at the end saying i will complete his training does help the situation, but it feels so forced to cover his but there. Well sorry JJ you screwed up here, you managed to capture the tension but not the realism, the forced CGI effect wont save you. Or how about how Finn decided to suddenly leave the first order because he felt it was 'Right', at the very least we were shown his character not joining in on the slaughter on innocent civilians in the village, and him taking off the helmet showing his disbelief and horror on his face, JJ Abrams was able to cover up some of his mistake there but didn't do enough, i feel Finn's character is hiding something that hopefully the other films will explain down the line as to why he suddenly left the unit that he himself as a child trained with his whole life, i just feel it was forced not explained enough. Again this star wars franchise is a lot to live up to its hard to tell everyone's story, but Finn is very important and you kind of messed up the beginning there sorry but no other way to say it. Overall this movie is deserving of the title star wars, JJ Abrams put all he had into making this a great title for people to love, the fans of the old and the fans of the new will enjoy this title that we have been waiting for so long. Go see it, it was worth my money and dare i say every penny.",8,2,14,17 December 2015
The Martian," One of the best Sci Fi films made( Don't listen to the haters)
","First let me start off by saying that this movie isn't going to have a masterpiece plot with development between the characters and yeah there are some minor flaws that i will get into. Don't listen to the bad reviews, the characters are fine the way they are. Its a copy paste of Apollo 13 pretty much expect its on mars, it has Matt Damon, and there is only one man to save. The movie doesn't pretend to be unique or something its not. The trailer, the title don't give you anything else as to what this is. Its a simple rescue mission to go get Matt Damon off of mars, and we get to see how he survives it. The acting was great, the characters also were great. You could relate to all of them and there struggles of what choice was the right one on getting Mark Watney (Matt Damon) home. Mark Watney is a very likable character that the audience can cheer on and support through the movie.The science is very accurate sure there are a few flaws which i will start with first. The intro was a little confusing, at first i questioned whether or not the storms on mars were that powerful, or whether or not there were any storms at all on real life mars. I did end up finding out that mars does have storms, but the storms wouldn't be able to push watney all the way out onto the landscape like that, nor would it be able to cause the module so much damage that they have to take off and leave without him. Other than that this films adaption of the mars setting and environment, along with what Mr. Watney had to do to survive is very accurate and beautifully portrayed. For example, when Mark Watney figured that he only had enough food for 400 days at most. He figured he had to create his own artificial environment inside the station to farm food and sustain himself until rescue. ' In order to make water you need to combine hydrogen and oxygen and you burn'. That was the only way for him to get enough water to farm his crops, he barely enough water to drink and for sanitation to begin with, so that was the only method he could use. As we all know inside the station, its basically pure oxygen so he had to be careful to only use small sparks to create it. When he was successful at doing this he then had his moment of triumph and cheered right in front of artificial water maker adding extra oxygen to from his own breath caused an explosion. The travel time between earth and mars is very realistic as well, during the movie you can just feel time passing by and watney doing his daily chores next to the station or hab and Ares 3 seemingly taking forever to get back to earth. FINALLY it accurately depicts what long term space travel is like, its brutal and long and boring. The gravity isn't accurately depicted, which is forgivable. You cant film all sequences like this underwater or with CGI you need times where film has to be shot, so its forgivable and i will give that a pass. All and all this is a very good movie and you should go watch it when it comes out on DVD on January 16th 2016",9,2,6,29 December 2015
