The Lobster," Painful to watch, but unforgettable for its sheer strangeness
","This was definitely the strangest movie I have seen in a long time, maybe ever.It is not a particular good movie, and will you probably not be able to make much sense of it (I know I was not), but - given you actually manage to sit through it - you will definitely remember it, and probably tell other people about it.Does that make it a good movie? I don't think so. But if you want to see something really strange and different, unlike anything you ever saw before, it might be worth investing the time - even if it runs more than two hours, we never really got the urge to turn it off while watching it, since every time we were in danger to get bored, the movie got even stranger, making us watch in baffled disbelief as the bizarre story unfolded.5/10. Would definitely not watch again, but do not regret watching either.",5,0,1,9 May 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," not really what i expected...
","Reading the short description on IMDb I thought this would be a suspense/psycho thriller. Instead, it comes across as a weird genre mix which ultimately did not really work out for me.Even though all the (three) actors are good, with John Goodman delivering an outstanding performance. Pacing is okay, although sometimes rather slow without really building suspense. What I really disliked the unnatural and forced feeling of the ending, but I guess JJ Abrams does not like to make a movie without aliens...",4,0,0,18 May 2017
The Notebook," Charming, if a little generic and naive romance flick
","The notebook is a charming romance movie that easily transports you back into the 40ies to tell its pretty implausible story of a woman torn between two men.That being said, I do not understand Ryan Gosling's acting at all, especially not in a romance flick.Like in the movie Drive, his character keeps the same constant look of detached, dreamy, slightly silly, perpetual slight amusement on his face all the time - whether he meets the love of his life, or his best friend dies - it doesn't seem to make any difference to him.I simply don't understand whats the point of that. In a romance movie, the actors should try their best to convey believable emotions, not try to hide them at all cost? While in Drive, this sort of acting made some sort of sense within the generally weird framework of that movie, it just seems completely out of place in a romance movie, and is especially noticeable here because of its contrast to the lively, hearty performance of Heather Wahlquist as Sara.In the end, this did not really completely ruin the movie for me, but I still found it distracting and detrimental to the overall charm of an otherwise above-average romance movie.Still, the high rating on IMDb would have irritated me either way, but I guess the tear-jerking end served to push that up.5/10",5,2,3,4 July 2017
The Beach," good cinematography, but shallow, too short, and disappointing ending
","i loved alex garland's novel, and so even though many people warned me that the movie is not as good i decided i had to see it.it starts out fairly good, the opening scenes get you right into it, the actors are well-picked, the music fits well, the scenery is beautifulunfortunately the longer the movie runs the worse it gets. none of the characters on the island get developed at all, there seems to be no time for that. the movie stays pretty shallow, and navigates around the more nasty parts of the book, especially towards the endingthe ending is such a let-down if you know the book. instead of a gradual descent into madness with a thrilling climax it just kinda ends... thats it. none of the Vietnam war stuff, none of the psychological stuff between the inhabitants of the beach... well, i guess to do that boyle would have needed to develop the characters from the start, which he never did. the only character that has even a little depth is sal, its not an easy book to turn into a movie i guess, but a little more depth would have gone a long way in improving this. as it is, it comes off as shallow and superficial as your usual travel acquaintances in thailand...",5,0,0,21 January 2012
Interstellar," The most overrated movie on IMDb right now, a complete letdown
","If you saw 'sunshine' and thought 'wow, good thing they had scientist advisers, this stuff is so plausible', you will like 'interstellar'.If you saw 'armaggeddon' and thought 'what an awesome movie, i just wished they would have dragged the scene where he says goodbye to his daughter out even more', you will like 'interstellar'.If you saw 'inception' and thought 'this movie would be so much better in SPACE!', you will like 'interstellar'.And if you liked '2001' or any other intelligent/geeky sci-fi movie, you will hate 'interstellar'.Like some of Nolan's earlier works, it's long for the sake of length only. Its plot is up there with 'armaggeddon' in pure stupidity and forced US-cowboy-patriot-macho-ism, its special effects are underwhelming, its plot twists are obvious, its setting makes no sense, its characters are flat and forgettable, and its constant citations of '2001' just serve to make you remember how much better Kubrick did all of this with a tiny fraction of the money almost 50 years back.Disappointing.",4,201,442,19 November 2014
The Revenant," great effects and an awesome start but degenerates into a meaningless mess of Hollywood clichés
","I recently came across the story of Glass briefly when reading TC Boyles 'The Harder They Come', and since this book increased my already big fondness for pioneer or realistic wild west settings, I was looking forward eagerly for a new big budget movie that promised to capture the pioneer era atmosphere in a grim survival story.The movie starts out awesome enough, kicking off with a powerful Indians vs Pioneers battle scene that features incredibly long, action-packed shots. Unlike in the original story the movie is based on, Glass brings his half-Indian son along, creating some father/son moments and some tension with the other guys on his trek who are not that fond of savages. Shortly after, we are treated to the high point of the movie - the already famous bear scene, which is masterfully done, and painful to watch for its cruel realism. Unfortunately, from there, it is all downhill.The whole point of the original story, Fitzgerald and Bridger leaving Glass behind, gets watered down by the state Glass is pictured to be in - the way it is shown in the movie, it would have obviously been the only logical thing to do to leave him behind, with the Indians on the trek's tail and his chances of survival being nil. Rather than creating a believable dilemma, the movie goes all over- the-top in Hollywood clichés. Instead of just leaving a maimed Glass behind for dead, Fitzgerald kills Glass'es son, turning a survival story into a revenge thriller. We are shown all kinds of bad aspects of Fitzgerald's character to turn him into 'the bad guy' so we can root for Glass killing him at the end.At the same time, the whole Indian side-story that was courageous enough to show Indians as ruthless attackers and not stick to the 'noble savage' cliché gets watered down with an unbelievable silly twist when it is revealed that the Indians are just searching for the chieftain's kidnapped daughter, which we later find out was kidnapped by those pesky French, who do all kinds of badguy Indian killing stuff (as opposed to our noble pelt hunters, who are righteous decent human beings with the exception of the traitor Fitzgerald).The actual survival story then gets completely out of hand, being so over-the-top as to remind me of action movies like Die Hard 2, that do not claim to be realistic and do not take themselves as serious as this movie. Glass, still in a state where he can only crawl, escapes the Indians by jumping into an ice-cold river, gets thrown down waterfalls, gets on a horse, falls down a cliff of around 100ft, etc etc etc. At this point, the survival story failed to grip me, since it was obviously based on comic book physics and -realism. It gets even more ridiculous, when Glass manages to find the time on his survival ego trip to befriend a lone Indian (who is later killed by the evil, evil French, but not before healing Glass with some Indian sweat lodge magic), and even to rescue the Indian chieftain's daughter who was held prisoner as a rape object by the French, who again thankfully stepped in to fill in for the bad guys.Despite all of this, the movie manages to stay pretty enjoyable (and never boring) until the ending, which was so horribly predictable that it made me cringe. First Glass meets up with the rest of the trek, looking extremely healthy for what he's supposedly been through - DiCaprio could have at least lost some weight for this movie, or otherwise they could have used CGI to make him look thinner. Fitzgerald escapes from the camp, stealing the money from the rest of the crew in the process (that baddie bad guy!). For some reason, even though they still have plenty of other men left, only Glass and the Captain set out as a group of two to hunt Fitzgerald down.When the Captain then tells Glass some sentimental crap about his wife when they sit down at a fire at night, he might have just as well put on a red Star-Trek shirt, because it couldn't have been made any more obvious that he would be shot in the lead-up to the inevitable showdown between Glass and Fitzgerald.Predictably enough, thats exactly what happens. To make matters worse, we are not only treated to the good old 'both antagonists lose their weapons so it degenerates into a fist fight' cliché, but then, as the predictable fight, that tries to make up in cruelty what it lacks in innovation, inevitably ends with our hero Glass beating Fitzgerald and threatening to cut his throat, Fitzgerald tells him in a typical bad-guy way that killing him won't bring back his son, AND SO GLASS REFUSES TO KILL HIM. Are you kidding me? You just ruined the whole point of turning a survival story into a revenge trip, and lost the last bit of credibility the story had until now.But of course we cannot let the bad guy get away, and so the actual killing is done by the Indians, who arrive just in time to finish Fitzgerald off and stare silently at Glass in a menacing silent Indian cliché thing. Since Glass saved his daughter's life, the Indian chieftain refrains from killing Glass, and instead rides off silently without acknowledging or helping the wounded Glass lying on the ground who saved his daughter's life. Makes sense.The movie fades out with a shot of Glass staring into nothing. At least he didn't go after the chieftain's daughter to make some more Indian half-breed babies and live happily forever after.6/10",6,53,70,7 January 2016
The Number 23," starts promising, ends up being completely pointless
","this movie is a good example of a fault a lot of newer movies seem to make. since the audience is getting accustomed to plot twists, most plot twists that make any sense at all will be predicted by people and thus not really surprise them. to get a feeling of how much the ability of people to foresee plot twists has changed, just watch the usual suspects. i think most people nowadays would see the ending coming from a mile away, when back when it came out it apparently surprised most peopleso in order to make a really surprising plot twist, movies just make plot twists that make no sense at all, and are thus impossible to predictthis is the case with the number 23, which starts up nicely by building up suspense and developing its characters and then follows this up with a plot twist that makes absolutely no sense at all based on anything we ve seen so far. i felt pretty let down when after the first two thirds (23!) the whole plot started going down the toilet.the acting also gets pretty bad from there, apparently even the actors didn't know how to deal with the sudden complete change of the characters they are portrayingthe horrible Hollywood ending seals the deal for this mediocre movie, instead of focussing on the good part (showing the decline into paranoia of a normal person) it tries to be too many things at once and ends up being some garbled garbage",4,1,3,16 April 2012
Avatar," forgettable flick, might be state of the art right now effects-wise, but ridiculously weak plot
","i watched this yesterday and i was really disappointed, i cannot see what people see in this movie. the story makes no sense at all, all the characters are really clichéd, and the whole movie is ridiculously predictable.especially the plot element with the marine being in a wheelchair feels really forced, seeing some guy in a wheelchair in a spaceship between walking mecha-robots felt unreal, even more unreal than the sigourney weaver character smoking inside a tech lab 150 years in the future...as for the visuals, they might be the best effects to date, but the world of pandora still doesn't look real. it has a computer-gamish look on it, and since the whole storyline is like something someone wrote down in 10 minutes for a computer game, i couldn't help but feeling like i was watching some game trailer.",4,6,11,27 April 2010
The Fountain," My favorite movie of all time.
","First off, that the first time I saw this, I was slightly disappointed, since I expected something more similar to Aronofsky's first two movies - 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'Pi'. Something raw, something brutal, something in-your-face.The Fountain is more complicated though. After seeing it for the first time, the music and the visuals never completely left me, and i kept watching it. Again and again. By now i saw this movie more often than any other (ten times so far), and it still does not bore me. In fact, I keep discovering new stuff every single time i see it.This is one of these rare works of art where every scene, every dialog, every tiny detail in the background, every note in the score, is of importance for the grand overall picture - and what a picture it is indeed!Life, death, love. The cornerstones that define the human conditions, are what this movie is ultimately about. Most that would have tried to get across the point that 'The Fountain' makes would have failed, but not Aronofsky - he delivers it with unmatched visual perfection, and with the help of outstanding acting from his cast.No movie ever matched the score and the visuals so well. The music is beautiful and haunting at times, and keeps building up momentum, just like the movie does, towards the biggest, most emotional and deepest climax I ever saw in any movie. Be sure to turn the volume up for this one!An extremely powerful movie, and very thought-provoking at that.",10,5,8,19 November 2014
Mother!," Horrible, disappointing, a complete disaster
","Oh Aronofsky, where have you gone wrong?You started out with an amazing debut (Pi), followed an absolutely brilliant movie (Requiem for a Dream), and then put out my favourite movie ever (The Fountain).From there, it was all downward, and now this?What it this movie supposed to be? It starts out awesome, with beautiful cinematography - every little detail's color seems to have been hand-picked with great care, and the scenes come across like paintings, everything is painted in warm, brown hues.The actors are great, and suspense builds up, and then... well then everything slowly and painfully degenerates into a screaming mess that is simply unbearable. I turned down the volume because my significant other wanted to finish this, but there is no way I would NOT have walked out of the theater on this one. There is only so much of people screaming that I can take, especially if it serves no purpose...How long do you need to shove a point down your viewer's throats before it is enough? EVERYONE ALREADY GOT IT (or stopped caring what this is about).I wish this would have been at least half an hour shorter... but that probably wouldn't have been enough to make it a good movie anyways.I don't know what else to say, really, since I want to keep this review spoiler-free... not really like there is much to spoil anyways, but I want to warn everyone who does not read reviews that contain spoilers:DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It's a waste of time and will piss you off.",2,1,1,27 December 2017
Cloud Atlas," in some ways better than the novel, in some ways worse, but a very beautiful adaption
","after recently finishing the novel i decided to give this movie another watch. i watched it in theaters when it came out and liked it a lot, and my opinion of it improved even more with the second watchingwhy this bombed at the box office i cannot understand. special effects, cast and acting are awesome, and while i like long movies in general i have yet to see another movie that seems so short and without any lengths even though being 3 hours long. time just flies by as you watch a mesmerizing whirlwind of character archetypes playing out their roles again and again through different times. compared to the book, the repetition of motives and actions by the same kind of people stands out even more in the movie, thanks to the nice trick of using the same actors for same personalities through all times.the movie heavily changes the plot line in many of the sub-stories, which was a necessity since the novel would have been impossible to make into anything less than 8 hours long otherwise. some of the changes are made out of necessity of shortening and simplifying individual plot lines, some of them actually improve the story by adding even more deja-vues and connections, like Vivian Ayrs the composer living in the same house later used as aurora home for the elderly, instead of living in french- speaking Bruges like in the book. adding another language would have been pushing it too far anyways, since the movie is already demanding with its multitude of dialects spoken throughout different times.some changes seem a bit forced however, such as the oil industry instead of nuclear power being the big evil in the 70s plot line, a change that ended up not making much sense at all, and just served to push an agenda, like the inclusion of global warming in the Neo Seoul plot line. the post-apocalyptic plot line in the far future gets changed the most, and ends up making not much sense at all (why do the Prescients not just fly up the mountain? why do they not use their advanced weaponry to help the valley people fight the Kona? why do they need to send a signal for help to colonies? the whole concept of outer space colonies saving mankind from earth makes little sense scientifically), however i have to say that the book had its logical flaws as well, and these can be overlooked in a work of this scale.one of the main topics of the book, the rise of a corpocracy and the description of the future in Neo-Seoul, was basically dropped from the script in favor of more action, a decision i find understandable since there is not that many chances to have special-effects-laden action scenes in the other plot lines, and which ends up working okay in my opinion.the topic of slavery is even more pronounced than in the book, and although i disliked that the movie chose to simplify here and stereotypically show white people as the enslavers of Atua in the earliest plot line, instead of Maori people like in the book, this can be excused with the necessary streamlining and simplification of all plot lines.all in all, this was a way better movie adaption of a nearly unadaptable book than anyone could hope for. i liked both the movie and the book, they both have their strengths and weaknesses. the book might be overly long at times, while the movie might sometimes be overly simple and not making much sense. but overall it is a masterpiece, and way better than anything anyone could expect from the Wachowskis after they totally botched the matrix sequels.why it gets so much hate is clear as well: it offends a lot of people with its esoteric concepts like re-birth, and maybe even moreso with homosexuality and trans-gender themes. but if you are not a close-minded bigot, and are not annoyed by the constantly switching between plot lines, i see absolutely no reason why you should not love this movie.",10,9,12,15 September 2013
Her," the ultimate hipster movie. visually stunning, intellectually interesting, but unforgivably slow and boring
","This movie has all the ingredients of a classic - good actors, an awesome never-before seen visual style for the near future, interesting dialogue, a clever and kind of novel story...Unfortunately, what absolutely killed this movie for me was that it is way, way too long. This movie has absolutely no business of being more than 1:20. It's length feels forced, it's like the movie is so in love with its own visual style that it cannot help but move from one scene with a nice backdrop to another with a cool time lapse to another back-flash montage etc etc etc. It's like it's moving in circles.But the thing is: it's basically all monologue. The movie's cool backdrops non-withstanding, it could just as well be an audio book. All you do is watch the main character talk talk talk talk, with no other persons on screen most of the time. While the acting is above-average, we could not sit through the whole movie in one go. My girlfriend got really sleepy after what seemed to us like 90 minutes, yet when i checked, only 50 minutes had elapsed. When we finished the movie on the next day, it felt again like two hours.Don't get me wrong - I do not dislike slow movies in general, quite the contrary. But this movie is not only slow, there is just nothing to see on the screen except for a hipster fashion parade of the future. You might as well close your eyes.Its a general tendency nowadays for almost all movies except for cheap popcorn-flicks to run for at least two hours. Even senseless blockbuster action flicks nowadays have no shame running two and a half hours or even three hours, and that length isn't justified by a huge story arc, but only achieved by lots of filler scenes, or - in the case of 'Her' - by repeating its main ingredients over and over and over.At the bottom line, this is what this came down to for me: a movie that is so in love with its own greatness that it is unwilling to let go and just move on. This makes it the ultimate hipster movie, even more than all the moustaches and sci-fi hipster fashion.",4,1,1,22 June 2015
