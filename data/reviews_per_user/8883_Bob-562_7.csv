The Blair Witch Project," Not as frightening as all the hype would have it, this is a fun and clever film nonetheless.
","'The Blair Witch Project' uses its shoestring budget to great advantage: without relying on expensive special effects, it forces the audience to use its imagination in confronting, along with the three filmmakers, the terrors of the unknown.  Hollywood today feels compelled to SHOW everything onscreen, to go for the cheap & easy shock.  This film relies on a well-honed script, very convincing acting (the actors seem 'real'), and taut direction that causes the audience to genuinely feel for, and empathize with, the woebegone filmmakers.  We've all been afraid of the dark, and this film builds its suspense on this premise.  The only downside for me about the film is that it could have left the mystery more ambiguous; i.e., I thought it emphasized too much that the mystery was genuinely supernatural, rather than manufactured (a prank by outsiders that got out of hand).  Other than that, I thought it was quite a good film.  Bravo!",9,0,0,4 August 1999
Armageddon," Unbelievably Bad!
","OMG, this movie wouldn't end! Michael Bay takes an 'epic' approach to purely schlocky crap on the screen. Gee, do we need any more hackneyed stereotypes of Southerners? (Don't worry, I'd rather slit my wrists than live under the Mason-Dixon line!) However, this turd revels in perpetuating stereotypes of 'woiking-class' types from down South that even a Thomas Dixon would object to. Oh, and let's spice things up in the endless lull of drilling into the asteroid by having Paris wiped out. NYC doesn't look like NYC (gee, are there subway stations for 53rd & 58th streets?? A native New Yorker, I didn't know about them!), & of course it doesn't matter what Paris looks like, since it's all conveniently wiped out. Blecch!",2,1,3,3 January 2018
Ocean's Eleven," A Slick & Polished--and Fun--Film
","This is not 'Citizen Kane' or Shakespeare, but for what it is--an expensive caper flick--it's great fun.  The music & cinematography are terrific, and George Clooney has never been better.  The Julia Roberts character is the only main drawback; the writers just didn't develop it with any depth.",9,0,0,8 January 2002
Patton," Still Holds Up after 30 Years
","'Patton' was one of the first films I remember sitting through from beginning to end as a kid.  Loved it then, and after seeing it on DVD recently, I still love it.  Here's why: It is George C. Scott's best performance; the script is intelligent; the battle scenes are well staged; the photography (especially throughout Europe) is gorgeous; and it has one of the best scores ever.  Jerry Goldsmith hits every right note, from the swaggering title theme to the subtle, elegiac strings whenever Patton reminisces about his former lives. Bravo!",10,1,5,10 January 2003
The Godfather: Part III," A Complete Abomination
","Part III is dead in the water in every way. It's derivative in plot outline from the first two films; it has some awful acting stints by Pacino, Sophia Coppola, & Talia Shire, among others; and it insults the Catholic Church by positing as truth the murder of a pope. Critics have been way too indulgent with this dog! The Godfather saga seemed appropriately concluded at the end of Part II, when we're left with a heartless Michael aging alone in his blustery Tahoe home. That haunting scene is jettisoned in Part III when we're re-introduced to a redeemed, conscience-stricken Michael. Also, Pacino was the master of understatement in the first two films, so that when he exploded, you took notice. In Part III, alas, he's still stuck in his shouting, out-of-control acting schtick (see 'Heat' for more of that).Supposedly the future shoplifting Winona Ryder bowed out of III: but why, oh why would Coppola replace her with his talentless daughter? It's a key role, and her non-performance further taints the film. Stick to the first two!",1,40,69,16 January 2006
Gangs of New York," Day-Lewis is brilliant; sloppy rewriting of history is disappointing
","Daniel Day-Lewis has never been better.  See it for his performance.The historicity is badly mangled in several places, which is puzzling, since the actual history is entertaining enough.  Also, the film is a tad too claustrophobic (limited to a few interior & exterior sets); this either successfully captures the tiny local world of the Five Points--or reflects the limited number of sets that the budget would permit be built. 
The most conventional Scorsese movie I've seen (& that includes 'Cape Fear' too).",7,0,0,10 January 2003
Sully," Would Have Been a Great 45-Minute Film
","Disappointing. By exaggerating the evil of federal agencies & including too many of Sully's 'nightmares' that could have happened to his flight, Eastwood scratched out a feature-length film of 1 hr. 36 min. The scenes of the actual disaster are wonderful, but you can palpably tell where he's padding-out scenes & scenarios to stretch it out. A little very good movie within a so-so feature-length film. I was worried about this movie when it came out--it had generally good reviews, but I could tell from what I read that Eastwood resorted to what seemed to be flabby scenes, and so I waited till it came out on DVD.... And lo and behold! What I feared turned out to be true. Great in parts, flab in too many others.",6,0,0,6 January 2017
