Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Quentin, stop the drugs man!
","As if the first wasn't bad enough, I tortured myself a second time. I just don't get some of the other reviews which herald Quentin as the Ali-Baba of cinema. I'd say he's more like one of those guys from 'Dude, Where's My Car' who watched waaaaayyyy too many samurai films as a teenager.I won't disparage Uma Thurman or David Caradine for their continued roles, as they had to be committed a second time, although why Tarantino broke the film into two is beyond understanding. I will say I am surprised that Thurman and Caradine agreed to do this film in the first place. Maybe Caradine feels he's getting washed up or had some fantasy of playing an evil 'Grasshopper'. As for Uma, I think she put too much faith in Quentin after their time together in Pulp Fiction, which I enjoyed despite its taste for gross violence. This film takes the same idea of violence but then dubs in 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' into it. Thank heavens Quentin didn't ask Travolta or Jackson to show up as ninja bandits! And again, we have the philosophical mumbo-jumbo mixed in amongst expletives delivered in an silly macho tone. I guess the only good thing I can say for the sequel was the same thing I said for the first film, it has good action, albeit this one has a lot less. Sorry, their isn't another Crazy 88's fight. I say good riddance. 3/10",3,3,6,20 September 2004
Requiem for a Dream," A Down the Rabbit Hole View of Drugs
","Darren Aronofsky takes us through a worm hole into four lives on drugs and living its dangerous consequences. Much like the film 'Blow' with Johnny Depp, this movie is intended to show the false illusions concerning drugs and how selling narcotics catches up with you sooner or later. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is an indolent kid involved with heroin. He constantly troubles his mother in selling the household television to buy heroin. Harry's girlfriend, Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) is a spoiled girl whose previous trouble with the law have her constantly checking in with a probation officer. What is surprising about 'Requiem for a Dream' is that it attempts to completely show how drugs can devastate regardless of age or race. Harry's mother, Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), in a desperate effort to lose weight, becomes addicted to 'uppers.' Tyrone Love (Marlan Wayans) is a young black man trying to making something for himself with drugs and gangs. Aronofsky gives us mind-boggling effects with the young kids use of drugs and the repetitive 'You've Got Juice' slogan that sadly represent the attention and happiness Sara Goldfarb pines over. But the trip from moderate to severe is a wild ride. Everything seems perfect, for a time. And then all four characters get jarred around like passengers on a roller-coaster ride. MULTIPLE SPOILERS BELOW- we see how Harry, Marion, Tyrone become their own best customers in the drug trade. We also see how Sara Goldfarb becomes paranoid as her obsession and pride with a contest drives her past sanity. And perhaps the toughest thing to bear and the saddest is the ending. A far cry from any happy ending you'll ever see, Harry and Marion's addiction soon consumes what love they have. Harry lets his girlfriend sleep with another man in order to score some drug money. Ignoring a growing infection, Harry loses an arm to heroin. Marion loses what little self respect she has as she continues to whore herself out in order to get heroin. Tyrone finds out gangs are a dead end and that 'get rich quick' is better suited for fairy tales. Taking Harry to the hospital leaves Tyrone serving time in a racist prison. And in one of the more grim and bizarre conclusions, Sara Goldfarb becomes catatonic, becoming more alone than ever in her make-believe world.The most basic way the describe the film is to say 'it's a trip.' One that picks up your marbles and tosses them around a bit (congratulations Aronofsky). I was surprised yet admired the way he showed the pretentiousness of Sara Goldfarb and her mundane friends. The degradation Marion allows her self to suffer is quite shocking in the end. The 'You've Got Juice', Evil Refrigerator, and nervousness of Sara Goldfarb work together well to show her distancing connection to reality. Some things I thought were taken a bit afar or were an exaggeration from reality. One was Harry's loss of his arm. Nobody bothers to do anything about his infected arm, some make wisecracks (the police, prison guards, a doctor). Also, I thought Sara Goldfarb's devolution to a vegetable was way overblown and totally incredible. I think Aronofsky was so determined to give all the characters such a grim ending that he couldn't resist getting carried away in this regard. But it is gratuitous as we could see the devastating effects Sara suffered and her loss of Harry to prison would have obvious effects on her. While certain aspects of the ending are a bit much, the film does succeed at giving you a bad taste in your mouth for drugs. Although it may be an apropos portrayal of some of the 'potential' consequences of a life involved with drugs, this film sure is depressing! 7/10",8,1,2,17 October 2004

The Ring," A Real Horror Movie!
","So you're disgusted with today's horror spinoffs of previous spinoffs, which are still as pathetic as some of their predecessors, only the director has add a few topless girls and some flesh eating to try and gross you out.  It you are a true horror fan of any kind you will agree that this just does not cut it.  We want to be scared.  And how can you take a film seriously when you have a mutant alligator eating the villagers, hmmm...?  Anyway, The Ring manages to achieve what others horror flicks have not - to scared the ghost out of you.Based on the Japanese film, Ringu, The Ring spins a modern-day equivalent to the Exorcist, with the whole demonic girl idea.  What it does that The Exorcist did not (despite Exorcist being a better horror), was that The Ring developed the story beyond demonic possession into a mysterious and macabre down-the-rabbit hole investigation of how, Samara (the demonic girl), came to be.I have loved horror films since a tot and through the years have only seen a few that were truly frightening or horrifically disturbing.  I can easily say that this film is the only horror that comes to mind in the past 5-10 years that was a good fright.  I highly recommend seeing it and as a test of how brave you are, watch the film alone one night with the lights off.  Then go to be later that night and see if you don't hide under the covers.  :)",Null,1,2,19 May 2004
Minority Report," Spielberg Picks Another Good Story
","We quite often give sole credit to the director of a good movie, and while this is deserved, we must also recognize the individual that envisioned and created the basis for the movie in the first place - the writer.  I have been impressed with quite a bit of Spielberg's work (save that of A.I.) but have not until Minority Report paid attention to where the ideas came from. The reason I did so with this movie was that the plot was so fantastic and bursting with creativity that I was almost compelled to investigate this source of its genius, Philip K. Dick.  Spielberg made this literary gem into a feast for the eyes.  No stone seems to go unturned in creating a realistic world of the future.  From cars to advertising to appliances, Spielberg assembles it all.  And to garner some of the best that Hollywood has to offer, he enlists the services of Tom Cruise.  Cruise plays the protagonist, Detective John Anderton, in a futuristic tale of a world where a crime can been predicted.  A 'precrime' bureau is assembled to stop that which hasn't happened yet - future murder. Anderton's embrace of precrime is due to the loss of his only child, who was abducted.  When Anderton stumbles upon a flaw in the precrime system, he is setup and hunted down by his own agency.  The story begs the question that if you knew the future, is it predestined that you would still make the same choices, despite your knowledge of what was about to happen?  Can you change the course of events to come?Detective Anderton discovers that not everything in life, now or in the future, is merely black and white and that no looking-glass ball is perfect. For a wild roller-coaster ride of a movie that has some of the most creative and plausible ideas of the future, I highly recommend you watch Minority Report.",8,0,1,25 May 2004
Monster," Beauty Turned Beast
","I have seen a few transformations in my time, but I can't recall one as shocking as Charlize Theron's in Monster.  The babe most audiences have become accustomed to (The Italian Job, Devil's Advocate, etc.) underwent an enormous physical change as she took on the part of Aileen Wuornos. 
The role of Wuornos is that of older prostitute who has a trailer-park nature about her (no offense intended to trailer parks owners or patrons) and knows nothing other than sex serving as a way to make ends meet.  The portrayal of Wuornos is designed to be a sympathetic one, intended to show the difficulties of 'hooking' and how such characters develop from a troubled childhood and other crises in life.  Wuornos ends up meeting a young girl, Selby (Christina Ricci), whose infatuation with her makes Wuornos feel truly loved and cared about for the first time in her life.  Wuornos then attempts to 'hook' enough money to take her and Selby out of a small Florida town.  But when she is beaten and sodomized by one of her johns, it causes Wuornos to start a killing spree that doesn't end until seven men are dead.This movie attempts to show us the ugly horrors that some of the considered 'low' people in life experience.  It shows Wuornos as another human being suffering from some grim realities of life while altogether ignorant of others.  The film also tries to show you a kind side to Wuornos and why she acted as she did in murdering so many people.  But while the plot confronts the hardships and injustices Wuornos suffered, this in no way justifies her murderous actions.Overall, GREAT acting by Theron and Ricci in what almost seems like  Thelma & Louise at times.  This movie is definitely not intended for a younger audience and the overall nature of the film will probably appear somewhat depressing to most adult viewers.",6,0,1,14 July 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Strangely Funny
","For a horror flick, someone definitely had to be having a bit of fun with this one. We all pretty much know this story from the original and it's sequels, in which a bunch of people are turned into zombies and begin eating other people. What made this version unique was its gore (way up there) and some of the comedic scenes. In this film we (SPOILER) even get a zombie baby! Our 'heroes' are shacked up in a mall most of the film with Ving Rhames as Mr. Macho, playing a weird game of 'Shoot the Celebrity Look-Alike Zombie' from the mall's rooftop. They stay there so long that people start making their own homes out of each store and begin forming relationships (the scene with the couple and the store video camera is ridiculously funny). In fact, that would describe much of this movie, except for the fact we have to take it somewhat seriously just due to the amount of blood and gore (much like Cabin Fever). Don't expect a happy ending in this one (remember 'Return of the Living Dead'?). If you watch the ending credits, you'll get a bit of Blair-Witch-type footage which is pretty good. 6/10",6,1,2,7 February 2005
Shaun of the Dead," A Scary Movie Dawn of the Dead
","Just reading the back cover or seeing the previews for this film, you know exactly what to expect. But can the British pull off a comedic 'Dawn of the Dead' that is funnier than the original? Well, maybe.Simon Pegg plays Shaun, an ordinary guy who is clueless about romance and the dereliction of his friend Ed (Nick Frost). In a hilarious portrayal of just how oblivious someone can be to the world around him, Shaun, bent on winning his girlfriend back, travels the city with zombies wandering about. It isn't until much later that he and his buddy Ed discover they are the new minority in town. There are some very funny scenes like attacking a pair of zombies with a record collection and zombie impersonation as a means of disguise. For a silly, brainless look at the recent zombie-film resurgence (28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, etc.), watch 'Shaun of the Dead'. 6/10",6,1,5,26 February 2005
The Girl Next Door," Every Teen Guy's Fantasy...Almost
","For those of you who saw 'Milk Money' with Melanie Griffith, this movie runs along the same lines. Basically, you have a beautiful woman with a seedy background who falls in love with your average guy living in the burbs. 'The Girl Next Door' takes things down to a teen level though when a former porn star moves in next door to a boy and steals his heart. Elisha Cuthbert (sure to be famous for her sizzling looks alone) plays the former porn star Danielle. Emile Hirsch plays head-over-heels Matthew Kidman. The film teeters a bit on how convincing it is, despite the unusual circumstances. It's interesting to note how Matthew treats Danielle like the sex toy he thinks she is when he discovers her past. I think this stigma or stereotype is probably true for most guys and how they think of porn stars, which makes a serious relationship all but impossible. What is unconvincing is how Danielle goes along with this. But perhaps she's just used to being treated this way even though she clearly wants a different future. I guess on a serious note and looking at the bigger picture, you could look at the whole film and wonder how realistically it portrays a porn star's life. Are there those that want to quit and just can't seem to get out of the industry, either because they are under duress or just don't have any skills...? And what about their boyfriends, husbands, etc.? Do they and should they accept their career choices or is there a better and more wholesome life out there they can help them achieve? I don't mean to sound too didactic, as 'The Girl Next Door' is just a love story (obviously a bit complex though). Don't worry about the film being as serious as I am in its description. Plenty of laughs and nail-biting moments are had with a funny and surprising ending. 7/10",7,0,0,20 March 2005
Spider-Man 2," The Webslinger Returns
","Tobey Maguire is back in action as Spiderman in the sequel to the original blockbuster hit. But this time he faces a new villain, Dr. Octopus. An experiment attempting to tap into the power of fusion energy goes awry. Dr. Otto Octavius is then transformed into a maniacal creature controlled via an input into his brain by the artificial intelligence of four mechanical arms welded onto him. It is unclear why the arms were needed for his fusion energy project though.Multiple SPOILERS below.Meanwhile, Peter Parker just can't seem to get a break. His alternate lifestyle as Spiderman is costing him his job, his grades, and most of all the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). She has given up waiting on Peter and plans to wed an officer.At the same time and almost as some supernatural message, Spiderman begins to lose his 'spidey powers'. He no longer is able to sling webs, climb walls, have perfect vision, and superhuman strength. Peter Parker takes this as a sign that maybe he no longer is no longer supposed to be Spiderman. Maybe he has a choice to decide who he is to be.With that thought in mind, Peter abandons his superhero lifestyle. His new carefree attitude has him leaving crime to the cops as Spiderman has quit the job. He intends to live a normal life and confess his love for Mary Jane.But just as soon as he has altered his perspective on life, he receives some wise words from his Aunt May. She wonders where Spiderman has gone, as heroes give people hope and courage. They give the promise of a better tomorrow. In each of us is a hero who can do the right thing even if it means giving up our dreams. For Peter, this is a life of fighting crime and losing Mary Jane. He realizes protecting the city is more important.Harry Osborn, whose father was killed by Spiderman in the original, has struck a bargain with Dr. Octopus by agreeing to give him a crucial element of the fusion project he is reconstructing in return for bringing Spiderman to him. The ensuing battle between Octopus and Spiderman is riddled with action. But what is most shocking is that our superhero is unmasked before and entire group of passengers on a train. His efforts at trying to save the train from peril and the physical stress he endures mark his care and concern for helping others. The passengers agree to keep his identity a secret as the admiration for Spiderman endures.Taken captive and returned to Harry Osborne, Spiderman is unmasked just before a knife is about to be plunged into him. Harry is overcome by shock that the entire time it was his best friend that was his father's murderer. Spiderman escapes and quickly flees to save the city from the destructive energy of Dr. Octopus' fusion project.Mary Jane remains hostage (again) as Spiderman battles with the mad scientist in a decrepit warehouse on the river. But Dr. Octopus' defeat is in Spiderman's reminder that intelligence is to be used for the good of mankind. The mechanical arms were controlling him for evil purposes. Intent on not dying a monster, Dr. Octavius destroys his fusion project, sinking it into the river.Unmasked before Mary Jane for the first time stands Peter Parker as Spiderman. They confess their love for one another but Peter knows he cannot allow her to share a life with him where she would be put into danger. Their love can never be.On her wedding day, Mary Jane looks into her heart for the truest answer of 'I do.' She finds that the answer is with Peter Parker. She jilts the officer she is supposed to marry and runs to Peter's slum apartment. There she tells him that she has a choice too. She is the one who can choose for herself a life of risk in order to be with him. It is her decision. Ironically she has already been abducted twice due to her friendship with Peter.And so Hollywood has another happy ending. In the conclusion we are given a sneak peak into the birth of The Green Goblin as Harry Osborn finds a secret arsenal of his father's Hobgoblin weapons. While this is an unlikely event it is even more so that Harry would run his father's company with a board of directors involved. While this movie has just as much action as the original, the love story is not as memorable. What this sequel does and does well is to further develop Spiderman as a human being with all the same emotions, flaws, and conflicts that afflict us all. And his triumph over some and ability to weather other human aspects are what truly define him as a superhero.",7,0,1,30 June 2004
Troy," Drawn Out Pretty-Boy Story
","It's no surprise that this film was set up with female audiences in mind when they cast Brad Pitt as the lead role. Complete with golden locks and a surfer's tan, Pitt plays Greek hero Achilles. 'Troy' is the modern day re-creation of the Trojan War. For those unfamiliar with mythological history, Achilles was the mightiest of the Trojans in the war, suffering only one weak spot, his heel. The film brings this and other common legends (the Trojan horse ambush) together with an expensive budget to back up fight scenes similar to 'Braveheart' and 'The Patriot'. Unfortunately, 'Troy' carries on unrelentless and seemingly oblivious to the staminas of the audience (runs just under three hours). The later half represents a weak pulse to a dramatic conclusion, which quite honestly was something of a let down. And despite following legend, the whole Trojan horse bit seemed to far fetched, but then again.....5/10",5,1,3,30 April 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," The Chill Got Me
","In short, this film is about a national emergency, like many other Roland Emmerich films. What makes this one different is that it entertains the concept of the world going through another ice age - the day after tomorrow.While many critics and professionals concerned with national emergencies and meteorology denounced the possibly of this film ever being reality, it still makes for an interesting story. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a climatologist, who, along with help of Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) discovers that the climate is changing at a rapid rate due to the shifting currents in the Atlantic Ocean. As the thermometer begins its plummet, Jack races to try and rescue his teenage son (Jake Glyllenhaal-a.k.a.: Donnie Darko) and a group of friends to safety. I do have to say that one scene with a bunch of CG (computer-generated) wolves is pretty lame, although intended to be suspenseful. Dennis and Jake play a good father/son team and all the other acting is well done. I was especially enthralled with Emmy Rossum. She reminds me of a young Mia Sara.I see her acting career going a long way! Sela Ward adds a few heartfelt moments (why isn't she in more movies?). What was most entertaining/laughable was as I was watching this film, myself and a bunch of friends started to feel cold. By the end of the movie, we all felt freezing! You may want to have a blanket on standby for this one! 7/10",7,1,2,29 October 2004
Ocean's Twelve," Connect The Invisible Dots?!
","I have said it time and time again that no matter what kind of a cast you have, if the story isn't there, neither will be the movie. 'Ocean's Twelve' definitely has the cast (Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, etc.) and while it does have some story, it falls way short of its casting achievements. In a sense, there is little equilibrium between actors and the plot, which later just makes you wonder if you can get people to go to the theaters just by mustering up an incredible amount of star power...? Answer: yes.'Ocean's Twelve' picks up where 'Ocean's Eleven' left off, with Daniel Ocean (George Clooney) and his crew trying to enjoy the fruits of their ill-gotten labors. Unfortunately, a competitor-thief (The Night Fox) has tipped off Andy Garcia to the whereabouts of Daniel and his crew and now Andy wants his money back, plus interest. The criminals work out a plan to repay the money but things begin to go awry when a former girlfriend and detective picks up on their trail (Catherine Zeta-Jones). A challenge is made by the Night Fox in which he will pay the price on their heads if they can steal a priceless egg. It's sort of a 'whoever is the best thief wins' type of thing.While this is an entertaining enough story, its contents are jumbled together straight from the opening. There is no clear succession in the film's plot and with so many characters, it jumps around quite often. It also feels like many pieces are missing and makes the viewer feel that either the film is lacking in discussion or that the audience consists of a bunch of dolts. Other aspects don't make any sense at all even from a Hollywood perspective (unless of course this was some dry satire). You'll be asking yourself plenty of questions as to the possibility of the ending, which to save you some breath and frustration, I will tell you that is next to impossible and furthermore isn't worth spinning your wheels on. I can understand why the behind-the-scenes interviews all came back with the cast saying they had an incredibly fun time making this film. I just wish the audience could say the same thing regarding watching it. 4/10",4,0,0,30 April 2005
Final Destination 2," Biggest Shock - The Lame Ending
","As a director I would think you would have things made after the success of the original Final Destination directed by James Wong and written by Jeffrey Reddick.  You have a great story given to you and a good solid format to follow - horror, suspense, horror, suspense.And the director of the sequel seemed to understand this, as David Ellis follows the footsteps of Wong.  He does a great job of shocking you and leaving you guessing as to who is going to die next and how.  However, what is most disappointing and horribly tragic about the sequel is that it does not deliver in its conclusion.  The first ended with the same suspense that drove the entire film.  In the second, it seems Reddick through together a cheap new twist and then had Director Ellis give a hack job of an ending, complete with all the cheesiness in the world.  You watch 3/4's of a great film to be left with putty of an ending.  I saw that Final Destination 3 is in production for 2006 with James Wong back at the helm.  I feel sorry for the guy because now he has the challenge of luring viewers back to the series after Ellis screwed it up.",4,0,1,1 July 2004
Fargo," What Did I Miss Here?!
","Okay, so I've heard of the litany of accolades this movie has received. I've heard how this film is a 'black comedy' by the Coen Brothers, who supposedly are geniuses in the film industry.  And I've listened to friends discuss how creative and wonderful the film is.  But none of this, I repeat, NONE OF THIS, is apparent in this movie.  What I watched was a film confused at whether to be serious or comedic.  And in making up its mind, both elements are fused together in a twisted fashion with an out-of-place Canadian humor.  Basically the story is about a car salesman who needs cash...fast, so he pays a couple of guys to kidnap his wife so that her rich father will pay the ransom, thereby getting him the cash he needs.  Well, all goes to hell as the kidnappers end up on a killing spree with a cop questioning all possible leads, including the car salesman himself.If in fact this film was based on a true story (as indicated at the beginning), I would be horrified if I were close to one of the victims.  The Coen brothers make a strange mockery out of the deaths of the victims portrayed and deter the audience from taking the film seriously, instead giving them a quasi-mental hypothermia with the serious/humorous dichotomy. And even if this film is not based on a true story, it is so poorly directed that I just felt like I had wasted my time going around in circles.  But yet I'll walk out my front door and everyone will still be applauding this satirical trash.  Sigh.  What did I miss here?!",2,124,218,22 August 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Further Down the Disappointment Rabbit Hole
","Okay, so Matrix Reloaded couldn't compare to the original.  Few sequels can, so this is somewhat expected.  But Reloaded did have those phaser-guys and the 3 million dollar highway chase which appeared to pay off rather well. Neo is further developed into Superman, etc.  My point in all of this Reloaded regurgitation is to tell you that Matrix Revolutions, in terms of new introductions since the original Matrix, had a big nada.  And it almost breaks my heart to say it since I absolutely loved the genius of the original.  Not just the special effects in it but the story as well.  What is even more sad is that the third installment doesn't even utilize the talents of the cast well since most of the time you are being overrun with special effects.  Typically in storytelling the introduction and the conclusion are one of the most important elements that 'house' the body. They respectively pique curiosity and give lasting impressions.  While The Matrix definitely got everyones' attention, Revolutions ran out of gas on leaving an positive lasting remembrance.  The trilogy sort of reminds me of an exam I took once.  On the first portion I took quite a bit of time, re-read my answers, and double-checked my work.  As a result my scores were great.  The second half I was a little cursory, but still managed to go back and review.  My scores were satisfactory but not as exceptional as before. On the last part of the test I realized I was severely running out of time and hastily ended up 'Christmas treeing' a portion of it.  No surprise that the results were poor.  Matrix Revolutions was the same  Christmas-tree ending.  Maybe they didn't budget money well as I should have budgeted time well on my exam.",3,0,0,1 May 2004
The Village," Shown To Believe
","M. Night Shyamalan is well known for his ability to invoke suspense and surprise endings. This film keeps with his other works such as 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable'. But much like those films, it is also designed to make you look at things a certain way. The surprise endings that are often unguessable are due to Shyamalan's cleverness in making the audience see things from a staged point of view without even realizing it. This is the very reason none of us knew Bruce Willis was a ghost in 'The Sixth Sense'. 'The Village' can easily be summarized as a community that is haunted by some darkness in the surrounding woods. The details of such take us to a place that appears remote and colonial. All of this becomes apparent in the natives' dress and their speech. Communication and transportation are primitive and farming represents the town's livelihood. The audience at this point has a very clear sense that they are watching an older, bygone way of life.Now, about the darkness...there are creatures that lurk in the nearby woods. A relationship exists between the creatures and the townspeople, where the townsfolk stay out of the woods and the creatures leave them be. Not surprising, this 'truce' is broken and the creatures start to pay little visits. At this point you feel like you are watching an old-world, horror-type film. Good camera work, a good cast (includes Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, and Joaquin Phoenix), and excellent suspense make this an interesting tale. Everything is amplified when one of the community members is stabbed and needs medicine. Then the story begins to involve how the community has sequestered itself from the outside world and is haunted by the forest creatures.Where things get a bit shaky is in the whole idea for the film. Please do not read on if you don't wish to know the ending. The ending reveals that the 'portrayed town' we've been watching is actually the creation of a bunch of city goers in today's world that wanted to start their own society. While a most clever idea, retrospect shows that the way the town operated, you would think someone would have found out the truth already. And the town certainly wasn't that old, with the first generation members being William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver. How did they manage to move and create a colony and then turn around and invent myths that were law? And the fact that all the town elders were cowards enough to send a blind girl to get medicine was just plain sad. Did they know that if they sent a blind girl, they would remain undiscovered? And to think the whole thing was justified by the injustices they experienced in the modern world. Kudos to William Hurt for his performance in showing how the elders were committing their own injustices. Anybody think the town held together and there'll be a Village 2? 8/10 P.S.: An excellent job is done in the woods scene with Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter), where you begin to think the monsters might actually be real.",8,0,1,27 February 2005
Pitch Black," Thus Begins Riddick!
","This story is the prequel to Chronicles of Riddick. But don't be fooled. I don't think Pitch Black was ever made with the intention of producing a sequel. I think Vin Diesel just became a big enough star that someone decided to continue the character of Riddick. This whole thing is sort of the reverse of 'Remo Williams-The Adventure Begins,' where the title would suggest a sequel maybe even a trilogy. But no, they started off with a big-shot title that never took flight other than its original film. I never could figure out why though. I mean, it's not all that bad of a movie.Anyway, excuse my departure from the subject - Pitch Black. This film is a sci-fi/horror about a group of survivors who crash land on a deserted planet. But one of their passengers is a serial killer - Riddick. This surprised me in that I would have thought Vin to be the hero (which in a way he semi-becomes but not blatantly). Soon the unfamiliar companions realize there is something else to fear on the planet that is worse than Riddick. Bodies soon turn up missing.This film does a good job with CGI for the creatures and Vin Diesel's character, while still an enigma at the end of the film, surprisingly portrays a backward struggle to compassion. And Radha Mitchell does will in playing a starship pilot seeking redemption. While these themes transpire nicely in the film, the main focus, of course, is on the alien creatures. The gore definitely brings the sci-fi into the horror level. Some good suspense scenes too, where the director draws you in to sympathize with the stranded crew, each of whom seem to have their own conflict. Just don't be misled in thinking you'll see Vin-Riddick as the superhero that Chronicles of Riddick make him out to be. In this film, his motto is, 'When the Bad Get Good.' 7/10",7,0,0,29 October 2004
Cold Mountain," A Return to Classica
","Probably one of the more pronounced impressions of this film is its dusty and nostalgic feeling for old classics.  It has all the right ingredients - a small farm town, a southern belle, her farmhand lover, a war, villains and deceivers everywhere, and your immortal tragedy.  But in order to bake a cake it takes more than just ingredients, it also takes exquisite chefs. And who better for such a job than Jude Law, Renee Zellweger, Nicole Kidman, Donald Sutherland, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Natalie Portman.I found the most difficult part of the movie to digest in terms of plot to be the short-lived courtship of Ada Monroe (Kidman) and Inman (Jude Law). Once you can accept that their almost nonexistent relationship has had an enormous effect on them both, the movie seems to movie along without further questioning.  The plot is very simple.  It is the Civil War and Inman is a confederate officer gone off to war.  Ada agrees to wait for him but months and then years pass.  To help her survive, Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) comes to help her on the farm.  The two become close friends during dark times.  The only thing keeping Inman going out on the battlefield is the letters he receives from Ada.  When she tells him to come back to her he obeys, but the journey home proves harder than he ever could have imagined.I have wondered how true to life some of the elements of this story are. More men died in the Civil War than all the other wars combined.  That alone should give some indication of how gruesome life was at that time.  But for those that lived on or who sat at home and waited, praying for their loved ones to return, what was it like for them?  This movie tries to give some indication of that existence.  The horrors it shows I can only hope weren't real but in my gut believe they could have been much worse. 
This movie seemed to depict how two young people were trying not to fall in love and yet despite themselves did so completely.  Outside influence symbolized by the war is so determined to break them apart in their struggle towards one another.  When all else appears to have to gone to hell, these two individuals cling tightly to what they believe and pray they have left - each other.",7,0,0,30 June 2004
American Psycho," Apt Title
","Christian Bale lets his dark side out to play in this thriller about a playboy gone delusional. Bale plays the renowned Patrick Bateman but is cast in a much different setting - corporate America. While not given any background as to his psychotic break, Bateman appears to us initially through his stream-of-consciousness, in which we get to hear what is going on inside his head. By day Bateman is the son a corporate mogul, but by night he is fueled by his insatiable carnal and murderous cravings. The corporate world in which he lives in is portrayed as being grossly decadent, full of nothing but materialism and foolish pride. But Bale's intense desire to maintain appearances and be the perfect facade or image of what people are looking for, make him all the more dangerous. Underneath the surface, his hold on reality begins to slip away. His introverted nature cares only for his pride as he competes against his coworkers and fulfills his sexual ego in his relations with several whores. When he loses touch with reality and the consequences of his actions, the blood begins to flow.'American Psycho' is a unique look at how people have different sides to their personality, some of which are scarily schizophrenic. It gives us a bizarre behind-the-scenes look at a very disturbed individual, much like the film 'One Hour Photo', although I wouldn't say 'American Psycho' has as much creepy plausibility. 4/10",6,1,2,7 February 2005
"I, Robot"," Bicentennial Man Meets The Matrix
","As my caption clearly states, this film was a merger of two others. The idea of a robot capable of emotion and the robotic laws (Bicentennial Man) encounters a plot where a battle is waged between robots and humans (The Matrix). If you've seen both of those movies then you have an exact idea of what this film is about. Otherwise, be prepared to see the following.Will Smith plays some old-school cop. Old-school would be considered today's standards as this film is futuristic. While I've seen Smith in convincing heroic roles (Independence Day, Men In Black, Bad Boys), I just didn't get the feel that he was quite right for the role. There was some sort of unnatural state he was in for most of the first half of the film. I don't usually get this feeling from most chosen actors, but he definitely stood out. Smith is a detective who has a grudge against robots after they saved his life instead of a young girl's. The shoulder-rubbing scenes are dragged out until almost the end before we really discover their true nature. And the portrayal of the futuristic surroundings look like moderate attempts at creativity; nothing as good as 'Minority Report'. *SPOILERS* I still think Bridget Moynahan's character is a robot, although the film never depicts her as such. Maybe she is to be some undiscovered secret of a sequel...? This film departs from most robot films in showing a confrontation between an artificial intelligence that is still bound by program and that of an artificial intelligence that is almost completely human in its emotional capability. Add into the mix those robots still completely bound by program, and you have a three-way robot mix that (as long as you hold on) doesn't become dizzying for too long. In fact, my impressions from the trailer were that every robot would start to become self aware and there would be a giant robot-human war. Sure the story's been told a few times, but there's always another way to show it. Instead, the movie goes a slightly different route, one that I can't exactly say made for all that stellar of a film. 5/10 Also, what is the significance (if any) in the ending? Sonny is the one on the top of the hill instead of Smith, which is altogether different from what was described in Sonnny's dream.",5,0,0,16 December 2004
Wanted," Know What You're Getting Yourself Into
","I saw the trailers, like everybody else, that were run up and down the block. The big thing was the curving bullets and the assassin son right-of-passage bit. I gathered it was a new-kind of Matrix-style- effects film. I guess, somewhat in that sense, the film delivered. But the first five minutes had me surprised at the cheap-trick hype of vulgarity usage. Another half hour in and I thought okay, this is like 'Shoot 'Em Up' except no Clive Owen. Another fifteen minutes later, as the plot unravels, Angelina Jolie isn't good-looking enough to overcome disinterest in the film. And lastly, I'm thinking, 'Wow, at least 'Shoot 'Em Up' came off as an action farce. All you had to do was just sit back, laugh, and watch the bullets fly.' 'Wanted' attempts to delve into a complex plot amid action and drama. But the drama fails to deliver and things only get corny toward the end. After seeing Morgan Freeman last week in 'Bucket List' and respecting his reputation as an actor, I was surprised he signed on. James McAvoy's performance in 'Last King of Scotland' only makes this film look like he decided to go on acting vacation. And Angelina Jolie......well, expect more Tomb Raider, without the accent. It seems like too many actors with potential are getting role happy these days. What film will Jason Statham show up in next?",4,4,10,11 July 2008
Van Helsing," Good CGI and action, but little emphasis on story
","If you want today's non-stop action and explosive adventure scenes, then this movie will provide little disappointment.  However, if you are also looking for any drama backed by a well-thought storyline, then you may find this film coming up shy.The plot is rather simple.  A monster-hunter recruited by the Vatican, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), embarks on a mission to kill the evil Count Dracula. To spice things up a bit, he also has to face The Werewolf and Frankenstein.  These classic confrontations are not much different from any other film other than the computer-generated images (CGI) that are included. Van Helsing has a selection of weapons that are a medieval version of the toys James Bond has.  And also like Bond films, Kate Beckinsale provides the necessary alluring femme fatale role.  Also of this you can gather from the thirty second trailer if you've seen it, but like all trailer's, they are designed to hype the film. There is some irony in Jackman's Wolverine role from X-Men, but to keep from spoiling the movie I will spare you the details.  I can however say that looking for some plausibility and trying to digest the details of the movies progression may prove challenging and in the end, pointless.  I was given the impression too much was left to chance in the storyline on how things came to pass, and since I was being fed new information at such a rapid rate, I was left to believe it was a snow-job on the director's part.  But not to frown on the movie too much, I can tell you that you are taken on a wild adventure/crusade against evil.  There isn't any real gore or intense violence in the film.  Most of the violence is the classic vampire impaling with CGI to enhance the subsequent death.  I found the movie far from scary but more action-oriented.",Null,0,0,7 May 2004
Collateral," Odd Roles for Both
","This film definitely takes a bit of a turn from previous roles for both Jamie Fox and Tom Cruise. Cruise plays a hit man who uses a cabbie's services to complete a list of marks for the evening. The cabbie, played by Fox, is a well-educated man who almost comes across as not fitting the part correctly. I'm not trying to slant cab drivers, but Fox didn't seem convincing, maybe because of his comedic background. Cruise wasn't much better. For a guy that usually plays the hero's role, seeing him act darkly was a first. I will say that his new image (grayish hair, unshaven look) helped him at least look the part. The polished wit and outfit gave him a distinguished presence. But then his philosophy on life, psychology, etc. threw him out of the stereotypical hit-man mix. In the end, I guess they both were so oddly paired for their roles that the director thought the movie could work. But really, how plausible is any film where a contract killer uses a taxi-cab driver as his personal chauffeur for killing people?! The outrageousness of that alone is almost too much, albeit sensationalism is one of the things viewers can't seem to resist. 4/10",4,3,4,19 March 2005
The Butterfly Effect," Great idea but denies title
","The title The Butterfly Effect refers to the ability of even the beating wings of a butterfly to upset the balance of the world. For time travel, even the slightest change can dramatically alter the future. While this movie excels in creativity, much like Donnie Darko, it presents too many holes in direct violation of the premise of its title. For instance, (SPOILER) when Evan (Aston Kutcher) is trying to prove to his prison cellmate that Jesus talks to him, he goes back in time as a child and stabs his hands into two sharp points. When he comes back to the present, he is still in the prison cell with the scars on his hands. If even a butterfly's wings can alter the course of history, then surely that act could have completely altered Evan's future to where he may not even be in prison anymore.Maybe as a way to compensate for this paradoxical display, the movie goes overboard in the opposite direction by showing how Evan can alter people through words (such as his confrontation of Kayleigh's dad). And in almost all the scenarios Tommy turns out a bad seed, except for his illogical saving of a mom and her baby. He then becomes something of a born-again Christian. It's too big a stretch. Basically the concept is very creative for this film but more attention to detail could have been given to make for a more convincing and concrete story. Granted, it is hard to manipulate alternate futures to reach the best outcome, but then again, that is the theme behind the movie.",6,3,7,30 June 2004
Alien vs. Predator," What Happened?!
","I was initially disappointed in knowing this film was going to be rated PG-13, in an effort to soak up all teenagers the producers could muster. All of the Alien and Predator films were rated 'R' for a very good reason. And anyone who felt and understood the horror, suspense, disgust, etc. from the work of those films would have shook their head (just as I did) at the mere mention of a PG-13 rating. To combine some of the fictitious universe's most feared creatures and have them go head-to-head under a PG-13 rating is almost comical.Nonetheless, I watched AVP and was pretty impressed for about half the film. The big fight scene with an alien and a predator was definitely the best of the whole film. The director managed to execute all the gore and mayhem he could without really getting too explicit. Quite a bit of the violence is actually suggested. I guess after having seen the Alien Quadrilogy, you really don't need to see a bunch of facehuggers jump on people to know what's about to happen. But even with these 'saving graces' to do the film credit, the second half (normally the more important of the two) peters out big time. Instead of getting a massive battle of a bunch of predators fighting a swarm of aliens, (SPOILER) we see one predator and a woman fleeing from an explosion that takes out all the aliens. And just to show how Hollywood sometimes never changes, we get a repeat of 'Aliens' with the queen alien surviving the explosion. A final battle ensues with the predator and woman taking on the queeny.Maybe there just wasn't the budget to execute one of the best 'versus' battles out there, because this film could have easily added another thirty minutes to an hour of footage. I think too much time was wasted in showing the human expedition team trying to uncover/discover the temple. And the whole bit of using the aliens as part of predator warrior training was a bit hokey, but not near as hokey as the ending. Can anyone say 'Predalien'? 4/10",4,1,2,7 February 2005
28 Days Later...," Closing your eyes you can pick a better movie.
","I could go into detail and bore you with endless ramblings and a huge rant on what a disaster this movie was.  But let me sum up my feelings with what movie experience I have in seven words:  WORST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN TO DATE. Before that it was Midnight Mass, which even though it was a waste of time and I had to fast forward through it, may still have had 28 Days Later beat. What they both have in common is that is looks like a bunch of kids at your local university produced them.  And no, none of these kids was gifted by any means.  All I can say is thankfully I have shied away from the macabre genre for a while so that I am not abused by seeing a movie that might be worse than 28 Days Later.",Null,2,3,1 May 2004
Hellboy," Finally, a worth-while superhero movie!
","Action?  Adventure?  Ugly-looking monstrosities?  A tough-as-nails superhero? What about the beautiful female role?This movie delivers on all of the above.  And it's about time a movie did. Hellboy represents the comic-book-like superhero of evil who has been used for good.  And who better for the job than Ron Perlman, who give us a stellar performance.  Hellboy is a cinematic narration about a demon who is rescued by the U.S. during our war with the Nazis.  He was transported through a portal the Nazis created in a search for ultimate power.  Hellboy then grows up to be your neighborhood superhero who slays paranormal vermin that 'go bump in the night'.The movie delivers some great fight scenes and uses good CG to enhance the effects.  And just as Tobe McGuire has shown us Spiderman as just as much human as superhuman, so has Ron Perlman in Hellboy's feelings of grotesqueness and love.  The story isn't too complex so digestion/contemplation doesn't ruin the film.",Null,0,0,16 May 2004
The Incredibles," Incredible(s)!
","After watching this one in the theater I could think of little I was disappointed in. The animation mirrored 'Shrek' and in some cases I think exceeded it. The story is action-packed with superheros and adds humor in their real-life depictions. What surprised me is that the film also adds good family values and the usual cartoon programming, yet still delivers on an adult level. Some of you may remember Spielberg's 'Animaniacs' produced by Warner Brothers. Now that was some great cartoon comedy that satisfied children and adults! I would have to say that 'The Incredibles' also does a very good job of this. For good cartoon comedy sure to entertain the whole family, watch this one! 9/10",9,0,1,16 December 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Amp'ed Up But Poor Punch
","When the original Resident Evil debuted during the video-game-movie frenzy, it held a lot of promise. The formula for such a movie was almost guaranteed given the detailed and interesting nature of the game itself. And then followed the movie, with the convincing lead, Milla Jovanovich, whose protagonist role in Fifth Element proved she could handle action. The film held plenty of disturbing scenes and good CGI. And at the end we were given the intimation of a sequel, which was delivered in the form of this film, Resident Evil: Apocalypse. But instead of a bunch of zombies locked up in an underground laboratory, they run amuck in Raccoon City, with the T-virus spreading like wildfire. Obviously, the film could simply enough had Alice (Jovanovich) just go out and wipe out the entire city of zombies, with a little help, of course. But no, this film wanted to flex its muscles and push the envelope. Not only is Raccoon City scheduled for termination via a nuclear attack by the Umbrella Corporation (the bad guys), but it turns out that there is another danger looking in Raccoon City, Nemesis (a biogenetically-engineered killer). And to take things up yet another notch, it turns out Alice has been injected with the T-virus by Umbrella and has superhuman strength as a result. Talk about amp'ing up the plot!For all her fight scenes in Fifth Element, I could not believe the botch job that was done with Alice's combat scenes against Nemesis, as Umbrella has a final showdown before they send the A-bomb in. The action sequences were so fast and jumbled together that it was impossible to make any clear distinction of what was happening. It's almost pathetic.As to the ending, I won't spoil it, but be prepared to go round the ferris wheel once again as yet another sequel is hinted at, this one even more preposterous. After watching the ending of the film (if you choose to), ask yourself why Umbrella didn't just 'activate' Alice in the lab when she was 'spazzing' out on them. Why wait until she was outside the gate...? 5/10",5,1,7,19 September 2004
Shrek 2," A Close 2nd
","Exiting the theater, I was engulfed in a strange mental cloud of sorts after having just watched Shrek 2.  The experience was one of confusion: WHY CAN'T ALL SEQUELS BE THIS GOOD?  Its not like Dreamworks did anything that they weren't good at and knew how to deliver on, great comedy transmitted through excellent animation.  Maybe directors should be required to do animation before they actually go out in the world and work with real people and a try to develop a real story.  I think of all the sequels I have seen and some of them I absolutely cringe at the thought of.  But Shrek 2 was a spectacular sequel, a close 2nd to its predecessor.  And what's even better with this type of film as opposed to others is that children and adults alike can enjoy it.  There is no need for cursing or sex or graphic violence for the movie to still be a huge hit at the box office.  It's kind of like Bill Cosby's comedy.  He made the audience laugh without cheapening his performance with vulgarity.  That in my book made him a true comedian just as it makes Shrek and its sequel a truly enjoyable movie.  I won't spoil you with the plot progression of Shrek 2.  I am so confident that you will like it, that you should just go out and watch it to find out for yourself.  Expect all of the great CG animation that you saw in the first, all the great characters (save that of the dragon and Farquuad), and all the great comedy.  And this one's definitely a keeper for anyone's movie collection.",9,0,0,26 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Quentin Strikes Bizarre Again
","Spoiler!!! Quentin Tarantino does little to surprise the audience with this film, if they have seen some of his other works.  Quentin seems to prefer directing in the past (Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown, etc.) and this film holds the same 70's/80's portrayal.  It also carries the morbidity, violence, sexual situations of Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, Dust Till Dawn, and Pulp Fiction. But what is most striking is his comical matrimony of the Japanese Samurai theme with the likes of Dolemite or Chips with retro themes such as split screen photography.  His tale unfolds in chapters with flashbacks, sometimes in Japanese anime.  The graphic nature of this procession is amplified and lends further humor and almost amateurism in the frequent use of blood-spraying special effects.  Stunts resemble those in The Matrix and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with the overuse of cable effects.If none of the above appears outrageous or excessive then elements of the plot can always be considered.  But Quentin does deserve credit in the basic story idea, where a female assassin wishes to leave the death business, get married, and have a child.  Unfortunately her `contract' is for life and organization she works for decides to assassinate her - at her wedding while she is an expectant mother.  But the assassin-ee/heroine survives and pursues a gruesome journey of vengeance.  To this point, the movie has great potential as a former assassin goes after her murderous comrades.  But Quentin's ever-persistent aim to be `different' and on the edge, leave him incorporating all sorts of bizarre elements from the soundtrack to anime to retro-sitcom themes to Japanese s.f.x. martial arts.  And underlying all this he still tries to maintain a serious theme of some sort of `Way of the Bushido' samurai philosophy as the heroine embarks on her quest for revenge.Even more over-the-top is that the heroine survives being beaten and shot in the head, only to lose her baby and be left in a coma in a hospital.  She then is sold off as a comatose prostitute to be raped by the hospital staff and whatever Johns are brought in. The depressing and horrific nature of all of this is (once again) set as some bipolar/chaotic extreme to other elements of the story, such as intense cursing intermingled with almost prize-winning speech lessons.  What's perhaps worst of all (or not depending on how you were enduring the movie) is that Quentin only takes you a little more than half way in the plot.  That's right, there's no conclusion.  He prefers a sequel to finish this revenge saga.  But given what I saw, I think his movie sales may have had a better shot if his kept the film in entirety. If you like action, this film's got plenty of it, and that is perhaps its redeeming quality.  Just don't expect much else.",Null,0,0,11 April 2004
Big Fish," Fairytale Journey
","This movie is best described as the journey of a man's life with a fairytale portrayal.  It chronicles Edward Bloom's sugar-coated life events that initially made for good stories and later defined his character.  His son wishes to discover 'who' his father really was,  not just some made-up story.  But in the end, it is revealed that sometimes holding on to harmless fantasies in life, like a child's belief in the toothfairy, is not so bad after all.And this movie felt like something out of a children's book, perhaps Gulliver's Travels.  The adventures you are taken on alternate with farcical themes intermingled with semi-serious ones.  And this 'replay' of Edward Bloom's life seems at times better suited for children.  While still enjoyable by adults, it should not be assumed to be too much more than its 'Jack and The Beanstalk' type story.",5,0,2,16 July 2004
Saw," Morbid, Sick, A Good Thriller Movie!
","Well, after I saw the trailer in the theater for this one I was instantly hooked. I mean, how gruesome is a killer who tries to get people to cut their own legs off in order to escape?! I was surprised to see Danny Glover and Cary Elwes in it and their star power further persuaded me to watch 'Saw'.This film isn't just simple horror gore. It is known as a psychological thriller/horror, kind of like Silence of the Lambs or Seven. It has their gore too. Strangers are abducted and put into dire situations (kind of like a lethal contest) where they must play some psycho's (Jigsaw's)sick games that he thinks eradicate evil. There are a couple of weak areas: Glover and Elwes' characters toward the end and shackles with electrodes in them. But mostly this film gives good shock therapy in surprising the audience and in making them repel from the horrors on the screen. The ending...well, that's probably the best and most shocking part. Anyone who spoils it for you probably just gave away the main reason for watching. 8/10",8,0,0,12 November 2004
The Last Samurai," A Dying Honor from the East
","Like that of Braveheart, The Patriot, and Dances with Wolves, The Last Samurai centers around the struggle a minority faces in standing up for its way of life.  The year is 1876 and thanks to Commodore Perry, the island nation of Japan discovers the 'modern' world.  The emperor of the great nation, in an effort to modernize his country and bring about an industrial revolution, brings in western influence. But this influence is comprised of self-interested greedy parties who care nothing for Japan's people.  As a result, the emperor is misguided into disbanding the devout Samurai, who have protected the country for a thousand years.  They are asked to give up their way of life and step aside to western influence so that a new unified militaristic army of Japan may be formed.In charge of the task to train this army is Captain Algren (Tom Cruise).  We discover Algren to be a man suffering from horrible nightmares over his actions against the American indians.  He spends most of his time in the bottle to escape his self-torture and guilt. He agrees to be privately hired for the Japan assignment because he knows nothing else than war and that seems to be what he is fit for.Algren begins training the rudimentary new army of Japan but soon finds himself prematurely ordered to march them into battle against the Samurai. The impending defeat of the untrained soldiers comes as no surprise as the Samurai sweep over them in a furious wave of violence.  But Algren's life is spared by the leader of the Samurai, Katsumoto, whose sees him as a remarkable warrior and the physical manifestation of a vision he encountered.Algren begins to undergo a transformation as he is kept prisoner by the Samurai.  Living with them, he begins to see the tribal people for who they are and respects and admires their honor, kindness, discipline, and perfection as a way of life.  He eventually is welcomed into their confidence and begins training in their ways.When the time arrives for Algren to choose whose side he is going to fight for, whether he is an man of the west or the east, Algren chooses that of the Samurai.  He does so as an act of redemption and because he realizes the importance in defending what you believe.   Despite the enormous odds against the tribal people, the Samurai are excited for the chance to make their stand and embrace their way of life to die with honor.Algren and Katsumoto lead the Samurai into battle to die a glorious death, as all Samurai, save Algren, are defeated by the new army of Japan (hence the title).  The weapons of the old (swords, bows and arrows) are defeated by that of the new (cannons, rifles, machine guns).  And in one of the more dramatic and heartfelt sad endings, we see the bravery and dignity of a simple culture mowed down by the technological cowardice of the complex world.  The question this ending poses is whether it is more honorable or foolhardy to fight for a way of life, even in the face of an imminent and gruesome death.  I will let you decide.",7,1,2,17 May 2004
A Clockwork Orange," Singin' In The Rain!
","Strangely (and scarily) enough the song 'Singin' In th Rain' was temporarily stuck in my head. You'd understand why after watching this film. A Clockwork Orange is an early Stanley Kubrick work and keeps with his bizarre filmatic perspective. In some of the more shocking scenes of violence (even for today much less for 1971) the audience follows the horrid acts of a bunch of hoodlums in a strange fantasy world. The portrayed date of the film is subject to debate, possessing many of the conveniences of today yet a setting that seems altogether remote and distant in time. Irregardless, A Clockwork Orange focuses on one individual in particular, 'Alex' de Large (Malcolm McDowell) and his exploits of society in order to satiate his teenage darkly desires. The film starts off with an almost abandonment or anarchy to life, a take or do-as-you-please philosophy (hedonism in short). We watch as the misguided youth commits all sorts of atrocities at his every whim. He then undergoes a metamorphosis where he is no longer the 'afflictor' but the afflicted. And in perhaps one of more ironic injustices of a comedic sort, Alex becomes a mistaken hero who further continues to exploit society, not with his vices, but this time with his false virtues. Society is the victim of its own system in producing miscreants who later become ill-gotten champions. Quite a disturbing look at things that don't seem too far off the beaten path, even if a bit exaggerated! 7/10",7,1,2,19 November 2004
The Fly," Mutant Creativity At Work
","In the 1950s when all the world was aflame with ideas of the future (Orwell's War of the Worlds, 1984, and Assimov's work), George Langelaan came up with the story, The Fly, as his one-hit wonder.  Now, not having seen the first version with Vincent Price, I cannot comment on whether this one, directed by David Cronenberg, is better.  I can, however, tell you that this film is good.  Although it is a slight departure from Langellan's story in that scientist Seth Brundle's (Jeff Goldblum) whole body becomes mutated with a fly's DNA.  In the original story the head and arm become switched with that of a fly.  The special effects and design work involved are very good, from the telepods to the rapid transformation of Brundle into the fly. The chemistry between reporter Veronica Quaife (Gena Davis) seems a little implausible at first but soon fades out as the possibility of teleportation is discussed.The movie delivers good suspense in Brudle-fly's metamorphosis.  Veronica's pregnancy gives puts a little shock-factor in as well.  The ending has both strange gore along with good theatrical tragedy.  *SPOILERS HEREAFTER:  I was confused as to why the bar girl Brundle picked up didn't get pregnant or was tested (maybe on birth control for flies?).  Some intense gore as Brundle immobilizes his victim when John Getz' arm and foot are melted.  And of course, the disturbing idea that Brundle wants to mutate himself, Veronica and the baby into one big mass...?  Yuck!",7,0,1,22 August 2004
From Hell," A Bizarre View of the Ripper Tale
","The classic 'Jack the Ripper' story has evolved to incorporate clairvoyant inspectors, heavy laudenaum usage, prostitution as prolific as religion, and sacred orders and sects.  This is, in a sense, what this movie is about. 
The serial-killer story is delivered well in London with great  visuals of the times (late 19th century).  And the street life, while horrible, is plausible enough.  But the mysticism that was intended to be created in a psychic inspector's (Johnny Depp) pursuit of the enigmatic 'Ripper' falls short.  The director should have given Depp a 'Sherlock Holmes' role and cut the whole visionary bit out, although Depp did play his role well.  
I won't ruin the biggest part of the movie for you, the 'Who dunnit'.  But I must say while the film does good at keeping you guessing, the discovery appears lame and perhaps far-fetched.  The film then really starts to head south as cult-ish intimations develop and later deadlock into a depressing ending that has nowhere to run but down the tubes. 4/10",5,2,4,27 July 2004
Eyes Wide Shut," Definitely A Sexual Odyssey
","This film was described as a sexual odyssey and that much is true. It's also director Stanley Kubrick's last film (I think I might actually be happy about that). I know countless people have debated what this film really meant and probably over-analyzed it to the point they injected their own creativity into it. My viewpoint is much more practical and simple I think, albeit I still don't know why Stanley was so fascinated by sexuality to choose a final film about it. I got the impression the film was more for effect and remembrance than anything else. Given the it's lack of taste and gratuitousness, I would agree.'Eyes Wide Shut' starts out in unveiling the life of a well-to-do couple. It gives particular attention to Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman) on an emotional and physical level to show a woman in all her sexuality. I think it attempts to show the physical desires a woman has with her maternal nature and her sincere affections. This schism in a woman's feelings is flip-flopped back and forth throughout the film and almost appears as if Kubrick might be showing some satirical misogyny...? Alice quickly becomes an over-the-top bimbo at a social event with her doctor husband, Bill Harford (then, real-life husband Tom Cruise). I think Kubrick thought the display of a real-life couple (especially stars) would not only draw public attention but would also allow for a better film due to the established chemistry. But this was my first disappointment. For two real-life lovers, I felt their encounters were sometimes forced or awkward and unconvincing. Their interaction with the daughter felt very unnatural, especially with Cruise's part. I mentioned misogyny earlier and I'll elaborate. Alice is intoxicated and soon begins flirting with an older man who is trying to seduce her. She acts (as I said) like a complete bimbo. But the encounter serves the purpose of creating a debate between Alice and her husband about attraction and trust. She verbally attacks her husband to try and find some sort infidelity in his at least having sexual thoughts about another person. This brings to the surface Alice's own hidden sexual thoughts she has kept from her husband. She confesses having entertained sexual thoughts about someone other than her husband. She goes on to say that she would have sacrificed everything (husband, marriage, child, etc.) for a one-night stand with a man she saw at a hotel. Bill Harford is portrayed as a real gentleman and very devoted to his wife and child. He is loosely-cohesive after receiving the shocking confessional from his wife. But he still believes women aren't as sexual and willing to do the things men do. Reinforcing the meaning of Alice's confession, a women tells Bill she loves him and wants him. This comes as a shock since he hardly knows her. Her sincerity scares him as it shows how women can have thoughts for other men without giving the slightest intimation. What generates a negative view of women is in the subsequent collapse of Bill's fidelity. His wife's mental cheating acts as the impetus for his own destruction. Man destruction appears to be the fault of a woman's sexual uncontrollability. Alice's confession and the thought of infidelity (on any level) torment Bill into attempting to commit the reality of her thoughts. You could also look at the plot for this film as removing gender from sex and showing both males and females as having the same desires, drives, and secrets. It still shows Bill as a horse put into motion by his wife's secret eroticism. Bill ends up with a whore as a way to get back at his wife and indulge himself. Luckily, he is saved by a phone call which keeps him from making a marital mistake. That's still strike one on the close-call scale. Next he calls the woman's house that confessed her attraction to him. The phone is answered by her boyfriend and Bill hangs up. That's strike two. Bill then ends up going back to see the whore, Domino, but finds out she is not home. After trying to put the moves on her roommate, he is given the news that Domino was diagnosed with AIDS. That's strike three on the close-call scale! Well, you know what they say after three strikes.And out goes Bill (*SPOILERS BELOW*). He still can't stop himself as if on some sexual adventure. He finds out about a private costume party that hosts orgies. This fuels Bill's fire as he gets the secret password (ironically it's Fidelio) and a costume. In probably the most memorable scene of the film, Bill is shown at an occult hedonistic masquerade. An intentionally jarring set of piano keys follow throughout and into the rest of the film - more Kubrick signature bizarrity. Without going into all the details, Bill witnesses some pretty raunchy and shocking things. But just as he's been warned by some mysterious hooker to leave, he is discovered as an interloper. The negative consequences of Bill's departure from fidelity soon become apparent as it appears as if his life might be in jeopardy. His inquiries into the events from the party yield a dead body and a kidnapped friend. The party and its darkness envelope the remainder of the film. Two other scenes show a dark sexual perspective - the costume owner becoming a pimp for his daughter and the revelation of Bill's close friend as one of the orgy's members.All of this appears as the dirty foam of some wave that just crashed on the beach. It is the deluge from a intense storm brought about by sex. In one of the more controversial parts of the film, Bill returns home late after hearing his friend's revelation. He finds the mask from the orgy masquerade on the pillow next to his wife. He lost the mask somehow before returning it the store. Some people have suggested his wife found the mask and put it there. I am more apt to believe, since she did not know of the mask's significance, that someone from the party broke into his house and put it there as a warning. That is why Bill breaks down and confesses everything to his wife.The ending is just as strange as the rest of the film, so I guess it's no surprise. True to his intended depiction of women, Kubrick has Kidman deliver a speech with a surprising sexually-expletive ending. I don't know what Stanley thinks he's accomplished here. And what makes him the authority on women and their sexuality? 'Eyes Wide Shut' was just too creepy and awkwardly 'Basic Instinct' to be very credible. Especially the whole orgy thing, although I doubt I will forget it anytime soon. It scares me that those kind of things probably go on. Some sick insanely-rich people. 4/10",4,0,3,20 December 2004
Mystic River," A Conclusion Full of Bullets
","When a movie geek sees a cast like Kevin Bacon, Lawrence Fishburne, Sean Penn, and Tim Robbins, he/she should probably be delighted in the ensuing acting.  I concur after having watched this film that there was good acting. In some cases excellent acting.  And the story speeds along at a nice clip..........right up to its demise.  The demise of a movie that tells a gripping dramatic tale with the set-up for a perfect twist ending, and it then reveals an unbelievable and empty conclusion.  And with the superstar cast it has, it is portrayed very well.  And I gotta say it's puzzling when a cast like this agrees to do a movie and despite the great job they do, remain stuck in a film with dire consequences of any success because of a lame story ending.  Go fish...?I hate to spoil it for you and just tell you this lame ending (if you haven't see it).  Because as I said earlier, the acting is good.  And....oh well........I'll tell it to you anyway (SPOILER).  A 17 year-old girl is murdered and it turns out a couple of punk kids killed her because they did not want her to tell on them for monkeying around with a gun.  She swerves off to the side of the road to dodge the gun-waving idiot.  The kids then beat her with a hockey stick, chasing her into the nearby woods.  They then find her and shoot her to death.  Nice, huh?  Well the story builds this mystery, making it look like Tim Robbins killed her.  And then three old friends are reunited and flashbacks of a horrible childhood experience for them.  The gangster dad then has his goons hunt for his daughter's killer. And............Can you believe it?...this great cloud of talent, of genuine portrayals, to be stuck with a bunch of farcical punks in a awkward and semi-hysterical urban homicide.  A crying shame and a waste.  Why didn't the director watch more of The Sixth Sense and take some notes?  This movie was perfect for one of those ending.  Such a waste. :-(",3,1,1,14 June 2004
Rosemary's Baby," Don't Believe Them
","I went online some time ago to do a little research on what people thought were the top ten scariest movies. Again and again, Rosemary's Baby kept coming up. Despite its age (1968), I had never seen the film and thought it was some classic horror, like The Exorcist or something. Boy was I wrong. And so was everybody else that said how scary this film was.What I saw in watching Rosemary's Baby was old-school infantile acting, where everyone presents themselves as overly happily or stresses the emotion they are trying to convey to the point it comes off as sappy. While I can't overly slant Mia Farrow for her part in the film (she plays a meek young woman very well), her role as Rosemary had me feeling like she was a complete bimbo. I have seen my share of old films and don't know why but all of the characters do seem too scripted. Maybe we just have better actors today or better script writers (???).What will surprise you and make you think differently about your grandmother and society in the 60's is the use of nudity in this film. There is even one scene (SPOILER) where Rosemary is raped by the Devil and is in bondage while a bunch of old croons stand around as naked voyeurs witnessing some bizarre live sex act. That part was shocking, but certainly not scary. The film is so predictable (maybe Polanski wanted it to be that way) that you begin to second guess yourself. You're thinking that the director has led you down an obvious path just to surprise you somewhere else. But unfortunately, no surprises. The film is quite transparent, except for the ending, which is just bizarrely ridiculous. Qualities of Rosemary's Baby, especially the repetitively eerie lullaby in the beginning and end, had me thinking Stanley Kubrick directed this. 5/10How much more annoying could Mrs. Castevet get!?",5,7,18,29 September 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Good News Station Spoof
","Having worked at a news station before, I could appreciate the humor behind the idea used in this film. It is a spoof of the inner workings at a news station and the characters that bring you the news. The theme used is a bit throwback, with an old-school flavor. Will Ferrel plays Ron Burgundy, a chauvinistic playboy news anchor. When a gorgeous female is introduced to the all-male news cast, all goes awry.Some films are really funny and others are more silly. While 'Anchorman' had some genuinely funny parts to it, it was otherwise mostly silly. Will Ferrell's idea as the writer of this film was good and brings comic relief through a unique perspective, but things begin to get 'Naked Gun' fast and go goofy.I am beginning to think that Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson (Owen's younger brother), and Vince Vaughn have some sort of comedy band going. Lately, these four have interchangeably starred in film's together. It reminds me of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. I can't say I've been wholly impressed by such repetition. I hope Will keeps to himself and continues to give us that 'Saturday Night Live' wackiness he is known for. 5/10P.S.: I still can't believe that was Christina Applegate playing Veronica! Whew, she's still hot!",5,1,2,29 December 2004
The Terminal," Stuck like Chuck
","Can you imagine spending nine months or more stuck in an airport?  I can't stand even walking through them much less living there.  For Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) in The Terminal that is exactly what he has to do - live in an airport.  Due to some international fiasco between his home country and the United States, he cannot be granted a VISA and allowed into the country.  They cannot return him home either due to a rebellion that is going on. Therefore, he is stuck in the limbo land of a catch 22.For something so simple as a story about a guy being stuck in an airport, Steven Spielberg delivers quite a great story.  How bad can a guy's luck get when he is forced to bathe in a public restroom?  Or when his bed is made of a bunch of seats?To make matters worse he falls in love with a flight attendant, Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta Jones) who seems destined to pick the wrong men in her life.  What occurs thereafter is serious of comedic misadventures of a man who tries to occupy himself in an airport as best he can while under the watch of a ruthless airport security overseer (Stanley Tucci).This movie is an upside-down love story, a tragedy, and above all else a comedy.  Aside from an unexpected ending, it delivers a nicely told tale of a simple man's delayed journey to America.",7,0,0,30 June 2004
Blade Runner," A Manufactured Humanity
","For Deckard (Harrison Ford), going after rogue robots is just part of an ordinary day. Robots have been created that simulate humans (replicants) and are used as slave labor. A new class of replicants, the Omega 6, has been created and replicate humans more than anyone can every imagine. When four of them hijack a ship and head for earth to try and extend their ephemeral lives, Deckard is commissioned to 'retire' the rogues.The last time I saw this film was probably twelve years ago or better, so it was pretty hazy. Having watched it just now, it was totally different from what I expected. Ridley Scott (director), rather than create the action flick I expected this to be, instead favored lengthy character development. He did this to show the similarities and marriage between man and the product of his godly labors, the robot. At times this makes the movie seem long and drawn out, but is otherwise necessary to the plot and point of the film. The evolution of the robot mentally to the state of man is excellently depicted in Rutger Hauer's character, Roy, and in Sean Young's character Rachael. They express sadness, anger, love, insanity, kindness, and the innate human quality of self-preservation.I was confused however in the odd relationship between Deckard and Rachael. It was almost as if he were dictating or instructing, like that of a programmer, a piece of equipment to respond to his amorous advances. This didn't feel quite right in the film even though I am aware Rachael's conscious mind was new to feelings of love or affection.Also Rutger Hauer's Roy was just a little too outlandish despite being motivated by his desperate attempts at survival. (SPOILER)He is brutally violent and repulsive in killing two humans and then ironically shows Deckard mercy and kindness. I guess this just epitomizes being irrational with no logical thought progression.All in all, this was a good sci-fi movie from another one of Philip K. Dick's novels. If you want to see a 'today's version' of this film you should watch 'Screamers', also written by Philip K. Dick. It details the evolution of the battle of man versus machine, but like this movie, has a surprising twist at the end. 7/10",7,2,4,5 August 2004
Identity," Incredible, Except for the Ending!
","I have seen few films that give you are real Sixth Sense type of shock in them. It's probably because few directors are capable of manufacturing them. Then again, maybe there aren't enough good scripts. Whatever the reason, James Mangold does an excellent job with 'Identity'. The cast alone is stellar! You have Ray Liotta, John Cusack, Amanda Peet (great in 'The Whole Nine Yards'), Alfred Molina (Spiderman 2), Clea Du Vall, Rebecca De Mornay (quite a surprise), and a few other familiar faces. All of these stars are cast into a motley bunch of characters that are held up in a local motel due to a rainstorm. The introductory scenes are cleverly tied together in a sequence of demonstrations of how one thing leads to another. The final destination for all of these encounters is the motel, which seems to resemble an island in the middle of nowhere. I can't tell you much more of this film without ruining it. I can say that a convict arrives in the custody of an officer. He escapes and one of the hotel guests ends up dead. Murder continues as another and yet another of the group is killed.The redeeming quality of this film and the main reason to watch it is in its portrayal of everything appearing as what it is, yet being something entirely different. The ending, what adding another shock, was too far-fetched for me. I felt the movie could have actually ended at an earlier point, but it would have changed the entire overall mood. Watch it and judge for yourself! 8/10",8,2,5,11 December 2004
Final Destination," Can you cheat death?
","When seven passengers step off a plane just before it explodes, you can imagine they drew a little attention.  It turns out these seven individuals just cheated death.  One teen boy with a gift for seeing the Grim Reaper's plans becomes hysterical when seeing his own death and his schizo-behavior ends up getting six other passengers booted off the flight.  Little did they know how big a favor he did them.But shortly thereafter these survivors start to turn up dead.  It appears that Death wants his victims after all, no 'Pass Go, Collect $200'.  The final four (no pun intended) scramble around trying to avoid death and figure out his 'design' for them.  They end up playing a lethal game of cat-and-mouse - trying to escape their demise by saving one another so that Death may pass them and go on to the next victim.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," I'm exhausted!
","Whew!  Gotta catch my breath before I start this writeup!  ......Okay, I'm alright now.  Sorry, but I just watched Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and I feel as if I just ran 50 miles (whatever that feels like). Anyway, I'm tired man!  This movie is a Die-Hardest film, where no matter how fast it goes or beaten up it gets, it just doesn't die.  You think it's just about whipped and done for, but it keeps on going.  If you've seen the movie A.I. you know exactly what I'm talking about.  You think the movie is going to end or has ended (and rightfully you should), it instead goes on another round or two.  The intermission which they cruelly deprive us from in these marathon movies is removed as your mind takes on an endurance contest with a visual barrage of elements and then a ride on a turbo-charged merry-go-round.  All of this to expel each....fading......breath....with.......another...............ending.",5,3,7,14 June 2004
The Replacements," The Redeemers
","For a bunch of wash-outs in the game of football, a second chance at living their dreams just seems too unreal.  But an NFL football coach for the Sentinels, Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman), gives them that chance.An odd cast of players comprising Keanu Reeves, Orlando Jones, Jon Favreau, and others 'replaces' a bunch of spoiled rich football stars who are demanding more money.  The result is the struggle of group of talented has-been guys whose personal conflicts are the only thing that keep them from being winners.  The chance to be on a NFL football team is their last chance to redeem themselves and their dreams.This film not only has great acting but also good football, and an incredible cheerleading team (for you guys).  In the end reminds us of the glory of the game and the victory that comes with achievement.  It is the stuff that stories are told about for years to come.  My vote 8/10.",8,0,1,16 July 2004
The Breakfast Club," Who Would've Thought...
","There have been countless great stories told over time, so much so it's a wonder where directors get original ideas anymore. If someone told me now (much less back in 1985) that making a movie about five teenagers spending a Saturday in detention was going to top the charts, I wouldn't have believed them. But I'd be wrong, as that is exactly what 'The Breakfast Club' did/does. This film leaves an immortal quality with it because it's so archetypal or universal. It shows use the insides of a group of teenagers who might, on the surface, appear totally different from one another but realize they are more alike than they ever could imagine. The brilliance in the film is in introducing five characters together, watching the hostilities/personas flare, and then seeing the stereotypes fade away as the 'delinquents' begin to bond. All of this transpires during an era (the 80's) that seemed to leave its own legacy, producing 'The Breakfast Club' in its wake. And childhood stars back then went on to become greater things: Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall (reminds me of my brother), and Ally Sheedy. Obviously, much of this cast needs no introduction and in seeing 'The Breakfast Club' it's obvious how talented they were, especially Ringwald and Hall who were 17 at the time. It's sort of strange how in most films or television series they use older actors to play younger roles. Seeing Judd Nelson stomp around and act like a seventeen or eighteen old when he was really twenty-six at the time is hilarious in retrospect. It's makes Ringwald and Hall's performances all the more miraculous in being able to deliver the goods at such a young age (but then again maybe they were just acting like themselves at the time).I really can't give any part of the movie away to readers. But my belabored emphasis is because it's so good. It takes everything that makes a teenager a teenager (all the pastimes, rights of passage, peer pressure, and acting cool) and bottles it all up and shakes it around. Out come the pieces of five individuals who spend the day together and realize more about life (and themselves) than probably most people do. 9/10!",9,0,1,3 November 2004
