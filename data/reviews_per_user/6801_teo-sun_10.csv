The Avengers," A Masterpiece for every comics fan in the world...
","First thing first: 'The Avengers' is a masterpiece. Period. It's not easy to put together the most famous Marvel superheroes (apart from Spidey, of course!)in a single movie with a good plot, very good characters development (good & evil), and make a great movie like this one. The story develops around the 'Avengers' project, an idea by Nick Fury (director of S.H.I.E.L.D.) and the superhero-billionaire Tony Stark alias Iron Man. A group of Super-persons at service of mankind (something like the X-Men..). The villain here is Loki, returned from the end of the other great movie from Marvel Studios 'Thor', eager to take control of the earth using the powers of the Tesseract, the same powerful alien artifact seen in 'Captain America'. There is a connection with other Marvel movies, in fact to really appreciate the movie you should see the other two movies at least, but it's not a priority of course. The result is a movie full of wonderful action sequences, smart dialogs, excellent character development and an open finale for another, possible, great adventure (don't worry, no spoilers here, just wait the end of the first part of the credits at the end of the movie..). A pleasant surprise, a wonderful movie for every comic fan around the world, and for the ones that hates this kind of movie: just see this film and you'll be amazed. Trust me. 10/10 Teo from Italy",10,2,6,2 May 2012
Fight Club," This is your life and it's ending one minute at time. A MASTERPIECE!
","This is an incredible movie. I've seen 'fight club' when it was released in 1999; stunned by that movie i read the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, and i've discovered an incredible writer too. It's too complicated to describe a movie like this. It's a crude, realistic, nihilistic vision of our lives, our crisis, our world filled with clich√©s, with media that tell you how you must be, how you must act, how you must live. It's not only a fighting movie at all. It's about deconstructions, about pain, about the use of a struggle to feel human again. The acting from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are great here. Both seems to dive like a fish in their roles, and the character of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is simply flawless. From beginning to the end the movie caught you in an alienated, but incredibly real web of a twisted mind, struggling for freedom, raging against everything. I can't tell anything more 'cause i'll ruin the atmosphere of the flick... The novel it's great too (like all others works by Chuck). The movie is almost identical to the book, apart for the end. In conclusion i consider 'Fight Club' one of the deepest, darkest and twisting movie of the decade. It's a masterpiece and you must see it at least once, and if you think i must have my head examined, well, you've totally missed the point!!! You wont be disappointed, i can assure you that!!! 10/10",10,3,8,22 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Spectacular movie! A great sea-tale, a great sequel.
","I don't understand all the negative comments i've read! This movie is AWESOME! If you liked the first movie 'the Curse of the Black Pearl' you'll definitely enjoy this spectacular sequel; if you haven't seen yet the first movie DO NOT WATCH this second! You'll understand nothing about the story of Jack Sparrow and the other characters. The acting is perfect, especially Johnny Depp is simply great acting in the role of the pirate Jack Sparrow. He's already one icon, a perfect character developed by himself, and he's truly great! The special effects are huge as always, and i liked the octopus-beard of Davy Jones and the sea-damned crew. The music, the pace of the movie and the story developed over the first movie, these are all pieces of the same machine that make 'Pirates of the Caribbean' a marvelous saga for everyone. Remember that this is the second chapter of a trilogy, a trilogy filled with pirate magic, a trilogy that will become famous as the 'Lord of the rings' trilogy. Those who don't appreciate this 'piratesque' thrill-ride don't understand the magic of those wonderful movies. Period.",10,2,5,22 September 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Harrr...This flick delivered shivers down my salty spine!!!
","Ahoi there!!! 'Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl' is one of the most funny, exiting, action-filled, spectacular masterpiece of this genre! One thing over all: Johnny Depp! He is simply fantastic acting as the pirate Jack Sparrow. I consider him one of the best actors of all times because he is always perfect in almost every role (thanks to Tim Burton that discovered him!). Jack Sparrow is incredible, funny and strange, the perfect buccaneer for a movie like that. Good performance from Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley too. The photography, the sets, are perfect, and you can feel all the 'salty' feeling of the Caribbeans in the whole movie. The story is good: a good mix of adventure and mystery, filled with action, explosions, and naval battles. The extra contents on the DVD shows how they have bought to life all that magic! The soundtrack is epic and it fit perfectly in the movie, thanks to Klaus Badelt, a real artist. In conclusion, this is an adventure masterpiece, incredibly entertaining for everyone who have a little pirate-child inside! HARRR..... where's my bottle of rum???",10,2,5,9 March 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Fun, Fun, Fuuuun!!! :D
","This is truly one of the best computer graphic movie! It's funny, VERY funny! The gags here are even better than the ones in the first Shrek! All the characters are very well developed and in this second chapter, since we're all supposed to already know Diego, Manny and Sid, the movie tends to be more funny, focusing on the incredible situations of the incoming meltdown, and the great escape from the tsunami. We'll find again the prehistoric squirrel Scrat, that is now the copy of the famous Wile E. Coyote! You'll laugh your jaw off here, 'cause if the Coyote was funny trying to catch the Road Runner, Scrat is even more funny trying to grab his food!!! And he's going to be a real hero in this second episode...!! In conclusion this is a great movie, not only for children. Good time, good laughs! What else? :)",10,1,1,26 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Incredible finale for an incredible saga!!!
","In this third installment Verbinski surpassed itself with an outstanding, colorful, exiting movie! Here we encounter all the characters we've met before in the 2 previous movies, and all of them have an important part in the solution of the great conflict between pirates/england forces/Davy Jones. The result is a truly enjoyable movie that delivers almost 3 hours of pure entertainment without a single slow moment. The acting is perfect, Johnny Depp the best as always as Captain Jack Sparrow, but also outstanding the performance of Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa, returned from the land of the dead to aid the pirate cause, bravo to Orlando Bloom, and here we have a better performance by Keira Knightley. The photography, the sound, the incredible music by a great Hans Zimmer, everything creates that kind of 'swashbuckler magic' that only these movies have delivered in the Hollywood story so far. What else can I say? You MUST join this incredible trip to the End of the World and return!!! 10/10",10,4,8,5 June 2007
Crash," One of the best movies i've seen...
","I saw this movie last night after the Oscar Ceremony. I've seen the ceremony live on TV here in Ialy and i was eager to see the 'Best Movie of the Year'. Well, 'Crash' is surprisingly good, a masterpiece about human feelings, and we all know how human feelings are ignored in these days. There's a good and an evil side in every one of us and sometimes it's necessary to 'crash' into something to see who we really are. The cast is great, there's not a leading role in anyone of the actors, but everyone does his job in a perfect way. In the movie we can see different people, living different lives, and then they'll come 'crash' together in a melting pot of situations, guilty and redemption, racism and love, but in the end everyone must fight his own demons.In conclusion, this is really a great movie, everyone must see that and enjoy this rare example of fine cinematography.",10,6,14,8 March 2006
Gone Baby Gone," The real dark of a soul lies beneath the surface.
","This is the first movie that shows the art of direction of an ex-blockbuster actor like Ben Affleck, and, i must say, i'm really impressed. Based on another stunning novel by American author Dennis Lehane, 'Gone Baby Gone' is a cold,sad,moving and unpredictable masterpiece in his genre. Affleck stars his brother Casey in the role of a young private investigator chasing the kidnappers of a little girl, daughter of a drug addict. The movie unfold slowly on the dark side. The cast is perfect and the direction of Ben can show us the multiple faces of Boston, of his people, with the voice of Casey that explain us, like a guide to tourists, how people lives, how people struggle in his neighborhood, without hope, without color, in a twilight-zone existence, and the truth is far from easy... A movie that rise from the others of his genre because has the ability to move different ideas, deep thoughts in the finale. It's not easy to direct a movie like that, it's not easy to use a topic so delicate yet so dark like kidnappings, but here Affleck shows that he can truly amaze us, so that we can breathe the real atmosphere of a plastic reality where the real life, the real problems, the real dark lies beneath our smiling faces.Go see it if you haven't yet. This is a must see. My word. A+++",9,2,3,26 November 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Poetry moving backwards...
","I really don't understand all the critics attacking this gem of modern cinematography accusing this movie to be too abstract, too unusual, too unrealistic to be intense, moving, beautiful. Who said that cinema is all about telling true stories, about true events or true characters? We have emotions inside, and, as humans, we need to have our emotions, our feelings, touched by a movie that sometimes makes us think about things greater than us, like life, like all the tiny passing moments of pure joy, like the people we love, like the people we loose during a lifetime. This, and much, much more is 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'. There is so much stuff, so much content beneath the surface of this wonderful adult tale.The direction of David Fincher is absolutely amazing. We've got already a demonstration of his talents with perfect movies like 'Fight Club', or his underrated vision of 'Alien 3', the research of perfection, the colors always gray-shaded, the perfect photography of the scenes. This movie is no exceptions: it's perfect. All the scenes in all the sceneries (from old New Orleans, to Russia, passing through a moving set in the ocean).The special effects are incredible: u can't tell where there's CGI here and where there's only an incredible makeup work to transform Brad Pitt in an old man then in a teenager, or the makeup work on Cate Blanchett (acting beautifully in her role).The movie is long, yes, but it's about 3 hours of poetry, an hymn to life and to people we love,and about the short, but intense,pure moment of life. All moving backwards, like the clock at the train station at the beginning of the movie. Poetry moving backwards.All this magic is decorated with a beautiful soundtrack performed by Alexandre Desplat.In conclusion, 'Benjamin Button' wants to tell us a story: a story about life seen with the eyes of a man aging backwards, of an almost impossible love, and a story about the endless, infinite, cycle of life.It's impossible to not appreciate such ambitious, yet strange movie. It's impossible to remain cold at the end of this intense, magic voyage through time. It's a movie everybody must see, because everybody must see life through the eyes of Benjamin Butt once...at least...10/10",10,2,4,14 February 2009
Iron Man," A Masterpiece in the Cine-Comics genre
","Amazing! This is the right word for this movie. I'm a fan of the Marvel Comics, but i've never read the Iron Man comics, and i must admit that this movie grabs the real spirit of these splendid comics and lets you fly high with the man in the iron armor! I could compare this movie with the Spiderman trilogy, especially the second,that in my advise, was the best of the series.The actors are quite well integrated in the plot. Robert Downey JR is perfect in the role of Tony Stark, great performances also from the others.The special effects are great,and the action sequences are quite well realized.In conclusion, another great movie in the superhero universe.Please, make more movie like this!",10,1,3,23 May 2008
