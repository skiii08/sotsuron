Raiders of the Lost Ark," A recipe for excitement
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is a stunning masterpiece.  It combines all the best elements of an adventure movie and sticks them all together to create a rollercoaster ride of a film.  Hunting for religious artifacts and witnessing their powers?  An incredibly original and INTERESTING idea! Steven Spielberg's swift direction combined with excellent special effects, original and interesting story, good acting, and an incredible musical theme is a recipe for excitement.  From the giant rolling ball at the beginning to the most thrilling climax to a movie ever produced, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a classic and will always remain so a classic. 10/10",10,0,0,26 October 1998
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Impressive
","The Last Crusade is an adventure film that will always remain a sign of the good ol' days. ( AKA not the 90's )  It is a great film, although a bit along the same lines as Raiders ( with a guy 'melting' and all as the climax ) it is nonetheless exciting.  Sean Connery is great as Henry Jones, and he's hialrious too.  True, there is a lot of humour in this film, which can sometimes detract from the excitement, but the overall effect is fun and thrills.  Though not as impressively executed as Raiders, with some effects that are actually worse, the film is still a perfect demonstration of Spielberg's direction (e.g. the shadow turning on the blimp signalling to Indy that the blimp is heading back for Germany ).  Overall, a reliable choice that deserves a place in your video library beside Raiders. 9/10",9,2,3,26 October 1998
