The Ring," Not a bad version, but had one GLARING error.
","Not a bad version, a bit heavy on the special effects. The effects aren't needed if the story is told right. Most viewers are intelligent...we want the mess with your head scary stuff, not the someone/thing jumps out and says 'boo' scary. It was well acted and the gray/blue color of the film really gave it a gritty depressed feeling. Not horrid, but not as good as the original.SPOILER: Rachel should not have been knocked into the well! If the curse was lifted from her (by having her x watch a copy of the tape) then the TV wouldn't have come after her at all. I suppose they just had to add in some more 'boo' scary stuff. In the original the 'Rachel' character willingly goes into the well to find Sadako's (Samara's) body.",Null,0,1,1 April 2003
