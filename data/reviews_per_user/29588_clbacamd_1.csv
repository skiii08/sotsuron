Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This movie is awesome i don't know people hate it so much
",i loved this movie the acting wasn't all that great but it was so funny. i loved how it really talks about how America is.people hate it because it might have made fun of them.there the people that get offended when something makes fun of another person.besides the jokes in this movie were so funny that i laughed through the whole movie yeah the jokes were bad but it its just a movie. people don't need to freak out about a Jew joke there are many other movies that make fun of people but you still like it.this movie was great and funny.its not a good movie for a 7 year old thats way its rated R besidesdont people like dirty jokes i hear then every day.i guess those people are the people in PETA that hate every thing that has to do with something funny or a little mean.,10,18,29,25 September 2007
