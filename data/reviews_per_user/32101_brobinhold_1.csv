Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why the kid?
","Talk about a disappointment.  First time I saw it I wasn't in a good mood, wasn't sure if it was me or the movie that sucked.  So I went AGAIN, and indeed, the movie sucked.  Grew up on the first three, then they go and make this crap.  Hopefully with the next ones they'll consider the backlash of public opinion, they'll use the lovely and talented (forgot her name) well, and they'll chuck the kidstuff.",3,0,1,13 August 2001
