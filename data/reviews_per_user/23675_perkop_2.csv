Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars fans avoid the new series!
","The new series of movies are as if the they are not made by the same person. Actually, in a way, they aren't. They where made by an aging fart who decided to make a kids movie. If you believe that a grate kids movie will be grate for adults then I'll tell you that this isn't one of those. The movie (whole quasi-star wars prequel trilogy) lacks the mysticism of the original series. Thats the main problem. In the original trilogy you had knights, wizards, spiritual power and a princess. In the new series you only have a princess and wannabe knights and wizards with some kind of organism living in them which gives them the force (what????). Where is that Lucas from the 70's gone? The one that wrote about people with unexplainable powers, a force flowing through them that is in all living things. A concept heavily borrowed from the eastern philosophies which gave the films spiritual and mystical note. If you liked the original trilogy for those reasons then avoid the new films at all costs. They are childish crap.",1,5,10,8 June 2008
The Untouchables," Goody-two-shoes
","It's very simple - if you like goody-two-shoes films and you're not into anything remotely complex you'll find this one excellent. It's all black and white here with no Grey areas. I would say its very 'simple' not wanting to use dumb. It has an uncompromisable good guy called Elliot Ness (played by very irritating all American good guy Kevin Costner) chasing a bad guy called Al Capone. There's no real life characters, ones of discussable moral qualities, there's so much fictitious moral in the good characters that you'll wish the ending was different and they where all put up against a wall and Al Capone or Frank Nitti shot the s**t out of them, especially Ness. Mind you, generally I'm not the type to boo at the good guy but this movie is so fake you just can't help but feel really really disappointed at the end when you see that Ness doesn't get his brain blown. To sum up - you know De Palma, you know Costner and thats what you have to expect. Forget about De Niro and Conory, I say its a shame they showed their faces in this crap.",2,13,28,19 September 2005
