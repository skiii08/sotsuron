The Ring," Some points better than the original, but not as good...
","Some details are interesting in this version: The corpse in decomposition; The journalist has more contact with the evil girl; Some scenes about the life of the evil girl; but this is shown in the movie RINGU 0 - birthday.Why japanese is better? It is not so explicative The tape is scarier and looks like a real tape in VHS ( in the american version seems to be done in pelicula) It is understandable (you do not know many in the american version) without being so obvious.Interesting curiosity- This movie is the movie that have more remakes, and also TV -series, There are 2 TV-series 95-97, Ringu 98, Ringu 2 98, Ringu 0 2000, Ringu Virus (Korean version) and this version. And it happened in only 7 years! What coincidence. about the 7 days... I will do my own brazilian version.",9,0,0,12 January 2003
