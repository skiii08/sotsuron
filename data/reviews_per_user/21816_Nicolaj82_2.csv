The Avengers," Almost too short
","Just saw the movie, and i've gotta say it was pretty sweet.Know the feeling when watching a regular 1Â½ hour movie, and halfway through you look at the time in the hopes it's almost over? This was really nicely paced, your attention is on the screen the entire movie, and at no point during did i think about time. When the movie was over, i was like, did 2.20 hours just pass.I didn't expect much humour in this, i knew Stark would be a smart-ass, so that was anticipated, but i did not expect The Hulk to be funny, twice!All in all, great movie, and a good start to The Avengers trilogy/quadrilogy or whatever this is going to become.",9,4,7,21 August 2012
Kick-Ass," Pure awesomeness
","The short version. I really enjoyed this movie, it was much better than expected, and just watching that little girl slay one bad guy after the other is just soo satisfying, every dads dream girl.I'm glad i watched this, from viewing the trailers i thought it had a teen comedy kinda stench over it, and i hate those, but damn i was wrong.The action scenes are really well made, the choreography is superb in my opinion, the comedy is funny and the story is good, it's absolutely one of the better superhero movies i've seen and i would recommend to every one, it's a thrill ride and you don't want it to stop.",10,3,12,8 May 2010
