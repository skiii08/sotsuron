The Expendables 2," Body Count is back
","Alright, so skipping over the slight plot irony that after wasting hundreds and hundreds of ethnic Asians they lose one of their own and then have to pursue the perpetrator for vengeance it's the exploding head sniper thing in the opening sequence that takes the humour in this movie to the next level. With an action hero line up like this it is impossible not to enjoy this movie despite its facile plot, jerky continuity and breathtaking offensiveness. Old action heroes don't die, they just need four hours in makeup, muscle suits, shaping underwear and plenty of body doubles to do their stunts and action scenes. Jet Li and Jason Stratham are both still young enough to actually act their parts, but there's one upper body profile shot of Stallone that probably should have been cut from the movie, it is neither for the fainthearted nor the young. It is almost as if you are watching the final twitching of the newly dead corpse of the war action genre, but the greatest tragedy of this movie is that it still finds an audience, albeit an old one.",3,8,16,22 August 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," bizarre concept but what the heck....
","The attraction of Vampire (and zombie) movies to the movie maker is that they legitimise as much wanton bloodletting and gore as can be served up inside of 120 minutes. 'Body count' movies became politically unacceptable after 9.11 and this became the favoured Hollywood solution. On that score this movie will not disappoint. The extreme violence and CGI blood spatter will not disappoint those with the appetite for gore. A cast of complete unknowns must have been necessitated by the refusal of any known actor, however minor, to participate in such a mess of blood and guts and the greatest disservice imaginable to one of America's greatest presidents. They are all well cast and acquit themselves with whatever dignity is available to such bottom feeders. The ultimate irony would be if every other (historically accurate) record of Abraham Lincoln got lost in the mists of time except this movie and 2,000 years from now our ancestors believed that the American Civil War eradicated not just legalised slavery but also vampires. That would be funny and make it altogether worthwhile.",2,2,4,31 December 2012
Passengers," Potential energy, but failed to deliver.
","I was really looking forward to this movie and the build up to the first half was great, but it turned into such a weak, banal disappointment that it was a shame really. It's great to have a movie with an original plot, which this one kind of was, I know we had interstellar, I know we had Martian but they were different and this was unique in its own way, which was great. Both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence did well. Although Lawrence lacked the earthy, genuine warmth that you sense she was trying to portray in certain scenes. I don't know why she missed that - she's great at everything else, whereas Pratt never misses his mark. Sheen and Fishburn never disappoint either, although Sheen's character as instrumental to the plot as he is, is just illogical and Fishburn's character seems to have been added as a stop gap to block all the leaking holes which are oozing logic and reason. So it really barely holds together. The denouement becomes tediously predictable and the conclusion relies on a weak narrative which is not supported in anyway by the closing scenes... It was OK and I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy it, but you're never going to want to watch it again. Having said that, some of the special effects were great, well thought out and executed and they manage to convey some awe and wonder - but I just think with a little more thought it could have been so much better...",6,0,2,31 December 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Welcome to the dark and dismal world of JK Rowling with added saccharin
","Where children get threatened, beaten and betrayed by sadistic adults until they turn to the dark side... and then they get killed, utterly destroyed. Goodnight kids, sleep well - don't let the images of the poverty stricken, 1920's white trash children's' suffering and hardship spoil your sleep, it's only a JK Rowling story. As charming as the Harry Potter franchise was, despite its very dark side, the franchise has run out of originality, it's just really more and more of the same. If that weren't bad enough - is it just me or why were the only two black faces in the movie the most insidious characters? The friendly executioner woman - 'Don't you want to join it dear?' - who was without compunction or mercy going to put Tina to death. Did she really have to be black? What did that add to a movie made up of otherwise a sea of white faces? And the weak, yet arrogant and inhumane president? Why did she have to be black? (Did she remind you of anybody?) All movie casting decisions are made in full consciousness - they have to be - so you see this kind of covert, yet blatant institutional racism - and I'm a white Caucasian - I have to ask myself would I want my kids to watch a movie like this? No. And not just for those reasons, the movie oscillates between these nightmarish child torturing scenes and saccharin sweet, aspartame sickening CGI fairy tale animal goo and severely unrequited love. I wouldn't want to be a woman in JK Rowling's world. There is no subtlety, no intelligence required, just the wild, swinging, telegraphed punches of an exhausted boxer, flailing around the ring before his final collapse. That aside, in the Caucasian casting department - Colin Farrell made an awesome, malevolent, bully of a baddie, Eddie Redmayne was OK as an upper class autistic English public schoolboy twit - but Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol and last but not least Dan Foglar's excellent performances lifted this over extended, children's fantasy dirge into something almost worth watching. Sadly though, as with the Harry Potter franchise, devoid of moral imperative. OK but I think young people deserve better.",5,4,8,23 November 2016
American Made," America is the worst country in the world
","For a moment I thought we might be in for some biting political commentary, like Brad Pitt's 'War Machine' which delivered exactly that with a real healthy does of realism which I was hoping it might be a new trend from Hollywood but no, sadly it was the opposite of that. The moral imperative appears to be that it's OK to break any law you want if 1) it makes you rich and 2) especially if you're doing it for the 'Merican military. We just love money, you benefit, your family benefits (always good, you can do ANYTHING for your family in Hollywood) and in this case, the local community benefits as well, especially the banks. And that's all that matters. There is no admission that the social consequences of these crimes are really, really odious and those agencies that Merica does have that are suppose to enforce 'law and order' are easily overridden for the sake of political expediency. Justice is clearly defeated. Those agencies are also portrayed as 'stuffed shirt', the well dressed female prosecutor spends time adjusting her skirt before she speaks... It might have been a very different movie if Ron Howard had directed it, but alas, he didn't. So instead of taking the opportunity to highlight US government corruption (which continues unabated today - see War Machine) - we celebrate self interest and invoke rock music, 'caddies' and some good old fashioned Southern slime. We are left with the impression that it's only those foreign agent drug cartels that are bad. They spoilt everything, except the ending. They couldn't do anything about the ending other than take the blame for it. How convenient. Having said that, obviously I was expecting too much of Cruise, but he does deliver a great performance, youthful, energetic, ebullient, just what the role needed. Gleeson too, passes himself off as young, relatively inexperienced operative learning to negotiate the waves of success and failure at the CIA - but at least the movie, however fleetingly, did expose the wholesale brutality and coercion that the CIA really does inflict on people to make them follow orders, without which they would have no 'ASSETS'...",6,4,11,16 October 2017
Wonder Woman," Why does DC suck and Marvel rock? I just don't get it...
","First off, I no longer believe in the 'ratings' that IMDb have - there is no way this movie got rated as an 8.1 - no way. It was rubbish. The only redeeming feature was Chris Pine - who is a class act - but even he couldn't save this. It was too badly written, badly directed and badly executed. Gal Gadot is just awful, wooden, with that thick, ugly Israeli accent - that's not Greek, that's Israeli and we all know why she's there. Catapulted into 'stardom' by Hollywood's racial supremacy agenda, not unlike Amy Tumer and Sarah Silverman. Gal has no presence, little talent, she's not physical, despite the hype, she's pedestrian. Compare this to Sofia Boutella's performance as Ahmanet in The Mummy - where she goes from seductress to evil rage monster seamlessly and where, during her escape she climbs her chains upside down to free herself, there's no CGI, no stunt woman, she actually does it herself. It makes the scene electrifying. But, back to this mediocrity, the plot trivialises history, they do keep a final 'surprise' until the end, but it's hardly exciting, coming so late in the movie you know it's not going to amount to much. The other supporting roles are just weak and underdeveloped, even as baddies, it comes from the 'spell it out to the morons' school of directing. No subtly, no perception, just formulaic writing aiming at an imagined target audience. The ONLY DC franchise I have seen that rocks is the Lego Batman Movie - that was awesome - an unrelenting joy ride of humour and fun - with a moral imperative for kids and lots of dark adult humour that goes right over the kids' heads. In this movie they should have paid more attention to the making of the movie rather than the packaging... But the DC franchise just never seems to learn. Mind you the DC Comics were always lacklustre.",2,6,17,16 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," How does Superman shave?
","He's invulnerable and indestructible, right? So how does he shave? I wouldn't have to ask other than he does appear in one scene with stubble but is clean-shaven throughout the rest of the movie. I'm thinking kryptonite razor blades? Anyway, there were other confusing issues with the movie, some of the early scene changes were very badly strung together with little bridging explanation. That said, Jesse Eisenberg did a sterling job of personifying a psychotic baddie although the you got the impression that he was pretty much running on empty, principally because of lack of direction and content. Otherwise Afflick and the other main characters were well cast and put in solid performances, but Gal Gadot seemed a curious piece of casting. OK she's a looker, albeit with a very low brow, so put her in a $8,000 dress and stand her in anATM line and she looks good. I'd look good standing in an ATM line wearing $8,000 worth of clothes and I'm an ugly, balding, 65 year old man. Mercifully though her actual speaking lines were kept to an absolute minimum, because she cannot act. To call her wooden would be an insult to trees. I think they wanted to hide her ugly foreign accent as well. I can only assume that she was a political appointee, designed to further the Jewish military agenda in Hollywood. For example, Batman's parent's killer, who was replayed several times throughout the movie, looked distinctly and I think unnecessarily, Arabic just to encourage Islamaphobia. Batman's new moral code doesn't prevent him killing people (even if they are baddies) in order to steal any item he wants for his own purposes. It also doesn't prevent him attempting to kill people for no other reason than he thinks they might be a threat. Are those ideas that we want to popularise through the media of mass entertainment? Or is this the self justification of a beleaguered, brutal, military dictatorship? DC comics always lacked the colour and vibrancy of Marvel comics and in the early '60s used to read almost like a party political broadcast for the Republican Party. Superman was white, (despite being an alien) he was brought up on a small farm in Kansas by poor, God fearing Christian simpletons that taught him to fight for truth and justice. Batman was white and rich, he inherited wealth and drove fast cars and loved gadgets but at least he didn't go around killing people to get what he wanted. So is this movie more representative of modern day Republican Party values where It is alright to kill people, especially if they are Arabs? But the best part of the whole movie for me was Batman hitting Superman over the head with a bathroom sink, that was truly awesome. That made up for all the other failings. I think when a movie has political undertones in it and a politically cast foreign national actress and when the agenda is so obvious, that it is never going to be great. This isn't entertainment, this is the coarsest propaganda and it doesn't work for me, not at any level.",4,3,10,9 April 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," Hollywood remakes Raid 2 and calls it its own
","I know this has polled (somehow) 8.3 on the IMDb Richter scale but I don't believe it. I also don't believe the amazingly positive review that's on the lead page, from Johhny Someone in Indonesia. I think that's industry hype. Where's the plot? This is a mashup of the Davinci Code, Raid 2 and Enter the Dragon - Markers? What markers? Where did they come from without explanation? OK, so in the first movie they kill his dog and fair enough, he gets upset and takes them all out, but this? He does a job he doesn't want to do because of the 'markers' - whatever and then they double cross him? What's the point of some stupid 'honour' system if it can be so easily countermanded? The point is to justify the excessive violence of the action scenes - and leave you with a cliffhanger just in case they think they can milk a third instalment out of the franchise. How many brains do you need to blow out in an action scene? Then I phone the special 'contract killers agency' with all the old fashioned secretaries doing the admin and then send text messages to all their handy agents. What a lot of contract killers New York has sitting around on the streets waiting for work and our wounded and somewhat tired hero suddenly is transported from Rome to New York and wanders around taking hits from all sides and yet still manages to take out all his assailants. It's not an action movie, it's a body count movie. Do we think for one minute that our hero is going to fail after seeing how many times his magic underwear protects him in Rome? This is the most ludicrous drivel that I have ever seen. It reminds me of that rubbish Salt when the super powered, anorexic, Angelina Jolie goes throughout the movie performing acts of the most incredible physical endurance which is exactly what anorexics are known for... Now let's talk about Keannu's acting or rather lack of it. Wooden would be an injustice to trees. You might think Ben Afflik is a bad actor but Keannu manages to make John Wayne look versatile, his weird, stilted delivery is apparently deliberate, but to what end? You can throw a million Lawrence Fishburns at a movie like this but you are not going to save it. So no humour, no suspense, just a whole load of set pieces that barely hang together, no character development, no nothing. You can see traces of the set pieces from the first Avengers movie as well. Some nice cinematography, congratulations to the art department, nice white, back lit subways, nice white and blue set pieces, nice classical music (like the first Avengers) to set the scene. Written and directed by men with the mental and emotional age of nine this movie will sink into the abyss and end up on the slag heap of movie history right next to Salt - where it justly belongs.",1,18,37,23 February 2017
Alien: Covenant," So, not aliens at all after all that....
","I'm being a bit harsh, the film in many ways had some positive' attributes - some good cinematography, some good cgi, some nice new little twists, like the pixel dust in the atmosphere - but otherwise Ridley Scott, who I admire for many of his other movies, lost the plot with Prometheus and failed to find it again with this piece of malevolence. What sort of spaceship, even in the future, would have a massive shower with many jets of water so that a couple could make love in it together? Just a vulgar set up so that the monster could stick its scorpion-like tail up the woman's hindquarters to spoil the mood. Was that really necessary? Did that enhance everyone's appreciation of the movie - or was it just scraping the barrel of cinematic shock for its own notoriety? I could forgive an 11 year old boy writing something like that, but Ridley Scott? Michael Fassbinder did a magnificent job of being the evil, smooth talking robot - quietly and duplicitously murdering everyone and turning them into food for his pupae. But really, would no-one have not noticed until the last minute? That close was really the dramatic haemorrhoid on the butt of a disgracefully predictable plot. So yeah, they're not aliens at all then, just genetically engineered humans. Kind of defeats the purpose of the franchise. I just hope for humanity's sake that this is the last we'll ever see of this horrible, worn out franchise.",1,11,24,29 May 2017
