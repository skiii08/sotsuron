Changeling," Good film with interesting plot, but with flaws and bad performances
","Most actors are unknown (at least to me), and they are NOT good enough. The acting of all the kids is AWFUL!, especially so the most crucial character of all, that has to do with the disclosure of the mystery. (There are lots of great kid-actors all over TV, how come they were not casted and hired?!) Jolie's performance is not good, though not dreadfully bad. All characters are poorly depicted and cartoonized, and in a simply unbearable fashion the doctor at the Psychiatric Hospital! (and that is, unfortunately, Eastwood's responsibility.) The film is well paced, well directed, well photographed, as should be expected from any good director such as Clint Eastwood is. However, somehow he does not convey the proper tension and terror in those moments that the script required such elements (I felt the same in 'Mystic River'). I did pick the line that includes a word for a certain type of felony only coined decades later than the one portrayed by the film (the 30s), and it puzzled me as a flaw by the writer.I am a pro composer/arranger/producer/pianist from Paraguay (jazz-oriented), and knew right away from the first piano notes that that was Clint's musical statement. Very simple, somewhat corny, but effective melancholy-wise. Great composer-arranger Lenny Niehaus did not need to sweat too much throughout this movie. All in all:",6,3,8,31 January 2009
The Secret in Their Eyes," Absolutely impeccable, great film!
","I agree with SanFava. I am a follower of Campanella's and Darin. I have seen all previous three films. However, this one surpasses them all!. This is a great script, top-notch acting by everyone, partly thanks to the excellent casting. Superb cinematography. The film basically explores what 'passion' is to the human being. A great passion (on various areas) is involved in almost all characters. You have suspense, a clever detective story, some surprising twists, etc. Darin has an 'aura' (paraphrasing the the title of the film he worked in, 'The Aura') that illuminates the whole screen. His presence is as powerful in the screen as that of Gene Hackman, Pacino, DeNiro or Hoffman (the top, great ones). I sincerely hope this movie gets his due awards (Oscar included), because it deserves so!).",10,134,158,4 December 2009
Crash," Unbearable music, simply bad movie...
","I'm a pro musician and sometimes compose for TV and movie films. The music was unbearable!. If this is a film that 'is nominated for and wins lots of awards' we are in deep trouble!. NOTHING works and looks or feels real in the film. Everyone is so much underused that it is unbelievable.Check out great firs-rate films such as 'Tape' or 'Dinner with friends' to understand how relationships are portrayed to and felt by the audience. I don't understand this. I did understand that Spielberg's 'Munich' was such a bad film because he is simply not into it, but into entertainment movies at their best (the 'documentary look' with granulated texture does not fool anyone...c'mon Steve!). But that's for somewhere else!...",2,7,15,6 April 2006
Mulholland Drive," They've got to be kidding!...
","It still amazes me how people can be so easily fooled with some Europeanish 'mystery' ingredients in a film, by making them truly believe the movie is 'artful', good, whatever. OK, I am a professional pianist/composer/arranger (jazz-oriented, mostly, TV music, studio orchestras backing up singers, jazz player with my quintet).Some movies I consider very good:  'To Kill a Mockingbird'; 12 Angry Men; Usual Suspects; Memento; The Sleepers; Strange Days; The Fight Club; Strangers On A Train; Come on! I was shocked to find that everything I found just terribly awful in this film has been nominated (???) to awards:  Utterly non-believable dialogue; exasperated slowliness (please, don't tell me it was on purpose!!!); awful music score (which, BTW, disappears quite a lot which makes it 'Europeanish'); gratuitious rather long softcore Lesbian sex scenes; awful acting; laughable characters; confusion, confusion, confusion (get sober, Lynch!).   If I have to choose what was the worst, I would say the script...but then, script and directing are so indivisible (same person) it is hard to make a choice on either one. SIMPLY FORGET THIS TITLE and step ahead to something more valuable for your time and spiritual and aesthetic life.",1,10,22,8 November 2003
Crazy Heart," Mediocre film, great (as usual) acting by Jeff Bridges
","This is not an Oscar worthy film per se. Jeff Bridges is such a great actor...but he should have been awarded an Oscar long time ago, and not particularly for *this* boring movie. Maggie Gyllenhall is quite good and she looks lovelier than usual to me here. Robert Duvall is a total waste (great actor, very poor character). Bridges has been wonderful throughout the last 15 years or so, both in comedy (with BarbraStreisand) and drama, and even action. Colin Farrell's character could have been played by anyone!.The story has been told lots of time, the script is acceptable, the total product is finally a mediocre one.",6,0,3,13 March 2010
Up in the Air," Good film...period.
","This is a good film. It's certainly not a 'wow!' film, but does OK. The women are marvelous. Farmiga was already great in 'A Moment of Truth' along with Kate Beckinsale. However, Clooney...mmm. I still don't get what is it with Clooney! (Do his head tilting and eyelashes almost feminine waving have something to do with?) He must be one of the most unexpressive actors, probably only surpassed by Bill Pullman or Bill Murray. Jason Bateman is pretty unexpressive too (his face simply won't allow him to grab any strong (boss) character unless disguised with lots of make-up and special clothing). C'mon!. And then, I don't think this is a 'comedy'...no, no, no. (It does contain some witty and sour humor). This is a great (dramatic) portraying of a guy who wants to hang out and have sex with women without getting emotionally involved, taking advantage of his continuous flying job. He despaires when finds out he did fall for this one, particularly for the one whose game rules where just exchanging sexual pleasure with no strings attached!, and was shocked to actually see her in her family context (husband, and her children running along through the house, etc.).",7,1,2,8 February 2010
