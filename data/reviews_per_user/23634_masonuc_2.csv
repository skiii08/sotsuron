The Blair Witch Project," Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen
","Not scary, not believeable, not a good movie.  The woman was annoying, fake, and a horrible actor.  It is clear she is in on the whole thing.  The actors are pathetic.  I can't believe so many people actually like this movie, but, judging from what I've seen, most people who like this movie are under the age of 16, and those of us over 21 recognize that this movie is utterly terrible.",Null,0,0,24 September 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Worst Film I've Ever Seen
","The acting was horrible.  It was entirely clear the actors, especially the girl, knew the entire thing was a fake.  She is clearly egging them on to be scared the whole time, and noticing 'scary' things she would never have noticed if she was not in on the whole scam.It is not scary, not believeable, and not worth seeing.  They have done a great job marketing, and limiting theatre access (to get long lines, etc.), but the big joke is, this movie is horrible.  If you are over 16, you will hate this movie.  My date and I left early, completely stunned at how bad the movie, and the acting, was.",Null,0,1,22 July 1999
