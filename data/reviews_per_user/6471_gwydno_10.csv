The Blair Witch Project," You'll have the chance to imagine your own fears
","Boosted by a magnificent marketing campaign, this movie is still a really good work. This time you see nothing, no ugly faces, no bad guy seen, no river of blood filling the screen. It's your task to put a face to the danger the kids are facing... and if you come into the plot, they will be your own fears who will appear. This is what I like of this movie: it is your mind who frightens yourself.I understand why some people did not like this movie when they saw it, but for me it was really scary. Frightening enough to look for that little pile of stones in front of my bedroom when I woke up next morning :-) In short, a good movie, and people intelligent enough to raise the interest about it. They deserved the money they earned",8,0,2,26 September 2005
The New World," Pretentious but hollow movie. Really disappointing
","After seeing this movie yesterday, I can't describe it but as deceiving. Supposedly, it is a story about how the clash between cultures changed the style of life known in the Americas, through the eyes of an Indian 'princess', as well as a story of love and resignation. Hardly any of these objectives is reached. The movie is incredibly slow. The pretentious monologues, the apparently 'espiritual' voices in off, are pretentious and at times laughable. The key moment in the film, when Smith leaves, is so quick that it calls to no emotion. Q'Orianka Kilcher may seem a good choice in the first minutes, but soon you realize that this girl has only two expressions to show to the camera: her lovely smile that she shows a few times, and all the rest a boring mask that is supposed to reflect serenity, but fails completely in its purpose. When the film ended, all the people seemed awed. No one talked! I don't remember having seen the people so silent after a movie, without a comment. It seemed all of us were waking up from an uncomfortable sleep. A bad choice for a Friday night",2,1,5,11 March 2006
Taxi Driver," Bronson, Eastwood, Seagal, Norris... Showed the same in a far most believable way
","I was really disappointed with this movie. The incredible recognition that it always gets moved me to give it a chance, even if I knew that the plot was quite depressing and has been showed in similar ways by many other movies. And this is by far one of the worst of the type. It is so badly presented, and so poorly finished, that it makes Bronson's plain urban avengers and Eastwood's lust for violence real masterpieces. De Niro's acting is the only part that can be saved. Even Cybill Shepherd is unable to raise the overall bitter taste of this ultra-hyped movieIf you haven't seen this yet, save yourself some time for something useful",2,8,18,4 May 2009
28 Days Later...," Starts fine, but goes really down
","Overall, I left the movie room quite disappointed with this picture. The idea is good, the awakening of the good guy in a desert London is breathtaking... But the problem is that I simply can't believe the disease. I mean, it is not any effort to imagine a tragic illness that can drive the people crazy and spreads so fast that it results in chaos and death. But the attitude and behavior of the infected people is ridiculous. They're supposed not to be able to do almost anything, but they coordinate themselves to attack. Also, they are TRIBAL. Infected people live, sleep and act together, so they can attack the normal ones more easily... this is quite absurd. I couldn't understand why the father and daughter insist on announcing their presence to everyone, infected or not, by lighting on all those Christmas lights... My feelings went from the initial excitement to the final boredom.",4,0,1,25 August 2005
The Last Samurai," A good movie, especially because I didn't really expect great things
","I had really not great expectations when I saw this movie. I was just waiting to see another Hollywood smoothed show about exotic cultures, without any real compromise, historic accuracy or deep characters -especially when it was Tom Cruise who appeared as main character. I was gratefully surprised when I saw the story showed the least due respect to History, and towards the social and personal conflicts it depicts. Whether it is arguable that the Samurai philosophy is worth defending it, as a war-based style of living, anchored in a dark past disguised in tradition, the plot focus on the positive aspects that were perceived as endangered along the modernization of Japan. Of course, there is room for Western 'endophobia', since the bad guy is a Japanese Judas eager to earn money western-style, and as I explained before, it seems that the only way to express Honor and the quest for perfection is a fascist or maoist-like, isolated society. Yet the movie is fair enough to watch at it a second or even a third time. It is entertaining and well made, and it is easy to sympathize with the ideals of the Samurais.",7,0,1,29 June 2005
War of the Worlds," Horrible when it tries to be original. Needless when it doesn't
","Certainly, there is a lot of noise and shocking scenes in this movie. It is a generous display of FX and bangs and so on... But it is a complete failure. *Angry spoiler* The first horrible mistake in the script is why the hell those tripods were buried in ancient times. Ridiculous and completely unnecessary. Then that stupid story about the blood they take -and, apparently they swim in- from human corpses. It would be laughable, wasn't it because you have paid to see a good story, not this. With all the amounts of money that have been wasted in this poor work, I think Spielberg must not be satisfied with the final result. When I was watching this movie, I remembered the modern remake of 'Planet of the Apes' a few years ago. This was another insult to the original movie, exactly like this one. This story must have been absolutely awesome when Orson Welles drove the US to panic in the 30's. It was a nice and well looking movie in the 50's, although a bit outdated even then... and a complete bluff in the 2000's. Spend your money in something better",3,2,3,9 July 2005
The Green Mile," Fantastic. Unexpected masterpiece
","A really heart-touching movie. I couldn't expect it, but as soon as the plot was presented, I was absolutely delighted for all the emotions that came from the screen. How a message of hope, honesty and comradeship could be sent from such a dreadful scenario? I'm sure some people will be outraged about a bunch of criminals sentenced to death showing their fully human side, but this is the most emotive part, especially when it usually takes so long since the harm was inflicted and the 'justice' finally made. *spoiler* I have met some people that might compare with the black giant of this movie. People whose greatest desire is to offer Good expecting nothing in return, that finally become conscious about how rare they are in this world and how strange they look to other people. And there is no need of psychic powers for this. I only felt a bit disgusted because it is this pessimistic message that finally wins in the movie. Both Edgecomb and Coffey characters end up thinking life is either too miserable or too long to be lived. It makes you think about human nature and how good people must feel in this crazy world of us",9,0,2,30 June 2005
Scream," I really laughed when I saw this movie
","It's a shame that THIS was supposed to be an horror picture. The plot is so unoriginal, the performances so utterly exaggerated, and the bad guy... well, let's say it would perfectly fit in any Scooby Doo chapter. Really, many people said I should see this movie. I went to see it with a friend, and soon started laughing because the movie was plainly absurd. Fear? I would really appreciate if someone can tell me in which moment exactly I was supposed to feel scared. A few years later, it came 'Scary Movie'. Who needed to see that one? I had already spent a good time with this brilliant COMEDY. In short: what a waste of time and money!",2,4,11,29 June 2005
The Matrix," Absolutely overrated. And please, don't call it a sci-fi film!
","After almost two years of feeling almost guilty for not having seen this movie, and under the advice of many friends of mine, I finally took a look on The Matrix. What a waste of time! How deceiving! It seems it is enough with having a noisy soundtrack, a bit of misled oriental philosophy and some weird looking guys acting (?) to have people mouthwatering. Oh, yes, the visuals are great. Maybe the only contribution of this movie is the release of more or less new FX that could be used in further, more intelligent movies. It is incredible how so many inconsistencies can be found in the plot without making this movie lose a bit of its undeserved legend. Here are a few of the details that made this film unbearable to me:<ul><li>Machines are obtaining energy from biological sources. And from all the living creatures populating this world, it is the human race that is being used, when hundreds of species would have been much more efficient 'batteries', without having to create a Matrix to have them comfortable in their sleep - The Matrix is a virtual world designed to keep battery-people happy in their dreams. However, the battle happens precisely in this imaginary world, which has no sense. You can even diein this electronic world and your real body dies, too!!! - After being flushed away when he wakes up, Neo is rescued with an enormous device that was ready to act under the very nose of the machines</li></ul>Beyond FX, the movie is absolutely boring. You could always disconnect your brain and simply watch at the action, and rate this movie more or less high as an inoffensive entertainment. But then you must face all that incredible mythology built up around this movie, as if it showed a new philosophy or some scientific value! The worst thing of it, is that it is seen by many people as a sci-fi movie. Well, Star Wars deserve being called 'sci-fi' a thousand times more. Call this a fantasy movie, an action tale... whatever. But please not a sci-fi picture",3,2,5,15 September 2005
Contact," Some movies teach you something
","This is one of that kind of movies that leave you with the feeling that you have learned something by watching at it. I have always respected Carl Sagan since I saw the Cosmos TV series when I was just a boy. It's not only that he shows how science is, but puts so much heart on it, so much illusion that eventually you have to say 'thank you, Mr. Sagan', because you have really been 'infected' by his 'disease': the quest for knowledge and the joy of knowing. The same spirit lies on this film: we've been told many things that science knows nowadays, the script lefts the door open to develop our fantasies and illusions... but stops on time before figuring out too many things that could mislead us because we really don't know them yet. I also want to thank Sagan, Foster and all the people responsible of the script for showing the due respect to the religious feeling of most people, although pointing out the problems and paradoxes that the events of this film would cause if they really happen. I learned very much with this story about the wonder of being, the marvels of Universe, about respect and prudence. Again, thank you, Mr. Sagan",8,4,9,2 July 2005
