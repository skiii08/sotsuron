Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Boooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring!
","I saw this movie on the second day it was open. Packed theater, enthusiastic, young crowd. Everyone psyched. By the end of the film, I had nearly fallen asleep twice, and not once, NOT ONCE, did the film get anything like a cheer or gasp or ANYTHING out of the audience. I'm sure most people love this film bec. it's Star Wars so there is sentimental attachment from childhood and all that. But the truth is this film was a big wad of nothing. I didn't care about anyone in the film, the acting was wooden, the effects were gratuitous (i.e. there for show and not much else) ... my list of complaints goes on and on. I'm not a critic (not professionally anyway), so listen to me when I say this movie bites. But you'll see it anyway. Actually, you probably already have. If we could all admit that Star Wars is not about the movies anymore, but about selling badly made plastic products and/or soda to children, then we could cease arguing about the film bec. its artistic merit would be beside the point.

Cube," Good but not Great
","This movie was terribly original, I'll give it that. I enjoyed watching it mainly because it was not dumb and predictable like most alleged suspense films. The acting was a bit subpar, but the kinds of relationships that developed between the people trapped in the Cube were really compelling. I hated the ending, which I won't give away, but let's just say it's bleak and violent. I don't need a happy ending, but this one seemed gratuitously depressing. Still, a very entertaining film, unlike anything you're likely to have seen. 7/10 --Frink-3",7,0,1,25 July 1999
