Vertigo," one of the greatest movies ever.
","I personally think that Vertigo is the greatest movie of all time, although a couple of people before me who wrote reviews on this site think otherwise. For anyone who likes Hitchcock but hasn't seen this movie, and for anyone who has even heard about Alfred hitchcock let's get this out of the way, this is hitchcock's masterpiece. Psycho was a great film, and it's right up there  too, but Vertigo wins. I won't go into a lengthly analysis of the film, if you're reading this you've probably read the analysis. This is Alfred Hitchcock at his best, surreal visuals and incredible suspense, even more so than his other great picture, Psycho. The score by Bernard Hermann is possibly the best i have ever heard in a motion picture, adding to the suspense especially in the dream sequence. Unlike some of the people in the reviews before i'm deliberatly trying not to reveal the plot, i saw it the first time, without knowing what the story was, and not realy knowing that much about hitchcock and i was absolutely blown away. I think that's all i really need to say, i think that this is Hitchcock's greatest film and is required viewing for any lovers of suspense along with Psycho, of course, North by Northwest, Strangers on a Train and the 39 steps. And one last message, to any movie executives that are by chance reading this, please DO NOT remake this, it's perfect the way it is, you got Psycho already, isn't that enough?",10,2,4,10 October 1998
