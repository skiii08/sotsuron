Hereditary," One of the best of this genre
","I know that there are so many people judging the movie due to overhypness, cliches and lack of horror themes. However the main theme of the movie is far different from this.First of all, i want to categorize these kind of movies into 2 categories: Horror and Mystery. After watching so many type of these movies, horror should not be the main theme of a horror movie, however mystery should be. There are so many types of jumpscare movies in industry and most of them are worth nothing. Nonetheless, when you add the mystery part to the plot and when you interact with the audience to solve the puzzle it values much more but this type of movies are not for everyone.Main horror theme which is not the main theme of this movie is the mystery's itself. The mystery is behind the occult theme, demonology, trapping of the family, unclear cinematic effects at first. To be more precise, the horror behind the movie is the horror of unknown which is the mystery's horror effect. There are also so many plot twists that surprise the audience. It is not the movie that can be totally understandable at first watch. After the first watch, as a matter of course you create 'conspiracy theories' about the movie, about the details. You begin to search who is King Paimon what is his role in Arc Goetia. What is the meaning of clucking sounds and if you have watched carefully, you will begin to search what are those blue light effects in the movie what is the point of the usage of effects and you are going to see it is all settled brilliantly.I am actually a fan of these kind of occult mystery movies. However, this is not creating a bias after watching so many bad movies of this genre.Actings are good, music, coreography and their relation with cinematography is well builded. 10/10",10,2,5,25 December 2019
Wind River," Overrated
",Overrated. Nothing to imprint expect the combat scenes and the Winter landscape of Wyoming. Mystery things in the beginning was really good however its afterwards and ending up was really bad.,5,0,3,30 December 2019
Nightcrawler," Disturbing
","First and foremost, before i watch this movie, i thought that i'm going to love this moview. It took my attention. The idea is nice: An answer of a neurotic and thief on how to be a license to print money. But it is a great lack that there is no display of thsubstructure of character's work that he was doing. I mean it is really that there is no basic detail about that on a movie which shows everything realistically. It looks surreal that the character tells that 'He learns everything on Internet' even if he acts realistically. Therefore there are two main problems underlying the movie: First is the contradiction between the movie's realistic process and its unreal scenario. I mean it really worths nothing for a machiavelist man, who hates all 'empty career achievement words' and his main goal is to become a media boss. However, the main goal of a man who makes all this masterplans in the movie, should not be as simple as that.Second main problem is the moral sentiment of the movie. The machiavelist type of the character is getting much disturbing with the great acting of Jake Gyllenhaal. However there comes a moral judgment in the eye of the watchers, with the intention of producer: There is only one man who is an utter machiavelist and this machiavelist makes his job best. Therefore, there comes a judgment that, 'i don't want this man to be successful.' At the end of the first half of the movie i thought that, there are two possibilities for the ending of the movie. Either, this machiavelist, greedy man will obtain his goal or the ethical values and the moral principles will overcome the story's itself and everything will be upside-down and this greedy man will fall. So the ending is easy to predict but i wanted the second possibility at least but it did not happen ant it really distrub the viewer. Okey, it is the reality of life you can not achieve something, without stamping someone. Nevertheless, when i say that i 'generalize' it. I know that it is wrong but i would have tied the ending to more psychological thing. At least i would have tied the ending, for the character who lives like a robot and does not have a background, to a more suitable and tangible thing which would have made it a good villain. The best thing about the disturbance of the character is the acting of Gyllenhaal.",4,2,4,30 December 2019
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Weird Movie
","I don't want to write any kind of plot holes, logical errors or something like this. After The Crimson Rivers, i've never watched a good mystery/occult detective movies like this however, there is one and big problem about this movie.Finding the identity of Harriet Vanger and meeting her with Henrik Vanger took approximately 2 hours and these 2 hours story is ending after that, our journalist return to his own trial.This 2 hours story only made two things: Strengthening the bond between Journalist and girl's assist to journalist on winning the case. This should not be so easy like that. Otherwise, really good movie",8,1,2,25 December 2019
The Conjuring 2," So many logical errors?
","Most modern horror cliches consist same stuff: In the basement of old European or American houses (most likely belong to baby-boomers), there are some paranormal things. Most families that are living in these houses usually have more than one child and one of the child is usually a sleepwalker which is only used to misinterpret the paranormal situation to this natural process. The process that the audience is able to solve, can not be solved by idiot young family members. Horror scenes only works for jumpscare or preparing the jumpscare. Audience knows everything in the movie but characters don't. There are only a few breaking points that twisting the plot. Characters seem like everyday they witness posession of human body by supernatural beings.<ul><li>Man prepares a seance to girl, the house is getting darkened, a demon makes a sound and after one hour, there is still possibility to interpret the situation to neurotic disorder and the man who still think about this possibility is an expert at these kind of situations</li><li>The demon called Valak, is stupid enough to import its name on Bible</li><li>There is a neighbour who who witnessed the paranormal situations directly from the girl and that neighbour didn't even tell our protagonists this witnessed situation and took them to station. I thought that there is something wrong with this neighbour but the problem is on the movie.</li><li>In Lesser Key of Solomon, Valak is 62nd demon. It is greedy, Depicts, on the back of twin-headed dragon. According to some myths, it is the one that offers the apple to Adam and Eve but he was easily defeated by two priests.</li><li>Horror scenes are thriving, Nun character is really well made and frightening.</li><li>%10 mystery, %90 horror and shooting techniques.</li></ul>",7,0,1,25 December 2019
Climax," Good movie but not HORROR!
","This is a very brutal movie. A very good interpretation of drug usage. Especially, the dancing scenes are hypnotizing cinematography is marvelous and coreographs are really good but i watched this movie as a horror movie but it is not so don't do that if you want to watch.",7,1,1,25 December 2019
It Follows," Mystery
","If you like Hereditary i think you will like it too. The movie is in the forefront with its mystery theme. Main theme behind the horror is the development of plots, plot twists, so many riddles, puzzles and the theories after the end. Because the movie is not ended as like a crystal clear.The usage of different time situations but not inconspicuously and other details that is helpful to solve the riddles are really put remarkably. 9/10",9,0,0,25 December 2019
Get Out," Thrilling, well settled movie
","The movie is one of the most thrilling movies that can easily attract audience within 5 minutes with its cliche beginning of a typical horror movie however with its good cinematography and relation of so many movie elements. A good psychologial-tension movie.The main problem about the movie could be its predictable plot. However, this is not the main concern of the movie as i said above the psychologial theme is important. Main success of the movie that its ability that the audience can easily create empathy to put itself in protagonist's position. When you break down the plot structure, all little parts are setlled and acted brilliantly that overlook the predictable main story in the eye of audience. 8/10",8,1,4,25 December 2019
The Game," The Ending?
","I don't want to talk about the plot holes or inconsistencies within the movie. The movie was really built well. However, it could be so cool that if character kill all of them and say 'hey and it is my joke' which gives a bit tragicomedy and a bit of absurdity.",7,0,4,30 December 2019
Midsommar," Not as good as Hereditary
","I had a great expectations about this movie when i first saw the trailer and it is the movie of a man who created Hereditary which is one of my most favorite mystery/horror movies with so many symbols and details. However, when i first saw this, it was one of the most disappointing movie for me.On internet someone said, 'this is a psycological situation, the woman had lost her family and then her boyfriend was cheating on her so the paing turns into pleasure.' It is nothing about that. The ending is tied to nothing. There is no subtle connection of the death of family and the onwards . The only connection is main character's travelling to Sweden but this connection is also weak. Pelle that eccentric guy who you can easily predict from the beginning there will be a plot twist about that, actually manipulated the main character tu change her idea on travelling to Sweden.Let's talk about the bad guys.. Well, it is certain from the beginning but the main problem about that, everyone in movie see what you see but no one is questioning about 'WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE' or 'SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT HERE'Comparing this to Hereditary would be a blasphemy.Performances are getting boring afterwards because for almost 2 and half an hours, almost all characters are in the same mood, no change in the mood.Music is just meh.Cinematography is good.Let's review the symbolic language. In Hereditary, nearly all scenes have details on frames and have symbols about the content of the plot whether it is an object, a light, a visual or a text. It is not just the symbols also, the scene that seems the most unnecessary scene from the beginning is actually a metaphor that is reflecting the summary of the plot. However, there is nothing like this in this movie. There are used so many symbols actually but it is not necessary. It is like i was watching a documentary which is about an ancient pagan nordic beliefs and rituals.A symbol should be hidden. It should be used inconspicuously, like in Hereditary but they didn't do that in this movie. So the main aim of a symbol becomes POINTLESS.The old man fell down from the hill but his leg got rotten immediately, it was a cheap scene. All of our American characters are looking to top of the hill, there were an old guy and a woman. They are showing this for almost 5 minutes and not a single main characters (beside Pelle) reason that they will fall down.
Is this about the criticism of Americans minds? Because the stupidity of the main characters is too much to be real even there are 2 characters who wants to write an academic article in university about that.",3,1,4,31 December 2019
Sinister," Looks like a cliche but not
","I really like horror/mystery movies with referrence to ancient deities, occult, pagan themes. This movie has them.Using the child as a footman by an evil character is not the thing that i find right in horror movies. It really becomes a cliche and for me it is the main noticeable lack of the movie. However, the mystery, the atmosphere and success of creating curiosity in audience was really good 8/10",8,0,0,25 December 2019
The King," Joke
","A stereotypical prince whose interest is about war.. It is easy to predict he will be dead even if you don't know the history.I am not much a reviewer on the view of 'hystorical accuracy'. If the movie's itself have a really good concept of its own history and convince the viewers on this frame then i don't obsess to historical accuracy but this movie could not convince the viewers on this frame.Even all soldiers wear a kind of plate armor, which is not real. There is a difference between a soldier and a knight.I don't know that but when i read somethin it says that Dauphin, the French hair did not kill children in the forest.One of the most important scene is battle of Agincourt and it is really disappointing. The tactics in the battle are really terrible. You can win this war with this tactics if your enemy is dumb. There was no crossbow archers in French army. There can not be so many plate shiny armors in a battle. One of the main mistakes is not usage of tabards in the battle. You are shooting a battle scene but most of the soldiers did not wear any tabard therefore it is almost impossible to know who is friend who is enemy.Apart from historical accuracy, there is no good cinematography. Could not find any dark and epic atmosphere so the movie could not convince the viewer.
They are shooting a movie, with no gesture no mimics of the 15th century. It is almost like they put together cast and said lets shoot a battle scene. No good performances, no good character development...Most importantly, it must be a joke that the ratings of Alexander, King Arthur or Kingdom of Heaven is lower than this garbage.",2,2,9,31 December 2019
Don't Breathe," Same thing throughout whole movie
","I am not a fan of this movie.
The thing that made me off is the same thing through the whole movie. Survival in a sadistic veteran's home. Through the whole movie, you can see only one development in plot and it is really not a big deal and ending is just meh. You can not create empathy with the veteran due to his acts. After watching the movie, you put yourself in writer's position and begin to think how to make a better movie by using this good content?Yes the content, the theme is really good but the processing of these elements are just mediocre. 5/10",5,0,1,25 December 2019
The Descent," Don't like it
","Not scary, not creating too much tension, plot is ordinary, just the first half that builds the mystery is worth to watch. 3/10",3,2,6,25 December 2019
The Fountain," The Movie of My Life
","This is the second time that i saw this movie. Normally, i would've made reams of reviews but i don't want to do that to not break the enchantment.What you will find is 'death, where you seek the immortality.Explicatiosn are incredible. The story is actually very clear. The sections in Space and Spain is actually the illustration of the book that is Izzy writing and i think other scenes are reality but it is open-ended. In the book, she is the Queen of Spain and Tomas is the Conquistador who is seeking the 'Tree of Life' to save Spain. In reality, Izzy is dying and Tommy is bent on to save her. Tomas drank Tree of Life and cheated death with the result of losing both his life and Spain (The Woman). Metaphorically, after he drink the tree he drops his ring and dies and flowers grow from ground and his fragments poured to dead tree and tree revived. Both these scenes are the symbols of 'circle of life and death' which is the symbol of 'Ouroboros'.Fountain is a circular system. The water rises, comes to peak point then falls and comes back to filter and pumps upwards again and it is a circle. If it just rises forever, then there will be no water in fountain. So the existence is like that. If there will be no 'downfall' or 'death' there could be no 'life'.But the most beautiful thing that it is just an interpretation an it is open-ended.By the way i am astonished by the scene of Xibalba, the Mayan dead star of afterlife from Orion.",10,3,4,30 December 2019
Mother!," A symbolic journey
","Darren Arronofsky has so many movies that consist the themes of God, creation and myths. This movie is pushing the limits hard.The movie is not transfer the message to the audience directly. Because, the movie is allegedly about problems in a house of a married couple.The character that Jennifer Lawrence plays depicts Gaia which is the mother of earth. Javier Bardem's character is God's himself. Ed harris plays Adam, Michelle Pfeiffer plays Eve and their sons are playing Abel and Cain. The whole story and interaction between these characters are symbolizing these ancient religious stories in a different way within modern concepts. The symbolism for these creation myths are handled within a modern family problems in mystery movie. Quite a while, these symbolisms are used so well, that you can not easily get to the bottom of the story. Javier Bardem's God character sometimes reveals itself, but it is not true for the other characters. They really keep the secret well.Symbolism concept is generally used in movies on specific inanimated objects and concepts. For example, On Suspiria or Hereditary, the symbolism that is used within these 2 movies is not directly change the route of the story but assissting to the audience to create more curiosity on them. It is spicing them up. These are good details.However, the symbolism that is used within this movie is dominating the whole movie when it should just spice it up. I mean, the movie is depend on a myth's symbolism and therefore it decreases the pleasure of watching the movie. Because, at long last, everyone is going to be curious about the ending. Yes the myth is very good and the story is well written. Here, God always pardons everyone but Mother Earth does not. God forgives people even when they took Mother Earth's child and ate its parts. God shows great virtue on this matter but Mother Earth couldnot endure that and set everything on fire. On this matter, the child of Mother Earth can be seen as Jesus. God did not die and found himself a new Mother Earth.The situation of arriving 2 visitors which are Adam and Eve, and duality between discomfort of Mother Earth and eagerness of Gods from this situation is really good and worth-pondering.We understand from the point of view of Arronofsky on God, it does not want to be alone and always creating someone to worship and glorify himself. Actually, it is a cynical situation in terms of philosophy. If there is a creator which is pantocrator, these actions are redundant. As a matter of fact, loneliness and need of glorify is a feature of mankind not God's. From this point, we can see that Arronofsky used Antropomorphism view.On the contrary, Mother Earth character brings everything on for God. She is loving god deeply but thinks that her lover coan easily decrease the loneliness feelings of God. With a suggestion from Eve she wanted to make a child. Eve character is portrayed a character which is fond of marriage and lineage a lot.The disruption that is caused by the visitors such as Eve, Adam and other humans is a kind of depiction of brought of doom by mankind to nature.On first midnight, we have seen a slit on Adam's ribs and he is coughing continuously. In the morning after the first midnight, eve comes which means that, God, took Adam's ribs and creating Eve. There were so many symbolic references throughout the movie.God who could not find an inspiration to write his book, finally found his inspiration when got the first news of child. Worshippers, the mankind, disrupt everything after that. Mother Earth set everything and herself on fire and God finally took her hearth. We can see that heart at the beginning of the movie as a kind of diamond. That diamond depicts Tree of Life in so many esoterical beliefs. The house symbolizes the Earth and celing of the house is hexagonal and my interpretation for hexagon shape is, it is one of the most excellent shapes from other shapes.Finally, it is not a movie which deeply attracts the audience but symbolism is very good, gives good messages, giving a significant myth from different perspective. I like the movies that has so many symbols but not the movies which symbols preponderate whole movie but this is a good exception 9/10",9,0,1,25 December 2019
