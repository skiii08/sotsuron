Blade Runner 2049," People rating it badly are just people with an attention span of a goldfish
","People that watch movies for tits, ass and violence aren't going to like this movie even though there is some of that in the movie. The movie has many interesting themes and the cinematography is breathtaking.Now like my title suggests if you like movies that are easy to digest and by the numbers then this movie isn't for you, but if you like to think and decipher the movie for yourself then it is a great movie for you. I won't say anything about the story, but you should have watched the first one to understand a lot of key moments in this movie.",9,6,13,8 October 2017
