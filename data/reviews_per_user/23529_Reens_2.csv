The Blair Witch Project," Original....but over-rated.
","This movie is not at all scary. You have to respect it for its originality, though.  Many people felt nauseated after seeing this film because of the 'jerky' scenes..but this has nothing to do with the film being scary but rather same effect as being travel-sick.The ending was quite mysterious and abrupt and it left people wondering whathad happened. There was too much hype about this movie. Go watch it if there's nothing else to watch in the cinema.",Null,0,0,1 November 1999
Fight Club," IT BLEW MY MIND.............
",There are no words to express how much I liked this film. The story itself is so unique YOU have to figure out what's happening. Norton's performance is excellent. The story is totally unpredictable leaving YOU to comprehend it.... This film has brilliant casting and Finscher's direction is fantastic.This film is a masterpiece and will never be forgotten.,Null,0,1,15 November 1999
