The Avengers," X-Men, move over! Wow!!!!
","First of all, I'll say that I'm ranking this as a 9 out of 10 for an action picture. Maybe it's an 8 across all genres. I always ranked X-Men and IronMan as the top Marvel movies... Ghost Rider/DareDevil/Fantastic4 as the worst. I thought Capt America and Thor was OK as far as their own movies. Throw them all together and... WOW! Things I liked: each hero was showcased in some form or another. IronMan's rocking arrival. The internal conflict among heroes. Things I didn't like: Although Scarlett played her role very well, I do think showcasing Black Widow was a mistake. Those tiny pistols against the army? *ping* *ping* it did look pretty pathetic. Secondly, I realize that Capt America's uniform is original... but he stood out like a bad Halloween costume. Perhaps a VERY dark blue would have been better? Best scene... Hulk and Loki. I've never seen 500 people erupt in cheers and clapping... a few standing ovations as Hulk responded to Loki's rant. I'd likely pay the $13 simply to see that scene again.I'm curious to read the script. I wonder how much of the film is choreographed in the script. There wasn't a lot of dialogue, but when there was, it was excellent. By far the best pure action movie I've scene that I can remember. Awesome, awesome, awesome!To those that haven't seen the movie... make sure you watch the credits *wink*",9,3,8,8 May 2012
Skyfall," Good Action Flick, But NOT A Good Bond Movie.
","So, if this wasn't a James Bond movie... and if you changed the characters names, you might not know it was a Bond movie... then the movie was pretty good. As a Bond movie, I thought it was kinda lousy and I was disappointed. Come on, this is James Bond... we want to see daring and clever escapes, neat gizmos and gadgets. They even used an old Bond car from the 60's with all kinds of neat gadgets, none of which were ever used. Instead, 45mins of the movie is spent in a cabin. I don't know how the movie is deemed to be a top 3 Bond movie of all time? Yes, the acting was great, but the story as a Bond story?? WEAK!!!!",7,4,8,3 January 2013
Fury," Slip Into A Sherman Tank In WWII And Hold On!! Awesome, but...
","I love war movies, and having served in the Armed Forces I won't pretend to know the ins and outs of everything that is WWII, but I know enough to support my opinion. From the first 30seconds of the movie I felt like I was the fly on the wall within a Sherman tank. For me, that's all that mattered, it made the movie, it was original, and it felt authentic. Loved it! I will warn you, the movie was pretty light on story and goals, and surprisingly stronger on character. I liked it, and the lack of story didn't matter as I was happy to be along for the ride. The acting was top notch as expected.For the few people that posted that the movie was a disgrace to the American serviceman?? I presume you are referring to the 'guy talk' about female refugees, what nearly happened in the 'home', and the treatment of German prisones of war? You weren't there, and I wasn't there... but if you think this kind of thing didn't happen, you're a little delusional. Soldiers who lived this life and death volatility day after day? Suffering from inhumane conditions, sights, and sounds? They're going to be a little messed up. No disrespect to any US service people as we totally appreciate what you're doing (or the service personal from any nation out there)... but Iraq, Afghanistan... the situation was nowhere near the WWI or WWII environment. Just sayin. Look at the body count.So, the movie was awesome until the end. The final battle scene? Wow. Who wrote this? You did such a wonderful job up until now, but then... wtf? What a disaster. SPOILER alerts! Here are the numerous ways you demolished a perfectly good war movie, that had my eyes rolling and the audience whispering about how ridiculous things got. 1. War Daddy's tank disabled via a landmine. Send the young guy to the top of the hill as a lookout. Young guy spots 200-300 infantry (every 4th SS soldier is carrying panzerfaust/bazooka), a few mounted officers, and a few armored vehicles. Young Sherman crewman runs down the road, discusses the oncoming force with the Sherman crew, the crew debates staying with War Daddy, they prep the Sherman tank disguise, they sit in the tank and discuss life for nearly 4mins... hmm, this is a lot of time, and I'm surprised the young crewman outran the Germans in the first place. 2. 200-300 SS Infantry descend upon the tank, and surprise... the Sherman is manned and able to mow down a large number of SS. Beautiful! OK, but we already saw that every 4th or 5th soldier had Panzerfaust/bazooka, so why is it when you showed us a single German soldier with panzerfaust blowing to smithereens a tank with a single shot in the first battle scene... that now 200 infantry can't do the same thing to War Daddy's tank? 3. The Sherman is about to be swarmed with SS Infantry, let's toss out fragmentation grenades. OK. But since when do fragmentation grenades explode in a fiery explosion? I know, it's Hollywood... but, you lose points in a war movie in my opinion. 4. War Daddy's crew runs out of ammo, so they jump on the external guns. Four exposed soldiers versus 150+ SS Infantry. Wow, these Germans have TERRIBLE aim. Hey, let's get all suspenseful and show a German sniper crawling along the grass. Will he shoot War Daddy? Come on, there's no reason 150+ SS can't take out a stationary War Daddy on the .50cal. The sniper crawls to within 100ft of War Daddy. He aims through his scope, slows his breath. Bang! Hits War Daddy, but he's injured. Shoots War Daddy again, and he's injured... more? Hits War Daddy a third time and he finally slumps into the Sherman. Obviously 150+ infantry have such lousy aim, I'd expect the sniper would be just as bad? RIDICULOUS!Everything leading up to this final battle was awesome! But then they had the audience groaning at the final disaster. All in all, still loved the movie and will buy it when it's out. Just goes to show, 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Band of Brothers' are still the best WWII movies out there.",8,2,6,30 October 2014
American Sniper," Read An Honest Review Here For Once.
","I'm both a screenwriter and I've served my country, and yet I can take a step back and examine the movie from an unbiased perspective.First of all, I've read plenty of reviews here about how the US should not have been in Iraq and Afghanistan in the first place, and why did Eastwood choose to 'support' the war effort. Those reviews were followed by a 1-3 rating. My response to those people, I don't care what your opinion is on the US's involvement overseas. Rate the story being told and get your head out of your ###.Second of all, I've read reviews that trash the movie for glorifying war. Really? Do you lack the insight to see the story being told? Was Chris Kyle glorified? Sure, by his peers, and supporters of the war... but look at the other story being told. He was alone. He couldn't relate to home life. His marriage and relationship with his children were nearly destroyed. He was a personal wreck.Thirdly, the film is criticized for perhaps not showing Chris Kyle as he actually was. No film has the capacity to illustrate 'all that is' the character. You focus on a theme and a spine of your story, and you hi- light the traits and 'through line' to support that story/theme. If the writer had brought in other tidbits of information or news worthy events, the film would've been an overall mess. This is a story and it was told this particular way, and it was told extremely well. You have to respect that, but you don't have to respect the main character.Fourthly, why would they choose to glorify a cowardly sniper. Really? Every infantryman will take cover and fire upon the enemy, only the sniper does it better. The sniper is alone, or works with a partner, concealed yet exposed, and often has little support. You take hold of a sniper rifle and creep into enemy territory by yourself and setup your position and tell me how cowardly you are once you've done so. So if you feel they are cowards, perhaps we should eliminate the airforce - afterall, pilots are cowards for firing upon the enemy from 10kms away? Let's just have a bloody face-to-face one-on-one battle like the good ole Civil War Days and really crank that body count up. These people save lives. The film is being used as an excellent example in character, plot structure, and theme in film classes. The movie was overall, excellent. The story was told in such a way that the viewer can see both perspectives. Perhaps a lone wolf fighting for his country while holding together his home life by threads appealed to you. Perhaps you are strongly against war, and this story speaks to, that maybe America has become Chris Kyle. In the first ten minutes, young Kyle's father speaks: 'There are three types of people in this world. There are sheep and sheep dogs. While we are not sheep, lord help you if you are the wolf'. Chris thought of himself as the sheepdog, but some may say he transformed into the wolf. Has America transformed into the wolf? So, I don't understand why people against the war would hate on this movie, because the message and debate it presents is clear.For a pure war movie, 'Saving Private Ryan' retains top honors. I think people can support that movie because there was a terrible evil that was going to take over the world unless stopped. But, I don't think the fact that there is debate over which conflict the US should 'stick its nose into' should prevent us from telling those stories as well.This is an excellent movie.",8,15,33,15 February 2015
The Revenant," A Let Down
","I thought the first 40mins was excellent! The cinematography was excellent, such beautiful shots. Unfortunately the cinematography greatly supports my 7 rating, which might tell you what I think of the story. One can easily watch the first 40mins and the last 20mins and not really miss anything. Aside from the disaster, 'The Lone Ranger', I've never complained about a movie's length... but here it is, 'The Revenant' is an hour too long - the good thing is there's plenty of opportunity to go to the bathroom and grab popcorn without missing anything. I'm not sure why the movie has all the hype, unless you're into 90mins of a guy limping along finding shelter and something to eat. Best Actor? Really? I love DiCaprio, but this was far from his best role to date. The character didn't have the foundation for an Oscar nod in my opinion, and it would have been relatively easy for MANY actors to turn in a similar performance. I suspect there once was a compelling script here that was greatly tarnished my another writer or director's theme emphasis which resulted in numerous scenes that didn't add to the story, thus causing it to drag - like DiCaprio through the snow.Sorry. It only deserved one Oscar nod. Having said that, there are phenomenal individual scenes, and the cinematography is worthy of the big screen - so go see it. At least it's original and not a franchise sequel.",7,1,2,20 January 2016
Split," Everything was going great until...
","I think the movie started out great. I was captivated, intrigued, and was curious when the so called 'twist' was going to happen. The problem I have with this movie started in about the final 30minutes. SPOILER ALERT - The stage has been set, we're in a 'real world' with 'rules'. From out of nowhere, we have an insane person transforming and climbing on walls, bending bars, and brushing off two shots from a shotgun. For me, interest just went out the window. I was intrigued that this could happen to anyone, but a choice was made to bring in the supernatural. OK, fine... I figured this was all some artsy metaphors and perhaps all of the multiple personalities belonged to the girl which was intriguing. In the final moments it is revealed this is not the case at all, and we're in fact in the same movie world as 'Unbreakable' from 17 years ago. Really? That was the big clever twist? Tying a movie with so much potential to a 17yr old film that no one really cared about to begin with? Confusing the hell out of likely 70% of the audience with this seemingly random tie-in? I think Shyamalan failed here miserably. Why would you put in the effort to bring this together with another 'average at best' movie from so long ago? Hugely disappointed. This was not even remotely close to his best work.",5,8,23,29 January 2017
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A Disappointment
","I thought the Lord of the Rings trilogy was excellent!! So, when 'The Hobbit' came out, I was extremely eager to see the film... until I started reading reviews. Life got in the way of me seeing the movie in theatre, but I ordered my copy on Blu-Ray.I had the afternoon off. Had some pizza and my Coke, and started the movie. I wake up and the credits are playing -- seriously. So, I chapter search back to find where I fell asleep... 35mins. The next day being a Saturday, I start at 35mins and I wake up to see a magnificent battle scene with orcs and the dwarfs. Woah, what did I miss? I chapter search back to find that I fell asleep at 65mins in. It took 3 sittings to watch this disaster of a movie -- and I'm not one for falling asleep during movies.I'd challenge anyone to tell me the significance of the first 50minutes of movie. Way to put an audience to sleep with meaningless dwarf antics for most of an hour. This 50minutes could've been accomplished easily within 15mins. Frequently, the story dwells on 'nothing' but merely showcases how much money Peter Jackson must have accessible to waste this much film.If the Hobbit book didn't exist. If this wasn't the prequel to the Lord of the Rings. If this was simply the first notion of 'The Hobbit', this would be a disaster. The only reason it has been a success is it peaked the curiosity of LOTR fans. But then again, who am I to say... 8.2 avg viewers rating speaks volumes. For me, this was brilliant special effects, great acting, and extremely poor story execution! The movie failed enough for me, that I'll like rent the sequels on pay-per-view, but have no interest in shelling our $12 for a movie ticket or $25 for the Blu-Ray.",7,5,10,28 April 2013
Spectre," Spectre? Should be... 'Hanging By A Thread'
","Hollywood laziness! 'Oh, it's a Bond film, it'll sell'. I'll echo what so many others have said... 'the film insults your intelligence'. I see the current rating is 7.3/10, so maybe there's just so many terrible movies out the past year or two (likely), that this average at best film gets a higher rating?Aside from the mostly non-existent plot, my biggest beef was the believability. Ya, I get it, it's a Bond film. But, the Mission Impossible and Bourne series make it look believable. Bond's on a building that's about to collapse, he's gonna die! Nope! There's a couch that he lands on. Bond's got the girl, they're both gonna die!! Nope! There's a net that catches them. Where the hell did that net come from? COME ON! But, the biggest eye roll in the entire film was the love interest that was introduced 80mins into the film. The audience is supposed to believe Bond falls for this girl so hard in 20mins, and they have chemistry of any sort?The finished product was sloppy eye-rolling garbage. Bond was the king of spy/espionage films, and of late they're going down the toilet fast!! I won't pay to see another Bond film. I was severely disappointed.",5,12,26,9 November 2015
