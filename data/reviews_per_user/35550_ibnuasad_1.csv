The Avengers," Great CGI, Lots of action, Funny moments
","If you haven't watched Captain America or Thor, I'd recommend you to watch both as you'll understand more of the things that will transpire in this movie but even if you don't you'll still be able to understand the story.If you enjoy picture perfect CGI and special effects, you will not be disappointed as everything is just amazing and looks very real but I wish they would have made the CGI in the flying scenes better as sometimes the objects does not blend in with the background.Action scenes is typical of a superhero type movie but the funny moments is what makes this movie so unique. Funny moments from the beginning all the way towards the end makes this a very enjoyable movie to watch.",9,2,5,26 April 2012
