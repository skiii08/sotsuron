Minority Report," a 'nice' movie but a little boring
","I just went and saw Minority Report in the largest cinema in Denmark 1700 people sat in 2Â½ hour and saw a lot of fancy computer animation and a story that could have been done with in 1 hour, but maybe i thought there will be at lot of nice fighting and action in between the (short) story line - - - but nooooo there was just a lot of stupid things put in, and why did they push the final so long that when it finally came it was short and you did not give a damn. When the movie was over 5 people clapped and i think that says it all. 2 stars from me.",1,5,11,11 August 2002
The Pianist," What a long and incredible boring movie
","I will admit i saw this film by mistake, but how can anyone like this movie it's long and boooooring. The story in this movie is truly about a very serious subject , but after 15-20 minutes i didn't give a damn, i almost fell a sleep, half the theater i saw it in walked out before the first ½-hour, i almost left too but i stayed, because i thought no movie can be that bad, but i was wrong this one was!!!!",1,15,59,3 May 2003
