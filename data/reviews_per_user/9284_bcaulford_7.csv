Casablanca," Great cinematography
","This was a very good movie that highlighted an important part in history. There were many French citizens attempting to flee to America during World War II and in this film many were forced to stay in Casablanca waiting for a plane to take them there. During this period in time it was uncertain as to who would win the war. The photography in this film was awesome; there were many great lighting details and there was never a point where it was too dark where it covered actors and actresses faces. I noticed that shadows were especially never cast on female actresses faces and it was always shooting at the main actress, Ingrid Bergman, from the left side. This was great because her eyes were always glistening when the light was hitting her from that side. Even in Ricks cafe the lighting seemed natural as if you were sitting right in that very room watching everything take place. Overall this was a good movie with a good plot with great lighting and cinematography.",Null,2,3,13 March 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," Historically touching
","I found this film to be touching, not only because of the Joad family's unfortunate situation but because this really happened during the Great Depression and in some cases on a far worse level. It's a shame that the whole family started off with twelve members and at the end of the movie only ended up with seven or eight. I commemorate the overall spirit of the family for not giving up and working together to make ends meet and establish a life for themselves. During this time it was very bad for farmers because they were forced off their land with no other direction to go in. Many people died and starved and fought tooth and nail for even the smallest, short lasting job out there. What really makes this film touching and unique is the fact that this actually took place in history and it gave people some insight on how others were suffering and how to be kind and compassionate towards others. When the family stumbled upon the camp that was run by the Department of Agriculture it demonstrated the kindness and compassion that was needed in order for people to survive and make it through the next day. Having that ultimately unified the people into preventing a so called 'riot' to take place at a local dance just as a excuse for the sheriffs to show up and ransack the place. Tom and mama's little speeches towards the end touched the heart of the audience and affirmed the idea that no matter how hard things get in life you should always keep going and do your best and never give up to live a happy and healthy life. Another thing to add regarding the form is that the camera angles were very pleasing for being an older movie because during exciting scenes, like when there was a fight or a chase taking place, the camera man did very well in following every movement and the different angles made it more exciting to watch and made the audience feel as if they were really there watching it. Overall this was a great film in my opinion because a.) I'm a sucker for historical films and b.) the plot is one that could never get old and ultimately would touch the heart of anyone watching it.",Null,0,1,25 February 2013
Annie Hall," One of the funniest movies I've ever seen
","I really enjoyed this movie. It was quirky and funny and an overall great story about a dysfunctional couple who can't seem to stay away from each other. I thought that both Annie and Alvy's awkwardness was hilarious and in all honesty I though they made a perfect couple. I thought it was really cute when Annie moved to California and Alvy said that he would go over there and get her himself. I thought he was just playing around but he actually flew out to California to coerce her into coming back to New York. He even rented a car which he drove horribly, even worse than Annie. I also loved all the cool things Woody Allen did while they were filming. Like when he and Annie were standing in line to see a movie he approached the camera and started talking to audience as if they were also in the room. Also other things like when he and Annie were in bed and he wouldn't let her smoke pot before they made love and a ghost of her representing her mentality walked away and sat on a chair; he acknowledged the fact that she was not mentally there and talked to the apparition of her to represent that. It was just interesting the things he did to represent certain situations and how he made the audience feel apart of the movie and knowing his inner thoughts.",Null,1,2,1 May 2013
The Graduate," Twisted clich√© story
","This move was crazy and had a funny but ridiculous plot. It's kind of gross that Ben had an affair with Mrs. Robinson and then tried to date her daughter. It seems like a crazy, twisted plot but it made for good drama. I thought it was very funny how Ben was trying to screw up his first date with Elaine as much as possible when in the end he actually fell for her and wanted to marry her. Another thing that was funny was how the parents were so focused on what their children were going to do with their lives and in the end they just ran off together on a bus headed in no particular direction. I was happy that it worked out between Ben and Elaine and he they didn't get caught up in Mrs. Robinson's twisted games and the threat of her father keeping them apart. The lighting was relatively low key in this movie and the cinematography was very good. There were many great camera angle from where the viewer could see what was going on as if they were standing right there.",Null,0,0,1 May 2013
Singin' in the Rain," Very clear quality and overall a great film
","This film was actually very good. I'm not a real fan of musicals but I actually enjoyed watching this one due to the time period and the color clarity. I'm not sure why but this film seemed very bright in color and the picture quality was very clear even during dark scenes such as when Don Lockwood was literally singing in the rain after he dropped off Kathy Selden at her house. I also found it to be very comical like during the scene where Don and Cosmo were messing around with the speech therapist helping Don. Overall I found Cosmo to be the funniest character in the whole film. He was very likable and cracked so many jokes that it was impossible to not find him funny. The sound was very good in this movie too, I actually find it kind of ironic that it is a movie about actors filming movies and learning how to speak in their films. You could hear how bad the sound quality was when they were trying to record Lina Lamonts voice for her film. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and I believe it's the first time I've ever enjoyed a musical.",Null,0,2,22 April 2013
Pulp Fiction," Crazyness all over the board
","for starters I could kind of tell that this was a Quentin Tarantino movie because all his movies seem to be dramatic or I guess you could say realistic and bold. This is a harsh story about drugs, robberies, and just overall mischief. Vincent Vega played by John Travolta was involved in a robbery of a diner right as the movie began. Making himself seem like an upstanding young man he is also heavily involved with heroin and mob like activity. Things get strange when he is asked by his mobster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to escort his wife, Mrs. Mia Wallace, while he is out of town. It seems like a recipe for disaster however not in the way one would normally think. The two did not hook up but Mia was in a deadly situation when she mistook Vince's heroin for cocaine and snorted it and overdosing. When Vince finds her he takes her to Lance's house where he normally buys his drugs and gives Mia an adrenalin shot to her heart. That situation could have been messy if they had screwed up in any way. Overall I thought this was a good movie although sometimes hard to follow. The harsh truth to it all gives it the essence of a Quentin Tarantino film.",Null,3,6,1 May 2013
Psycho," Not the goriest horror movie you'll ever see
","Overall I found this movie very suspenseful and interesting. The fact that Norman was dealing with a split personality was a very strange way to explain the murders but at the same time I didn't see it coming. One thing that was somewhat pleasing but at the same time somewhat discouraging was the lack of blood and gore that you would typically see in today's horror films. During the scene of the first murder of Marion you could clearly see that she was being stabbed but at the same time you didn't see her cut up body, open wounds, or blood pouring down her body. You could only really see blood being flushed down the drain and even then it wasn't a lot of blood. I also found the cinematography to be good as well because during the murder scenes you could make out a shadow of the killer which made one believe that it was a woman because their hair was tied in a bun and you could clearly see women's clothing however that played an important role in making the murder unsuspecting by the audience and adds to the wow factor or the twist of who the murderer really is. Overall this was a well out together film and yet still suspenseful.",Null,0,0,22 April 2013
