The Devil's Advocate," 'Night of the world'- uncreated by fable
","No doubt that Kevin is familiar with the Bible, this is the weapon of the debate in his court in 'Mo Yizi case, he resorted to the freedom of religious belief of the party days India with eloquence eloquent Mo Yizi acquitted on the charges, plus Mo Yizi assistant prosecutor Arnold Modu facilities witchcraft, it coughing, unable to speak, and Kevin got his wish to obtain another victory. Famous football coach Vince Lombardi once behalf of Kevin shouted his voice: 'Winning is not everything, but only! Bible or religion or in the creation of four 60-game winning streak myth The young lawyer Kevin's eyes, but the tools to win the victory. The United States is a respect for the success of the nation, 'the exclusive worship of successfully goddess bitch' overwhelm everything, including God. Xu Kaiwen court numerous times to praise the name of the Lord, in his heart, God is but a trite illusory value symbol. This era is the era of man and the world is completely lost. The maze of free willMake free will answer the philosophers who believe that God create people are born with free will - are born with the ability to act in accordance with their own wishes. The face of the world, people can be free to make a choice. Therefore, evil and suffering in the world, is the result of the abuse of free will, this responsibility should be by the people themselves to provide us with. God is not interfered. From the words of the Bible, we can infer that: God created Adam and Eve when, inevitably given their free will - the event that obey the spell of the snake Tousijinguo this crime, is not based on the free will to make autonomous decision, while is responsible for the crimes they have committed a pre-determined by God no choice behavior, then, God, what is the reason to make Adam and Eve it? The philosophical insights is the one held by the 'devil's advocate'. Summit in New York, in the face of the nations bustling, Kevin chose an opposite road with Jesus Christ, step-by-step into the trap of the devil - based on the free will. Yes, free will! Kevin's mother and wife successively abduction by Satan, the same is based on the free will of independent decision. Satan never force others to comply with his will. God, he respects the free will of the people. 'I don't make things happen', he was just with a charming smile, charm by saying, to induce the people inside the original sin. He does not directly make any demands. He even twice put the persuasion attitude demagogue mending their ways. Free will, this is a wonderful word! In the eyes of the people, it embodied the pride and glory of the man. And Satan said: 'Free will, it is a bitch.' Bitch Italian English word 'bitch, slut, nasty stuff', full of humble and despicable mean. Sadly, if Satan is not wrong. Bear the original sin of the people, given human nature and the dark background. Night of the world ', dumping large town of Babylon, God-given free will of light in this dark human nature, it has been alienated to slut who gaudy jeweled. 'I'm a fan of man. I'm a humanist, maybe the last humanist.' Satan wanton interpretation of the words of Montaigne: 'anything that can occur in the human body and it was not inhuman.' His 'humanitarian doctrine 'is to distort the true meaning of free will along the dark humanity, his definition of' freedom 'is an absolute and unfettered freedom, one to do whatever they want to meet the desire of freedom. The paradox is that the absolute freedom, being mean absolute enslavement. 'Man is born free, but no go without chains. Precisely the desire, only the desire of the human heart, is the real shackles, people become prisoners under the order shall not be free. Conspiracy of Satan took advantage of the free will of the people of the world - which lost in the sea of ​​desire free will, step by step, to lure the world turned away from God and become degenerate. 'The 20th century was entirely mine', at the moment, Satan winner complacent. So, what is truly 'free'? Jesus as early as 'John.' Provides us with the answer: 'You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.' Face of the unexpected defeat of Satan desperately shouting: 'No! Damn you! Enough! Have not I given enough?' Ezekiel book describes the scene in an instant staged: 'Are you proud because of the beautiful hearts corrupted your wisdom because of glory, I have sent thee to the ground you down before kings, good that they may behold thee. sins of many, unfair trade defiled thy sanctuary. therefore will I bring fire from you issue the middle, devour thee, and upon the earth in the sight of all people watch ashes 'in a raging fire, Satan revealed a proud Blazing Angels Lucifer Mami. Satan carefully constructed dream collapsed in an instant. Out from the sea of ​​desire meditation from Kevin, the court did not hesitate to refuse to act as the spokesperson of the devil, the hearts of the people think: a hero was born, God, after all, to get the victory. However, Satan is everywhere. He was the embodiment of the snake, and also the embodiment of the law firm boss, he can transform himself into a tabloid reporter. Kevin's body, after all, keep the pride and vanity of the blood of Lucifer. Marian also as her ancestor Eve, enticed her husband swallowed sinking attractive fruit. The temptation is everywhere. Free will still trapped in the maze. The night of the world is still long. The dawn of being buried. 'Alas, Babylon the great! Moment between your judgment come ... never again shining light in the midst of thee ...'",8,1,2,10 April 2013
Children of Men," A good movie which is good at glamorizing atmosphere
","I was moved by the silence kept for only a few minutes but giving the whole human beings a chance to show their losing kindness and humility to new birth. The director was trying to express a true feeling hidden in our heart which is only to be dug out when we are in need of each other. This feeling should be treasured and kept forever whatever difficulties we met.Thus,what I'm quite sure is that people will be immortal. P.S. The photography applied in this movie is awesome. Being designed abundantly,it is very flexible and full of realism. I especially like the scene of boat staying on the sea surrounded by fog with an injured fighter and a great mother. And the hero acts well and shows the conduct of a gentleman. But it also has a shortcoming that it comes to end so abruptly even the girl doesn't get a time to show admiration or thanks to the hero which is a little pity I think.",9,1,9,7 August 2010
