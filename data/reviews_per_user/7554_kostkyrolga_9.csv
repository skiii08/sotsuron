Catch Me If You Can," Great movie!
","Leonardo di Caprio unrolling his amazing acting skills. It's amazing the fact that this is actually based on a true story. Quite unbelievable! It's much better than many other fictional stories. I'm totally not impressed that this movie is considered by many and old-time classic, because it is truly epic! Would definitely recommend!",9,1,2,13 October 2018
12 Angry Men," Great movie-Gives you food for thought
","I won't lie to you-when they told me this is a 1957 movie, I got scared. But this movie made me realize that, if a movie is genuinely good, it doesn't matter when it was filmed. If you have great actors, directing, and a great scenario like in this case, the least thing you need is advanced cameras and fancy effects. This movie really does make you think, and that's so important. It deserves its 5th place 's top rated movies, because it has an all time classic quality, since it promotes ideas that we are yet incapable of understanding. People need to watch this.",10,0,0,20 October 2019
Bird Box," Meh
","I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I'd want to. I found the story warped. We've seen a bunch of movies with warped scenarios in a way, either mystery or crime movies etc. But in most of these films, that whole weird situation makes sense at some point in the end. Yet, in birdbox, it didn't, at least for me. It's mostly a story about survival. That isn't necessarily bad, but in this particular case the whole concept was pointless.
On the other hand though, this movie has good actors, filming, sound effects etc. I wasn't disappointed at all from that perspective. It is certainly a good production.
To sum up, it's not a movie I'd recommend or consider watching again in the future, because it left me with a bland taste.",5,0,2,17 June 2019
The Number 23," Mediocre
","Although I found the story ending quite interesting and unpredictable, this movie as a whole did not keep me at the edge of my seat. Acting was a bit poor and half of the scenes included cheap, vulgar sex which could obviously be avoided, as it didn't contribute to the storyline. Thus, it's not a movie I would recommend or watch twice.",5,1,4,13 October 2018
Unknown," Worth it
","Uncountable plot twists, good acting, filming and directing. I really enjoyed it. It kept me at the edge of my seat.",9,1,1,20 October 2019
Coco," An exceptional animation movie!
","To my opinion, Coco is undoubtely one of the best animation movies that have been released the past few years. Its authenticity amazes me, because we rarely see such creative concepts nowadays. Interesting plot, interesting characters, majestic animation and beautiful music! It also promotes valuable messages for younger audiences. I watched it as a 17 year old, but you can definitely watch it very pleasantly as a kid and as an adult.:) You should definitely give it a chance!",9,1,1,25 April 2020
Woman in Gold," Great work!
","Helen Mirren, the film protagonist, proved that she is an exceptional actress. She truly served her role and her acting was so convincing it almost felt like you were watching scenes from your daily life. Ryan Reynolds also played very well and they both made a rather special but successful duet.As for the plot, it is very interesting, unpredictable and it addresses a very touching and modern historical fact. I assure those who hated history class back in school (me included) , it's nothing like that, but much better. It only has the captivating and educational aspect of it.Finally, the director, producers, costume designers etc also did a great job. So, in a nutshell, it is a movie I would definitely recommend to people who want to watch something of quality and wish to enjoy themselves.",9,1,1,27 April 2019
12 Years a Slave," Excellent!
","This movie addresses the issue of slavery that is a noteworthy part of America's history that many people are not totally aware of. It is a must-see movie not only because it is centered on such an important topic, but it also a fantastic movie from all the other aspects. Acting, directing, costumes etc.",10,0,1,13 October 2018
Green Book," Great movie! (tiny spoiler contained- it doesn't determine the outcome or progress of the plot really though)
","I enjoyed everything about it. The scenario, the characters, filming, directing, everything. The humor was also exceptional. I was absorbed in the movie until the very end.
What's very interesting and special about this film is that it gives a different perspective of racism against Afro-Americans, because it talks about an Afro-American that had a completely different lifestyle. High class, economically successful, always formally dressed, performed music for the Western European people etc. Before watching this movie, I'd rush to the conclusion that he'd be very respected because of his fame and skills, but that was certainly not the case. There was prejudice about him from both sides: light skin colored and dark skin colored people. I had the impression that individuals like Aretha Franklin or Sam Cook wouldn't have to deal with racism that much: but maybe they faced it, just like Don Shirley did. Therefore, this movie presents everything from a very unique angle.
It's a movie I'd definitely recommend, not only for entertainment purposes, but also educational and awareness reasons.",10,0,2,7 July 2019
