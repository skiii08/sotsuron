Catch Me If You Can," Poorly paced but in places enjoyable
","Maybe I've been watching another film to some of the other people on IMDb, or perhaps it's because I've been having my own little classic movie fest over the past two days (with THE BIG SLEEP, THE THIRD MAN, THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS etc).  Whatever the case, I was decidedly underwhelmed by Spielberg's latest offering.The cinematography was very pleasing, Leo did a good job, the period detail was all there, there was some nice use of music (though not nearly as much as I was expecting) and there were some brilliant, laugh-out-loud sequences but... it just didn't work for me.  The film's pacing was all wrong IMHO: far too slow at the beginning and between every major con; by the half-way point I was clock-watching, something I very, very rarely do in the movies. Usually I get very easily sucked into a film but in this case I just wasn't. Oh, well, my loss I guess.  In terms of rating, the film gets points for craftmanship but is dragged down by the pacing and Hank's phoned-in performance to a straight average mark of 5/10",4,1,10,2 February 2003
Minority Report," Enjoyable but no Blade Runner
","Certainly some negative comments voiced here are pointless and probably intended to wind people up.  However, this is not a reason to go over the top in response with praise for this movie.  This is a beautiful film, no argument.  Speilberg knows how to frame a shot better than anyone and his cinematography is stunning.  However, it suffers (like AI before it) from a forced injection of sentimentality and slush at the end, a very guessable plot (and this from someone who usually fails to guess; the old chap was just so obviously up to no good), and -- most importantly -- excessive media hype, which led the viewer to expect another BLADE RUNNER.  After coming out of the cinema I gave it a 6/10 (good; above average) because of the latter; now some reflection and a viewing without preconceptions pushes me more towards 7/10 (very good; excellent, but not an all-time classic).",7,0,0,25 February 2003
