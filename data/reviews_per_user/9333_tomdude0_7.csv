Sucker Punch," Most Underrated Movie of the Year
","Sucker Punch is about a girl, Baby Doll who is institutionalized by her evil stepfather so that he can obtain the inheritance left to her by her late mother. At the institution, Baby Doll meets the other girls-- Rocket, Sweet Pea, Amber, and Blondie, as well as the evil owner of the institution, Blue. Baby Doll learns that a character known as the 'High Roller' is coming for her in 5 days. She decides to escape from the facility before then, and retreats to an alternate reality to help her and the other girls execute an escape plan.For the most part, the story was excellent. There were some melodramatic moments, especially towards the end, but there are many more great moments than bad ones. I'll admit, the acting of the girls wasn't great, which was a hard hit seeing as the film is centered around them. Oscar Isaac did a good job as Blue, but Carla Gugino's Russian accent was...um...strange.I thought the alternate reality idea was great and really original. Basically, Baby Doll can use music to enter the alternate reality and she envisions the other girls there with her. The girls must obtain five items in order for them to escape. There are different levels of the alternate reality, and in each one the girls obtain an item that represents an item they need to get in real life. As they obtain the items in the alternate world, they obtain the items in the real world.Overall, the movie was really good, action-packed, and had amazing visuals. The portrayal of women was questionable though. Still, a great movie and deserves more credit than what it's given.",9,9,17,15 May 2011
Twilight," Doesn't deserve a PG-13 rating
","First off, this film does not deserve a PG-13 rating. It is rated PG-13 for 'some violence and a scene of sensuality'. Well, in the whole film, there's really only about ten minutes of 'violence'. And the sensuality, it's not at a PG-13 level. This film could have been fit into a PG rating, but nooooo. It was rated PG-13. I think that the only reason it was rated PG-13 was because the book was a young adult book and they decided to rate it according to the targeted audience for the book. This movie is a PG level movie.I read the book just for the heck of it, I can't say that I loved it, but it was much better than the movie. The movie was mostly talking, talking, talking, ooh-aah, kiss scene, talking, talking, talking, WOOT FIGHT SCENE, talking, talking, talking, happy ending, the end. If you haven't seen this movie, I pretty much just summarized it for you.The dialogue needed a lot of improvement, whoever wrote the lines for the characters seriously needs some writing lessons, and the lines from Edward was like he was from a different era.Overall, this film needs a lot of improvement, if the sequel is not better than I might just start to lose it.",4,1,4,24 July 2009
Wreck-It Ralph," Hilarious and filled with genuine emotion
","I went to the theater with my friend, with the intention of seeing Skyfall. However, upon finding out that all showings of Skyfall had been sold out, and that the next theater we went to wasn't even playing it, we settled on Wreck-It Ralph, since we had both also been wanting to see it. I went in with high expectations, and the film did not disappoint--in fact, in exceeded my expectations.The story, while it seems rather formulaic as a kids' animated movie, is really quite good. The writing is solid and provides the audience with an excellent understanding of just about every character. The film, thankfully, is not predictable and actually kept me guessing towards the end.The characters themselves are incredibly likable. Ralph isn't exactly the archetype hero, but we are shown that despite his tall height and short temper, he's really a good guy. Fix-It Felix and Calhoun provide some excellent comic relief. Jane Lynch's voice acting is superb. But the real gem of the film is Vanellope, who is probably the most adorable thing I've ever seen. It's simply impossible not to like her.Wreck-It Ralph is as good as it gets. With an amazing cast of characters, bright animation, and a story that's filled with genuine emotion, this movie melted away all my masculinity. I haven't teared up this much at the end of a movie since Toy Story 3. I cannot describe this movie any other way except to say that it is perfect.",10,3,4,18 November 2012
2012," Not bad
","If you didn't like this movie, you're probably being too critical. This is one of those movies where you shut off your brain and just enjoy the mindless action sequences.Story? Not great. The characters are all somehow connected but this is really just the typical Roland Emmerich disaster formula. Several different groups of people, they come together, huge disaster, most people die. Sound familiar?With that being said, this is probably Emmerich's most emotionally charged film--which is to say, there's a minimal amount of emotion in it. I actually didn't want some characters do die. Of course we get the typical brief backstory of each character through dialogue that is pretty much weak as ever.However, like I said, this is not a movie to be critical about. Just enjoy it. My only complaint is that the end of the world was an hour too long. The disaster sequences do get a bit tedious after the 2 hour mark.",Null,0,1,28 September 2011
Kick-Ass," The Next Generation of Superhero Films
","I loved this movie! It has a perfect combination of stylized violence and witty humor, something other films have tried and failed at. The acting was superb, as was the storyline.'Kick-Ass' is the story of Dave Lizewski, your average high school comic book geek. He decides to become a costumed hero and fight crime because no one else has bothered to. He fails miserably and is severely injured, resulting in surgery in which his bones are mended with metal plates and nerve damage diminishes his ability to feel pain. However, Dave is unfazed and goes out on patrol as Kick-Ass almost immediately after recovering. He breaks up a fight in which one man is being beaten by several others, and a video taken by a bystander becomes a viral sensation.Later in the film, Kick-Ass meets fellow superheroes Red Mist, Big Daddy, and Hit Girl. Red Mist, like Kick-Ass, is a teen, but he has a dark secret. Big Daddy and Hit Girl are a father-daughter superhero team, Big Daddy being a man of middle age and Hit Girl being his preteen daughter who is a formidable foe and an expert at killing. They unite to take down mobster Frank D'Amico.My favorite character was Hit Girl. Chloe Moretz did a great job as this foulmouthed, vicious, preteen superhero for an actress of her age. Hit Girl easily stole the show and this movie wouldn't have been the same without her.My only complaint about this film is that the Big Daddy character wasn't developed very much. Despite Nicolas Cage presenting an impressive performance as the vigilante dressed as Batman, I couldn't help but notice that not much happens with him throughout the film.In your average superhero movie, the heroes are merciful defenders of the innocent public, and the villains seem like pure evil but they have good inside of their hearts and they change their ways. 'Kick-Ass' portrays heroes and villains as they would be like in real life: brutal, ruthless, and determined. Frank D'Amico is ruthless. The 'heroes' do not spare the villains' lives, they gun them down without a second thought.'Kick-Ass' is the next generation of superhero movies. It portrays the dark side of human nature as well as just how far some people will go to stand up for what they believe in. The first thought that raced through my mind after seeing 'Kick-Ass' was: 'Sequel.'",10,4,14,23 April 2010
Avatar," Visually Stunning, But Not A Film I'd Remember
","This film contains the greatest special effects I've ever seen. I'm glad I didn't see it in 3D, or I'd be having headaches.'Avatar' takes place in the year 2154. Earth has run out of resources and they have come to a distant moon, Pandora, to get Unobtainium to save their dying planet. However, the natives on Pandora, the Na'vi, are unwilling to give up their land. Handicapped marine Jake Sully is part of the Avatar Project, a project in which humans transfer their consciousness to their Na'vi counterpart to aid in relocating the Na'vi residing on the biggest deposit of Unobtainium in the area.Although the storyline sounds promising, and it is a rare film in which the earthlings are cast as the villains, this film is forgettable. You'll never forget the effects, but as a film itself, it just disappears as you watch it.",6,1,3,24 April 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Fun to watch, but that's pretty much it
","So...remind me what exactly this movie was about.There's no SCRIPT. The film just wanders aimlessly for two hours and only starts remotely making sense in the last half hour. It's like the filmmakers were just making it up as they went. There was hardly even a plot.What was left somewhat saved the movie. The action sequences and jokes made it pretty fun to watch. But that's it--the movie is just eye candy.This is one of those movies that's just dumb fun, something you watch when you're looking for in-your-face action and not much else.",5,1,6,16 June 2011
