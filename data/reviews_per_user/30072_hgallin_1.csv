Whip It," Despite following a simple formula, one of the better sports movies ever made
","The first time I watched Whip It about four months ago, I did not really think much of it. I thought it was a pretty good movie that I wasn't going to think about much. However, I watched it a second time about a month later, and fell in love with it. Whip It is a film that is endlessly entertaining. I am serious. You will never be bored while watching this movie. I have seen it six times, and nothing has ever dragged in any of the viewings. Ellen Page, like usual, is exceptional in the role of Bliss Cavendar, a senior in high school whose mom had made her compete in beauty pageants for what seems like her whole life. However when the opportunity arrives for her to join a Roller Derby team, she takes advantage. This is Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, and it really could not have gone better. Despite having a lot of sports movie cliches and following a simple formula, Whip It stands out because of the style, the incredible soundtrack, as well as the sport that is being played. There is just something about roller derby that is great for a movie. Also, this film has probably the best romance scene in a non-romance movie ever. Just saying. Critics, audiences, i mean, everybody likes this movie, and it has rightfully developed a cult following after a disappointing showing in the box office. Give this one a look if you haven't already.",9,0,0,21 February 2019
