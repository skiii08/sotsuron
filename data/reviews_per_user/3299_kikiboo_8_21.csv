The Blair Witch Project," Abandoned after half an hour
","I generally don't like movies with witches, but I thought to give it a try. Didn't like it, it's a waste of time. Pretty bad graphics too. Moving on.",2,1,9,10 August 2019
It," Lame and overrated
",Never been scared of clowns or found them intriguing or interesting in any way. Guess that might play the part. Other than that this movie is nothing but a bunch of whiny kids vs a crazy clown. Yawn.,3,1,3,21 June 2019
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Nice
","Warm, funny and pretty nice. Great story, but nothing I'd watch more than once or twice.",7,0,0,26 April 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Lovely
",My favorite Disney movie ever without a doubt. Wonderful. Magical.,10,2,2,31 July 2019
Blade," Just not for me
","I love vampires, not particularly crazy about action movies. The two combined didn't exactly leave me wanting more.",3,0,3,21 August 2019
Sleepy Hollow," Nice scenery
","It was whatever. I think I liked the whole aura of the place, the way things looked much better than the actual plot.",7,1,1,18 July 2019
Silent Hill," Amazing
","I know nothing about the video games, the history or anything else about Silent Hill. Still this movie is incredible. Music is dark, emotional, hauntingly beautiful and deep. Sharon is adorable. Rose is gorgeous and a wonderful mother. Cybil irked me in the beginning. Cop or not, what gives her the right to follow a car without any legit reason at all? In the first scene with the 'darkness' in town itself the screeching that creature was making took me aback. Must be one of the worst noises I've ever heard in my whole life. Overall atmosphere of the town is dark, creepy and odd. Music adds to it more than all the fog, empty streets or ruckus. I absolutely hated Anna, all those despicable monsters ('people') in the church. Not to mention Christabella. She is the one manipulating all of those brain dead morons which led to the town becoming their personal hell. Her death was probably the most gruesome movie death scene I've ever seen, but at the same time most satisfying. Imagine barbed wires ripping you in half literally. It had to be beyond excruciating. Yet, when it comes to monsters like her... No punishment is enough. No amount of pain is enough for her to repay all the monstrosities that she's done. Maybe a better punishment for her would be to burned alive, but alive, stuck in the attic (or whatever it was) just like Alessa was. Fate worse than death. Some forms of life are worse than death, and that's precisely the kind of fate Christabella richly deserves. I just didn't understand why wasn't Rose's husband experiencing the same kind of hell and darkness as she did while in Silent Hill. And why was he able to get out of there but she wasn't? And the whole she's a demon, a devil, a monster and a shame to the family, to town and whatever cause she had a baby out of wedlock? Enough to make anyone want to puke. This is one of the many examples of religious people being much bigger monsters than others, who don't care much for religion. Ok, these are mental fanatics, for sure, but in general religious people are worse. Great movie all in all.",10,1,1,14 August 2019
Tangled," Meh
",Too long. This 'mother' might as well be the most selfish villain of Disney's. It's really nothing special.,4,0,7,2 August 2019
Forrest Gump," Overrated
","Slow developing, fairly predictable and boring. Dragged out for two and a half hours... It's not bad, it's just not anywhere near as good as it's made out to be.",4,0,2,29 June 2019
The Shining," All time favorite
","This movie will never get old. It's awesome. So much fun. Depth. Everything. I can't say I love all the characters, but each of them has something going for them, I'm not really indifferent to any of them. Music is really good too. Jack's slow descent into madness... I could watch it over and over and over again.",10,0,3,16 June 2019
The Exorcist," Pretty fun
","It's not scary, but it's fun to watch anyway. Considering how old it is, it's pretty good.",7,1,3,21 July 2019
The Little Mermaid," Not for me
","I don't like Ariel. She's very thirsty and desperate... Plus there is just something about her, not sure what exactly but I just don't like it. Then I don't find the story compelling either. One of the worst Disney movies in my opinion.",2,3,14,2 August 2019
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Decent for a Disney movie
",I liked it. Enough to sit through it. So different from most other Disney movies. That's a good change.,5,0,3,11 August 2019
From Dusk Till Dawn," Very fun
",Loved it. More funny than scary to me. Too bad Kate didn't join Seth in the end. It would've been more fun. Didn't care much for Richie. He was a tad annoying. All in all this lands among my favorites today.,10,0,0,19 August 2019
From Dusk Till Dawn," Very fun
","I liked it. It's pretty fun. Though if you ask me this is more of an action/horror/comedy than anything. Why isn't comedy anywhere in the description? It's damn funny. And Seth cracks me up. I just don't like how hideous they made the vampires. I didn't like Richie much, so I'm glad he's gone. Maybe it'd make a better ending if the girl went along with Seth. They'd make hell of a team.",10,0,0,19 August 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Lame
",I much prefer the Disney version for too many reasons to list here. Some things are better left untouched.,3,2,5,31 July 2019
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Boring
",I found it endlessly boring. Her singing voice is pretty annoying too.,2,1,6,25 March 2020
Halloween," Very overrated
","Ok, so this one starts out with Michael killing his family. It's literally the first thing that happens in the movie, aside from his sister making out with her boyfriend. Anyway. The point is it gives zero history or background for Michael, which would make it easier for me to grasp him. I have the vague idea that most of the movies in the franchise are all the same. Michael going around killing. No plot, no depth, no nothing. So I'm not going to bother watching them. Except for Rob Zombie's version which seems a tad better.",6,1,4,16 July 2019
1408," Weird
","I'm not too fond of movies with many different endings, especially when they're as confusing and ambiguous as this. Movie wasn't that bad all in all, your typical haunted house jump scares. The room was evil. Sadistic. It would have been much better if viewers could get some kind of background, some explanation, anything, instead of just 'the room is evil and all these things happened in it.' Come on! How can a room be evil? It's not alive. Is it some kind of a ghost? Evil spirit? Demon? What? Something has to be behind all of it and the fact that the manager never bothered to try fixing the underlying problem - the room being haunted by some evil presence, instead of simply saying the room is evil, nobody can stay in it... It's stupid. There are way better horrors to spend your time on. This is a big failure for my tastes.",2,1,3,21 June 2019
The Sixth Sense," Great movie
","Not sure why I didn't see that end coming. Guess I never thought about what happened to Malcolm, assuming he simply survived and moved on with his life.",10,0,0,7 January 2020
Cinderella," Might have been great in its days
","Nowadays a bit ridiculous. Who would allow themselves to become a servant in their own home? Who would marry a guy they met once? I guess it was a good movie at some point, but no matter how cute or magical it may be, it's still a tad ridiculous now.",4,0,0,25 April 2020
