Hereditary," It has its moments, but it is not a masterpiece.
","The movie was alright. Although I definitely understand people's frustrations with the ending. It's 2+ hours long, and it is a very slow burn getting to the last 15 minutes, where there was so much crammed in, that you can't help but laugh at the messy way in which it's wrapped up.Personally, I didn't hate it like a lot of people, but ultimately, it's a forgettable movie. It's definitely not a milestone of horror like some people claim.",4,4,6,30 September 2019
