Vertigo," Not hitchcock's best
","Pros: Cinematography, characters, directing, score.Cons: Dull.Vertigo has been often discribed as Alfred Hitchcock's most personal movie and it shows. It stars James Stewart as a man who has vertigo, a phobia of some sort which makes him scared of heights. he is assigned by a friend to watch his wife (Kim Novak) who he believes is haunted by ancestral ghosts. Stewart falls in love with her but she dies on him. Distraught, he finds another girlfriend and tries to recreate Novak's appearance as closely as possible. Kim Novak and James Stewart prformances are brilliant and Barbara Bel Geddes is amazing as Stewart's ex-lover midge. The only quibble I have for this film is that it is remarkably slow and at times dull. But it picks of at the last hour. Not the master of suspense best, but it rounds up his top five. The plot twist at the end is probably better than the twist in Psycho.Premise: Stewart, who suffers from vertigo, is assigned to protect Novak.Vertigo was nominated for two Academy awards.Grade: 8.7/10 (Great but not the master's best).",8,1,3,2 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Recanting my views
","Pros: script, score, incredible special effects, light saber battles, costumes.Cons: Jar Jar Binks, lacks the humor of a Han Solo-like character.My earlier review of the Phantom Menace was a bit harsh and I criticized it for being too childish. I rated it a 6.5 and now I wish I could take it back but maybe I can with this review. After reviewing the movie, I proceeded to see it again and this time pay close attention to the plot intricacies the film had. Upon finishing the movie,I came to the conclusion that this movie was better than the first Star Wars. There I said it, let the hating begin. I believe that this movie will be regarded as one of the better films when the saga is complete in 2005. But if one states a claim, he must prove it and I shall with these points.1) The special effects: A Star Wars film isn't one without the amazing special effects and this film happens to have the best one in the whole series. Although it has an advantage as it was made 20 years after the original, nevertheless the special effects are the best. The pod races are probably one of the most trilling race sequences put together and the creatures look more believable as they are given more flesh with the aid of a computer.2) The light saber duels: The Phantom menace has the best light saber duels out of the whole series. Seeing Qui Gon Jinn and a younger Obi Wan Kenobi duking it out with Darth Maul will bring yelps of excitement out of a any Star Wars fan.3) The force: With this film, we witness the Jedi Council as they once were and the Jedis for what mighty warriors they were, and also the force is very strong with this film. The older films didn't show us enough power of the jedis and they were also a dying race in the old films. Here we see them in their full might and it seems that every citizen is scared of them. We understand the responsibilities and power that comes with becoming a jedi.4) The Story: While episode 1 was criticized for having a boring story. One must look at the fact that the galaxy wasn't in turmoil at that time so something as trivial as a route tax was big for them. This movie showed us how peaceful the galaxy was before vader and the emperor decided to terrorize it. It also gives us great character analyzation for vader instead of people remembering him as a man with a hockey max who couldn't breath well.Hopefully with this points, some of you may realize as I have come to realize that Episode 1 deserves its rightful place in the trilogy as the one that started it all.Premise: A federation aims to capture the small planet of Naboo to pressure the senate to conform to thier views.Episode 1 was nominated for a couple of razzies.Grade: 9.8/10 (An underappeciated classic)",9,20,29,8 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A kiddies movie for an adult audience
","Pros: Special effects, fight sequences, action sequences, score.Cons: Directing, overbundance of special effects, script, characters, Jar Jar Binks, pacing.Episode 1 when viewed along the other Star Wars movies is a terrible movie, but if viewed as a kiddies movie, it is very entertaining. That's where the problem lies for this film, it isn't because it is a crappy film, it is because George Lucas made this film not realizing that the kids who ardored Star Wars are now adults. Jar Jar Binks is basically a comic relief to entertain the kids but the adults didn't digest him too well. Plus most of the acting seemed wooden because they were mostly performed in a blue screen. This film shows how rusty George lucas is at directing because the film has bad pacing. It starts of as action, then it slows down, then goes up, then down, then up, you get the idea. Most of the fans of Star Wars feel that this film didn't possess the spirit of the previous films and it was all about marketing. They aren't far off. George Lucas should get better with episode 2. I feel in the future fans will look fondly back at this movie and Jar Jar Binks.Premise: A trade federation threatens to ruin the Star Wars universe.Episode 1 was nominated for three Academy awards and won a Razzie for worst supporting actor (Jar Jar Binks).Grade: 6.5/10 (Good kiddies movie).",9,0,1,2 May 2002
Fight Club," Anarchy at its best
","Pros: Cinematography, Directing, acting, memorable characters, Humor.Cons: Gets a bit too incredulous, violent.Fight club represents what will happen if anarchy is prevalent in our society. Thankfully this situation doesn't happen in real life. Ed Norton plays an insomniac who tries to get closure by attending Help groups such as AA even though he doesn't have any of the diseases the member of the groups have. Helena Bonham Carter disrupts his life when she does the same thing he is doing. Unable to go on with her hanging around, he and his alter-ego (Brad Pitt) decide to form Fight Club, a club for men who are fed up with thier lives. The club soon graduates to weekly boxing matches to terrorist activities and eventually gets too big for Norton to control. One of the best movies of 1999, Fight club is a satire on society that is both brutal and true in its findings. Premise: An insomniac finds escape through fight club.Fight club was nominated for a sole Academy award.Grade: 9.1/10 (Fincher's second best).",9,0,1,1 May 2002
Akira," Highly intellectual cartoon
","Pros: Animation, score, directing.Cons: Storyling gets very confusing at times, need to have an understanding of japanese culture to get this.The film Akira centers around a motocycle gang and the Government. The setting is Neo-Tokyo which is an urban hellhole where rival biker gangs race the streets seeking and causing destructions. Our hero Kaneda, who is also the leader of the bike gang, is out with his buddies where he meets up with a rival gang called the clowns and they have a little gang war. While this is happening, there is a strange man and equally strange kid walking around a student riot. The story is confusing to tell because there is a lot of subplots going on. Akira, as the title is called is apparantly a boy who has this energy capable of explaining the universe. The film boasts better animation than Disney has even till today and is sometimes shockingly but refreshingly violet. My quibble with this film is that the last 30 minutes are about as wierd as anything out there. I am no expert at mangas but how come everyone i  watch always has to have some giant blob reeking havoc (Mononoke, Metropolis, e.t.c). This film has been called a classic by many and watching the animation u can see why, but the story is one big overbundled mess that tries to get philosophical. Not better than The Fist Of The North Star or any of the Dragon ball series in my opinion but quite goodPremise: A Biker gang leader and his girlfriend tries to stop a manical super-human with the help of three superhumans.Akira won a Screen Scream Award at the Amsterdam Film festivalGrade: 7.2/10 (Good but not my cup of tea).",7,0,2,4 October 2002
12 Monkeys," Gilliam's view of Madness
","Pros: Directing, sets, cinematography.Cons: Muddled, very confusing, feels too close to Brazil.Terry Gilliam's new film is about a virus which will wipe out the people on earth and a man sent from the future to save us all. This reads like Terminator 2: Judgement day but this movie is far from it. First of all, Bruce Willis is human, and second of all, when he time-travels, things don't go smootly as the terminator. Willis keeps us guessing whether his character is really from the future or one of those people you meet at the streets proclaiming the end of the world. Brad pitt plays a animal right activists whose character is basically limited to incoherent babbling and Madeline Stowe plays a psychaitrist who is a kindred spirit to Sam Lowry. Gilliam uses bookend technique to begin and end the film and this provides for two very ingenious twists. Much better than the fisher king and Baron Munchausen, Gilliam would later fall from grace with Fear and Loathing but that's another review.Premise: Willis is sent to save the world from a deadly virus.Twelve monkeys was nominated for two Academy awards.Grade: 8/10 (Gilliam is back on track).",8,0,1,2 May 2002
Batman Returns," Best in the series.
","Pros: Sets, directing, humor, characters, costumes, score, action sequences.Cons: A bit dark at times, last 20 minutes ludicrous at times.Batman returns, Tim Burton's follow up to the 1989 blockbuster screams his trademark directing. Burton got more control over the production and the result is a fantastic film even thought the studio execs and the public didn't like it. Danny Devito is manical as the penguin, Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy as catwoman and Micheal Keaton returns as batman. Christopher Walken as Max Shreck nearly steals the show and Elfman's score is basically the same from the last movie except for the choir he used. Gotham city is much darker and this film looks like it cost more. The batmobile is featured more and the action sequences are outstanding. The ending gets a bit ridiculous but not enough to bring the whole film down. One of the best blockbusters of the 90's.Premise: Batman battles the Penguin and Catwoman.Batman returns was nominated for two Academy awards and a Razzie award.Grade: 9.2/10  (The best of the series).",9,1,2,3 May 2002
Ed Wood," Tribute to a legend, or not
","Pros: Cinematography, script, characters, humor.Cons: Not entirely accurate.Ed Wood is Tim Burton's tribute to the worst director of all time. This is probably Burton's most personal and best film. The film stars Johnny Depp as Ed wood, a cross dressing director whose hero is Orson Welles. Martin Landau plays Bela Lugosi, who befriends Wood in his last years. Most of the exploits are true but I am not sure that's the way Ed Wood acted. The script is spot on and never falters under its own silliness. The cinematography of black and white gives an authentic feel to the movie as that was the way the real wood filmed his films. Most of the characters the real Ed wood hung around in real life are all present here. Initially a box-office failure, Ed wood is often very funny and a delight to watch. It shows Tim Burton at his best.Premise: Ed wood tries to make Plan 9 from outer space.Ed wood won two Academy awards. One for Landau's portrayal as Bela Lugosi and another for the makeup.Grade: 10/10 (Classic Burton)",10,0,0,3 May 2002
L.A. Confidential," Film-Noir about hollywood scandals
","Pros: Characters, Cinematography, Script, Directing, Costumes. Cons: Hardly any.1997 was a good year for movies as movies such as Boogie nights, Good Will Hunting and Titanic premiered. The best of the bunch though is this gem of a movie which follows three cops throughout hollywood. Kevin Spacey plays a cop who is in search for personal glory, Russell Crowe plays the second cop who is just used for his skills in bullying people but the real star of the film is Guy Pearce who plays a cop who does the job for personal duty. James Cromwell plays one of the most memorable villians in years and Kim Basinger gives her character beauty and depth. Deservedly, she won her oscar for this role. Great scoring by Jerry Goldsmith, one of my favourite scorists.Premise: Three cops must put differences aside and join forces to solve a crime.L.A Confidential was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won two.Grade: 10/10 (One of the best film-noirs)",10,1,2,1 May 2002
Glory," White or Black man's Glory?
","Pros: Cinematography, Directing, Score, Costumes, Fight scenes, Acting Cons: Not told from company's view, stereotypical characters, historical inaccuracies, Broderick looks youngBrilliantly directed by Zwick, Glory is one of the best movies of the eightees. This film feels like a personal film to all involved in it. Gloroius battle scenes and cinematography and it cost only 18 million dollars to make. The Journey of Denzel Washington and the whole company is a fascinating one that will leave you crying, laughing and then finally cheering for them.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," a film for all time
","When i went to the cinema to see the lord of the rings, i was expecting a run-of-the-mill fantasy movie like harry potter. what i got was an entertainment joyride in the palm of director peter jackson. the acting was great, the action sequences were among the best ever filmed and the graphics excellent. my only quibble was that it wasn't long enough but hopefully the DVD will take care of that. 9/10 stars",9,0,0,16 January 2002
Armageddon," Awful yarn about the end of the world
","Pros: Special effects, sound, cinematography.Cons: Unbelievable situations, laughable dialogue, hammy acting, slovenly direction.Armageddon is referred in the bible as the end of the world. This new film calls itself that because an asteroid the size of texas is about to hit the Earth and end life. The movie is so far fetched it just comes of as cheesy. first of all, the fate of the Earth will not fall to a bunch of miners. The asteroid is not even in proportion to the ship. It certainly doesn't take one nuke to split an asteroid the size of Texas. Bay directs this horrible movie full of bad writing ('He's pretty much the smartest man in the planet') and he doesn't know when to stop. Bad acting exudes from Liv Tyler and Buscemi is slumming for the paycheck. Ben Affleck is still convinced that Jerry Bruckheimer is going to make him a star but this film isn't the star-making vehicle he expects to get. Bay shows he really doesn't know how to direct a big budject flick and he should go back to small independent films.Premise: An asteriod the size of texas has a collision course to Earth.Armageddon was nominated for four Academy awards all on the technical side. Nominated and won numerous Razzies.GradeL: 1.5/10 (Surprisingly not Bay's worst)",1,1,3,1 May 2002
American Psycho," Makes Bret Easton Ellis' novel accessible
","Pros: Sets, Black humor, Cinematography.Cons: Lack of characterization from minor characters, Gratuitous violence and sex, needs repeated viewings to get the humor.American psycho is a satire for eighties greed based on the novel of the same name. Folks, Christian Bale probably gives one of the best performances of that year as the psychopathic banker Patrick Bateman. Most people hated this movie because they felt the main character was a jerk and was mean to women. But if dissected carefully, you begin to find out that patrick bateman is really just an end product to reaganism. For example, evidence is given in the movie that most of the violence is imagined in bateman's head and he really imagines himself committing crimes but cannot bring himself to actually do it. Also he is never shown working so one can be skeptical in his role in the office and whether he is really important. Plus, he always has his name mistakened for another coworker by another character and this leads to some funny situations. Marry harron does a good job of directing this anti-female novel and Guinevere Turner has to be given kudos for adapting a difficult movie. The real praise should be lavished on Christian bale as he personifies Patrick Bateman. Loaded with unintentional( or intentional) black humor, this is one of the funniest movies of the year. With such classic lines as 'I had to kill a lot of people' and memorable scenes, American psycho never gets stale with repeated viewing. Some people have complained about the last thirty minutes but I think it is important to showing just how much of a psycho bateman really is. His friends, although make brief appearances are hilarious and some of the imagined murders do nothing but bring laughter to your facePremise: Patrick Bateman is wanted in the connection of the death of Paul Allen, a coworker.American Psycho received no Academy awards but got critical Kudos.Grade: 10/10 (American masterpiece)",10,1,2,1 May 2002
Dark City," Feels like the Matrix somehow
","Pros: Special effects, score, directing, script, sets.Cons: Kiefer sutherland, feels a bit rushed.Dark City by Alex Proyas is one of the best sc-fi films of the nineties. Rufus Sewell plays a murderer (or not) who can remember anything about his life except Shell Beach, where he grew up from. He discovers that he has an unusual gift and at midnight, everyone seems to fall asleep. This film is similar to the matrix because like the matrix the humans here are slaves and unaware to thier prison. But unlike the matrix, the mood is darker (always at night except at the end) and it plays like a film noir. One would say it is almost like the Thirteenth Floor, another excellent sci-fi film. The themes explored in Dark City are the same ones explored in BLADE RUNNER, what makes us human?. The alien race are very scary in thier appearance especially the kid whose only line is 'Kill him'. Jennifer Conelly plays Sewell's love interest and William Hurt plays a cop after Rufus Sewell. Kiefer Sutherland plays a pyschiatrist who works for the alien race and wants to help Sewell develop his gift. The twist at the end is one of the most scary in recent years and only matched by the Sixth Sense.Premise: Rufus Sewell must find out who is chasing him, why he is wanted for murders, why he cannot remember anything and what's the deal with Shell Beach.Dark City was not nominated for any Academy awards but won the Saturn award for best science fiction movie.Grade: 10/10 (A sci-fi classic).",10,0,2,2 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," Flag waving at its worst
","Pros: Cinematography, Costumes, Sound, Special effects.Cons: Historical innacuracies, Hammy acting, Sloppy directing, Unbelievable characters.Pearl Harbor represents everything bad a movie can get. It claims it was made for the veterans of pearl harbor but really it is a formulaic blockbuster whose purpose it seems was to beat Titanic at the box office. Ben Affleck thought this was the film that would make him a star after Armageddon failed to do so. The only star this film made was Josh Hartnett. The Girls including Kate Benkinsale were basically downgraded to giggling schoolgirls and the guys I guess was how every military men in thier days concucted themselves. I mean, who in the H**l gets drunk, wakes up the morning of the attack, flies a plane and shoots down enemy japanese planes, gives blood after the ordeal, then gets picked for the doolittle raid. This is physically impossible. Cuba Gooding Jr gets relegated to a token black guy's role and Jon Voight portrayal as Franklin Roosevelt is downright corny. The story isn't even told in the Japanese point of view and why did they have to show the doolittle raid. History shows that it was nothing but a morale booster for america. In fact the pilots hit nothing but hospitals and schools. Hollywood doesn't trust the audience to figure out that we won the war instead of the japanese so they decide to end the movie on a good note. At least if you dedicate this peice of dreck to the veterans, the least you can do is show at least 1/20 of the death's of thousands of americans who died on this day. The love story seems like something that would come out of Jerry Springer.Premise: Group of friends experience disaster at Pearl Harbor.Pearl harbor was nominated for four Academy awards and won one.Grade: 1.2/10 (Bay's worst)",1,0,2,1 May 2002
Tigerland," Good pre-vietnam flick
","Pros: Directing, acting, script.Cons: A bit too grapic in some sex scenes, cliched characters.Tigerland is Joel Schumacher's return from grace after the dismal Batman & Robin. Colin Farrell plays private Bozz who decides he will do anything to get kicked out of the army. No matter how hard he tries, he still doesn't get kicked out and even gets promoted. Tigerland generally follows a platoon through bootcamp. It brings back memories from the first part of Full Metal Jacket as the drill instructors are as hard as they come. Tigerland is important because it showed the feeling of frustration americans felt during the vietnam war. Buzz is a good soilder, even his superiors recognize it but he feels that the war is pointless and really just wants to be in Mexico.He becomes some sort of a hero to the squadron and he helps some of his counterparts escape the war, plus he makes a dangerous adversary while still in bootcamp. In the end, Bozz accepts his fate and would rather see himself die than see another person take his place. Joel essentially films this with a limited budjet so it feels like a homemade film.Premise: Recruits go through basic training in infamous tigerland.Tigerland was ignored by the Academy awards but was nominated for numerous Independent awardsGrade: 9/10 (One of the best vietnam flicks).",9,0,0,2 May 2002
Mission: Impossible II," Vanity show for Cruise
","Pros: Action sequences.Cons: Score, overexposure of cruise, tries to be like James Bond.After the brilliant Mission Impossible, the series has taken a turn for the worse under the helm of John Woo. Cruise fans should love this movie because he is basically in almost every scene and always smiling. In the first film he acted, this one he basically just flashes his smile, what's up with that. The script is nonexistent and how many times do we really need a face-change sequence. John Woo has recently had a bad streak since he came to hollywood and this is his worst film. Cruise doesn't even assemble a team when he captures Thandy Newton, he basically does it himself. Ving Rhames who was good in the first film feels like his role is basically a cameo. This film has lost its roots from the television show and instead wants to be like James Bond. Thandie Newton is basically eye-candy, she isn't even needed for her skills as a thief but instead for her skills at seducing. Dougray Scott is a bad villian. What the h**l happened to the brilliant score of Danny Elfman, instead the score is rocked-up. The only saving grace of this movie is the motorcycle sequences. The fight scenes between Scott and Cruise is lethargic at best and seems like a fight out of WWF smackdown. Who cares about Chymera and Belereform. Hopefully Fincher can save the series.Premise: Hunt must stop a deadly virus.Mission: Impossible 2 was not nominated for an Academy award but it won MTV awards and was nominated for Razzies.Grade: 4/10 (Horrible).",4,0,1,2 May 2002
Mission: Impossible," Mission accomplished
","Pros: Directing, score, action sequences, brilliant script.Cons: Lacks character development from other big name stars, his first team die rather quickly.This is one of the best spy movies ever. Although it was nominated for a Razzie as one of the worst written films, the script is its strenght. Basically Tom Cruise (Ethan Hunt) has been framed for the murders of his colleagues and for being under the employment of max, an arms dealer. Cruise decides to work for max to find out who frames him and this results to one of the best scripts of the year. There are basically no plot holes and you need required viewing to see it. Danny Elfman's score is basically his best since Dick Tracy. It has memorable scenes, for example Tom Cruise hanging inside the Black Vault. The last 20 minutes has to be basically one of the most exciting in recent years. Most critics hated this movie but it gets better with age and repeated viewing. Kudos has to go to Brian De Palma for his fancy camera work and directing. The twist in the end is brilliant and Jon Voight is a fantastic villian. My favourite character in the movie has to be Gene Kittridge. Emmanuelle Beart fans hate this movie because she is basically there as eye candy for the guys. Premise: Ethan Hunt must find out who framed him.Mission: Impossible was not nominated for any Academy awards but it won a PGA golden laurel awards and was nominated for numerous MTV awards.Grade: 10/10 (Action packed spy classic)",10,1,3,2 May 2002
Pulp Fiction," Brilliant
","Pros: Memorable scenes, memorable characters, humor, score.Cons: At times too violent, a lot of swear words used.Critics were split in 1994 deciding what was the best picture that year. Mordern classics such as the Shawshank Redemption, Quiz Show, Forrest Gump, and Pulp fiction marked thier debut. The best, according to the Academy Awards was Gump but the true masterpeice that year was Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction was  genre defying as is influenced other movies and filmakers notably Paul Thomas Anderson and Guy Ritchie though they haven't been able to top Quentin Tarantino's Brillian film. The best 'story' will have to be the one following Bruce Willis as a boxer who does anything to get back his watch. We know the watch is important as there is a rather lenghty and funny narrative of how the watch comes to the hand of Willis. Other memorable characters are portrayed by Samuel Jackson, Quentin Tarantino, Uma thurman and John Travolta.Premise: Four stories joined over a period of two days featuring druggies, cleaners, mobsters, boxers and a few other shady characters.Pulp fiction was nominated for seven academy awards and won only one for screen writing. Won the Palm'D or at the cannes film festival.Grade: 10/10 (Tarantino's best)",10,1,2,1 May 2002
Titanic," Best epic of 90's
","Pros: Directing, Special effects, Score, Kate winslet Cons: Turns to melodrama at the endNot the best film of that year(LA Confidential takes that title) but the best epic of the 90's. James Cameron's 200 million dollar tale is both epic in size and intimate and Cameron provides wonderful directing and pacing for the film. Often named the most popular film in history, it broke box office records held by jurassic park due in part to the leading man Leonardo di Caprio. Cameron's film starts out slow but once the ship hits the iceberg, it's nonstop action till the end. Kate winslet character seems a bit spoilt and billy zane is unbelievable but these are minor quibbles to an otherwise terrific filmPremise: Film details the fate of several passengers in the maiden and only voyage of the titanic.Titanic was nominated for fourteen academy awards and won 11.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Way better than Fellowship
","pros: Costumes, score, directing, acting, script, special effects, cast.Cons: None.In a time where movies that generate unusually amounts of hype are usually the bad ones, Harry Potter not only exceeded my expectations, it shattered them. I was floored with this movie. Till this day why it didn't win any oscars or at least get nominated for best film I will never know. My only theory is that it was a British Film as the only main individual who was involved in it that wasn't british was Chris Columbus. plus Spielberg must have been hurting by the major diss. Most people I watch it with complain that it is too slow but that is the beauty of this film. It doesn't rush you into the world of Harry Potter but instead usually accompanies you, showing u wonders a little at a time much like the book. Other have said it is too faithful to the book. All I can say to them is that you haven't read the book. trust me folks a lot of stuff was aken out, particularly the beginning. What sets Harry Potter away from other films that year was the script and acting. Anytime I saw Radgliffe, Grinch, and Watson at screen together a smile came to my face.The elder all star cast was even better. For example as Hermoine would say, one of the classic scenes in this movie would be the troll scene. Professor quirell comes running in and shouts 'troll in the dungeon, thought u ought to know' then he faints. Instead of an immediate reaction, about 2 seconds is given for the thought to reach the students, then they all start screaming, I always laugh at that scene everytime. ALthough lenghty sometimes, it has enough wonders to keep you through. Some of the effects are quite spectacular like Fluffy and the Quidditch match. That has to rate as one of my all time best cinematic moments. Was really excels in this movie is Chris Columbus directing. My God he was great. Perfect balance of action, suspense, mystery and he really helped the kids get their act together so to speak. The score was brilliant. From now on John Williams should be scoring every project in Hollywood rather than that once good-turned hack Elfman.It isn't a mystery why this movie became the second highest grossing movie of all time even thought it had a 21/2 hr running period. I can't seem to stop watching this movie and will probably watch it again right after I am done typing this review. Probably my second all time favourite movie next to Dick Tracy.Premise: Harry, Hermoine and Ron have adventures in Hogwarts while Quirell tries to get the scorcerer's stone.Harry Potter was nominated for numerous prestigious awards including three oscars but sadly won very few of them.Grade:10/10 (As Roeper and Ebert put it, 'The wizard of Oz of its time'.",10,0,0,4 October 2002
Psycho," Classic Hitchcock
","Pros: Janet leigh, Cinematography, Directing, Score.Cons: Janet leigh is in only half the movie.Psycho isn't Hitchcock's best movie (the honor belongs to rear window) but probably the master of suspense most suspenseful and ultimately scary. Janet leigh plays a secretary who steals for the sake of her boyfriend and is on the run from the law. She happens upon the bates motel and is promptly murdered before the night is done. Bernard herrmann provides a masterful score matched by hitchcock's camera work. Hitchcock's movies tends to have a twist and psycho is probably the best out of all his movies. Only vertigo comes close. Anthony Perkins should have won an oscar for his portrayal of Norman Bates as he is the real star of the film. It gets a bit corny at the end.Premise: The death of a young woman leads to an investigation into the bates motel.Psycho was nominated for four Academy awards and is a winner of the AFI top 100 movies.Grade: 9.7/10 (One of the best thrillers of all time)",9,1,1,1 May 2002
Rosemary's Baby," The best horror film
","Pros: Comedy, Directing, Score, Script.Cons: None.Rosemary's baby is probably the best horror film ever made and it doesn't use any of nowaday's horror bag of tricks to scare you. The chills generated from this movie is genuine not manufactured as you will genuinely want to know what will become of rosemary. Rosemarry is played beautifully by Mia Farrow and the part of Guy is played to a tee by John Cassavetes as he puts on a facade on rosemary claiming not to know what she is really carrying. Ruth Gordon won an oscar deservedly as her potrayal of Minnie, the nosy neighbor who cares just a little bit too much for rosemary. In the end, Rosemary's decision is understandable because she has gone through a lot with her baby and she can bring herself to kill him even though he is the antichrist.Premise: Rosemary wonders if her baby is the Antichrist.Rosemary's baby was nominated for two Academy awards and won one.Grade: 10/10 (Perfect)",10,2,4,1 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," ***1/2/4
","Pros: Great battle scenes, good score and directing.Cons: A bit too long, too many conclusions.Jackson's trilogy comes to a close with this nearly 4 hr spectacle (which is exceeded with the special edition) that serves as a great closer to the entire epic. Loose ends are tied and multiple conclusions are handled in a way that will please both casual viewers and fans. This outing is the best out of the lot, and Jackson proves that the third time is a charm after a somewhat lackluster second outing. For once, Howard Shore's score does not disappoint and the actions scenes aroused me for the first time since the troll sequence in film one. Did the movie deserve to win every Oscar it was nominated for? Yes, for it was recognition for what the filmmakers had accomplished with all three films, and no, for the fact that it wasn't the best movie of the year.Conclusion: Great but Jackson can do better",8,1,2,15 February 2006
The Matrix," Perception vs Reality

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Space opera
","Pros: Special effects, directing, sets, script, score, acting.Cons: A bit slow at times, pacing problems.There is probably a million reviews of Star Wars floating on the web so one more isn't going to make a difference. Still, I'll add my little insignificant bitof o[inion of this movie. It is a classic movie, no doubt but surprisingly not the best in the series. Most fans seem to think the title belongs to The Empire Strikes Back and I agree with them. The film starts with a rebel ship trying to escape a epublic battleship to to no success. Princess Leia is onboard and she has structural plans of the infamous Death Star. Fearing capture, she transmits her info to R2-D2, a droid and also a message to Ben Kenobi. R2-D2 and along with C-3P0 escape through the use of an escape pod and they land on Tatooine, a desert planet. From there an epic journey begins involving different characters of all sorts. The robots provide much of the comic relief and Han Solo's biting sarcastic remarks are a riot to witness. His interactions with Chewbacca and Princess Leia provide for the funniest parts of the movie. The movie ultimately suffers because it seems a bit slow at times. For example, a lot of time is spent on the capture of the droids by the sandpeople and the eventual selling of them to Owen Lars. I felt this could be sped up a bit. The film finishes epic in scale and equally impressive with the use of digital effects. It is easy to see why this film became a landmark to its generation.  Premise: A rebellion threatens to knock out the Death Star, the most powerful weapon in the universe.Star Wars Episode 1: A New Hope was nominated for eleven Academy awards and won seven.Grade: 9.5/10 (One of the best Science Fiction films ever made).",9,0,0,8 May 2002
The Thin Red Line," Epic poetic yawn about guadalcanal
","Pros: cinematography, acting, directing, script.Cons: Dull, unrealistic action sequences.The Thin Red line tries to show the horrors of war using the poetic side. This is a good idea but it is executed rather badly because you have tough U.S soilders spewwing poetry as good as Lord Byron. This film is a masterpiece, because it is better than most of the films out there so it deserves some kudos trying to bring originality into our boring miserable lives, or that's what the director likes to think. It basically pay no respects to war veterans and is extremely anti-war. A film like Das Boot is anti-war but at least it pays respect to veterans by showing realistic submarine combat. The explosions in this movie look very fake and it glorifies a combat-dodger (James Cavaziel). Critics who think this movie is a classic either 1) have never seen combat in a war, or 2) too respectful of Mr Terrence Malick to actually tell him he made a bad movie. Look out for lots of cameos. Premise: Soilders and Captains ponder the significance of war.The Thin Red Line was nominated for seven Academy awards.Grade: 5/10 (Awful).",5,1,2,2 May 2002
Jackie Brown," ***/4
","Good Tarantino movie, not as good as pulp fiction but better than resevoir dogs. Stars Pam Grier as a down and out flight attendant who will do anything to change her luck for a better life. Robert DeNiro was especially funny in this movie and Bridget Fonda was looking especially sexy in this one. A scene involving them beginning in a shopping mall and ending in a parking lot had me sidesplitting in laughter. The score was really good but I had a few problems with the script which relied on too much chance to get things going. Also Pam Grier's character I really had no sympathy for her because all of her problems were caused by HER decisions not by the cruel hand of fate. Anyway the directing is outstanding and so is the acting so i gave this one a good scorePros: Acting, comedic situatons, score, directingCons: Script, themes.Bottom line: With tarantino you can always expect above average or better, this one was good.",8,0,1,10 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the series
","Pros: Script, story, special effects, characterization, costumes, duels.Cons: Ends on a downer.With the Empire Strikes Back, director Irvin Kirshner brings a veteran hand to the film, and therefore more characterization and a better script which ultimately makes this the best Star Wars film so far. Since A New Hope, Luke Skywalker has become commander of the rebel airforce and Han Solo has joined in the fight to escape the wrath of Jabba the Hutt. Darth Vader has become obsessed with finding Luke because, well it will be expalined later on in the film. The Empire Strikes Back was made three years after Star Wars so it features better special effects and the ILM team really outdid themselves with this one. The special effects are just amazing to look at. Equally impressive are the costumes, the creatures and the puppetry involved with this one. Fans of the Star Wars series like this film because two major secrets are revealed to them. What this film lacks though is a major space battle as it ends with the fans wondering if the faith of Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, Solo, the robot units and the rebels will be good. Irvin Kirshner is obviously good at bringing out emotions from the audience and he is pretty capable of staging a good light saber duel.Premise: The empire seek to crush the rebels and Darth hopes to convert young Skywalker to the dark force.The Empire Strikes Back was nominated for four Academy awards and won two.Grade: 10/10 (Best Science Fiction film of the eighties).",10,0,1,8 May 2002
