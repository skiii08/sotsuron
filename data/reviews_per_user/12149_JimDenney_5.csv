Casablanca," Casablanca
","Casablanca is a 1942 romantic drama directed by Michael Curtiz, but the strength of the film is that classification does not entirely do it justice. The story could also be called a war movie, even though there isn't any traditional war action and has a film noir feel at times.The film stars Humphrey Bogart as Rick and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. There is some terrific dialog and many famous lines, such as when Rick toasts Ilsa saying 'Here's looking at you, kid'. Delivered perfectly of course.The cinematography is excellent, and I thought the filming of the scenes inside the bar were very impressive. The lighting was very interesting, with some film noir style lighting at times. Bergman was often filmed with a very gauzy look, but it was subtle, in fact it was beautiful, but it didn't distract from the film. The music is perfection, and is the acting.I need to see this again as I am sure I missed a lot as the story is a little complex and there is a lot going on on screen.",9,0,1,13 May 2015
Taxi Driver," Hero, villain, or just nuts?
","I loved Taxi Driver. Great acting, cinematography and an ending that gets you thinking, and there is no right answer. Is Travis Bickle a hero, villain, or just nuts? What did the ending signify? I suspect this a movie that you could watch every 5 years or so and maybe come to a different conclusion as your perspective and society changes. This is what makes this a timeless movie. Travis was a Vietnam war veteran and we have veterans today struggling to integrate into society. To me he is a hero in that he is trying to do the right thing, but he is going a bit nuts in how he lives his life and what he sees as a taxi driver in seedy NYC.",9,1,3,13 May 2015
Annie Hall," Quirky movie, great dialog
","First off, while I'm not necessarily a Woody Allen fan historically, I'm trying to take a fresh approach going forward as I really enjoyed Blue Jasmine. As part of class we watched Annie Hall, which I hadn't seen before. Even though quirky movies typically aren't my thing, I enjoyed it, and seeing young Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum (very brief cameo) was kinda cool. The dialog was very funny at times, in a chuckle not bell laugh kind of way. The movie makes you wonder how two people can ever really stay together. After all we all have our issues and Alvy and Annie certainly have theirs! In the end, as in many relationships, hopefully you can appreciate and love the person, even if you are no longer in love with them.",6,0,0,13 May 2015
The Graduate," great film, not a fan of the ending
","I have seen The Graduate before, but many years ago. The music, cinematography, dialog, and story are all compelling.Mrs. Robinson's seduction of Ben is classic and brilliantly written, filmed and performed. Those scenes you could watch over and over again and pickup (no pun intended) so many details missed during prior viewings.The social significance is varied; the older women/younger man, generational differences, social expectations, the impact of reaching middle age and the emotional immaturity of youth all collide here. Unfotunately, the ending is unrealistic, hurried and just doesn't do it for me, but everything before that certainly does.",8,0,0,13 May 2015
Singin' in the Rain," not a fan of musicals, but I'm a fan of Singin'
","I'm not much of a fan of musicals, but I'm a fan of Singin' in the Rain! Most musicals I find either boring, forced, or both. Either the music and dancing is forced into the story or the story is forced into the music and dancing. Not with this film. It all flows together and packs quite a punch. The music and choreography are excellent and then when you add in the story, dialog and comedic elements you get a truly wonderful experience. The acting and comedic elements are intertwined with two story lines, the transition from silent films to talkies, but also evolving relationship between Don Lockwood and Kethy Selden. This a must see film!",9,0,2,13 May 2015
