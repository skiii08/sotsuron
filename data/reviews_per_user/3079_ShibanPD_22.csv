Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the Lost Ark
","In 1981, the stars aligned over Hollywood, and the greatest adventure movie of all time was born, from one of the greatest movie collaborations of all time. Leave it to Hollywood to turn a prosaic, meticulous scientific endeavor like archaeology into a spectator sport; the opening action sequence finds the film's hero, after capturing the object of his mission, cradling it like a football and sprinting like a halfback out of the buried site of ruins, dodging booby-trapped poison darts all the way. The premise of Raiders of the Lost Ark is credited to the creative genius of George Lucas, who somehow hit upon the idea of replacing an academic profession marked by a slow, gradual pursuit of truths about human prehistory with a romantic, mercenary endeavor, in which the practitioners are pirates in a high-speed, cutthroat, competitive race for buried treasures that have been buried for thousands of years. One of those pirates is now one of the most recognizable movie heroes of all time. Like Superman, Indiana Jones maintains a mild manner in his day job and dons iconic garb to pursue his true passion. Instead of reporting, Jones teaches at university; instead of fighting crime, he risks life and limb to unearth important historical artifacts, which he sells to museums. Like the various eras of remote history imprinted into the living rocks, layer upon layer, Raiders was developed through an escalating application of movie talents. Lucas's idea developed into a perfectly understated screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan, became fully realized under the stylish, high-energy direction of Steven Spielberg, and achieved legendary status through a star-making performance by Harrison Ford and a film-score masterwork by composer John Williams. Jones, as played by Ford and directed by Spielberg, is slightly more than a hero, but well short of a superhero. His face is unshaven. He sweats. He looks like he hasn't showered in days, and he probably has bad breath. When he first steps into the light in South America, he is still in the shadows. When he swings from a vine, and we first hear his heroic theme, he falls and plops into the water, well short of the amphibious airplane that rescues him from pursuing natives. And when he gets into the getaway plane, he is met with the pilot's pet snake, which we learn Jones hates. This is a real man, with real vulnerabilities. John Williams' musical soundtrack aside, Raiders sounds astoundingly good, as exemplified by the scene in Nepal, where Jones meets Toht, the most sinister of his Nazi enemies, and Marion, the most important of his allies. From start to finish, Raiders is virtually non-stop action and intrigue, infused with humor, and polished with a touch of romance. It is a treasure hunt over three thousand years in the making, the object of which—the Ark of the Covenant—adds a spiritual, mystical dimension to a film that otherwise follows a standard action/adventure story arc. And although the end can be criticized for its 'deus ex machina' resolution, it is the end that gives the film its soul. God in Raiders is interventionist and vengeful, and He punishes the Nazis and their accomplices for disturbing the vessel that held the tablets on which were written the Ten Commandments—the Covenant—which they have broken through their evil ways. Indy and Marion are spared, not just because they are good, but because Indy knows not to look. It's all part of a strange archaeological and religious folklore that somehow makes sense within the context of the movie, and somehow fits in with the film's Saturday matinée, Summer blockbuster appeal.",Null,0,0,12 November 2012
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
","With E.T., the Spielberg/Williams collaboration reaches an overwhelming crescendo. Story points, emotion, and music are perfectly synchronized, and symphonic mastery blends seamlessly with crystalline directorial vision. Spielberg demonstrates a real aptitude for directing child actors, evincing genuine fright, sadness, and love. Realistic childlike senses of humor, wonder, and adventure empower the young main characters to guide us on a supremely entertaining ride. Writer Melissa Mathison makes bold, strong, beautiful choices in her characterizations and thematic development. She tells the story from the point of view of the children, but never completely vilifies the adults. In the scene leading up to E.T.'s 'death,' the doctors working on the creature try their hardest to save him and are visibly distraught when it appears they are unable to keep him alive, despite Elliott's accusative remark, 'Look at what they've done to you.' The title character is a wondrous amalgamation of various forms of 'the other'—those companions, projections, and creations of the human mind—other beings that fill the void when ordinary adult human beings just don't cut it. E.T. is, at once, an alien, a god, a superhero, a pet, and a child. Even to Elliott and Gertie, who are themselves children, E.T. is like a child, and they are able to teach him things. Like a faithful dog, E.T. feels what Elliott feels. Yet, somehow E.T. also assumes a magisterial presence; he exhibits supernatural powers and serves as a 'savior' of sorts, distracting Elliott and his siblings from the pain of divorce. When Elliott thinks that E.T. is dead, he makes him something resembling a religious promise: 'I'll believe in you all my life.' It is a rare movie that can make children and adults alike feel so strongly for an alien creature whose eyes are said to have been patterned on Einstein's and whose voice was partially supplied by a chain-smoking 70-year-old woman. It is an even rarer movie that can make the hearts of its viewers long achingly for that same alien title character to find his way 'home'—while, at the same time, ache wistfully when they realize that he can't 'stay.'",Null,0,0,11 November 2012
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb
","Dr. Strangelove bounces from one brilliant comic duo to the next. RAF Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers) plays sidekick to General Jack T. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), who starts it all off by launching a nuclear attack on the Russians, who he thinks are trying to sap and impurify all of his precious bodily fluids. The supremely British Captain Mandrake tries desperately to retrieve the recall code from the crazy cowboy General Ripper, and Ripper tries to get Mandrake to help him fight the troops sent to disarm him with insanely funny ruses like telling him that the 'Redcoats are coming.' When the crew of one of the bombers that Ripper has sent against Russia informs the pilot, Major Kong (Slim Pickens), of their attack orders, Kong tells them to stop 'horsing around on the airplane.' General Turgidson's recurring repartee with his 'secretary' Miss Scott (Tracy Reed) comes to a humorous head when she calls him in the war room, and he advises her to say her prayers. President Muffley (Sellers again), who is dependent on Turgidson (George C. Scott) for information on the nuclear deterrence program that Muffley himself approved, grows more and more annoyed by Turgidson's less-than-humanitarian recommendations. When Muffley allows the Russian ambassador, Sadesky (Peter Bull), into the war room, Turgidson's distrust and disdain for his communist comrade breaks loose: 'He'll see everything! He'll see the big board!' President Muffley's phone conversation with Premier Kissoff is all kid gloves, failed pleasantries, and ego stroking; despite all the Cold War strategizing, we realize that the fate of the world rests on the ability of two men from opposite sides of the globe to earn mutual trust through personal communication. Meanwhile, Colonel 'Bat' Guano (Keenan Wynn) makes his way through Ripper's defenses to find Mandrake on the verge of cracking the recall code. When Mandrake tries to contact President Muffley on a pay phone, but doesn't have enough pocket change, he asks Guano to shoot open a vending machine, to which Guano warns: 'you're gonna have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company.' Finally, Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers, yet again), the imported scientist, has an outrageous slapstick routine with his alter ego, Dr. Strangelove, the Nazi, whose right arm takes on a life of its own. It becomes apparent, while watching the film, why the topic of all-out nuclear war offers itself, more than any other type of human conflict, to satire. It's the absurdity inherent in mankind's ability to destroy itself with the push of a button. And while the 'proper' handling of such material includes fear and terror of the prospect, and/or cold rationalizing about attack plans and post-apocalyptic survival tactics, the only sane reaction may just be to laugh hysterically at the horrific possibility.",Null,1,4,11 November 2012
Glory," Glory
","There are two kinds of war movie: those that field warriors who are compelled to fight by orders handed down to them from superiors who may or not have internalized the cause—thus reducing the cause to a localized mission of group survival (e.g., Black Hawk Down) or dissolving it into chaotic meaninglessness (e.g., Full Metal Jacket)—and those in which the fighters themselves have internalized the cause, thus heightening its significance and strengthening their resolve. I tend to prefer the latter kind, and Glory is one of the best of that kind. Narrated through the actual letters of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and beginning at the bloody Battle of Antietam, Glory tells the courageous, moving, true story of the first group of black soldiers enlisted to fight during the American Civil War—a war fought, in part, over the issue of slavery. Not every member of Shaw's unit is a slave. His friend since childhood, Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), is an educated, free man, who speaks as though he walked out of a Charles Dickens novel. For the most part, Thomas's tent mates—who include a wise, respectful father-figure, John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and a stuttering, wide-eyed optimist, Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy)—are agreeable and loyal, fully committed to the cause and eager to fight for freedom and glory. Of course, agreeableness and consensus make for dull drama. Enter Trip, played by Denzel Washington, who introduces dissension, first by referring to Thomas as 'Snowflake,' and then by stressing irreconcilable differences between whites and blacks, breaking ranks to retrieve better shoes, refusing to accept 'slave wages,' and eventually picking a fight with a whole regiment of white Union soldiers. One layer out from Trip's quarrel with the world, Shaw confronts a Union army that denigrates his regiment, refusing them necessary supplies and the opportunity to fight. Real battle with the Confederacy seems like a faraway notion. But it will come soon enough, after a bit of effective blackmail by Shaw and another of his boyhood friends, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), and the quelling of Trip's unproductive rebelliousness by Rawlins, as he points out that these white men Trip wants to brush aside are fighting, and dying, for him—that it's time for he and the rest of the 54th to 'ante up' and fight for themselves, now that they've been given the chance. Glory relies on a series of overlapping setups followed by payoffs, most of which work beautifully. The opening staging of Antietam drives home the close-range brutality of warfare with rifle and bayonet, so that Shaw's harsh, pedantic treatment of the sharpshooting Sharts seems warranted after Shaw witnesses his men laughing and playacting a battle with their newly issued weapons. The presentation of Shaw's timidity, even through his own admission, sets up his first moment of glory, when he finally confronts the Quartermaster and obtains much-needed shoes for his men. Shaw's firm treatment of Sharts sets up Sharts' moment of glory in the first battle, where he proves his ability to load and discharge his weapon to Shaw's standard. Thomas's degradation, by both Trip and the sharp-tongued Mulcahy (and, to a subtler extent, by Shaw), finds redemption in this same first battle, when he saves Trip from certain death. Finally, after twice refusing to carry the flag, Trip picks it up in the ending battle, upon Shaw's fall, and attempts to lead the final charge. Although our heroes perish in their failed attempt to take the fort, the true victory is written in the afterword: 180,000 black troops volunteered after learning of the bravery of the 54th. Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance in this movie is consistently, outstandingly brilliant, both from the perspective of character detail and emotional impact. In the scene in which Trip is whipped for 'deserting' the regiment, Washington summons the resiliency, defiance, pain, futility, and sorrow of generations of enslaved brothers and sisters, and expresses the anguish of their considerable plight against the frivolity of the 'punishment' at hand. And he does this without saying a word. James Horner's music, for this scene especially, as well as for the final battle scene, is magnificent. Edward Zwick's direction of the final battle and his handling, throughout the film, of camera, conflict, and character, is glorious. Why this movie wasn't nominated for Best Picture is beyond my comprehension. What is within my comprehension is my opinion that Glory was the best picture of 1989.",Null,0,0,11 November 2012
Fargo," Fargo
","There are two iconic shots toward the end of Fargo, both featuring Peter Stormare's character, the reticent, cold-blooded criminal-for-hire, Grimsrud. The first finds him reacting shockingly to the revelation on a daytime soap opera he's watching that one of the characters is pregnant. The second discovers him, as does the film's very pregnant heroine, Officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), forcing the leg of his newly deceased accomplice, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi), through a wood chipper. Both shots are emblematic of the film's continual interweaving of the humorous with the macabre, and both reveal how the black comedy of Fargo, which is as oddly frightening as it is gut-bustingly funny, is achieved. Grimsrud's intent reaction to the soap opera revelation occurs right next to the carelessly discarded, motionless body of his kidnapping victim, Jean Lundegaard, and right before Showalter bursts in with a bullet-torn face. Jean Lundegaard's likely murder and Carl Showalter's facial wound have both resulted from a botched scheme engineered by Jean's hapless husband, Jerry (William H. Macy). Jerry, who looks and speaks like a leprechaun, possesses the qualities of a leprechaun's evil twin; he is as unlucky as he is selfish and stupid. But he has the air of middle-class decency about him; earlier, he joins his wife in earnestly scolding their son for using foul language. Apart from a minor plot (he intends it to be a 'no-rough-stuff type deal') to kidnap his wife and collect the ransom from his father-in-law, Jerry appears to be the workingman head of a warm, happy household: close, comfy, and cozyâ€”much like the tube sock that still quirkily adorns Carl Showalter's foot, as the rest of his leg grinds its way down into the bloody, snowy abyss beneath the wood chipper. The disturbing violence in Fargo draws additional unsettlement because it disturbs representative objects and scenes of domesticity: soft, comfortable clothes, a routine traffic stop, a suburban parking garage, a housewife knitting while she watches a daytime talk show, and the most representative symbol of domesticity: a proclamation of pregnancy on a daytime soap opera. Like the slightly sub-standard American English dialect spoken by most of its characters and its slightly sub-classical Carter Burwell score, the Coen brothers' slightly off-center crime dramedy works beautifully; Fargo makes us laugh uncomfortably and cringe, as extraordinary crimes infringe on ordinariness. We cringe, but we don't look away; this film is extremely entertaining and, therefore, extremely, though disturbingly, watch-able (and re-watch-able).",Null,0,0,11 November 2012
North by Northwest," North by Northwest
","Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest strives to be thrilling, intriguing, comedic, and romantic—and it is; not a scene, not a moment in the film isn't played for a suspenseful or titillating thrill, a shocking twist, or a laugh—and, on most counts, it succeeds, guiltily as charged. Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive—a wise choice of occupation for a character who requires qualities that would make him initially mistakable for a government agent and the creativity and deceptiveness to eventually win the spy game, with and against real spies. Eva Marie Saint plays Eve Kendall, a woman who has entered the spy game after falling in love with a member of the wrong side and will labor to exit the game after she falls in love with a member of the right side: our good man Roger Thornhill. James Mason and Martin Landau play the smarmy bad guys who refuse to entertain the possibility that Thornhill could be anything other than a spy who currently goes by the name George Kaplan, even after a series of less-than-covert, bumbling moves. North by Northwest entertains more by ambition and suggestion than by complete delivery. There are cases when Bernard Herrmann's rousing, virtuosic score punctuates a moderately thrilling moment with supremely thrilling music, after the moment has nearly passed (e.g., the awkward collision and explosion that nearly ends the crop-duster scene), or suggests action that isn't as active as we would hope (e.g., the entire chase across the face of Mount Rushmore). Still, the film's ambition to constantly entertain, ravish, and intrigue is so monumentally big that its shortcomings are not enough to weigh it down from greatness. We willingly suspend our disbelief that sharp, intelligent enemy spies would attack our good man Roger Thornhill, unarmed and impeccably dressed, with crop-duster and gun, when it would seem that a gun alone would more than suffice—or that the CIA would go to such lengths to create a decoy to divert attention from a real agent, in an effort that would likely require the work of multiple on-site employees, many of whom would themselves risk being mistaken for Kaplan. We willingly suspend these disbeliefs because the story that Hitchcock and writer Ernest Lehman are telling us is so adventurous, smart, fun, and funny that we risk extreme enjoyment by not going all in.",Null,0,0,12 November 2012
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private Ryan
","A war film unparalleled in almost every respect, Saving Private Ryan is framed by a present-day story about an elderly man visiting a military cemetery with his family. He reaches a nondescript gravestone and falls to his knees, uncontrollably weeping. Within this frame of reference is another set of bookends: two unforgettable battle sequences. Like its epic World War II film predecessors—The Longest Day and A Bridge Too Far—Saving Private Ryan features a long list of key and supporting actors, including: Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Matt Damon, Ted Danson, Paul Giamatti, Dennis Farina, and Bryan Cranston. Also like its predecessors, the featured actors, who may or may not have served, do justice to the material and pay tribute, with earnest portrayals, to the men who helped make their comfortable American lifestyles possible. The first battle, at Omaha Beech during the landings at Normandy, is staggeringly realistic in its brutal recreation of June 6, 1944. The omnipresence of Spielberg's documentary-style camera assures us that the relentless intensity of that violent confrontation does not escape our attention, even if no single viewpoint could have witnessed the totality of the carnage. Back in the States, a woman in a government office, typing sympathy letters to mothers of soldiers killed in action, notices what appears to be a discrepancy, but reveals itself as the premise of the plot: a soldier named James Ryan has lost all three of his brothers in battle. The order to find Ryan and secure his safe return home falls to Captain John Miller (Hanks) who, along with those members of his squad who have survived the landing, embark on a rescue mission, the value of which they question every step of the way. Writer Robert Rodat makes a valiant attempt to weave character development, philosophy, and humor into the action-oriented middle. Much of it succeeds; some of it rings false. The more effective moments of character revelation are in those scenes that are divorced momentarily from the action, like the one that takes place in the ruins of the church, or the one on the steps. Easily the most heart-wrenching (and gut-wrenching) scene finds Medic Irwin Wade (Ribisi) downed by gunfire, surrounded by the group trying to tend to his wounds through his guidance. He asks them for clinical descriptions of what they are seeing and feeling, and then becomes anguished when he deduces that he has been hit in the liver. They beg him to tell them how to fix him. Resigned to his fate, he just asks for more morphine. When we finally meet up with Private Ryan (Damon), he refuses to abandon 'the only brothers he has left.' There is some talk about conflicting orders and impossible decisions, but it seems obvious what has to happen: Miller and his men will assist Ryan's squad in securing the bridge before sending Ryan home. The development of Ryan's character is, to say the least, disappointing. I have two brothers of my own, and I find it hard to believe that a man, even after two years of displacement, would not be able to picture the faces of any of his brothers, and the only story that he chooses to relate about his brothers (and the only one we witness) is frivolous, emotionless, and unfunny. I also find Upham's cowardly hesitation a bit difficult to comprehend, as genuinely moving is his moment of redemption. In the end, what we learn about these men is that they are ordinary. The emotions we feel at their passing are not for distinctly drawn, sympathetic characters that we have come to know and love—without whom we can't bear to endure; these overtaking emotions stem from our projections onto those real men who lost real lives in defense of our own. Therein lies the successful failure of Saving Private Ryan: whether intentional or not, the non-commanding presence of its fictional characters, paralleled by John Williams' brilliantly simplistic three-note theme, leaves room for the audience to ponder and appreciate the quiet, commonplace heroism of those average people who fought the actual war. When Captain Miller tells Private Ryan to 'earn this,' in a sense, he is asking us to live our lives in a way that will earn the price paid by those bands of brothers who sacrificed it all.",Null,1,2,12 November 2012
Schindler's List," Schindler's List
","Steven Spielberg's meticulous, passionate direction; John Williams' haunting, uplifting score, highlighted by violin solos by Itzhak Perlman; Janusz Kaminski's stunning black-and-white photography; Steven Zaillian's award-winning screenplay; and the acting brilliance of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes coalesce to render, ironically, one of the most beautiful films ever made, based on actual events that took place during one of the ugliest chapters in modern history. Neeson's screen presence as Oskar Schindler, the unlikely savior of hundreds of Polish Jews during the Holocaust, is commanding and magnetic. Kingsley's performance as Schindler's accountant and eventual friend is neurotic and tender. Fiennes plays Amon Goeth, a cold, sadistic Nazi officer, with startling range and subtlety. Williams' score and Spielberg's camera are characters in their own right, narrating and observing with unnerving honesty and pathos. From the perspective of the captive Jews and their plight, Schindler's List is frightening beyond imagination, thrilling, and unbearably sad. From Schindler's perspective, the initial prospect of profiting from a slave-wage workforce and an economic climate that only war could engender is opportunistically exciting. But when the plan changes from profit to protection, the excitement takes on a different form, as Schindler faces the danger of the Nazis discovering his altruistic motives at every turn. From the perspective of the Nazis, the unconstrained license to kill, at justifiably remorseless will, is liberating. Murder is easy, especially when the victims have been dehumanized in a much more savage way than any real wartime enemy. In one scene, a Nazi is firing rounds into a burning hill of murdered Jews, and he is screaming jubilantly and laughing. In another, Amon Goeth picks off random workers from his bird's eye 'villa' as if he is shooting at clay pigeons. It's target practice; it's a free game, a joke. That feeling of irresponsible liberation is eventually supplanted by true liberation as the clandestinely moral acts of Oskar Schindler overtake the immorality of the Nazis and as Schindler assumes the weighty responsibility for more and more human lives. Schindler's List is not a movie about the Holocaust, any more than it is a movie about World War II. It is about a man—a magnanimous profiteer—living in a time and place of unspeakable acts. It's about a forbidden friendship that flourishes amidst the failure of humanity and the prevalence of hatred. And it's about the hope for—not the triumph of—Good over Evil.",Null,28,47,12 November 2012
The Elephant Man," The Elephant Man
","The Elephant Man succeeds because of, and in spite of, David Lynch's indulgent direction. It's obvious from his body of work that Lynch is very interested in depicting the imagery of the subconscious mind. Whether the Elephant Man's dream sequences deepen our experience of the narrative and/or thematic content of the film—or distract us from it—is debatable. What is certain is that Lynch's artistic decisions and unconventional treatment of the subject matter elevate the film beyond mere melodrama. Anthony Hopkins' performance is noteworthy for its odd combination of quirky sentiment, reflection, and deep, raw, empathetic emotion. John Hurt's physical and mental characterization of the title character is otherworldly (one might say, 'Heaven-sent'), and it is very real, and very moving. The Elephant Man is full of surprises that spring from our continual rediscovery of its main character and from his discovery of the infinitely varying reactions of humanity to him. He starts as a side show and rises to become a main attraction. The film, based on the true events of a real man, is dripping with pathos. Although some 'emotional' moments border on being overdone, most ring true and evoke strong sympathy for a tortured soul whose heart and mind are as good and fine as his body is disfigured. Though he is the character in the film who least resembles a human being physically, John Merrick is undoubtedly the most human—even more so than the heroic, though motivationally confused, Doctor Frederick Treves, who appears uncomfortable facing emotional situations or expressing emotions of his own. John Merrick is rather obviously a Christ figure; his 'it is finished' line towards the end is no accident. Like Christ, the Elephant Man represents the oppressed—those who are misunderstood and mistreated because, on the surface, they appear threatening. From within the film's actual historical context (the 19th century), the misunderstood would have included the mentally ill, as well as the physically deformed: 'freaks' of every kind. And even though The Elephant Man reminds us how far we've come at understanding the misunderstood, it also points to how deep our xenophobia can run, and how far we have to go.",Null,1,3,12 November 2012
Amadeus," Amadeus
","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, as depicted in Peter Shaffer's abundantly successful Amadeus, has father issues. Although he enabled his son's musical career by parading his freakish talents across Europe like a circus sideshow (and profiting from his displays of precocious virtuosity), Leopold Mozart won't indulge Amadeus a bit of irreverent fun, and disapproves of his financial recklessness and his wife's inability to keep a clean house. Mozart rebels after his father's death by summoning his militaristic ghost through a very serious-sounding opera. Antonio Salieri, who rejoiced at the death of his non-musical, biological father, rebels on a much grander scale against his spiritual father for having created Salieri with a burning desire to create music, but lacking the talent to excel, while imbuing Mozart, a vulgar creature, with musical genius. Salieri's revenge materializes in an extremely indirect scheme in which he anonymously commissions a financially strapped, physically ailing Mozart to compose a requiem mass for his dead father. Tom Hulce, whose superbly entertaining portrayal of Mozart emphasizes the wackiness of his character, cannot, in a convincing way, deliver Mozart's proclamation that the requiem project is killing him. Salieri's suicidal guilt, however, over a murder plot that we cannot recognize as such, is convincing, because if Mozart were not dying from Salieri's disguised insistence on, and overt assistance in, the composition of the requiem, then, in Salieri's mind, there would be no revenge. What Salieri lacks in musical acumen, and will lack in posthumous recognition, he more than compensates with psychological intensity. All of the instances of mockery and one-upmanship directed toward Salieri, though beautifully amusing to us, don't amass to the superiority of Salieri's emotional depth over Mozart's. From beginning to end, Amadeus is more about Salieri (even a highly fabricated version of him) than it is about Mozart. Mozart's primary dilemma in the film—his desire to create popular music loved by all, while still satisfying his artistic inclination toward the avant garde, as well as the predominantly conservative sensibilities of his primary employers—culminates in an ideological confrontation between Mozart and the court of Emperor Joseph II, who has discovered, through a stretch of espionage perpetrated by none other than Salieri, that Mozart has composed an opera based on The Marriage of Figaro, a comic play banned by the Emperor. At first, Mozart tries to appeal to the emperor's love of music by relating the excitingly innovative musical attributes of the piece. Quickly, the argument turns to the source material, which the members of Joseph's court agree is 'vulgar.' This sets Mozart off into a tirade against 'elevated' art. 'Why must we go on forever writing only about gods and legends?' he asks the court. 'Because they do,' explains Baron Van Swieten, 'they go on forever. Or at least what they represent. The eternal in us.' Emperor Joseph quietly considers both sides. Jeffrey Jones' pivotal performance here as the emperor is his best, and one of the best in the film: hilarious and finely crafted. Mozart's dilemma, while reflecting the main theme of the movie, remains academic. Salieri's dilemma, on the other hand—between his unbridled appreciation for Mozart's musical supremacy—a supremacy which Salieri feels that he alone recognizes in its time—and his overwhelming jealousy over his own inescapable inferiority—dramatically courses through every frame of the film like lifeblood through the veins of a madman. Lest we conclude that the multiply revisited dilemma of Salieri is composed of too few notes, an assessment of F. Murray Abraham's intricately brilliant, Oscar-winning triumph proves quite the contrary. Abraham tackles every return to Salieri's venomous quarrel with his imprisoning lot with fresh, specific, passionate, artistic choices—on par with Mozart's legendary choices in the musical realm. Playing both the reflective, embittered, aged incarnation of Salieri, who narrates from within a physical asylum, and the younger Salieri, trapped within the asylum of his mind and situation, Abraham's performance serves the dual purpose of conveying the mad vengeance of Salieri's mediocrity and fleshing out the mad genius of his rival and idol—through infinitely expressive, stirring reactions to Mozart's accomplishments and to Salieri's unraveling defeat. Salieri's dilemma culminates in a climactic scene in which Salieri takes dictation from a dying Mozart, struggling to capture his uncontainable creativity, visibly and vocally admiring his ability, while gently helping him to his early grave. Outstanding performances by Abraham, Hulce, Jones, and the rest of the cast are accompanied by the Oscar-winning direction of Milos Forman and definitive renditions by The Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, conducted by Neville Marriner, whose musical recordings Forman weaves into the narrative like an expert artisan crafting a masterful tapestry.",Null,0,1,11 November 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: A Space Odyssey
","Kubrick and Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey is the greatest science fiction film of all time, not because it is based entirely on sound scientific premises, or because it works completely as a movie within the science fiction realm, but because it includes elements from nearly all scientific areas of inquiry—from archaeology to astronomy, artificial intelligence to exobiology—and because—more importantly—like science itself, it strives to explain that which has come to pass and to predict that which is yet to come, in a story that spans the far reaches of space and time, told from a cosmological perspective that characterizes the scientific pursuit of ultimate truths about man's existence and man's place in the universe. The film proceeds in four parts, the third of which, titled 'Jupiter Mission,' takes up nearly half of the film's total running time and operates as a mini-movie within the larger work. This third part most resembles a traditional movie in form and feel, and, accordingly, it is the most humorous and dramatic segment. My endorsement of 2001 is based sufficiently on this entertaining third segment, which sets astronauts Dave Bowman and Frank Poole on a course for Jupiter, guided by one of the most memorable nonhuman characters in movie history: the on-board mission-control computer, HAL. The purpose of the mission is not known to the human crew of the spaceship, which includes a number of members in hibernation. The human characters in 2001 speak in a perfunctory tone, while HAL's voice, although meant to be artificial, draws our empathy. Bowman's patronizing dismissal of HAL after HAL erroneously detects a fault in a communication device is the closest a human character comes to sounding human. The implication is that, among other human faculties like motion and calculation, man has delegated his humanity to his machines, which include physical machines, as well as the machinery of bureaucracy—a recurring theme in Kubrick's work. When HAL gets 'confused' after discovering Bowman and Poole's plans to disconnect him, another recurring theme of Kubrick surfaces: a mistrust of the machines and institutions man has invented to compensate for human nature. 'It can only be attributable to human error,' the puzzled HAL 9000 responds when asked about his discrepancy with the twin 9000. For how can man blame something manmade when things go awry? Unless we are to believe that HAL has been programmed to prioritize the needs of the mission over the lives of the crew—and to view his role as indispensable to the mission's success—then HAL's decision to terminate the crew is a sign of insanity (yet another recurring topic of interest found in Kubrick's work). Whatever the cause or nature of HAL's behavior, he is a product of human creativity, and human creations are imperfect. The message of this third segment is one against complacency, driven home by the sharp contrast with the showboating technological calisthenics done during the 'Moon Mission' of the second segment. The surrounding first and last segments deliver the film's larger, more problematic messages, as they feature the strange effects of the only 'characters' common to all four segments: the alien monoliths. Contact with a monolith, when accompanied by Richard Strauss's Thus Spoke Zarathustra can apparently induce evolution. These evolutionary developments happen in the first and last segments; it is later revealed that the high-pitch tone emitted by the monolith found on the moon is indicative of its communications with the monolith in Jupiter space. But what type of evolution takes place in the first segment, titled 'Dawn of Man'? If it's biological, then it happens in the wrong way, at the wrong time. This ape-man we are presented with, who learns to use an animal bone to acquire food and to defend territory—if he is a new, improved species, would be a product of an advantageous genetic mutation that would have happened to his mother. If the evolution is cultural, then every major insight, invention, or industrious feat commonly credited to human beings and/or their ancestors—from tool usage to the construction of the pyramids, from the generation of fire to the splitting of the atom—would have required the presence of, and would owe credit to, an alien monolith. The second evolutionary encounter—and the 'corrections' it achieves—symbolizes an even more fatalistic view of humankind, despite the disconcertingly triumphant musical theme that accompanies it. For this one is meant to be a biological evolution; the 'star child' is a new species, descendant from man, that doesn't need man's inventions to exist in space. The implication here is that man in space is like a fish out of water. But why go as far as space to find an environment in which human beings, in their natural form, lack necessary equipment? Even on Earth, we require fire to soften our food, clothing and shelter to protect us from the elements, schools to fill our heads with useful thoughts that wouldn't be there otherwise, courts to settle disputes, and machines to do work that we're not built for. Every invention, whether social, physical, or otherwise, compensates for a deficiency. And yet, the ability to create, through intellect and opposable thumbs, an environment in which human beings thrive, rather than adapting to an environment, is what sets us apart from other animals. The film celebrates this unique ability at the same time that it downplays it; the match cut between the end of the 'Dawn of Man' and the beginning of the 'Moon Mission'—in which the ape-man's rudimentary instrument becomes a space vehicle with roughly the same shape—implies that the only progress we are making is acquiring an ability to toss more and more sophisticated tools into the air, when all we really have to do is wait to be converted into—to be replaced by—a better species. Not a comforting thought. But then again, who says that good science fiction—or good science for that matter—needs to be comforting?",Null,0,2,12 November 2012
This Is Spinal Tap," This Is Spinal Tap
","In This Is Spinal Tap, Rob Reiner, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer not only created one of the funniest films of all time, but they also assembled a fictional rock band with a believable back story spanning several decades and a collection of rock songs covering the full spectrum of heavy metal topics (sex, religion, mythology, self-aggrandizement) and styles (glam rock, arena rock, folk rock, hard rock) with such fidelity to the musical genre of the period, that if you ignored the tongue-in-cheek lyrics, you wouldn't know they were parodies. This Is Spinal Tap is spoof as well as satire; it mocks the 'rockumentary' film which almost always takes its subject way more seriously than its import warrants, and it pokes loving fun at rock music, the rockers who spend their creative talents making it, and the fans who love it. The non-stop humor originates equally from scripted scenes and apparently ad-libbed bits, from situation and characterization, from dialogue and sight gags, and from back-stage shenanigans and musical performances. But perhaps the largest part of the ensuing hilarity stems from the various tactics that the aging band employs to overcome its main obstacle (its waning popularity). The fall from the top is long and demeaning, especially for a band as great as Spinal Tap. And while some men find Greatness, and others have Greatness thrust upon them, these guys grab Greatness by the armadillo in its trousers, and bash its head against an 18-inch replica of Stonehenge.

Groundhog Day," Groundhog Day
","'Well, it's Groundhog Dayagain' Harold Ramis' existential romantic comedy/fantasy begs the question, 'What could/would/should you do if you had an eternity to do it?' Bill Murray's character tries just about everything, only to find fulfillment in making every moment count. He plays Phil Connors, a weatherman who finds himself caught in a time warp, where he relives the same day over and over again. In a sense, Groundhog Day is the opposite of those movies premised on a character who has lost his/her long term memory (e.g., Memento, 50 First Dates). In those movies, the main character is unable to remember anything that happens from day to day, while everyone and everything else persists as usual. In Groundhog Day, Phil's memory—more specifically, his mental memory—and only his memory—persists from day to day, while the memories of everyone else and the 'memory' of the physical world—including that portion of it that Phil's body occupies—are reset every morning at precisely 6:00 A.M. So, he is able to pig out on donuts without gaining weight, commit crimes without serving long-term sentences, and commit suicide without losing his life. No matter what he does or what happens to him during each day, he wakes up in the same physical condition in the same bed in the same bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania, where he is stranded by a blizzard and expected to report on the findings of Punxsutawney Phil, the famous groundhog who predicts the weather with his shadow. At the outset, Phil Connors is a shadow of the man he could be: successful and intelligent, but cynical, self-centered, inconsiderate, and nearly anti-social. He is ahead of himself, using the people and events of the moment as stepping stones to a better potential future that he views as being more worthy of himself. His repetitive predicament forces him to be alive in the moment, because the future is out of his reach. At first, he is simply unnerved by his situation, but as time goes on (or continues not to) he discovers the advantages he can gain by acquiring knowledge, while the people in his world leave each Groundhog Day behind. He robs a bank truck by being able to predict the precise moment when a guard loses focus. He learns the details and preferences of the women in his world so that he can successfully woo them. He starts out as the guy every guy wants to be: egotistical, insensitive, and able to breeze by on blind ambition. His gradual omniscience enables him to trick his producer, Rita (Andie MacDowell) into falling for him, but to make it stick, he will eventually have to use his unlimited time to become the man every woman wants—the man he knows Rita deserves. Danny Rubin's script does a brilliant job of exploring the strange specificity of a human moment. So, although Phil can use his knowledge of the day to reliably change certain events for the better (like breaking a boy's fall from a tree or saving a man from choking), other events (like the death of the homeless man) are unalterably overpowered by fate, and others (like that first moment when Rita genuinely falls for him) can't be recreated, despite hundreds, perhaps thousands of attempts. Murray's acting performance is remarkable both for the entertainment value it confers and the difficult challenges it handily overcomes. Not only does he have to act a version of a scene as if it had never happened before, but then he has to act another version of that same scene as if he is acting (to Rita) as if he hadn't been there before, with a subtle wink to us that reminds us that he had. Andie MacDowell's acting challenge is slightly different, but just as formidable, and her performance is just as remarkable. She has to act each version of a scene as if she had never been there before, but with slight variations depending on how genuine Phil's advances come off and how much he has told her (and how much she believes) about his situation. Harold Ramis can probably be credited for allowing the material enough wiggle room to examine various facets of time and existence, without ever letting it foray into irreversible darkness. Groundhog Day is light, clever, touching, and funny throughout. In fact, it's so good, you'll want to relive it again and again and again and again",Null,3,6,11 November 2012
Rocky," Rocky
","Rocky opens on the title character engaged in a boxing match in what appears to be a makeshift ring in a dark, smoke-filled, modestly populated, abandoned church. Rocky wins the bout and bums a half-smoked cigarette on his way to his locker. In spite of his victory, a woman in the crowd puts him down, calling him a bum. Nevertheless, he'll take home 'winner's share' that night for his effort: a little over forty dollars. Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is down on his luck and down for the count, which, in boxing lingo, means that he's running out of time. He's not the only one. His friend Paulie (Burt Young), who still lives with his sister Adrian (Talia Shire), bemoans that they're all gonna die alone. Rocky's a nobody surrounded by 'losers' on their way to nowhere. And then he wins the lottery. The world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), suddenly out a ranked contender to fight in an upcoming bicentennial event in Philadelphia, decides to pick a local boxer at random to fill in. He gives the title shot to Rocky (of course) because he likes his nickname: 'The Italian Stallion.' Rocky's take for fighting the champ will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Like other lottery winners, Rocky's friends step out of the woodwork to capitalize on his fortune. Paulie comes up with an advertising angle using Rocky's name. Rocky's loan-shark boss, Gazzo, gives him five hundred bucks for 'training expenses' and says not to worry about it, but we know he expects some return on his investment. And Mickey (Burgess Meredith), who recently gave away Rocky's locker at his local gym, comes knocking on his door to offer him his management services. The only one immune to the bandwagon effect is Adrian. Stallone, who also wrote Rocky, smartly positions the scene in which Rocky and Adrian fall for each other before Creed's promoter, Jergens, makes Rocky his offer. Rocky is an extremely well-written movie, especially in the dialogue and character arenas. Each of the principal characters is given distinctive, nuanced characteristics, believable motivations, and strong development, filled out by four Oscar-nominated performances. Naturally rhythmic dialogue is punctuated by bursts of relationship-defining moments: Mickey spouting his disappointment in Rocky's choice to become a 'leg-breaker' instead of a respectable fighter, Rocky temporarily fending off Mickey's last-ditch effort to soak up some of Rocky's glory, Adrian's defense against Paulie's unsubstantiated rant. Rocky is also an extremely well-scored movie. If the outstanding writing, acting, directing, and editing hasn't already done the job, Bill Conti's original music will virtually guarantee that the viewer feels everything that this film is about. 'Philadelphia Morning'—which accompanies the first training scene, the one in which Rocky can't make it all the way up the steps—embodies tender regret for a life possibly wasted and an opportunity possibly granted too late in the game. Counterpoint that with the longing, uplifting, victorious song 'Gonna Fly Now'—which is played when he does make his way up the steps, salvaging, for the moment, a bit of hope. The war music underscoring the final fight ('Going the Distance') is indescribably moving, especially in the middle, where it breaks down into a sad, lonely, struggling violin, as Rocky tries desperately to stand up, while Mickey, like a father protecting his son, pleads with him to 'stay down.' The framing of this fight, inspired by an actual bout in which Chuck Wepner lasted fifteen rounds with Muhammad Ali, dramatically demonstrates the award-winning directing talent of John G. Alvidsen and the award-winning editing talents of Richard Halsey and Scott Conrad. Like any effective drama, this final showdown fully exposes the heart of the film. It's obvious that Apollo Creed possesses superior athletic ability over Rocky. It's possible that Creed is just not in the best shape of his career, and that Rocky's left-handedness is throwing him off balance. But none of this really matters. When the fight announcer wonders aloud what could be keeping Rocky up, the probable answer has nothing to do with boxing ability. What is keeping him up is an iron will forged by a lifetime of being stepped over, knocked around, and kicked aside: the kind of life that can turn any man into a force to be reckoned with. After the fight is over, Rocky tries to field questions from the ring announcer, but he quickly realizes he's never been in this situation before. Like a scared child who has wandered too far from home, he calls for his mother, and she rescues him. Rocky loses the decision, but he's beaten the clock; he's still standing during the final bell, he's proved himself a winner to his hometown, he's redeemed his self-respect, and he's won Adrian's heart. Fitting rewards for the ultimate underdog in movie history.",Null,0,0,12 November 2012
The Untouchables," The Untouchables
","The music under the opening titles of The Untouchables, from Ennio Morricone's Oscar-nominated score, sets the tone of what is to come; the quick-tempo beat suggests hard-hitting action, and the stealthy horns promise something sinister. The movement over and around the title itself indicates other qualities of the approaching feature: shadowy, stylish, and artful. These movements, however, do not foretell the entire story. Triumphant fanfare will later signal legendary deeds, and somber winds will mourn fallen heroes. We open with a view from the ceiling (a favorite perspective of director Brian De Palma) of an opulent parlor where Alphonse Capone (Robert De Niro) takes a shave. De Niro looks larger than usual, having ostensibly gained the weight appropriate for the role, and his portrayal of Capone is appropriately larger than life. Screenwriter David Mamet's signature brand of stylized, naturalistic dialogue becomes immediately recognizable as Al fields questions from pandering members of the press, who hang onto every one of his words and laugh at every one of his jokes. Despite Capone's claim to the contrary, violence comes quick, as the next scene follows a little girl into a shop where a salesman unsuccessfully attempts to peddle beer to the owner. The owner and the little girl both pay for the owner's refusal to buy with their lives. In a later scene, the mother of that little girl thanks Eliot Ness (played by Kevin Costner, in one of his first and finest feature performances) for taking on the dangerous task of bringing the murderous gangster to justice. To do that, Ness needs to recruit some help, and he starts, quite accidentally, with a beat cop named Jim Malone. This is Sean Connery at his best. His portrayal of Malone rightfully earned him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and this performance is worth more than all of his earlier turns as James Bond put together. Sporting an Irish brogue, Malone bestows wit and wisdom onto his fellow Untouchables, which come to include sharpshooting Italian-American George Stone/Giuseppe Petri (Andy Garcia) and FBI accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith). This terrific team of four covers a nice range of maturity and street smarts. Stone, aside from protecting the property and citizenry of the city of Chicago, also shields the film from ethnicism, and his recruiting scene is one of the funniest in the movie. Wallace also provides some comic relief, as he moves from pencil-pushing bean counter to heat-packing avenger. More importantly, he provides Ness with the idea of bringing Capone in on income tax evasion. Ness finds strange irony in the idea of trying a murderer for not paying his taxes, but is trying him for running liquor any less insidious, especially when it is apparent that Ness is merely following the letter of Prohibition law by enforcing the Falstead Act? Malone fuels the whole operation by blackmailing information on Capone's movements out of an old acquaintance from the police force, George (Brad Sullivan), who is obviously playing both sides for profit. Why this fact escapes Malone is not clear. In a movie so packed with violent, bloody conflict, it is notable that the father-son relationship that develops between Malone and Ness provides the film its heartbeat. When Malone falls, Ness's pursuit acquires an aspect of revenge, and although the real Eliot Ness never took down Capone's top enforcer (Nitti actually committed suicide), fictional Eliot Ness's discovery and chase of Malone's killer, played to slimy perfection by Billy Drago, constitutes one of the greatest scenes in a movie characterized by one great scene after another. When he finally catches up with Nitti, Ness has an opportunity to take him out, but decides instead to do the legal thing and arrest him. 'I'm gonna come see you burn, you son of a bitch,' he tells Nitti as he cuffs him, 'because you killed my friend.' Nitti decides not to let well enough alone: 'Your friend died screaming like a stuck Irish pig. Now you think about that when I beat the rap.' Morricone's violins screech as we see in Ness's face the snapping of the strings that had been keeping his mental instrument together, and he sends Nitti over the edge of the rooftop, screaming all the way down, Ness taunting him from above, 'Did he sound anything like that?' Mamet and De Palma don't stop there. Back inside the courtroom, Stone asks Ness where Nitti is. Ness responds, 'He's in the car.' We creep up behind the car through which Nitti's body met with its bloody demise, as Morricone's violently insistent strings continue. A tad much, perhaps, but isn't the essence of overindulgence to linger too long on something that's too good to let alone?",Null,0,0,12 November 2012
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a Wonderful Life
","Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life is like a photo negative (or positive) of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. The Ebenezer Scrooge character in Capra's film, Mr. Potter (played perfectly by Lionel Barrymore), rather than occupying the position of the main character, is the antagonist. The protagonist in the film is the Bob Cratchit character from Dickens' story, a man named George Bailey (played perfectly by Jimmy Stewart). The supernatural (or imaginary) visions and visitations in A Christmas Carol comprise the bulk of the story, whereas the same in It's a Wonderful Life take up less than fifteen percent of the movie's screen time, although it seems like much more. In A Christmas Carol, we have an extremely unlikable central character, who is shown what the world would be like if he doesn't change; in It's a Wonderful Life, we have an immensely likable central character, who is shown what the world would be like if he had never existed. This second part of the film—in which George's guardian angel Clarence (a delightful Henry Travers) shows George how 'each man's life touches so many other lives'—is a fun-house-mirror look back at the first part—a fantasy that resembles a rough night of drinking: fun and frivolous at first—then serious, painful, and dire in the end. The first part of the film, which inhabits more than eighty percent of its screen time, tells George's life story: his abundant acts of altruism, which enable the continual thwarting of his repeatedly voiced ambitions; his continuation of his father's fiscal and ideological battle with Potter, in the name of the Bailey Building and Loan, an institution that represents the 'community' side of the film's diatribe against the form of unbridled, unrelenting, anti-humanistic 'capitalism' represented by Potter's monopolistic business interests; and George's union with Mary, his lifelong sweetheart, and their settling down in that quaint, provincially idyllic American town named Bedford Falls, which George had seemed so insistently focused on shedding like a cheap suit. The sad, decadent, cold, flashy, Vegas-like imagining of Bedford Falls sans George Bailey convinces him (and us) that his heart is much bigger than his ambition, and it belongs to the members of his hometown. The final sequence jerks buckets of tears, not through manipulation, but through the genuine redemption of a man whose life of selfless acts repays him in a way that only a town like Bedford Falls can.",Null,2,4,12 November 2012
When Harry Met Sally...," When Harry Met Sally...
","The quintessential romantic comedy, When Harry Met Sally lives up to the twofold promise of its genre; it is as genuinely funny as it is romantic. Credit its writer, Nora Ephron, its director, Rob Reiner, and its four leads—Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, and Bruno Kirby—for the film's steady stream of well-earned laughs. The movie properly centers around well-read, well-bred, well-dressed, well-mannered urbanites who have good looks, good jobs, and good futures. The question of suitability need not consider intelligence, physical attractiveness, or the ability to provide. That leaves compatibility of character to determine who ends up with whom. This keeps the romantic conflict light, which opens a void for the comedy—and possibly some truths about relationships—to fill. Filling that void is where most romantic comedies fall short—leaving them shallow and hollow, and not very funny—and where When Harry Met Sally succeeds. Billy Crystal plays Harry Burns, who 'meets' Sally Albright, played by Meg Ryan, multiple times throughout the film. Each time they meet, time has changed them, so it's as if they are meeting each other for the first time. The true first time they meet, Harry is a self-inflicted cynic who always flips to the last page of a book before he reads it so that he'll know how it ends in case he dies before finishing it. His eyes seem perpetually half-closed, and his tone reflects a young man who thinks he knows it all. He plants the seed that germinates into the main thematic question of the film by positing to Sally that men and women can never be friends because 'the sex part always gets in the way.' Sally is a wide-eyed, prim-and-proper optimist, who admits that she has a positive outlook on life, as if she knows there's something wrong with that. Each time they meet again, their eyes change disposition in opposite directions—his becoming more open as life throws him curveballs, and hers becoming less perky as experience wears down her naivety. Eventually, their eyes meet in the middle, and the third meeting, which takes place roughly ten years after the first, turns Harry and Sally into friends. About a year goes by, and we find the title characters dancing together at a New Year's Eve party. This scene clinches our suspicion that Crystal and Ryan aren't just fine comic performers; they're fine actors. They act this scene with their eyes. Throughout the film, both actors prove their ability to adapt to their characters' changing ages and attitudes. Ryan's performance is chameleonic, her character subtly adjusting to each costume change. This scene also demonstrates the film's exceptional use of music; as Harry and Sally realize what is developing between them, we realize that the song they are dancing to is Harry Connick Jr.'s rendition of 'I Could Write A Book,' which finds the appropriate lyrics, 'how to make two lovers of friends.' Still, the couple does not consummate. Time passes. They try to set each other up with their best friends through a double blind date—another scene in which Crystal and Ryan tell the story with their eyes. And we recognize Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher as the perfect players of the 'other couple.' Finally, Harry and Sally have sex, and we learn the real reason why men and women can never remain 'just friends.' It's not because the man will always want to have sex with the woman; it's because, once they have sex, the woman will attach more meaning to the act than the man. This answer raises another question: when does, or why should, sex mean something, and when does, or why should, it mean everything? The film doesn't really answer this question, but at least it asks it. Instead, it ends in textbook romantic fashion, with Sally standing alone at midnight on another New Year's Eve, and Harry running through the streets to meet her once again, this time forever, as Frank Sinatra serenades them with 'It Had To Be You,' instrumental variations of which have accompanied moments throughout the movie. We may be tempted to view the final scene as the only unoriginal one, but I like to appreciate it as a dual realization—part Harry's, and part ours—that he, and the movie he lives in, really do, after all, believe in true love.",Null,0,1,12 November 2012
Jaws," Jaws
","Jaws is two movies rolled into one. The first half takes place on and around Amity Island, which is inhabited by a small summer tourist community in the Atlantic, where Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) seems to serve as the entire police department. When a girl's freshly severed arm washes up onto the beach, Brody, who correctly surmises the cause to be a shark attack, attempts to close the beach, only to meet strong opposition from Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who sides with the local business owners who depend on summer dollars for their very lives. The mayor explains away the girl's death as a boating accident and orders the beach to remain open. Several attacks later, Brody finally convinces Vaughn to allow him to hire a local shark hunter, Sam Quint (Robert Shaw) to kill the shark. Chief Brody and a shark expert from the oceanographic institute, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), accompany Quint on his mission, and their hunting expedition on board the Orca constitutes the second half of the film. Across both halves, Jaws manages to cover all of the three main types of story conflict. Brody and Hooper's struggle with Mayor Vaughn and his constituents in the first half exemplifies the conflict of Man versus Man. In the second half, Man battles Nature as the crew of the Orca pursues the Great White. Both Brody and Quint fight with themselves; Brody must battle his fear of the water, and Quint, a Captain-Ahab-like figure, must deal with his tragic flaw of selfish pride in refusing help from technology or outsiders in killing the shark. The shark hunt in the second half of Jaws is an escape, as well as deliverance. The ensuing adventure on the open sea contrasts nicely with the horror/slasher/suspense piece that comes before it. It's also like a mini-vacation for Brody, who, in the first half, is inundated with annoying requests from various islanders. The three-man pursuit of the shark, though scary, provides the singular excitement of a focused objective that releases Brody from all of the scattered, petty demands of his island job. It's a joy to watch these three very different men come together towards a common goal and mutual appreciation. Spielberg and company tell Peter Benchley's story with plenty of humor, and though his score is known for the shark theme, which has become synonymous with impending danger, John Williams provides an interlude that makes Jaws a feast for the ears. The finale of the film is explosive and satisfying as it features the triumph of a common man who always gets his shark.",Null,1,3,12 November 2012
Bull Durham," Bull Durham
","Tim Robbins plays Ebby Calvin 'Nuke' LaLoosh, the newest promising young minor league pitcher for the Durham Bulls. Nuke has been blessed with a 'million dollar' major league arm, but he can't control his talent with his 'five cent head.' Enter Crash Davis, the smart, seasoned catcher, hired by the Bulls to take Nuke under his wing and turn him into a winner. This is Kevin Costner's best performance, and Crash is his best-fitting role. Also enter Annie Savoy, expertly played by Susan Sarandon, the Durham Bulls' unofficial tutor. Baseball is her religion, but sex is her favorite pastime. Each season, she picks a different Bull to train and seduce, and this year, it's between Nuke and Crash. Since Crash refuses her crass offer, Nuke is her man. But Crash has made an impression that lasts and builds for the rest of the movie, and we know from the outset, as do Crash and Annie, that if they were to get together, it would turn into something real. Nuke is the pivot point of this love triangle, as well as the target of both Annie's and Crash's didactic objectives. As Crash and Annie take turns giving lessons to Nuke, their appreciation for each other's experience, wisdom, and baseball knowledge grows (as does the sexual tension between them), until Annie lets her personal needs interfere with Nuke's training, as she mistakenly believes Crash has done the same. Genuinely funnier than Major League, more authentic than The Natural, and more coherent than Field of Dreams, Bull Durham is the truest baseball movie, perhaps because it takes place in the minor leagues, where thousands of hopefuls struggle and play for peanuts, for a chance at a dream, and for the love of the game. Like the game itself, the career of a baseball player includes a lot of waiting. Most never get the call. Many who do, like Crash, who spent 21 days in 'the show' (the majors), don't last. And fewer still become stars. And, as Crash explains to Nuke, it's a game of inches, a matter of a few dying quails that makes the difference between playing in Yankee Stadium and selling Kenmore appliances at Sears. Nuke gets called up, because he has talent (and a couple of fine trainers), and Crash, who has brains, loses his position on the Bulls' roster. Bull Durham celebrates the exciting possibilities of Spring, as it laments the knowing stillness of Winter. Ron Shelton, who wrote and directed Bull Durham, conveys well the isolation of baseball players at game time, as they talk to themselves on the mound and at the plate, as well as the isolation of lonely women trying to find fulfillment through sex, marriage, philosophy, and America's pastime. The climax of the movie is a climax (or several), as two lonely souls come together in a shared realization that although they are beyond their primes, they can still choose to dance the night away.",Null,0,1,11 November 2012
Rear Window," Rear Window
","They say that acting is reacting. If that's the case, then Jimmy Stewart's performance in Rear Window is one of the greatest ever recorded on film. During most of the movie, we are watching him watching the people across the courtyard enclosed by the apartment complex in which he has been cooped up. We literally witness the events of the film through his eyes. Those eyes eventually witness what he believes to have been a murder, but he has a tough time convincing his three confidants: his girlfriend, Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly), his caregiver, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his longtime friend, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey). John Michael Hayes' screenplay is a lesson in misdirection. Not only are we distracted from the central mystery by the lives of the inhabitants of the apartments surrounding the one occupied by the alleged murderer, we become concerned with the challenged relationship between Jeffries (Stewart) and Lisa. Little by little, the focus shifts more and more toward the investigation of Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), Jeffries gains more evidence against his suspect, his confidants buy into his theories, and the comforting separator between Jeffries' apartment and that 'private world' across the courtyard breaks down, until a moment when Thorwald looks up and peers across the divide, directly into Jeffries' camera-turned-spyglass, evincing genuine chills. Hitchcock couldn't be more in his element, directing a voyeuristic murder mystery about a temporarily disabled photographer, replete with blonde bombshells, macabre innuendo, and sweat-inducing suspense. Rear Window has no shortage of humor, intrigue, and romance, but its signature thrill is one to which all avid moviegoers can relate: the thrill of watching other people, who don't know they are being watched.",Null,0,1,12 November 2012
Gladiator," Gladiator
","I was entertained! Ridley Scott's Gladiator is stunningly beautiful—visually, aurally, and semantically: a complete artistic achievement. The recreation of Ancient Rome is something to behold. The musical score by Hans Zimmer, featuring gorgeous vocals by Lisa Gerrard, is rousing and touching. Convincing, interesting, and moving acting performances abound, with standouts by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, and Djimon Hounsou. The story is pure, distilled, derivative blockbuster/epic. The originality of Gladiator is found in its focused reduction of common movie ore into golden nuggets: essential, concentrated elements that have been grandly designed and then boiled down to make viewers alternately cry, laugh, and cheer—in a big way. Although we are spattered with occasional 'political' discussions about Republic versus Empire, there is no social commentary here about the Roman system breeding corruption, and who needs it? The emperor wants an empire; the senate prefers a republic. Evil is personified in Commodus (Phoenix), the scheming, cowardly, childish, jealous, lecherous, murderous son of Marcus Aurelius (Harris), who tries to tiptoe over his only son (as if he wouldn't notice or care), by choosing as his successor 'Rome's greatest general' Maximus (Crowe) to become the 'protector of Rome' and to 'end the corruption.' 'Commodus is not a moral man,' Marcus Aurelius reminds Maximus, giving his reason why his son should not rule. Good is personified in Maximus, the strong, loyal, moral, brave, good-natured, hands-on, fighting family man, who swears to uphold Marcus Aurelius's wish to give Rome back to its people. But, alas, Commodus doesn't take the news from his father too well, and he kills Marcus Aurelius and takes over anyway. Then he orders Maximus, his wife, and his son to be killed. But Maximus escapes! But he can't get to his family in time to prevent their demise. And so, the perfectly justifiable tale of revenge has been perfectly set into motion. Commodus doesn't know that Maximus has survived his plot, and his own egotistical plan to make the people of Rome 'love him' (since his father obviously didn't)—instead of serving the people (by tending to plagues and so forth)—becomes the vehicle by which Maximus will eventually take his revenge, and Commodus will meet his own undoing. The second act 'delivers the goods' as Maximus is enslaved and then converted into a gladiator. In perfect movie irony, his skills garnered from leading real battles in defense of Rome against its enemies enable Maximus to make a name for himself ('The Spaniard') in the entertainment arena; and Commodus's schedule of gladiatorial games, meant to distract the people of Rome from their real problems and attract them to his 'loving' rule, pulls the now famous gladiator Maximus, incognito, to the Coliseum. The gladiatorial action sequences don't disappoint. What may slightly disappoint, for some, is the highly unlikely showdown, in which the emperor, who has already successfully detected and foiled the plot to overthrow him, offers Maximus a one-on-one battle with him in the Coliseum. The possible disappointment comes not just from the improbability of the offer (after all, the fact that both Commodus and Maximus are alive at this point is improbable enough), or from the showdown itself, or its outcome, but from the machinations through which we arrive at the showdown. After all of the battles that Maximus has had to survive to arrive on Commodus's doorstep, it would have been purer had Maximus fought his way to the final confrontation, rather than having been granted a 'shot at the title.' What if Maximus had successfully reunited with his men, so that we actually witness the return of their loyalties to him, as well as a battle with those still loyal to Commodus, in an effort to restore Rome's greatness? Still, we do get a championship bout between Good personified and Evil personified, and Maximus—whose belief in an afterlife (spiritual and/or historical), which the film highly commends ('What we do in life, echoes in eternity')—deservedly rejoins his family at their incorporeal home.",Null,0,0,11 November 2012
The Godfather," The Godfather
","Francis Ford Coppola's mafia masterpiece is a three-hour family portrait—a brilliantly and beautifully rendered oil painting in motion. As impressive as his direction of scene and mise-en-scene is Coppola's direction of the actors. The director's authenticity filter was apparently tuned to a heightened level of sensitivity; not a moment of film goes by that makes you question its reality. The acting performances are at their most engaging during the quiet moments—the calms before and after the storms: Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen holding back tears, trying to remain interested in the demands of Sollozzo after he tells him of his adoptive father's demise; Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, as he musters up the courage and opportunity to take out Sollozzo and McCluskey; Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, losing all hopes of the life he had wished for his favored son when he learns of his acts of murder. The Godfather is so well-acted, so well-directed, and, from the perspective of character detail and human interest, so well-written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, that we ignore (or forgive) the fact that the dramatic structure is disproportionate—that well over a third of the film has come and gone before the true hero decides to accept his journey, and that shortly after he does so, he is forced into temporary exile—onto a vacation of sorts—into a 'B' plot that stars the now central character. This foray seems misplaced—even disruptive—from a dramatic standpoint, but it enriches the experience from a historical-interest perspective, and the contrast between the modest quality of life of the Old World and the opulence of the New World adds justification to the emigrated family's strong dedication to business success. This mild sagging in the second act points up the merits of the film as an experience. Indeed, there are multiple stretches where the film nearly lets the air out of the balloon to pursue character or relationship development as various constituents align themselves with or against the family. By fending off the tension escalation of a traditional thriller, The Godfather assumes the feel of real life, so that the ultimate showdown—the final dismissal of the 'bad' guys, though dramatic in and of itself—set against the rising organ notes of the baptism of Michael's nephew—is somehow anti-climactic. The real climax happens at the very end, when Michael officially becomes what he swore at the beginning he was not, and would never become. Exactly what that is the film cleverly obscures: the head of an extended household, the president of a company, the king of an empire, or, least suggested, the leader of a gang of common criminals. This is the 'organized' side of organized crime. These guys raise families, conduct business, and wage wars; the crimes they commit only appear as such to the larger community within which they move and influence. Until the final murder montage, and with the exception of Jack Woltz's unfortunate prize-winning race horse, the violence initiated by the Corleone family seems like justifiable revenge or preemptive self-defense; no one who gets it is innocent. And the brother we are led to identify with is presented as a war hero, a reluctant protector of his family, and the happy medium between two ineffective extremes: the quick-drawing, hot-headed Santino, and the calculating, ascetic lawyer, Tom Hagen. Through Michael, The Godfather assumes a coming-of-age flavor that is as thrilling in its adventurous exoticism, as it is frightening in its familiarity. Whether or not its analogies hold, the film offers, for the price of a view and a few hours of leisure time, the opportunity to become a patriarch, a CEO, an emperor, and a boss—all from the comfort and safety of your spectator's seat. Now that's an offer you can't refuse.",Null,0,1,12 November 2012
