Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not as good as the first, still keeps it fresh
","Now this is an interesting continuation. It really barely has a lot of what the original has. There is action but it is so much different. For one, this movie takes influence from many different other genres. The first pretty clearly took influence from samurai and kung-fu movies. And this one very clearly takes influence from westerns. It doesn't feel out of place though, especially with Budd in this movie. This movie is also more dramatic. And comedic. It's a weird tonal shift from the original movie but it still works. Somehow. The tone doesn't work quite as well balancing the drama and the comedic as say Pulp Fiction or Inglourious or Django or even the first Kill Bill. But just knowing this is a Tarantino movie makes it work. And it doesn't get rid of all Asian influences. Lest we forget the funny and pretty great Pai Mei sequences? Now this movie also takes itself a lot slower. It starts with a great little talking to the audience with a tension filled score under it. And then it slows down with showing us the wedding rehearsal where this whole bloody story begins. Then, she goes after Budd, fails and is buried alive. Then we go back even further so we know how she got all the kung-fu she knows. Then it is fairly linear. I can see how this would feel jumbled, but Tarantino takes real care of these sequences with fantastic editing and shots.Although done with more western flair, the movie has plenty of style. Just done differently. For one, the battle with Elle is a lot more comedic in tone but shot fantastically. And she doesn't really die, just gets a more poetic justice sort of end. And Elle kills Budd with a black mamba. But style just oozes from the Pai Mei stuff. Plenty of kung-fu creativity.It's really hard to explain why this movie works because it almost seems like a mess the way I'm describing it. I think one is more of a presence of Bill and Elle because they are both very good characters. I'd say the other thing is that even if it is more of a continuation rather than a sequel, it differentiates itself enough to feel fresh. Especially near the end it is more dramatic with the Bride's daughter being alive. And of course the western edge is also very different as well as the only person the Bride actually kills in this movie being Bill. But the end of the movie is also where some problems arrive. I thought the writing was great for Bill typically. Especially his thing about superheroes. But truth serum? Really? That has to be the dumbest thing in a Tarantino movie yet. And the actual fight that we have been waiting about 4 hours for lasts maybe 30 seconds. Although very well choreographed and suitably emotional, it is way too short. But on an overall scale, its a great sequel. It has all the visual flair, style, and fantastic musical choices of the first and keeps it fresh as well.

Django Unchained," Bloody fun
","After plenty of western influence in his movies, Tarantino finally makes one. But in his own weird fusion of genres making this like a western-action-drama-comedy hybrid. This movie is filled with so much good its hard to name. All of the performances are fantastic. Even the lesser roles are fun such as Don Johnson or the bag heads, who have maybe the funniest scene in the movie. Its really hard to say who steals the show. I would say Christoph Waltz, but he already played this sort of character in Inglourious. Leo is usually pretty good, but he's great here as the brilliant villain Calvin Candie. Sam Jackson was also fantastic as his character. Foxx is pretty great too especially as his character grows to be more confident throughout the movie.As usual for Tarantino it is drenched in fantastic dialogue, style and blood. The musical choices are once again great. And the whole movie is amazingly memorable. Every little scene is easily memorable. Tarantino just has that quality I suppose. It's hard to really nitpick anything. Maybe it's too long but it uses every second to its advantage. Another amazing Tarantino movie. 10/10",10,0,2,10 June 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino's best besides Pulp Fiction
","This is the movie he made after Jackie Brown. I thought I might just point that out. A big budget, larger scale action blockbuster. This is the one that would change the direction of Tarantino's films. And honestly, it might be my favorite besides Pulp Fiction.This movie oozes with style and beautifully choreographed action. This movie has an anime section akin to Japanese anime. That's some cool stuff. Even the non-action parts are some really good stuff. Like the guy from the old Street Fighter movies as Hatori Hanzo and making the Bride's sword. And the fantastic soundtrack. The great opening scene where the Bride gets shot and then the somber 'Bang Bang' by Nancy Sinatra plays.But of course, the amazingly choreographed action makes this movie. A lot of it is showcased in the Crazy 88 fight and the few fights before it. It has some brilliant uses of the style. Of course, there's black and white which was actually used to avoid an NC-17, but works very effectively. And the beautifully shot battle between the Bride and O-Ren. No music really adds a lot to it. It's quiet and oh so effective compared to the loud blood fest of the Crazy 88.But there's also the opening hand to hand fight scene with Vernita Green which is also very well edited. Very surprising scene as it is interrupted by Green's daughter coming home and then they talk. And it starts back again as quickly as it began and then ends once again with a knife to Vernita's chest. What a brilliant tension filled scene.The movie also never takes itself too seriously. That's for the sequel. But the fun action and style leads the whole way. Also along with Buck, and other fun scenes. Lest we forget other great scenes like the whistle scene as Elle Driver comes to kill the Bride in her sleep. Or interrogating Sophie. 'These will be things you will miss.' I love it.Honestly, it might be the best action movie of the 2000s, at least for me. And Tarantino has a lot of my favorite movies. Maybe I enjoy his movies a bit too much. But even with that, it's one of the my favorites. Kill Bill Vol 1 gets a 10/10",10,0,3,10 June 2017
