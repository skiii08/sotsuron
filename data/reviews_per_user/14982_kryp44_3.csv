The Ring," A real 'Scary Movie'
","The copycatism in Hollywood really aggravates me. I don't know who ripped off who, but the premise of this movie is almost identical to the recently released Feardot.com. The difference is that 'The Ring' uses a videotape as the vehicle of retribution for the unhappy ghost whereas 'Feardot.com uses a website. They similarities even extend to the same bloody noses that the unfortunate victims receive after having viewed each.However, I found 'The Ring' scarier, more intense, and thought provoking than 'Feardot.com'. The ending of 'The Ring' actually gave me some chills even though I thought that the reason given for what finally happens to the main characters pretty lame.",Null,0,0,22 October 2002
Insomnia," Nice drama, not a thriller...
","If you are going to see this movie expecting another nice little suspense yarn like Memento, you may be disappointed. However, you will enjoy Al Pacino's tour de force performance as an embattled LA cop, and Robin Williams does a nice turn playing against type as a creepy Humbert Humbert victimizing an Alaskan Lolita. There is very little suspense but Pacino should certainly garner some early Best Actor nominations.",7,0,0,31 May 2002
JFK," Preposterous!
","Simply put, this is one of the worst films ever made. Maybe not in the technical sense because Oliver Stone does know how make a film; however, he's just so wrapped up in his government conspiracy psychosis, that you would be better off spending your time with a film that doesn't pretend not to be a fantasy fairy tale. I love a good conspiracy flick when it has a shred of imagination and intelligence. But Stone has so many people involved the JFK assassination that the only person I'm sure wasn't involved in this massive conspiracy/coverup was me. How could so many people be involved in JFK's murder, but absolutely no one ever came forward to cash in on the hysteria in some way or another? Like I said, preposterous. I watched this movie hoping to see something that I hadn't thought of before. Instead I got a story in which Stone apparently went to a 3rd grade class and told them to make up as many wild hypotheses as they could about the 36th president's death. The only saving grace was Walter Matthau and John Candy who are always terrific when presented with dramatic roles. I think that this movie has ruined Stone's and Kevin Costner's careers. Neither one has made a successful movie since.",1,24,68,17 June 2002
