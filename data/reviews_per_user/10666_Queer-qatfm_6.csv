The Legend of Bagger Vance," Very middle of the road.
","Without giving too much away, 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' isn't really so much about the caddy played by comedian Will Smith.  The film, which is a Robert Redford flick -- meaning go see it knowing he's going to tell you the whole story from start to finish -- is more about a boy who watches a golfer played by Matt Damon who's caddy is Bagger Vance, who's played by comedian Will Smith.Have I mentioned that Will Smith is a comedian?Ah, okay.  Well, that's precisely my point, faithful readers.  While I completely enjoyed Smith's laid back and confident approach to a character I've read was made for Morgan Freeman, I know for a fact that the part was altered, and in my opinion, made less effective because Will Smith was signed.Oppositely, I don't like Matt Damon.  I never have admired his 'I'm-a-movie-star' kind of glitz he brings to every role.  And while nothing's changed here, when he takes his role in this otherwise hokey fantasy about golf, I can't help but want to latch onto his character as if he was the only real element in the film.  After all, Savannah, in all of it's old-classic wonder, seems so real and yet provides a quaint unreal setting for the piece.  Viewers needed Damon to be there for them, and he comes through quite nicely.So all that is really left to come together for 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' is it's moving story about a golfer who's 'lost his swing' who's feeling a little 'in the bunker' and can't quite make 'par for the course' on life. (And every other metaphor Bagger Vance uses in his trance inducing monologues.)  If there wasn't so much love stuff, I'd say the film would have coasted into a solid B, but alas the movie decides it doesn't want to play it solo (like the game of golf) and introduces way too often Damon's love interest played by Charliez Theorn ('Men of Honor') who seems too rigid anyway to allow herself to be her character.I liked 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' but would have only watched it if I caught it on a lazy Saturday afternoon and had nothing else to do. Kind of like when I'd probably watch golf.Legend of Bagger Vance Grade C",5,0,1,3 November 2000
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," I'm breaking up with it because I think I can do better.
","I've been looking forward to Crazy, Stupid, Love for a couple of months now. While the TV Spots haven't been very good, the extended trailers seemed to promise a real visceral and gut busting romantic comedy that was full of heart and laughs. I've been yearning for a nice drama I could rally behind in the midst of the Summer Movie ExperienceÂ™ but unfortunately that's not quite what I got here.Steve Carell plays Cal, the sort of hub which all the other players revolve around. There's Julianne Moore who's divorcing him, Ryan Gosling who mentors him, Kevin Bacon who replaces him, Jonah Bobo who's his son and looks up to him (but is obviously not important enough to be included on the poster in spite of being about 1/3 of the movie's focus) and then there is Emma Stone who plays a role along side Ryan's character and more, but that'll be kept secret for spoiler concerns.It's a stacked cast, to be sure. It's too bad that most of them aren't very funny. Carell tries his improvisational routine which often really only means he keeps repeating the same phrase over and over using different weird voices. It's clearly one of the only comedy tools he knows and was best used during the superior film 40 Year Old Virgin. The fact he's pared with Ryan Gosling makes little since, but what's even more shocking is just how much funnier Gosling ends up being in comparison. Even Emma Stone seems to miss her funny mark in this near disaster which eventually pulls out madcap hijinks when the whole time it's been more of a mental comedy. And then when it comes to the sincere moments none of the actors except for Julianne More really pull it off. I guess they all just wanted to do what they're known for and not really that well.The whole thing is overloaded. There is bloated and disjointed plot everywhere. Too many characters who have too much that needs to be done so they can wrap it all up in a neat bow a number of times in the overextended denouncement. Kevin Bacon is a good example of this. There is no real good reason he's in this picture. His character could have been just referenced and left off camera since he adds nothing to the show. Simiarily, Marisa Tomei's crazed school teacher role seems like it belongs in another movie entirely. She provides such a jarring clash of misfit comedy that doesn't work here. And after those parts are cut, a general overall snippy snip snip would have helped tighten things up as well.So really what we have here is a romantic comedy that is not nearly as romantic or funny enough. It's too long. It's too populated. And doesn't seem to know just how crazy or stupid or lovely it wants to be. To be honest, other than some nice scenes here and there (Ryan giving Steve a manly make over was in the trailer) the only real satisfying storyline is that of Hal's son and his crush on his babysitter. But even that gets a kind of disturbing conclusion.",Null,0,1,23 August 2011
Cars 2," Something went wrong at Pixar
","It's a challenge to critique movies for which you are squarely not within the intended audience. It's part of the reason why I skipped Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer. While I'm sure we would have done well to get in touch with our inner Heather Graham, we just didn't think it fair to toss a pair of bad grades at a movie aimed at little girls. We'd much prefer tugging on their pig-tails and saying they have cooties. That being said, Pixar has always presented itself as not only the superior animated movie product to beat, it typically produces films that are creatively accessible on multiple levels. In fact within Wall-E and Up there are segments of pretty high end pieces of cinema. So for that reason, we're reviewing Cars 2.Except it appears that this time something went wrong.Perhaps the creators were on a Hawaiian vacation much like Ken and Barbie enjoy during the throw-away Toy Story short that appears before the feature presentation. Yes, I know, I know. We should be so lucky to even get cartoons before our movies. But I remember when these things were completely original shorts that were almost as buzz worthy as the reason why we were in the theatre to begin with. Disappointment sets in early, though Woody and Buzz do try their best to remain relevant past the completion of their trilogy last summer.When it comes to Cars 2, we're treated to what is essentially a James Bond film featuring Larry the Cable Guy's character Mater. Quickly I'm reminded of Arthur and how Russell Brand was in nearly every single scene. Except instead of a man-child out of control Brit, we instead get an even more grating redneck caricature that's more hijinks than ha-has. Mater has been misconstrued as a spy, and there's a whole caper involving alternative fuels. Yes, Pixar is all about the green technology, so you gotta have a bit of environmentalism with your fun as usual.The only problem is there isn't much fun to be had. At least not for an adult. The kids will likely enjoy some of the antics, as Mater screws up things but by doing so manages to solve problems along the way. Lightning McQueen is hardly featured. And everyone should really pay attention to just how marvelously beautiful the scenery is in the three international cities the World Grand Prix takes place in. (An effort included to no doubt boost international box office.) But really the spy story is just kind of lame. Not to mention rather violent for a rated G movie. I mean, cars with guns, rocket launchers, and tasers? So, in conclusion, you probably can skip this movie unless you have little ones. Yes, the visuals are stunning and enhanced to some degree with 3D technology. And there is just a sliver of heart to be found in the midst of all the madcap espionage. But generally speaking, it's all about the annoyance of Mater and marketing so that following the film's conclusion you can buy lots of stuff featuring the Cars brand. After all, when I bought my ticket I was given a small pamphlet that let me know Target has 'everything Cars'.",4,3,8,23 August 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Adjustment Bureau is based on a Phillip K. Dick short story, I knew I would be in very good company.
","It's excused if you didn't see The Adjustment Bureau in theaters. After all, adult hard sci-fi thrillers aren't exactly everyone's cup of tea. Ones that feature plenty of men in fedoras though, thankfully, are right up my alley. And seeing as this particular Adjustment Bureau is based on a Phillip K. Dick short story, I knew I would be in very good company.See, what those guys wearing great head gear do is they open up their little nifty CG booklets and when someone does something they're not supposed to, they use all manners of tricks to get them back on course. Like a traffic tie up to cause you miss an important meeting you would have been made to look foolish for, only so that later during a reschedule you end up nailing a promotion. Or maybe during a chase, you'll slip and fall and lose sight of the one you are making eyes for on the train only to never see them again. It's a destiny vs free choice type situation, and I'm pretty well tugged in by Matt Damon's charismatic character.He does end up having one of those moments when this girl is exactly what he feels he must have in this world. And, of course, those pesky people in fedoras keep trying to remind him, subtlety and then more aggressively otherwise, that not only will he not continue on his path of political fame if he peruses her, she'll miss out on her opportunities as well. So the question becomes not necessarily destiny vs free choice, but what's more important, goals and ambition or love sweet love.Things get a little ripe and over the top the further down the rabbit hole Mr. Damon travels. We're given more and more world building and rules as we go along. Sometimes it feels they're just making stuff up to satisfy a plot, and I suppose that's mostly what such fantasy flicks are required to do. But it seems to much at times and I'm still not quite sure how much I'm falling for the romance angle that progressively gets harder to root for.Still, one shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. Or a gift movie that's actually very entertaining throughout and provides more than its fair share of nail-biting suspenseful moments in the midst of good old fashioned adult storytelling. Characters are great, it's filmed well, and I'm so wanting to buy myself a fedora now.",Null,1,2,22 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A long awaited and actually rather welcome end.
","When we last left The Boy Who Lived, I was all in a bitchy uproar that they decided to split the final film. Warner Brothers claimed it was because there just was so much good stuff, it'd be improper for them to do otherwise. I said that was b.s. and it was all about the money. Now having seen the completed portion of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, I can further confirm that I was the one who was right, not that it really matters now.What I can't believe is that even in the second half of the film, it seemed like they simply didn't not know how to pace themselves correctly. Maybe they feel other things were just more important, I dunno. I could spend all the rest of this night and probably a full week trying to tell you how I would have done it differently. But to do so would give too many spoilers than I'm comfortable with. However, as one example, I would have excised so much of the mindless forest hiding out in Part One and put the sequence from Gringots from Part Two in its place. That would have given that first movie a bit more excitement -and- gave them more time to focus on the hurried events towards the end of this concluding piece of cinematic history.Most reviewers are taking this opportunity to gush about how amazing everything's turned out with this series. They love how the whole lot of films got produced with the same cast, spanning many years with different directors, and now that all the cards have been shown, we simply have one long 8 film epic fantasy film that should be given the highest accolades and honors. But, I protest that movie critiquing doesn't work that way. No matter that this is the conclusion of a two-part film that shouldn't have been separated in the first place still stands in my book.Yes, the battle over Hogwarts involving so many of our beloved characters is pretty darn close to perfect. With so much kinetic energy sown into this one moment, it really had to deliver and it so very much did. I felt peril. I felt a strong lurching in my chest that I was being pulled along at a rapid clip. Perhaps it was because we'd been dilly dallying around for so long. Or maybe, like Harry, I was ready for the end to come. And yet, even in the midst of moving from one grandstanding moment to the next, director David Yates continues to fail me. Many heartfelt and powerful moments become more like blink-and-you'll-miss-them after thoughts in narrative. Major things are happening to people not named Harry Potter that fans of this series care desperately for, and we've been brought all this way, often spending far too much time repeating the same mantras: isolation, sense of purpose, fate/destiny. And yet we can't give these other moments just a bit longer to spend in the forefront? No. We have to rehash it all. And I mean everything from the very beginning as Harry spends some time in a scene very reminiscent of Neo visiting with The Architect in the much maligned Matrix Reloaded. Fortunately however, this incredibly lame scene where all is revealed to the most inept audience member is counterbalanced with a lengthy sequence giving the entire history from Severus Snape's point of view. While technically a flashback, it also ends up being one of the best parts of not only this Harry Potter film, but maybe of the last three. Also of note, it seems that Daniel Radcliffe's acting ability has started to far surpass everyone around him. While most are just chewing scenery, he seems, for what may be the first time, really coming across AS Harry Potter who has experienced all of these things.I guess what I'm saying is that Harry Potter's ending is much like a giant ship bobbing up and down on the ocean filled with many dangers, and I don't think that David Yates was the right tugboat for the job. He might of gotten us into harbor and home, but we've seriously wrecked most of the rigging, the franchise, and other boats in the process. Essentially, it's a satisfying end as the story is finally given its theatrical so long, but I think a better job could have been done and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 does little to improve on that. We haven't gone into outstanding territory again, more like, just marginally better than it was when we were back at Order of the Phoenix and it was his first try at the series.",Null,0,0,6 September 2011
Fast Five," Still drifting away from car porn, still provides a nice heist.
","I fully admit that I have a love affair with this series of misadventures that focus heavily on the beauty of fast cars. While it's only the original The Fast and The Furious that is the lone solid entry in the franchise, that doesn't lessen much how giddy I got enjoying just how silly things got in the ridiculously titled 2 Fast 2 Furious. Then, a detour to Japan for the third film Tokyo Drift. Most don't think very much of that one, where Dom only is featured for a moment and the kind of racing is more than a little queer.It really wasn't until Fast and Furious, the sadly subtitle or numberless flick from 2009 I found myself not as pleased with what was being done with these various collection of meat heads and grease monkeys. Slowly the movies were focusing less on the culture of street racing and more toward generic chase action films.Sadly that degeneration has come to a full head here in Fast Five. Call it Oceans Eleven with a hotter, if less talented, cast of actors. Yes, the gang is all here. Even Han who was introduced and killed in Tokyo Drift which apparently hasn't happened yet in the timeline of the films. Yeah, bitchesÂ… technically 4 and 5 are prequels to 3 and yet sequels to 1 and 2. And if that isn't redonkulous enough, we now have intertwined The Rock into these things. He steals the show here, with the action heating up in Rio where there are not only plenty of angry birds, but plenty of cops and robbers heisting to be done by Dom and his crew that also includes Luda, Tyrese, a nameless woman, and a pair of unique locals that I'm fairly certain are life partners.Replacing the street racing culture â€” quite literally, since just when the film's scattershot script decides to go there, the scene is cut â€” there is a boring idea of ganking a drug lord's bank vault. The fact it's hidden by the corrupt police is just a great excuse to have all the confusion action as white-knuckle a thrill ride as possible.Most of the acting is worse than ever, but there are several set pieces that work really bigger and better than ever. And as much as I'd totally would love to slag on just how bad a Fast Five should be, it's just a lot of hyperactive FUN! FUN! FUN! So basically even though I'm not fond of the choice to change the core of what these films are about, they still bring a lot of what I want: Over the top stunts with easy-going characters that say dumb things like: 'Give me the veggies.' and 'You know what this is? I'll tell you what this is.' Along with overheated testosterone fights.",Null,0,1,28 August 2011
