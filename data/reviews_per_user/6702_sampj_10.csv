Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 'This is my country of Kazhakhstan,is nice.'As was the movie-film.
","LOL.I just couldn't stop laughing at this hilarious comedy masterpiece starring Sacha Baron Cohen as hysterical and insane Kazhak,Borat Sadigyev.Despite all the racism and nudity,Borat was so hilarious,it could keep you laughing for days on end.Borat says very funny catch phrases such as 'in a my country,they would go crazy over these two,this one,not so much'.In the film,Borat travels around America to find his beloved 'Parmela'(Pamela Anderson) and marry her.But along the way he and his companion Azamat get into truck loads of trouble.Like when Borat turns a whole rodeo against him by singing,'Kasakhstan is greatest country in the world,all other countries are run by little girls',that was just wrong.the downside of the movie was there was too much racism.It was horrible how Kazhaks treated the Jews.They would've nearly got sued for that.All in all though,a very funny movie which has just created a famous new movie character.9/10.P.S. Americans shouldn't watch this if they can't take jokes about their country.",9,9,15,7 September 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Best of the 3,no questions asked!!!
","Pirates 3 was heaps better than i expected.After i had seen Spidey 3 and it wasn't that great,that gave me a bad feeling about Pirates 3.But i was wrong.Pirates 3 is an absolute hit.Johnny Depp was again terrific as was Geoffrey Rush,i'm glad they brought Barbossa back into it.I was expecting Davy Jones to die but not Will Turner,although that mite be a good thing because he's a boring actor and I hope he's not in the 4th one if they make it.The main reason i liked this movie is because there were a lot of surprises,like Tia Dalma turning out to be Calypso,and Davy Jones' long lost love.What i really liked though is that they had Keith Richards in it as Jack's dad.This was good because they are so much alike.This movie also had an appropriate ending unlike the 2nd one.I reckon 3 hours was a suitable length for the movie because it made good sense.Overall,Pirates 3 was a fantastic movie and at the moment my favourite movie of 2007 so far.9/10",9,1,1,26 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Good but could've been better.
","Spidey 3 was good enough to earn my satisfaction,but what the hell were they thinking making Tobey MacGuire(Peter Parker) act like a drunken idiot on screen.Tear level was too high.I hated the bit where Parker beat the total crap out of Harry Osbourn.Kirsten Dunst wasn't that great but i did like James Franco and Tobey Macguire when he wasn't possessed.I also liked Parker's dancing in the bar and the bit where Parker says 'Good Riddance' when he thinks he's defeated the Sandman.Special effects were pretty good,but as i said Parker's act of stupidity in the middle of the movie wrecked it for me and quite possibly other people.I didn't agree to the fact that Venom(Topher Grace) was only there for a short time.I would've liked to see him come into it half way through.Overall I liked it and in my opinion it's worth paying $8.50 to go and see it.7 out of 10.",7,1,2,12 May 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Tim Burton and Johnny Depp at their very best.
","Tim Burton has done an excellent job into adapting a stage musical into a movie.He was the right choice to direct the film in my opinion.As for Johnny Depp,I found him to be like Edward Scissorhands with a Jack Sparrow accent.His performance as Sweeney Todd was sensational,especially because he was able to combine his then 2 best ever movie roles into his own best ever.Helena Bonham Carter was excellent as Mrs Lovett but the only problem I had with her character was that she looked to much like Bellatrix Lestrange (who she also portrayed) from HP5.I also found Mrs Lovett's character quirky and I like quirkiness.Alan Rickman was marvelous as the malevolent Judge Turpin.Sacha Baron Cohen,although he wasn't in it very long,provided a humorous flourish to the movie as the fraud-master Pirelli.Don't know the actor's name but the guy who played Toby was a good addition (he could sing well for his age).Sweeney Todd overall is an excellent stage show that Tim Burton has successfully made into a fantastic movie.10/10",10,0,2,2 April 2008
Forrest Gump," A beautiful story.I can see why it won 6 Oscars.
","Forrest Gump is a heartwarming tale about a very different man who just wanted to fit in.Seeing his story throughout the movie made me think 'wow,this guy was some guy'.Forrest Gump was marvelously played by Tom Hanks who i'd only ever seen (well,heard his voice) in Toy Story.I thought it was funny that he was telling random people at the bus stop his life story.I'm glad that they didn't ignore him.Robert Zemecks directed this movie very well because it made perfect sense.I loved Forrest's confidence that he could do anything if he tried.It was such a lovely story,it made me cry,and i'm not that emotional when it comes to movies.The supporting cast was great as was the set design and the picture.Forrest Gump is fantastic and remember,life is like a box of chocolates because it's true,you don't ever know what you'll get.Thanks for that phrase Forrest.10/10",10,29,49,1 June 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Wasn't sad to see Alfonso Cuaron not do Number 4.
","The reason I am saying this is because i couldn't believe how crappy Harry Potter 3 was.The movie was too rushed.Here's 10 reasons why i hated Number 3.1.Barely any Quiditch,Gryfindoor won the Quiditch cup that year for goodness sake.2.Harry gets his Firebolt at the very end of the movie,he got it half way through in the book.3.The stupid music in the background of the scene where they were casting Riddikulus.I know it had a point but it was too corny.4.Sir Cadagon was deleted,they needed to show a replacement for the Fat Lady.5.The movie was too short,they could've added at least another 20 minutes to it.6.The Dementors looked to much like Nazgul from Lord of the Rings.7.Bad acting,the only exceptions were Michael Gambon,David Thewles and Gary Oldman.8.Bad directing,didn't like Cuaron's methods.9.The Hogwarts choir trying to sing a Macbeth poem was pointless.10.Wasn't exciting at all.There you have it,the Harry Potter franchise took a wrong turn.At least Number 4 was better.4 out of 10",5,0,1,12 May 2007
The Dark Knight," Great storyline+Great Director+Excellent acting=A terrific example of what a brilliant movie is.
","The main reasons that I wanted to go and see this movie were that I enjoyed Batman Begins and that I wanted to see for myself if Heath Ledger is as good as everyone was saying he is.Well I can safely say that i wasn't disappointed with the outcome of this movie.The Dark Knight is probably the best superhero movie that I have ever seen.It is also the only sequel that i've liked better then the original.Christopher Nolan has delivered everything in this movie.The special effects,the set design,the costumes,everything was superb.The acting provided the other half of this brilliant film.Gary Oldman,Aaron Eckhart,Maggie Gyllenhaal,Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were all outstanding in their respective roles.But by far,the main standouts in this movie were Christian Bale and Heath Ledger.Bale was again oustanding as the Bat.You can certainly see that he has improved from Batman Begins even though he was good in that to.Bale's performance as Batman makes Michael Keaton,Val Kilmer, and George Clooney's portrayals as Batman look like a joke.I could probably talk for a whole hour about Heath Ledger.His performance as the Joker had everyone laughing,gasping and looking on in horror at the same time.Ledger's last appearance has certainly stunned everyone.Being able to laugh like he did was a supreme effort.I can see why people are saying that he deserves an Oscar for this role.Besides Bale,he outshone everyone else.The Dark Knight is by far,the best movie of 2008 so far.It is definitely a mustsee for Batman and non-Batman fans alike.10/10",10,3,7,18 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Order of the Phoenix delivers!!!!!
","I had a bad feeling about OOTP because of its length.2 1/2 hours just seemed too short.But stuff that feeling,this was a darn good movie.There might have been a lot cut out from the book but it was brilliantly adapted into a movie.Acting was fantastic,the best it has ever been,especially that of Imelda Staunton as Umbridge which was the standout.Special effects were again satisfactory as was the set design.A new thing about the movie is it didn't feel like a kids movie anymore.It was much darker and more violent.I still can't get over the fact that Harry,Hermionie and so on looked a lot older than in previous films.This could be a bit of a spoiler but the fight scene at the end of the movie is terrific so readers,look forward to the end.Overall an absolutely terrific piece of work and surpasses Pirates of the Caribbean 3 as my favourite movie of 2007.",8,1,3,11 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," J.K Rowling would be impressed.
","I'd only just finished reading the book when the movie came out and i must say i was impressed.The storyline was well put together so it was made very true to the book.Special effects were exceptional,especially the Quiditch match.Also loved the inventive magic spells used in the story but i suppose JKR is the one to thank for that.Actingwise,Robbie Coltraine was good as Hagrid as was Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall.Didn't like Richard Harris though.I wish they put Michael Gambon as Dumbledore earlier.The giant chess game was clever as were the flying keys.No wonder this movie was popular because when i went to see it,we were lucky to get a seat because the line up went out the door and down the street.Great movie and a thumbs up for the whole family.7 out of 10",7,0,2,12 May 2007
The Untouchables," Brian De Palma,you are magnificent!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","The Untouchables i've gotta say is one of the most superb blockbusters that I have ever seen.De Palma has taken a true story and turned it into genuine piece of work.I congratulate him for that.Kevin Costner and Sean Connery were both brilliant as was Robert De Niro,nowone else could've done a better performance of Capone than De Niro.I really liked the way it was all set out.The good thing was it kept very true to the story.The Untouchables is jam packed full of action from shootouts to fist fights.There were some bits in it that were gross,like where Capone beat the absolute crap out of a gang member with a baseball bat,or when Malone(Sean Connery) was riddled with bullets in his home.My favourite part was when Ness(Kevin Costner) said 'he's in the car' when he had just killed Nitti by pushing him off the roof and into a car.Great 80s flick and always will be one of my favourites.9 out of 10",10,0,1,12 May 2007
