Requiem for a Dream," IF YOU ARE A HUMAN BEING YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE!
","Darren Arronofsky(director of Pi) has once again made a ground breaking movie. Its not just the inventive cinematography or the incredible acting by each member of the cast. It's not that it has a strong social statement. Its that this movie has a rhythm, that stays strong through the entire film. It has a natural order. It's beautiful. I've been thinking of other things to say, but there are too many. You just have to go see it!",10,0,0,17 November 2000
Fight Club," One of the coolest movies of the 90's!
","While many movies of Fight Club's domain still reaches for a Usual Suspects type ending. Fight Club goes for something interesting and new. A spectacle of a crazy man's plight as he tries to get rid of his evil side. Besides the great script this movie is pushed to genius status through the incredible work of the main actors Brad Pitt, Ed Norton and especially Helena Bonham Carter.",10,0,1,9 November 1999
The Fan," Eat your heart out Blair Witch!
","Robert De Niro shines in this stalking, psychotic thriller. Mixing his frightening characters from Taxi Driver and Cape Fear, we cringe at every moment he is on the screen, scared because we can never predict what he will do next. De Niro plays Gil Renard a father and a baseball fanatic excited about his teams chance to get into the playoffs with their new hot prospect, Bobby, played by Wesley Snipes. As Gil's life goes down hill (he loses his job and custody of his son.) he becomes more and more obssessed with Bobby and finds a way to become a part of Bobby's life. By the end of this movie your heart will be pounding so hard you might not be able to get up for a few hours. This truly was one of the scariest movies i have ever seen.",6,1,3,5 August 1999
