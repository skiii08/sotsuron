Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If this weren't a Star Wars, I wouldn't've watched it
","The one line summary is all i need.  Lack of plot, lack of good acting, all except the lightsaber sequences, natalie portman and ewan mcgregor; horrible kiddy characters (i.e. jar jar binks) with useless roles, only for minor comic relief to audiences under the age of 7.  The only character worthy of screen time (Darth Maul) ends up getting sliced in half.  And in 'The Empire Strikes Back' didn't Obi-Wan say he trained directly under Yoda?  Well apparently, mistaken was George Lucas.",3,0,1,26 February 2003
Sleepy Hollow," Classic Burton
","amazingly, though not a direct parallel with Washington Irving's sketch book sleepy hollow, the best sleepy hollow movie made.  it probably appeals to me because i like the darker more morbid movies better.  The set was amazing, casting was incredible...Tim Burton strikes again.  It's also good to see how Cristina Ricci has come from playing Wednesday Adams to Kartina Van Tassel in Sleepy Hollow.  Great character developement and backstory with Ichabod Crane.  All in all 9.5/10",Null,0,0,26 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Not bad, but not good either
","With the Two Towers, i thought all in all it was a good movie.  However, like most fans of the books, Peter Jackson strayed too far from the plot line of the book.  My main concern is, when (in any of the three books) did Arwen leave middle earth for the undying lands?!  If you can answer this, you know the answer is never.  So, with all respect to Mr. Jackson, get back to the real story!",9,0,0,4 January 2003
