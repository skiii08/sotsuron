10 Cloverfield Lane," I was very impressed by this movie!
","I watch a lot of movies. I enjoy most of them. Some of them impress me, and this is one of them.The pacing is good. I was never bored (and I'm willing to put up with some of that). The story is well thought out. I'm hardly ever surprised by a movie; this one is right up there with what M. Night Shyamalan does when he's at his best. I really enjoyed the acting. I'm a John Goodman fan, and keep an eye out for his performances. Mary Winstead is also very talented; I've been a fan since Scott Pilgrim. She turns in a very nice performance here. I wish I was more familiar with John Gallagher Jr. He also performed admirably. The combination of these excellently formed that 'suspension of disbelief' effect a movie is supposed to have when it's well done. That sense of 'yeah, this could happen in some iteration of our universe'. I highly recommend this movie. It mixes elements of survival (ala Defcon 5), drama involving tough-girl leading ladies (Enough), and movies with sweet plot twists (the Sixth Sense comes to mind). All in all, a fantastic debut effort for Dan Trachtenburg. Hollywood, put this man to work!",9,2,2,16 June 2016
