Black Swan," Swan Diva
","Natalie Portman's performance in 'Black Swan' reminded me a bit of Isabelle Huppert's magnificent job in Michael Haneke's 'The Piano Teacher.' The self-destructive parallel's between the two roles, coming from opposite directions (Black and White Swan?) are startling.What's also startling is the effect of both overall movies.I would never recommend the Haneke film. Why would you want to obsess over a woman who's sado-masochism ranges from breaking glass in a young girl's coat pocket to hysterical sex on a men's room floor.With Portman, why would you want to watch, even in horrific fascination, this obsessive creature with such a masochistic core. She literally hurts herself repeatedly and succumbs to the fingering of the ballet director in seconds after rejecting him at first.There's one scene where Portman is in a tub of water. She immerses herself. The Baptism reference is obvious. From underwater, she sees blood dripping into the tub, first from her rival whose face appears, then from a cut on her own hand.She has lived her frigid, ultra-disciplined live as a slave to her craft for so long, when faced with success and the demands of a manipulative director, she begins to go mad.I can think of only a couple of viewpoints from which one would appreciate this study. Either as someone who sadistically enjoys seeing her unravel or from the viewpoint of someone who identifies with her masochism.As I can't come up with either viewpoint, my only question is 'Why would anyone want to watch this all-encompassing pain?' Huppert won best actress at Cannes, Portman will win at the Academy, but that still doesn't answer the question.",5,4,13,17 December 2010
Inglourious Basterds," No Matter How You Spell It
","...'Inglorious' as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee, minus the second word. It is terrific cinema.I don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over-squeamish. Let them never know what they're missing.I did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of Tarantino's previous films. In every case, save 'Reservoir Dogs,' they have improved with additional watching.So although I gave it ten stars, I did so reluctantly. It leaves me no 'up' to go to.Yes Christoph Waltz is the Nazi we've all imagined the worst to be. He is cultured, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel, grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim.To understand Tarantino's films, you need only have a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. The colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary, brighter yet. In the French farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but excessively so. Outside a brilliant sun is shining, but in the one room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black.It is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by Waltz, as the 'Jew Hunter' of the SS, who dangles his host French farmer over the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times, then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding.A second sadistic German, well-played by August Diehl, later functions as important actor in the final plot twist. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz....almost.Film classes will study much from this movie. They should look lovingly at the superb pacing. Tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene, building suspense in the manner of Hitchcock, then at just the breaking point, suddenly coming to a resolution.For color, look for a final shot at a French Theater, where its secretly Jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of Nazi leadership.We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, awaiting the hated German dignataries who will arrive for a film preview of the latest Deutsch film masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious accomplishments.Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater, her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests. It is a single shot that would be worth an entire film.There are thankfully many more such images, many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense.In short, see it. I'm sure you'll see it again and again.",10,530,979,25 August 2009
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Channel Your Inner Dude
","If you buy into the concept of reality, find a nice soft couch and talk to someone who can listen.But if you can suspend belief for some real laughs, terrific pacing...and the return of the Dude (yes, that Lebowski guy!), take a ride into desert Iraq and enjoy this for what it is, a lot of fun.I can't remember when I laughed out loud so much in a long while. Whoops, did I blunder into a LOL? Sorry about that. I'll try to avoid a ROTF.Clooney, Bridges and Spacey are very good. And the Army, well, if you served before they ended the draft and the supply of unwilling recruits, then the Army is perfect. Surreal. Blundering. Often hilarious.'Be All You Can Be!'",8,3,6,13 November 2009
The Wrestler," Some aging observations
","I found this to be a most satisfying film. The other positive reviews are spot on. The direction is excellent, Rourke (Ram-Robin), Tomei (Cassidy-Pam) and Wood are terrific.So I'll try to add some observations you may not have encountered.Not just in its character definitions but in many other ways, this is a film about aging, about not being able to really go back.I saw it here in New Jersey where the outside locations for the film were shot. For me, the Garden State plays a supporting role just as the actresses, and does it so well.Ram and Cassidy meet on a Saturday morning at a second hand shop in Elizabeth. I could be wrong but I think I even know the block it's in and I haven't been to Elizabeth in years. Old clothes to be rediscovered, a metaphor for Ram's life and the relationship with his daughter.And a secondary theme of surface appearances--Ram as the wrestler, not as Robin, the ordinary guy who works at an Acme (also New Jersey) and hates his real name--meets face to face with Pam, the real Cassidy, who is no longer on stage, but a mother of a nine year old making ends meet by dancing. He's taken aback but still finds her to be beautiful and attractive.She suggests he track down his daughter. The daughter's home is a quiet, aging small colonial that might have been built in the late 40s or early 50s. No grand entrance, just a simple door. On a street of endless identical aging homes. If this wasn't actually filmed in Linden or Rahway, it could have been.After he gives his daughter a present for the first-time in years, she agrees to go with Ram to the shore. Down the shore, for New Jerseyans. The location, the aging, abandoned boardwalk of Asbury Park. It's winter when they visit but it will always be winter for Asbury Park. Gone are the rides and food stands and certainly the crowds of lost decades--a striking parallel to Ram's own career. All that remains are the shell of the former Paramount Theater at one end (not shown) and the Casino, the home to all the arcades at the other. It's padlocked, stripped bare and covered with graffiti. They go in and even bust down a door to dance a romantic father-daughter dance to imaginary music in a high-ceilinged room that once hosted skee-ball games and the like. I know. I played them, maybe you did once too.Yet, they not only can't bring it back, but the daughter can't even remember the casino from her youth. They sit on a window ledge, framed by the interior of the old building, looking out at the sea in a marvelous camera shot.In a strange universe, I watched the film with about two dozen others on Oscar Sunday afternoon. As Bruce Springsteen sang the theme while the credits rolled, everyone sat quietly, not moving from their seats. When the lights came up I was astonished. The entire audience was 50 or older, as I am, as Rourke is, as those areas of New Jersey are even more so and as wrestling seems to be as a national prime time entertainment.We all age. If you want a surprising insight into that process, I recommend 'The Wrestler'! (My only quibble is with Tomei's alleged 'aging dancer.' She does it well, very well indeed. But no one could believe the aging part of the description, she's just strikingly beautiful. Or maybe that's because I'm just an older observer.)",8,0,0,22 February 2009
Inception," A Question of Balance
","'Inception' is a terrific mix of think and thought.Christopher Nolan has made story paramount and beefed up as many action scenes as possible. Somewhat neglected in that mix is the role of character.If you loved 'The Matrix' than this is for you, in spades.By using dream within a dream story lines, we see the same people doing different things at the same time. It's not all that challenging to keep track of four or five levels at a time, especially if you accept the premise that time flows more rapidly the deeper you get.Five minutes in real time is an hour on level one and the bottom level can consume a lifetime.For me, the fabulous sets and the intricacies of the dream structure had me riveted to the action. But I did long for some character development, a nuance that wasn't related to that person's dream story.The choice of Ellen Page is particularly questionable. She doesn't seem to have the depth of expression of even an ordinary actor and as one of only two women featured, should be better.But there are some fabulous effects. Roped bodies moved as a weightless pile through corridors and elevators. A falling bus on the second level that takes forever to hit the water into which it eventually plunges.The planting of seeds isn't some new concept. The next time you thirst for a drink you've never tasted, think advertising and you've come up with your own seed.If you ask why such a good rating, with so many detractions, well, it's really an 8-and-a-half and it is damn good at what it does.",9,4,8,20 July 2010
The Social Network," Anti-social networking
","David Fincher does a marvelous job of telling a complicated tale, pulling us in and riveting our attention. he has a history of that.It is curious that so-called 'social' networking began in such an anti-social stew of class distinction, intellectual arrogance and sophomoric personal viewpoints.Jesse Eisenberg is excellent as the creator of Facebook. However, the amazing role in the film is that of the elitist Winklevoss twins. I don't like to read too much about a movie before I dive into the audience, so I had no clue that one actor, Armie Hammer, played both roles.Seen side-by-side in numerous scenes, there was even a thought in the back of my mind that the twins were close, but not really close enough. What a performance. A supporting Oscar nomination will hopefully follow.Distractions: the glamorization of the party scene at Harvard--I have my doubts. Perhaps it was just a way of emphasizing the fantasy that the computer guys were hoping to obtain? ...and the abrupt ending.It was almost as if a studio exec had said, well, not bad, but we're looking for a two-hour run time. And so...slice, stop, rolling credit explanation as to outcomes. A more natural ending would have been appreciated.But the anti-social nature of the networking is laid out brilliantly, through the Mason of the Harvard undergrads, to the coed user-consumer wannabes, to the don't care attitude of the Dean, to the use and discard context of many of the relationships.In the context of the suicide death of a Rutgers undergrad a few weeks ago after social network bullying, this film accurately tells of our times and directly questions its values.",9,9,16,12 October 2010
