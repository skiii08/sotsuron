The Blair Witch Project," HYPE
","American viewers must get scared easily because this film fails to live up to expectations.  It was such a good idea, but it certainly did leave me unsatisfied at the end.  Ignore the hype!!! but watch it anyway and judge for yourself...you'll probably agree with me!In its favour, it does try to be original, however an average film deserves an average mark... 5/10 then",1,17,33,7 August 2002
The Ring," Is it better than Ringu?
","I thought this film was pretty good.  Was pleasantly surprised that the film kept faithful to the original and also incorporated aspects from Ring 0 and Ring 2.  I still think I prefer the japanese version, although there is not much in it.  I thought Ringu had a greater sense of evil and darkness which The Ring kind of lacked. Like Ringu...no way near as scary as people say but distinguished nontheless...7/10 then",Null,0,1,11 July 2003
LÃ©on: The Professional," Touching
",This is a very stylish action film!! ok this film is not clever or anything but it it does what it needs to do well...which most films often fail to do!!!! the music is emotional and after watching it makes u feel empty and gives u a sudden taste for milk!! I personally thought the cut version was better as it was more succint which makes the film far better paced!! I think one of the charms of the relationship in the cut version was deciding for yourself if they were in love or what!! i liked the fact that it was more open to interpretation!!!bottom line though......an excellent film......... 9/10,9,0,1,29 January 2003
Spirited Away," Deserved winner of Best Animated film oscar
","This film reminds us that great animation is not about excessive CGI and overblown special effects, but is about sheer imagination and creativity.  I love how japanese animation makes serious issues about life accessible to children to understand, yet have a deeper level which adults can also appreciate through the symbolism and rich imagery.   Being enthralling for children and deep for adults makes this film exceptional.  Only negative would be the length which left some of the youngsters abit restless but the imagery really is  wonderful and will intruige even the the most cynical audience.  
In short escapism at its best....up there with the anime classics like grave of the fireflies!!9/10",10,1,2,10 July 2003
Independence Day," Tosh!!
",This film is nothing more than a special effects show.  The 'God Bless America' phases of the film are vomit-inducingly cheesy.9/10 if your american3/10 otherwise,3,1,3,7 August 2002
Grave of the Fireflies," Impressive
","Grave of the Fireflies is not JUST a cartoon, its a great film in its own right.  The animation is very subtle and the behaviour of the young girl is very well implemented.  The Japanese version should be the one of choice since the voice acting in some of the characters in the english version do spoil it a little.  I thought Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away were a tad too long but Grave of the fireflies is the perfect length at just under 90 minutes.  The score of the film also deserves a mention! in short an exceptional film!!9/10 for its time(8/10 by todays standards set by Spirited Away etc...)",Null,0,1,23 April 2003
Braveheart," great film
","Historical accuracy aside, this film succeeds in portraying the emotion and power to the audience.  Excellent battle sequences with an engrossing plot which draws you in.  You empathise with the characters.  James Horner's musical score is also exceptional and manages to stir emotion.  A triumph, hail William Wallace!! 8/10",9,3,5,7 August 2002
Gladiator," Ridley scott does it again!!
","I'm sick of ppl saying that this film isnt historically accurate!! who cares!!! The film makers are in the story-telling business, they're not history teachers!!! and ppl only say sparticus is better cos Kubrick is dead and they are too proud to admit that a new film can beat a classic!! The story is entertaining.  The characters are believable.  The computer graphics range from breath-taking to slightly out of synch.  The background score is exceptional and combined with usual Ridley Scott visual style, this film is a winner!!8/10",10,5,7,16 January 2003
