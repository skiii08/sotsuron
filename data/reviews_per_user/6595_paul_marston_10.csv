Skyfall," WOW - SIMPLY WOW - Daniel Craig Nails it as Bond !!!
","No film can EVER be perfect, hence Skyfall only gets a 9/10! Superb opening title sequence, and Bond showing his human side more than ever before.Strong final performance from Dame Judy as M, and her death scene at Bonds family estate was really moving. Also shows how moneypenny gets to where she is (qualified but not able as she sowed by accidentally shooting bond in the title sequence!) and Ralph ( its RALPH - Not Rayph!) will i'm sure be a superb replacement M! The new Q looks like he will from now on be a more prominent character.from the fabulous titles with Adele's haunting melodies to the re-invention, Sam Mendes should be a dead cert to make bond films from now on.Must be so frustrating the US not getting Skyfall til Nov 9, but hey its worth the wait! Spoilers or no - this is a SUPERB MUST SEE FILM IN IT'S OWN RIGHT!",9,4,17,29 October 2012
Captain America: Civil War," Highlights just how bad BvS was
","Civil war shows how an ensemble comic book hero movie SHOULD be done. The CGI in this movie didn't look like CGI - the airport scene - shows how a superhero movie with multiple main characters SHOULD be done! No doubt you've read all the critics reviews, and by and large they are RIGHT!But CGI alone cannot carry a film (again one of the major flaws in BvS). The story itself is compelling. You can watch this film and enjoy it without watching any other Marvel movie, but it is SO more satisfying to get all the backstory!Words wont do this movie justice - WATCH IT - ENJOY IT - you won't be disappointed!It gets 9/10 because NO film can ever be perfect!",9,10,22,29 April 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," So awful I LITERALLY fell asleep!
","Where can I begin with the 'superlatives' of how poor this film is? Way way too long, scant reference to the books (Considering the ONLY reason these stories are so popular was because of the strength of the writing!) a ridiculous and crass 'love' story. Add the criminal under use of Martin Freeman and the 'crimes' against Tolkien start to add up!No question the effects are stunning, but with technology as it is, even films with smaller budgets can have great CGI nowadays. Having stunning graphics simply isn't good enough any more! For the Tolkien purists they will be horrified to what they have done with the book. Seems film writers think they know the hobbit better than Tolkien - THEY ARE WRONG! No question people will watch this in their droves, and no question the final film will get a huge following. All I can hope for is that the final film is better than this, because this film STINKS",2,15,23,28 December 2013
Avengers: Infinity War," So much to pack into 1 film - should Infinity Wars have been a trilogy?
","First of all when I rate a film, I use this system for rating - 5 is a pass, 6-7 merit, 8+ distinction. I NEVER give a 10./10 because it's IMPOSSIBLE to make a perfect film. Thus my 8/10 would be 8.5 (distinction) if I could give half a star. Thus this film is VERY GOOD, but has a few issues.Because of the nature of the film, there are a LOT of characters, so inevitably some characters (2 in particular) is glossed over. Even Stan Lee's cameo was as brief as it could be (but considering his health that is understandable. This is the ULTIMATE crossover movie - virtually all marvel movie is represented in some way.To say this film is action packed is an understatement - if anything there is TOO much action - I could make a decent case this is 2 films rolled into 1 - hence the title of the review! Having said that, all action scenes were well done, and the issues re CGI I had against Black Panther weren't present here.As was shown in trailers, Thanos is on a quest to gather all the infinity stones to complete his plans for the universe. As such, Vision is a key target. We begin however in the cosmos with the Ragnarok survivors in a spot of bother. Loki shows his best & worst, and my appreciation for what Tom Hiddleston has done with this character is never higher than here. From here keeps flashing between earth & the cosmic realm - bringing into play the guardians.From here, it is standard MCU fair - if you've enjoyed any of the other movies, you will love this one. The big difference is Thanos - played fantastically by Cable - sorry Josh Brolin (nod to deadpoll ;-) ). and BOY has he done a fantastic job. All the claims that killmonger was the best villain in the MCU - are made to look VERY silly after watching Thanos. His plan is beyond diabolical, but the way he is played, it is quite possible to sympathise with him. Without saying WHAT he is trying to do, his motivations are to be benevolent! Whilst if he succeeded would be about as horrific as is possible, he doesn't do it to be evil destructive. In HIS mind, he is trying to prevent an even worse catastrophe! Yes the film plays it from Thanos's POV, and Thanos is taking a macro view of the universe! What is so great, is how Thanos is portrayed with a level of sympathy. It's as if Thanos doesn't WANT to do this, but he sees it a the only way to ultimately save the various species!I can see why people may not like this, there's things in here that I wouldn't have done. But for me, there is NO QUESTION this is an excellent film - but unlike many of the recent MCU films, no way could you consider this a romp! It's a complete tonal change from Ragnarok. And that is what I love about the whole MCU. They aren't afraid to change a working formula. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I've DELIBERATELY not discussed much, as this film needs to be seen - if nothing else Josh Brolin's performance. This DESERVES to make way much more money than Black Panther. When politics change, Black Panther will not date very will - Infinity War WILL in my view.the trailers fairly represent the movie. You like them, you WILL love this. Oh and Peter Dinklage shows why he is such a giant talent!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",8,15,38,26 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This has made me not want to watch another Star Wars movie!
","How could they got this SO wrong? I have been watching these from the very first day of release back in the 70's! I've spent months excited giddy with anticipation for the next Star Wars movie. I've been excited about every little thing about Star Wars.And yet the Last Jedi has changed all of that! It has turned into an SJW snoozefest about how powerful women are and how men are incompetent, cowardly or just plain evil. Does ANYONE think had Luke not been the core character of the first trilogy he would even be in this garbage?I'm all for strong female roles, but seriously {SPOILER} Leia does her superman impression - but looked like an action figure being thrown across the room! And what about Admiral Akhbar? What's with MILITARY leaders wearing ball gowns and purple hair? What's with second in commands going on suicide missions? What's with those suicide missions!!!I'm so disappointed - this was WORSE than the prequels. TWICE they had potentially powerful and interesting baddies - Snoke and Phasma - and they are just tossed aside.And then there are the porgs..... WOW at least the ewoks had a role, all the porgs were there for ,was to sell merchandise.The more I think about it, the more it's apparent that Star Wars is being turned into a soap opera - a BAD soap opera.No doubt it will make it's money back many times over, but it SHOULDN'T. GARBAGE like this has spat on the legacy that came before it. I appreciate things move on and attitudes change, but there is a REASON Star Wars is the largest franchise in cinematic history.Can ANYONE claim they would have become life long fans after watching this?And what's worse, is they have given an entire trilogy over to the culprit of this crime against cinema - Kennedy should be FIRED for this.Still what does my opinion matter? After all I've only been a fan for 40 years, bought the merchandise, the books the toys etc. BUT NO MORE. Kathleen Kennedy you've FINALLY managed to do something I never thought possible. You've made me not care about a star wars movie!SHAME ON YOU",1,3,4,17 December 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Pretentious Over Hyped Calptrap
","I could go into detail as to just how awful this film is, but I would rather throw a glass of water at the wall to watch the paint dry!I have no doubt that the actors enjoyed making this dross, and I have no doubt the technical aspects of the film making techniques are impressive (copying Hitchcock's attempt to make it as a single shot).HOWEVER, as a film goer, all I want to have is an entertaining film! And as a paying customer, this film didn't just fail, it failed MASSIVELY.It's a pretentious art-house film attacking films successful films / actors for daring to pander to what people want rather than what the actor's think is worthy!No doubt the makers thought it was a blistering insight into this world (it may well be), but IT IS JUST PLAIN DULL!THe fundamental film, is that it claims to be a comedy. Thing is IT WAS NOT FUNNY!If you like this art-house pretentious type of movie (anything with Edward Norton in basically), you will like this garbage.I half expected one of the Wilsons & Bill Murray popping up in cameos as they are want to do in this genre of film.I'd contain spoilers, but there is NOTHING to spoil, as spoiling implies there are good bits!Instantly forgettable Prententious GARBAGEAVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE",1,32,68,11 January 2015
Wonder Woman," DCEU finally gets it! Gal Gadot Was BORN for this!
","There was a lot of pressure put on this movie to deliver. and BOY did it deliver! The film covers the origin story of Wonder Woman to present day, spending the majority of the film split between her isolation on Paradise Island, and WWI Europe. The film gives all characters - even the 'minor' ones have some character development and depth.Gal Gadot was BORN for this role! Chris Pine was superb as Steve Trevor. If you enjoyed the trailers you will love the film! Patty Jenkins has put her stake in the ground. this is the NEW standard for superhero movies- MCU should take notice!I NEVER give 10/10, because no film can ever be perfect - but this is close!Whatever Patty Jenkins makes next - I shall watch!",9,31,66,2 June 2017
The Woman in Black," Radcliffe / Potter - more wooden then a forest of trees!
","Watching Harry Potter- SORRY Daniel Radcliffe I was reminded on the old spitting image sketch about Roger Moore.In it The Moore puppet's only facial expressions for all his emotions was either one or the other eyebrows lifting.It appears young Mr Potter / Radcliffe prescibes to the same 'method' acting school of thought. The guy just CANNOT do emotion!!!With the sound turned down you cannot tell if he is happy, sad, angry, afraid, or indeed whether he needs the loo! To say his acting is wooden is doing an injustice to trees! I'm sure he tries hard but he simply cannot do emotion. He is trying to play a grief stricken widower, but you can't help yourself thinking 10 points to griffindor! He has made multi multi millions from that franchise, so will never have to worry about working again, which is just as well as from the basis of this pile of horse's business, he is going to find it hard to get work! No doubt Harry Potter mania got him this gig, but this guy is NEVER EVER going to get an Oscar! But he might earn a few rotten tomatoes! AWFUL AWFUL PERFORMANCE - still I'm sure he's crying all the way to the bank!",2,5,7,14 November 2012
Black Panther," Marvel's Last Jedi - RIP stand alone superhero movies
","If I were able to post a one or two word review, it would either be agenda or uncanny valley. Everything I feared this film would do, it did. Indeed in a couple of places it even referred to the (*spoilers*?) the slave trade! Seriously? In the 21st century you are going to refer at least twice in the same film to the slave trade - which BTW if you follow the film's premise would NOT have affected Wakanda as they were cut off from the rest of the world!The main character of the film is T'Chala - a character so depressingly dour and serious, he could be a candidate for depression. You have his younger sister - who is CLEARLY being geared up as effectively riri from the comics - she WILL be the replacement for Tony Stark! To best describe her, she is a light hearted Q from thee James Bond films - I liked her, she was fun, lively, bright, as a character a real find.Andy Serkis was excellent, but far too underused - Michael B Jordan's 'big bad'? I understand the anger, I don't get his ultimate goal - makes NO sense. The female bodyguards were the nearest thing to Mary sues in the movie. Really - beating up men TWICE their size with the SAME military background?I MUST discuss the CGI. This is a MASSIVE problem.Sure Wakanda looks spectacular, but so did Asgard. It's the motion of the main characters that is the problem. It seems that whilst they can get stationary objects (buildings etc) virtually spot on now, the same can NOT be said for dynamic ones. If you have watched any of the trailers, you'll know what I mean when you see Black Panther do his somersault The dynamic CGI characters look crystal clear, whilst the real life objects have a faint blur to them. You can just see where the live action starts and the CGI ends. If the cars were CGI as well you wouldn't notice the difference so much, but it IS there, and because it seems 90% of this film is CGI, in the end it becomes very annoying.as for the claim that this is unlike any other Marvel film - I beg to differ - unless you refer to how insular the whole film is, as it is based almost entirely in Wakanda. Which could be acceptable, until you realise most of the action took place outside of wakanda - in the remaining 5-10% of the film!Winter Soldier was CONSIDERABLY better than this. Guardians was better and more fun! Avengers had greater scope.Ragnarok was funnier.I know EXACTLY who this film was geared for, and it was NOT for your typical Marvel comic book movie fan. it had good points, The tech wiz sis has major potential, Wakanda looked spectacular (if you ignore the poor water animations (the ripples in the water looked cut and paste, watch MOANA for how water can be animated!) The soundtrack bore no relation to the action (action scenes sounded the same as the quiet moments!). But the worst 'crime' was the agenda it pushed. There is NO Excuse for this, as they PROVED they can have strong storyline in Winter soldier.So if you want a film with a dour dreary lead character, lots of uncanny valley moments, and LOTS AND LOTS OF POLITICAL GRANDSTANDING with no payoff, then this is the film for you!Just remember The Godfather / Goodfellas / Star Wars / Schindler's List all barely broke 90%, yet THIS is supposed to be 100%! If you don't think the ratings for this are agenda driven, I've got a bridge to sell you!I do NOT want a Black Panther 2 - I think the days of single super hero movies are done",2,915,1718,15 February 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," I am torn - James bond or Kingsman - Gritty or SPECTACULAR? I simply LOVE this film!
","NO FILM can possibly get 10/10, because there can ALWAYS be an improvement! HOWEVER 9/10 is the maximum I EVER give a film (likes of Goodfellas & The Godfather get 9/10 from me!)I mean when out of the blue Mark Hammill appears as a British scientist, you KNOW you are in for something special!I cannot express just how refreshing this film is for the spy film genre!I'm torn on Samuel Jackson's character. As a megalomaniac then great it's Samuel Jackson for goodness sake! But that accent! It's amusing for a short while, but by the end the joke wore off. But that is a small price to pay - FOR GOODNESS SAKE THE BADDIE IS SAM JACKSON!!!!!If you are looking for an eat prey love of a tinker tailor, then this film is NOT the film for you!It is an escapism film - pure and simple! Will it impress the critics? WHO CARES!If you are a fan of Juno or french rom-coms then I'd guess you won't enjoy this!I would happily watch this again - as far as I am concerned I cannot give it higher praise!It isn't for everyone - but which film is?Catch it on the big screen - CANNOT WAIT for the sequel!Oh and I LOVE how the offer from the princess tips it hat to James Bond, and updates it BEAUTIFULLY!",9,3,11,5 February 2015
