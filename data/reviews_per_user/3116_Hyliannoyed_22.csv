Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Flawed, But With Plenty of Bright Spots
","Although Star Wars episodes 1-3 are often maligned and derided, they seem to be getting a bit of a reappraisal in recent years, especially in light of Disney's disjointed, unimaginative new trilogy. As someone who was never wild about 'The Phantom Menace', I wasn't expecting much when I went back to re-watch it, and I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, there is a lot to like here.For starters, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are both excellent. While Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are far from being my favorite actors, they do quite well with their respective characters very well. Darth Maul is also an interesting new villain, and the lightsaber duel at the end of the film is a highlight. The soundtrack is phenomenal, of course, and the effects, while not aging amazingly, were not as painful to look at as one might expect. There's a lot of action, and it's interesting to see the seeds of future conflict being sown by the plotline here.On the flipside, Jar Jar is, well... you know. An unintelligible moron who distracts from the other characters and the plot rather than enhances them. Also, little Anakin doesn't quite seem like future Sith material. However, I feel that any blame for this character should not be laid at the feet of Jake Lloyd, as he wasn't written with any darker undertones. I also don't blame Ahmed Best for Jar Jar.Despite some major failings, 'The Phantom Menace' is actually refreshing coming off the convoluted, dysfunctional trio of films Disney has added to Skywalker Saga. It may have some problems, but it's still Star Wars.",8,0,1,3 February 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The Only Time In History Where Stormtroopers Actually Fired In A Straight Line
","Heavily praised as an excellent prequel to the events of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Rogue One does have a lot going for it. The exposition provided turns a quick text blurb in the opening crawl of IV into a full-scale adventure, with great effects and some surprising twists. However, this is prequel-we-never-knew-we-needed is far from perfect. For one thing, the main cast is shockingly bland and lifeless as a whole. Felicity Jones' character, Jyn Erso, is incredibly boring, pre-programmed with a tragic backstory for sympathy, but lacking any real substance or character. It's hard to tell whether the actress or the writing are to blame, but it's probably a bit of both. Diego Luna's Cassian Andor is kind of a creep, and it's hard to sympathize with him after his actions early on in the film. With the exception of Donnie Yen and Alan Tudyk, who both bring some humor and personality to their roles, the rest of the ensemble is serviceable, but not stellar. This weak cast of characters makes what is intended to be a gut-wrenching finale, where they all bite the dust, to be less effective than it could be otherwise. Also, can we just appreciate that this may be the only time the Imperials are able to kill the main characters? Why did their aim get so much worse after this? Additionally, Darth Vader's Evil Villain Castle, complete with lava, is hysterically cliched, and the CGI-faces for Tarkin and Leia aren't quite believable yet, giving off a rather bizarre effect.Finally, amidst all this style, substance, and occasional cleverness, did this movie really need to exist, or is it just an attempt to milk the franchise dry? The number of 'Star Wars Stories' we get in the future will probably answer that question for us. Let's just hope Disney is smart enough to leave well enough alone, although I seriously doubt they will.",6,1,4,16 July 2019
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A Worthy Adaptation
","I must say that I'm surprised by how many negative reviews there are. Plenty of people are crying and screaming because of what they call 'religious propaganda', which is rather sad. The Chronicles of Narnia is an excellent fantasy series, and this adaptation, while not completely faithful, does a pretty decent job of bringing the story to life. It faithfully recreates the most important parts of the book, from tea with Mr. Tumnus to Aslan's triumphant return. It's not 'Harry Potter', it's not 'Percy Jackson', and thankfully, it's not tasteless schlock like 'His Dark Materials'. The acting, score, visuals, story, and morals all make this a very worthwhile way to spend an evening. It's a unique classic, and if you can't watch it because it triggers you, then you are missing out.",10,0,0,18 January 2020
The Polar Express," Creepy Yuletide Misfire (of Doom!)
","First of all, there's not really much to say about the plot. It's bloated and largely aimless for the majority of it's run time, as the source material was only a picture book. They should have left it alone.
At least, though, if they HAD to make a film of it, why did they use this animation style? It was painful even in later films such as the screwy adaptation of 'A Christmas Carol' or the mystifying absurdism of 'Mars Needs Moms'. Here, as it's an older film, the noticeably older motion capture technology is all the more demented in appearance. This is not, and will never be, a regular part of my Christmas movie schedule.",3,1,4,11 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A Mad Scramble of Cosmic Proportions
","As everyone already knows, 'The Rise of Skywalker' is the conclusion to one of the most erratic and ill-conceived trilogies in film history. 'The Force Awakens' was corporatized nostalgia, with a smidgeon of newer content and characters to make it palatable. Then, 'The Last Jedi' arrived, taking a massive dump on not only 'The Force Awakens', but the rest of the saga. Now, 'Rise of Skywalker' arrives, and it is painfully obvious that Disney did a mad scramble of cosmic proportions to tie up all the loose ends, fix the monumental mistakes of 'The Last Jedi', and make the fans happy. Question is, does it succeed?Ehhhh...I must admit that it was great fun watching the film slowly dismantle 'The Last Jedi' piece by piece. Holdo maneuver? One-in-a-million probability of success. Finn and Rose? No romance at all. Rey's parents? Her dad was Palpatine's son, not a nobody. It shreds Episode 8 with glee, and Mark Hamill is obviously relishing his main appearance, which dishes the take on Luke Skywalker in the previous film.Additionally, Rey, Finn, Poe, and Kylo Ren are probably done better here than in either of the other two films. There's also a sense that they did actually want to respect Luke, Han, Leia, and Lando, even without retconning the events of 7 and 8. Plus, the soundtrack is phenomenal. John Williams always delivers.However, the plot is extremely rushed, as others have stated. The film clips along at an alarming speed compared to the lackadaisical chase-scene that was 'The Last Jedi', but it's almost too packed. Some scenes are too short, such as Kylo Ren finding the Wayfinder and going to Exegol, while others were wasteful and unnecessary, such as the celebration scene at the end. Palpatine's return could have been handled worse, but it wasn't necessary. The new force powers are a little suspect. And ultimately, it's trying to bridge the gap between movies that literally do not, and can not, work with each other. The only way to make this trilogy cohesive would have been to completely redo 'The Last Jedi', and, if I'm being honest, 'The Force Awakens' as well. As it is, we're seeing the conclusion to a trilogy that we never actually saw, and it's frustrating.At the end of the day, I do think it could have been a lot worse, but it could have been a lot better. It's a middling adventure with some highs and plenty of lows. And while I did not hate most of it, I don't feel I can properly recommend it. My best advice: wait until it's at the Library or on Disney Plus.",7,5,10,28 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Messy, Somewhat Satisfying Conclusion
","After Infinity War, I must say that this movie comes as a fair bit of a disappointment. There's a fair amount to like, but a lot to hate as well. The completion of Iron Man's story, the return of Hawkeye and Ant-Man, and the increased time given Nebula are all huge bonuses. However, much of the film is muddled, dense, and borderline inane.As a huge Doctor Who fan, I'm used to the potential of paradoxes and contradictions presented by time-travel. However, after taking a dump on a huge selection of time-travel movies, including Back to the Future, we are then presented with the messiest time-travel mechanics I have ever seen. They say that whenever they go back in time, they create a new reality. Well, what about the old one? Is that one intact, or does it get destroyed? It all seems like a lazy cop-out so they can justify completely destroying the continuity of The Avengers (2012). Thor: The Dark World, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Also, having 2014 Nebula die simply doesn't make a lick of sense. Even more uninspired and convoluted is bringing the 2014 variant of Thanos and his children to the future, only for them to die in the future. This makes no sense, regardless of the 'new-reality' disclaimer they gave earlier in the movie. Additionally, when we finally get to see all the dead characters return, so much of the film was over that it felt tacked on rather than purposeful.Also, what on Earth is wrong with the Hulk? Why is Thor a hopeless, overweight drunk? Valkyrie was the one with drinking problems, last time I checked. What was the point of Captain Marvel? She did hardly anything, after all. Why is Cap swearing so much, and why do we have to watch his tedious little support group? Why did they completely avoid using Okoye for almost the entire movie? Why does everyone hate Star Lord suddenly? How did all those female Avengers manage to arrive in the same place at the same time without getting intercepted by Thanos' forces? And why does the random rat in the junkyard save the day?All in all, this could have been a worse film than it was, but it still was far from perfect. It really felt like the end of an era, and it made the idea of the universe continuing after such a major finale rather unappealing. It feels kinda arrogant, slimy, and out-of-touch, no doubt the result of so many box office successes finally going to Disney's head. Only time will tell if they can maintain the same level of quality and interest in the future, but I seriously doubt they will.",4,4,8,28 May 2019
Aladdin," Pretty Decent Overall
","I'm not going to lie: I'm not a big fan of Disney's new tactic of remaking their older animated films. Cinderella's remake was excellent, but outside of that, the others have felt fine at best. 2019's 'Aladdin' is one of the more interesting cases, as it makes a few improvements to the original, but also does some things worse. Overall, it's pretty much comparable to the original. Will Smith does quite well as the genie, and there's a nice twist for his character which was a welcome addition to the story. Additionally, Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott do pretty well with their roles overall. However, the score is comparatively weaker, with the newer takes on older songs not really matching up to their predecessors, and the one newer song feeling out of place with the others. Additionally, Jafar is not portrayed successfully, undermining a lot of the tension. As it stands, it's a decent remake that's worth a watch. It doesn't replace the original, but it does do a fair amount to differentiate itself.",7,2,2,31 December 2019
Call Me by Your Name," What Is Hollywood Trying To Normalize?
","Sickening. Absolutely sickening. Do you realize that an adult having relations with a minor is considered statutory rape in the USA, right? Even if things are different in other countries (which if they are, I really don't want to know) the fact that this thing isn't shunned in America is more than a little disturbing. Absolute trash.",1,14,60,13 August 2019
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A Happy Accident, or Inspired Lunacy?
","After avoiding this film for years (as a Christmas-loving lad who assumed it was all about trying to destroy my favorite holiday), I finally ended up watching this totally off-kilter film about the why Halloween and Christmas don't mix (take notes please, Krampus!) It's hard for me to get much of reading off of this one way or another. To be honest, it's incredibly ugly. I get that that serves the feel of Halloween Town and it's denizens perfectly, but considering that the Santa, his elves, and the regular humans are all pretty weird looking too, I'm left wondering how much of it was intentional. The music is also incredibly lopsided and strange, once again serving the plot and feel of the film well. At the same time, some of the songs are kind of grating, so who knows. At the end of the day, I can appreciate what they were trying to do, and I do find it kind of hilarious, in a weird sort of way. While not a huge fan, I don't really mind it either, and I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a strange diversion from the usual festive fare.",7,0,1,23 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Looks Good, Sounds Fine, Feels Wrong, Smells Fishy, and Leaves A Bitter Taste
","Well, after the paint-by-numbers The Force Awakens, I guess we should be thankful that The Last Jedi didn't rip-off The Empire Strikes Back. Umm, other than that, the music and visuals are good...? (I'm trying to be positive here!)Like The Force Awakens, I enjoyed the Last Jedi initially. It seemed a little fresher than its' predecessor, after all, and if you don't look to closely, it seems passable in places. However, considering the character-assassination of Luke and Leia, the weird, messed-up force abilities, the bizarre hyper-space ram, the lousy romances, the weak characters, the ham-fisted integration of social issues, the terrible villains, the lame plot-twists... the problems are myriad, and no amount of insulting the audience will hide that fact.",1,29,42,13 September 2019
Brave," Better Luck Next Time, Pixar
","Pixar's first (and hopefully, only) stab at making a princess movie has proved that they aren't very good at it. At it's simplest, Brave is an obnoxious film populated by unloveable caricatures of Scottish people. The narrative is childishly dull in its' execution: a particularly crabby princess named Merida is understandably displeased with the idea of an arranged marriage, and blames her mother for it. However, in the midst of her tantrum-throwing about it, she fails to realize that her mother is just trying to operate in a society where such things were unfortunately the norm, and isn't conspiring against her. Merida rashly visits a dotty witch to get something to change her mother, and is shocked when her mother doesn't change her mind, but instead turns into a bear. What follows is a tedious series of adventures in the woods, culminating in a battle with an inexplicable evil bear and a sappy happy ending. The men are pretty much all depicted as being stupid and hideous for effect, but this doesn't help us see the plight of the protagonist. On the contrary, Merida is largely insufferable herself, callously gambling with her own mother to get want she wants. The only person you can understand or sympathize with is her mother, and that's literally it. Overall, the film is ugly, cliched, and poorly written, and I don't recommend it to anyone.",3,0,2,23 July 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Whedon Screws This One Up Big-Time
","The 2nd of Marvel's mega cross-overs, Age of Ultron does not even come close to living up to it's predecessor. To get the good stuff out of the way, the basic idea of the villain isn't terrible, but it does seem like something for a smaller film than the Avengers. Also, Hawkeye finally gets some decent character development, and we see that he's actually a pretty caring family man. There's also a bit of humor with the 'lifting Thor's hammer' scene. That is about where the positives end, however.For starters, the new characters are mostly awful. Ultron, despite having an interesting premise, is totally stupid. His incessant posturing, pretending to be God, is tiresome, and he never uses his full potential (watch HISHE to see what I mean). Quicksilver is utilized terribly, and the I find it ironic that character with super-speed is ultimately the one who dies from a bullet. Worst of all is Vision, the magenta-monstrosity that also thinks itself to be God and is completely and utterly moronic in every way.As if this wasn't bad enough, the original cast is also handled poorly. Thor's pseudo-mythology is at it's worst, with a ridiculous bathing scene in a dank cave somewhere that is poorly explained and painful to watch. Viler yet is the 'romance' between Hulk and Black Widow, which comes out of nowhere and is super, super cringey. It makes Anakin and Padme look amazing by comparison. Finally, Tony Starks arrogance goes too far this time, creating the whole miserable mess in which the characters find themselves.In conclusion, this is a train-wreck; a dreadfully inane and vapid sequel which has no right to be as bad as it is. It's telling that 2016's Captain America: Civil War feels more like an Avengers film than this one does.",4,0,0,20 August 2019
Avatar," (Limited) Style Over (Nonexistant) Substance
","Dull, vapid, lifeless, and unrealistic. Tribal forces couldn't take out a futuristic military force! The Na'vi are ugly as sin, (the eyes seem uncannily similar to Gollum's) and the effects are... overrated. It's a shame that this ended up as the highest grossing movie of all time.",1,3,5,8 February 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Interesting New King Kong Film with a Couple Weak Spots
","A mostly enjoyable monster-romp, Kong: Skull Island is a fun and unique film for the 80+-year-old ape franchise. There's a lot to like, with some wild creature encounters and a very different plot than we've seen before. However, the cast is very crowded, and most don't really get time to shine. Still, they mostly do well with what they are given. That being said, the only real disappointment is Brie Larson, who's character brings nothing to the table. It's also a little bit gory in places, compared to the usual building-wrecking and explosions we've come to expect from giant monster films. Still, though, it's worth a watch for any monster-movie fan.",8,1,2,10 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Last Truly Great Star Wars Film
","Say what you will about Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. Menace seemed boring to me as a child, and I never really cared for it. Clones is a fun, imaginative blockbuster hampered by a somewhat stilted romance, which takes up enough of the run time to ruin it for many. However, the prequel trilogy definitely ends on a high with Revenge of the Sith; the darkest, most high-stakes Star Wars film yet, and the only one to come near the quality of A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, in my humble opinion. The worlds, the aliens, the villains, the battles, the soundtrack, the story... everything comes together to make a satisfying conclusion to the prequel trilogy, and I do feel that this may be the last truly great Star Wars film we'll ever see, especially considering the franchise's current trajectory.",10,2,3,11 November 2019
Finding Dory," A Very Fishy Cash-Grab
","Man, this is a pretty dark decade for Pixar. Brave and Cars 2 were really disastrous overall, and this is yet another disappointment from the formerly great studio. The plot is serviceable, but relatively mindless. Dory suddenly remembers her parents, so she, Marlin, and Nemo go to look for them. It's pretty vapid, though, with tons of obnoxious new characters, and only the occasional flashback to Dory as an infant providing any sort of emotion. Additionally, the entire final act is a tiresome series of characters getting captured and/or put into dangerous situations over and over and over, and the scenarios get increasingly ridiculous until we end up with a seven-tentacled octopus driving a truck full of fish off of a cliff and into the sea. The humans are all pretty dull, from the oblivious workers at the aquarium to the dimwitted guests who seem to think that the octopus is actually a human baby for a minute. Finally, there was some discussion about how two characters who appeared to be mentally disabled were treated like garbage and played for laughs. While I'm not usually looking for stuff to be offended about in films, this was kind of a shocking inclusion for the company, and shows that they've become pretty unscrupulous and lazy. Overall, this is just a fishy cash-grab that has no real reason to exist. Ellen DeGeneres' Dory is a character who gets old quickly, so let's hope there aren't any more 'Finding Fish' films in the works at Pixar.",4,0,1,23 July 2019
The Iron Giant," A Definitive Classic
","The Iron Giant is definitely one of the early examples of the quality shift from Disney to other studios that began in the late 1990's and continued throughout the next decade. It's delightful, sentimental, funny, and well thought-out, and the animation, music, and voice-acting suit each other perfectly. The only minor gripe I have is that it feels a tad anti-military at some points. It's also worth noting that many of the themes are more adult-oriented than child-oriented, though in most of these instances, that serves to improve the quality. All in all, this is a highly recommended film for anyone who is a fan of quality animated movies.",10,1,2,23 July 2019
Godzilla," Pretty Good Overall!
","This is definitely a strong start to the American monster-verse franchise, with great action and an exciting plot which sees the King of the Monsters at his most heroic. The new Kaiju leave a bit to be desired, as I'd have loved to see one of the other classic monsters fight it out in their stead, but they're still interesting additions to the story. Definitely worth a watch for any fan of the classic Godzilla films.",9,0,2,10 March 2019
Contact," Is It Weird That I Find This Kinda Laughable?
","It is very obvious that Contact is intended to be profound. It's long, it's plodding, and it's a little bit trippy, to be honest. But does it succeed in it's narrative? I'd say no.
We begin making contact with aliens when they send back a broadcast of Hitler at a Nazi rally. Yuck! Why this isn't taken as a warning sign is beyond me, but I guess the aliens haven't brushed up on Earth history. Oh well. What ensues is a rather silly 'religion bad, science good' narrative that basically sets the aliens up as some kind of deity. See the logical inconsistency? It's kinda funny, in a depressing sort of way. The aliens string humanity along until we build a machine to allow us to meet them, but the evil, backwards religious people blow it sky high. But don't worry! We had a back up. The main character meets the magical aliens on a magical beach, and no one believes her. The end!The film feels very self-important, and obviously takes itself WAY too seriously. The leads are bland and uninteresting, and the supporting cast of characters gets tiresome quickly. The narrative is vapid and lackadaisical, and it's too long.
Contact may not be the worst sci-fi film, but it's certainly a far cry from being the best.",4,2,5,18 September 2019
Pocahontas," Stick to Fiction, Disney
","Despite the Disney Renaissance being considered to last from 1989's 'The Little Mermaid' to 1999's 'Tarzan', there's one huge mistake squatting right, smack-dab in the middle of this era: 1995's 'Pocahontas', a shockingly bad movie that might actually be the worst Disney animated film so far.Honestly, the film is just crappy all around. Musically, some of the songs are decent, but the lyrics are pretty poor, making them kind of a pain to listen to. Animation wise, it's fine, but it's not Disney's best work. And the 'story' is an inaccurate joke that goes far beyond 'artistic license' territory and off the deep end into borderline character-assassination of actual people. Probably the least accurate depiction is that of Governor Ratcliffe. Look him up: even Wikipedia tells you everything you need to know. It hardly seems fair to set him up as yet another ugly, stupid Disney villain, considering his shockingly gruesome death. Feeling guilty yet, Disney?At the end of the day, 'Pocahontas' is vapid junk. It doesn't even begin to compare with the previous films of the Renaissance era, or with it's successors. It should be forgotten as just another dimwitted, clunky look at colonialism without anything original to say.",2,0,3,17 December 2019
Princess Mononoke," A Dark Masterpiece
","In many of it's other films, Studio Ghibli has excelled in telling small, thoughtful, and personal stories. Amongst such films as 'Kiki's Delivery Service' and 'Whisper of the Heart', 'Princess Mononoke' is an anomaly. It is an intense, dark story about total, irredeemable war between a group of careless humans and the bloodthirsty protectors and armies of nature. The animation is breathtaking, the score is fantastic, the characters are complex, and the story is intriguing. Both sides are treated with nuance, avoiding the crappy, dim-witted one-sidedness of films such as James Cameron's 'Avatar'. Indeed, this serves to raise the stakes as both sides wage a bitter war. Additionally, the true protagonist of the story, Ashitaka, is one of Studio Ghibli's finest leads, tirelessly working to stop the needless bloodshed as the story rushes towards it's shocking climax. While the dark themes, gore, and minor language may be a turn off for many fans of Ghibli's usual fare, 'Princess Mononoke' is a unique, dark masterpiece.",Null,1,1,31 December 2019
Beetlejuice," Tim Burton's Worst
","Despite there being some potential in the idea behind this movie, the end product is grotesque and unpleasant, and fails in most of its' attempts at humor. To get the positives out of the way, Winona Ryder does succeed in her portrayal of the quintessential emo-teenager. Catherine O'Hara also does pretty well with her character, but this is where the positives end. The overall aesthetic is unique, but often not in a good way, and usually ends up being an eyesore. The humor is largely sadistic in a very cringey sort of way, leading to a rather uncomfortable viewing experience. As a whole, it seems to cross over from 'artistic vision' into 'self-indulgence' territory.And the cherry on top of this mess is Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice: an utterly loathsome and repulsive creation who drags every scene he's in into pervert territory. He's loud, obnoxious, uncouth, crass, and nauseatingly vulgar, and the overall weakness of the vast majority of the main cast, especially the main couple, means no one is able to counterbalance his vile persona. This is the ultimate failing of Beetlejuice: The namesake, and center of everything, is impossible to view with anything other than absolute revulsion. Not amusement, not enjoyment, not intimidation, just utter, abject loathing. Maybe this was the ultimate intent, but considering he doesn't even illicit a giggle, I'd say the whole thing is a pretty major failure, in my book.",2,0,2,22 July 2019
