The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project was over hyped, over compared and made me sick to my stomach.
","Silence of the Lambs was the best thriller movie I have ever seen and had been highly compared to the quality of The Blair Witch Project. So, admittedly, my expectations were pretty high. The Blair Witch Project is a documentary of the legend of the Blair Witch that is filmed by three college students. The movie itself is made up of the actual tape and film that they shot on their handheld camcorder and movie camera. Upon interviewing the locals they attempt to find the Blair Witch deep in the woods. Eventually, they lose their map, get lost and the characters become pretty scared, although I did not. This movie really had nothing to do with being a scary film and more to do with how angry the characters become with each other for being lost in the woods and to see how many times they can use the `F' word. Furthering my disappointment was that ninety percent of the film is dedicated to shots of the forest floor as they are running about hysterically. So all you really every see is leaves and twigs and dirt shaking violently on the screen. This new trend in filmmaking is an empty attempt to portray the movie through the viewer's own eyes and left me with an upset stomach for hours afterwards. It was so bad that I counted at least a dozen other people who had to leave the movie altogether. If Breaking the Waves made you even slightly squeamish, then don't see Blair Witch unless you want to barf in your neighbor's popcorn bag. This movie had neither clever acting nor an interesting plot and it came no where close to putting you on the edge of your seat like Silence of the Lambs did. The only good thing about Blair Witch was the end, when the torture was finally over.",4,0,2,3 August 1999
