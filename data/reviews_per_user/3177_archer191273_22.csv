Catch Me If You Can," A true story that is fun and entertaining!
","This is the story of Frank Abagnale. A con artist, forger and imposter who from the age of 15 to 21 stole millions while eluding the FBI. He posed as a pilot, physician and even had a go at a US bureau of prisons agent.
This is by far 1 of my favourite stories with the most unlikely of outcomes for such a grand thief. Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks are both as usual great in this film. A must see movie that shows how unlikely and un predictable life can really be. Very entertaining!!",10,0,1,16 September 2019
Raiders of the Lost Ark," a movie that has it all.
","Some say that the last crusade is the best of this saga but I beg to differ. This is a truly memorable piece of cinema and also in my opinion, 1 of the greatest films ever made.Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones who is a part time teacher in archeology and a full time hunter of historical treasures and is presented by his colleagues a search like nothing he has ever gone after. The Ark of the covenant but he must contend with Adolph Hitlers men and a Frenchman who is as ruthless and cold blooded as Hitler himself but the question is. What menacing power does the Ark behold and how dangerous is it to anyone who dares to open it. This was and still is 1 of my all time favouritesThis is a movie to be remembered that has all the elements and originality of a truly great movie. It has it all if you haven't seen it. Get your popcorn and expect something that will grip you, make you laugh and scare the hell out of you too. A must see.",10,1,2,21 March 2016
Moana," So many moronic, self made critics on this site!
","Forget the idiots who think they know it all and think they're aim ass movie critics. Movies are meant to be fun to watch. Especially family movies and this 1 is no exception thaat is beautifully designed & animated. 
Set in the Hawaiian islands. Moana is an adventurous girl who is befriended by the ocean and is chosen to deliver te fitis heart along with maui across the ocean and restore life and ebb the growth of darkness from spreading across the earth and with hei hei the hilariously dumb rooster she embarks on her adventure against the chiefs (her fathers) wishes.
My daughter, my family and i absolutely adore this movie. A visual splendour it is. 
I've found a lot of viewers on imdb to be analytic morons who've forgotten how it is to enjoy a movie and get it so wrong, so many times!!!
Be the judge yourself.
Well worth watching.",10,1,3,28 December 2017
The Polar Express," ignore those vile people who don't feel the Christmas spirit.
","If you feel the Xmas spirit like I do, you'll love this film and your kids will love it more! My daughter and I watch this flick every year near Christmas and it never gets boring. Robert Zemickis captures the Christmas spirit in this beautiful film about a boy who is struggling to believe in Santa Claus and gets chosen to take a ride to the North pole on board the Polar Express. An enchanted train that takes on an adventure that will be the night of his life. The visual effects are stunning and Tom Hanks is his as usual great playing several characters. This film renews the good old days of those Rankin Bass cartoons that we all loved for many more generations to come. Anyone who wants to make the holiday season special for their kids must get this movie. It is very special to myself, my daughter and any child who watches it. Well done and amazing!! Please make more Mr Zemeckis!!",10,1,2,25 November 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Oh dear. I can't believe how diisapointed I am. So dissapointed. I wanted to cry.
","I'd tell the story I saw but it was all so confusing. I can't believe how high the garbage has been rated!!! I have seen every marvel movie that has been release and watched and liked Infinity war though I thought it dragged on. No super hero movie should ever go for more than 2 hours...EVER. Now it has dawned on me that disney and the writers of this flick had nothing but cash in mind when planning these. The first Avengers was amazing, i believed that age of ultron was the forerunner for something epic with Thanos then these 2 movies were just a massive let down but it's all about cash and I took the bait. Hook, line and sinker. A final movie is supposed to give all the answers but this just gave me so many questions and left me confused and wondering whether I loved or hated it. Now it has sunk in and I gave it thought i just hate it. Too many contradictions. Don't get me wrong. The action is good in this movie and there are parts I loved about it but the parts i hate out weighed them. Damn you Disney!!!!",4,24,35,7 May 2019
Saving Private Ryan," greatest war movie ever made!
","I have always enjoyed most of Spielbergs movies like E.T, goonies, the mind blowing Jurassic park and of course saving private Ryan. Never has a movie stirred such emotions in me of sadness and awe. From the moment the movie begins, so does the true horror of war itself. I've never been to war but this movie, I believe had given me a good idea of what a soldier in action goes through. The first 45 minutes left me feeling horrified and sick and so did the scene where the runner gets shot down then finished off in a barrage of bullets. It is a bloodthirsty flick but war is hell and this movie captures that. Tom Hanks performance is by far his best as an officer who suffers from a form of shell shock and as his job requires, has to hide his emotions from his troops even though the loss of his men to save 1 whose brothers have all fallen in the heat of battle cannot be justified. The finally also is horrific and Spielberg did an amazing job capturing the horror of war. 1 of the best films and cinematic experiences I have ever seen. 10 out of 10 for me. Spielberg is the greatest director of all time. A must see to teach us why we must be reluctant to go to war. War horse also is the best depiction of the great war I've seen too. Another Spielberg great.",10,2,4,11 January 2014
X-Men: The Last Stand," Hah?
",I have come to the conclusion that people on this site have taste where the sun doesn't shine. I actually think that this movie is the best in the whole franchise. I guess you'll have to watch it and be the judge yourself. Do yourself a favour and don't go off the stinky reviews on imdb. These morons are self proclaimed movie critics. I have more taste in my johnson.,10,2,2,9 June 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Everybody on this site seriously thinks they're a critiv
",It's fun to watch. I loved it. Compared to the last edition to this series it is great. No spoilers. Just watch it and be the judge yourself. Half of the idiots on this site tale themselves a bit too seriously.,8,0,1,3 January 2018
Coco," A beautifully original story and food for the eyes.
","I went to see this movie with my daughter being very sceptical as I've seen plenty of misses in animated movies as well as some beauties. I must say i was very pleasantly surprised at how great this movie was with an original storyline! The audience (especially parents) applauded it now how often does a movie get a round of applause these days?
I won't add any spoilers because this movie is a must, must watch for families and it will be regarded as 1 of the greats in animated movies and the stray dog is hilarious!
As a dad and a father i regretfully say i found it really hard to fight back tears. It will make you laugh and maybe even cry and is extremely entertaining. 
A favourite for many years to come.
If you have kids. Take them to see it. Please!!",10,0,2,5 January 2018
1917," A visual feast like I've never seen!!
","This is set to be 1 of the greats. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, the score is haunting and everything about this movie is great!!In the later days of the great war. 2 British corporals are given the task of delivering a message to a battalion miles away before its charge will end in disaster by the awaiting German trap. 1 of the Corporals brothers is in this battalion making it a much more desperate mission for the Lads. This is a story of the difficulties the men face on their extremely treacherous mission.Might I add that the scenes in no mans land are the most horrific I've scene to date. This film manages to capture to true horror that was the great war. Nothing great about it. Just anguish, horror, grief and misery that our forefathers endured. A couple of touching moments too but the true star of the movie was the genius of cinematography that is a true feat on it's own added by great performances by Dean-Charles Chapman and George Mackay accompanied by an acceptional script. The best ww1 movie to date.",10,0,3,26 January 2020
Evil Dead," I have to get out of here.
",Don't listen to the haters of this movie. They were too faint to watch it through. I watched the original at 10 years old and it didn't really scare me but honestly. This remake has some truly horrific parts and good performances from the cast (unlike the original). If you're not into extremely violant movies. Do not watch this. It is vulgarly amazing!! It does deviate from the 80s classic but not enough to do it injustice. A must see for true horror fans.,10,0,2,7 April 2018
Jurassic World," well worth viewing. fun to watch.
","I don't know why viewers are giving this movie such a schlocking. My wife and I went to see it and really enjoyed it. It's suspenseful, funny and sometimes quite scary.22 years after the jurassic park disaster, jurassic world is running in good order but to boost revenue for investors, the park scientist begin breeding genetically enhanced monsters to spike the parks earnings creating another recipe for disaster.The real stars once again are the dinosaurs in this flick and there are excellent performances from the cast. This film didn't have the same, awesome impact on me as the original but that was when cgi was all new and special effects blew us all away but saying that it's a very fun and enjoyable movie to watch so sit back and enjoy the 2 hours of this film because we loved it. As a matter of fact. I'd go and see it again.",9,9,27,19 July 2015
La La Land," The people giving reviews here AND the critics are in la la land
",Absolute rubbish. Not even worth my words. Other people here must be on drugs. Crap.,2,2,4,8 April 2019
How to Train Your Dragon," Touching, exciting and the mighty toothless!
","A true masterpiece from dreamworks. This is a movie that will be loved by many generations to come. The visuals are stunning and the storyline is an outstanding achievement. I'll only write a review if I enjoy a movie and this is no exception.
A village of vikings is continuously raided by dragons for their food and the towns runt (Hiccup) who isn't allowed to help fight them off (because of his size) is determined to win his fame by killing the most feared (and never seen) dragon of them all. The night fury. After he uses a self made device Hiccup has his opportunity kill it and win the hearts of his village and the girl of his dreams (Astrid) but sees something deeper than the mindless monsters that he has been bought up to believe them to be.
After winning the night furys trust, a friendship blossoms but Hiccup needs to somehow convince his village and his father (Stoick the vast) that these creatures are stealing from them for a much, much more menacing reason.
My family and i love this movie. It has all the ingredients to make the perfect piece of entertainment for a great film. I especially love the touching scene where Hiccup actually manages to win Astrid's heart. An unforgettable moment with amazing visuals and music. If you haven't seen this with your family. You are depriving them of an unforgettable experience.",10,0,0,30 June 2018
Titanic," Absolutely beautiful movie. A Cameron masterpiece.
","This story follows Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio). A poor artist who wins his ticket onboard the Titanic in a card game who meets Rose (Kate Winslet). A beautiful young woman who is raised in an uppercrust society who sees her life as too predictable and in control by her pompous buffoon fiamce Cal (Billy Zane) and craves a life of somewhat uncertainty. When Rose meets Jack an unlikely romance blossoms as the Titanic embarks on it's ill fated maiden voyage.
Cameron truly put in a lot of hard work to create an absolute masterpiece here. Yes the movie has flaws but what movie doesn't? I love how he made what could of been a dreary and gloomy drag of a movie and turned it into quite an up beat story (up until Titanic strikes the ice berg). This is in my favourites. And ignites a fascination for the tragic story that is the Titanic. So sad and outrageous how mostly third class passengers died in this disaster.",10,5,6,28 January 2019
The Green Mile," How can a fictional story move a grown man to tears?
","Paul Edgecombe is the chief of a prison of capital punishment where inmates walk the green mile to their deaths. One day an inmate named John Coffey enters the prison of whom is a simple man but will touch the lives of Paul and every guard of whom works in the prison. John Coffey is a simple man but is in fact a miracle of God.
Many movies how nearly moved me to tears but this 1 definitely made me cry. It has every aspect that a great movie needs to be great. Funny moments and incredibly sad accompanied with heart warming scenes. This is 1 of hollywoods greats.",10,0,0,29 February 2020
The Water Diviner," The reviews here are from brainless halfwits. Really???!!!
",Wtf?!! I thought this rubbish was going to be a riveting movie about the tragic loss of a whole generation at Gallipoli. Instead we get a movie about Russell Crowe. I think it was poorly cast and the only great piece of acting was from Ryan Corr who was brilliant might I add. Other than that this movie was based on Rusty's giant ego and even bigger head. Don't get me wrong. Russell Crowe has done some of the greatest acting I have ever seen in a beautiful mind and romper stomper but as a director and producer. I'm afraid his ego got the better of him in this 1. What are these morons who reviewed this movie thinking?!! It's crap!!!,3,0,2,21 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," some people have taste in their butts.
",I don't know why this movie has been bagged so much by viewers. Maybe they think their view is more important than the professionals. I think not. This is a fun movie to watch and it follows the tradition and goes back to what the originals are meant to be.. FUN!! The new order (conceived from the dark side) is on the hunt for Luke Skywalker led by his former apprentice Kylo Ren. The best pilot in the resistance manages to hide the map in the most lovable droid bb-8 and the droid ends up in the hands of scavenger (with a good and kind heart) Rey so the hunt begins. Finn who is a clone storm trooper who has developed a conscience taken the side of good joins forces with Rey to escape its evil clutches but there is something powerful about Rey we don't know yet. The force is extremely strong with her.The 1 thing that is important to me is if a movie is fun and this movie is great fun to watch. I loved it. I guess some people Anylise movies too closely. It's a wonder they're not nuts! My opinion. GREAT MOVIE!!!! Can't wait for the rest.,8,2,30,11 April 2016
Deadpool," the best movie I've seen in ages! hilarious! this is all Ryan Renolds.
","An ex special forces mercenary who finds love is diagnosed with cancer and out of desperation to live with his new found love, accepts an offer in a dodgy experiment to become a mutant with super healing powers to cure his illness but the price is literally hideous and atrociously torturous so Deadpool is born and he sets out on a rampage for revenge on the people who so deceitfully made him the thing he has become.Anyone who doesn't like this movie has a very dismal sense of humour. It's so hilarious and Ryan Renolds gets let lose in his hilarity in this. This part is made for him like iron man for Robert Downey Jr. It is much more violent and explicit than the usual Xmen franchise but it's part of the entertainment for Deadpool is no hero nor a bad guy either. I found myself crying with laughter. This is such an off beat unpredictable movie. I loved it. Not for kids folks. That's for sure. Another fantastic Marvel flick!!",Null,2,7,4 June 2016
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Nightmarish yet sad film about how eternal life and damnation is overrated and has pitfalls.
","During the late 18th century Louis (Brad Pitt) tragically loses his wife and child. He can't take the grief of losing them so sets out to make himself the target for murder. Unfortunately it's a vampire that accepts his invitation that of the monstrous Lestat. Lestat invites Louis to accompany him in the afterlife and with regret Louis accepts and endures Lestats murderous lifestyle but unlike most vampires. Louis has carried his emotions and regret with him.
The interview comes about when a reporter (Christian Slater) stumbles across Louis path and instead of making him a meal. Louis decides to give him the story about his unnaturally long life.
This isn't a horror story but more of a biography about a vampires sad afterlife and losses. I believe despite his great looks that Brad Pitt is 1 of hollywoods best and what an amazing performance by Tom Cruise as Lestat! He doesn't nearly fit the part but pulled it off so well. Kirsten Dunst is so incredibly great aswell as Cluadia. A vampire that was made too young and despite gathering the wisdom of a middle aged lady still keeps her child form. 1 of the best child performances that I have ever seen. That's what makes this such a great movie. Each actor has put in the hard work to make their parts great in this movie and you can't help but feel such sorrow for poor Louis despite being what we see as a monster. A must see.",9,0,1,24 February 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," What rubbish!! Critics are on lsd!!
","How could anyone honestly rate this crap well to the amazing originals? This crud isn't even a pinch on the 80s movies and Mel Gibson was fantastic in them. This new bloke whatever the hell his name is tries to pass off a pitiful Australian accent and sounds more like a cross between a South African and a New Zealander not to mention he has no heroic qualities in this movie. He's more like the enemies then the girls bitch. A victim describes his character better.
I'm not even going to talk about the garbage plot.
You know what George Miller missed in this movie? Byron Kennedy who i now believe had the ingenuity of a story teller for the mad max series.
Soooo disappointing! If i could give it -10, i would.
Crap!!!!",1,7,13,19 March 2018
Jurassic Park," such an experience!!
",This movie was the greatest cinema experience I have ever had. The suspense goes from beginning to end. I especially love the scene where the t-Rex comes in the night. The sound of the thunder in its footsteps. The disturbed water. The mirror shuttering from the impact. There is so many great parts of this movie and the sound is amazing. Truly the best cinematic experience I have had. Great performances from all the cast and it is very scary! Not really for younger children but teenagers are sure to love it. Timeless. Spielberg has done it again. I think he is a movie genius. I still watch it 20 years after its release.,10,1,1,10 January 2014
