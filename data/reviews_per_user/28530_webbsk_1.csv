E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Okay if you're 5
","This movie was okay when I saw it at 5 years old, but at that time I found it sort of difficult to understand and rather scary. Now that I watch it and I'm 25, I can saw that it without question totally sucks. It's boring and sickeningly sweet. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone of any age because there are so many better children's films out there that are more enjoyable for the whole family. Go rent Shrek or Toy Story. Do yourself a favour and skip this movie unless you have ABSOLUTELY nothing better to do!",2,15,34,28 October 2002
