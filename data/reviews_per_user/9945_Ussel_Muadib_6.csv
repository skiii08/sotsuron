Skyfall," ZZZ Such a disappointment
",What can I say about the new film. It started in a normal Bond-like film and I thought we were going to be in for an action packed Bond film. But it all went down hill after that. Like previous posts have said what ever happened to 'the list'. Was it recovered? or is out there still kicking about?Also is Bond in the frame of mind that he watches someone kill someone...before he attacks him. I don't know...there was something lacking in this film that makes it a excellent bond film.I liked the new Q as he was quite funny and Dame Judy was awesome as always. Apart from that a mediocre film that I don't think will be added to my Blu Ray collection when it comes out.Such a shame,4,16,33,3 December 2012
Gravity," Gravity comes down to Earth with a BUMP
",I have read several reviews on this film and am wondering 'maybe this wasn't what I was expecting'.Sure it starts off fast paced and a bit of action but slowly goes downhill from there. Clooney and Bullock are the only 2 people in the film which makes it a tad boring. Sure Bullock's performance when she is alone is very heartfelt but just watching 1 person float around and around (with the camera moving too makes you a bit sick) it just doesn't do anything for me. When it finally ended I thought what a waste of 91 mins. It had a slightly climatic ending but then ....nothing. 90 or so mins of watching them float in space...not exactly a film that keeps you interested (well me anyway),2,4,8,2 January 2014
About Time," Richard Curtis does it again
",To start...any film with the gorgeous Rachel McAdams is on to a winner! I initially thought 'Curtis doing a Sci-Fi' and was a bit worried this might distract from the story...however the time travel was simple (no computer generated graphics or anything fancy like that) but it worked well and didn't detract from the story line at all.Its one of those films that has some great comedy but also has some lovely heart felt parts...especially when Tim goes back to see his dad 1 last time (this had me in tears).A lovely story with a lovely ending...really gives you perspective at your own life and to make the most of each day as it comes.10/10,10,2,3,2 January 2014
Now You See Me," Better than I thought
","I was very surprised by this film. Those of you who love films with a twist (and this film has a great one at the end ) such as the Illusionist (2006) will love this film.This film has a great cast and lots of action and magic.I think where the film could have expanded on was the ending. For those of you who have seen it will understand what I mean. Complete suspense, excellent story and effects right up to the end then....what next??However its the kind of film I would like to watch again as I'm sure by watching it a second time you will see things you didn't see the 1st time (again like the aforementioned Illusionist)",9,0,3,3 July 2013
Frozen," 'Let It Go' to the Oscars!
",After seeing the trailer for this movie I thought I would see it as I loved Tangled. This is a animated musical of 2 sisters who's parents are sadly killed at the beginning and have no one else but each other. The song 'Do you want to build a snowman' is very moving and time lapses Anna and Elsa from children to adulthood where Elsa becomes queen.I had not seen the cast list of this movie but when Elsa sang 'Let It Go' I immediately thought 'that sounds like Idina Menzel' as I thought she was awesome in Wicked and have her albums.....sure enough a quick look on IMDb and this confirmed she did the voice for Elsa.The film continues with the excellent soundtrack (already got it on order) and has a mixture of funny (Olaf..love that snowman!) scary and sad bits.A Disney A* movie that deserves some recognition.,10,2,10,2 January 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Hunger Games is heating up
",I have read all the HG books and was disappointed with the 1st film missing out a lot of info that was in the book.The 2nd film stays as close to the book as possible (with a few bits missed out) but nothing too drastic. I guess they had to trim the book down to convert it to the screen. It starts with Katniss and Peeta visiting each of the districts (very sad when going to Rue's district) but before they know it they are then both thrown back into the arena.Some excellent acting and nice to see Peeta and Katniss working with others in a team rather than each to their own.We learn a little bit about District 13 and the film has a heck of a cliff hanger (roll on Mockingjay!) Good job to all and cant wait for the next installment.,9,1,15,2 January 2014
