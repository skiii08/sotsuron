Catch Me If You Can," An all-around perfect mixture of fun, drama and suaveness
","This is such an all-around exciting, fun movie that you could watch over and over again and never tire of. It's an interesting, light-hearted look at the true story of an extremely clever con artist, and full of great performances. Christopher Walken shines as Frank Abagnale Sr., adding an honest, bittersweet quality to the movie, and his relationship with his son made for the most moving scenes of the film. Tom Hanks has the perfect dry wit in his role of Carl Hanratty, and his portrayal of the somewhat nerdy, striving foil to Leonardo DiCaprio's smooth character created a lot of comedic moments. And of course, Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing as the lead character, Frank Abagnale Jr., as he is in all of his roles. He really lets us see the humanity of the character and why he was the way he was, as well as does a great job in a more comedic role, different from the dark ones he usually tends to take on. He's the perfect mixture of suave, boyish and troubled that this character needs to be believable, and he pulls it off amazingly.In brief, this movie is something really different and incredibly interesting. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a fascinating, intelligent man with a true story that is both funny and full of real emotion, and these actors and director take it into their hands in the most perfect way. Definitely a must see.",10,2,3,20 March 2010
Romeo + Juliet," A beautiful, unconventional adaptation full of raw emotion
","This is an incredible adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. It's wild and unconventional and ridiculous, and that's what makes it so good. The director, Baz Luhrmann, knows that he's going out of the realm of what most people would consider to be a great screen adaptation of this play, and he uses that to its full advantage. This isn't just Shakespeare for a Shakespeare-reading audience, it's easily accessible and enjoyable whether or not you've read the play or can understand the full meaning behind each line. The direction and scenery is raw and unpretentious; the modern setting means it doesn't distract you with elaborate costumes or historical accuracies, just lets the pure emotion of the story come through. It really brings across the point that this type of story resonates through every time period and every generation, and can mean just as much to a modern audience as it did in Shakespeare's time. The performances in this movie are incredible, much more so than in any other version of this play, stage or screen, that I've ever seen. Harold Perrineau plays infamous entertainer Mercutio with both dramatic flair and emotional intensity, and brings the character to life in a way that I believe Shakespeare himself would have appreciated (whether or not he would agree with the fact that he was dressed as a drag queen at a point in the movie), and John Leguizamo's Tybalt is appropriately fiery and sneering while bringing an interesting humanity to this typically villainous character. The leads also turn out stunning performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were perfectly casted as these star-crossed lovers, and they embody their youth and naivet√© in a way that, for the teenage audience watching this film, makes it feel fresh and personal. They speak Shakespearan dialogue with a raw, unpracticed ease, bringing to mind the way that these young lovers would have really spoken. Leo's Romeo is every bit as perfectly over-the- top and romantic as one might expect, and he handles both sweet, intense and tragic scenes with a realness that tears at your heart. Claire's Juliet has that same quality, and she lends even iconic lines ('Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?') a new twist. All in all, don't judge this movie by its cover. A modern version of Romeo + Juliet featuring gunfights and costume parties might not be for everyone, but it stays so true to the genuine, relatable themes of the play that the backdrop can't possibly impair your enjoyment.",9,0,1,12 March 2010
The Aviator," An incredible film
","This movie was so, so, so good. I saw it for the first time mainly for Leonardo DiCaprio...I'm a fan of his and I'd heard good things about this movie...and I didn't have any idea what to expect, considering I knew next to nothing about Howard Hughes. And it wasn't that I came out of this movie knowing much more, considering that there were historical inaccuracies and Scorsese chose to dramatize certain characters and points in his life and leave others out. But I did come out of it enormously entertained. It's the kind of movie that sticks with you, not making you think or analyze everything but still staying in your mind because it makes a big impact. Every single scene, every single sequence was gorgeously shot, and so much detail was put into imitating each setting and each character. And the writing was great...while the story didn't have a set arc (it's hard to do a really story arc in biopics because real life just isn't like that...) each moment and line is so symbolic of everything the movie is and everything to come. From after the huge crash sequence (a terrifying sequence, as you feel like you're there), when Howard is lying on the ground and chokes out, 'I'm Howard Hughes, the aviator' to the end scene when he thinks back on his childhood future for himself and how it was all coming true, but he couldn't so much enjoy it because of his debilitating mental condition, it was just perfect. I've read so much about how the characters were so 'miscast,' but I couldn't disagree more. Leo is perfect as a pre-downward-spiral Hughes (a strange casting choice, but one that made sense nonetheless, considering his contribution to the picture on a producing standpoint and his real life as an idolized but extremely private celebrity as Howard Hughes was in his glory days) and his acting just got better and better as the film went on. When you end up in the Senate hearings sequence and you see him on screen, he's such a complete dead ringer for Howard Hughes...right down to the things he says, the way he says them, the way he carries himself, his fidgeting, his facial expressions...even his appearance (although not really close to Hughes's at all to begin with) is so accurate. Leo really did his research and gave Hughes his own spin while still getting as close to the actual mannerisms of the man as possible. He gives such a convincing performance I'm surprised that he was able to come out of the character at the end of the day. Cate Blanchett was an amazing choice as Katharine Hepburn, and she really has fun with the role, turning out a great performance that was both accurate and a bit teasing, something that the real life Hepburn probably would have admired. Alan Alda is ridiculously great as Senator Brewster, and Kate Beckinsdale is a believable Ava Gardner. She definitely has a sensual poise about her that is so hard to come by. John C. Reilly is great as Noah Dietrich (his confusion at Howard's behavior yet his sympathy for him was spot on). I didn't really understand the inclusion of Alec Baldwin as Juan Tripp, but he does have that somewhat slimy feel that translates well into that type of a manipulative role. All in all, this movie was great. There are a couple scenes in which people might feel slightly uncomfortable or disturbed, such as the sequence in the screening room, but they're necessary to carry the movie and understand the character and his madness, and they're a great example of DiCaprio's acting talents and the fact that he's fearless in becoming his character. Even if you might go 'ew, what the heck?' during those, this movie isn't so much about being pretty (even though it is) as it is about contrasting the public persona and legend of Howard Hughes with the private one, and it succeeds wonderfully.",9,0,0,16 August 2010
Titanic," Beautiful, fascinating and positively iconic
","This is an INCREDIBLE movie. Every bit of it was beautifully shot, and the accuracies to the look of the actual Titanic were miraculously on point. This movie is, in one word, iconic. Everyone knew the Titanic, and now everyone knows this movie. It is arguably one of the most famous love stories of all time, and although the concept is tired: rich girl meets poor boy, they can't be together, etc., the fact that they are aboard the infamous RMS Titanic is reason enough to consider it different. Every scene is gorgeously picturesque, and makes for some of the most memorable movie moments ever. The actors are also great, and the characters really make this story. Although Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet aren't quite yet at their prime in their most famous movie, they play these characters convincingly and with a lot of heart. You feel for them every step of the way, and DiCaprio and Winslet have a chemistry that simply can't be matched. You can tell how much they care about each other as people, and that translates into a fiercely protective, emotionally powerful romance on screen. Overall, this movie is one of the best out there. Its length (around three hours) may bother some people, but it never feels tedious to watch. James Cameron is an impeccable director that looks to make every detail perfect, and some of the small, seemingly insignificant scenes he added were a few of the most moving of the entire film. Titanic is a passionate, beautiful story of a doomed love that will keep your heart racing and your tears flowing until the very end.",10,5,9,12 March 2010
