Minority Report," The usual Spielber an astonishing, superficial film
","The film is quite superficial. As common in Spielberg. There is no introspection, no question asked on the role of Precrime. Just two or three phrases in the film. Moreover the history is quite different from the original short story (a lot more deeper, and more coherent) and it is not coherent. For example there is NO evidence for not including the agatha precog in X's file. But the most important thing is about the title: in the original story it had a real menaing. In this film, none.",6,0,0,11 October 2002
Independence Day," very bad
","This is the worse film ever made: history is completely stupid and it is mistakes full. Physics and CS laws are completely forgotten. For example, aliens are mainly destructed by means of a computer virus: think at that: they have technology to travel faster than light and they have no antivirus!!!",1,20,38,9 November 2001
