The Equalizer," Denzel at his (usual) best.
",There was a time when Al Pacino was my most favorite actor-no more-Denzel Washington is probably the only actor that can make a lousy movie into a classic. I have yet to see a movie starring DW where he doesn't turn even the creepiest movie into something worth watching. I don't think ANYONE can compare with his abilities in the acting field-thus he is my new favorite and one of the two or three who can make any movie worth watching. It's really not fair to his fellow actors how he takes over the screen with his ability and makes everyone else seem like a hack!,10,0,0,9 February 2020
Catch Me If You Can," You Don't Want To Catch It
",Truly a deplorable film. It was so bad I find it a waste of time to review-It doesn't even deserve a bad review-On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 3(a bit better than a bad porno film-but only by a hair.) A real atrocity!,Null,0,0,29 December 2002
Se7en," Brad Pitt is Mediocre
","I don't know if Brad Pitt is just a so-so actor or if his being in the same movie with Morgan Freeman just makes it appear that way. Freeman is one of my choices for best actor in Hollywood today. Off-screen he appears to be as quiet and dignified as he does on-screen. He is one of the Hollywood actors who, thank God, you never hear spout the political bird-droppings that so many in Hollywood are prone to these days and which have surely diminished Hollywood in so many eyes. The movie was a fine vehicle for Freeman, who seems born to the role of the thinking police detective. I was somewhat turned off by Pitts affected accent in this movie which, by and large, with the exception of a few scenes, held my attention and there were several scenes that were riveting. I don't know why, but the first time I saw this movie I considered it just so-so but on viewing it again I've changed my opinion and now consider it better than average.",Null,1,3,17 June 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Great movie-whatever your politics
","Just saw Million Dollar Baby and thought it was an above average movie and would recommend it to anyone if for no other reason than Morgan Freeman, my favorite actor, is in it. As to the ludicrous comment about Michael Medved, implying he's a closed-minded bigot because he panned the movie, well-not a very open-minded thing to say, was it. There are people in this country who really have to come to terms with the fact that their side lost the election and stop seeing life in blue state-red state dichotomies. How someone's voting habits would affect what they think of a movie, unless it is an undisguised hit piece like Fahrenheit 911, is a little beyond me but I guess there are some people that see political motivations in everything. The election is over-get over it.",Null,1,3,22 January 2005
