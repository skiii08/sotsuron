Minority Report," Ok film, but major plot problems! Rewrite it 5 more times maybe?
","All spoilers:First problem, the title. The Minority Report refers to the occasional differing furtuecast of one of the 3 psychics, but even tho the film is named after this it turns out to be totally inconsequential to the story.Second major flaw is the doctor who gives Tom Cruise his new eyes, even after he reveals that he hates Cruise for putting him in jail. Why did he help him, why didn't he cut his eyes out and leave him there? Made no sense and took up a lot of screen time.Problem three, cruise later uses his old eyes to gain access to the pre-crime building. Wouldn't they have locked out his security, or would it not have alerted them to his presence???The biggest problem is that after all that build up, it turns out to be a lame 'whodunnit' and uses the oldest/lamest hollywood cliche in the book, making the bad guy the one you were supposed to least suspect/the protagonist's best friend/the head of the organisation/etc.Too bad. Seems Lucas and Spielberg are both losing their edge. Especially when they both release movies in the same season that have the hero's jumping through machine factories like the gophers in those old warner bros. cartoons. Did they get together and plan that?Lame.",2,4,7,24 June 2002
Terminator Salvation," Directing alone does not account for this failure.
","The directing on this movie is actually fairly competent from a strictly visual point of view, the second unit directing was also not too bad, but the story had no drive and you didn't give a crap what happened to anyone. The supposed shocker moments were like 'who cares' instead of 'WOW'.Directors with no vision always produce movies like this, they end up trying too hard to please everyone and end up pleasing no one. Its a great example of hack film making, McG learned how to make movies by watching Michael Bay movies, not realizing that that makes him nothing more than a Michael Bay hack, and Michael Bay himself is nothing more than a hack of James Cameron. So we are watching a movie made by a hack of a hack of a good director.Good directors are like any other great artist, they only come along 1 or 2 per generation. So far for this generation the only director that can be possibly included in that list is Nolan.Let me give McG one hint, if your movie is filled with huge explosions from beginning till end, then none of the explosions will stand out in anyones mind, they just all run together. Have no more than 2 or 3 big explosions, have the spaced out so the biggest one is near the end, and have that be FOR some good reason or else no one will care.This movie is just a turd, I'm sure the average movie going public will just ignore it but its a real letdown for fans of Terminator 1/2 who really wanted something a little more after T3.Basically its a really poorly thought out story with one 'gotcha' moment in it that everyone can see coming a mile away. Too many big explosions that you don't care about. An ending that seems a foregone conclusion, and its really way too long.Bad. Avoid.",1,17,36,1 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Pavlov's Dogs You Are, if you liked this.
","In order to understand why people are saying this is 'The best since Empire' over and over again, you have to understand that they are all suffering from Pavlov's Dog syndrome. I had a conversation with some younger guys at work the other day and they actually said the following about Attack of the Clones, and about movies in general. I quote: 'If a movie has a sucky story and bad dialogue, it can totally be saved by great special effects. Good special effects can make any movie great!' At first I was shocked that anyone could make such a statement, then I realized that hollywood is blowing the whistle and these guys are salivating. In this society of style over substance, there is a built in audience for horrible summer movies like Clones, who will ignore everything bad about it just to gett to the 'money shot'. This movie is more like Star Wars Porn than anything else, and if I had a remote control in the theater I would have skipped the chatter and gotten right to the Jedi on Jedi action.As Yoda might have said when he still had a talented screenwriter, 'special effects do Not a great movie make'. In fact having to sit through special effects sequences involving characters you do not care about is tedious, and makes a movie seem even worse. Attack of the Clones is a mish-mash of a film with ripped off sequences from dozens of other movies, from 6th Element to Empire Strikes Back, it has absolutely no story at all, no acting at all, and to top it all off they had to get Amadala's wardrobe from Britney Spears closet.I won't bore you with any details from this film, I'm sure you'll go to see it and be bored by the details in person. But basically there is no emotional center to the movie, and no one for us to relate to or care about. In the original series, that character was Han Solo. They wanted us to care about Luke, but we didn't, we cared about Han because he was cool, and a normal guy. Part of the reason we don't care about anyone in clones is because no one is a normal guy, they are all wizards in robes with mystical powers. Fun to watch maybe, but can you or I really relate to them? Well we asked for an all Jedi movie, and we got it. But no one expected it to be this bad, this boring or this uninteresting.Till we stop rewarding movies like this with no substance, we are likely to get many more just like it.2 of out a potential 100",1,1,4,18 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Yoda does NOT rock, Jar Jar was not the problem with TPM
","If you took Jar Jar completely out of Phantom Menace it would not save the movie, this was tried in the infamous 'Phantom Edit' and what that proved is that even without Jar Jar it was still a deeply flawed movie. Furthermore, if Phantom had been a great movie, I doubt Jar Jar could have ruined it.Sadly Clones is simply Phantom with no Jar Jar, Lucas thought the work he did in Phantom was basically good, so he took out what he thought was the only bad element, Jar Jar, and proceeded to make Clones. Well surprise surprise, taking out Jar Jar did not make up for bad writing, terrible CGI and marginal directing, but I'm sure George still thinks that Jar Jar was his only bad idea in the last 25 years.I'm also completely mystified by the fan reaction to Yoda, they all say it like a mantra, 'Yoda Rocks'. Its like they handed out a pamphlet to the geeks in line telling them what they were supposed to think and say after seeing the movie. Don't these 'Jedi' have any opinions of their own?I think Star Wars fans have now far surpassed 'Trekkies' in terms of being blind to the obvious flaws in their franchise of choice, and I am sure the term 'Jedi' will now go down in history not as a respected religious concept in a great movie trilogy, but rather as a term to describe the geekiest nerds in our culture, a term that is far more derogatory than 'Trekkie' ever was...",1,0,1,27 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," STAR WARS II : DEFENSE FROM THE CHEESY CGI ROBOTS AGAIN, via CLONES - better title
","Why is this movie called 'Attack of the Clones'? Wouldn't that imply that the Clones are attacking the good guys? In Empire strikes back, the Empire 'struck back' at the rebels, the name of the film fit what went on in the movie. However there is no 'Attack of the Clones' in this movie, once again its Attack of the completely useless robots just like in Phantom Menace. The Clones are used only to defend the good guys against the attack of the robots, a far more apt title for this movie would have been 'STAR WARS II : DEFENSE FROM THE CHEESY CGI ROBOTS AGAIN, via CLONES' And hey, that's even a better title than the stinky one it has now.If you are still reading and want to know why it sucks, the problem is CGI.
CGI is in its infancy, maybe in 20 years CGI will be a tried and true method of making special effects but right now its very hit and miss. When they made Empire, the techniques they used were all 70 years old, they had mastered them, thats why its such a great film! Now they have abandoned all the established methods for CGI which is barely 10 YEARS OLD. Thats why it sucks, because the art of CGI is not there yet, and likely will not be there for 20 more years. There are no Old Masters of the CGI art form because everyone who does CGI is 14 years old, and their 'art' reflects their maturity.If they really want to make a good Star Wars next time, go back to the tried and true methods. Use CGI to enhance the real footage maybe, but do not go all CGI again please!!!!!!!Stay far far away from this failed experiment in film making, especially if you are over 30 and might have at one time been a fan.",1,0,1,22 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," First SW Box office Bomb?
","Syncophantic Star Wars fans did their best to pump up the 'buzz' on this film before anyone else had a chance to see it, based on the fact that it is a little better than Phantom Menace, <except the lightsaber dual which was actually far superior in Phantom.> They were hoping to trick us into all thinking this was the movie we had been waiting for all these years. Well they failed.I think after a few non-jedi's see this movie, the word will get out thats its bad, Really bad, Awful in fact. It might actually be Worse than Phantom in a lot of ways, which is something that the fanboys could never accept. When those real people get out there and tell other real people to stay away, then this movie might go down in history as the first actual Star Wars box office bomb. I think Spiderman will beat it for biggest film of the year, and I think it may drop from the number one spot faster than Menace did, i.e. 3 weeks. And to all you fanboys out there who tried so hard to trick us and to get our hopes up, well it backfired. You got my hopes up for a movie that had I gone in with low expectations, I might have enjoyed a little. You had us thinking it was the second comming or something! Way to go guys, it really backfired, and now Clones will go down in history as a box office bomb.",1,0,1,20 May 2002
Fargo," Your IQ must be this high to watch...
","I cannot believe that people rented Fargo because it was a black comedy and expected Jim Carrey type laughs from it. If you look up the definition of black comedy, you'll see that its not supposed to be 'ha ha' funny.Its a cutting study of human nature, showing that people will get greedy for no reason and, kill others with only the slightest provocation. And it happened!!!!!!!!   !!    !!!!!!The reason Fargo is a great movie, (maybe the best film of the 90's) is BECAUSE its based on a true story!! If you went into it not knowing that fact or not caring, then it would not mean much to you after you saw it. I'll admit that if it were not a true story, it would be a very uninteresting movie. But it IS, and thats the essence of it.I had a friend tell me that he had no problem solving the mystery long before then end. 'IT WASN'T A WHO-DUNIT MOVIE!!' I screamed at him. He obviously missed the entire point of the film, and so did a lot of the other people who commented on it here.If you watch a lot of Temptation Island, Dawson's Creek or re-runs of Dukes of Hazzard, then think twice before you rent Fargo. I promise it will not make any more sense to you than reading a physics manual.8)",10,0,0,3 February 2001
Watchmen," Never intended for mass audience consumption
","I think one of the most beautiful ironies in recent memory is how the Psychologist in Watchmen was driven insane by digging into Rorscarch's psyche, just as normal American families were driven insane because they went to Watchmen with their kids not knowing they were entering the mind of Alan Moore. Thats something that most people are not ready for/never will be ready for, and its the biggest reason a Watchmen movie could never work as a mass audience film especially when literally interpreted from the source. Alan Moore goes to dark places when he writes, he asks tough questions, and his writing is both shocking and disturbing on many levels, and it contains a whole lotta truth. If there is one thing the average person cannot handle and does not want ANY part of, its the truth, in any form, and especially not in their 'entertainment'.There was no way Watchmen could ever be 'dumbed down' enough for it to appeal to a wide audience, thats not was it was ever intended to do. This movie is true to the book on some levels, it has truth, its dark and its disturbing. So why did Hollywood try and market it as just another super hero movie like the Dark Knight, as if to say it might be something you could take your kids to see? I have no idea, it is probably the biggest movie marketing blunder I have seen in a long time.This movie fails because it does not capture the essence of the characters, the only one it gets close to doing so with is Rorschach, (and you just know that Hollywood execs are right now trying to figure out a way to make a Rorschach prequel movie, PG rated of course.) But so little time is spent on character development for the rest of the characters that they come off as flat as a cardboard cutouts.I'm not saying the movie is a disaster, but it doesn't do what the book did in terms of the way it made you think and feel, and isn't that the point? If they could not translate that to film, then the other alternative should have been considered which was to make the Watchmen into an ordinary superhero team and give them an adventure to go on like the Avengers or Justice League. Quite frankly, much as that would have been a bastardization of the source material, it would have been more entertaining than what we ended up with.All the slo-mo action in the world could not smooth over the problems associated with a 'book to film' project like this, but I'm sure thats how Zack Snyder and co sold the idea to the big wigs. Only someone as young and inexperienced as Snyder could have the ego to think that making a movie like this and have it appeal to a wide audience was a realistic goal. I suspect he will be far more careful and 'Michael Bay' like in choosing his projects in the future.",3,14,26,18 March 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Inexperienced film makers + unlimited budget = this mess
","In a future where they have robot battle Armour, how has the concept of the recoilless rifle totally escaped them? The machine guns mounted on the battle armour would be totally useless as it would be impossible to aim any weapon with that much recoil. Plus it looked really dumb.This movie is a total mess. There is no drama, no subtlety, nothing inventive or original. (who hasn't seen the mass of robot armies fighting each other in every video game trailer and rock video over the past few years?) The movie only gets interesting whenever Smith walks on, but he is so much more interesting than anything else going on that its distracting more than entertaining.And is it me or was it impossible to follow what was going on? There was so much going on in the battle scenes and there was so much fast camera movement that it was completely impossible to focus on anything, much less tell what was happening. I occasionally had a vague notion that a 'squid' had been shot and was exploding, but I was not able to clearly seen any of the action, at all. Compare this to a great movie like Empire Strikes Back where there is a lot going on in the asteroid chase scene, but at no point do you question whether that was in fact a Tie Fighter hitting an asteroid, or if the Millennium Falcon was flying around in an asteroid field. Its all completely clear, and not so mind numbingly fast that you cannot begin to digest what you have seen.Anyway, this is just awful, I cannot think of any reason I would ever watch this movie again.",2,1,1,9 November 2003
Pitch Black," Hollywood - Get over Aliens, Please!
","Pitch Black - Hollywood, Get Over Aliens Already!Aliens was a great movie, probably the best sequel ever and on its own one of the best action movies ever made. Having said that, I think its time that Hollywood moves on and gets over it. There will never be another movie in this genre that is as good as Aliens, so any derivative of Aliens is a pointless waste of time and money. I'd rather watch a good movie again than see a bad remake of that movie, so the next time a film like Pitch Black comes along I'll simply pull out my dusty copy of Aliens and save myself the 8 bucks.This is more a criticism of Hollywood than anything else, I'm sure it must be hard to come up with a premise that involves aliens on a distant planet that does not in some way pay homage to a movie like Aliens or Alien. For me it was hard not to draw parallels between this film and the movies I grew up with, and it was impossible for me to see it as an original plot concept. Do the aliens in these shows ever do anything besides eat people? I mean, is that their sole function in life? Lets think of something more interesting for the monsters to do in the next Aliens rip-off. Maybe the aliens aren't hungry at all, or if they are hungry, maybe all they eat is people's shoes and socks. Now we're getting somewhere.The premise.Humans in the future without enough navigational sense to stay clear of solar systems when traveling at near light speed, crash on an unnamed, unknown planet in a strange solar system that for some bizarre reason has 3 suns. I don't know why the producers went with 3 suns as opposed to 2 suns, especially considering the fact that most solar systems are in fact binary, except to maybe make the little ones in the audience say 'Aw cool, 3 suns!' The survivors, who are not very bright to begin with, are then presented with the extra little problem of having an escaped murder loose amongst them. His name is Riddick and for the first ½ hour of the movie they look around for him instead of looking for food or water! Lets get our priorities straight shall we? First thing you do after crashing on an alien planet is look for food we all know that, then you see how much Diet Dr. Pepper survived the crash of course, then you look for the escaped murders.. Sheesh. Where did these people learn to forage?Let the clichés begin!Of course the planet is totally dead with no water and no apparent life or ecosystem, and yet low and behold there is a breathable atmosphere! What a shock. Also with 3 suns it's only just a little hotter than Earth in summer, how convenient! I'd think that 3 suns might make for some interesting plot twists about the crew fighting over the shady spot, but sadly nothing that interesting occurs in the film. At one point the survivors come across a vast field of bones, presumably from the herds of animals that once roamed this planet with 3 suns and no water. Exactly how vast herds of giant herbivores would evolve in a desert is not as interesting to the crew as how the skeletons are all lined up, as if they died at the same time standing up. Foreshadowing, what a concept! The high school English teacher of the movies writer must be so proud. Later on we find out that there is a whole species of underground carnivores who are just waiting for the lights to go out so they can feast upon the multitude of juicy humans who crash land on their nasty little planet every so often. Oh yes, I can see how 6 or 7 dehydrated humans every few years could sustain a huge group of meat eating, shade loving monsters for years to come. Humans would have to be pretty filling for that to be true, especially when you consider that these voracious creatures have seemingly eaten all other life on the planet. Wouldn't they have eaten themselves into extinction? Apparently not. The monsters are also afraid of light, or are harmed by it or something, the bottom line is they just don't like light ok? So our humans are safe as long as there is a lot of light, and in a 3-sun solar system that doesn't seem to be a problem.But luckily for us the crash happens just hours before a once-every-22-year eclipse that the beasties have been waiting for so they can get out of their shady holes and eat all the starving, dehydrated, hapless, defenseless humans that have crash landed on their dusty little planet. This eclipse does not cover just one sun, or even 2 suns. Astoundingly it covers a remarkable 3 suns, go figure. That coincidence is not as great as them crashing only a few yards from an abandoned mining camp, where they learn all about the impending eclipse from a home made model of the solar system made by the previous owners of the camp. The miners were also in the process of leaving the camp in a spaceship they had, but didn't quite make it. These people had a spaceship, A Spaceship! And they had to build a little mock solar system out of foam balls and coat hangers? Isn't this supposed to be the future, couldn't they have figured out the alignment of the planets from the computer on their.. Spaceship??? Did I mention they had a spaceship? If I had a spaceship I don't think I'd go be a miner on some weird planet with no water and lots of monsters. I'd keep looking till I found a planet with lots of water, and no monsters. Then I'd relax and get a job making web pages, or their future equivalent. This is supposed to be the future right?So the crew is then eaten one by one in various gory but uninteresting ways, and since the characters are so profoundly un-heroic and uninteresting, we really don't care. In fact we want them to get eaten so we can see the creatures do their thing some more. At one point you start rooting for the monsters so you can hear the gory body breaking noises.Here comes another criticism of Hollywood, can't they think of something more frightening than being eaten? People just aren't as scared of being chewed on as they were back in the 70's when Jaws came out, and they have been getting gradually less and less terrified of it for the last 30 years. I personally am not very worried about being swallowed whole or ripped apart by a huge beast in my every day life. Maybe if I was a Lion tamer or a Crocodile wrangler this movie might scare the pants off me! But as I am a graphic designer by trade I'd be much more scared of a movie about computers that come to life and start making artistic designs on their own, putting me out of work. Well its more likely than anything that happens in Pitch Black.How could this movie have been made better?I'm glad you asked. Well for starter lets stop making the bad guy in movies look like a wrestler. I know wrestling is very popular right now and all that, but in reality no one looks like these people. And people who look like the bad guy in this movie are generally speaking not very tough, they just work out with weights a lot. The toughest people I have even seen are bikers, and if you have seen what they look like you know they don't spend too much time in a gym. Or conversely you could make him look like a totally normal person, that way when he does turn out to be an exceptionally talented murder the audience would be forced to say, 'Gee, he looks like a totally normal person. How could he be such an exceptionally talented murderer?'Too much foreshadowing!They spent so much time at the beginning of the movie trying to make the planet look scary that by the time the scary stuff happened, it wasn't a surprise. It would have been better if there were hints of something bad that had happened in the past, but making it obvious that something bad had occurred made it very anti-climactic when it all came down. I would have liked to see the ecosystem in some state of recovery from the last time there was an eclipse. That would have given the nasty critters something else to do besides harass our hapless crash victims, they could have chased around the other animals and wreaked a little havoc on the environment rather than just play chase the humans. That might have made the creatures seem more real rather than just 2 dimensional hapless human harassers. Also, I think the creatures should have been in hibernation waiting for the next eclipse, rather than skittering around in the tunnels. How would they findenough food between eclipses with all the animals that did live on the surface being dead and all?Live humans are more interesting than dead ones.For example the people from the mining camp would have been more interesting if they were alive, like walking around and doing stuff. Maybe they would have seen the crash and gone out to rescue any survivors, now that sounds like something live humans would do. This would have been better than the cliché of 'we crash landed only feet or inches from a settlement, lucky us.'We crash-landed, we have no way home.sob, sob.This is such a tired premise, especially when 30 minutes into the film they do find a way to get home and it becomes a plot device. (i.e. we have to drag the power cells from the crashed ship to the new ship, etc. etc. etc.) Come on! Make it a scientific mission that's there to study the eclipse or something, that would have defused the cliché of 'Hey cool, we arrived here just in the nick of time to witness a once in a thousand year cosmic event'.How are the Special Effects?I have no idea, I couldn't see them. Basically the plot revolves around the fact that these nasty critters only come out when its pitch black... need I say more? Literally there is not one shot of a full monster in the light, so all you ever see is them in silhouette.In closing I'll just say this, its not a scary or entertaining movie but if you can get into a matinee for $3.00 I say go for it. You'll have fun at least trying to comprehend how anyone as stupid as the people in this movie ever learned how to fly spaceships in the first place.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," TX not ominous
","The deck is stacked a little too much in Arnolds favor in this movie, by that I mean he kicks a little too much butt. In T2 the T1000 is clearly superior to Arnold and the hero's spend most of the movie running from it, rightly so, and Arnold gets his nads handed to him every time they meet.
However in this movie Arnold should be even more inferior to the TX, but he is constantly on the offensive, attacking her aggressively and beating her without too much trouble on every occasion. I never felt like Arnold was in any peril at the hands of the TX, all she seemed able to do was hit him with cars and ram his head into walls.Bottom line, the T1000 in T2 was a million times more dangerous, the TX is just another lame robot.",3,0,0,24 July 2003
X-Men: The Last Stand," Sucked the life out of me and the franchise
","Too say that this movie sucked the life out of me is a huge understatement.I can see why Patrick Stuart showed up for one more paycheck, but he was wise to get the heck out when it was obvious that the creative team responsible for the success of the first two movies had headed for the door.Same I think for the actors who played nightcrawler, cyclops and Mystique, my guess is that they signed on long in advance of Singer's departure, and once the paycheck cleared they did care how much or little screen time they got. I suspect anyone who did not like the new direction the film took after Singer left was simply killed off, or cut from the final edit.And Phoenix with no flames? Even singer had a hint of flames coming up from the lake at the end of X2. It would have been wonderful to see Phoenix flying through space in the form of a bird, a vision I remember clearly from the comics I read as a child. I'm sure Singer would have done at least that part right. In this movie she comes off as a greasy undead with no dialogue. Man what a huge waste of what could have been a great movie moment, gone now forever.I have a feeling this movie will have a huge tumble in its second week in the range of 70%, that might send the single thats needed here.I am giving it a 0 out of 10, wish I could go back in time and forget I ever saw it.",1,1,3,31 May 2006
Titanic," Hype? Yeah, I went to McDonalds and got the McTitanic meal.
","I just cannot stand it anymore, all the people who hated this movie mention the 'hype' as their reason. Lets look at the facts;A> There were no commercial tie-ins with any other popular businesses, like Walmart or McDonalds, which is standard for a hollywood blockbuster these days. Look at Star Warts: Phantom Menace, I was actually able to get JarJar Binks bum wipe, Literally. Thats Hype, and it all took place before the movie came out. All the Hype for Titanic happened AFTER the film was released and it came from people who had seen it and loved it.B> There was no money left over at the end of production for a huge ad campaign, this is a fact. They almost lost out the first weekend to a James Bond film because of this, James Cameron and some of the other producers had to hit the talk show circuit in hopes of avoiding a total massacre at the box office.C> The stars gave him no help, Leonardo was so sure that the movie was going to bomb that he did no public appearances before the movie came out, he only hit the talk shows in about week 3 or 4 of the films release. No one had faith in this movie, not the stars, not the Studio heads, no one but James Cameron himself and he was willing to put his entire future as a film maker on the line by giving back his salary.All the guys who hate titanic that I have spoken to are just jealous of Leonardo. They say 'the movie just made money cuz girls love him', well if that were true then 'The Beach' would be the second biggest film of all time wouldn't it?I don't think Loenardo is a great actor, and I personally believe Titanic will ruin is career because he'll never top it and he is so sure that he is the reason it was a success. But its a great movie overall, and its not stardard hollywood fluff aimed at high school kids like American Pie, or teen-aged sex farce #2263455283 as I like to call it. Next week another one will come out just like it, add a 1 to the end of the number don't bother to name it. But a movie like Titanic comes along once in a lifetime like Gone with the Wind.Lobo69",10,1,3,14 May 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Talk, talk, talk... Fight, fight, fight!
","Ok it's a good movie, very high concept, and of course it had to be to compete with the original. However this movie underlines the fact that it's very hard to top yourself when you set the bar so high in the first place. It's a little ironic that the very guys who set the new standard for action/sci-fi movies are themselves now victims of that very standard.First I'll address some of the concerns I have read in other peoples reviews, then I'll add a few concerns of my own;The big one people seem to have a hard time with is the dancing scene near the beginning of the movie. It seems that most Matrix viewers are comfortable with narrative symbolism but are completely unable to comprehend visual symbolism. The dance scene is symbolic of why humans will always triumph over the machines, it's because we have that joy, that 'rubbing up against each other' that machines don't have and never can have. The dance scene was a symbolic reference to the human spirit, but I guess that concept is a bit subtle considering most of the audience was waiting for buildings to blow up.So I have no problem with that scene, it made perfect sense to me and humanized the movie a little.The other scene people either loved or hated was the Neo vs. 100 Smiths. I have a problem with that scene too but not the problem most other people had with it. My problem is that in the first Matrix, he was able to destroy agents by flying into them and 'absorbing' them or whatever. Why then in this movie does he just keep fruitlessly hitting them over and over with no real results? I can tell you exactly why, because the film makers thought it would look cool to have Neo fighting 100 Smiths, and they decided style was more important than continuity or coming up with a better idea.A better scene would have had Neo destroy all the smiths rather than having hit continually hit them over and over with increasingly big sticks, and then finally retreating. The final scene would have been Neo surrounded by dead Smiths, and would have been cooler than him running away.My second problem with that scene is connected to another fight Neo has a little later after they free the keymaker, Neo has to fight 6 guys who don't seems to be anywhere near as powerful as Smith is. Even though he has only 6 guys to fight instead of 100, it takes him forever to kill them. Why was he able to beat off 100 Smiths without too much trouble, but these 6 guys kept him busy for what seemed like an hour?A better scene would have been for Neo to beat them incredibly fast, solidifying the concept that he is the most powerful thing in the Matrix. This scene diminished his perceived power greatly and for no good reason.I do sympathize with the writers of this movie, they made Neo a little too powerful at the end of the first Matrix, thus leaving themselves little room to move with the character in this movie. Evidence of that can be seen in the tricks they used to keep Neo out of scenes where he simply would have been to powerful, like when he found himself suddenly 500 miles from the battle that was happening on the freeway.These writing tactics are similar to what they have done for years in the Justice League comics, its hard to present any threat to a team where Superman is more powerful than all the other hero's in the group put together. The writers often resort to temporarily de-powering Superman or they conveniently get him out of the way for a while so the other characters have something to do till he can get back to save the day. Both of these things happened to Neo in Matrix Reloaded. The de-powered version of Neo shows up at the end where he destroys 3 squids outside the Matrix. He is so powerful inside the Matrix that I suspect the next movie will happen mostly outside the Matrix where Neo still has some power, but nowhere near as much.I really liked the symbiotic relationship between the machines and Zion. They created a flawed program to fit flawed humans. The flaws in the program always leads to some people escaping and forming a city, and eventually leads to an anomaly like Neo who signals to the machines when the cycle is ending and its time to destroy Zion and start again. It's an elegant solution to the flaw built into the system they made. But it's an ironic plot twist that I think most people missed, again maybe in a movie that is so visually stupefying, narrative subtlety is lost on the viewers.The fact that Neo chose not to continue the cycle is interesting, but again I think that was lost on most of the viewers who were waiting for the next visual feast. Just like the Oracle kept telling him, its about choices, his choice was to continue the cycle or risk everyone's life on a gamble.I guess this movie is an example of how you cannot have your cake and eat it too, when you have that much eye candy on the screen it becomes impossible to get any kind of deeper meaning across to the viewer. I think the impact of the story would have been more dramatic if the visuals had been toned down just a little. But the film makers had themselves boxed into a corner, they simply had to do both. Make it a bigger story and bigger special effects as well. I think they would have been better off topping one or the other, but not both.No rating, it's a good movie, just not an easy one to watch, like staring into the sun too long. I was relieved I did not have to suffer anymore visual dynamite at the end of the movie.",6,0,0,20 May 2003
Iron Man," 200 years from now, maybe...
","I wish they could have found a way to make the Iron Man technology fall a little more in the realm of realism, but instead they took the 'transformers' route and made the technology from 200 to 300 years in the future, literally. Some will say, 'yeah but its a movie, so who cares?' and to a certain extent I agree, but in this particular case the technology is so far from what is possible now, that the whole movie made no sense because it was presented as if it was happening in the modern day. This lack of realism affected the whole movie to the extent that when I walked out, I felt like I had seen a film about cavemen building F1 race cars and putting on their own Indy 500. It was that insane.At least in 'Batman Begins' the technology was only off by 10-20 years, and it was set in an alternate universe where the exact date was never set, so I was able to suspend disbelief for 2 hours with no problem.The lack of realism is further hindered by the obvious fact that they never built the suit, it was 100% digital from start to finish. This is lame in the same way that not making a single storm trooper suit for the last 3 star wars movies was lame. Lame! I hope Iron Man is the last big movie in the super hero genre because I for one am completely sick to death of getting the two hour origin story of every new hero thats introduced on film. Can you imagine the 2 hour origin of Thor or Namor? Somebody kill me before these movies are made...Robert Downey was Tony Stark, I'll give him that, best part of the movie.",4,9,21,11 May 2008
Sin City," Not even 2 dimensional characters.
","The characters are so flat in this movie that they are beyond 2 dimensional, more like 1 dimensional if thats even possible.I left this 'movie' feeling like I had read a comic book for 2 hours, or rather that I had watched a movie of someone reading a comic book to me, and not a very good comic book either.There is also a very sick scene of an 18 year old girl kissing a 70 year old man passionately just because he saved her from a rape 10 years previous. Why would anyone want to see children necking with the elderly??? I'm confused as to why thats entertaining.Avoid this film at all costs, super bad and super boring.-Lobo",1,7,15,28 April 2005
