The Blair Witch Project," A fair movie that is getting way too much hype!
","It's funny how things get out of hand when an underground movie hits mainstream.  I had people tell me (When the movie was only showing in art houses) that the movie was a real incident that happened a few years ago. I can't believe how gullible people are when they read about information on the internet...I mean, if this was truly a real movie spliced together from actual footage of a murder, wouldn't this tape belong to the F.B.I? Maybe this is why I can't fathom the popularity of this movie.  It is not that original. And to tell you the truth, IT'S NOT scary.  Get it together people!!!  It's a low budget piece of 'yawn' (that a few people what you to believe).",Null,0,0,9 August 1999
