Black Swan," Big Wow
","Watched this film last night after a bit of a debate with myself about the ballet aspect of the film, as I'm not a big fan of ballet. However I have to say, that aspect of the film is actually a very nice backdrop to this story. I guess ballet in the real world would require a lot of mental energy, so straight away the film has a believable quality about it. Top that with incredible acting, you're cooking up a great film already. The obvious stand out star of this film is Portman. I think her dedication to this role is unprecedented. She looks unhealthily thin and looks like a typical ballerina from New York (I guess). Then there's the dancing itself, which also (as a non-expert) looks very believable. I can only imagine the amount of hours she put into training for this role.However the stand out stuff for me was her evil stuff. The stuff she sees in the mirror is pretty scary. She pulls it off and it contrasts her timid white swan side brilliantly. I can see movie directors wanting her to play bad girls at a future date. This is her best acting recorded so far. The actual film itself to me at least, reminded me of a few other films such as Eyes Wide Shut and Vanilla Sky. Eyes Wide Shut for the arrangement and Vanilla Sky for it's twisted movements. Doesn't sound too logical but like I say, it's what sprung to my mind personally after watching it.I think if Cubrick could've directed this, I don't think it would have been that different. So that is my compliment to the director. An outstanding piece of cinematography.",10,0,3,21 January 2011
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Point of No Return
","2 years of anticipation for one of the worst wild goose chases in cinema history.
The burning and seemingly important questions raised in TFA, thrown off the edge of a cliff like some history enriched relic light saber.
The so-called mysteries of TFA that saved the day in a re-hashed storytelling of another new hope, all gone to an unsatisfying conclusive graveyard.Killing Snoke so early on though for me was the biggest flaw of the film. Good against evil films are nothing without a rock solid villain, preferably one that lives to near the end of the film.Kylo Ren is still a clueless kid and needs more time to develop into the new supreme leader of the first order and with Snoke dead so early on is a bit like Anikin taking over from Sideous at the end of Revenge of the Sith. With so many key characters gone in this movie, it left me feeling lost.
I think it has left the franchise lost too. I bet George Lucus is thinking, 'See, I told you the prequels weren't that bad.
E9, whatever it is going to be called, has to perform a miracle in order to save SW from extinction.So many people are hating TLJ, myself included. I came away from watching it, not caring what happens next. People have invested time and energy in the anticipation of this saga and RJ has let us down on a biblical scale.There were a few enjoyable scenes in this movie but they were completely overshadowed by a lack of care in the story line. The questions we had after watching TFA just ridiculed as 'not important anymore'.
GL shouldn't have sold out to Disney. TLJ has done more damage than any previous SW film ever did. Yep, it should've permanently stopped at Return of the Jedi.",2,1,1,18 December 2017
The Social Network," Need to be in the right mood to watch
","Well just finished watching this film and didn't really click with it that well. It could have been a lot more fascinating than it was. The casting was good (but not great), the scripting was, as you would expect with mentions of web programming terminology, server hardware and general geeky use of language, but I guess I just wasn't in the right mood for it. It only really picked up when Timberlake's character steps in. The comedy aspect of the film was pretty average and the lead character did come across as a little too 2 dimensional for my liking. All in all not in my top 5 or top 10. It won't make me want to watch a film about the founders of twitter or my space, if anyone writes a script for them too. But in fairness, it wasn't the worst film I've ever seen. It just didn't keep me that interested. Maybe it's a grower.",6,0,1,7 February 2011
