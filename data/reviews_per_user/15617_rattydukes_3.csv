Catch Me If You Can," son of sam laws?
","So i am wondering why no son of sam laws apply to Frank Abagnale Jr. I might not understand how the specifics of the laws work (or if since these crimes were committed before the son of sam laws were in place it doesnt apply), but i would be interested in knowing more if anyone out there is a lawyer....",Null,1,1,5 January 2003
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Powerful and unique
","Spielberg's powerful and remarkable film about a boy and his unusual befriendment of an extra terrestrial. Possibly his finest film, E.T. captures a piece of childhood, and reminds the rest of us of a time long since past. It excites a story adults often forget, and a powerful remembrance of a childhood friendship during difficult periods of development. Adult criticism of the movie loses its youthful bond, and fails to appreciate growing up in the 80's. This is the pinnacle of Spielberg's childhood movies. Few other films capture as powerful a message of childhood emotion. Other films which attempt to do so dive so deep into childhood memories they lose their connection with adults, and degrade to brief interludes of 'dumb' comic relief to keep grown ups from falling asleep. The closest runner up is likely Goonies (a film written by Spielberg). A very personal film for Spielberg; as he explores atypical friendships after the separation of his father; he should be commended for achieving such a remarkable success and for sharing it with the rest of us. I was five when I first saw the movie, and although it frightened me at the time, it still makes me cry. An unparalleled film in its class, it is easy to see why it remains the fourth all time grossing film (adjusted for inflation, third otherwise) seventeen years after its release. Cheers to Spielberg for not ruining the movie by attempting a sequel.",9,66,93,16 June 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," One of the best satires ever made.
","A remarkably witty satire that will try and push you away with its harsh language; don't let it. If you stay with this film you will discover a shrewd and honest critique of movie mania USA and the MPAA. A little patience with this movie (or a lot as the need may be) meets you at the end with a clever pay-off. This was the funniest movie of the summer and one of the best satires I've seen in years. If you're not afraid to re-examine the system do not miss this film; and even if you are see it anyways, just don't judge the movie because it is full of profanity.",9,0,0,26 September 1999
