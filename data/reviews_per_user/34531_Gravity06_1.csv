E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Thoughts about the removal of guns from the film
","I think Steven Spielberg made a mistake in removing the guns from the re-issue of the film; I thought the gun-laden original version was more true-to-life.  The hard reality is that man has a tendency to destroy that which he does not understand; the agents' carrying of weapons in the original print reflected that fact very well.As much we would prefer it otherwise, the world as it exists today is not a friendly place.  In my opinion, the agents' behavior should reflect that fact.",Null,0,0,25 March 2002
