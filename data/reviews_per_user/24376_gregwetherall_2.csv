Skyfall," Hmmm....
","Around the time of Casino Royale, the 2006 instalment of the James Bond series, there was not a great deal of expectation. Internet chatrooms and comment sites were filled with antagonistic references to the casting of Daniel Craig as Bond. It was an act of heresy to cast a blond Bond. It was heinous to have someone who was not overtly suave and sophisticated. The naysayers were plentiful. The aftermath of the Casino Royale release was that not only was Craig a fantastic Bond, he was quite possibly Bond's saviour. He had made the series hip again, when it appeared to be outdated and outmoded, a nostalgic nod to days of old.After Casino Royale's runaway success – widespread critical acclaim and huge box office receipts (the golden ticket for any movie), came the first bump in the road in the form of the flawed and confused follow-up, Quantum of Solace. For a time, it looked as though QoS would be the full stop, rather than a comma, in the story of the British Agent. MGM pulled the plug on funding in light of the international monetary crisis and their own subsequent slide into bankruptcy. What a pity for this great institution to bow out on a whimper. In the years that followed, the faithful trumpeted up a lot of support and the cries for a further film grew.Thankfully, Sony stepped in and enabled production and distribution for this particular offing (and this is abundantly clear from the neat product placement in the feature itself).To outline the plot of a Bond film is not really essential to the review of the content. All Bond films are at once exactly the same, yet also different from each other. It is the routine and checklist of the format that forms part of its appeal. Accordingly, all the Bond tropes are adhered to in Skyfall. Suitably bombastic and dramatic theme song? Check. Gadgets (or lack of) dispensed by Q? Check. Opening scene chase sequence? Check. Memorable baddie? Check. The list could go on. What is important is that Sam Mendes has taken control with a healthy respect for the films preceding Skyfall, and also an enthusiasm to deliver his own stamp on the franchise.This is Craig's third outing, and his presence is by this point familiar and comfortable. There is no shock in his brand of delivery. There is no updating required. There is a need, however, to reinstate the standing of the films after the aforementioned disappointing predecessor. The films opens with a strong hand; a suitably ambitious cross-city chase that incorporates cars, bikes and trains, before providing a heart-in-mouth moment that fires up the adrenaline and provides appropriate reminder, if needed, that we are in James Bond territory. Soon, Adele's theme song plays and the credits roll. The song itself is a welcome return to the grandeur of the theme songs of old, with a Spy Who Loved Me, 'Nobody Does It Better', and Goldfinger sense of import. Rather than being a periphery character, this version pulls in more substance for M, who becomes a major player. Forever reliable, Dame Judy Dench imparts necessary quintessential English reserve to the part. Javier Bardem, who enters proceedings at around the mid-point, is a revelation. One of the saddest aspects of the film is the fact that not more is made of the interplay and verbal interaction between him and Bond. With more emphasis on the psychological swordplay between the two, this could have been an outstanding film. As things stand, he is wily, assured, cunning and cool, marking a volatile cocktail of disenchantment and frustration.This is a solid action film, and one that will arrive with a lot of good will resting on its shoulders. People like the series and want this to do well. Does it succeed? The inclusion of the basic elements of fire, ice and water lead to a full house of dangerous tricks, but some parts work better than others. The penultimate showdown falls a little flat, despite pyrotechnics flaring up in a supernova of light and smoke. The story is not really substantial or absorbing, despite a more than generous running time. Does this matter? It will depend on your own inclinations.In short, this is another Bond film much like all the other Bond films, and yet also its own work Well, you probably knew that already. If you are fond of the antics and escapades of 007, then you will find much to enjoy and revel in here. If not, then this will not necessarily convert you. Business as usual then.for more: toomuchnoiseblog.com and www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-wetherall",6,5,12,31 October 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," The gang is back for another cross-continental jaunt in a surprisingly effective (and very funny) entry for the series.
","Arriving in 2005, in a period when Pixar's dominance looked all-encompassing, Dreamworks dispensed a challenge to the throne with Madagascar. Success did not look likely when it came accompanied with middling-to-poor reviews, which accused it of being one-dimensional and clichéd, despite some humorous characters and a strong voice cast. It suffered critically because it lacked the multi-layered intricacies and groundbreaking animation of Pixar's finest works (of the time period). Such films as, The Incredibles (2004), Finding Nemo (2003) and Toy Story (1995-). Consequently, it was easy to disregard the worth of this more traditional escapist fare. The audiences spoke in droves, however, with the original feature becoming extremely successful and spawning a disappointing sequel in 2008, entitled, Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa.Off the back of this mixed history comes this third instalment. The now-familiar troupe of misfits and comrades are still plotting a return to their native home of New York, only this time, they opt for a route across Europe. This will culminate in brushes with the French authorities and a frosty reception with a travelling circus with chaotic results. The starry voice cast all return, as Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith and Sacha Baron Cohen lend their voices to Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria and Julien, respectively.It is easy for snobbery to creep in when assessing films, and to become haughtily unimpressed by simple satisfaction and crowd-pleasing gestures by film makers. This is highly unfair and unreasonable. For instance, does this film put a smile on the viewer's face? Yes. Is it funny? Extremely. Does it out-stay its welcome? Not really – it wraps up in a neat hour and a half. All of these factors reflect positively on this addition to the Madagascar chain. In fact, it is the strongest of the three films so far. It is a rip-roaring ride that not only packs in a fast-moving plot, but also contains plenty of animation ingenuity. It looks as though this film has been lovingly crafted. As expected, there are bright colours, lots of noises, and strong gags. Julien is back with his funniest lines since the first film and the introduction of new characters replenish the lifeblood of all involved.This does come at the expense of Melman and Gloria, however, who are sidelined slightly in this particular outing. Although fans may be disappointed with this outcome, it is most likely the result of honing the script down to bare essentials and trimming any excess that might enable all to get a fair airing, but to the detriment of telling the tale. Also, criticism could be levelled at a few of the plot excursions which have been seen before elsewhere. For example, there is a strand involving a moody and aggressive Russian circus tiger, Vitaly, who has a similar story trajectory and development as that of Paul Newman's Doc Hudson in Cars (2006).Such nit-picking as that above is pointless and unhelpful in the end. What matters is the expert execution and the feeling that this feature generates. Simply, it as enjoyable an animation that has been released all year and well worth the price of a cinema ticket.for more film reviews: toomuchnoiseblog.com and www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-wetherall",7,1,2,31 October 2012
