The New World," The piece of a true artist
","I remember the vivid discussion that took place back in 1998, when Spielberg came out with the shocking 'Saving Private Ryan' and Malick showed up again on the film-making surface after an odd 20 years by making 'The Thin Red Line'. What you have to understand is that, exclaiming the heated conversations eight years ago, there is a fundamental difference in the philosophy of making movies for the two.Whereas Spielberg is all about excitement and action, Malick is filmed poetry. Dialogue is limited to a certain extent. All that counts is the visual impression and the feelings it leaves you with. Malick is a director who makes you think, he virtually forces you to it. The way he portrays nature and its relationship towards us humans (and vice versa) is unbelievably stunning. The theatre was all quiet as if a hidden force had taken all their breath away. Awesome.Just like the way the old painting masters stunned the artistic world with their craft hundreds of years ago, Malick steers the art of movie-making in his very own direction.One can only admire his will to release films that go against the commercial stream of Hollywood. It is indeed fascinating that there are still moviegoers out there that appreciate quality and don't mind sitting in the theatre for 2 1/2 hours. I usually am under the impression that we're too much conditioned to the 100 minutes-movie nowadays and that effects and flat dialogue are destroying the art completely. We're sold for dumb. Luckily enough, the theatre I was in was almost sold out, but the average age as well as the intellectual standard was probably slightly higher than among the masses who went to see the sequel to 'Underworld' the same evening.As for 'The New World', Malick continues where he left us with James Caviezel's character in 'The Thin Red Line'. The connection is undoubtedly there. Colin Farrell, for once in a very quiet role, plays the troubled observer, the twisted conqueror of a new, unknown world and soon finds himself torn between the demands of his previous life and the chances of creating a new one and starting from scratch on the American continent. Yes, I'm usually not the biggest Farrell fan, but it's all in his sad eyes and tormented facial expressions. I think his talent just got wasted in the past years and I congratulate him for being able to break out of his stereotypical and flat tough guy image.Q'Orianka Kilcher is just plain astonishing. You could never tell that she was only 15 when the movie was shot. Her innocence and easiness is beautifully captured on screen and she fits the part perfectly. But the same goes for the entire cast, very good choice overall.I can't tell whether the historical background is depicted precisely enough. 400 years have passed and its certainly impossible to get it all straight. Therefore, I won't get into the discussion about the Native's looks or the English slur of that time. What I liked, however, is the last fourth of the movie and the juxtaposition of the New World vs. the Old World. What a weird scene that must've been, having Natives running around in English gardens. Priceless.Hopefully, Malick will let us see more of the story with a longer Director's cut or some bonus features on DVD (which I'll certainly buy). There were a couple of bits in the movie, especially towards the end, where time jumped way too fast and you really had to be attentive enough to grasp the story. And sometimes during the middle part, where Farrell and Kilcher are coming closer, there are a few repetitious scenes of them two out in the fields which could've been cut.Of course, this is not a perfect movie, but it comes very close to it. Maybe in a couple of decades, people will talk about it like they used to talk about a Van Gogh in an art gallery and say, 'See, that's a true Malick. Isn't it beautiful?'. He always lets you wait, but it's absolutely worth it.",10,13,27,21 January 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Better stay away from this movie
","This movie was slightly creepy, for various reasons. But more about this later.First of all, I really enjoyed the first M:I movie, and couldn't bear watching the John Woo sequel. So, with a free ticket in my hand and some pals coming along with me, I decided to go and see the third installment.The original score by Lolo Schiffrin has been so mutilated, they had better used the them song from the 60ies TV show. Anyhoo, here's the plot: The first act is tremendously poor. Who on Earth would have Germans hired as killers and assassins these days? Maybe the writers thought it as just plain cool, which it isn't. But this wasn't the only supposedly 'cool thing' in the movie. Of course, you blow up your own truck with all the unused equipment in it... Germany is displayed very, very convincingly (a dark industrial surrounding that could be anywhere in the Western World and sure;y there are wind power plants just outside of Berlin... LOL).The scenes at the apartment and at the MIF basis are very, very cheesy and I wonder whether personal insight's into a secret agent's life couldn't have been portrayed a tad bit more strained and dark. This is a film about secret agents, not some wishy-washy bubbly soap-opera, for sheep's sake.The musical score is annoying. It's this generic soundtrack that has been used so many times before. They probably thought it would help enhance the storyline, but where there is no storyline, it appears as if they had to cover up lengthy and faulty scenes and sequences by using this fake orchestra kind of score.Not a single character is drawn out, they all remain soulless, without a proper motive (apart from Hoffman's, whose aim is absolute cruelty and - later on - perfect retaliation). Only Ethan Hunt stands out as a sort of 'Ubermensch' who doesn't even catch a single scratch after a drone has just blown up a piece of the road. An explosion smashes him into a parked car... No injuries, he stands up and walks on... Very realistic.Then they give so much away. The scene inside the plane, after they've successfully kidnapped Hoffman's character. Rhames yells 'Ethan' about six times to Cruise. As if professional agents would call each other by name. Sure, that's an easy thing for the weapons dealer to count one and one together. Then the scene outside Vatican City when Cruise and his ally fake an 'Italian Conversation'. Aaaarghh... So much for clich√©s... Then seeing Cruise in a ministrel's robe... Made me laugh... And think of Cruise's past as a choirboy. What an irony. Of course, nobody seems to question a foreigner entering the center of the Catholic Church. Then the Germans appear again, later on at the bridge (somewhere in... California? Or Florida?). No idea, where the scriptwriters could imagine some KSK 9 guys show up in a helicopter somewhere in the States, in open water, without causing any noise or troubles... Logical reasoning, where have you gone?The only thing that really stood out in my viewer's experience was Philip Seymour Hoffman, and he probably was the reason why I originally wanted to see this flick. He's so damn cold and emotionless, yet he's able to play this really convincingly. Isn't this the irony when you look at Tom Cruise's facial expressions, repeating themselves in every single movie he makes. The way he fakes a smile, the way he tries to put on a stone-cold, serious face... Look at 'Top Gun', 'Days Of Thunder', 'Cocktail' or whatever... That's no actor playing a role, that's Cruise playing Cruise. And his eyes are so absent, you'd think he always with Katie Holmes and thinking about some new project that he's about to pull off to show off his greatness. I don't know, but Tom Cruise as an actor is overrated. 'Magnolia' maybe the only time where he actually showed a different approach. Otherwise, he often reminds me of a brick wall or a robot.The use of the 'Rabbit's Foot' is an old trick and a nod to Alfred Hitchcock and the 'Red Herring' device. Watch 'Vertigo' or 'Psycho' again, or look it up on a good website for more information.The creepy thing about this movie is the apparent similarity between Michelle Monaghan and Katie Holmes... The eyes, the shape of the face, the hair, the behaviour. Does this portray Tom Cruise's obsession with his current wife or what? Also, women in this movie are all weak characters, who are essentially losers and incapable of achieving anything successfully (apart from Monaghan's character at the very end). Further proof to that are the dialogues between male and female characters, which usually go like this: (Man) 'Trust me.' (Woman) 'I don't know what to do, I'm confused.' (Man) 'Promise you trust me.' (Woman). 'OK.' They had better done this movie without Tom Cruise in the main role and with less uberdimensional explosions, less CGI and maybe a storyline.But then again, it's the wonderful studio system that gives a bleep about the audience and continues pouring out garbage. Eventually, they'll lose their customers pretty fast. It will be too late before they've realized how bored the audience has become with the same standard blockbuster recipe each year... No fire, no compassion, no likable characters (Ethan Hunt's crew is never really introduced), no spirit, no ideas, all just a collage of old film tricks... It's really smelly. And I personally think this movie has a lot more to do with the philosophy of Scientology and Cruise's personal influence as a producer than one would maybe think.",4,7,14,8 May 2006
The Departed," A successful operation, but the patient died on the way to the ER!
","'The Departed' - like most other Scorsese movies - focuses on hormone-troubled males who hardly ever learn to grow up, entangled in an unforgiving society, playing their little games until they hit earth. The mob movie master has delivered another solid piece, with all necessary ingredients, but the result's rather half-baked.The whole Irish/Catholic setting introduction in the first few minutes, with a roaming, literally shadowy Jack Nicholson appears to be some kind of an odd mechanism, as it changes the focus and shifts the weight of the story towards him, a move he doesn't really deserve. It seems like today's moviegoer is inept at guessing the bigger picture of a story: Whereas it was intriguing to figure out who's who in 'Infernal Affairs' as the movie progressed, here it's all laid out from the start: What an insult to an intelligent audience. Therefore, the initial 10 minutes could've been left out entirely, but my guess is there were some contract ties interfering with the artistic concept, resulting in a beginning that serves but as one big show-off for key-player Nicholson. Speaking of cutting, the crude editing style took me by surprise: At various points throughout the movie, cuts are made in the middle of an action, especially the case with inserts, resulting in a sort of staccato-like viewing experience. In addition, the jump cut approach doesn't quite succeed: The various, random back-and-forth jumps within the storyline left me questioning their real purpose.When it comes to the plot, Scorsese adapted most crucial elements 1:1 (even going as far as stealing shots), but the remake boasts way too many extended scenes, including an Italian mafia subplot and trying to disguise the fact that Scorsese simply worked from a foreign template, thus culminating in a total running time of a close-to-unbearable 150 minutes. Unfortunately, many important puzzle pieces and details are dropped: The police academy background is nearly left out and also the fact that the original mafia boss once served as an instructor in the police squad. Other critics have already pointed out that the subplot involving the police chief (Martin Sheen's character) and his mole (DiCaprio's role) is entirely missing, and to make 'The Departed' even less convincing, DiCaprio's infiltration duty is reduced from an impressive 9 years (for Tony Leung in 'Infernal Affairs') to a meager single year. Furthermore, I didn't particularly like the whole 'swearing competition': For Scorsese, grown-up men are always ruled by their inherent animalistic nature, including excessive verbal and physical violence, but the amount of repetition in this picture distracts from what makes the actual script so fascinating - how and when the two snitches finally find out about one another. The dialogue is very poor for most part and the few instances where Nicholson is allowed to throw in some classic philosophy are rare. 'The Departed' also changes the conversation by the two mob members outside the caf√É¬© by a complete 180 degrees. Instead of unmasking undercover agents as people who 'look at you', it's now the ones that 'look away'. As for acting performances, I give an entertaining Mark Wahlberg the Number One spot (although his character doesn't exist in the original), closely followed by DiCaprio, who delivers a fine portrait of a troubled youth from South Boston that can't really cut his ties to his past. Nicholson does a memorable job at being displeased about life in general, as a fatalistic, old Irish mafia boss, although his decreasing physical agility and somnambulistic appearance makes me question his dedication for the movie. Sadly enough, Matt Damon does what he always does best in a movie he appears in: playing an unconvincing role. Not really being a character actor, equipped with an neverchanging haircut, stone-cold facial expressions, it feels to me as if he's never really emotionally present. His lacklustre involvement is a real letdown, and a definite loss for the picture. Compared to 'Infernal Affairs', there's only one 'big' female character, and even though Vera Farmiga manages to play a psychiatrist torn between the two sides of the same coin, the role demands way too much from her. I feel sorry that 'The Departed' omits a second girlfriend from the original (Andy Lau's annoying female sidekick), which makes it incredibly difficult to portray two women in one. Scorsese adds more responsibility to Farmiga's role, but in the end, she suffers the same destiny like her Hong Kong counterparts: she's too weak, too unimportant in the big scheme of things. What the pregnancy's supposed to add to the storyline, I don't know.Something quite distracting that I noticed were the constant background songs. Rarely does the film give you some quiet time, silence is a foreign word for Scorsese. As if the combination of hard-boiled, simplified dialogue and smashing action wasn't enough to please a younger audience, 'The Departed' serves you song after song, randomly piling up a plethora of music tracks that don't really serve any purpose. On the contrary, they are a real issue. They're neither location background music, nor a true soundtrack.To come to an end, I ask myself why the remake is almost an entire hour longer than the original. This movie is so artificially stretched and chewed out, hosts unnecessary lengthy scenes that don't really enhance the storyline or the movie overall. The original suspense is lost and makes way for a exhibition of overpaid actors. Two and a half hours for a tale that can be told in a much more concise and straightforward manner, as the four-year old Asian installment deservedly demonstrated.I doubt that the change of East Coast scenery will Scorsese do any good for next year's Oscar race. I fear that an aging man of such lasting creativity and intelligence has lost the plot yet again, after an abysmal 'Aviator', and that he'll end up just like Robert Altman did, with the possession of a statuette he won't really be able to cherish.",7,2,4,11 December 2006
