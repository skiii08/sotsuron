Black Swan," Recommended!
","It is a great movie. Not perfect but worthy seeing. After you watch it, you might still think about it over and over sometime. The actress did a stunning job. And it is surprising to see the end which I did not expect that ending.After finishing this movie, I still had some parts that puzzled me. I guess that's the success of this movie. I feel sorry for the ballerina. It is not that scary, but it is full of weird scene. You need to figure out what is real life and what is illusion on your own. That was challenging.Overall, you should go to see this movie if you like Shutter Island (Leonardo DiCaprio).",7,1,5,27 December 2010
