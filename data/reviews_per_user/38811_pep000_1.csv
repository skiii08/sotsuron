Blade Runner 2049," Extrordinary
","This is an art film masquerading as a Hollywood blockbuster, and is simply extraordinary. It succeeds on all levels- as a sequel to one of the best films every made, as an unsettling depiction of a future that feels very plausible, as a stunning visual art film, and as an engrossing detective/action film with philosophical overtones.I honestly couldn't how good it was. I'd see it soon if I were you, on an Imax screen.",10,3,10,15 October 2017
