Blade Runner 2049," Not sure what I saw - but I liked it
","The original Blade Runner was number one on my Si/Fi list and an almost perfect movie for that genre. That being said, I have to tip my hat to Denis Villeneuve for having the courage to make a sequel and wondered if that could be done well. But, I decided to give it a try with reservations. So I my gathered popcorn, Rasinettes and my cynical mindset, reclined in the new Lazy Boy chairs the movies have installed and waited to pick it apart. I did not have time to form any critical opinion. The movie is so visually stunning you are blown back in your chair and watch the visuals with some detriment to listening to the dialogue. To that point I think I missed a lot of plot points because of the fantastic Oscar quality Cinematography. I believe to enjoy this movie you might want to rent and view the original first. I only began to 'get it' some hours after I left the theater and had time to think about it. Having done that, I highly recommend it.",8,2,7,31 October 2017
