The Avengers," Nailed It!
","So, I've seen it twice now and I'm still finding it difficult to articulate just how great this film is.Usually, with films that are heavily promoted and feature characters that I carry a nostalgic reverence for, there is a fear that I'm going to dislike what has been done with it (and the older you get the greater the reverence for the formative years). I'm certainly carrying this trepidation as the release dates for The Amazing Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Rises close in (although in truth, I'll pay to see anything involving Spidey or Batman at least once).Not so with Avengers. I wanted to be there on the first day – Marvel Studios have proved their ability to translate their characters into cinema more than adequately with the wit and irreverence that made Marvel my true love during my younger days. All of the Marvel movies to date have been exceptional in their own ways, even the weakest of them (Iron Man 2 imho) had more than enough action and humour to make spending a couple of hours in their company a great way to live your life.With this in mind, Joss Whedon seemed an inspired choice to manage the first big screen outing and I'd been eagerly awaiting The Avengers since the post credits scene in Thor and my inner twelve year old was giddy with excitement at the teaser after Captain America.What I didn't expect was just how good it was going to be. And I still can't articulate why but here's a list of elements:<ul><li>It is the best parts of all the other Marvel movies multiplied by 1000.</li></ul><ul><li>The characters are all well cast and the actors seem to be enjoying their roles – RDJ isn't allowed to steal the show, Hemsworth keeps up the good work, Evans finds the humour in what could be a dry role it, Sam Jackson is Sam Jackson, Scarlett is filmed from behind in figure hugging leather and gets a character that has the intellectual strength not to have to kick ass to kick ass (if you know what I mean). Jeremy Renner does his best with the weakest written role and only has a couple of scenes to shine.</li></ul><ul><li>Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk is revelatory. And Tom Hiddlestone? Dude was born to play Loki, he is terrific.</li></ul><ul><li>A plot that makes sense and seems to propel itself forward without the need for any artificial nonsense (although, I'm sure we'll see the joins through its multiple DVD viewings, on the big screen it works and works well).</li></ul><ul><li>Action, action, action. 142 minutes in the blink of an eye.</li></ul><ul><li>HULK! - not too much dwelling on the downside of having a big green rage machine living inside you but proper glee in the smashing potential when it's appropriate.</li></ul><ul><li>Quotable lines aplenty: 'I'm going to put you on hold for a second.', 'He's adopted.', 'Mewling quim.', 'I'm always angry.', 'Hulk? Smash.', 'Puny God'.</li></ul>It's awesomeness writ large on the big screen. Joy. Cinematic Prozac. And yeahI have a girlfriend, she loved it too. So did my three kids and my ex wife is sick cos we're all raving about it and she hasn't seen it yet.The biggest compliment I can pay it? I am envious of those people who haven't seen it yet, I want another first time.And I want a Lego Helicarrier Escape playset! Dammit, I shouldn't have written this, now I want to see it again.",9,4,9,1 May 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Good But Not Great
","I love Spidey, always have and I was a big fan of Raimi's movies, even finding the freaky mess of Spider-Man 3 watchable.So, a reboot so soon after the last sequel seemed redundant, although, hey its Spidey so I'll be there.The Amazing Spider-Man is an entertaining couple of hours. The effects are good, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are both excellent, the supporting cast are variable (of which more later) but Martin Sheen and Sally Field are inspired casting choices for Aunt May and Uncle Ben.However, it is clear that the studio are playing a long game with this reboot and want to carry the story into at least a couple of sequels, using Nolan's Batman as a model no doubt.So TASM suffers from similar problems to Batman Begins, whilst there are elements that are excellent, it is slightly less than the sum of its parts and its pacing is incoherent to the point of being confusing. There are many longeurs in the early part of the film and a lot of messy rushing-about in the second part.Rhys Ifans' Curt Connors/Lizard is a curious choice for a cinematic villain and whilst there seems to be a striving to make him sympathetic in the way Raimi achieved with Dr Octopus in Spider-Man 2, his motivations are unclear and he descends into sociopathic drivelling.Denis Leary's Captain Stacey is similarly poorly sketched, particularly when compared to Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon in the Nolan Batman flicks.Neither of these are particularly the fault of the actors, the screenplay never really allows either of the characters to breathe as it concentrates too much of the minutiae of Peter Parker's rebirth as Spider-Man and his romance with Stacy's daughter, Gwen. Notably, both Garfield and Stone come away with the acting plaudits given that their characters are the two that are allowed to breathe and develop through the scope of the film.The pivotal Uncle Ben sequence also seems curiously rushed when compared to the Raimi version.The film then, ultimately suffers from the fact that it is undeniably a set up for a longer tale (made most obvious by the mid credits sequence at the end). In some ways, the film is entertaining enough for this to be forgivable but knocks it down a number of notches as a standalone flick (again much like Batman Begins).The only problem for the filmmakers now is for this to ultimately be recalled fondly, the sequel has be The Dark Knight quality. The origin is told, the throughline has been established - TASM 2 has to blow us away.",6,1,4,9 July 2012
The Exorcist," Aged, dull, empty propaganda
","The passage of time has not been kind to The Exorcist.A re-viewing of the flick will show that it is slow, dull and ultimately empty Catholic propaganda which doesn't make full use of its source material - for which we can only blame William Friedkin. This is not to say it is worthless, merely that it is too full of its own self importance to actually have anything worthwhile to say or to even deliver the modicum of shocks that one would expect from a movie that carries its reputation. As for the anecdotal stories of people vomiting, fainting (and even dying) at screenings - I don't believe a fricking word of it - unless cinema audiences in the seventies were a lot more sensitive - the reverse is probably true considering some of the violent and nihilistic movies that this decade produced. Exorcist II was nothing more than B movie exploitation fare that fails even within its own limited scope. Exorcist III - thats another story for another time.",9,2,6,20 August 2003
