Angels & Demons," The Best Comedy of the Year 2009!!!
","What a brilliant comedy full of ridiculous juxtaposition, and showcasing, in the style of The Princess Bride, that a really bad book can make a really funny movie by never building up any suspension of disbelief whatsoever. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer(True Romance) holds together scenes made entirely of unopposed magnets, the sheer cinematography and performances generally come across brilliantly. Though, overall, the story is terrible the cinematography manages, and at times it seems impossible, to maintain the movie's watchability over two and-a-half hours and captivate us all for a fun time.This is such a fun and funny movie, and the ending is brilliant!BRAVO, Ron Howard and crew!SPOILERS!!!Scientists are working in a lab at CERN; but the lab, rather than being on the surface, is located about ten feet from the ATLAS computer, which is actually hundreds of feet below ground and kept at almost absolute zero, and the warming and cooling of the complete hadron collider track takes months. So the movie implies that they have a very powerful heating system (for the comfort and survival of the scientists) operating against the biggest, most powerful refrigerator in the universe.The movie's ATLAS calorimeters--in reality, a specially galvanized steel substance that decays when bombarded by particle explosions--are little tubes (probably nanotubes) that all the particles travel through to be measured; and none of the particles go through any process of decay whatsoever... and the initial collision explodes incredibly slow, at a visible rate... and, of course, all of the scientists are silently proud of their achievement and softly smile to themselves, rather than experiencing rapturous joy at having performed a task none have ever done before and perhaps seeing for the first time in history the thing that some scientists have called The God Particle: the Higgs-Boson. They just softly smile and nod to themselves. HILARIOUS!!! ANTIMATTER STORAGE IN A BATTERY POWERED TEST TUBE!!! And the battery only lasts until Midnight; on the stroke.A group of papal potentials are kidnapped and left dead, or dying with ancient brands across their chests representing the four elements of ancient alchemy, which Robert Langdon(Hanks) refers to as the basic elements of science: Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water; and the ancient brands are printed in English! Not Olde English but Modern English. Olde English would have made sense. Eorde Fyr Wind Watar, or even Latin: Terra Incendia Ventus Unda. But no! It's in plain modern English! This major fault in a major plot point is gut-bustingly funny. Every time we see one we are reminded of the ludicrousness of the situation.While running through an underground maze for some reason, along with guys in flack suits for some reason, Robert Langdon(Hanks) comes to a dead-end. The guys in flack suits turn around and leave for some reason, even though they're escorting Langdon for some reason. Langdon, in the deep, deep depths of some ancient tunnel kicks aside a pile of leafs to reveal the path he must take. LEAFS!!! We're deep in the catacombs under Rome, the place probably hasn't been disturbed for years aside from the random Illuminati or Cardinal, and there's a pile of LEAFS down here. And the pile of leafs from outside, obviously concealing something are not what attracts Robert Langdon(Hanks)'s attention, he is actually drawn in by the fact that all the bricks are the same shape in a line, like a path that leads to the leafs. The leafs are never mentioned as being mysteriously out-of-place deep in a dusty catacomb.And for some reason there's a beautiful CERN scientist, Vittoria Vetra(Ayalet Zurer: she was in another movie that you never saw and probably never will), following Robert Langdon(Hanks) everywhere asking him why he's doing stuff. There's almost a reasonable explanation for her existence: she has a spare battery for the antimatter container, which has no timer on it, only blinking lights, but she can only change the battery if she has more than five minutes before the expiration of the old battery... which has NO TIMER. At one point, because a pen is not immediately available, she tears a page out of a priceless handwritten book by Galileo. If I were Langdon I would have assumed she was a spy trying to discredit my reputation, rather than a particle physicist, and turned her in immediately.A Catholic douses himself in kerosene and sets himself ablaze, a la Buddha!!!My favorite part of the movie is that all of the news reporters are standing on scaffolds and atop their news vans when the antimatter--instead of collapsing and dissipating into nothing when contacted by natural matter, this contact includes being looked at-- the antimatter explodes and washes a nuclear-bomb-like blast-wave over St. Peter's square-- leaving the entire rest of the Vatican, and all of Rome, undamaged--the explosion sends people flying and sliding, all the news reporters are tossed from on high, headfirst, really hard, at the road, most probably killed, and at least suffering concussions and brain hemorrhages. The next day they're all fine and everybody reports calmly without even a scratch.Cool part: At one point Robert Langdon(Hanks) flips through a book containing sample symetric anagraphs that did not make the cut as the movie's Illuminati emblem.The thing also contains micro homages to other Tom Hanks movies, for example I found myself muttering about how I bet he wished he'd remembered how to build the CO2 filter from Apollo 13, while trapped in the Vatican archives with a depleting air supply. The air supply was completely drained in a matter of less than an hour. And the first time we see Robert Langdon (Hanks) he is swimming, wearing a Speedo and, though all we've seen is his pale butt, I was instantly able to recognize him from his introduction in too-small tighty-whities from Big.And, seriously, there's almost two and-a-half hours of this stuff!",5,2,6,17 May 2009
Watchmen," Crapshow.
","Beneath me the city screams out like an abattoir full of retarded children.(This is a narrated line, narrated to nobody, from the actual movie. 'Abattoir' is an English American word refined from French. The word is most popularly familiar to Americans from The Simpsons. It means 'Slaughterhouse'. More specifically: a public slaughterhouse for sheep. Sheep metaphorically refers to a mob of blind followers. Retarded children are considered by Kirk Cameron to be the easiest possible Christian converts. So a slaughterhouse for sheep, full of sheep cries out. 'Silence of the lambs', in homage, anyone? Anyway, the way that I have used the line is... well, come to think of it, it's apparently the same way the movie did: I used it to set up the fact that everything that follows that opening line is me pointing at something, explaining why it's retarded and then killing it; which in itself explains, outright and forthwith, why if you like this movie you're probably none-too-bright)So, check this out, there's an impending NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST and you're capable; and have been given the job of PREVENTING THE DEATH OF EVERY LIVING BEING ON THE PLANET. And you're married. Your spouse has needs, too... but don't worry, you can multiply yourself and have alternate selves, so you can get with the wife AND save the world at the same time. Then, one night, you're DOUBLE TEAMING YOUR OWN WIFE BY YOURSELF while trying to save the planet, and this pisses her off. So she leaves you because you're able to perform a meaningful role at home, at work, and within the world at large without hurting people. That's why women leave their men, because they can care about more than one thing at a time.Can anybody say BRAINWASHING of clueless-about-women-nerds who ought to breed and maybe produce a better race of humans in the future but instead they're just Gaga over cartoons who could never breed with them or hurt them because the women in comic books, the only women they know, are HOT-AS-HELL but represented as insane and retarded which scares the fanboys from interacting with actual human people about actual human matters?THINK!!!I will not deny: the movie has brilliant cinematography, but I liked all of those shots better when Tim Burton and Michael Bay used them in Batman, Nightmare Before Christmas, The Rock, etc. The movie also contains ridiculous, overblown music video sequences throughout.The opening credits, full of live-action representations of those brilliant superhero paintings we all know and love was, I felt, heartwarming. But to do it to 'The Times, They Are A-Changing'? And I mean, the whole darned song. Balloney.The ease-in from the apartment to the black of Smiley's eye--all the way--was, for lack of a single-word appropriate adjective, too much. The story was very stupid and the characters were all very easily hateable.This was caprology and scatology: bad story, and smegmatic imagination on level scale with Ed Wood.BAD MOVIE!!!It's all right to admit that you made an error in judgment. That you threw away money, that you wish the world was a fantasy world; but that doesn't mean that just because a movie that's based on something you like got a big budget and was made by a slightly competent cinematographer was ever any good to begin with. It's all right to admit that something you like was made poorly.It is not all right to convince other people to throw away their money on garbage just because you want to pretend it's worth their life to like something you can only pretend you believe in. Fans of this movie may as well be religious zealots.",2,4,8,5 July 2009
Armageddon," And all over the south, before the emergency status drops, aryan children in overalls make soapbox space shuttles
","While I'll admit that this movie is clever in parts, like all of the government agents chasing down Bear (I love that one shot), this movie is lousy.If you own a copy of this movie, place it upon an anvil, yell 'This how we fix on Russia Space Station!' and smash it with a ridiculously large monkey wrench.There was another movie that was actually good, followed the same basic plot and came out at thhe same time and it actually had an asteroid hitting Earth, devastating millions and putting 6the tears of a vanquished humanity into my eyes... Deep Impact. I have noticed people saying that the movie is art because it made $600 million dollars at the box office which is like saying Jenna Jameson is an artist because she's the most popular porn actress of all time. This movie IS garbage, popular garbage but garbage nonetheless, see Deep Impact. Okay, Bruce Willis is an oilman who hates the idea of not having to drill for oil, so much so, that when protesters come near him, complaining about oil spills and environmental disaster, he drives golf balls at them and we all know that it doesn't hurt to get hit with a golf ball and you can't possibly be killed by it so, of course, it's funny.Ben Afleck CANNOT act!!!!!!!!!! Once upon a time, JOHN DENVER wrote a song called 'Leaving on a Jet Plane', which made sense with his line 'When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring,' implying that upon return he will drop to one knee and propose to his beloved, there is a reproduced track of the same song with the same line performed by a femalic moron for this movie in which, rather than augment the line to 'I'll WEAR your wedding ring', she keeps it the same, to suggest that she'll kneel down before her betrothed and demand a marriage now!If, no matter what, the guys are going to space, no chance in Hell they're not, what's the point of the psychological imbalance testing? How does Steve Buschemi get the sunglasses on inside his helmet?Where did Steve Buschemi get the high tech jeweler's eyepiece?We call him Hound Dog because he's horny. I do not know anyone who equates HORNY with HOUND DOG. The following comes into my mind upon hearing hound dog: Elvis, The Baskervilles, loud and raucus, blood hound, etc. but NOT horny. What does that mean to imply?How did NASA get a report on the total makeup of the planetoid(not asteroid) without sending off a probe and, if the thing is rotating erratically, how are they able to ensure any kind of sensible landing at all?Why is the planetoid shedding so much stuff? It is assumable that it has been travelling billions of miles and I think its own gravity and other radical objects in space would have worn it down to a hunk of fairly smooth and slightly cratered planetary material.What does, 'the size of Texas' mean?How does an atom bomb, less than a thousand feet into a planetoid, assumedly, as far across in every dimension as Texas, split the planetoid in half? How does the planetoid split from the 'front'(the end nearest Earth) when our team of heroes are working at its side?I'm sure it was fun to make, just toss off a bunch of prescripted catch-lines and get millions of dollars, but it is just so I.Q. diminishing to watch.Why do they specifically need Bruce Willis's drill design to cut through rock? Nasa has microwave matter splitters, for heaven's sake.Why do they need a team of oil workers to operate a drill?Why can't a NASA physicist put together a drill designed by an idiot?Why can't a NASA physicist understand how a solar sail works and why would he roll his eyes at the movies most sensible idea?What the hell does getting a 'C' average in astrophysics have to do with anything??THIS IS cinematic garbage! Watch Deep Impact, you might actually learn a whole lot of neat stuff and the movie is just as exciting as Armageddon, if not more so.",1,5,10,22 June 2006
The Terminal," Stephen Spielberg Stopped Sucking
","I don't know what happened to Stephen Spielberg after Schindler's List but it wasn't good. Historical drama after historical drama and they all sucked the hose dry. Here, Spielberg shows us why we love his craft so well. It's almost a more adult version of Hook. Victor N'vorsky flies in to Neverland to rescue Benny Goldson's autograph and then can't figure out how to fly home. Captain Hook of the airport wants him to handle it his way. The quarters scene is the same scene from Hook where the boy is messing with Panny's face. And all the while there's a cute little fairy trying to make sense of the whole thing. If there's one thing that Stephen Spielberg is good at it is making me want to sit still and stare at a wall for two hours and I'm glad that he's back to doing that.",4,4,9,6 March 2005
