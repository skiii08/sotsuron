The Avengers," The Heroes Unite
","From the beginning in the movie The Avengers there is an ongoing battle between an agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. and the evil Loki. After taking a staff with an unlimited amount of power called the Tesseract Loki planed on opening a portal to allow aliens to invade earth but the team S.H.I.E.L.D. had other plans and launched project Avengers. Recruiting the Marvel Super Heroes of earth: Iron Man a.k.a. Tony Starks, the Incredible Hulk a.k.a. Dr. Bruce Banner, Thor a.k.a. god of lightning, Captain America a.k.a. Steve Rodgers, Hawkeye a.k.a. Clinton Barton, and Black Widow a.k.a. Natalia Romanova to stop Loki and his alien army from taking over earth and possibly destroying it. I was impressed in how well they did in bringing all the characters together and connecting their story lines one way or another. A good example of how some the characters story line connected in the Avengers is Tony Starks a.k.a. Iron Man's dad was a great scientist/inventor. He was the genius that was able to turn Steve Rodgers into Captain America and giving him his powers by experimenting on him; making him into a great success. Tony knew very well about Captain America because of his dad telling stories about him. Years on down the road a scientist tried to recreate the experiment on Bruce Banner that was done to Steve Rodgers and gave him his powers but it went wrong causing him to change in to the Incredible Hulk When he gets angry. Thor's dad basically adopted Loki when he was a baby making Loki Thor's brothers. Thor was chosen by his dad to be the god of lightning and the protector of earth where all the Avengers live. All the characters had their own individual story line but somewhere in the line they connected to each other some more than others.The reason the Avengers were brought together was because Loki came through a portal in to the base of S.H.I.E.L.D. to take the powerful Tesseract so they made it their mission to recruit the Avengers to stop him from continuing with his plan. It wasn't easy convincing them but they all had their own motives as to why the thought they should help save the world. They had been keeping up with all the heroes without them know in case of a global emergency like this. Bruce asked Black Widow 'how did you find me?' and she responded 'we never lost you we have been keeping up with you'. He was not real easy to convince to help but they really need him on their team. Iron man was not very hard to find but he found his own reasons to team up with the Avengers and save the world. After missing out on the first war he fought in Captain America did want to miss out on this battle so he was ready to fight with the team. Thor saw the evil his brother Loki was causing and decided to join the Avengers in a battle against him. That is how the Avengers got brought together after having their story lines cross.Before all the characters got together to become the Avengers they all had their own movie telling their own story line as to how they got their powers and got where they were. All their story lines crossed each other at some point some more than others but at the end they all got brought together by team S.H.I.E.L.D. The epic battle of having to stop the evil Loki and his alien army from taking over earth is what brought all the heroes together at the end of it all. Even though some of the stories were connecting more than others they all got connected by the battle equally with each character having their own role. The connection between the characters was well plotted out in this movie.",8,1,4,23 September 2013
