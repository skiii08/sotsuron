Iron Man 3," Marvel At Its Best
","This movie is an example of Marvel at its best, especially for what they have been trying to do with the Iron Man/Tony Stark.From the beginning, this was a story about the human not the superhero. A man constantly at war with himself, who he is, and who he wants to be. After the events of the Avengers movie, Tony finally breaks. The man who was always calm and in control, finally breaks. This truly peels the man out of his armor, both literally and figuratively. This is the first time that we see Tony Stark as himself and get a look inside his head. It really is fascinating and refreshing to take a deeper look just how fragile a man truly is underneath their facade.At one of the low points in his life, where he is set off by 6 year olds, and withdrawals from those closest to him, it takes something truly drastic to come out of his funk and become the best person he could be.The best scene I have seen in any Marvel movie is his talk with Pepper in the garage about the after math of New York.This is truly Marvel at its best. 9/10",9,13,20,6 September 2014
Begin Again," Great Movie
","This is one of the best movies that I've seen this year. Been waiting for this a long time. I know this was never expected to be an award contender, but I really enjoyed it and would like to see at lest one for anything.Keira Knightley is the best I've seen her in years and Mark Ruffalo does what he does best. Both were phenomenal. Adam Levine played his part very well.The music, the cinematography, character and story, all great. 8/10 This is definitely a movie to watch if your feeling down and want to forget your problems for a while.",8,1,4,30 August 2014
Interstellar," Mind Blowing
","This movie was utterly mind blowing. Everything was perfect. The acting, directing, score, editing. It had just the right of everything that makes a great movie. Facts, sincerity, intrigue, etc. Nolan took something that is seemingly impossible to do and pulled if off flawlessly (again). What started out as an already amazing concept was turned into a cinematic masterpiece. The simple scope of it all is enough to boggle minds, but then to ground it in reality and make it understandable is the true magic.Almost 3 hours, and worth every second. This is, hands down, the best movie Christopher Nolan has ever made, and the best Sci-Fi movie, I have ever seen, and my ever see.",10,2,6,22 January 2015
Now You See Me," Work of Art
","This movie is truly a work of art. Based on legend, rooted in childhood fun, this has everything everyone has once loved.The way it plays out though is the real trick. It not only keeps the 4 horsemen in front of the FBI, but keeps the movie itself in front of audience. Never ceasing to amaze until the credits begin rolling.The movie is fun, hands down. The effects are great. The actors, the cinematography, everything, was all amazing. My favorite part was the story itself. As a screenwriter myself, this is one of stories that never ceases to amaze me. The depth, the detail, the reveals and the nuance that went into this is incredible. Going back 30+ years to set the present in motion.For the excellent work of the writers, I give this movie at 10/10.",10,7,12,1 September 2014
Selma," Powerful and Compelling
","Paul Webb was bold enough to write this story of one of the greatest human rights leaders in the history of the world. He wrote a strong compelling, and completely real representation of the events surrounding Selma.Ava DuVernay had the audacity to direct and put this story on the big screen. She nailed it perfectly. She captured the emotion of the man, his followers, and everyone involved, including those against him.The cast also nailed every single part, every emotion, and every beat.It is raw yet polished at the same time, and makes the viewer feel as if they were with King the entire way.This was powerful and compelling from the beginning to the ending credits. One of the films about African American struggle",9,6,15,13 January 2015
Her," Good Movie
","Now this was a good movie. Good story, good actors, good visuals, everything. It was even a good performance by Scarlett Johansson, even though she is never seen but only heard.She was not restricted by typical human behavior and speech patterns. As a constantly evolving program, she had the freedom to step outside conventional lines and put on a great performance.I could close my eyes and just listen to this movie all the way through, and it would still be as great as watching the screen. Knowing that you would never see a main character, the creators did an excellent job of enhancing what the audience would experience i.e. the sound.My only problem with the movie was the ending. I wish they could have continued for a bit longer (even just a few minutes) to explore what happens to Theodore and even Amy after their OS' left.",9,0,1,2 September 2014
Furious 7," One Last Ride!!
","This was sold as One Last Ride. And it felt just like that. Throughout the film, you get the feeling that this is the finale for this incredible franchise.It paid incredible homage to the previous installments. From characters, to story lines, everything seemed to come full circle. Even some of the sequences made you flash back to when you first saw something identical or similar years ago.It reminded us of why we love every character tied to this franchise, present and past.As someone who quite literally grew up with these movies, I feel like I have closure. I don't need another one. I've watched every Fast and Furious movie dozens of times each, hundreds total. I used to looks forward and impatiently wait for the next movie. With this one, that urge is gone. The journey feels complete. It was our last ride.Faced with the huge challenge of finishing this movie without Paul, I think everyone involved with this movie made all of the right moves, all the way up to the very end. It did Paul Walker justice.",10,71,86,6 April 2015
