Blade Runner 2049," Powerful
","Sincerely I didn't like too much the first one, but in this case I have to change my opinion. I've really loved this movie. The cinematography is amazing, and Jenkins have to win the Oscar. Gosling and all the actors are really inside the world designed by Villeneuve and the script, that maybe in some sequence didn't work so good. I highly recommend to see this movie, even if you don't like too much the noir science fiction film.",9,1,7,28 October 2017
