Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What can I say? It has Ewan McGregor. ;-)
","Mr. McGregor is especially tasty in this Star Wars installment. 'Kewl' hairstyle, too (i.e., that sweet little braid), but it's so short for such beautiful hair.As for the queen... in our household, a discussion of the logistics of 'electing' a queen always turns into a rehashing of the famous scene from Monty Python's Holy Grail ('*We* didn't vote for you!') But I suppose some would say that queens WOULD be elected on a planet with a name like 'Naboo' (wasn't 'Naboo' a Hanna-Barbera character?)Ah, well, the special effects were pretty nifty (the same reason that the plot-light Independence Day needed to be viewed on the big screen). I don't s'pose that, one of these sequels, the day will be saved by something *other* than a single lucky laser blast by a member of the Skywalker clan. (Cliche much?)Sheer eye-candy... don't go to it expecting to see Laurence of Tatooine, 'cos you'd be sadly disappointed.",Null,0,0,24 June 1999
