Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Exploitative
","Very crude and unintelligent exploitation comedy that leaves a bad aftertaste. What is strange that Sacha Baron Cohen thinks that by making fun of his own Jewish Heritage it somehow also gives him the right to make fun of Romania, Kazakhstan, America and basically play on people's good intentions by misguiding them intentionally for the sake to build a cruel joke. It is the sort of film a jaded and uneducated 16 yr old would make. And this inanity is compared to Monty Python? Oh please. I think films such as these do not care who they offend. Therein lies the problem. Someone who is masterful at creating comedy doesn't need to rely on cheap shots at other people or cultures, and can create more hilarity without exploitation. Save your time and watch something more worthwhile.",1,2,5,15 June 2008
The Orphanage," Excellent tense horror/drama
","This film has a few shocks (and you will jump in parts) but overall it relies on creating a creeping tense atmosphere that is simply chilling. I love the fact that you never really know if the atmosphere is benign or evil until the very end.Acting is perfect, especially the lead role (Laura character).When the end came I was really moved, there is a lot of emotional depth to this film behind all the horror.If you like a good tense film with a touch of horror and drama with a good story, then I throughly recommend this film. Best film I have seen in a while, and good to see another excellent film from Spain, I was pleased also by 'REC'. 10/10.",10,2,6,11 October 2008
Underground," Fantastic
","This is amazing film about independence, betrayal, loyalty, love, pain, struggle and everything inbetween. Cinematography is amazing, amongst the best I've seen. No Hollywood rubbish or clichÃ© here, this is a totally originally picture that is vivacious and poignant. All the actors give great performances as well. A fitting tribute to Yugoslavia and those who lost their lives trying to preserve it. I must see the five hour long picture of this, because this is real cinema, pure, and untainted. So if you are tired of the many films of the West that are coated and lavished in high production but little substance, then try and track this one down, because it says a lot more than many films, much of it without words. (Imagery is incredible). Highly recommended!",10,7,12,18 March 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Excellent Mystery Thriller
","Having now seen all three films, I cannot really say which I preferred, but as it started here, this is a fantastic introduction to Lisbeth, Micke and all at Millennium.There is much suspense, twists and turns, and a plot that keeps building and keeps the viewing experience riveting. I have to say that the acting is fantastic and convincing, as is the directing. I hope to see more of these actors and actresses. I must keep an eye out for other films they have been in or will make, as it is not so easy to see some lesser known Swedish films here in UK.In this particular episode, we learn of related crimes and why possibly Lisbeth is being targeted. Micke is the fearless and determined reporter, even to the point of risking his own life. He is committed to the truth, and reminds me a bit of Mulder's Character in the x files. One man on a mission to expose and dig for the truth.9/10, highly recommended!",9,3,8,11 April 2010
The Descent," Nothing special
","I'm amazed that this film is getting so many high reviews, particularly as it rips off so many horror films that have gone before. For example...the the ominous heartbeart sound...ripped off from John Carpenter's 'The Thing'. The scene in the hospital where she's running down the corridor...Hellraiser anyone? Then the 'monsters' themselves are a complete rip off of the mentally unbalanced guy in the British horror 'Creep'. If you've seen this film you'll see what I mean. Well if you find a guy prancing around with a bit of make-up and really bad choppy editing so you can hardly see what's happening scary, good for you.The actresses were great to be fair, I just feel that nothing inventive was done much here. My advice, if you want a real scary horror, go and see one of the Asian horrors like 'Cello', 'The Shutter', 'Ju-on' or for real suspense 'The Thing'. This is a 'jumpy' film in the style of 'I know what you did last summer' and all those type of films. It is not scary or a horror, I would describe it more as a slightly suspenseful thriller. Conclusion, good acting but bad unoriginal realisation and shameless stealing of ideas from other films and so 4/10 from me.",4,4,7,22 January 2006
Love Actually," Terrible but accurate portrayal of cringeworthy aspects of British culture
","I wanted to see this after recommende by a friend but I found it so embrassingly bad that after 30 minutes I had to leave. The problems: all too typical British stereotypes, poor one dimensional characters, the over emphasis on sex, infidelity etc and not real love, and the cringeworthy subtle anti-americanism. Plenty of foul-mouthed characters who are superficial on every level (unloveable and a cliché). It's very soap opera-ish and not really a comedy. This film made me embarrassed to be British, it sort of highlights all the worst aspects of the culture here in some ways... if you'd like to see a real romantic film, try 'il mare' or for romantic comedy try 'my sassy girl' (Yeopgijeogin geunyeo). Made me angry, but if you love the British societal culture here and love the typical British insular and short-sighted way of life you'll probably love it.",1,5,9,14 March 2009
