3:10 to Yuma," Very good film-even if you are not into Westerns
","I am not a Westerns film person. Never have been.I have never seen the original film.Bought the tape because I am a fan of Russell?s.A very good film, good acting around.Did NOT need the partial female nudity.It well deserved the critical acclaim it received when released.DVD package-MISTAKE, NO CHAPTER SEARCH LIST OR ANY FILM INFORMATION INSIDE.Violent as you would expect. Do NOT see it if you are not a fan of such films & scenes.Good extras on the DVD package. That surprised me. Lately I have been disappointed by other DVD releases having very little as for extras on them.Could have appreciated a 2 disc package but I will take what I can get.REVIEW OF COURSE FOR THE DVD OF FILM.",9,1,4,8 January 2008
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Fantastic & wonderful film
","What a fantastic film!! Original.Fun.Makes you laugh & feel better when you watch it when you are blue.'Walt sent me.' Favorite scene, Donald & Daffy playing the piano together & the argument that starts.Favorite lines though.Jessica to Roger 'Oh, honey bunny.' Roger to Jessica 'Oh, love cup!' Great use of all those classic cartoon characters!! Can watch it anytime!! Is this 10 lines now WITHOUT THE SYSTEM KICKING THEM TOGETHER TO MAKE LESS THAN 10? Makes me even crazier.",10,0,3,24 February 2006
Meet the Parents," Decent film
",I enjoy this film & it's follow up 'Meet the Fockers'. Certainly NOT the best film ever made-far from it. Enjoyable. I am NOT a fan of Ben Stiller's. This is 1 of the 4 films I like where he is in a starring role. The other 2 'Night at the Museum' & 'There's Something About Mary' HE BASICALLY PLAYED THE SAME ROLE IN ALL 3 FILMS. A nobody reacting to things going on around him & overreacting.I actually like the follow up film more than the original. Another negative of the original: Owen Wilson Only got to see him briefly in the 2cd film.Randy Newman's same old music-we've heard in films over the years & they all sound the same.Good NOT GREAT extras on the DVD package.Hard to feel for Stiller's character in either film when his character lies all the time.The speeding to get back to Jack's (DeNiro's) house because of the Jinx? the cat lost bit. WHERE WAS THE NEEDED REACTION FROM THE OTHER CHARACTERS ABOUT GREG SPEEDING & BEING UNSAFE?,7,1,1,31 August 2008
Mulan," Wish Disney still made films of this quality
","It is a shame that Disney has not produced any animated films in recent years of this quality, with the exception of the Pixar films.A truly wonderful film.A good story. Shows great respect & importance of family. And, even though based in a time long ago, the film sets a standard for female roles.Great music, last Disney film, in my opinion to have a soundtrack of this quality. SHOULD have won an Oscar for the soundtrack.I love Mushu. One of my favorite Disney characters.Girl/young woman can learn a lot from the Mulan character.Beautiful animation with this film as well.I never get tired of this film.",8,4,5,24 February 2006
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Not as good as I thought it would be SPOILERS
","As a long time Star Wars fan and collector of course I was interested in seeing this film and add it to my video collection.We knew most characters would not make it into the storyline of the first film.I am disappointed with the film.Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera character. He did nothing. Save Jyn then disappeared just to send her on her way to get the Death Star plans. Killed off before half way through the film. Disappointing.New droid K-2SO. Did not like the character at all. Former Imperial Droid. They sure did not reprogram that droid well. I did not like most of the characters responses & actions. So the only good droid activity in the film was the R2-D2 and C-3PO appearance.CGI Tarkin I liked how the character looked but they did not get the voice, close but not quite good enough. The short CGI Leia. One word & very short screen appearance. Did not really liked how the character looked, not as good a job as they did on Tarkin.I was looking forward to seeing Vader. Does not get much screen time but I was disappointed on how his voice sounded. They got James to do the voice again so why did it sound like they turned the sound down on the voice? I did not like that, otherwise his limited screen time was good.The final battle with the X-Wings and the AT-AT's was good. Overall though some of the effects were not up to Star Wars standards.So sorry to say as a long time fan I was disappointed & awaiting The Last Jedi.",6,2,5,9 April 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Yo Ho, Yo Ho, I like this film
","Going into this film I thought I like the ride more than I will this film.That is still true but.....This film is fun. And, much better than I thought it would be.Bought the soundtrack, it fit perfectly to the film.As a woman, loved looking at Orlando.Knightley we can do without. The more I see of her the less I like her. Too much.Depp was great as Jack.Looking forward to the 1st sequel & seeing Keith Richards who the Jack character was based.A draw back though, the action scenes, although good, are a bit too long. Could have been trimmed.'Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirates Life For Me'.",8,0,3,7 March 2006
Beauty and the Beast," SHOULD have won best picture!!!!!!
","The only animated film to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar!!And, it should have won that award!!Too bad the Best Animated category had not been started yet.What a classic film.Beautiful film to look at. Wonderful music. Great characters.Most likely my favorite Disney animated film of the 'current' cycle of their films.I have NEVER seen the winner of the Best Picture for 1991 Oscar. I tried. Watched a few minutes of it once. That tells me something.I can watch this film, however, over and over and not tire of it.How many films can you say that about?",9,4,5,21 February 2006
The Mummy," I really enjoyed this film!!
","This film to me is just plain fun. A good sense of humor & action.Cast perfect in their roles. Far superior to the sequel.A good part of a film to me is if the film has at least 1 scene you can watch over & over again. That scene is near the end when the guard mummies come alive & chase the Rick character until Jonathan says the words to get them under control.Special effect just perfect. Unlike the sequel where they just keeping coming at you & are WAY OVER THE TOP & IN PLAIN WORDS, JUST OVER DONE.Can watch this film anytime.10 lines now.",8,0,0,21 February 2006
The Jungle Book," My all time favorite Disney film
","If I had to choose my all time favorite classic Disney film, I put them in to 2 groups, between the older & newer film, this would be my favorite of the classic/older films.Why? The music!! The Sherman Brothers out did themselves with this one, just like they did with the Oscar winning music from 1964?s ?Mary Poppins?.Without question, my all time favorite Disney song 'I Wanna Be Like You' with Louis Prima.The music from this film I can play over & over again.Then, the scenes in the film with the music I can play over & over as well.Disney NEEDS RIGHT NOW, A SPECIAL EDITION DVD WITH EXTRAS FOR THIS FILM.No doubt in 2007 they SHOULD release a 40th anniversary edition on DVD. Will purchase it promptly.Great voice talent for this film as well.",10,0,1,2 March 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," The least favorite of the 3-DISNEY GIVES FILM SPOILERS
","This review is written per the DVD release so the comments below are for that DVD package the 2 disc 'special edition' & of the movie itself:The last film of the series (maybe) is my least favorite.Not as fun as the first two films. How many spoilers does 1 want here?Killing off multiple characters (will not say which here not to spoil the surprise to someone who has not watched the film yet) except to say 1 character brought into this film alone & with the notable actor playing the part gets killed off what half way through the film. Badly done Disney.I did enjoy, like in the 1st film, the lines taken from the Disneyland attraction.OK, the problems with the DVD package:1. Those HORRIBLE, little flip open plastic cases I hate these things!!! 2. Disney giving away spoilers INSIDE THE DVD PACKAGE!! I did not get to see the film in the theater, so when I bought the DVD & saw the packaging/inserts inside 1 of them gave away plot points. Disney, you should know better than that. 3. Limited edition? Ha ha, available until 9-30-08",7,0,1,7 December 2007
"Monsters, Inc."," My favorite Disney/Pixar film
","This is my favorite of the Disney/Pixar films BEFORE the recent Disney buying Pixar.And, I have enjoyed it more with each viewing.It was the only film of the Disney/Pixar releases I saw in a theater.'23/19'.I really like the Sulley & Mike characters.And, a plus for me with a film is if there are scenes you can play over & over again. This one is when Sulley thinks he is watching Boo going through the garbage crusher. The faces they had the character make. Priceless!!I do not care for Randy Newman's music. To me, I have not enjoyed any of his music for the Disney/Pixar films he worked on. And, this was the one he won the Oscar for.The one character I did not like was Celia. I would have liked the character more if a better script for the character had been done.Overall though, a well done film.",9,0,1,7 March 2006
American Beauty," I do NOT like this film.
","Are negative comments about films not welcomed here?People will disagree with me & that is fine. Everyone is entitled to their opinion.I do NOT like this film. And, I have no problem saying it.And, this comment should post. Only fair.Spacey did NOT deserve the Oscar, his second, for this film. Russell should have received it for 'The Insider'.I have watched this film twice on cable TV.Oscar winner for Best Picture. Best Picture, not in my mind.Critic love it.It made money at the box office.Can someone explain this to me................My big hang up with this film, the unnecessary 'taking off of clothes' scenes.Every 'taking off of clothes' scene in the film could have been shot another way & NOT hurt the film.This is an error for the film makers.I did not like 1 character in the film.A poor choice for a Best Picture winner.",1,3,8,6 March 2006
Heartbreak Ridge," A good Clint film
","I have always liked this film.I am not normally into War films.But, this one is good.I really liked Clint & Marsha's characters. They made the film for me.Their characters were written well.But, this character, 'Stitch' Jones, of course I understand the reason for this character. You got tired of him the second the character appeared & you just want him to go away.A point here, there was NO draft at the time when Granada happened. So, if all of these men had to sign up ON THEIR OWN to get into the Army why did not ONE of them are about doing a good job before 'Gunny' took over? Yes, I know, just a point in the script.And, another point, having a commanding officer who not only went by the book but OVER DID THE BOOK. We saw the same in 'Good Morning Vietnam'.A good film.",7,1,3,9 March 2006
Aliens," The BEST of the 4!!!
","I saw this film before I saw the original that started it all.By far, the best of the 4!!!! Action. Great, just perfect.Sigourney deserved her Oscar nomination for the film.Music was perfect. I can listen to the soundtrack over & over.The faults you can find with the film: 1. Bit over long 2. Too much time wasted on 'minor' or supporting characters.Special editions on video & DVD are good to watch.The final 2 sequels were unnecessary & fail. Their failure made worse by how good this 2cd film in the series was.More than 10 lines now.",8,2,5,24 February 2006
Enchanted," Good Disney film
","I waited until I saw the film on pay cable before I bought it. I wanted to make sure I liked it before I purchased it.It is a good Disney film. Putting the live action flip into a tried & true fairy tale Disney formula with the young woman to be rescued from the prince & living happily ever after.I was glad Susan got the part of the Queen. She did a good job. BUT, HER ROLE WAS TOO SMALL. We done see her until the end of the film & before that just her voice in a few scenes. I would have loved to have seen her take off with the role.Let?s see. Dempsey got the role because of his hit ABC show. I found his role & performance boring. Went no where.The film SHOULD have won Oscars for the music. Shame it did not with Oscar winner Alan Menken at work again. Sure beats that 'you've heard it once you've ever one of Randy Newman?s music for the Disney/Pixar films'.Amy Adams did an OK job as Giselle. Just, her performance was just missing 1 little spark in my opinion.Beautiful to look at. The animation parts are normal Disney the best you can get. Kids will like it, if you are an adult & a Disney fan you will too.",7,1,2,7 September 2008
Meet the Fockers," Better film than the 1st GOOD NOT PERFECT FILM
","I Like this film better than the 1st. Why. Adding Dustin Hoffman & Barbra Streisand.I am not a fan of Barbra?s but she & Dustin were great in their roles to me. Added with DeNiro 3 Oscar winners. The 3 of them with Blythe Danner are perfect in their roles.Teri Polo has a role that is just a watcher of course. Now, I am NOT a fan of Ben Stiller. He does his usual routine in this role as he did in the 1st & in 'There?s Something About Mary'. Same lying, put out then blows his top role. Wish they could have gotten a better actor for the role. And, we MOST DEFINITELY could have done WITHOUT Owen Wilson in both films.As for the DVD, it is a good package. I like extras & this one has the kind I like. Deleted scenes, bloopers, etc.A BIG MINUS FOR THE DVD, IT HAS THE HORRIBLE LITTLE FLIP OPEN FLAPS ON IT.Otherwise, you should enjoy the film.REVIEW FOR DVD WIDESCREEN/2005",7,0,0,23 July 2008
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Good, but story problems
","I should have liked this film more than I do.Having been a dinosaur ?fan?, I guess that would be what you call it, since I was a kid I like all 3 of the Jurassic Park films.Being a woman, the world thinks that is unnatural.The problem with this film is the story line & subplots.OK, we knew from the first film Ian Malcolm had 3 kids. Why did we have to make the girl African American? NOTHING AGAINST African Americans in any way, but why did they have to so this unnecessary subplot so we had to guess about the girl?s mother & the film had a couple of characters do the same thing. Unnecessary, not needed for the film.A pet peeve of a scene I AM SICK & TIRED OF SEEING IN FILMS & TELEVISION SHOWS. When a character is wearing & listening to a walkman WHY CAN THEY NOT EVER HEAR ANYTHING ELSE? Sorry, I have had a walkman since the 1980?s & I HEAR PEOPLE TALKING AROUND ME & other noises in my area. After the double T-Rex attack on the trailer the rescue of Jeff, Julianne & 'National Treasure' Vince Vaughan went on TOO long. Scene should have been shortened.Good film, but Steven, it could have been MUCH better.",7,1,2,2 March 2006
The Little Mermaid," Very good Disney film
","The Disney film that put Disney BACK on the map for animation.A wonderful film.Sebastian is one of my favorite Disney characters.Great music, glad it won the Oscar.I admit, Ariel is my LEAST favorite of the Disney princesses. She did not listen to her father a lot & I did not find that a good trait for the character.Still a beautiful film.Can not till the October 2006 special edition DVD.Still, I already have the film widescreen/letter box on both laser disc & DVD.I will replay a couple of Sebastian scenes over & over because they are so funny.A good part of any film for me.",8,1,1,12 March 2006
Ghostbusters," Just as funny today as when released ?Who you going to call??
","The 2cd best film of 1984 in my book. Course, since I am an Indiana Jones fan & collector you know what my favorite was.I find the film just as funny today as when it was released.Bill at the top of his form. Wish he still made films like this. The entire cast was perfect. And, if Belshui had been alive Bill's role was supposed to have been for him originally.Great music.And, so many lines you can quote. Special effects don?t look as good today as they did in 1984. A minor set back due to the age of the film.'Who you going to call?' 'Ghostbusters!!'First time I had ever seen or heard Larry King. Sure wish it had been the last time. :(",8,0,0,20 February 2006
Slap Shot," Funny film Hanson Brothers!!
","Being a woman & a NON sports fan you would not think I would like this film.I love it!! Always have.Dark comedy. Meaning how the Reggie character got the team to win games.The Hanson Brothers!! My word, I play the scenes with them on the ice over & over again.Could have done without the 'taking off of clothes' scenes in the film.Good follow up to 'The Sting' between Paul & George Roy Hill.'Go Get'm Killer!!'I have never tired of this film over the years.",8,0,3,5 March 2006
Men in Black II," Not close to the original
","As much as I enjoyed the original, I did NOT enjoy this one that much.Took them half an hour to get Tommy into the film after K's retirement.He was the reason I was first in the door opening day for the first film.WE NEEDED HIM IN THAT FIRST HALF AN HOUR.No explanation as to what happened to Laurel after she became 'Black' at the end of the first film.Course, we get Will being Will. Same role we have seen him do over & over. Yawn, wake me up.The story about Laura Vasquez being a Princess.That was kind of lame.Did like making Frank the dog a 'Black' for this film.The original ideas from the first film got lost in this one.They were sorely needed.A poor follow up.",6,0,2,9 March 2006
The Insider," Russell SHOULD have won an Oscar for this role!!
","I did not know the details of this situation when the film came out in 1999.Briefly heard about it when it happened & forgot about it.Great film.Russell SHOULD have won the Oscar for this role, not Spacey in that 'Naked American Beauty' movie.He did a brilliant job in this role.I did NOT like the wife character of Jeffrey's in the film. She was USELESS. Let him do ALL the work, go through all these problems & leave him. All she did was cook & sit around the house all day. I am not a fan of Pacino. This is only the 3rd film of his I have seen. But, was this role no big deal for him, he plays the same type of characters? Like I said, I do not know his work by seeing his films, but from just clips from other roles of his, looked like he could have done the role blind folded.I am noting here the short, but good role done by Bruce 'D Day' McGill. So, his first of 2 roles where he worked with Russell.",8,3,4,2 March 2006
Men in Black," A fun film, much better than the sequel.
","I was first in the door opening day for this film.I am a fan of Tommy's.He was 100% perfect in the role of K.Will, doing Will. Nothing special about his role or performance.The film was fun & original.Course, having a slot machine made from the 2 films. Fun to play.Rip Torn was good.Mikey.The bug guys.Frank the dog.Good, original film.BELOW IS THE POSTED COMMENT TO 'MEN IN BLACK 2'. Once again, the positive response will NOT post but the negative one will: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120912/usercomments-574 As much as I enjoyed the original, I did NOT enjoy this one that much.Took them half an hour to get Tommy into the film after K's retirement.He was the reason I was first in the door opening day for the first film.WE NEEDED HIM IN THAT FIRST HALF AN HOUR.No explanation as to what happened to Laurel after she became 'Black' at the end of the first film.Course, we get Will being Will.

The Mummy Returns," Not anywhere close to the first film.
","I had high hopes when I first saw this film. I was let down.Where was the fun? Film made just to make money & to great 'another franchise'. Course, that did NOT work.Title 'The Mummy Returns' to me means the Mummy is back & HE IS THE MAIN BAD GUY THAT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH YET AGAIN. What a supreme let down when he goes down in order to make room for the 'TERRIBLE LOOKING, BAD SPECIAL EFFECT'. Scorpion King.The kid, Alex, TERRIBLE. Badly written, so it was badly acted by the boy.The director said in commentary on the DVD about the special effects & he over does them. IN THIS FILM, THIS DID NOT WORK. Way too much.",6,0,1,21 February 2006
A Beautiful Mind," Russell SHOULD have won the Oscar, great film
","This is a wonderfully put together film.Russell SHOULD HAVE WON THE Oscar FOR THIS FILM. NOT FAIR HE DID NOT.I think Ron & Brian did a great job on this film & they did deserve the Oscars they won for it.They work Russell did for the role was incredible.Christopher Plummer did a good job, his 2cd role working with Russell.I did not care for Bettany. I understand the part for the film, I did not like him in it. But, because of this, he got to work with Russell in Master & Commander.I am NOT a fan of Connelly's, but she did a good job in the role.Course, some people took offense that the film was NOT exactly 100% accurate. It is a film, not a documentary.And, I know some people did not like the film. I disagree with them.A good piece of film making.",8,1,4,8 March 2006
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," ONLY Will Ferrell movie I like
","I had caught this film on pay cable when it came on in 2005.Surprised me I liked it. At the time of release, it was original idea for a film I thought.It is the ONLY Will Ferrell film I like where he is the lead character.Now of course EVERY ear he does a similar film like all the sports films basketball, NASCAR & ice skating where this good Anchorman idea keeps being repeated. The cast were perfect in their roles. Did NOT need Luke Wilson though. Unnecessary. And, I do NOT like the Wilson brothers.Now, the DVD package it's.I expected more since it is a 'Unrated, Uncut, & Uncalled For!'. 1. Has those HORRIBLE little flaps tat are a pain & terrible to have to open up. 2. NO chapter search list or any information on the film inside.Good soundtrack for the filmINPUTTING THIS REVIEW FOR THE UNCUT DVD.",7,2,2,13 July 2008
American Gangster," American Gangster
","I was looking forward to seeing this film.I was not disappointed.Russell (the reason I bought this DVD package) was great. Denzel did a good job as well.Interesting story to follow.The film is long but in this case you do not mind. You do NOT get bored.I did NOT like however the unnecessary nudity. AND WE DID NOT NEED TO SHOOT THE DOG.Excellent DVD package. Although some of the extras were TV specials or parts of programs I had already taped.It is, of course, violent.If you are a fan of Russell ?s, Denzel?s or Ridley?s you will enjoy the film.I input this review the day before the 2008 Oscars. TOO BAD the films did not get more nominations.",9,0,1,23 February 2008
Jaws," A true classic film
","Where the summer blockbuster came from.I was a kid when this first came out.I was not allowed to see it until I got a little older.Enjoyed it from the 1st moment I saw it.Perfect music, John Williams well deserved his Oscar for this.Cast perfect.Drama perfect, terror was done perfectly by Spielberg.Just because of all the problems they had filming they turned out a true classic film.Saw all 3 of the sequels, only 1 I liked was the 2cd one.SHOULD have won Best Picture!!",9,1,3,22 February 2006
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The true classic
",What can you say about this film that has not been said already.The original. A true classic film.Still as beautiful to look at today.Wonderful music. 'The Silly Song' is my favorite.Great characters. Dwarfs. Dopey & Grumpy are my favorites.The Evil Queen is my 2cd favorite Disney Villain behind Maleficent.I prefer the Evil Queen to her alter ego the Old Hag.'Heigh Ho'.Voices for the characters were perfect. Too bad now most everyone who worked on the film has passed on.Films are NOT made of this quality anymore. Way too bad.'I'm Wishing'.,10,3,4,3 March 2006
WALL·E," A charming Disney/Pixar film
","I found this to be a charming filmI liked the Wall-E & Eve charactersIf you do NOT like messages you may not like the environmental one used hereGood to see real actors in a Disney/Pixar film for a change. Only 1 of note is Fred Willard He did his job but they could have tried to have gotten a bigger named actor for the small partMusic was OK Nothing bad about it but it did not jump out at you Older songs used so I doubt the film will get an Oscar nomination for the scoreI caught The Little Mermaid reference-Wall-E keeping all the interesting items he finds to Ariel's collectionGreat looking animationNOW, A BIG POINT OF WHO THOUGHT THIS UP?The DVD package. Instead of a useable to store or stack plastic DVD package we get this thin card board, 1 side you get out disc 1, the other side you pull out the other 2 discs NOT ANY PRINTED INFORMATION ON THE FILM, no brochure or anything I am very upset about this package FOR THE EXPENSIVE PRICE BUYERS DESERVE SOMETHING BETTER Way too high priced REVIEW AFTER WATCHING 3 DISC DVD PACKAGE",8,0,3,19 November 2008
Blade Runner," Film still has an impact 25 years later AFTER 2007 DVD RELEASE
","I was first in the door opening day when it opened June 1982.Film SHOULD have done better at the box office.Still visually stunning.Film had faults & even in this 'final edition' it still does.The voice over, a lot has been said about it. Harrison did should bored when he did it. When you see the film now without it you can truly say it was never needed.The unnecessary Joanna Cassidy topless scene, never liked that. VERY disappointed in editing now a days the film makers could NOT correct the problem with the stunt double with the BLACK wig in for Joanna with RED hair as Zhora is put into retirement.Good to see interviews with most of the remaining cast.It claims to be the 'final cut'. Yeah, we will wait & see on that.And, the DVD package of course did NOT get a chapter search list.",8,1,5,23 December 2007
Aladdin," A totally fun film.
",You can never tire of watching this film.Robin William's Genie character is near if not at the very top of my 'Favorite Disney Character' list.Fun. Beautiful to look at. Great music. Perfect characters. Jafar is my favorite MALE Disney villain. Evil but makes a fool of himself as well. Great voice cast for Jafar as well.Too bad the Best Animated Film Oscar category was not around at this time. Yet another Oscar Disney WOULD HAVE WON HANDS DOWN.9 lines now. 10 lines now.,9,2,3,21 February 2006
Cinderella Man," Russell & Ron do it again-great film but...........
","As a fan of Russell?s for over 7 years now I was really looking forward to this film. I was NOT disappointed. Great film, he & Ron Howard did great jobs.WHAT I AM VERY UPSET ABOUT: As a film & DVD fan I would have preferred to purchase the collectors DVD set for the film but I could not, so I had to settle for this version of the film.When I opened up the package, expecting to find the sheet with the chapter stops listed, bonus features, information about the film, what did I find instead? AN OPEN UP, 4 PAGE ADVERTISEMENT FOR KODAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!MY WORD!!!!!!!!!!!! WHO MADE THE DECISION TO PUT THIS IN THE DVD PACKAGE INSTEAD OF INFORMATION ON THE FILM OR THE DVD?The makers of this DVD package should be ashamed of themselves for putting this film out in this condition.If I want information about Kodak or it?s products A DVD PACKAGE FOR A FILM IS NOT WHERE I WANT TO FIND IT!!!!!!Bad job Universal & Kodak!!!!!!!",8,0,1,9 December 2005

Most enjoyed those scenes.'Welcome to Jurassic Park'.Of course, love the Universal Studios Hollywood ride this was based on. REMEMBER, THEY THOUGHT OF THE RIDE ALONG WITH THE FILM.The best of the 3 films so far.Course, the famous error in the script about Disneyland opening in 1956, not the correct 1955.",9,3,4,28 February 2006
The Simpsons Movie," Enjoyed the movie-boring DVD package
","As a Simpson?s fan since the show premiered December 1989 (I have never seen all the Tracy Ulman episodes) And, yes I did spell her last name wrong. Sorry Enjoyed the film-several real funny scenes. Rock & A Hard Place, ads. ?Excellent?.Now, for the lame DVD package.What is the deal with that THIN paper insert that tears because it is on SO THIN paper. MOSTLY ads & NO CHAPTER LIST.Guess this is supposed to keep Simpson?s fans happy until the 11 season is released on DVD.NOT a heck of a lot of info on the DVD package.Just plain boring extras or LACK or badly designed extras.Obviously based on viewing the film on DVD review.",8,1,3,18 December 2007
