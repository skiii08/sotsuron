Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Outstanding!
","SW1 is the first movie in more than 20 years that I have gone to see in the theaters more than once.  It is outstanding.  Tremendous special effects, great characters and wonderful martial arts scenes with the light sabers. I was quite sorry to see Liam Neeson's character of Qui Gon get killed - I really thought he did an awesome job.  And Ewan MacGregor was absolutely perfect for the younger Obi-Wan.  With a little imagination, you can visualize him aging into Alec Guiness!I'm going to go again this weekend!",10,0,0,23 July 1999
Erin Brockovich," I liked it - great writing, great acting.
","Oh, gawds, another chickflick.  Ok, honey, we'll go see it.Boy, was I ever wrong.  Great script that two veterans really sank their teeth into.  I'd read the reviews and actually seen the interview with the real Erin, but even then, I wasn't prepared for the impact.Ms. Roberts is outstanding and Mr. Finney is superb.  The two play off each other like they have been doing it for years.  I think this will be an Oscar nomination next year.  And if Julia Roberts doesn't win Best Actress, she'll definitely win Best Supported Actress!",Null,1,1,27 March 2000
Unbreakable," Shyamalan and Willis: Batman and Robin?
","Are we seeing the emergence of a dynamic duo here?In 'Unbreakable', we have another Shyamalan work that seems to have a family tree that traces back to Twilight Zone, Thriller, Night Gallery and The Outer Limits.  It's a solid piece that does have a good twist at the end; not as compelling as the twist in 'Sixth Sense', but it will grab you nontheless.Bruce Willis seems to respond quite well to Shyamalan's direction.  The two have a harmony that means we, the paying audience, get our money's worth and a whole lot more.",10,1,1,27 November 2000
Star Trek," This movie reeked. Save your money and don't go.
","Okay, I'll admit it. I'm a Trekker. This franchise has been around for 40+ years and has been very successful until now. This movie flushed the whole thing down the toilet.I'll give credit - they did a great job of finding people that look like younger versions of Kirk, Spock, McCoy et al. And there are some funny lines.But for the love of Pete....Vulcan is destroyed? Spock is shagging Uhuru? Gimme a break, already. You just don't jump in and rewrite canon on a series like this. It might have worked once they announced the time travel thing, if they had 'reset' the universe at the end of the movie. But they didn't.Do you feel that rumbling noise under your feet? That's Gene Roddenberry turning over in his grave over what has been done to Star Trek. He's up to about 200 rpm, feels like.",1,171,264,9 May 2009
The Hunger Games," Thumbs-down on shaky-cam
","Directors who film using shaky-cam should be taken out and publicly horsewhipped. There is a reason steady-cam was invented, you morons!! I would have given this movie a 10 if it weren't for the fact that I couldn't watch half of it. I had to look at the back of the seat in front of me during the shaky-cam scenes, and of course, those were the best ones. As far as I could tell from what I could watch and from the dialog, the movie is quite true to the novel and the acting is very good. The scenery is quite lovely, as well - turns out it was shot in North Carolina, which means that's Appalachian country.Did I mention the director should be flogged for using shaky-cam?",10,4,10,23 April 2012
Ocean's Twelve," Waste of time
","Sorry, folks.This may have been an all-star cast and all that stuff, but the movie just wasn't that good. Lame plot and bad acting. In addition, they did not use a steadicam on several of the scenes and if you are susceptible to motion sickness, you're gonna have a bad time.Even the little twist of having Julia Roberts play a character playing the role of Julia Roberts couldn't save this dog. It was cute enough that I gave the film a 3 instead of a 1, but it is the only saving grace and they ran it into the ground quickly enough. Bruce Willis might as well have been seeing dead folks in this film, too.",3,5,8,11 December 2004
Alien," Outstanding horror film
","I went back and saw Alien on video again last weekend.  Must be about the 50th time I've seen it.  I know where all the scary scenes are, and it still ties my intestines in a knot.  This movie is a classic.  Everthing is classic - the lighting, the sets, the music.  And the outstanding job of acting by all concerned really is what makes the movie click.The subsequent stories in the Alien saga are cheap rip-offs; Hollywood follows the traditional line of 'If we had one thing that was good, let's clone the hell out of it and make a few more bucks.'",10,0,1,9 August 1999
The Polar Express," A great Xmas movie
","Every once in a while, we have a good Xmas movie come along. The latest ones have been 'The Santa Clause' and 'Santa Clause II'; now we have 'Polar Express'.After we got back home from the show, we dug out the book. What amazed me was how hard the movie's animators worked to stay true to the drawings in the book (the whole book itself takes about 2 minutes to read). The writers took some liberties with the journey getting to the Pole, but all-in-all, this is an Xmas movie that will stand the test of time. Throw away 'It's A Wonderful Life' and replace it with 'Polar Express'.",10,3,7,11 December 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," disappointing
","It's almost a maxim that the more a movie gets hyped, the worse it will be. Episode II comes close to falling into that category.Everyone says Jar-Jar Binks must die.Not Jar-Jar, but that little twit, Hayden Christensen, that played Ani.If my teenage daughter's reaction to him is typical, they cast him as a heart throb only.  They sure didn't get him for his acting abilities.Episode II wasn't anywhere near as good as Episode I, although seeing Ms. Portman in her white jump suit was worth the admission.",6,0,0,27 May 2002
The Bourne Ultimatum," I would really have liked to watch this movie
","Great cast, based on a great story. Good action, good martial arts, lots of suspense. Sounds like a winner. I got up and walked out after about 15 minutes.Why? The idiot director filmed the movie hand-held instead of steady-cam. The immediate result is motion sickness for a large number of people, including me. So I got the pleasure of spending $8.00 for a ticket, another $9.00 for a Coke and popcorn and another $5.00 in change on the video games in the lobby waiting for my wife to come out and tell me about it.Hollywood needs to announce long and loud whether a movie is shot hand-held. That way, we don't waste our money on it.",1,7,13,13 September 2007
Notting Hill," I really enjoyed this film.
","Wonderful movie!  I went into it not expecting much.  I'm not a big Julia fan, but she really did a great job.  Hugh Grant was also outstanding, but the scene stealer was the comic relief - Rhys Ifans as the 'masturbating Welshman' roommate was absolutely hilarious.Go see this movie!",9,0,0,23 July 1999
Cast Away," How does he keep doing it?
","Tom Hanks has done it again.  He's got another movie that allows him to pull out the stops and show us what a true star can do with a good story.Hollywood pours out schlock by the barrel, but not this time.  'Cast Away' is destined to become one with classics like 'Casablanca', 'Gone With The Wind', etc. - the kind of movie that when you say the title, it just sends a chill up your spine, it's so good.Go see this movie several times.  I've already seen it three times and each time, there's something new that you didn't see the previous times.And say a prayer for poor Wilson, would you?",10,0,0,27 December 2000
The Alamo," Enough history gotten right to really make the errors stand out
","The Alamo is a reasonably entertaining movie.  There's good acting throughout and the final battle scene is really mesmerizing.Having said that, I now need to post a spoiler alert.
They played fast and loose with a lot of the facts, and left out one of the most moving moments of the entire Alamo saga.  For whatever reason, the makers of this film seemed to have a real dislike for David Crockett. They continually downplayed his character throughout the movie, making him appear nothing more than a opportunistic, greedy buffoon.  The ending of the movie showed Crockett being captured and brought before Santa Anna - total horsecrap.  Crockett was killed in the fighting; his body was observed by one of the few survivors (Susanna Dickinson) as she was brought out of the Alamo.  In addition, one of the slaves (Ben) also identified his body.And they totally omitted the line in the sand incident.  Travis spoke to the men and gave them an update on what was happening.  He then drew a line in the sand and gave the men the opportunity to stay and fight by crossing the line, or to attempt to leave.  Moses Rose was the only one who chose not to cross the line; he escaped later that night.If you're willing to overlook several glaring factual errors, you'll like the movie.  It saddens me to think, though, that many people will see it and believe it is historically accurate.  If Hollywood is going to make a film about an historical event, they should either do it right or not do it at all.",Null,1,2,12 April 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," No problemo!
",Tremendous special effects.  This was the movie that pioneered morphing and seeing the T-1000 bounce (or slither) back from everything that gets thrown at it is awesome.Arnold's throwaway line: 'I need a vacation.' is one of the high points of the show.  It comes at just the right time.,10,2,2,20 March 1999
Hardball," PG-13? Not hardly!
","Lame opening, strong ending.  But a PG-13?  No way.  This movie should have been rated R for language and violence, which shows how totally bogus the rating system really is.  It appears some big bucks got laid out so that this movie would appear palatable to parents with young kids.",7,0,2,29 October 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," great from all aspects
","As a martial artist, I appreciate well-executed technique.  Even the worst acted chop-socky movie is okay with me if the martial arts skills are present.That's not the case here.  This movie has excellent acting, excellent directing, sets, costumes, etc. in addition to terrific martial arts skills. It's a winner from all points of view.  They can be forgiven the hokey flying scenes and running over the surface of a lake because of the strength of the movie overall.",10,0,0,24 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," better and better...
",I thought Fellowship of the Ring was outstanding.  The Two Towers just blows it away.  I'm not terribly sure I'll be able to survive The Return of the King when it comes out.  All I can say is Waaaahhhh - I gotta wait a year :-(,10,0,0,22 December 2002
Hero," A very good movie except for the wirework
","Hero is a classic Chinese drama/tragedy. Comparisons to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will be made, but the two movies are very different. The cinematography in Hero was better and the tale is told in mostly flashback as opposed to 'realtime' in CTHD.I must admit, though, that I think the wire work detracts horribly from the grace and beauty of the martial arts scenes. I really don't know why Chinese directors are so enamored by it, and unfortunately American directors are becoming more enamored with it, too. And to be bluntly honest, this movie could have used at least one unarmed combat scene, instead of being all weapons.",9,0,0,6 September 2004
Patton," Outstanding work by George Scott
","The best comment on this film was made by my father.  This was the last movie he saw in a theater.  He had served under Patton in WW2 and said that Scott had nailed Patton's character and mannerisms so perfectly that halfway through the opening speech, he expected Scott/Patton to look down and say, '$@%#$@, Sears, get a haircut - your hair's too &#%#$%@ long!'",10,151,182,20 March 1999
The Illusionist," Sleeper movie for 2006
","The Illusionist is definitely a sleeper.The only weakness is the plot, but with a little imagination, one can make it work. I found it a little hard to believe that a few forbidden snogging sessions at age 14 or so would result in a monumental true love that would last through the ages. But once the movie got past that, it was quite easy to overlook.The magic is excellent, by the way. The traditional stage illusions are well done and the special effect illusions are not big and overpowering; they add to the overall depth, not detract from it.The final illusion is very, very well thought out and very well executed. Excellent acting from Norton, Biel, Giamatti, and Sewell just oozes malice as the bad guy. You have to fight to restrain yourself from throwing your popcorn at him.This movie should grab some Oscars. Highly recommended.",10,4,5,5 September 2006
Rules of Engagement," I enjoyed it
","Good movie.  Well acted, well directed.  It's probably not Academy Award material but I enjoyed both Jones' and Jackson's performances.  The movie really makes you think about the problems facing today's military with the weasels we have in public office.  Well worth the admission price.",8,1,3,24 May 2000
8 Mile," Why isn't this movie #1 on the bottom 100 list?
","A friend gave me tickets to it.  I lasted about 15 minutes or so, then walked out feeling like I was ready to blow chunks all over the lobby.I'm sad to say that I have seen a LOT of the movies on the Bottom 100 list. They are all superb examples of filmmaking compared to this piece of trash.",1,9,32,11 February 2004
Mission: Impossible II," Waste of time and money
","I was reluctant to see this show after being so incredibly disappointed by MI-1.  I should have listened to my inner voice that kept saying, 'Don't go, don't go.'Big budget blow-em-up, lousy acting, lousy plot.  I rated it a 3 instead of lower because there are some very nice shots of mountains, etc. and a great but oh-gods-way-too-short appearance by Hannibal Lecter, er..uh..Anthony Hopkins.Don't waste your time and money seeing this.  I'm sorry I did.",3,0,0,12 June 2000
Big Fish," I have not been affected this much by a movie in a long time
","I think any guy who has unresolved father issues is going to be affected by this movie.  Normally, when we go see a movie like this, I grab some extra napkins because my VSO will get puddle-eyed.  She did, but I wound up crying like a baby at the ending and using up all the napkins.This is an absolutely wonderful movie.  Ewan McGregor has really developed into a fine actor and performances like this will insure that he does not get typecast as Obi-Wan Kenobi.  And I had never seen Matthew McGrory in a movie before.  He is a good actor; you really get into his character as the giant.Go see this movie, several times.  I'll be the guy in the 10th row sniffling and sobbing.",10,0,0,22 January 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," WARNING - Be careful with this movie
","What I was able to see of this movie was good.  It's a good story, good plot, good acting. BIG WARNING HERE: If you are susceptible to motion sickness, do NOT try to watch this movie. It's filmed mostly handheld, not steadycam, and the constant jiggling of the camera nearly made me barf.  I had to leave the movie about halfway through and find out from my family what happened in the second half.
Needless to say, that was rather disappointing.  I had the same problem with Saving Private Ryan.  I'm going to try to rent Eternal Sunshine and watch it when it comes out on DVD; I was able to handle Private Ryan on the small screen and I'm hoping I'll be able to handle this one as well.",7,0,1,26 March 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Excellent job by Russell and Jennifer
","Oscar performances here, folks.Russell Crowe's portrayal of a man blessed by brilliance and cursed by schizophrenia is absolutely fantastic.  And Jennifer Connelly's performance as the woman who comes to love and marry him, and stand by him during his illness, is also fantastic.  Both of these talented actors have really reached down inside and pulled something extra out for this movie and I think both of them are going to get Oscars for their work.  If they don't, shame on Hollywood.",10,0,1,23 January 2002
The Green Mile," Tom Hanks has done it again!
","Tom Hanks has gotten another great script and done another outstanding job. His performance as Boss Paul made me go out and get the novel by King. Incidentally, this is one of the rare occasions where Hollywood did not screw up an excellent novel - they were quite true to King's quite gripping story.This is a compelling moral dilemma.  The guards have to obey the law and execute John Coffey, but as they wait for his time to walk the Green Mile, they find that John possesses a miraculous gift.  I found myself asking 'What would I do?'What would you do?",10,0,1,20 January 2000
The Good Shepherd," Sucks pondwater
","A much ballyooed movie, but The Good Shepherd's hoo falls far short of its bally.Give the cast and the fact that 'Robert De Niro, had been working on this film for ten years as his 'pet project.', I really expected something good. Instead, I got 3+ hours of long-winded, bad, boring script mixed with bad acting performances. De Niro should have spent his time in a more constructive manner.Save your time and money, folks. This movie is a dog. But if you do decide to go, sit way up high in the corner where your snoring won't bother the folks around you. Well, it probably won't, because they'll be snoring, too.",1,13,28,27 December 2006
Shrek," funny than I thought possible
","In a nutshell - this is quite likely the funnies movie I have seen in the last 5 years.  I laughed so hard I hurt.Be warned that if you are depressed when you go in, you sure won't be when you come out.  And beware of the scene with the princess and the bird; don't be drinking a coke when it comes on or you'll baptize the people in front of you.",10,1,2,15 June 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," Suspenseful doesn't come close!
","Great job by Foster and Hopkins.  Hannibal's part could have been fleshed out a little more, though (sorry, couldn't resist that one).  The book described him in more detail and made him even more reprehensible; the movie could have spent five minutes more and done the same.",10,1,1,20 March 1999
Bruce Almighty," Mrogan Freeman makes this movie (minor spoiler included)
","Jim is the main character, yes, and he does a great job.  He has a flair for comedy and good timing.  But IMNSHO, Morgan Freeman walks away with this one.  He had a tough pair of shoes to fill as God; he's not a 90 year old white guy that smokes cigars  :-)   But he does a great job.  Let's put it this way.  If I thought that there was a God who had a sense of humor and would pull off a stunt like telling someone he's dead, then smiling and saying, 'Nah, I'm just messin' wid ya' - I'd be willing to believe in him.",9,0,2,20 July 2003
The Sixth Sense," One of the best suspense movies I have ever seen.
","I made the mistake of listening to critics who said that Bruce Willis' performance wasn't very good.  I thought that he and Haley Osment were terrific together, and Toni Collette's performance as the mother trying to hold everything together is dynamite.  This movie is *definitely* Oscar material.  Just enough 'spooky' stuff to keep you on the edge of the seat, combined with outstanding performances and a tremendous ending - IMHO, Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud to have directed this if he were still around.  I'm going back again tonight.",10,0,0,9 August 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Non-stop action and adventure
","The best, by far, of the Indiana Jones series.  The interaction between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford is dynamite.  I'm really sorry that no more Indys were made, but they sure went out with a winner on this one!",10,0,0,20 March 1999
The Bourne Supremacy," terrible photography
","I rated this film a 5 and that's being generous.  It's some of the worst photography I've ever seen.  I got horribly motion sick about 20 minutes into the show because of the lousy camera work, and finally had to get up and leave before I barfed.There's a reason SteadiCams were invented.  Haldheld photography like this - well, all I can say is that I've seen home movies made by ten year olds that were better filmed than this show.And let's not even think about getting into the issue of a movie having the title and character names from a popular novel, but bearing absolutely no resemblence to the novel.  Let's just not go there.Save your money on this one, folks.",5,0,1,23 July 2004
13 Hours," I'm pretty sure this was an excellent movie
","The soundtrack and the dialog sounded great. At least the part that I heard did. However, it's filmed with shaky-cam and as a result, I had to leave the movie halfway through because I was getting so motion sick that I was about to barf. This is why I only gave it 7 stars instead of 10. Movies like this need a warning. I'm really tired of wasting big bucks on a ticket for a show I can't watch.Having said that - what I was able to sit through was outstanding. Good acting, good dialog, and great attention to detail. And it really makes you ask: who was responsible for hanging those people out to dry and getting Ambassador Stevens killed? And why is that person not in prison today?",7,5,12,23 January 2016
