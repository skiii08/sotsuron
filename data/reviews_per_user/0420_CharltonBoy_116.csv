The Blair Witch Project," It's what being Scared is all about!
","Have you ever gone camping and woken up in the middle of the night so scared because you think someone is outside your tent or have you ever woken up from a nightmare so bad that you didn't want to go back to sleep? well this sums up The Blair Witch Project perfectly exept multiply the terror ten fold. This is supposed to be a film made on a portable hand held camera by three students who set out to find out more about the story of the Blair Witch.Because it looks and feels so real the film is incredibly scary , you end up forgeting that it is a movie and start to believe it is  real footage.For me this film makes the Exorsist look like Scooby Doo!Wonderfull stuff. 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,6 May 2000
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Quite Shallow ,but i liked it.
",This film seems to lack any sort of substance and all the story is about is basically 72 holes of golf and a sort of love affair. The acting is good and and we get the usual teary performance from Charleze Theron.It may seem that i havent got to much good to say about the film but i couldn't help but like it and i found it highly watchable.The continuity is really poor when the golf shots are shown especially the real howler on the last hole from Walter Hagen when his shot to the green landed 10 foot away yet he putted from only a foot from the hole!. 7 out of 10,7,1,3,5 July 2003
Antz," Very good animated adventure.
","Without going into how good the animation is and the Computer graphics the thing that really stands out in this film is how the famous actors who do the voices really fit the characters. The ants that have the voices done by Sylvester Stalone,Christopher Walken ,Woody Allen and Gene Hackman are so well animated they have the same manorisms as the actors themselves. I wouldnt say the film is quite as good as Toy story or Chicken run but in the Kids movie stakes this rates as one of the best. Also check out what the dung beetles have to say, it's really funny! 8 out of 10",8,0,1,14 January 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I cant wait for the next one.
","The Phantom Menace was a better movie than i was expecting. I had read the reviews and spoken to people who had seen it and i was under the impression that it was not very good but i loved it! The Story is really about how Darth Vader( anakin Skywalker) was found and started the path to being a Jedi . any other story in this film is really irelivant and is just a vehicle to show of some stunning special affects.However there are some annoying things about the film one being it starts too quickly without building into a climax( some would say that was a good thing) and the other is the accents!.Jar jar binxs has a incomprehendable West Indian accent as does his fellow race , which is really irritating and Ewan Mcgregor's impression of Sir Alec Guiness is just Plain bad. But if you can put up with that you should enjoy it. 8 out of 10.",8,0,2,17 April 2000
Ali," The Greatest deserved better.
","Let me start by saying Ali is a good film, not a great film , but a good film , which for me a big let down. I expected a great film and the worlds most famous sportsman deserved a great film. Everything was there , in place , for a fantastic movie. Will Smith , who is brilliant as Ali, the photography is fantastic and the funding was there , so why didnt this film live up to it's billing? In my opinion there are a couple of reasons . 1. Why didnt we see the Life story of Ali ? What we did see was how he was recruted by the Evil nation of Islam and how he refused to go to war and the notorious Rumble in the Jungle , then is finished!! Hang on , what about how he won his title back for a third time or the battle with Parkinson's desease? 2.The Second half of the film was so realistic in it's portrayal of the Rumble in the Jungle it look exactly like the film ' When We Were Kings' which although real footage in that film , we had seen it not long before. As i said this is still a good film and the fight scenes are the best i have ever seen in a movie but it still wasnt good enough. 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,14 July 2002
Catch Me If You Can," Enjoyable but too long.
",Catch me if you can is an enjoyable film that has a certain something that you cant put your finger on.Perhaps it is the DeCaprio charm or maybe it is the Tom Hanks factor that makes this very watchable but dont be fooled into thinking this is as good as everbody says because it does have one very poor floor.The problem with Catch Me If You Can is that it is one of those film that starts at the end then goes back to the begining and keeps switching to the end again and this really spoils the movie. We dont want to know what happens at the start we want to find out at the end!Only films like Momento can pull this off and this is no Momento. The acting is good and i would say the best display is from Christopher Walken and we should see more from this highly underrated actor. All in all not a bad film but it could have had 20 minutes shaved off of it. 7 out of 10.,7,0,1,11 July 2003
Minority Report," Brilliant state of the art thriller.
","Some would say Speilberg made a bit of a Turkey with A.I , a film that i havent seen but i have seen Minority Report and having sat through over 2 hours of sheer entertainment and mind blowing sci fi brilliance the worlds most famous director does not have to worry about this being a flop.Tom Cruise is perfect in the role of Pre crime Detective John Anderton although he does not have to put in a brilliant performance because the story and the special affects make this a gripping and highly watchable thriller that has twists and turns that any giant Roller Coaster would be proud of. Some film are so hyped up that when you actually go and see the film you leave dissappointed , with Monority Report BELIEVE THE HYPE!! 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,6 July 2002
G.I. Jane," Entertaining chic flic
","G.I.Jane was better than I was expecting. Demi Moore plays a female officer who is trying to become a Navy SEAL and has to battle against the odds against tha sexism, politics amd physical toughness to make the grade. Although totaly predictable in every way I quite enjoyed it.",7,24,50,15 September 1999
Training Day," Films dont get any better than this. 10 out of 10
","I have been so looking forward to watching Taining Day because of the accolades that it has recieved both about the film and the acting and having watched it they are fully justified. I would go as far to say that this is the best cop movie i have ever seen. The story is fairly simple it is about a rookie who is on his first day on the department and unluckily has Denzil Washington as his boss who is a corrupt cop. Thw acting is as good as acting can get. Denzil Washington is fantastic and quite rightly recieved an oscar nomination but Ethan Hawke deserves compliments too. this is by far his best acting roll and quite frankly things can't get any better. The film is shot in L.A which makes it look realistic and that is thanks to brilliant direction from an director i had never heard , Antione Fuqua. look out for him in the future because he has created a masterpiece here in Training day. 10 out of 10.",10,2,13,13 December 2002
Monty Python's Life of Brian," The Funniest Comedy film ever made!
","Monty Python's Life Of Brian is without a shadow of a doubt the Funniest film ever made and there is a arguement that this could also be the greatest film ever , comedy or not. When this was released back in 1979 this film upset many liberal religious freaks because they thought it was about the story of Christ when any fan of this film will tell you it is about Brian and not Christ. The problem being that most people who let their life be ruled by religion are so narrow minded that they never bothered to watch the film but just judged it anyway......Morons. Some of the one liners and Sketches in the movie are some of the most memorable in cinematic history and repeated by Python fans throughout the world and quite rightly so. I cannot forsee a film ever being made that came come close to this and that just the way it should be. Any film that upsets the religious bigots is ok by me. 10 OUT OF 10",10,2,6,9 December 2001
Erin Brockovich," Julia Robert's best display by far.
","I must admit i wasnt too keen on watching Erin Brokovich for a couple of reasons.One is that i am not too keen Julia Roberts or more to the point the type of film she stars in I.E Pretty Woman the other reason is that i presumed that this film was mainly for women. I was wrong. This is film would appeal to everybody. It has charm, humour and a very good story and the acting from all quarters is top notch. Julia Roberts also looks superb, she has the best legs in Hollywood !. I'm not sure how true to life her character is but i would love to see if the real Erin Brokovich is as up front and speaks her mind as much as the one in the film. 8 out of 10.",8,5,8,3 February 2002
Meet the Parents," The funniest Gay Focker i have ever seen!
",Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro come up trumps with this very funny movie about a male nurse who wants to marry his girlfriend but finds out he needs to get her fathers permission. They go to her parents house and that is where the fun starts. Robert De Nero is definately getting a lot better at comedy and in this he is very funny as an ex CIA over protective father. There are many funny scenes in this film including the Cat and the Urn sketch and the airport scenes and Ben Stiller carries them off to perfection. Very enjoyable. 8 out of 10.,8,0,0,4 March 2001
Se7en," Superb Thriller with a brilliant ending
","Se7en , in my opinion is one of the best cop movies ever made if not THE best. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman try to track down a vicious serial killer who murders using the seven deadly sins. A great storyline and fantastic ending( very un Hollywood!). There has only been one movie that has had a better ending than this and that is Monty Pythons Life of Brian. If you havent seen Se7en before you Must watch it! 10 out of 10",10,0,0,8 January 2000
Unbreakable," 'I see bad people'
","Let me start by saying if on the DVD or Video it says  'This is a follow up to The Sixth Sense' take no notice. While this film does have the same feel it is by no means a follow up. Unbreakable is in some ways better the the sixth sense because it really does make you think all the way through the film as to what is happening. Bruce Willis plays security guard ,David Dunn,who is the only survivor in a train crash and is reminded by Elijah Price played by Samuel L Jackson that maybe there is more to his survival that meets the eye. If you are expecting an all action movie forget it because it is not what this film is about. If you are in to comic books you will love this although it is not a requirement . Like the sixth sence this has a twist that is unexpected and without saying what it is it IS good! Sit back and enjoy. 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,1 September 2001
Fight Club," I could quite happily die than watch this rubbish again!
","Have you ever had flu or food poisening and have been laid up in bed with a fever? you know the feeling, you loose all track of time , you are not sure if you have slept and your dreams drift in to real life. Have you ever been so drunk that you wish you were dead, the feeling is the worst in the world isnt it.? Watching the Fight Club is all these feelings rolled into one. i can honestly say this is nearly the worst film i have ever seen. i wont try to go into what the film is about because i could not tell you. This film last 16 hours ..or so it feels. Looking at the box it says 133 minutes. i would rather have spent 133 minutes sticking pins under my finger nails. What complete rubbish. Please don't watch it. 1 out of 10.",1,11,34,21 May 2000
Memento," A Brilliant,unique movie.
",Momento is like no other movie i have ever seen or am likely to ever see. This a film that that is fairly easy to describe the outline of the plot but almost impossible to describe the story. Guy Pierce plays an insurance investigator who suffers from short term memory loss after a bash on the head during the murder of his wife. this means that he can't retain any memories for more than 5 minutes although he can remember eveything before the accident. With this affliction he tries to find the killer of his wife to inflict revenge. The way the film plays out is quite brilliant. It has little pattern yet it is so watchable simply because all the time you are trying to work out what it going. It is like the viewer has the same term memory loss as the main character.While it is almost impossible to know where you are in the story it is not irritating in the way some films can be when the story is to complicated. Guy Pierce is superb and pulls this off to perfection.But i think a big congratulation goes to Christopher and Jonathon Nolan for the brilliant direction and writing. 9 out of 10.,10,0,2,20 November 2001
Amistad," Another fantastic film from Spielberg.
","Amistad is one of them films that when the credits roll you just sit there and think what a wonderfull film that was ,what a well directed and well acted movie i have just seen. The acting is some of the best i have ever seen. the performances from Mathew McConaughue,Pete Postlethwaite and Morgan Freeman are Brilliant but check out the acting from Anthony Hopkins and Djimon Hounson,they are superb. The story is gripping and moving at the same time. The scenes on the Amistad ship are quite distressing and really show you how repulsive the slave trade was but this just adds to the realism and wonder of this fantastic film. A masterpeice. 9 out of 10.",9,41,58,3 July 2000
The 13th Warrior," A rare but good Viking movie.
","I was thinking while watching this movie, why are there hardly any viking movies made? There is a good recipe for an action movie with Vikings what with the fighting,raping and pilliging and the 13th Warrior is a good action movie, although the Vikings are the good guys in this. Antonio Banderes plays an arab who is picked to fight as a warrior against an unknown race of people who attacked a village of Vikings. This has the feel of the Seventh Samarai of the Magnifiscent Seven ,the few oppressed against the many. While this film has nothing it it to make it a brilliant film it is very watchable and i would advise you to watch this if you are into war/action/adventure movies. 7 out of 10.",7,62,80,6 May 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Great old fashioned action movie
","Although Pirates of the Caribbean is not a film likely to win acadamy awards this is a film that you really cant find fault with. The story is fairly simple , a little like a fairy tale , which gives it charm.The cast is magnifiscent. Jeffrey Rush is superb as the baddie as is Johnny Depp as the comic hero. What is good to see is that he seems to have mastered the English accent unlike in the film 'From Hell'and he is charming with it. This film reminds me a little of Jason and The Argonaults but with more humour and recommend if you have not seen it do so. 8 out of 10.",8,0,2,18 March 2004
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Mildly Funny in parts.
","Firstly i will say that that i am not a fan of South Park and i hardly ever watch the TV series so maybe i am a little cinical anyway but, and i know it's been said many times before, but the animation is so bad it really spoils the film. Some of the humour is funny,even though it is a bit childish. Having said that i would not want any child of mine to see this because it is as near the knuckle as you can get. An example is the main song in the film is called ' Shut your F*****g face uncle F****r and a very catchy number it is too!Also the song sung by the teacher is very funny. The trouble is that after a very good first half hour it get really stupid. it is almost as if they used up their best jokes and songs for the begining and used the unfunny stuff for the remainder of the movie. At the end of the day after watching this i still wont bother watching the TV series. 6 out of 10.",6,0,2,22 February 2002
Elizabeth," Virgin on the great!
",Elizebeth is a compelling if somewhat slow at times movie that has some superb acting and wonderfull costumes and scenery. It took me half an hour to get into but once i knew where everyone was coming from and who was stabbing who in the back i enjoyed it. I would not rate it as high as some people have on the comments pages but i would recomend it.7 out of 10,7,0,0,21 November 1999
Blade," Superb action movie
","Well what a film! Blade is one hell of a good action/horror movie. Weslie Snipes is great as Blade the vampire slayer. This movie has some amazing special affects and i bet you have never seen so much blood in two hours. Your in for a treat here ,sit back and enjoy.  8 out of 10",8,0,1,2 November 1999
The Mummy," I Want my Mummy!
","The Mummy is a typical Universal Studios Movie. It is entertaining , crammed with special affects and all too predictable.I did enjoy this movie for what it was , an action comic book adventure . It is far from a horror movie , which is what the old Mummy movies were.The main problem i have with this film is the trailers for it . once you have seen them you have seen the best special affect the film has to offer. I would still recomend it for the kids and most adults. 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,6 February 2000
The Others," Like a modern day Hammer House of Horror.
","The Others is an above average horror that does not rely on Gore or American College kids being slashed to death but more on a good story and some very good acting.From very early on in the film you tend to know that something isnt quite right and there is going to be a twist at the end and you dont have to be a genius to work out whats happening.That does not take away from what is a good film that for me is spooky enough for the avid horror fan and the highlight of the film is the brilliant performance from all the cast from the child actors, Nicole Kidman and the brilliant Eric Sykes in the first straight roll i have seen him in. Well worth watching but i am a little suprised it made the IMDB top 250. 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,16 May 2003
Chicken Run," Superb entertainment.
","Chicken Run is a brilliant example of figure animation, in fact the best example you will ever see. The makers Peter Lord and Nick Park deserve another oscar( they already have two!)for this because this is just superb. The story revolves around a group of chickens who are trying to escape from a farm lead by a dopy farmer and his overbearing wife. If the Chickens do not produce eggs they are for the chop! Then along comes a circus performing rooster who misleads the chickens into believing that he can fly hence raising their hopes of an escape. This is all set around the theme of the 1960's film 'The Great Escape'.It is an adventure, a comedy and a love story all in one and the most amazing thing is they are all plasticine figures!! Mel Gibson,Jane Horrocks and Phil Daniels are just some of the stars who provide the voices. 9 out of 10.",9,1,1,8 December 2000
Insomnia," Mesmerising performance from Pacino
",I used to think that nobody could come close to Robert De Niro when it comes to who was the best actor in Hollywood but as the years went by he started to pick some real Turkeys and a in the mean while an old hand was gradually taking the crown from De Niro and that is Al Pacino. In Insomnia he has picked another cracker of a film that although not fast paced is brilliantly acted and is very watchable. Hilary Swank is superb as is Robin Williams and its refreshing to see him taking a serious role instead of sentimental trash like Patch Adams but as per usual it is Al Pacino who steals the show. He plays an insomniac Cop who gets intangled in a murder case and gets into trouble after accidently killing his partner . I cant think of an actor who looks more tired than Pacino anyway so he was perfect for the role. The story is OK but to be honest the film is more about the performances than the plot. 8 out of 10,8,77,97,5 March 2003
X-Men," X Men = Mystery men without the comedy.
",X Men reminded me so much of Mystery men but without the comedy ! This is no critisism because both film are good and have there own merits. X Men is about the struggle between battling mutants who all have super human powers. Patrick Stewert is the leader of the good mutants and Ian Mckellen plays the bad guy. (why are  the bad guys always English?). The Story is fairly good although you cant help but think this is just a pre-curser to a sequal because it takes a fair chunk of the movie just to explain who the mutants are and what their supernatural backgrounds are. Special affects are very good as you would expect and the sound is quite amazing. As long as you dont take X Men to seriously you should enjoy it. 7 out of 10.,7,0,0,2 March 2001
Sleepy Hollow," A Modern Hammer House Of Horror Flick.
","Sleepy Hollow is superbly shot and the special affects are good and the acting is o.k but there is something about this movie that just does not do it for me. It does get a little confusing at times when they are trying to find who is responsible for the headless horseman but i dont think that is what i didnt like about it. All i can think of is that i couldnt tell if the actors and actresses were playing a serious roll or comedy rolls. Johnny Depp seemed to act with a smirk on is face that said 'This is a carry on movie , so lets camp it up ' I didnt dislike the film but on the other hand it will slip from the memory rather fast. 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,20 August 2000
We Were Soldiers," It's been seen all before.
","When i say It's been seen all before that is not a critisism of the movie because the film is not bad at all but you wont come away with any abiding memories . Mel Gibson is starting to become very predictable in his old age.He seems to pick lots of films that involve battle scenes and worrying for a practising athiest like me , there seem to be more and more religious overtones . Do we really need the church scenes? Whats the point?How does the film benefit from knowing he is a church man? Are we supposed to say ' Its ok that he sticks his bayonet in a Viet Congs throat because he believes in god'!!! Who can forget that sickly ending to Signs, when he decided to go back to being a priest! wheres the bucket?! If your a war film fan then you will love this and i urge you to look at the way Mel Gibson stand up througout the battle and does not get hit once!!!.There is one really good gory scene involving a burn victim's legs that will be the only memorable moment for me. Not bad but nothing special. 7 out of 10.",7,0,2,29 March 2003
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Amazing Chemistry from two of the best.
","When you see a film like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid a sad thought springs to mind and that is 'Isn't age a horrible thing ' I have just watched Road to Perdition which stars Paul Newman and when you see how fantastic he looks in This film to how old he looks in the latter it is a terrible shame . Redford and Newman are a fantastic double act and look as good as anybody ever has in cinema in this movie. I wouldn't say the film is fantastic in itself but what does make it a classic is the cinematography , the funny script (not the actual story) and the two lead actors. It does make me wonder why in their later years Robert Redford and Paul Newman have kept their film appearances down to a minimum and why they haven't done a film together since the 70's. I'm not sure if they fell out but one thing is for sure the chemistry they produced together in this film is a rare thing indeed. 9 out of 10.",9,2,5,19 October 2002
Snatch," Another masterpiece from Guy Ritchie
","What a film,what a film! Just when you thought Guy Ritchie couldnt come up with anything to match lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels he comes out with this brilliant movie. Ok it is fairly simular to the said movie but who cares, you cant have too much of a good thing as someone once said. This is a film about a diamond heist in the east end of London but the story really isn't that important ,what makes this film stand out is the acting and the people that make up this movie. Although the cast is mostly English the outstanding display comes from an American (as much as i hate to say it!). Brad Pitt plays a gypsy called  One punch mickey o'neil who is so much like a pikie that he could have walked of a travellers site! Brilliant!.The accent is the best portrayal of a Gypo that i have ever seen. Also ,others to come out of this movie with glowing marks are Alan Ford as Brick top and Jason Statham as Turkish. My only criticism is its not longer! A fantastic soundtrack backs a wonderfully shot movie that can only be Guy Ritchie's. 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,21 February 2001
The Beach," A Joy To watch!
","Having looked the the votes given by IMDB revewers i am really suprised The Beach only averages 5.7 out of 10. I loved this film! I had heard that some people were not keen on this film but i cant see why. Leonardo de Caprio, who is not my favourite actor by a long way, is superb as a tourist who hears while travelling in Thailand of a paradise island where there are beautifull beaches and enough weed to last a life time. He sets out to find the Island but not before he makes hi bigest mistake which is to draw a map and give it to another set of tourists. The story is superb as is the acting and there are moments which leave you with your heart in your mouth. Far, Far better than i was expecting and a joy to watch! 9 out of 10.",9,1,3,7 February 2002
Final Destination 2," Suprisingly good
",What a pleasant suprise this film was.Having seen the first film and having been underwhelmed by it this had a different affect.Although the story is no different from the first the manner in which the people die are refreshingly gory and imaginative .If that makes sense! There are some questions that are left unanswered and there are holes in the plot but thanks to the gore factor these do not matter. The acting is above average and the special affect are good. The blood count is high as it should be in a film like this. I would recommend this to any horror fan. 7 out of 10.,7,1,2,9 March 2004
Blade II," Fangtastic!
",Well what a cracking film Blade II is. I must admit i wasnt expecting too much considering the first film was average but this blows the first film out of the water! The story is superb but what makes this film is the action and special affects. The computer graphics are of the best i have ever seen. The way the Vampires turn to smouldering ash when attacked by silver is quite amazing and looks so real. This is also very gory so i would not recommend this for kids but if you love action horrors that keep you gripped i cant recommend this highly enough. Quite Brilliant. 8 out of 10.,8,0,1,8 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Still not as good as Star Wars.
",I have to admit that my viewing of Attack Of The Clones was very much spoilt because i watched it on a very poor quality DVD and therefore have a biased view on this film. From what i could see this looked a lot better than the last movie but still did not have the magic of the first three films. My theory is that the last two film have far too much Computer animation which does not have the same appeal as the Models being filmed to look like aliens or space ships as they did in Star Wars. Also i dont like the cast. Ewan Mcgregor sounds naff when he puts on that Alec Guiness accent also i think as Natalie Portman has got older she has got a lot less interesting and less pretty.Samuel L Jackson is good but we see little of him to brighten the film up. What we really need is another Harrison Ford of Mark Hammel. The Story is nothing special but its hard to tell when your watching a cheap pirate DVD. Never again will i buy one. The Kids will love this but as for true Sci Fi fans i would stay stick with Star Trek. 7 out of 10.,7,0,1,22 July 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," I'm ashamed to say i liked it!
","I never at any stage wanted to watch this film for the simple reason that i might of ended up liking the movie and bugger me i watched it and liked it! Bridget Jones's Diary is a woman's film which is why i didnt want to see it and it is the reason why i have never watched films like Titanic and ghost. It is funny and moving and very well acted , especially from Renee Zelwegger ( what a mouthfull!!) . Her accent does slip from time to time but that does not distract from a good performance that has you feeling for her as she goes from one disaster to another or should that be one man to another! You cant help but like this movie. DAMN! 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,26 October 2001
The Godfather: Part II," Pacino and De Niro star in the same film for the first time.
","The Godfather ll is a great film , although i'm not sure about it being the 7th best of all time as rated by the IMDB revewers. The most striking thing about this film is not really the story line because i'm not sure that is as good as it could be , the thing that stands out is the acting. In my opinion Robert de Niro and Pacino are the world best actors( De Niro just shading it)and this just proves my point. De Niro takes on his first real Major movie part as a young Vito Corleone taking on the characteristics of role that Marlon Brando started in the first film and Al Pacino carry's on his role as the son Michael Corleone therefore the two greats never meet in this film. 3 hours 10 minutes is maybe a little to long but never the less this film is still a great sequel. 8 out of 10.",8,1,3,26 January 2001

Notting Hill," Entertaining romantic comedy
","I must say i very much enjoyed Notting Hill even though i watched it from the discomfort of an aeroplane 37,000 feet up on the way to Florida. If you ignore the British stereotypes in the film you will discover a very enjoyable movie that is acted out to perfection simply because Julia Roberts and Hugh grant seem to be playing themselves! sit back and take in a great romantic ( and Very Funny)film.you will love it! 8 out of 10",8,0,0,10 October 1999
American Pie," All too Predictable
",American pie is a typical American college movie that is all too predictable and tries to be different by going for the shock factor but all it does is confirms that the americans are really lousy when it comes to making good comedies. why do they always have to involve some irritating college kid who is trying to lose his virginity on the prom night. How many films have the same old story?If i was you i would not listen to the hype and check out a different movie because you will have seen a hundred films just like this. 6 out of 10,6,0,0,19 March 2000
The Bourne Identity," Cracking thriller that loses it's way.
","The first hour of the Bourne Identity is as good as a thriller gets. Superb action, a great story and good acting and for the whole that is what the film is like but for me the ending is a bit to Hollywood for my liking and considering the story is good the end seems a major let down. Matt Damon is suprisingly good as in this lead role because you dont usually associate him as the beat em up James Bond type character but he pulls this off well.The car chase is one of the best you will see and a British Mini at that!Also the action scenes are superb and keep you on the edge of your seat it's just a shame the ending does not match up with the rest of the film. 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,4 October 2003

",This film was compared to Harry Potter mostly because it was released around the same time and quite rightly the critics came out in favour of The Fellowship Of The Ring but it is a very different film than Harry Potter.This a Big Spectacular adventure that has some amazing special effects and a story that has you gripped for nearly three hours which is why the abrupt ending and faliure to conclude the story stops me from going overboard about this film.Why put the viewer through such a long film and make them wait a year or so to watch the story conclude? Apart from that big dissapointment the film is very good. The special affect are ground breaking (watch the dragon firework) and the acting is very good too but make sure you save a long time to watch it and dont expect a reasonable ending. 8 out of 10.,8,0,0,30 August 2002
Cast Away," Does Hank's pull this off?
",Before i saw this film i had my own pre concieved ideas of what it would be like. I knew this film was about a guy who get stuck on a deserted island and i wondered how and if they could make this interesting.If anybody could make a film like this work it would be Tom Hanks. Lets face it how many bad film has he made?Does hanks pull it off? I'm not too sure if he does. The film is good but because of the concept of the film it is hard for it not to be a little boring and it is at times. Credit should go to Hank's because he does a De Niro stile Weight Loss to make his stay on the island look realistic but i dont think it is enough. Don't get me wrong Cast Away is not a bad film it just not that exciting.,7,0,1,10 August 2001
Armageddon," Entertaining , but full of holes
","Armageddon is a highly entertaining film that is a roller coaster ride from start to finish . I was impressed with the special affects ( even better than Deep Impact) but not too impressed with the way over the top storyline which was full of one line cliche's. Bruce willis played his usual hero type film part and Liv Tyler should stick to modelling instead of acting. Over all it was a very good action movie. 8 out of 10.

Pitch Black," Above average Sci Fi Horror
","Pitch Black is an above average horror sci fi that goes a little bit further than just good special affects. The story is about a group of people who crash land on a planet which is occupied by  crazed aliens that live and hunt in the dark. It just so happens that they land when the planet is set for its 22 yearly eclipse , hense setting these blood crazed loose. The thing i like about this film apart from the story is that you never quite know who are the nice guys. The human's characters change throughout leaving you not sure who you want to die! The cast are unknown's (unknown to me anyway) but this does not distract from the film, Vin Diesel coming out of this film with top marks but i wish he would change his name! Not bad. 7 out of 10.",7,2,2,4 February 2001
American Psycho," Too weird for words
","American Psycho is a very strange film. I cant really explain what the story is because i really didnt understand it, but i did like the underlining theme of the film which is the 1980's  and the greed that went on in wall street. The materialistic views of the yuppies and their female friends are very funny in the film and if that it what the film was solely about i would have enjoyed it but the had a story in there somewhere about a seriel killer, which to me didnt make sense and spoilt it. Perhaps if i watch it again i will understand it more but somehow i dont think so. If you were born in the 60's and grew up as a teenager in the 80's you might like the music, even if your not meant to! Way to weird for my liking. 6 out of 10.",6,0,2,29 December 2000
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Bring on T4!
","What a cracking film this is.You would think it would be hard to match up to Terminator 2 but this film does.Despite Arnie looking a little old this has everything you would want in an action film. The special affects are fantastic, the story, especially the ending is way above average and it looks great. You cant help but not like this film as it takes your breath away with it's non stop action and i wouldnt put it past the big man to make on more appearance as the terminator.Lets hope he will be back! 9 out of 10.",9,1,1,4 December 2003
U-571," Entertaining but historicaly inacurate.
","U-571 is a very entertaining film and most people could not fail to be entertained by this. It is the Story of a group US navy who are sent on a mission to retreve the German Enigma Coding machine which is crucial to the outcome of the second world war. Mathew McConaughey, Harvey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi star in this fascinating war movie. The DVD has some superb sound and visual affects so crank up the surround sound. The biggest problem i have with the film is that quite a major historical change is made to the story. Instead of the navy being the British Royal Navy , which actualy stole the enigma machine , all the heroes in this film just happen to be from the US navy which is strange because they never stole one of the coding machines until 2 years later , in which time the British had already stolen 2!!!!. Never mind, thats Hollywood i suppose. 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,28 January 2001
The Shining," Some great acting
","It as taken a long time for me to get round to watching The Shining which is a surprise considering i love Stephen king movies and films of this type (as long as they are not teenage slasher movies,Yawn). Having now seen it i can see why this scared the pants off millions of people in 1980 and even now is very scary although it does look a little dated. The acting is superb , especially from Jack Nicholson and from the young boy , Danny Lloyd. This big let down from the Shining is the end. Without giving anything away it has a Flat finish and is a bit of a cop out which , for me, spoilt the movie. Apparently Stephen king hated this adaptation of his book and refused to endorse the movie.Maybe the ending is the reason why. 7 out of 10.",7,0,3,21 February 2002
American Beauty," A story about.....people
",Many people will interpret this movie in different ways. Some will tell you this film is about something deep and meaningfull but i would argue differently. I think American pie is simply about people and more importantly its about us. What is amazing about this film is that i know at least three of these characters! I know these people! The thing that most people will agree with is that film is brilliant. A special mention must go to Anette Bening and Kevin Spacey who put in the performances of their careers. I thought about giving this a 10 out of ten and maybe i will after i watch this film again but for the time being. 9 out of 10.,9,0,0,10 December 2000
The Patriot," Ok but far,far to long and patronising.
","I have often wondered what the German people must think when they watch the WW2 film that make the Americans out to be such wonderfull people and the German soldiors to be the absolute epitemy of evil. Well now i know how they feel thanks to the wonderful Mel Gibson and his anti English films. First there was Braveheart,which incidently i thought was brilliant and now we have the Patriot which comes nowhere near Braveheart. The Only comparison i can make is that they both make they English out to be complete bastards. I suppose i am slightly clouded in my judgement of patriot because of it's anti English stance so maybe you should not take to much notice of what i think of the film. As for the film let me start by saying it's not to bad. It is entertaining but it is far too long. It could have been cut by at least an hour to make it more comfortable to watch . It also has to many sentimental moments that are quite patronising at times but that is only to be expected from Hollywood. The big plus point about the movie is the special affects during the battle scenes. At one point you watch the flight of a cannonball and the distruction it does,which is one of the best special affects i have ever seen. Watchable but not brilliant. 6 out of 10.",6,0,2,28 January 2001
Being John Malkovich," Why John Malkovich?
","If you haven't seen Being John Malkovich and you are under the impression that this film is going to be completly weird you might be a little dissapointed when you watch this. Ok it is strange but in a silly way not in an arty way which is sad. Why John Malkovich agreed to star in this or even let the film go ahead is a mystery to me. Now if the film was called' Being Bradd Pitt' or 'Being Madonna' in other words more interesting people this might have been better. There are some good parts of the film,the first half hour for instance when he first goes to his place of work , the seventh and half floor, it has you gripped and is funny in part but ,like the portal in craig's office it goes down hill from there. 6 out of 10.",6,2,5,14 May 2001
Spider-Man," The best super hero film made so far.
",Its about time we had a good super hero film made especially after the lousy Batman films and the extremly dated Superman series and Spiderman IS a good film. The special affects are outstanding and the story is interesting too. It's not dark and depressing like the batman films and the actor playing the lead role is not there just for his looks which makes a change. It is the best super hero film i have ever seen (not including Mystery men which is a comedy and is better) and lays down the standard for the up and coming Superman and hulk film that are due to be made. Kids and adults will like this and its not to violent for the younger kids too. Recomended. 8 out of 10.,8,0,0,14 October 2002
Dark City," A Batmanesque film in Gothic city!
","This film had an interesting concept about it and the special affects are fairly good to but for me it was far too dark and depressing. The director is the same person who made the Crow and i think he used the same set! The story is about a group of alien beings who , at midnight every night , send the population of this city/planet asleep in order to experiment on their minds in order to be more human. But something goes wrong as someone fails to go to sleep and starts to uncover what is going on. As a said a promising plot but all in all a bit of a let down. 6 out of 10",6,1,3,8 February 2000
The Exorcist," Dated, but still scary.
","I sat down , 18 years of after i first watched the exorcist not really knowing what i was going to think of , was it going to be dated was i still gonna be scared out of my wits like the first time i watched it? well the exorcist HAS dated but not to badly, its still horrific in its own way ( i still think' THE OMEN' is the better film) and i can see how it was banned in the UK for so many years , not the i agree with banning or censorship in any shape or form. For someone seeing the Exorcist for the first time they might come away being dissapointed but what they must realise is this film was made in 1973 and nothing had ever been seen like it.The first 40 minutes are very slow but after that things hot up! 7 out of 10",7,2,4,27 October 1999
Gandhi," Kingsley's performance is better than the film itself.
","Very , very rarely does an actor produce a performance so good that it overshadows the film because of it's brilliance. De Niro in Raging bull and Steve Mqueen in Papillon spring to mind but in my opinion Ben kingsley's performance in Gandhi is even better. The film isn't better but the the performance is. The way kingsley goes from a young lawyer to a very old and withered man is remarkable. The film itself is good if not a little dated. It isnt edge of the seat stuff and for me is maybe an hour too long but the way Attenborough bring such a large group of people (extras) together and maked these people look passionate is a great achievment. 8 out of 10.",8,8,16,23 November 2001
American History X," A Black picture of American History
",The first thing to say about about American History x is that it is a two hour film that could and should have been an hour longer and that is about the only negative thing i can think of to say about this superb movie. American history x is a brilliantly acted masterpiece of a film about a white supremisist nazi who goes to prison for the shooting of two black thieves and the story of how he comes around to believing that the whole racist scene is fundimentaly wrong and his struggle to make his brother believe the same. Great acting from all the cast but a special mention must go to Edward Norton for the lead role. 8 out of 10.,8,0,0,1 March 2000
Ocean's Eleven," A classy movie
","Lets face it with a cast that in includes Matt Damon , Brad Pitt , George Clooney and Julia Roberts this film could not fail to be a hit and although not a ten out of ten it is a good movie. This is the story of a group of professional thieves go for the entire contents of three of Las Vegas's top casino's. As it turns out , the head of the gang has alterior motives in why he wants to rob the Manager of these casino's. The best thing about the film is that it looks so good. I was in Vegas last year and this film brought back a lot of good memories for me . The worst thing about the film is the pathetic cockney accent that one of the gang use. Not quite as bad as the famous Dick Van Dyke accent in Maries Poppins but nearly as bad.What was wrong with using someone like Ray Winstone? Well worth watching. 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,15 August 2002
Tigerland," Colin Farrell is superb in this.
","Tigerland is a film that starts off like most other army training type movies and turns into a very watchable and intelligent movie that is very well acted and leaves you will that thought of ' wow , that was good' which in my opinion is the mark of a good film. The wow factor. Colin Farell is very impressive and a screen presence that is so rare in movies. I saw his performance in Minority Report and it is not a patch on this. The film is shot in a sepia ish mode which gives it a seventies feel and ads to the moody atmosphere. I very enjoyable film that is more than just another army/war movie. 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,30 November 2002
Remember the Titans," You can't fail to enjoy this.
","Remember the it exactly what you would expect from Disney, a highly watchable , feel good movie and that is not a critisism. In fact ,in my opinion Disney do not make enough movies of this ilk. Denzil Washington comes up trumps again with this film. Apart from his superb acting ability , he has a unique knack of picking great scripts, even De Niro picks his fair share of duff movies but not Denzil. Another two actors who impress in this film are Child star Hayen Panettire and Ryan Hurst. Don't expect anything out of the ordinary in this film , it is a film about winning while battling against nasty racist bigotry and is a little predictable in that respect but maybe that shows my prejudace by saying that. One question that springs to mind is Were the white Americans really this racist and if so are they still? If so , im glad i live in a country that has a good racial blend and mixes with each other without the racism of the U.S Sit back and enjoy this film , you will like it. 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,15 April 2001
Man on the Moon," An Interesting look a an interesting man
","Before i watched The Man On The Moon i new very little about Andy Kaufman. The only time we have seen him in the UK is his appearances on TAXI. I had no idea that he didnt speak with the squeaky voice in real life. I had no Idea that he was into wrestling in a big way and i had never heard of his Cabaret act Tony Clifton , although i would love to see footage of him. Jim Carey's performance is one of his better ones and his Moving performance can only do his Cv good especially after some poor recent performances. It is hard to tell what Kaufman was all about, was he retarded in any way? that is not meant in a bad way but it does seem as though he wasn't the full package at times. Childish seems the best way to describe him or is it Carey's performance that makes him look that way? Entertaining biopic. 7 out of 10",7,0,0,27 January 2002
Saving Private Ryan," A Modern Masterpiece
","Saving Private Ryan for me has to be the best war movie that has ever been made.From the first minute of this film i was total hooked, i knew i was watching a modern masterpiece which would be very hard to be beat. This film is as moving as it is sickening. sickening in the respect of the horific portrayal of the landings in France . How most of the soldiers never stood a chance , dying a horrible death before they got of the boats! Tom Hanks is fantastic as usual . I promise you cant watch this film without be deeply moved. Spielberg does it again! 9 out of 10",9,0,1,10 November 1999
28 Days Later...," Started well but rapidly went downhill.
","I had read some good review for 28 days later and equally some bad ones and im afraid my review sits firmly in the 'bad' bracket. It is such a shame when you see a film that starts promisingly , as this does, and turns into a dull hotchpoch nothing of a film. I hate to give UK movies a bad press but as anyone can see this film should have ended at 45 minutes and cut their losses while it was still interesting. The scenes in London at the start of the film are well worth seeing and its hard to believe how they got the city so empty but im afraid that all that is good about the film. Maybe you will like it like some of the critics but i somehow doubt it. 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,29 May 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," He who believes hype is the one who is dissapointed.
",What a major let down! I waited ages for to see this expecting a spectacular masterpiece that had me spellbound but what i got was a slow movie that left me empty and let down. the special affects were good but if you are not a martial arts fan then they leave you cold. Who cares if the people can run over buildings? i could if i had wire strapped to my back. Who cares if they can fight? What wanted was a story that that tugged at my emotions and left me stunned but this didnt come close . Also it was full of chinese proverbs that got irritating. proverbs such as ' if the tiger is asleep the bear isnt hungry ' What is that all about! Maybe its because i dont like martial arts films that i give this a bad review but i still think this was dull. 4 out of 10.,4,1,2,16 August 2002
JFK," Memorable for THAT home made assassination movie.
","I Have seen JFK 4 or 5 times now and each time i never fail to be shocked at the real life movie of John F Kennedy having his brains blown out.It is an amazing piece of footage that gives this film an edge unlike any other. Although this movie is over 3 hours long it flies by because it is is so engrossing and fascinating. Oliver Stone pieces together a great conspiracy movie that will without doubt have you believing that there was far more to the shooting of the president that originally met the eye. An all star cast including Kevin Bacon,Tommy Lee Jones,Kevin Costner and Gary Oldman all ad to the good of the movie. Costner has been critisised for being a little boring in movies but this has to be his best performance, if not a little over the top in his final summing up scene in the court. A masterpiece. 9 out of 10.",9,2,13,27 August 2001
K-19: The Widowmaker," Tense Thriller
","If you can forget Harrison Ford's really naff Russian accent for a moment you find a really good thriller here. A film that is well worth watching and at no point has you looking at the clock even though it is over 2 hours long. The acting from all the cast is very comendable and you do feel that you are on the submarine experiancing everything that is going on.It is good to see a Hollywood film made seeing the Russian perspectave instead of the US one. The make up deserves a mention too , the scenes at the end when we see liam Neilson and Harrison Ford as old men are the best i have seen at making an actor look old. 8 out of 10.",8,1,1,30 May 2003

","I had no idea what to expect from Moulin Rouge except for i knew it was a musical which fills me with dread as i hate musicals.What i saw was a brilliant piece of film making that is unlike anything i have seen before. For starters the music was not what i was expecting , it encorporates modern pop songs instead of fluffy , new , songs which made it all the more enjoyable. The photography is fantastic especially the panning from one building to another and the rushing from street to street and the set is brilliant. The story is hardly rocket science and is easy to follow especially because the cast is headed by two brilliant young performers in Nocole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.The rest of the cast are superb too. If you have any pre concieved ideas about Moulin Rouge forget them and enjoy. 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,9 July 2002

","Let me get this bit out of the way because i'm sure everyone else has said it ' Men in black 2 is not as good as the first film' Ok i feel better for that. Now let's get down to the reasons. 1.It is to much like the first film.there is nothing to make us sit back and say wow! 2.Some of the affects are appalling.Especially when Will Smith is fighting the subway worm. 3.There does not seem to be the same enthusiasm from  Will Smith in this as in the first film.Also he kept going into his Ali accent.Was he making  that film at the same time.? The plus points are that the Alien characters are superb especially the dog and that at 80 odd minutes 'it's length  is just right. All in all not to bad , but it had a lot to live up to. 7 out of 10.",7,1,2,31 July 2003
Rules of Engagement," A Good movie but does it send out the wrong message?
",Rules of Engagement is a very intreging film that is fascinating and makes you ask a lot of questions of the characters and of the actions they take. Samuel L Jackson plays Colonol Terry Childers who goes into the Yemen to bring home the ambassador and is caught up in a violent situation which results in the death of 83 civilians. He is charged with murder by the US government and is taken to court.He enlist the help of life long friend and defence lawyer Hayes Hodges( Tommy Lee Jones)to try to get him off the hook.

Donnie Brasco," The Second best Gangster movie ever made behind Goodfellas
","Donnie Brasco has everything that could be asked for in a movie.Brilliant Acting, a fantastic Script and a rivitting story and they are the reasons why i feel this is the second best gangster movie ever made behind Goodfellas and it's not far behind Goodfellas either . This is the true story of an undercover cop who infiltrates the New York mafia, who get to be good friends with them yet still has to rat them out which leads to their convictions and for some death. Johnny Depp comes up with his best ever acting performance as Donnie Brasco and Al Pacino is out of this world as the wise guy who vouched for him to get him in on the inside. Pacino's performance is as good as any i have ever seen. He comes across as a likable but sad character who ultimately pays for befriending Donnie. The scene where he gets the phone call asking him to come to a meeting where he knows he is going to be wacked is very moving.  films like this only come along once in a very long time. 10 out of 10.",10,0,3,6 January 2002
Casualties of War," Yet another great Viet Nam Movie
","I was thinking after watching Casualties Of War of how many good films feature the conflict in Viet Nam. Deer Hunter,Apocolypse Now etc in fact i cant really think of a bad film made on the Subject. This film is no acception. Michael J Fox and Sean Pen star in this gritty drama about a young soldier who tries to bring justice to the rest of his platoon for raping and Murdering a local girl. Fox is superb (why did he not take on more serious roles like this)as is Sean Pen. The film flows and is highly watchable if not a little disturbing. Brian De Palma comes up trumps.

The Evil Dead," Very Dated.
",I remember when i first saw The Evil Dead 20 years ago in a bar in Spain and i remember the excitement i felt when i watched the film.It was like nothing i had ever seen before and was talked about by all my fellow teenage mates. In a funny sort of way i wished i looked at films now as i did then but then i wasn't interested in how bad the acting was or how appalling the direction was and all i was concerned about was the blood and gore.Having watched the film again i can really see how dreadfull some aspects of the film are.Having said that this film is still creepy and atmospheric but has dated incredibly badly.  Bruce Campbell's performance as the leading man is so bad it borders on funny and must be one of the worst acting performances i have ever seen. This film really smacks of a low budget movie but because of my teenage memories of siting in a bar in Benidorm being scared out of my wits this film will always hold some good memories. 5 out of 10.,5,1,6,16 June 2003

","Mission Impossible 2 is exactly what i expected hence i was not dissappointed and actualy enjoyed the film. there are masses of stunts and special effects that are stunning and are great to watch with surround sound and a large screen but if you are after a film with a fantastic story then forget it. I wont bother to explain the plot because it does not really matter MI2 is just an action film, which in a way is a shame because there are some great actors in this film, one of the best in fact,no not Tom Cruise(although i think he is good)but Ving Rhames who in my opinion is one of the best. It is just a shame he does not have much of a vehicle with this film. All in all quite entertaining. 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,24 December 2000
Black Hawk Down," Action all the way!
","If your a lover of war films that are more action than suspense you will love Black Hawk Down.This is a brilliantly shot film that shows a group of American troups caught up in the conflict in Somalia and how they tried to assassinate a rebel leader with disasterous consequences. What is strange is this war happened in 1993 , three years after the Gulf war yet at the time I don't remember hearing too much about it. While this is not in the class of Platoon or Saving Private Ryan this is still a good film which contains some of the best action sequences I have ever seen. You do feel at times that you are there and that you are fighting the battle too and that must say a lot for how good the film is. Some of the shots with the Grenade launchers are fantastic as are the devastating scenes following their hits.One critisism is that you don't tend to get to involved with the characters , therefore you don't feel too upset when disaster befalls them. An above average movie that grips you from start to finish. 8 out of 10.",8,10,18,19 September 2002

The Insider," One Legend and one up and coming actor come together.
","Russell Crowe is fast gaining a great reputation as one of the top hollywood actors and his performance in THE INSIDER does nothing to dispell this.

Pacino , for the first time, comes up against his own bosses who are frightened about losing billions through litigation from the tobbaco company. This film is 2 and a half hours long and not for one minute did i get bored , it is totaly inthralling and more than anything it is an insight into what can and has gone on in the news reporting business.On the cover of the DVD it says'The Insider will thrill you with its unbelivable twists and turns'. i'm not sure what they are talking about there because this is hardly the sixth sense but The Insider is still a great movie. 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,9 January 2001
This Is Spinal Tap," Includes such classics as'Lick my love pump'!!
","Spinal tap is what you would call a typical Cult movie and what i mean by that is , it is a film that is sometimes looked back on with so much romantisism that it seems better in the memory than it actualy really is. I hadn't seen This Is Spinal Tap for many years and and i often looked back on the film with fondness and i still do after seeing the film today but not quite as much. What is unusual about this film , and i dont often say this about films is,that it is to short at 80 minutes but having seen the DVD with all the extra scenes it is a wonder as to why this film was not made longer when originally put together. It's hard to say to much about the acting because i would presume Christopher Guest,Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and Rob Reiner ad lib a vast majority of the film and brilliant at it they are. Some of the scenes are so funny and they will go above the heads of many people but i just think it is getting a little dated. 7 out 0f 10",7,2,7,3 February 2001

","Toy story 2 is fits in a small ban of its own along with Terminator 2 and Godfather 2 in being that it is a sequel that is better than the original. Not a great deal better than the first but better never the less.The animation is of the highest order up there with Chicken Run although not quite as good in my opinion. The Story revolves around Woody the cowboy who is accidentaly sold to a collector to make a set along with Jessie,Bullseye and Stinky Pete who plans to sell them to a Japanese Buyer. Meanwhile Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the toys carry out a daring rescue attempt. Very funny. 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,29 December 2000

","Its quite rare in my opinion that Hollywood comes up with a comedy that is as funny as this.There Something About Mary has so may memorable funny moments that it is hard to think of any other comedy , other than the Monty Python films that comes close to being as funny. The Farrely Brothers seem to be in a league of their own in the American comedy market. There are classic moments in this film such as the Hair gel , the dog fight and the 'We have a bleeder!' scene that will stand in the memory forever. Matt Damon , Ben Stiller and Lee Evans are brilliant as the guys who are infactuated with the beautifull Mary and all are very funny and only add to what is a one of the best American comedies ever made. 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,11 February 2003

Apparently he trained in the boxing ring for a year before filming started and it was definately worth it. What is even more amazing is that this story is a true one. There will not be many people who fail to be touched by the acting,the story and the over all humanity of this picture. Nearly as good as Raging Bull...nearly. 9 out of 10.",9,0,2,8 January 2001
A Clockwork Orange," What is all the fuss about?
","I really do wonder what all the fuss about with Clockwork Orange. O.k it does have a bit of violence and a little bit of nudity and maybe it was a bit strong for 1971 but not enough for it do get the notoriety it has. The biggest controversy about this for me is that it got that much publicity and perhaps Kubric deserves the praise for hyping a less than brilliant film up banning it. As for the movie itself , it is weird and does look good as do all Kubriks films but i certainly wont bother watching it again. i'm not sure if it trying make a political statement but if was it was lost on me. The first half an hour is apalling and i almost considered turning it off which i hardly ever do but as the film went on it got better or should i say a little less sureal . Malcolm McDowell is brilliant in the film and is the only reason i stuck with it but boy , was he an ugly young man!Age has treated him well. 5 out of 10.",5,1,4,2 May 2002
The Legend of 1900," A Great Story
","The legend of 1900 is a film i defy anybody not to like. It is a moving film that has you hypnotised by it's beauty and charm and leaves you wanting for more. Tim Roth stars as a young man who was born on a cruise liner and is a musical genius, the problem is he cannot leave the ship for reason's that we try to learn to understand and ultimately are his downfall. The man who tries to get him to leave and is his best friend is played by Pruiit Taylor Vince and he , for me, is the star of the film. I have critisised Vince before when i did a review of Nurse Betty but in this ,he is the star , even above Roth. Although this film is 2 hours long it flies by and in my opinion could even do with a little longer. This is a gem and should not be missed. 8 out of 10.",8,3,8,5 May 2002
From Hell," Does not do old Jack Justice.
","Considering the worldly known legend of Jack The Ripper it is suprising there has not been a top class movie made about him. From Hell is possibly the best so far but it falls a long way short of being a top movie.This looks good and the acting is ok even the accents werent as bad as i was expecting but the story is a major let down. ******* Spoiler Alert ******** This version of the ripper story lays the murders down to a group of free Mason's which while i have a personal dislike to Free Masonary and their pathetic antics , it's hardly a great conclusion to one of London's most famous mysteries. You can also see that this is a Hollywood production because as per usual they portray 19th century London as Foggy , Cold , full of Prostitutes and drunks and it is constantly night. Our American cousins must think we live like bats! 7 out of 10.",7,0,2,8 December 2002
Reservoir Dogs," A BLOODY classic!
","Reservoir Dogs will always go down as one of the most violent yet brilliant pieces of work ever to be shown on the silver screen. Tarrentino's script is brilliant and what is even more amazing is that it is his first movie. The acting is top grade , all the actors seem to come up with the performance of lives. There were calls when the film was released for it to be banned by the lilly livered liberals and while this is bloody and the language is coarse, for it to be banned would have deprived us of a classic Hollywood movie that oozes class as well as blood! 10 out of 10",10,168,286,3 January 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick saved his best till last.
","There is something about Eyes wide Shut that had me transfixed through out the movie. Was it the acting that made me love this film or was it the story ? Was it the dialogue ot was it just the sight of the Beautifull Nicole kidman? All of these reasons and more are why i cant recommend Eyes Wide Shut highly enough. Stanley Kubrick was not my cup of tea , i think lots of his movies are far to pretentious but he saved his best movies to last without a doubt. If your expecting a fast moving flick that has you on the edge of your seat then this is not for you but if it is film that is spell binding and thought provoking you are after then you have found it with this stunningly visual film. Not to be missed. 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,28 February 2002
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," One of the best films ever made
","This film is a true compliment to British film making. Lock stock is a masterpiece , the British ' Goodfellas' if you like. The story is superb as well as the characters and the acting and it is filmed magnificently. Take a look at the scene in whick Nick realises that he has lost the Card game, Film making at its best.Not all the people in the film are actors Vinny Jones is a Pro Footballer and Lenny Mclean a real life bare Knuckle boxer ( now sadly dead)but they carry of their part like they have been acting for years. I can't wait to see the Follow up ' Diamonds' which is being made in London as i write this.  10 out of 10",10,0,1,8 December 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," I can see why the kids like it.
",My review of this film may be a little blinded by the fact that i hate kids films but that apart i can see why kids would like this film. The story is very good as are the special affects and there is a very good cast of actors. The shame is that the lead star is the poorest of all the actors including all the other child actors. It's ok to have the Harry Potter look but it does help have the acting abilty too and i'm afraid Daniel Radcliffe does not have it. Robbie Coltrane and Richard Harris are superb . I have not seen read the book (im one of the few!)so i have an unbiased point regarding the comparison but i can see how the book would have some appeal if it is anything like the film. All in all not bad but not my cup of tea. 7 out of 10.,7,0,1,4 June 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Superb action , pretentious storyline.
","I wasnt really looking forward to watching Matrix Reloaded for a couple of reasons. First is that i didnt think the first film was as good as the hype sugested and secondly the reviews all said that the storyline was complicated and difficult to understand. After watching the film i was pleasantly suprised. I enjoyed it. It's true that the story is complicated and i didnt understand it for one minute but thats not really important as long as you know who are the good guys and who are the bad bad guys that is enough because the action is fantastic. Im not a lover of martial arts film but this is the best i have seen as regards the fight scenes. You have got to see the bit when the lead guy fights all the Mr Smiths in the courtyard, it is amazing. So if your not sure if to watch the film then i say , do so. Forget about trying to understand the story because you wont. Just enjoy the action. 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,22 October 2003
Enemy at the Gates," A Hidden gem
","Enemy at the gates is one of those films that is not massive box office material and was not heavily promoted when released , which makes it all the more of a treat when watching it. i wasnt expecting to much and what i got was a joy. Enemy at the gate feels like a low production film while still look superb and that is no critisism. The film revolves around a young Russian sniper who becomes a hero for killing many German officers in the fight to save Stalingrad. Because of the impact of these assisinations the Germans send their best Sniper to try and Kill the Russian.It sounds like a good story and it is. Good performances from Jude law and Ed Harris ad to this compelling movie. 8 out of 10.",8,0,2,11 October 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Possibly the best acting performance i have ever seen.
","Forget what you think about Russel Crowe , forget that he is not the friendliest of people if you believe the papers.Just watch A Beautifull Mind and see what is in my opinion one of the finest acting performances i have ever seen if not the the best. Very rarely does a film have an affect on me like this. I defy you not to have tears in eyes at the end and any film that can affect a cold hearted sod like me like that deserves as many accolades as it can get. It's not action packed , it's not funny and its not modern but what this film is is unique. Very rarely has anybody been able to portray madness on the big screen as brilliantly as this and you do have a fantastic insight as to what can go on the mind of a genius who is on the edge. Top marks to the Director Ron Howard and the writer Sylvia Nassar for a ground breaking beautifull movie. 10 out of 10.",10,0,2,20 September 2002
Scream 2," The same as the original?
","scream 2 is very very much like the original which i suppose is what they were trying to do, to carry on from the first movie's success. Without giving anything away the people who get killed and the people who do the killing are very predictable as is the whole movie.It was not that bad though , i just hope they dont make a scream 3 because they have just about exhausted the story line. 6 out of 10",6,0,1,23 July 1999
The Green Mile," Is this the best film ever made?
","If you are set in your ways ( Like me) you tend to be narrow minded and unlikely to change your mind when it comes to your all time favourite film. For 15 years it has been Monty Python's life of Brian and i could never see a day when that would change....until now. I have just witnessed a film that has had an affect on like no other before. The Green Mile is a masterpiece and i could not do it justice by trying to describe what the film is about but what i will tell you is that i defy you not to cry. I did and believe me i NEVER cry when i watch a movie until today. This movie is over 3 hours long but please dont let that put you off because you will be spellbound throughout and you won't even look at the clock.The acting is of the highest i have ever seen simply because every one who is in this film are wonderful , including the the two nasty guys. I ended up hating them as much as i loved the good guys which is a sign of great acting ,but the final word must be left for Michael Clarke Duncan who plays John Coffey.I havent seen this guy in any film before but im sure we will be seeing him for years to come. What a wonderfull performance.This film is quite simply , Brilliant. 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,12 November 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," A Story about triumph over adversity
",In years to come the Shawshank Redemtion will be seen as a classic and rightly so. The is a wonderfully moving story about a bonding friendship between two men who are locked up in Shawshank prison for differing reasons. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deserve any praise that can be heaped apon them because i feel it is them more so than the story that hooks you from the first time you meet the characters.You feel for them and you hope that thing turn out for the best . If i had to critisise the film for anything it would be the lack of an ageing process that the men go through but that is nit picking. A film you could watch over and over again. 9 out of 10,9,0,1,10 June 2000
Blow," A story about parenthood.
","Blow is a film that is not so much about the drugs trade but more about Parenthood and how precious it is. Johhny Depp is excellent in the role of George a big time grugs runner of the seventies who's life goes pear shaped ant various stages which has a huge affect on firstly his mother and father , then his wife and ultimately and most sadly his daughter. The acting is very good from all the cast and it is good to see Ray loita pulling of a brilliant performance and for me stealing the show as george's father. Its just a shame that the make up wasnt as good as it could be when the characters age. We also have Depp narratting in a Goodfellas style which only adds to the enjoyment . 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,22 November 2002
Raging Bull," De Niro's performance is better than the film itself
","Raging Bull will always go down as a cinematic classic not so much in my opinion for the film itself but for one of the most amazing acting performances ever seen.De Niro goes from a very fit healthy man to a very fat overweight loser. I doubt an actor has ever gone through so much for a film and this film just shows why the man is the most respected actor in Hollywood. As for the film , im not sure it actually is as good as i could have been but it's great to see Joe Pesci teaming up with Robert De Niro again  .According to the credits at the start of the Film Jake Le Motta actually had a say in the film and if that is so he is a very brave man because he comes across as a nasty piece of work that deserved every thing that came to him. I also think the boxing scenes are very poorly filmed, they are way over the top and as any boxing fan will tell you , boxing matches are nothing like what we see in the film. I would love to have seen this film made on colour because im not sure that the black and white worked as well as they would have liked but i'm sure most people will disagree with that. 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,22 June 2001
Vanilla Sky," Odd but interesting.
",Tom Cruise has done his career no harm over the last 3 years with the choice of films he has decided to do and Vanilla Sky is no exception although it's by no means his best. This is an odd film that is confusing for the most part but it's not a film that you can say is dull. It does have you guessing right to the end as to what is happening. Is he dreaming? Is he going mad? Is it actually happening? In the end the answer didnt really matter as the film was unique and highly watchable and very well acted. Penelope Cruz looks stunning and her acting is of the highest order and charms the viewer nearly as much as she Charms her on and off screen boyfriend. 7 out of 10.,7,4,7,27 December 2002
Any Given Sunday," One of the best sports movies ever made.
","Let me start by saying that i dont like or even understand american football and i personally think it does not come close to soccer but with this film it did not matter a jot. Oliver Stone had directed a film here that crosses all bounderies. You dont have to like the sport or understand it to appreciate how brilliant this film is. It is shot so well ,it makes you fell you are in the game and as for the soundtrack well that just adds to a mesmerising showpiece. Stars such as Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid,James Woods and Cameron Diaz star but for me the real Star of this film is James Foxx who plays the Quaterback who begins to believe his own hype but ultimately understands that it the team that matters. One of the test of a good film is that if you start to look at the clock throughout the film is usually means its not good , this film lasted 2 and a half hours and i never looked at the time. Brilliant. 9 out of 10.",9,48,84,4 January 2001
Signs," A really good , scary movie.
",There are lots of good reasons why you should watch Signs. The main one being that it is a bloody good and entertaining movie that always has you on the edge of the seat without showing loads of gore and guts. As usual it's what you dont see that makes this movie scary. I love the parts where we see the family watching the News and the progress of the alien invasion. This adds to the tension and quite cleverly tells the story of what is happening outside the house. The acting is not brilliant and Mel Gibson struggles to decide if he is going put on a serious face or a comical face. Sometimes in movies he plays his parts as if he is always in a Leathal Weapon film. But all in all this is a very good film. 8 out of 10.,8,0,2,13 February 2003
Identity," Too far fetched to make it a good film.
","As so often happens a film starts really well, it gets the movie goer hooked and then? It dissapears up its own back side in the attempt to be to clever or to try and put in a breath taking twist that fails in this case , big time. This film had lots of promise and a good cast , lets face it we could watch anything with Ray Liotta in it couldnt  we? But instead of this being an above average slasher/stalker type film it decided to go all deep and paranormal and in the end lost all credability. As for the twist , well , without giving anyhing away it will make you laugh out loud its so pathetic. Anyway , you might like it but it was way to clever for it's own good in my opinion. 6 out of 10.",6,4,8,4 February 2004
The Sixth Sense," Superb horror with a twist.
","I really enjoyed the Sixth Sense even though i was told what the twist was before i watched it. I think i would have liked it even better if i hadn't known what the ending was. This film is a little slow but the moments when the young boy actually came face to face with the ghost were really scary , i only wish there could have been more moments like when he met the ghost in the kitchen who he thought was his mother. The acting from the boy was fantastic even thought i hate watching child actors and Bruce Willis, was, well, Bruce Willis!.Its a film that you will want to watch twice and i'm not telling you why! 8 out of 10",8,0,0,11 May 2000

There are parts in this film that are stupid,especialy the inept F.B.I agents , they dont seem to fit into this film and they just fade away without any mention at the end . This was the first film i ever saw on my new DVD player and the extras on the disc are cool. 7 out of 10.....just.",7,1,4,28 December 2000

","Although the Matrix is an entertaining movie there was something missing from the film that i could not quite put my finger on. Perhaps the Storyline was a little too confusing or perhaps i was expecting Better special effects , i don't know. The Matrix all in all is a good film without living up to some of the hype the papers indulged in. The Acting is good but not Brilliant while the storyline showed so much promise but it did not deliver. I still can't understand where the ship was that they were living in.Perhaps we wasn't supposed to know. 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,3 December 1999
Thirteen Days," Gripping political drama
",If kevin Costner has any sense he should stick to films such as this and JFK because it seems to be where he has found a happy medium. Having said that although Costner is very good in Thirteen days the best acting performances come from Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp who play john and Robert Kennedy respectively . I must admit i knew very little about the cuban missile crisis before seeing this film and i never realised how close we really came to war with the Russians. The way the film builds up the tension of the American political system and how they try to plan every eventuality in the conflict is superb and makes two and a half hours fly by which is always a sign of a good film for me. The dialogue is fantastic and really shows how Kennedy not only had to battle against the Russian's but also against people in his own Government. Good Stuff. 8 out of 10.,8,0,0,15 March 2002
Cube," It Promised so much , but alas....
","Cube could have been so much better , the potential for a great movie was there, the Idea was superb. 6 people stuck in a cube , each side had a door which lead to another cube , the problem being some cubes were booby trapped to kill. The film started really well and the special affects at the beginning was outstanding , but why didn't they film carry on in the same vein? The most interesting person of the 6 got killed before anybody else leaving the others ,all of who were really irritating , to argue with each other.I didn't care who kicked the bucket out of the five , in fact i was kind of hoping they would all walk into a room and get cheese wired!

The Thin Red Line," Platoon II ?
","The thin Red Line is a very good war movie which reminded me a little of Platoon in the way that it portrays the personalities fighting the war rather than the actual war itself. The film is set around C platoon who try to take a hill which is heavily guarded by Japanese Soldiers.It follows three relationships in the movie.A sergeant and the corporal, a private and his wife and private and his sergeant. The music fits to the film superbly and photography is great. The acting is wonderfull epecially from Sean Penn,Elias Koteas and Adrien Brody. if you want to watch this movie for the acting of George Clooney , John Travolta  and Woody Harrelson you will be disapointed as they only have cameo roles. 8 out of 10",8,0,1,23 February 2000
The Great Escape," Hardly the great escape!
","The Great Escape is a film that everybody raves about and looks back at with rose tinted glasses . Having seen this for the first time in 20 years i think this is a good film but maybe overrated simply for the fact the ,one , it is way too long at 2 hours and 45 minutes and secondly there are so many silly moments they could never have happened for real. ***** SPOILER ALERT******** It looked like a holiday camp to me with all the prisoners mixing with each other at any times they wanted. They could treat the guards with distane and could get hold of anything they wanted.Why get shot escaping, just stay there and enjoy it until the war is over. Why put all the top RAF escape's in one camp? Surely you would split them up.The Comandant and guards looked like the most inept German soldiers i have ever seen in a war film. Why call the film the Great Escape ? It was hardly great. only 25 escaped and 50 were shot dead! James Coburn's accent was laughable too. Having said all that the film is still ok but mainly down to the musical score by Elmer Bernstien. The music makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up because it is so rousing. Only one other musical score is better than the Great Escape and that is the one for The Magnificent Seven and that is Elmer Bernstien's work too. Steve Mqueen has an aura about him too that not many actors have ever possesed and it is such a shame that he died when he did. 7 out of 10.",7,1,4,11 October 2002
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Watch this or i will bite your legs off!
","Without a shadow of a doubt Monty Python produced the funniest films ever made.The Holy Grail is the first of the feature movies (not including Now For something Completely Different)and although superbly funny it is not as funny as The Meaning Of Life or the funniest film ever made The Life Of Brian. The Python team set out to find the Holy Grail and along the way they meet sureal characters  ,sing silly songs and come up the silliest and extremely funny dialogue you will ever hear, such as, the french knights who fight by insulting their enemies with taunts such as 'I wave my private parts at your aunties, you cheesy lot of second hand electric donkey bottom biters!' The problem i have with The Holy Grail is the ending. I Know Python's humour is very , very, sureal at times but without giving the ending away it tries to be python like yet fails letting the audiance down.

Gangs of New York," Good film but the ending seemed rushed.
",I know there were real problems with the making of Gangs of New York and that it took a lot longer to put out than Martin Scorsesi would have liked and to be quite honest apart from the rushed ending you wouldnt notice . Although two and a half hours long it is not a film that drags because of some of the brilliant performances on show especially from Daniel Day Lewis and Leornardo De Caprio also the story is gripping which is why the ending is such a let down. You get the impression that for over two hours the film had been building up to a fantastic climax yet it didnt get the one it deserved.

This really does have feel of of a Hen Hur type epic and it deserves all the plaudits it gets. The Computer technology and the cinamatography that make up this film is breath taking as are the fight scenes.

Born on the Fourth of July," The worst false moustache in Cinematic History!
","The first thing to say about Born On the Fourth Of July is that it is no where near Oliver Stone's best best movie and that is is not Tom Cruise's best acting role (perhaps it was a poor year for movies when he won the Oscar). Having said that the film is good and is an eye opener for anybody unclear on How America treated it's war veterans when they came home from Viet Nam. This film does lack a certain grittyness which other Viet Nam film such as Platoon and Apocolypse Now have. Maybe the problem is that this film takes itself too seriously, Where is the humour? I know it a serious subject but Stone does forget to inject any humour into the movie which is a shame because a film as long as this does need an eliment of relief from the subject matter. Finally, whet were they thinking of when they gave Tom Cruise that stupid facial hair?? It looks so false ! 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,21 February 2002
Goodfellas," A Masterpiece
","What can you say about Goodfellas that has not already been said? It is difficult to review a film that nearly everybody has seen and nearly everybody loves. Goodfellas is without doubt the best gangster film ever made and in my opinion in the top three films of all time. Ray Liota,Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are all fantastic but for me the latter steals the show. Joe Pesci is the most frightening gangster ever seen for me and the scene where he winds Liota up with his 'how am i funny' in the resterant is scary! Scorsese directs this film like no other. You can watch this film over and over again and see something new everytime (and i have). I think what also makes Googfellas so viewer friendly is the narration by Liota throughout the movie.You are never left in doubt as to what is going on.I must have seen Goodfellas a dozen times now and i'm sure there will be many more times i watch it. For fans of the Soprannos look out for how many people are in this and the HBO gangster show. I counted at least 5. 10 out of 10.",10,0,3,1 September 2001
High Fidelity," Another Intelligent comedy from Nick Hornby
","I'm not one of these people who can watch a film over and over again because i get bored to easily but once in a while a film comes a long that you think after watching it' i would like to see that again' and High Fidelty is one such film. It stars Nick Cusack as a record store owner who is having a mini mid life crisis when it comes to his relationships. This is a very intelligent movie and funny throughout which i dont say too often about American comedy's but the Yanks cant claim this one for themselves. Although the acting from everyone is superb the real hero of this movie is Nick Hornby the writer. He has written a book that is so engrossing that you cant fail to be mesmerised by the film. If you are new to Nick hornbys work watch the film FEVER PITCH or read the book of the same name , it is of the same mould as Fever Pitch. The best way i can describe Fever pitch and High Fidelty is that they are love stories for both women and men , maybe they are even more suited to men and how many love story's can you say that about? Very,very good. 9 out of 10.",9,6,11,11 June 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Another bore from the Coen Brothers.
","I have cime to the conclusion that when it comes to films from the Coen brothers there is conspiracy going on. First it was Fargo,then The Big Lebowski and now this. Each of these films were given rave reviews for being classic comedies, the question is WHY????????????? Fargo was dull and if it wasnt for Willam H Macy would have been unwatchable. The Big Lebowski was as funny as piles and now this film takes the biscuit! O Brother Where Art Thou? is as unfunny as it is boring. Nothing of any significance happens to make the viewer laugh. Nothing happens to make this film interesting in ANY way. Goerge Clooney does his best but the poor script makes it impossible for him to come out of this with any merit. Who ever decided that this rubbish should be rewarded with a Golden Globe had fall for what most critics have...The Coen Con!

It is the acting in the Godfather that makes this film stand out not really the storyline. We see such actors as Marlon Brando,James Caan and Robert Duvall pull off some of their best performances of their careers but the final word must be left for Al Pacino. This is as far as i know Pacino's first real leading role and doesn't he grab the part by the horns! A Classic film that has not dated at all. 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,30 November 2000
