The Equalizer," Denzel is great, as always!
","Now is the time for us to get a chance of judging a notable actor's performance in a brand new production, which will became at lea, t as classic as the actor in the leading role after a few years, and its name will definitely not sink into oblivion.Although, I haven't got any little thoughts about the plot, and I haven't seen the trailer either, I'd been feeling myself really excited about movie, because Denzel Washington as one of my favorite actors, who hasn't made any disappointing movie so far in his carrier. And this was the same in the case of The Equalizer. The acting performance is simply phenomenal! Denzel is visualizing the usual figure who probably has been an outstanding but now already retired spec ops agent, what we cannot be bored of. The Oscar-winning actor brings life a character of the same style on the canvas almost every time, but somehow he's still able to show the audience something new. If it's needed, than ha could be funny and humorous, he could be sympathetic and patient, but he could also be very tough and serious if the situation required that. This is the character which is well- known by the wide audience, but sometime he could always produce some new attributes and different nature.The other actors also performed a flawless job. This is Chloe Grace Morez's first performance when she appeared on the big screen like character seemed to be really natural to me, so that I couldn't have noticed the slightest spark of acting. But I mean this in the good sense. The character's really come to life on the screen.The storyline is simply brilliant! The very beginning felt a bit sluggish, during the first 10-15 minutes, I would have been thinking that we would get a fairly towed movie. But later the plot will have the ability of catching the audience's attention so hard, that you won't feeling of when will it end' or this movie is so tardy' for a minute of the 130 minutes runtime. Around the 40th minute of the whole movie it pushes a so brutally epic scene into your face, what your brain can hardly accept and process. It's a so well choreographed and perfectly executed scene, that usually could be seen only seen at the end of the movie as the finale of the whole production. I've also had the feeling of the movie's ended, because the scene was immediately followed by 5-10 minutes of peaceful atmosphere, but fortunately it's darkened really soon, and the tension kept going on.The villains are popping up right after each other in the film, and we constantly have the opportunity of getting know the bad guys taking their place higher and higher on the hierarchy of the underworld. Marton Csokas has the ability of representing the irritatingly arrogant and disgusting right hand of the mafia, who's dealing with all the dirty affairs of his boss. But almost everybody will like his character despite of his repulsive nature, but because of the excellent acting performance.I also bow down before the writer, because the dialogues are so funky and fast-paced, what I think I haven't experienced for years before. Danzel's usual humorous style against the good guys could prevail as effectively just as the usual condescending, and efficiently argumentative style against the bad guys. He could even twirl the minds of the most elusive and dodgiest criminals effectively by the play of words, so that they could react with only silence, big eyes and open-mouth.The restrictions on age in the film is completely legitimate, because the fighting scenes are made so brutal and expressive, that hey hit the screen with true vengeance. I've almost felt the pain when I heard the cracking of an arm or by the sight of a knife slicing through a limb of a lucky man. The camera work is not the most appropriate in every single moment, because there were some hand-to-hand combat scenes where I could have barely seen what's really happening and who's actually hit who. But there is not any bigger (and other) mistakes in the whole movie at all that I could take into account. Denzel tries to get to the Russian mafia totally alone, which could sound totally crazy and incredible, but somehow the movie could present the happenings in a more or less realistic way in front of our eyes, so that we can totally accept this fact.I don't want to spoil the plot and overall essence of the film, because it's far more pleasuring to realize it by ourselves by seeing the whole production.Overall, the movie is great! In my opinion it could smoothly deserve the movie of the year title, and I'd dare to risk a couple of Oscars. Although the movies of this kind are unfortunately not often welcomed by the academy. Shame on them! Nevertheless, I would recommend the film to almost everyone who has the ability of enduring the brutality on a serious level. And for the fans of Denzel it's a must-see masterpiece!Rating 9/10",9,2,6,28 October 2014
Interstellar," Space Odyssey 2014
","Every time I have to judge a movie that somehow could be related to Christopher Nolan's name I feel myself like starting in a handicap position. I'd like to clarify that I've absolutely no problem with the famous director's work, indeed! I admit, that we're talking about one of the most notable directors of our world in recent times. The company of his fans has significantly expanded with numerous new and exceedingly biased people who tend to execute me immediately just because of the fact that I don't consider perfect all the products that can be found in the director's rich portfolio. In addition, Hollywood has made many attempts to sell numerous movies by using the well- know fame of Nolan's name, so his name has become a bit boring to me nowadays. But let's get started!I don't dare to call the basic story of the movie completely original: The world is on the edge of extinction in terms of the near future, there's not enough food and raw materials for all the existing inhabitants of the planet, which is becoming more and more unviable, so a solution should be found ASAP. This is the concept which has been tried to be used by many movies with more or less success in the near past. But the Interstellar (by utilizing this basic idea) could have implemented an incredibly gripping and eventful series of happenings, that cannot be paired with any other production in terms of quality for almost years back in the near past. The movie supplies the audience with a brief 3 hours runtime, but I haven't been being befriended by the feeling of when will it be over.' The film pushes twists and new facts right after each other into the face of the audience, but I cannot declare any of them as a cliché.This is the only point I could pick a quarrel. I have catastrophically scant astronomical knowledge, so there were some things in the movie, that I cannot take in completely even now after a long period of thinking hard. Maybe I'm a little weak-minded or my modest proficiency in the subject could be a potential reason for that, I think this movie is far more enjoyable for hardcore sci-fi fans than the remaining portion of the audience. But even with the possession of a little ignorance I can this production a great movie! It's speedy, able to engage the attention of the audience, and it has the amazing ability of generating massive curiosity among the people, so the viewer cannot sit calm till the end while waiting for the outcome (which is brilliant!).I don't care if many other people will consider me a little g*y, But I haven't seen a movie for years, which could have been able to pull out so many emotions from the people watching it. Love, understanding, devotion, compassion, sense of duty, nostalgia, and the significance of choices between alternative decisions by the characters could set a new milestone for the role-playing games. As supporting my statement I saw many people among the audience sweeping out teardrops from the corner of their eyes. And it cannot be achieved without the actors' unexceptionable performance. Sometimes the writer put the characters in extraordinary situations like keeping the skype-like' connection between a father traveling in the outer space and his children being left on the Earth, while time is passing disproportionately. These things cannot be experienced in the real life, and they are even incomprehensible enough for the audience not to be able to realize how to react. And by this we're able judge who can be described as a real actor! And I bow down deeply with respect in front of the whole crew.Genereally speaking, I'm not totally eased with all the female actors. Both actresses, whose characters represent the weaker gender of the main characters were so distasteful for me, that I could've punch them on the face every time they appeared on the silver screen. For a while, it totally seemed that we got two women just to overload emotions in the male characters and their only role is to restrict the main thread of the story. However, by the end of the film I've completely changed my mind about them, and they've become quite likable characters for me. In addition, the story could not have been finished without them, so their existence was extremely important in terms of the plot. Bonus: I've never thought that there will ever be a movie, in which one of my favorite characters will not be a flesh-and-blood human, but a robot. I especially liked that they didn't hyped over the physical design of the machine, instead it's got real personality. So this piece of metal became a perfect companion for the astronauts, who occasionally had really amusing comments.The visuals could be compared to Gravity. But in this case not the visual i the focal point of the movie, because it has been build around a fantastic story enhanced with mountains of epic dramatic scenes. In addition, they've managed to choreograph them so effectively that all the tension has come through the screen hitting the audience with vengeance.The sound was cool, the silence and noise of the cosmic space were totally correct. And there is not too much I can add to the music. It wasn't too creative, but it was totally well-fitted into the environment and the scenes, was able to enhance the voltage or even the joyful moments.Overall, the movie is great, one of the best I've seen this year! It's outstanding within its own category. It's a must see for sci-fi fans!Last thought: if the Gravity won 7 Oscars last year, then this one should be nominated at least for the best director, best screenplay, best visual and sound effects (maybe best actor in a leading role- Matthew McConaughey).Rating 9/10",9,1,5,7 November 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air.'
","The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air.'This is the memorable quote by Galadriel introducing the movie. Honestly, I was in the age of 9 when I could have convinced my parents with the help of my cousins to take us to the theater to experience this marvelous creation of the mighty director bearing the name Peter Jackson. Above all, I need to clarify that this movie is not perfect. I've never (and nobody has ever) met a movie, which can be considered faultless. Everybody has to admit the fact, that even if we're biased toward our favorite movies, they also have more or less mistakes. But we tend to just simply pass over them. In the case of this movie they have made some mistakes in the adaptation process, sometimes it could became painfully sluggish and depressed, it's runtime is so, that the movie is independently able to create the concept of never-ending'.BUT! Despite of these small errors', declaring, that the magnificent and spectacular moments, the deeply philosophical quotes, the inimitable acting performance, the immersive and mind- blowing music composing, the stunning and dazzling visual effects are inappropriate, that is an epic mistake! Peter Jackson completed his quest, and thus could have set a standard by which future movies should be judged and rated.The story takes place in the magical realm of Middle-Earth created by J. R. R. Tolkien. We can witness how a meek hobbit of The Shire sets out on a perilous journey in the company of his gardener and two of his friends, and how he accepts his fate about facing a world destroyer evil, Sauron, The Deceiver.I can't describe how fantastic the story is. Tolkien could professionally narrate you a true and touching tale about friendship, cohesion, loyalty, honor, treachery, forgiveness, malice and goodness. All of these attributes and feelings can recognized in different scenes of the movie. They are illustrated by deed of the actors, the soundtracks, the locations and quotes or simple words. This movie represents that if you are small and tiny, you still can become stronger, but in order to that you have to survive many physical and mental trials without fatigue and abdication of your responsibilities. You can find every precious sentimental human values when you watch over the trilogy, and they perfectly spread among the different fictional races. And the way of how Tolkien stirred and mixed these values in his fairy tale, that was the thing, which enabled him to successfully accomplish the creation of one of the worlds greatest and most epic drama story.But besides philosophy and theories, there are many other intrinsic values that can be perceptible by everyone! 1) The visuals. The quality of the image through the whole movie in mind-blowing! They put so many CGI in the film, but they do in a perfect way, so that I haven't grabbed me out of the movie. I could have totally take the 3,5 hours seriously, because the effects were not over-hyped and over-saturated by preposterous and unnatural colors. They were smooth and soft, but well-designed down to the tiniest details. They filmed most of the motion picture in real, existing locations of New Zealand, and they only filled the empty spaced with some monument or ruins of old destroyed castles. The overall visual design of Middle-Earth was so realistic and lifelike.2) The performance. All the actors made a remarkable job during the filming. They killed their characters from the beginning till the end. In my opinion, choosing an adequate actor for the role of Aragorn was one of the most critical point of the organization of the whole crew. This character is a major icon of the history of Middle- Earth. But Viggo Mortensen has made the best out of himself, so no worries! Ian McKellen visualized Gandalf in a legendary way. Every time I saw his character, ha reminds me Gandalf and Dumbledore at all. So he made Gandalf not just A Wizzard, but THE Wizzard. Elijah Wood's performance was also surprisingly great. I didn't have too much expectations about that, so I was pleasantly surprised. He could totally integrate Frodo's mental and physical development into his character. 10 points for the Hobbits.3) The sound & music. All hail to Howard Shore. Since the old, original Star Wars trilogy it has never even crossed my mind, that I would ever experience the I was chilled to my bones' effect on myself. But the soundtrack is simply magnificent in this movie. Every time I can hear the pure melody, I feel myself being taken to Middle-Earth on the wings the epic music. All the original score is almost beyond epic totally fits the actual occasion happening on the screen. The other sounds are also flawlessly edited. The screeching of the nazguls is still can terrify me even today.4) The adaptation. I admit that some essential elements and characters were left out of movie, and the story was altered somewhere, but despite of that you can't judge the movie, because it still perfectly bring Middle-Earth to life before our eyes, which is totally the same what you can build up in your mind out of the raw material gained from Tolkien's book. Peter Jackson had to visualize a whole universe, and he managed to succeed. You can find many tiny details in the movie that you can also find in the thick book while seeking through the lines. And this is the key thing, that makes the movie so charming for the true fans, so that it would give your hearth a warm hug.This is the movie of my life! When it came out, it just simply hit the screen with true vengeance.Thanks for spending your precious free time with reading my review! Hope you liked it!",10,2,2,26 September 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A surprisingly pleasant X-perience!
","First of all, I need to clarify, that I barely able to watch any Marvel movie. Not because consider them bad. No! Not at all! All of them are high quality productions of the Hollywood film factory. Despite of that I've seen all the X-Men movies so far, and after watching the First Class I couldn't wait for this one. And it totally worthed it!The story is well-presented, I was fairly delighted with the whole time-traveling idea. Although there were some loops in it, but I do not want to mention them for now. The acting performance is can said to be almost beyond compare, apart from a few exceptions. Magneto was great and almighty, Mystic was graceful and sexy as hell, Wolverine was pure Wolverine, etcetera, etcetera. We had the honorable opportunity to meet with quicksilver, who I bet is gonna be the favorite character of everybody. He was cool and hilarious, and you would want to spend more and more time with watching him in real- time' action.Michael Fassbender just became eligible enough to get a goddamn Ocsar at last! He's just killed his character! Magneto has almost never been so original than this time! I think I'm gonna sit down and write an anthem for him after I finished my review.The visuals boosted with 3D were phenomenal. Especially I've fallen in love with the chick with teleportation ability. That just has made the action sequences simply so creative and cool! The robots were also well-designed and bad-ass, and this is the movie, in which cannot see a little drop of blood, but the fighting scenes create a so brutal atmosphere, that it could almost hurt us, when we can witness a character's death. The robots are tearing the mutants into pieces and beating the s**t out of them with no mercy. The five minutes long introducing scene was almost smashed my 3D glasses. So the visuals are absolutely great, and they can make us feel the tension and pressure on our shoulders, what the mutants are bearing too.Is this movie faultless? Nope! One of my main problem was Wolverine, sorry folks! We can him on screen far more than any other (more important) characters, and most of the time he didn't do anything special. I don't understand why the makers of the movie wanted to sell their product to us with Wolverine. They could have done him without him too. This man didn't managed to make any successful conversation, and I felt that his only role was to show his abs and unrealistically aesthetic body in the first half of the movie, because Jackman has never been ripped as hard as now. The dialogs are painfully simple, and movie gets started slightly sluggishly because of that. But it's only a really tiny mistake.Mystic! She is so attractive and charming, but that's the problem. She was put right into the focal point of the movie, but the primal purpose was to show her naturally elegant physique, so aesthetics again. I bet the male members of the audience cannot take in what really happens when she is on the screen, because the sight of her naked blue body and her extremely cool and jaunty fighting moves. I consider it another tiny mistake, but I must admit that I totally loved it!  Mystics other mistake is that she could be easily manipulated. Her decisions are hardly influenced by the decisions of the other male characters. But why? She could have been a separately intelligent character, who can take things in her hands and manage them effectively.Despite of the mistakes in the characters, the movie manages them very well. I mean that every character has its own personality, own purpose, own beliefs, which are varying from one to another. And this the secret of the perfect editing! There are several female and male characters, but we cannot consider any of them evil or good. The movie provides the option for each individual member of audience to personally choose who he/she wants to be the good guy and who to be bad guy. All characters are fighting for his/her noble goal, and I've changed my side severally during the story.Overall, this movie is epic and MARVELOUS! The music composition was excellent, totally fitted into the environment. The humorous moments were hilarious, the fighting moments were savage and cruel, the sentimental moments were emotional enough. So almost every details were appropriately accomplished. All my respect for the crew!Thanks for spending your precious free time with reading my review! Hope you liked it!",8,4,6,29 September 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Rule the dragons again!
","Watching an animation movie in the cinema is always a challenge. It's always difficult to get my friends to sit in the theater, because there is a widespread misconception among people nowadays that these movies are especially made for children. But this is not true of course. For example if we put all the Pixar movies or some productions by Dreamworks and Disney under the microscope, than we can certainly say (even with the eyes an adult) that we really liked that!The situation is the same with How to train your dragon 2. At first glance the movie might seems to has been made for children under the age of 12. Buti f we are determined about watching the whole thing, we could certainly realize that plentiful adult content is stuffed in it too. Fortunately the movie doesn't try to feed us with the so over-hyped, usual and stereotypical love conquers all' slogan. Instead of that, it tries to put other basic and important human values at the canter, such as the significance of unity, cooperation vs betrayal, ties of friendship, belonging somewhere, how to convince an other man about your opinion by the arguments of reason, etc. The particular strengths of the film, is that these things are never been said directly by any character, we can sense the hidden massages by their actions and dialogues. So the movie was not made for a specific age group, but it has the ability to target all the consumers, regardless of age. Both children and adults would definitely find their own little favorite and lovable moments. The film is a perfect sequel of the first part. Even the opening scene stars the movie very pleasantly: Hiccup riding his dragon equipped with its mechanic device (in order to be able to being controlled) meanwhile they discovering more an more new areas where they haven't had the opportunity to get before (without dragons). For me it had a little funny effect, that all the vikings take piggyback rides on their own dragons, but the animations have been drawn so nicely and accurately, that the sight was absolutely said to be correct and acceptable. Let's speaking of sight! The imagery of the film is fantastic! In today's world, when almost every little need of the consumers are satisfied to the extent, that put their threshold almost above the clouds, it difficult to show them something on which their eyes can stuck. However, in this film the wonderful landscapes, beautifully created characters, the creatively choreographed flying scenes are each tore my chin down to the ground. It was a long time ago that an animated film has been able to take such an advantage of the technology, which it was made from.The first part of the movie in 2010 has become one of my favorite animated movie, that made me very curious about the sequel. Has it worthed waiting for so long? I can not really decide. The film is excellent as a sequel, perfectly continues the main elements of the first one. Those who haven't seen the first part, won't be able to understand all the essence of the interaction between the characters. But if we talking about characters, I must mention one thing: personally I couldn't wait to see Hiccup's next adventure, that how he will pick up the fight against the majority's will, what further discussions he'll has to take with his father, and what kind of further relationship he will keep with the other youngsters, who we got to know from the first movie. But unfortunately I had the feeling that they've tried to make the movie so monumental, that the characters have become a bit superficially developed. Hiccup and his father were the focal point of the first movie along with the night-fury of course. Here, however, the characters in the supporting roles were somehow more interesting for me. For example, I loved listening to our pudgy friend as he was saying all the nerd things about the beasts, or as the other kid was always being about saying or doing something bad-ass in order to impress one of the female members of the crew. But Hiccup wasn't so engrossing character like in the first movie, pity for himSomehow I couldn't really care about the villain of the movie either as a I should have. We get a brief background story about why he's become so evil, but somehow he just seemed so impersonal to me. He doesn't have any engrossing feature, that could have drawn my attention to him, because he just has kept yelling and shouting and waving a stick with his thick arm.I had a bit deja vu feeling by the prospect of the colossus dragon (called the alpha). But when an other one climbed to the screen from the depth of the villain's army, than I just sat in the theater totally confused. Why they wanted to copy this element so violently from the first movie? This was not one of the great features why so many people has become infatuated with the prequel. Maybe I'm the only one who sees it as a problem, but I didn't really like that huge bastard in the first movie either (I don't know why).Overall, the film is able to provide great fun for everyone, and your age doesn't matter! It has some funny parts, serious points of interest, sentimental scenes, and all of these are spiced with great imaginary. For me it was not as great experience as its predecessor, but nevertheless i't gifted me with a really good 1,5 hour.Rating 7/10",7,1,4,21 October 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Tom Cruise in the role of a more or less qualified space marine.
","The film wasn't promoted and over-hyped by armies of high profile and fierce marketing campaigns, so I belatedly noticed its only existence. When I first glimpsed the official poster of the movie, it somehow failed to arouse my interest, because by the sight of the two actors posing in the futuristic uniform the first thing which came into mind was that we got the concept of another silly game adaptation, which happened to be Warhammer 40K at this time.However, over time I realized that the film has nothing to do with the game even despite of the space marine style uniforms. I've started looking after the things and I've conducted a little investigation, but finally I managed to find only a brief and condensed information about the plot. I became eager for more details so I had to sit in the theater stuffed with curiosity. And there came a huge and pleasant surprise!Thanks to the unique and original story, the splendiferous acting performance, the fantastically choreographed action sequences, the not overacted and exaggerating humor, and many other positive things, the only sentence came into my mind was that I'd watch it again, and repeat, and again!'I don't wanna give you spoilers about the story, so the only thing I can say, that I consider it really unique. The Live, die, repeat!' slogan does not provide too much information about the whole thing to prospective audience, but it's quite enough to throw a spoonful morsel to you, which you can chew on until you gather adequate amount of curiosity to get yourself committed about watching the whole movie.Let's examine the characters under the microscope. The film could be enjoyable for those who are infatuated with Tom Cruise, and for those who loathe him either, as he gets killed countless times in a row on the battlefield. The characters go through a real development, which was build up properly. We could witness how a weak, scared, left- handed wuss officer become a brave, dauntless and almost fearless butcher, who grinds and slashes the enemy easily with joy. Emily Blunt perfectly embodies the cool and absolutely bad-ass female protagonist, what she could implement in a so unique and amazing way, that it does not gives us the concept of the typical, phlegmatic, annoying, empty-headed, though chick who can humiliate every male characters in the movie with ease. Instead of that we could recognize a real amazon warrior woman while seeing her acting performance. Let's face it guys, that this has been achieved by hardly any women so far! And Bill Paxton magnificently shows us his priceless talent while bringing cynical leader into life. It's a great pleasure to watch!The battle scenes are totally mind-blowing! You scarcely can see a drop of blood on the canvas throughout the entire movie, but nevertheless the movie throws some so brutally created action scenes right front of our eyes, that we can almost feel the shooting pain in our limbs when we see a character getting injured. I watch the first landing with opened mouth, without taking a small breath, when Tom Criuse has been first dropped right into the middle of the battle. It was almost scary to watch soldiers falling sequentially like little flies.The film is a spectacular, high quality, and moreover it's an intelligent blockbuster, which can be considered a true rarity these days. In my point of view this movie earned the honorable title of The Movie of the Year'. Everyone should see this masterpiece!Thanks for spending your precious free time with reading my review! Hope you liked it!",10,1,4,28 September 2014
Furious 7," Furious for the 7th time!
","Furious 7. This was one of the blockbusters of 2015, in which I was at least interested in. However, I love the full cast, the entire crew, and the name of the director was also really promising for me. In addition, I have had the chance to see a favorite Asain actor of mine, namely Tony Jaa in a Hollywood flick.Although, all these news are encouraged me to watch this movie, the final outcome was disappointing for me once again. Starting out with the pros, the movie was really well-directed! I raise my hat before the director and the producers (and stunts of course) because the entire movie is well-edited. It is stuffed with a lot of actions, which are rhythmically followed by some more sluggish dramatic scenes, which are really required here IMO. However, the playtime counts more than 2 hours, you won't feel bored for a single minute, and this is what I call an achievement! The acting performance and the chemistry between the actors are still awesome. Just like in the prequels, Vin Diesel is calm and serious at the same time, Paul Walker is the cop, who rarely shows his emotions factually, but still effective, there's Letty, who still struggles with her memory, but we could see a quite good character development in her case, and yep, there's Roman, who still has some hilarious moments. The movie manages the balance between threads of the previous installments in order to entwine them with the current state of the storyline.Unfortunately, the other members of the crew are a little bit pushed in the background. I would have liked to see more of Tej, and especially Hobbes! However, he was more than bad-ass in his moments, but this cannot be compared to the badassness of Jason Statham, which was more than exaggeration. I do not wanna spoiler those moments, but the way he is sleazy and though at the same time was quite ridiculous for me to take him seriously enough. And the same goes for the action sequences. There were too much over-hyped, close to impossible scenes, which was not attributable to the first few installments of the franchise. The abundance of slow-motions, explosions, gunshots and flying cars were torn me out of the movie and made me an outsider, who was just sitting in the theatre with huge eyes without believing what is really happening n the silver- screen.All of this would have been excusable for my part if I have seen any trace of an illegal race! Honestly, there were quite a few moments in the movie, where I actually felt from the signs made by Dom, that there could be something like what I mentioned. But it was only a hope, unfortunately. The old, good feeling of the streets has been transformed into an action-packed moneybag franchise by Hollywood.In summary, this was an average action movie for me. I would recommend it if you wish to pump up your adrenaline level, do not care about reality, wanna enjoy few humorous quotes and see, how the story goes on with the Toretto family. Buti f your desire is to receive something of the old times, then you will be disappointed, because is has long-disappeared.My final rating is 5/10. Thanks for reading!",5,2,25,19 January 2016
