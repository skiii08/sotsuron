The Blair Witch Project," Good Plot but induces travel sickness.
","The Blair Witch Project includes one of the most interesting plots for any horror movie. Three students are investigating the legend of the Blair Witch. This movie is meant to be the film that they recorded while investigating.The movie was recorded on a home video recorder and the screen shakes a lot. This helps to give the feeling that you are seeing the actual film the students took with them on their project. Unfortunately, it made friends get headaches and even slight bouts of travel sickness.However, their are many positive points about the movie. The acting is superb and the terror and horror of the situation can be felt throughout by the viewer, mostly without violence.Although I did not enjoy watching this movie very much, it is worthwhile watching; even to only hear about the legend of the Blair Witch. Watch the film with low expectations while ignoring the hype and you will enjoy it.",4,0,1,18 December 1999
That Thing You Do!," A fantastic 'feel good' movie.
","That Thing You Do! is one of the most enjoyable films I have seen. The plot is based on the successes and failures of an American band in the 1960's. It includes great music, good acting efforts and a realistic script. The film is a 'feel good' movie, sure to make you smile. I recommend that everyone should see this film.",8,0,0,20 December 1999
