Skyfall," Amongst the very best of Bond
","Bond fans can heave a sigh of relief. The franchisee is in safe hands with Sam Mendes and the redoubtable Daniel Craig. Bond no. 23 (Skyfall) for most parts works like a charm. Its beauty lying in the deft directorial touches from director Mendes and ably supported by master actors like Judie Dench and Javier Bardem. Bardem is slimy, memorable, deranged, grand, dramatic, homo-erotic and frighteningly off his rocker as the wrecker in chief, Silva. Silva is an honorable entry in the rogue's gallery of Bond's nemeses. Bardem pulls off the act well, never letting it get out of control. Director Sam Mendes clearly is a Bond fan what with many references to previous Bond films cleverly inserted here and there. Mendes also is high on symbolism. We see a crook in a cop's uniform running helter skelter to save his skin, the two 'rats' scampering through underground drainage like real rats would, court proceedings being brought to halt by some instant justice meted out and of course the final denouement in the house of Lord.Mendes has also tried to be crowd pleaser with a new, young, freshly scrubbed Quartermaster (Q) and Ms MoneyPenny, obligatory love making scenes plus the new eye candy Bond girl (Bérénice Marlohe). But thankfully he doesn't try too hard. A word must be mentioned of Roger Deakin, the staple cinematographer of Mendes' films. He lends a refreshingly beautiful, majestic and picturesque touch to the locations and proceedings.The film opens with a crackerjack of an opening action sequence which grabs you by the seat of your pants and doesn't let go of it till Adele belts out her haunting and memorable theme number.So how does Skyfall stack up against other Bond movies? Well, my answer is that it is good enough to be counted amongst the top 5. A job well done Agent 007. I am going with 3.5 stars on 5.",8,1,9,1 November 2012
Gravity," Gravity Sucks!
","'Life in space is impossible'Acclaimed Director Alfonso Cuaron's much appreciated and raved about 'Gravity' opens with these 5 words . Ironically, Cuaron goes on to prove that even with a master like him at the helm, it is possible to make a substandard film.It is shocking that Cuaron who is usually known for his memorable characters and gritty portrayal of human relationships has come up with such a marginal script (co scripted with son Jonas) and absolutely no gripping characters.Sample this - Sandra Bullock's Dr Ryan Stone is the last person who deserves to be on any mission forget a critical space mission. Given that she is prone to panic attacks and her first reaction to any situation is negative, chaotic and that of hopelessness. At worst, Dr Stone is a nervous wreck and at best she is following orders without questioning. Old Jungle saying – if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. What in the name of Prometheus is Dr Stone doing in space? Watching Dr Ryan Stone fumble her way through space made me instantly crave for Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) from 'Alien'.George Clooney's mission commander Matt Kowalsky is well, George Clooney, throwing his one liners with panache and being the gorgeous, sexy , funny counterfoil to dim witted, slow and helpless Sandra Bullock.Background score from Steven Price makes sure that we all know in advance when a perilous event is just waiting to happen. Price overwhelms us with the music, instead of intelligently using the loneliness, the vacuum and the deafening silence of space at crucial moments in the movie.With such one-dimensional characters and predictable linear storytelling, Director Alfonso Cuaron's salvation comes from fellow Mexican, old partner and Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki Morgenstern (The Tree of Life, Children of Men, Sleepy Hollow) who shows us in all its glory and fright what it must be to float in space. This is as real as any of us ordinary mortals can come to experiencing space first hand. Lubezki is the shining star of this space misadventure. And it is for his contribution mostly that I award 'Gravity', 7 out of 10. Otherwise, Alfonso Cuaron's 'Gravity' mostly just sucks.My top 3 space movies continue to be '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Contact' and 'Apollo 13'.",7,6,12,12 October 2013
American Hustle," Side Shows intended to take your attention away from many inherent flaws.
","What do you get when you put together accomplished actors like Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Renner and Robert De Niro? Answer – Not much.OK, another one. What do you get when you throw together Directors like Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and Wes Anderson? Answer Forgettablefellas oops I mean 'American Hustle', broadly speaking a poor imitation of 'Goodfellas'.Based on the mostly true details (there is a disclaimer to that exact effect, right at the beginning of the movie) of the well known ABSCAM case of late 70's, Director David O. Russell picks up actors from his previous movies (The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook) and also brings in Robert De Niro for a quick cameo appearance but fails to recreate any of the past magic. It is evident that Russell is heavily influenced by fast talking, profanity spewing, dysfunctional and flawed con men/women characters of Scorsese, Ritchie and Tarantino. The movie does have the scope of being ambitious, fun, entertaining, smart, darkly comic, sophisticated adult fare however it fails to live up to the hype and expectations because at the core of the movie is a weak and crumbly script. The narrative is uniformly murky and poorly paced, even incoherent at times.So what does Russell do? To keep the audience engaged he indulges in amateurish and pointless distractions (Jennifer Lawrence doing a cringe worthy imitation of Wing's rendition of 'Live and Let Die' and many such examples.) I would love to see J Law appear in a musical in near future. Talking about the music score, there are many little gems here – Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Santana's Evil Ways, Led Zeppelin's What is and what should never be, Killer Papa was a rolling stone and others.But soon the viewer realizes that the movie is deliberately trying to distract you (garish costume, smelly nail polish, boob show necklines, fake accents, over the top hair-do's, side stories et al) as it has very little to offer you by way of substance. But to give credit where it is due, Russell keeps the movie visually engaging what with overall production design, coiffure hairstyles, garish costumes and some funky 70's music.However, what truly stands out in the movie is its two lead female characters – Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence. Both are absolutely glorious, conniving, terrifying, manipulative, sexy and spectacular all the way. Adams has an edge over Lawrence. While regrettably, Lawrence does not get enough screen time, Adams' is a more nuanced character with a lot more screen time. Adams takes her character and does magic with it infusing it with flesh, charm, vulnerability and her own personal touch. 'American Hustle' is owned by Amy Adams. This is probably her best performance ever. Amy Adams is definitely the front runner for Academy Award for Best Actress (at the time of writing this review she had already picked up a Golden Globe). While 'American Hustle' disappoints sorely from a story, script and direction point of view it still managed to hold my attention on the basis of its entertaining characters and its visually appealing look and feel.",6,3,6,15 January 2014
Man of Steel," No Cape of Good Hope
","'Man of Steel' does not redefine the superman franchisee like Chris Nolan's Dark Knight series did for Batman. The Krypton origin back story of Superman is unfortunately pretty tame and does not define him for what he went on to become on Earth. Director Zack Snyder (he of the flops 'Sucker Punch', Dawn of the Dead' fame) and co producer/co writer Chris Nolan try and add new elements to Superman's character like edginess, violence, grimness, grittiness but the end result is still pedestrian. Nolan, in fact, tries to do a Batman to Superman but fails spectacularly. First half of the movie shows some potential but the second half is just an excruciatingly boring slug fest of explosions, fights, clashes, crashes, flying, tumbling, falling etc. We have seen it all in umpteen movies before. 'Man of Steel' has nothing new to offer in the 2nd half. It gets so tiresome that the viewer needs to have nerves of steel to sit though the entire second half. Whatever little Snyder managed to build up in the pre-interval phase, he destroys it in the last 45 minutes of mind numbing action.As for the lead actor, Henry Cavill, he certainly looks the part but his granite face remains just that (stiff and stony) for the better part of the movie. Cavill is definitely an improvement on Brandon Routh of 'Superman Returns' but Christopher Reeve still remain the actor the role continues to be identified with. Even though the rest of the star cast comprises of such acting heavy weights like Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and Amy Adams, the movie remains distinctly underwhelming on the emoting front thanks to their characters being sketchily conceived. In the end 'Man of Steel' is neither style nor substance. The movie must rank as this summer's biggest disappointment. 'Man of Steel' is just an expensive, soul less, dumb, long drawn and lazy spectacle. And in my book that is worth only 2 out of 5 stars. PS - True blue Superman comic fans will never forgive Zack Snyder for killing off Costner's character in a way which is absolutely different from what happens in the comic and therefore taking off all the significance of that event.",4,4,8,15 June 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Clichés at every turn in this oddball town
","Silver Linings Playbook' was a must watch movie on my wish list after it picked up 8 Oscar nominations (not to mention that it stars one of my all time favorite, Robert De Niro) this year. Not only it has cornered all the big nominations this year, SLP is the only movie since 'Reds' in 1981 to pick up all the 4 acting nods (Best Actor/Actress, Best Supporting Actor/Actress). With so much going for it, its natural for the viewer to expect something out of the ordinary. Alas, the only thing not 'ordinary' about the movie is that it revolves around a bunch of 'abnormal' people.By way of story, SLP is about Bradley Cooper's character, who suffers from Bipolar Disorder, and his tryst with all the other neurotic, obsessive compulsive, dysfunctional, superstitious people and other plain weirdos that he encounters with alarming regularity in the tiny little town he resides in. Based on ex high school teacher Matthew Quick's eponymous novel, SLP neither turns out to be a screw ball, irreverent comedy (something like 'Crazy People'), nor is it a feel good, heart warming tale (like 'Forrest Gump') or not even an accurate depiction of the real life situations of bipolar people (remember Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn in 'Lust for Life'). So what is SLP all about? I don't really know and neither does the Director David O Russell. He tries hard to make SLP a rom-com, a comedy, a quirky fun film, a family drama, a feel good film about the proverbial under dog, but eventually ends up with a mish-mash tasting more like yesterday's stale left overs.The only silver lining of this largely forgettable effort is an assured, confident and bravura performance from its lead actor, Bradley Cooper. Cooper is the tour de force here reminding us that he is meant for bigger and better things than inane movies like 'The Hangover'. His performance is truly worthy of an Oscar nomination. Other members of the cast, including De Niro, Chris Tucker and Jennifer Lawrence, are at best adequate and at worst over the top, hamming impresarios.My recommendation to evolved movie viewers is to skip this playbook and go watch a re-run of 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest' or 'A Beautiful Mind' if oddball characters are your preferred choice of viewing this weekend.",5,3,7,22 February 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Morally ambivalent product from a lazy director
","Kathryn Bigelow who made history by becoming the first woman director to win an Oscar ('The Hurt Locker') continues her tryst with 9/11 and its aftermath with her latest creation - Zero Dark Thirty.ZDT like its predecessor, 'The Hurt Locker', chronicles the polarization of the world from an American standpoint. To the credit of the director, she manages to build in a fair amount of suspense and edge of the seat thrills as the hunt for Osama Bin Laden reaches its crescendo, despite the end result being known to the viewer.The other high light of the movie is the portrayal of Maya, the lead CIA operative by upcoming actress Jessica Chastain. Its rare to see a mainstream Hollywood movie where the lead female actor is shown as cold, bull headed, steely, self centered and socially inept. Chastain pulls it off remarkably well. What a transformation it has been for the classically beautiful actress from playing vulnerable, quiet, mother of two in 'The Tree of Life' or from playing the air headed, rich, bored housewife who wants to desperately hire a house maid and impress her husband in 'The Help'. Slowly but surely, Chastain is building up a formidable oeuvre of work. No wonder she is bookies favorite to pick up the Best Actress Oscar this year.On the acting front, an honorable mention must be made of James Gandolfini's robust, business like and heavy duty cameo of CIA Chief, Leon Panetta.Beyond these odd exceptions, the cupboard of ZDT is starkly bare. Is this movie pro/anti war? Is the movie pro/anti Jihad? Is this movie pro/anti prison torture? No one can tell. Director Bigelow takes a convenient and morally ambivalent stand on all these issues. Why is Maya so single-mindedly obsessed about hunting down OBL? What drives her to shun friends, social life and risk her own life and limbs to be devoted to the cause? Once again no one can tell. Bigelow does a shoddy job of fleshing out Maya and other characters. Also for Bigelow, the age old American policy of fostering trouble in Middle East and the resultant rise of militancy in those regions is not something to be bothered with in the narrative. Even a TV series like 'Homeland' is more comprehensive in its reach and coverage there.In summary, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a movie bogged down by a weak script, stuffed with process and operational details and helmed by a lazy director, ultimately winding up in the graveyard of many forgettable films on the topic of Islamic terrorism.I am going with 2.5 stars on 5.",6,8,15,15 February 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The Final Chapter
","To talk about 'The Dark Knight Rises' merely in super-heroic terms would be to mete out grave injustice to the movie. For this movie has great ambition, spectacle and exhilarating energy of epic proportions. This is not a folksy, cartoonish, sophomorish, campy super hero caper (which is what Hollywood has been churning out with alarming frequency) passing muster by the sheer din of a few well executed CGI scenes but a cerebral, potent, tense, disturbing yet hypnotic climactic outing which reaffirms Chris Nolan's status as the pre-eminent film maker of our times.With 'The Dark Kinght Rises', Nolan has done the well nigh impossible. He has made a trilogy in which every sequel is better than the prequel. Something that even legendary Francis Ford Coppola could not achieve with his magnum opus, 'The Godfather' series.Now to come to the 250 million dollar question, Is Bane as good as the Joker? Well, in the fearsome badman Bane, Batman seems to have finally met more than his match. Bane is terrifying, grotesque, humongous, powerful, remorseless with brains to match his brawn. However, Bane's biggest strength comes from the fact that Batman under estimates his prowess and cunning and is therefore forced to eat humble pie. Menacing Bane starts off as a populist villain promising to free the society from the inequalities brought about by evil capitalists. He also sets up a kangaroo court with 'fast track' proceedings and instant punishments (reminiscent of our own Maoists) however strangely he soon starts working at cross purposes with himself setting off a nuclear device to kill the very people he set out to liberate. In Bane, Nolan has picked out a monumental foe. Bane is jaw dropping awesome but for once the movie is about Batman/Bruce Wayne and he does manage to outshine every other character. The best part about Batman - Bane showdown is their raw, unadulterated, hand to hand mortal combat. Nolan does not hide behind some gadgety, 3D, special effects generated larger than life clash but gives the viewers a ring side view of the fight as it happens.Christian Bale is ably supported by a stellar cast where everyone is more than adequate however in the star studded galaxy 2 names shine brighter than others - Michael Caine as Alfred, the Butler and Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Caine is the emotional core of the movie, providing the much needed gravitas and old world charm. Hathaway is deliciously ambiguous as slimy yet vulnerable, neurotic yet sweet, glamorous yet dangerous cat burglar and boy she does flip those alternate personality switches with ease.However, fans of gorgeous Marion Cotillard would be justified in thinking that the French delicacy was somewhat wasted here. Hans Zimmer's music score should have been toned down a bit as it tends to get ahead of itself at times even drowning out the dialogs at a few places. There are a few loose and unexplained ends in the movie but in the overall scheme and grandness of things I would dare not say that it matters. In the finality of things, the man who emerges as the true super hero, the one who deserves a standing applause is the British White Knight, Director Chris Nolan. Nolan is courageous and competent enough to raise the stakes to astronomical levels and deliver the final product with aplomb. This is masterful film making at its mercilessly brilliant best. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is a fitting finale, a final show down, a final pay off which leaves you desperately asking for more. I am going with 4 stars on 5.",9,3,8,21 July 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Refreshing, Entertaining, Delightful - Wes Anderson in top form here.
","'Moonrise Kingdom' is a signature Wes Anderson movie. In look and feel, it comes quite close to his earlier work, 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. However, at times I was also reminded of 'Submarine' that wonderfully precocious work from British director Richard Ayoade where a 15 year old's sole objective is to lose his virginity before his next birthday.'Moonrise Kingdom' is strewn with classic Anderson characters; troubled but endearingly flawed adults, dysfunctional but intelligent kids (not the irritatingly faux cute Bollywood variety), poignant portrayals of wealthy and working class people generously infused with wry, dry humor. Overall a charming mix of quirk and cool. No scope for melodrama here.The highlight of Anderson movies as with 'Moonrise Kingdom' is cinematography, background score and restrained acting. Each scene shot by Robert Yeoman is elegantly composed and aesthetically shot, mostly in primary colors. Alexandre Desplat's original background score mixes folk music, classic and rock seamlessly. Viewers also get a crash course in music appreciation during the opening and closing scenes of the movie.Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward (a very tempting mix of Emma Watson and Kristen Stewart) in the leading role of 12 year olds madly in love with each other are completely believable. Ensemble cast of Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDoirmand, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel and Jason Schwartzman complete the list of oddballs, weirdos, wackos and misfits inhabiting the fragile world of adolescents.So go right ahead and immerse yourself and you would come out refreshed, provoked, moved, entertained and delighted. I guarantee that.",7,0,3,23 September 2012
