Scarface," 2019
","I watched today on Netflix , so probably the context it's different in 2019 then back in 1983 but i can't take this movie seriously . So many unbelievable plot points , the whole movie is set in a town where basically no police no law enforcement , they can kill the boss , and virtually kidnap his wife , and the next day she is Pacino's girlfriend and everything is fine , no questioning from nobody , because everything is happening in there gangster world where just no police :) . And so on . The acting from Pacino is not that great but only in retrospective , back in 2019 :) . All the other actors are terrible including Michelle Pfeiffer .",3,2,3,30 December 2019
Knives Out," Not very credible
","Yes it is with full of twists , and very good screenplay , good directory , but it's just one big plot hole : why , why Harlan acts like this ? I mean common , he give his all the money to Marta , and then he just commit suicide just to save her for an apparent murder ? In the screenplay we didn't find anything out of ordinary about Harlan and Marta , yes she was good to him , yes he respected her but common it's just a little too much that a healthy old men when he finds out that he was poisoned (apparently) he's first reaction not the call 991 , or try to vomit or whatever , but kills himself just to save Marta ..",6,1,3,3 April 2020
