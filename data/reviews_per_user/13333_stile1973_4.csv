The Mask," Clichéd but solid entertainment
","The spirit of the Norse god of mischief Loki is trapped inside a green wooden mask, and anyone donning the mask during nightime unleashes that spirit and obtains vast powers. It also brings out the deep inner repressed character of a person, be it for good or for evil. For the character of Stanley Ipkiss, the deep inner self is a collage of old movies and cartoons with the soul of a hopeless romantic thrown in for good measure.The idea of the Mask is a unique story idea, and it provides the perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey to act out his palette of comic abilities.Unfortunately the story is also riddled with clichés: the loser male figure defeats the villain, becomes the hero and wins the girl, the cop is bumbling and uptight, the one-dimensional crime-lord is pure evil, and so on.But one can forgive the clichés and get lost in the pure spectacle that is Jim Carrey doing his thing. It is hard to envision this film having been successful without Carrey as the lead. Cameron Diaz also puts in a respectable performance as the love interest in this career launching endeavour.While it's no cinematic masterpiece, the Mask is fun and highly entertaining. I would like to see more from story creators Michael Fallon and Mark Verheiden.",8,0,0,16 January 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Flawless
","Take the perfect dysfunctional family and put them on a road trip together from Albuquerque to California. What is the result? All the characters in this outstanding film are beautifully sculpted by the hand of a master artist - and that includes everyone from writer to actor to editor.In general, the characters have depth and three-dimensions and each undergoes a very clear and definite arc within the film. The family as a whole also undergoes a deeply comical and emotionally satisfying arc.Michael Arndt is a hugely talented writer, and I expect that we will see more from him in the coming years (at least I hope so). He has the ability to coax story out of the most trivial situation and spellbind the audience in the process.I also hope to see more from Abigail Breslin (Olive) who plays the charming and highly likable Little Miss Sunshine contestant. But the whole cast deserves credit for exceptional performances all around, from the suicidal Proust scholar (Uncle Frank) played by Steve Carell to the gruff but loving grandfather played by Alan Arkin.This film should be required viewing for those hoping to enter the business and it easily takes my vote for the best film of 2006.",10,2,5,13 January 2007
The Departed," Outstanding
","The story is centered around the life of Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) who is working as an undercover police detective infiltrating the organization run by Frank Costello (Nicholson). The plot is complicated by the fact that Colin Sullivan (Damon) is a mole in the police department tipping off Costello and preventing the big bust from happening. Tensions build as Billy and Colin try to discover the identity of one another, and both sides discover that there is a rat/mole working in the respective organizations but unsure of who it is.The screenplay is top notch and deserves an Oscar nod. The performances are outstanding all around and I was especially impressed with DiCaprio who plays his character with a nice blend of toughness and vulnerability. Excellent direction by Scorsese - who has shown time and time again that he knows how to tell an outstanding crime story.The only drawback for me was the ending - for me it was a double surprise ending but I wanted something a little more emotionally and intellectually satisfying.Overall I highly recommend this film. One of the best pictures of 2006 for sure.",8,1,2,28 January 2007
Bruce Almighty," Very good God spoof
","Plot summary: the plot is fairly simple - Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) finds his life in the gutter, but for some reason God (played by Morgan Freeman) decides to give Bruce His powers for a while to see how difficult it actually is to be God.Comments: The movie is perfectly cast - Carrey, Freeman, Steve Carell, Jennifer Aniston, and Catherine Bell are all perfect in their roles. Steve Carell shows his comic genius during the anchor scene, which you have to see to appreciate. Jim Carrey is also an incredible comic actor, regardless of the bad press that he receives, I think he is a talented and diverse actor with extraordinary comic range. The story idea is original and well constructed, although slightly predictable at times. It also suffers from a lack of an exploration of God's powers and His role in the world - there was a great deal more that could have been done with this idea.Overall an entertaining and highly watchable film. Worth checking out if you haven't seen it yet.",7,0,2,1 February 2007
