The Legend of Bagger Vance," Excellent example of what a movie can be.
","In this stirring movie director Robert Redford shows what can be done without 'in your face' language, violence, or sex. What he created is a movie that stirs, challenges, inspires, and creates awe in the viewer. The movie reinvigorates appreciation for lost values, fighting for one's country, adversity in terrible situations, honesty, and appreciation for other people's abilities and contributions. The movie is cinematically lush, the sound track is appropriate but not intrusive, the language fits the situation, and the actors are at the top of their art. I saw this movie twice in one evening and my interest was held at each viewing. Thumbs up to Director Redford, Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Matt Damon for cinematography at it's best. My only reason for a 9 instead of a 10 is some aspects of the story line were not sufficiently explored but this is due to length constraints. Furthermore the lack does not detract from the movie but rather would have added to the movie's impact.",9,0,1,11 November 2000
50 First Dates," Throughly enjoyed
","My wife and I went to see this movie being Adam Sandler fans. We thought this was a great vehicle for Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. The movie had everything - drama, comedy, suspense, romance. We also enjoyed that it espoused family values. Even though Ula (Rob Schneider) had a warped sense of love for his family, it was evident. His kids were always with him and though he made cracks about his wife they were together. Like so Lucy's family and friends supported her and took care of her the best they new how. To finish, the movie also showed what real love is. Henry demonstrated sacrificial love for Lucy. Certainly not the pinnacle of excellent theater but it isn't intended to be. It is a good movie with minimal offensive elements that embraces true love and family values. We'll watch this one again.",9,0,0,21 February 2004
