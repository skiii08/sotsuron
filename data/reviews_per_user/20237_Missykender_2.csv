Howl's Moving Castle," Another Miyazaki Masterpiece
","I was flipping channels last night, and stumbled across 'Howl's Moving Castle': The description said 'Anime' so I flipped it on, and as I saw the first scene I originally recognized Miyazaki's/Stupdio Ghibli's unmistakable work, so I immediately hit the 'record' button. I was disappointed that I'd missed about the first 20 minutes, but it didn't matter: The story immediately pulled me in, and as the story progressed, I was able to piece together what had gone before.Many other reviewers have written about the look and the content of the film, so I'll just note on how the movie made me FEEL: Howl's Moving Castle, like all the rest of Miyazaki's films, alternately evoked feelings of awe (I mean, the mouth hanging-open type), wonder, sorrow, and indescribable joy: His works are as much a labor of love as Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Even in the English version, the depths of warmth and respect for this work shine through on the part of the actors. Stellar!",10,2,3,17 March 2008
Lilo & Stitch," One of the first truly original Disney animated films, ever!
","I knew this film would be different from the instant the credits rolled, when they read 'based on an idea from Chris Sanders'.  Wow...an original IDEA, not a knock-off of some old fairy tale.This is a lovely film.  It's beautiful to look at:  The backgrounds are dazzling hand-painted watercolor backdrops, a technique that hasn't been seen from Disney since the 1960's.  It gives the viewer a sense that this film was lovingly rendered by artists, rather than much of the impersonal computer-generated images we've seen of late.The stark reality of Lilo's situation may disturb some extremely young viewers, as she tries to cope with the loss of her parents.  The writers are to be commended for not trying to soften the very real problems her broken family faces.  It is still very evident, however, that she and her sister love each other, and that they are frantically trying to make their situation work.As in many recent animated successes, they've figured out that satire works, and the film is peppered with pop-culture references that some of the younger viewers might miss altogether.  (There are also a few visual references to some other Disney animated films, which a keen-eyed viewer should be able to pick out.)The music is wonderful:  Some great Elvis classics, and a lovely new original musical score that transports you to the Hawaiian Isles.Overall, I haven't enjoyed a film this much since 'The Iron Giant', which was of a similar quality and story, but unfortunately did poorly in the box office.  I devoutly hope that the same thing doesn't happen in this case, and that people will let the studio know with their pocketbooks that we wish to see more quality films like this!I thought this film was definitely a 10 out of 10, this is one which will be in my permanent DVD collection!",10,1,2,24 June 2002
