Hereditary," Lots of promises, no pay off...
","While the camera work, the sound engineering and most notably some of the acting is top notch, this does not make a great movie. Story and pacing is a serious problem and while the build up is quite good, the pay off falls short. Halfway through it's runtime the movie goes in a very familliar and dare I say: tropy direction and sadly it doesn't redeem itself again. Tony Collette has some very strong moments in the movie but she goes over the top - allmost cringeworthy so - in some other parts (you'll know it when you see it), so I don't think that Oscar is going to happen. At some of it's best moments this movie has hints of and nods to classics like The Shining, The Exorsist and even Susperia but it lacks the hart, soul and most important the consistency of those great movies.",6,2,4,16 June 2018
