Walk the Line," Johnny would be proud
","I grew up listening to Johnny Cash and watching re-runs of his shows. So when I first heard of this movie being made I was skeptical. However, never in a million years would I have thought this would be such a fantastic combination of actors to portray Mr. Cash's life. I am a die-hard Joaquin fan, so of course I was anxiously awaiting the release of this film. I think that he is finally getting the recognition that he deserves, and hopefully in the future we will continue to see great things from him. Don't get me wrong it is not like you get lost and forget Mr. Phoenix was pretending to be Johnny, but it is the fact that he actually captures the spirit of him. I was very impressed. The movie is very short considering the long and interesting life that Mr. Cash lived. I hope that he would be proud.",10,0,1,7 December 2005
