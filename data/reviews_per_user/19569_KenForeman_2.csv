The Ring," wow... a good horror movie, lives up to its hype
","Recent horror movies have been disappointing for me.  'The Blair Witch Project' seemed more enamored with its first-person cinematography than telling a good story.  I had high hopes for 'Mothman Prophecies,' but left the theatre feeling as if I had just been pickpocketed.  I didn't go into 'The Ring' with very high expectations.'The Ring' begins like a number of other movies.  Teenage girls, alone in a house, rehashing horror stories and urban legends.  Ten minutes into the movie, I was wondering if this was yet another horror/slasher ('I know what you did...' genre).  Thirty minutes later, I felt like I was actually watching a movie that a director, writer, and cast actually *cared* about. It went from horror/'slasher' to a rather unique story around a cliche urban legend.Daveigh Chase was unrecognizeable as Samara.  Ms. Chase is typically the 'cute, Disney girl' ('Lilo & Stitch','Spirited Away').  In 'The Ring,' she is truly otherworldly.  Her acting gave me goosebumps. Naimi Watts and Martin Henderson were both very good in their roles.  They seemed to be real, everyday, people who were caught up in a bizarre horror/mystery.I'd recommend 'The Ring' to others.  It might not be a movie you'd see again and again, but it will leave you scared and thinking about your fears. That's more than I can say about most modern horror movies.",Null,0,0,22 October 2002
The Village," Forces you to take time to stop and think...
","If Alfred Hitchcock were alive today, would critics and audiences be as unkind as they are to M. Night Shyamalan?  Just as Hitchcock's name was the draw for viewers then, 'a M. Night Shyamalan film' is the hook today. People see the phrase and already have preconceived notions about the film. Shyamalan, like Hitchcock, experiments with characters and stories.'The Village' is no real horror movie.  Going to the theatre thinking you'll get a good, visceral scare is probably going to result in disappointment. 'The Village' is a drama, maybe an 'intellectual suspense', and has the trademark twist.  It's unfortunate that Shyamalan prides himself so much on twists because his movies could probably stand on their own as dramas or well-crafted tales.The dynamics between William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard make it watchable alone.  Some give Shyamalan flak for his cameos, but he's simply following in the footsteps of Hitchcock and Stephen King.  Go expecting a story and a twist (or two), have some patience, and you'll be well rewarded.",7,0,0,11 August 2004
