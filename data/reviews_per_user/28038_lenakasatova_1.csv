Walk the Line," Not to allow money influence you in a bad way
","I want to write a review on the film by James Mangold 'Walk the Line'. This film was short in 2005. The main actors were Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon and Ginnifer Goodwin. The genre is Biography, Drama, Music. The main idea is to tell us in the smallest detail the biography of a famous singer. The director wanted to tell what difficulties the star faced, how he went from poverty to wealth and how he did not hold back to temptations and 'crossed the line' of what was permitted. Sometimes such cases happened also in the life of a temporary man, when he was poor firstly and then became a rich. It is very difficult not to allow money influence you in a bad way. This film caused me both positive and negative emotions. The film is not suitable for everyone, as I think, because it will not be interested for every person to sit for 2.5 hours and watch a biopic, especially if you did not know anything about the main character before, like it was in my case.
In the center of the story we can see Joni Cash, the famous singer of his time. The narration begins with his childhood, where his elder brother, who was an ideal for him, died. Because of this case, his relationship with his father was not good, and this problem worried him all his life. Next, the director described the formation of his singer's career step by step, difficulties he faced, temptations of life, and love in his life. The main woman in his life was his second wife, singer June. Their relationship also develops quite uneasy throughout the entire story.
Music which is performed by the main character meets at every step in the film. In my opinion, it was a little tiresome. Although, at some points, it conveyed the feelings of the characters very well . I recommend this film to all fans of the creativity of this singer, and those who do not mind spending almost 3 hours of his life on the film. In my case, I do not want to revise this film again, because the plot, in my opinion, is tightened so much.",5,0,1,11 March 2018
