Ford v Ferrari," Entertaining if a bit overly long
","'Ford v Ferrari' (2019 release; 152 min.) brings the true story of the showdown at the 24 hrs of LeMans in 1966. As the movie opens, we see Carroll Shelby in a flashback win the 1959 LeMans. We then go forward a few years when Henry Ford II address the Ford factory floor asking for some good new ideas. Up-and-coming executive Lee Iacocca suggests buying the struggling Ferrari car manufacturer but the deal fails. In a parallel story, we get to know rebel driver Ken Miles.... At this point we are less than 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from director James Mansfield (The Wolverine; Logan). Here he brings to the screen the heated rivalry between two very different giants in the car industry: Ford and Ferrari. The movie starts promisingly, but pretty soon we are bogged down in all kinds of corporate background and infighting that play out for way too long. Honestly, the movie could've been trimmed by 20 to 25 minutes in the movie's first half, and would not have lost any of the movie's essence. Matt Damon en Christian Bale are terrific in the lead roles of Shelby and Miles. The actual racing sequences are entertaining and loud, very loud.The movie opened wide the previous weekend, too great acclaim and box office success. I saw the movie in its second weekend of play, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. Positive word of mouth will likely result in continued strong business in the weeks to come. If you have any interest in car racing, or are simply interested in a well-made and entertaining movie (even if a bit overly long for its own good), I readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD or Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7,3,7,25 November 2019
Saturday Night Fever," Standing the test of time, 40 years later
","'Saturday Night Fever' was released in 1977, meaning that this year marks the 40th anniversary. My local art-house theater here in Cincinnati had the good sense to hold a one-off special screening to commemorate the event (more in that later). I can't recall when was the last time I had seen the film, and in fact I wouldn't be surprised if this was the first time I saw it again in its entirety since I saw it during its original release (in Belgium, where I grew up, the movie was released in Spring of 1978, if memory serves me right).Here some comments, in no particular order, having re-seen the film after all these years: 1. The music! Yes, the music! it remains the best feature of the film, and all of those Gibb Brothers-penned tunes are nothing short of a classic, every single one of them. 2. The dancing! John Travolta is as smooth as silk as he dances his way onto the dance floor and busts those disco moves. Love the scene when the entire floor dances along in unison to the Bee Gees' 'Night Fever'. And then there is Travolta's long solo during the Bee Gees' 'You Shouls Be Dancing'. Wow, just wow. 3. I had forgotten how many social commentaries and undercurrents there were in the film: tension within Tony's family, Tony's brother pulling a shocker, peer pressure among Tony's friends to 'fit in', even more pressure on the girls--if it all sounds contemporary, well, it is of course. They played out in society 40 years ago, and today--albeit not the exact same way of course. 4. The Travolta character gets a raise from his boss to $4/hr. Wonder how much that is in today's dollars? Almost $17! (Current federal minimum wage is $7.25.) 5. The age difference between Travolta and Gorney is much more noticeable to me now than it was for me as a kid (i was 17 watching it back then). 6. I was surprised at the number of F bombs throughout the movie (I don't know what version I saw in Belgium, the original R-rated version, or the subsequent revised PG version). 7. Seeing New York in 1977 like this, it feels like a bombed-out post-apocalyptic place, outright scary and depressing.Bottom line: SNF stands the test of time, 40 years later, and then some. The Sunday matinée one-off screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, mostly people in my age group (I am 57). The event was co-sponsored by one of the city 'oldies' radio station, and everyone had a great time, hooting and hollering in the beginning when Travolta was walking as the Bee Gees 'Stayin' Alive' was blasting from the screen. If you have a chance to re-visit this classic on the big screen, don't miss it!",9,1,2,16 July 2017
The Lobster," One of a kind movie about love (mandatory or prohibited)
","'The Lobster' (2015 release from Europe; 118 min.) opens with a bang, literally. In the pre-opening credit scene, we see a woman getting out of her car, running into the field, and shooting a donkey (spurring gasps from the theater audience, more on that later). After the opening credits, we get to know David, whose wife has just left him. David is taken to a hotel where he now has 45 days to find a new mate or be transformed into an animal. If it gets that far, he chooses to be a lobster ('because they live to be a hundred, have blue blood in them, and are fertile their entire life'). 'Excellent choice' responds the hotel manager, adding 'most people choose to be a dog, that's why you see dogs everywhere'. Will David find a mate? Or will he become a lobster? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Greek writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos, who previously gave us the brilliant 'Dogtooth'. This is his debut English language film. Here he brings us a completely original, truly one-of-a-kind, story about love, be it mandatory love (first half of the movie), or prohibited love (second half of the movie). The movie feels strangely dispassionate yet engaging, in particular in the last 45 minutes. Colin Farrell brings the performance of a lifetime as David, your average 'Joe Six Pack', slight beer belly and all. Even though Rachel Weisz gets second-to-top billing, she doesn't appear until the second half of the movie, but when she finally does, she blows everyone away as 'Short Sighted Woman'. There are many other choice performances, though: check out French actress Léa Seydoux as the ruthless leader of the 'loners', always on the lookout to detect (and punish--'red kiss' anyone?) any flirting between the loners. In the opening credits, all the different co-producers seemingly amount to a mini-European Union summit, as LOTS of European countries co-financed this movie. It's almost amazing to me that such an original and let's face it, very unconventional idea was able to garner the necessary financing or was able to convince first rate stars like Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz to sign on to this. But the main thing is that Lanthimos made it happen somehow.'The Lobster' made a huge splash at the 2015 Cannes film festival. No idea why it's taken another full year to find its way onto the screen here in the US but better late than never I suppose. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay, but just okay (about 10-12 people). After the initial gasps, the audience settled in and laughed at all the right times. I can't see this playing in theaters a very long time, the movie is too 'weird' and off-center for that. I happen to think it's one of the most original movies about love I've seen in a very, very long time, and would readily suggest that you check this out, be it in theaters, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. 'The Lobster' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,2,5,28 May 2016
Blade Runner 2049," One of the best sequels EVER
","'Blade Runner 2049' (2017 release; 162 min.) brings the story of K. As the movie opens, we get a thumbnail reminder/explanation of what replicants are and what a blade runner is. The newest generation replicants (in 'California 2049' we are told) are fully integrated into society. We see K visit a farm outside LA, where he 'retires' an old model replicant who had taken up farming. On the farm, K stumbles upon a mysterious box that contains the remains of a female replicant who it seems was pregnant and died while delivering the child. How could that be possible? At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the long-awaited (35 years!) sequel to the seminal sci-fi movie 'Blade Runner', which when it came out in 1982 was light-years ahead of its time and cemented Ridley Scott as one of the top directors of his generation. This time around, Denis Villeneuve (who previously has brought us, among others, the excellent 'Sicario' and 'Arrival') is at the helm, and, apparently not feeling the weight of sky-high expectations 3+ decades in the making, Villeneuve takes us on a journey that delivers, and then some. This is a plot-heavy movie, so the lesser said, the better. But a couple of general observations: I cannot easily recall a movie where the production and set design is so integral to the plot, and so remarkable. The production budget for this movie reportedly was $150 million, and it certainly shows. But even more important, it is absolutely amazing how closely this sequel stays true to the original movie in spirit and in tone. If you are expecting an 'action movie' (as the Blade Runner 2049 trailer gave the impression), you will be wildly disappointed. Sure there are some action scenes, but the movie is slow-paced in the best possible way. Ryan Gosling brings perhaps the finest performance of his career as K. And don't be mistaken, this is a Ryan Gosling movie far more than it is a Harrison Ford movie (who finally appears almost 2 hours into it). Cuban actress Ana de Armas (previously in 'Hands of Stone' and 'War Dogs') has a break-out performance as K's virtual PA. Jared Leno has a small but noteworthy role as the replicant manufacturer Wallace. Robin Wright stars as K's boss in the LAPD. Dutch actress Sylvia Hoeks (keeping the Dutch connection with the 1982 movie starring Dutch actor Rutger Hauer) is remarkable as Wallace's enforcer Luv. Last but certainly not least, the original score (credited to Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer) is very much Vangelis-inspired and sounds glorious. Beware: at 2 hrs. and 45 min., this is a dense movie which takes its time, but which rewards richly for those wanting to invest their time, interest and emotional involvement.'Blade Runner 2049' opened wide this weekend and I couldn't wait to see it. I went to see it with my 30 yr. old son. In anticipation, we had watched (for me: re-watched) the original movie, and our expectations were high. Even so (or despite that), we were both stunned how good this movie was. We literally couldn't movie from our seats when it was over and we stayed stuck for the entire end credits (which seemingly take forever). The Saturday early evening screening where we saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely, but by no means was it a sell-out. Regardless, if you liked the 1982 movie, I bet you will LOVE this sequel, one of the best ever sequels in my humble opinion. I'd readily suggest you check out 'Blade Runner', be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",9,16,37,8 October 2017
First Man," Good movie, but questionable sequences and headache-inducing camera work
","'First Man' (2018 release; 141 min.) brings the story of Neil Armstrong and NASA's quest to get a man on the moon before the Russians could. As the movie opens, Armstrong is testing a plane in the upper reaches of the atmosphere (140,000 ft. altitude), and after initially bouncing off of the atmosphere, managers to get back safely, at which point the movie tells it's '1961, Mogave Desert, CA'. We get to know the Armstrong family, including the desperate health battle of their young daughter Karen. Armstrong makes it through the Gemini astronaut selections in 1962, prompting a move to Houston. 'It's a fresh start', comments Janet. At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Damien Chazelle, whose previous two films ('Whiplash' and 'La La Land') hit the bull's eye. Here he brings the book of the same name to the big screen. The biggest challenge with a movie like this is how to keep things interesting, if not dramatic, when we already know the outcome (will Armstrong perish in the test flights? urr... NO!). That doesn't mean that some of the footage of these flights isn't terrific. I have a greater issue with the camera work. I totally get it that Chazelle wants to convey the claustrophobic feeling of being inside the small space capsule , and he does a terrific job at that (if you have visited the National Air $ Space Museum, it truly is shocking to see how small and primitive-looking these capsules were). But the movie incessantly features extreme close-ups and headache-inducing handheld cameras for much of the time, for no apparent dramatic reason (at one point Janet crosses the street to talk to her neighbor Pat--you'd think that an earthquake with a magnitude of 6 on the Richter scale has just hit). Also questionable to me are some of the sequences involving Neil and Janet (just one example: when Janet visits Neil in quarantine upon returning to earth, neither of them has any smile or joy--or sign of relief. I doubt that was really the case. But maybe I am nitpicking.In case you aren't aware, Neil Armstrong lived the last 30+ years of his life here in Cincinnati (where I am) until his passing in 2012. He was a notorious pack rat of memorabilia throughout his career (never mentioned or alluded to in the film) His sons Mark (who still lives in Cincinnati) and Rick have recently announced that thousands of items from Neil's personal collection will be auctioned off...The movie opened wide this weekend, and the Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely but not quite a sell-out. The movie performed not quite fully up to expectations at the box office ($16.5 million). I can't help but feel that many expected bigger things. The movie is good, maybe very good, but it is not the critical home run that was either of Chazelle's earlier movies. Still, it will likely garner a number of Oscar nominations. If you liked 'The Right Stuff' or 'Apollo 13', I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7,7,13,15 October 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," Kidnapped or rescued? ...Keeping you guessing from start to finish
","'10 Cloverfield Lane' (2016 release; 103 min.) brings the story of Michelle. As the movie opens, we see her packing her things and leaving an apartment, leaving the keys and an engagement ring on the counter. While driving out of New Orleans, the boyfriend calls and tries to convince her to come back. Next thing we know, Michelle is in a terrible car accident (all this is before the movie's opening titles). When Michelle wakes up, she finds herself in a windowless room, literally chained to the wall. Her captor, Howard, informs her that 'I'm sorry, but nobody is looking for you' that he's keeping her for her own sake. What is going on? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the spiritual follow-up to 2008's 'Cloverfield', the surprise box office hit about aliens invading Manhattan. Don't call this a sequel, though. The story line has nothing to do with the earlier movie. Here, we get a movie that reminds of Stephen King's 'Misery' in a way: Howard claims to have rescued Michelle, but did he really or is he a kidnapper? The brilliant thing about this film is that it keeps you guessing pretty much throughout. Just when you think you're onto something, the plot-heavy movie surprises you once more. And the last 30 min. are just out of this world. This is directed by newcomer Dan Trachtenberg, who, under the tutelage of producer J.J. Abrams, does a phenomenal job in crafting this mystery-thriller. The acting performances are top-notch, starting with John Goodman as Howard, but Mary Elizabeth Winstead, best known from indie movies like 'Smashed' and 'A.C.O.D.', is equally impressive as Michelle. john Gallagher, Jr. as Emmett rounds out the cast (yes, one could say that the majority of a movie is a filmed play set in a bunker). The boyfriend who calls Michelle early in the movie is voices by... Bradley Cooper! Last but not least, there is a nice orchestral score, courtesy of composer Bear McCreary.'10 Cloverfield Lane' opened this weekend nationwide. I had seen the trailer a number of times, and couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not nearly as packed as I had expected it to be. Regardless, if you are in the mood for a good mystery-thriller, you can count on having a finger-lickin' good time with this movie. '10 Cloverfield Lane' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,1,5,12 March 2016
The Finest Hours," Good ol' fashioned disaster-and-rescue drama is better than the 'experts' would have you believe
","'The Finest Hours' (2016 release; 117 min.) brings the telling, 'based on a true story' we are reminded, of a daring rescue attempt at sea. As the movie opens, it is 'Wellfleet, MA, November 1951', and we get to know two Coast Guarders who are out on a double date. Bernie (played by Chris Pine) is immediately smitten by Miriam *played by Holiday Grainger). The movie then shifts to February 17, 1952, where Bernie and Miriam are attending a party, and they decide to get married in April. Later that night, as a nor'easter is bearing down, the Pendleton tanker is in serious trouble, and before we know it, Bernie is ordered to assemble a crew and go out to find any survivors of the Pendleton. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is a big budget movie from Disney Studios, directed by Craig Gillespie ('Lars and The Real Girl'; 'Million Dollar Arm'). If you have seen the movie's trailer (which as been inescapable in the theaters in recent weeks), you know exactly what you are in for: a bigger-than-life, against-all-odds rescue attempt of the crew of the Pendleton tanker, which has split in two, by a four man crew of the Coast Guard in Chatham, MA. Don't ask me how the Pendleton's remaining half tanker doesn't sink! I think it has something to do with the boat's balancing tanks, but in the end it doesn't matter, as we are here to witness some of the wildest open sea disaster scenes you'll ever see. In a sense, this reminds of 'Titanic', except that the action scenes are pumped up and on steroids. Chris Pine (as Bernie) and Casey Affleck (as the Pendleton's main guy) are fine, but to be honest, they and the rest of the gang are all second fiddle to the special effects. I know that it's all CGI, yet it looks so darn realistic! The movie has a great orchestral score, courtesy of veteran composer Carter Burwell (his score for 'Carol' received an Oscar nomination). Also make sure to stay through the movie's end titles, as we then get a bunch of period pictures from the Boston Globe and other news sources with the real life people from the events (and likely the source of the costuming for the film). Last but not least, this is released both in 2D and 3D, but just know that the movie was shot in 2D and then converted into 3D (I saw it in 2D). Bottom line: 'The Finest Hours' is a good ol' fashioned disaster-and-rescue drama that is much better than the 'experts' would have you believe.'The Finest Hours' opened nationally this weekend, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. somewhat to my surprise. Regardless, if you are in the mood for an effects-heavy but very realistic disaster-and-rescue movie, I encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray (although a movie of this kind just begs to be seen on the big screen). 'The Finest Hours' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",7,87,121,31 January 2016
War Dogs," Funny movie about a serious topic
","'War Dogs' (2016 release; 114 min.) is 'based on true events' we are reminded as the film opens. We are in January, 2008', when we see a guy, Dave Packouz, thrown out of a car and assaulted by what look to be kidnappers. When then move back to 'Miami Beach 2005', as we see Dave struggle to make end meets as a licensed massage therapist. Then one day at a funeral, Dave runs into his old buddy Efraim Diveroli, who has recently moved back to Miami. Efraim, a small time arms dealer, can use Dave's help with the arms bonanza that is the war in Iraq. Before we know it, the two are starting to sell arms to the Pentagon. At this point we're 15-20 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie, based on a Rolling Stone Magazine article, is directed by Todd 'The Hangover' Phillips and equally as important, produced by Bradley Cooper's production company (Cooper himself also plays a small role as another shady arms dealer). The movie is divided up in 7 or 8 chapters (I didn't count them exactly) such as 'All money is made between the lines', and 'When does telling the truth help anyone?'. Miles Teller (from 'Whiplash') and Jonah Hill are David and Efraim, respectively. Teller looks so young! Hill on the other hand seems he was made to play this role. The movie is billed as a comedy, and yes there are quite a few laughs to be had, as the absurdity of the situation lends itself to easy laughs, There should've been a serous undercurrent as well, about the flood gates opened by the Bush administration to fill billions of dollars in war procurement, enticing second and third tier companies and scammers to get a piece of the pie. (A recent book called Consequence by Eric Fair goes into that aspect as well, and it is not a comedy). last but not least, there is a smorgasboard of music placed throughout the movie, from CCR's Fortunate Son to the Who's Behind Blue Eyes. to Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows (playing over the end credits).'War Dogs' is now into its second week, and it did okay at the box office in the first week. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay, not poor, not great. I heard a lot of chuckles throughout the movie, so that was a good sign. Bottom line' 'War Dogs' is a funny movie with some great performances but lacks the seriousness to be a heavy hitter.",6,1,2,28 August 2016
Deepwater Horizon," 'The well from hell'... Epic disaster movie more than delivers
","'Deepwater Horizon' (2016 release; 107 min.) brings the story of the 2010 oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. As the movie opens, we see Mike and Felicia wake up, shortly before Mike is off on his next 21 day stint on the rig. Mike and other gather at the Bristow heliport, where they leave on the 45 min. flight out to the rig. On the flight are also 2 BP senior manager, who are coming to take a look why the rip is 43 days (and tens of millions of dollars) behind schedule. Once on the Deepwater Horizon, it doesn't take long before tension mounts between the BP guys and the Transocean guys who are operating the rig. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie.Couple of comments: this movie marks the reunion between director Peter Berg and Mark Walhberg (who stars and produces), as a few year ago they brought us the excellent 'Lone Survivor'. At the beginning of the film, we are told that this is 'based on true events', which for me typically means 'this is the Hollywood version of what happened'. I have no idea how much artistic liberty the film makers have taken to make this into a compelling movie. As long as you can live with the fact that this is perhaps (or likely) a condensed or partly-imagined version of the truth, you are in for one heck of a film. Indeed, the film is roughly divided up equally between pre-disaster, and then the actual disaster. Just when you think that it can't get any worse, it does, and I found myself at the edge of my seat on more than one occasion. The photography is pure eye-candy from start to finish (quite a bit must've been CGI but it sure looks incredibly real). There are some great lines in the movie. When asked by the BP guy to assess the rig, Mike says 'It's like a plane running out of gas as it's landing', wow. And someone else comments that the rig is sitting on 'the well from hell', ha! Walhberg is his usual solid, but the best performances for me came from rugged Kurt Russell (as 'Mr. Jimmy', the rig's manager) and, even better, John Malkovich as one of the BP meanies.'Deepwater Horizon' opened a few weekends ago, but scheduling conflicts and other commitment kept me from seeing this until now. The Thursday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was not attended well (not a surprise, given the time and day). What is surprising is that, despite mostly positive reviews and reactions from the critic and the public at large, it has vastly under-performed at the box office, even more so if you keep in mind the movie's astronomical (north of 100 mill) budget (and the movie looks its budget). I was looking forward to seeing this, and I ended up liking it even more than I had expected. A movie like this needs to be experienced on the big screen for maximum impact. 'Deepwater Horizon' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,0,0,13 October 2016
Hereditary," Not bad, but not the masterpiece the critics make this out to be
","'Hereditary' (2018 release; 120 min.) brings the story of the Graham family. As the movie opens, we get to know Annie and Steve, and their teenage kids Peter and Charlie, as they attend the funeral of Annie's mom Ellen. Annie is surprised at the many people attending the funeral that shoe doesn't know. It's clear that Annie and her mom didn't have the best relationship, and Annie doesn't feel too sad about her mom passing. Meanwhile Peter is wanting to attend a party at a friend's house. Annie agrees but forces him to take along his younger sister, with disastrous consequences... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the debut feature-length film of writer-director Ari Aster. He brings us a tale of spiritualism gone horribly awry, and that;s about all I can say without spoiling anything. Let me be upfront: if it weren't for the off-the-charts ratings (currently at 93% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), I would not have gone to see this. But curiosity got the better of me when I saw this near-universal critical acclaim. What I got was a horror movie that is certainly not bad, but neither is it the masterpiece that the critic makes this out to be, and in fact 'Hereditary' is not nearly as good as some other recent, far more clever and original, horror movies such as 'Get Out', 'A Quiet Place, 'or 'It Comes At Night', just to name those. Kudos to Toni Colette, who is outstanding as Annie, making this movie feel more authentic that it actually is. Last but certainly not least, there is a terrific, one might say classic, score, and imagine my surprise when I saw in the end titles that the score is composed by Colin Stetson, wow! I will need to check out the score for sure.'Hereditary' opened wide this weekend, and the Sunday early evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely. In fact, the early box office reports are that the movie did better than expected/projected, grossing $13 mill (against a budget for a mere $10 mill). Bottom line: if you like horror movies, or are simply in the mood for one, I'd say keep your expectations in check as you see this out at the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6,3,6,10 June 2018
Detroit," Important social issues, but film gave me headache and motion sickness
","'Detroit' (2017 release; 143 min.) brings the story of the Detroit riots. As the movie opens, we get a 2 min. animated intro as to how events starting with the Great Migration around WWI eventually led to 'today', which the movie reminds us is 'July 23, 1967'. When the movie gets going, an unlicensed club is raided by the Detroit Police, and it's not long before the mostly white cops beat up the mostly black patrons of the club, Things get out of hand pretty fast after that, and before we know it, the city is ablaze, the National Guards are called in, and a state of emergency is declared...Couple of comments: this is the latest film from critically acclaimed director Kathryn Bigelow. I adore her most recent work (The Hurt Locker; Zero Dark Thirty), and hence had high hopes for this movie. Here, working from a scrip by frequent collaborator Mark Boal, Bigelow intends to bring us what happened during the riots in Detroit exactly 50 years ago. For sure there were a lot of things that went wrong, on both sides, and hence these are important social issues that merit, indeed need, attention and discussion. It is then all the more regrettable that Bigelow chose to make the film the way she did. Almost from the get-go what we see and experience on the big screen is an incessant use of hand-held cameras (and shake them a bit for good measure). That, in combination with the all too frequent extreme close-ups, make for almost impossible viewing over an extended period of time. Let me just admit it right here and now: I made it through half the movie (70 min.). Realizing that yet another 75 min. was to come, and that I had a headache induced by watching the film, as well as possible motion sickness, I simply could not carry on and bailed. When it becomes that painful to simply watch a movie, there is a problem. And I was not alone. A woman 2 seats from me also bailed, and only after half an hour...'Detroit' expanded nationally this weekend. I went to see it with a couple on Sunday late afternoon here in Cincinnati. Even though the couple stayed, afterwards I got a text from the guy saying 'my wife essentially got sick', but he felt it was a 'great, great, great and important movie.' I responded back that I was glad he liked it. He in turn replied 'I appreciated and respected it... 'liked' would be impossible'. Case closed.",3,15,32,7 August 2017
Rocketman," 'Victim of Love' looking for redemption
","'Rocketman' (2019 release; 121 min.) is a bio-pic about Elton John, 'based on a true fantasy' as we were promised in the movie's trailer. As the movie opens, Elton is in an outrageous costume and he staggers into what we then understand is his very first AA meeting. Elton begins telling his life story to the group, and as he starts singing ', the movie morphs back to Elton's early childhood. We get to know Reggie Dwight as a 5 yr. old, living with his miserable parents (his dad is cold and aloof, to say the least), but Reggie takes an immediate interest in his dad's record collection... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: Elton John's biopic has been in development hell for many years (at one point Justin Timberlake was attached to play Elton), but the movie is finally here, directed by Dexter Fletcher, who also came to the rescue for last year's Freddie Mercury bio-pic 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. The interesting thing is that these 2 movie's couldn't be more different. Whereas 'Bohemian Rhapsody' follows the traditional bio-pic path, 'Rocketman' does not, and cannot be relied upon to be an accurate reflection of Elton John's musical career (example: it shows Elton performing 'Crocodile Rock' at one of the famed 1970 LA Troubadour shows, a song from several years later that he didn't perform in 1970). Later on, 'Rocketman' (the song) is played out as a long fantasy scene in a pool. And so on. The movie feels more like a Broadway play, and in fact I will state right now that it's only a matter of time before this becomes a mega-Broadway show. The other big difference with 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is that the songs we hear are sung by Taron Egerton (best known for his role in the 'Kingsman' movies and also in 'Eddie the Eagle'), and often in dramatically different arrangements than the originals. Let's be clear: Egerton is absolutely fantastic as Elton, and he also has a great voice, but there is something slightly unsettling about hearing these songs in such a different way. But in the end, the movie clearly is about love (or the lack thereof), and Elton's never-ending journey for redemption (which he eventually finds). The movie does not shy away from Elton's love for men (and the movie is rated R accordingly). 'Victim of Love' is surely what he was, and the song is featured prominently in the film. But the ultimate redemption is equally deserved (as we see in the end-titles update).'Rocketman' was released wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati in a fairly large theater was sold out to the very last seat. I quite enjoyed the movie, although I don't think it's up to the same level as 'Bohemian Rhapsody' but Taron Egerton deserves props for his performance. If you have any interest in Elton John or in rock history, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6,2,3,1 June 2019
A Star Is Born," Timeless classic redone the right way for this day and age
","'A Star Is Born' (2018 release; 135 min.) brings the story of Jackson 'Jack' Maine and Ally. As the movie opens, Jack is hitting the stage at a massive outdoor show. After the show, he boozes up in the getaway SUV, and orders his driver to stop at a nearby bar. It happens to be the place where Ally, after her daytime kitchen job, performs regularly. That evening, she brings 'La Vie En Rose', stunning Jack with her singing. He meets Ally after the show, and they hit it off... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the 4th incarnation of 'A Star Is Born'. The previous version starring Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, from 1976, is the version I grew up with. While that movie's flaws were obvious, I nevertheless quite liked it. Now 42 years later comes this up-to-date remake. This marks the directing debut of actor Bradley Cooper, and what a debut it turns out to be! Cooper also co-produced, co-stars and co-wrote the script. Cooper's challenges/risks were formidable: would he be a credible 'rock star'? More importantly, would he be a credible singer? Answer to both of those questions is a resounding YES. Even more surprising is Lady Gaga as Ally. Who knew she'd be able to give such a nuanced acting performance (obviously we already knew that she has the singing talent). The on-screen chemistry between these two leads is palpable, making the movie such much more believable. But wait! there is more! For me arguable the movie's best performance comes from Sam Elliot, as Jack's road manager (and elder brother). What a stage presence! The musical performances are generally speaking outstanding. Cooper's backup band features Lucas Nelson (son of Willie), who co-wrote most of the songs, and the Promise of the Real. It's fun recognizing some of the venues and festivals where the concert footage was filmed (I spotted both Coachella and Glastonbury, among others). The only criticism I have is that the movie, which is pretty much flawless in the first hour, is a bit overly long, in particular towards the end. But all in all, kudos to Cooper for taking on what could've been a disaster, but instead ends up being a remake of a timeless classic that is just right for this day and age.'A Star Is Born' premiered at the Venice film festival in late August, to immediate and universal acclaim. The movie opened wide this past weekend. The Monday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was PACKED. Yes, on a Monday! I am going on record already that 'A Star Is Born' not only will get multiple Oscar nominations early next year, it will in fact win the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress, among others. I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",8,12,25,9 October 2018
Wind River," 'You are looking for clues, but you are missing all the signs'
","'Wind River' (2017 release; 107 min.) brings the story of Wildlife Officer Cory Lambert. As the movie opens, reminding us 'Inspired By Actual Events', we briefly see a woman running for her life in the snow. We then are introduced to Lambert, who is hunting down wolves. Lambert visits his ex, where he picks up his young son for the day. Lambert then visits the parents of his ex, as their life stock has been attacked, possibly by a lion. In the course of starting his investigation, Lambert finds the frozen body of the woman we saw running for her life. Because it looks like a possible homicide, an FBI agent is called. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie marks the second directing stint of highly praised writer (and erstwhile actor) Taylor Sheridan, whose previous two movies, 2015's 'Sicario' and last year's 'Hell or High Water', were among the top movie of the year for me. 'Wind River' is for me one of the most anticipated movies of the year, period. With 'Wind River', Sheridan goes in a very different direction again as compared to 'Sicario' and 'Hell or High Water', digging into a murder mystery, set in an Indian reservation in snow-covered Wyoming. Jeremy Renner brings perhaps his finest performance of his career as the Wildlife hunter/tracer Cory Lambert, who himself carries a heavy secret. Elizabeth Olsen is Jane Banner, the wide-eyed inexperienced FBI agent who is in way over her head but is determined to do what is right. 'You are looking for clues but you are missing all the signs', remarks Lambert early on, and she begs him to help her. And there are plenty of potential suspects--it's not a coincidence that this is set in a community that has more than its share of crime and misery. Sheridan leads with confidence as the tension in the movie rarely lets up. Bottom line: this is another nice movie from Tayalor Sheridan, who in just a matter of a few years has become one of Hollywood most accomplished writer-directors. Can't wait for his next movie, 'Soldado', a sequel to 'Sicario', to be released next year.'Wind River' opened this weekend at my local art house theater here in Cincinnati on not one, but two screens, a rarity. The Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely for a matinée. I imagine that 'Wind River' will benefit from the strong word-of-mouth that this will surely generate. If you are in the mood for a top-notch mystery drama with some stellar performances, you cannot go wrong with 'Wind River' be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. 'Wind River' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,128,162,19 August 2017
The Death of Stalin," Comedy? Satire? What a joke! (no laughs, no chuckles)
","'The Death of Stalin' (2017 release from the UK; 107 min.) brings the story of the power struggle to succeed Stalin. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is 'Moscow, 1953'. Stalin is listening to a live broadcast of a classical orchestra performance, and decides to order a recording of it. When it turns out no recording was made, the Radio Moscow manager corrals the audience and orchestra to redo the entire concert. Meanwhile, Stalin has issued more death lists and sends out his men to round up and kill the people named in the list. Then, shortly after Stalin gets the orchestra recording delivered to his office, he suffers a cerebral hemorrhage, and the Central Committee members begin scrambling to become the next Soviet leader. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is co-written and directed by none other than Armando Iannucci, the creator of HBO's 'Veep'. So I immediately thought or expected to be charmed in the best possible way. Alas, it was not to be. As the movie opened, I kept waiting for some funny stuff, or at least something, ANYTHING, to give me a reason to smile or chuckle. I didn't get any, I am sad to say. I have no idea what was going on, other than the scheming and backstabbing among the potential successors of Stalin. Much has been made about the (alleged) historical inaccuracies in the movie. I am not a historian, and so I couldn't care less whether Iannucci took an artistic license with some of the facts. If you look at the movie's poster, you'll notice that the tag line is 'A Comedy of Terrors'. I wish that were true! The reality is that this movie completely misfires, either as a comedy or as a satire, period.'The Death of Stalin' premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival. Imagine my surprise when this opened last week in both of the art-house theaters here in Cincinnati, and on multiple screens in each of them. I haven't the faintest idea why they are thinking that there is a pent-up demand for this movie. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (less than 10 people), I couldn't help but notice that I wasn't the only one waiting for an opportunity to laugh or chuckle. I didn't hear any. Bottom line, I cannot recommend this film in good conscience to anyone, but of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",2,18,40,28 March 2018
Darkest Hour," 'You are wise because you have doubts'
","'Darkest Hour' (2017 release; 125 min.) is a movie about Winston's Churchill's initial month in office. As the movie opens. we are reminded it is '9 May 1940', with the Nazi's about to run over Holland and Belgium, and the UK looking for a new leader following Chamberlain. We get to know Churchill: working from his bed, with a stiff drink, and almost scaring away his new secretary (because she typed single-spaced). While certainly not revered by his colleagues (and oven less by King George), Winston Churchill nevertheless get his lifelong dream fulfilled and is named Prime Minister on May 10th. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from British director Joe Wright, whose previous work includes the fine 2012 remake of 'Anna Karenina'. Here, working from a script by Anthony McCarten, we get a close look at Churchill in his early days as Prime Minister. The movie covers the period of May 9-28, 1940, so this by no means meant as a definitive bio-pick f the life and times of Winston Churchill, who had an amazing and long political career, spanning 5 decades. If you hope to learn anything about Churchill's personal life, then this movie is definitely not for you (his wife Clementine appears in some scenes, and their grown-up kids in exactly 1 scene). If on the other hand you are curious how Churchill ran his War Cabinet or how Churchill dealt with King George, then this movie is very much for you. I have no idea whether all of what we see on the big screen actually happened or not (did Churchill really take that subway ride to be 'among the British people'?), but the narrative is certainly there. And there there is Gary Oldman, in the role of his life as Winston Churchill. Oldman is virtually unrecognizable under all of the heavy makeup, and instead it is as if we see Churchill in the flesh. A role like this in a movie like this, is sure to generate a LOT of nominations in the upcoming awards season (Oldman was already nominated for the Golden Globes). Comments Churchill's wife at one point: 'You are wise because you have doubts', and that about sums it up. It's apparently very lonely at the top, and riddled ith doubts. WHat a job Churchill did under the most demanding of circumstances. Last but certainly not least, as I was watching this movie, it feels like the other side of the coin to 'Dunkirk', a very different movie obviously, but covering some of the same historical ground and facts. 'Darkest Hour' is also far better than the weak 'Churchill' movie from earlier this year (starring Brian Cox).'Darkest Hours' opened on 4 screens this weekend here in Cincinnati. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at (in a fairly large theater) was absolutely jam-packed to the rafters, much to my surprise. Looks like there is a large appetite for this type of historical drama. I encourage you to check out 'Darkest Hour', be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7,0,3,24 December 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," How the rebels stole the Death Star plans
","'Rogue One' (2016 release; 133 min.) is the first stand-alone movie in the Star Wars Franchise. Others have already commented about or summarized key points of the plot so I won't go into that again and instead let me offer a couple of comments and observations.The movie is, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, directed by Gareth Edwards, best known for his so-so 2014 Godzilla franchise reboot. Here he brings to the big screen the story of how the rebels were able to steal the plans of the Death Star which was built purposefully with one fatal flaw. If you think I am 'giving away the end' of Rogue One, perhaps you are one of the few people on the planet who haven't seen Stars Wars: A New Hope. Indeed, Rogue One is set just before A New Hope, and we all know of course how A New Hope turns out plot-wise. It raises an interesting point, though, namely how to bring a movie of which you already know the ending before you enter the theater. Added to that is the fact that the viewer is not all that emotionally invested in many of these previously unknown characters. The answer, it turns out, is to bring a visually overwhelming spectacle, the likes of which we have never seen before in any Star Wars movie. The last hour of the movie, which is action-packed, is nothing short of eye-candy as we see dozens and dozens of spaceships do battle with each other, while all kinds of other mayhem is taking place around them. The lead actors are okay, in particular Felicity Jones as Jyn but even better is Mads Mikkelsen as Galen, Jyn's father and an imperial research scientist who includes the flaw in the Death Star plans. Kudos also to composer Michael Giacchino, who has the thankless task of taking over for John Williams but stands his own (and of course there are a few original Star Wars themes in the movie). Bottom line: this is an entertaining Star Wars movie, nothing more, nothing less. But I have to say that I'm REALLY looking forward to next year's Episode 8...'Rogue One' opened this weekend, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at in Cincinnati was sold out. I had bought our tickets several weeks ago, and it's a good thing I did. This movie will do mega-business at the box office, that much is clear. I was surprised to see quite a few young kids (ages 5-6-7) in the audience, and they seemed to get quite restless, which didn't surprise me one bit, as surely this is not a movie for that age category. All that aside, enjoy 'Rogue One' for what it is, Star Wars fans, and let's get ready for Episode 8!",8,1,4,18 December 2016
Passengers," Works (sort of) as a romance movie, but fails as a sci-fi action movie
","'Passengers' (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of the Starship Avalon, 'Destination: Space Colony Homestead II', we are reminded at the beginning of the movie. The 5,000+ passengers aboard are in hibernation for the 120 year journey. But when the spaceship run into a large meteorite, the hibernation pod of one of the passengers malfunctions, and wakes up a guy named Jim Preston. Alone on the giant spaceship (but for a robot bartender named Arthur), Jim tries to fix the pod (to no avail) and seems resigned to just wither away. Then he has an idea... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second Hollywood movie from Danish director Morten Tyldum, who brought us the brilliant 'Headhunters' some 4-5 years ago and soon thereafter was signed to direct 'The Imitation Game'. Here he brings us a sci-fi movie in the disguise of a romance (or perhaps it's the other way around). The best part of the movie is the first 30 min. when Jim (played by Chris Pratt) adjusts to his lonesome existence on the giant spaceship. When eventually Aurora (played by Jennifer Lawrence) joins him (sorry, can't spoil how that happens exactly), the movie becomes an outright romantic affair, a courtship set in space. 'For two unlucky people, we sure got lucky', says Aurora at some point. It isn't until the last 30 min. that the movie tries to make itself into a sci-fi action movie, but in my opinion fails to do so credibly (too many holes in the script the size of Manhattan). Michael Sheen is a pure delight as the robot bartender. The last character (played by Lawrence Fishburn) enters the plot too late to have any significant impact. On the plus side, the set and production design is top-notch, it's clear no expenses were spared (the movie sports a reported production cost of $110 million). Kudos also to Thomas Newman for the fantastic film score, which plays quasi non-stop (Imagine Dragons also contribute a new song 'Levitate' which plays over the movie's end titles). Bottom line: if you have seen the movie's trailer and are expecting an action-packed space movie, you are sure to be disappointed, as this is not that kind of movie at all.'Passengers' opened wide on Wednesday of this week. Having seen the trailer, I couldn't wait to see it. The Wednesday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. Given the onslaught of new releases as usual at the year-end, I'm guessing 'Passenger' is going to have a difficult time finding an audience. If you really want to see a space action movie, stick with 'Rogue One'. If on the other hand you are in the mood for a romantic movie, this might well do the trick for you, up to a certain level.",6,8,20,22 December 2016
Last Flag Flying," So(m)ber film is at times too obvious and too preachy
","'Last Flag Flying' (2017 release; 125 min.) brings the story of 3 Vietnam War vets. As the movie opens, we are informed it is 'December 2003', and we see a guy arriving at Sal's Bar & Grille. The bartender (and owner) Sal doesn't recognize the guy at first, but then realizes it's Doc, who served with Sal in Vietnam. After a drunken night, Doc suggests they go somewhere and Sal, not knowing what to expect, nevertheless agrees. Turns out Doc takes him to see Mueller, another Vietnam vet who now is the pastor at a Baptist church. After dinner at Mueller's house, Doc drops the bomb: his only son was killed 2 days ago in Bagdad and Doc wants Sal and Mueller to accompany him to retrieve his son's body and bury him. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-director Richard Linklater, whose 2014 masterpiece 'Boyhood' was my No. 1 movie of that year. Linklater is one of my favorite film makers, period. Here, he goes a very different direction from what he typically does, and brings an all-out sober, if not somber, account of how one guy deals with the death in combat of his son, and calling on two 'Nam buddies he hasn't seen in decades for moral and other support. And how exactly did his son die in Bagdad anyway? The war in Iraq is possibly the very worst presidential decision taken in the last 50 years, so I don't need to be told, again and again in this movie, what a lousy idea that was, so please stop the unabashed preachy tone of the movie already. Not to mention that certain moments simply feel contrived (the Dover AFB scene where Doc and Sal roll away the coffin; the TV footage of Saddam Hussein's capture, happening the very same day!, etc.). This film is the exact opposite of a feel-good movie. On the plus side, the performance of Bryan Cranston as the freewheeling Sal is spot on. I can't say the same thing for Steve Carell who as the grieving dad seems to try too hard to channel the grief and bewilderment. Bottom line: 'Last Flag Flying' is not a bad film, certainly not, but the movie's message is at times too obvious and too preachy. I can't help but think back to that other recent movie 'Thank You For Your Service', which didn't shout in your face how horrible the war in Iraq has been (or its aftermath for returning veterans), but instead lets the story do the talking without resorting to the obvious and the preaching. We get it.'Last Flag Flying' opened recently at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati (and it being an Amazon Studios film, it simultaneously started streaming on Amazon). The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (about 10 people in all). I can't say that when I walked out from the theater I felt good about having seen this film. I certainly encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6,1,9,13 December 2017
Green Room," Intense horror-thriller will grab you from start to finish
","'Green Room' (2015 release; 94 min.) brings the (mis)adventures of four musicians in a punk band called the Ain't Rights As the movie opens, we see the four of them waking up in their van, after the van slid off the road the night before. It's not long before they meet up with a local radio show host, who is able to book them onto a nearby concert the next day. When the band gets there, they realize that this is a show for Nazi skinheads. When they open their set with a cover of a Dead Kennedys' anti-Nazi tune, the audience gets very restless. Things only get worse from there... At this point we're about 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Jeremy Saulnier, who most recently brought us the excellent 'Blue Ruin'. Here, he brings a very different story, namely what happens to a punk band when they accidentally end up performing for Nazi skinheads, and things turn sour (in a very unexpected way--sorry, I cannot reveal more). As soon as the band starts their gig, the movie's tension rackets up and simply never lets go from there until the very end. The cast is an ensemble of no-names, at least for me, with of course the exception of Patrick Stewart. Stewart plays the role of the leader of the Nazi skinheads, and he brings it with ice-cold detachment and ruthlessness. Beware: there are a couple of pretty gruesome scenes, so if that is not your thing, by all means stay away from it. if on the other hand you like a true original horror-thriller story, you are in for quite a treat. Last but not least, there is an excellent soundtrack, both from the original score (composed by Brooke Blair and Will Blair), and also the various songs interwoven into the music. When CCR's 'Sinister Purpose' starts playing over the movie's end credits, it brings a sense of relief, as in: you made it alive through the end! Which is more than can be said for a number of the characters in the movie...'Green Room' premiered at Cannes 2015, exactly a year ago, to critical acclaim. No idea why it's taken this long to get a theatrical release but better late than never I suppose. 'Green Room' opened on 3 or 4 screens in Greater Cincinnati this past weekend. The early evening screening where I saw this at the other day was attended okay but not great, somewhat to my surprise. In you are in the mood for a top-notch horror-thriller, you cannot go wrong with this. 'Green Room' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,3,12,5 May 2016
Us," Neither scary nor funny, and nowhere near as good as 'Get Out'
","'Us' (2019 release; 116 min.) brings the story of Adelaide and her family. As the movie opens, the screen informs us that 'there are many tunnels out there, with no known purpose'. We are told it is 'Santa Cruz, 1986', and young Adelaide and her parents are at the amusement park, Adelaide drifts away from the park and end up in a hall or mirrors, where strange things start happening. We then switch to the 'Present Day': Adelaide is now married and they have 2 kids, Zora and Jason. They are on their way to their vacation house near Santa Cruz. Husband Gabe talks her into going to the very same beach where Adelaide had that strange encounter, and Adelaide reluctantly gives in, as long as they come back before sunset. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the new movie from writer-director Jordan Peele, who surprised the world (and himself) with his fantastic debut film 'Get Out' (for which he deservedly won an Oscar for Original Screenplay). 'Us' has equally been getting high praise, and to be honest, I am dumbfounded by it. I couldn't make heads or tails of the movie. It is not a scary movie. It is not a funny movie. So what is it then? Is this supposed to be some social commentary of sorts? If so, I have missed the message completely. Here is what I think: this movie purports to be 'high art' but in fact falls far short of that. And then there is that stupid ending, which makes NO SENSE whatsoever, and simply made me wonder what the heck I just spent watching for the last two hours. It's a darn shame of all that talent that goes into the making of such a movie.I was on the fence of going to see the movie but ultimately gave in when it became available on my MoviePass account. The Monday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (5 people, including myself). Of course the movie by now has been out for a month, so that is to be expected. Bottom lime: I just didn't care for this movie, but of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",3,1,2,23 April 2019
Knives Out," It's okay but I don't understand the hype
","'Knives Out' (2019 release; 130 min.) looks at the demise of Harlan Thrombey, the 85 yr. old patriarch and successful novelist. As the movie opens, the housekeeper finds him dead on a couch, an apparent suicide. We then go to 'One Week After the Demise of Harlan Thrombey', as the police have gathered several people for interrogating them as to what exactly has happened, including Marta, the nurse caretaker, Linda, the patriarch's daughter, and Richard, Linda's husband. We soon are introduced to yet more central characters... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from writer-director Rian Johnson, best known for directing the 2017 'Star Wars - Tee Last Jedi'. Here he brings us a murder mystery in line with those 'who dunnit' mysteries from Agatha Christie and the like. Much of the movie takes place in the patriarch's Massachusetts house and in that sense the movie feels very much like a theater plat at times. It takes a nit of work to fully understand who is who and who may have done what. All if it is tied together by Daniel Craig's character, a private investigator who was hired by someone in the family (but we don't know who). I am not spoiling anything when I say that it is absolutely impossible to figure out who the true culprit(s) is/are, so you just sit back and wait for the last 20 min. or so when all is revealed. Marts is played by rapidly riding Cuban actress Ana de Armas, whom we also saw in 'Yesterday' not long ago, and will seemingly be everywhere in 2020. Jamie Lee Curties has a second-tier role as Linda, as does Don Johnson as Richard. And Christopher Plummer has an even smaller role as the patriarch. Please note that the movie's title is indeed taken from the Radiohead song of the same name (Rian Johnson being a huge Radiohead fan), but that's where the connection stops (the Radiohead song does not play in the movie).'Knives Out' premiered at this Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to positive reaction and opened wide in late November. The movie has performed much better than expected at the box office, being a genuine box office hit, and it is currently also rated 97% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. I really didn't plan on seeing this but seeing those numbers and sky-high ratings made me change my mind. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (a good 30 people in a small theater). After all this, I'm sorry, but am I missing something? I mean, sure, this is a pleasant divertisment, nothing less, nothing more (for me anyway). But this is just okay and nowhere near as good as a bunch of other films I have seen this year (Apollo 11, The Mustang, The Lighthouse, The Report, The Two Popes, The Irishman, The Peanut Butter Falcon, Parasite, Waves, Richard Jewell, etc.). Of course I encourage you to check it our, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",5,3,7,16 December 2019
The Irishman," Martin Scorsese's latest mob drama is great but will test your endurance
","'The Irishman' (2019 release; 209 min.) brings the story of Frank Sheeran. as the movie opens, the camera scans through a seniors home and eventually finds Frank, who begins to tell his story. We then go back in time to 1975, when Frank and his wife, along with Russ and his wife, are getting ready for a road trip from Phillie to attend a wedding in Detroit. We then go further back in tine how Frank and Russ first met... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest opus from director Martin Scorsese. This movie has been in development hell for YEARS (over a decade, in fact), but when the right elements finally lined up, Scorsese and his team made the most of it. Robert de Niro (as Frank) has been pushing this project from day 1 and is masterful in the role of Frank, whom we follow over a period of 4 decades or so, from his early days getting involved in the Phillie mafia to his time with Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa (played masterfully by Al Pacinco). But the best performance comes from Joe Pesci (as Russ). As we see this mobster/union power struggle play out, it's never clear who has the final say, and Scorsese doesn't attempt to resolve the issue, and we are left to make our own conclusions. Much as been made about the movie's 3 1/2 hr. running time (without an intermission, I might add) , and truth be told, the movie could've easily trimmed a good 20-30 min. without losing any of its essence. But then again, who can argue with Scorsese? or de Niro?'The Irishman' opened this weekend in a very limited theatrical release (before moving the Netflix by the end of the month), and I couldn't be happier that my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was one of those theaters. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was PACKED to the rafters, to no one's surprise. I quite liked it, even if the movie is a bit overly long for its own good. If you are in the mood for another serving of Martin Scorsese-Robert de Niro-Al Pacino-Joe Pesci mobster drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",8,9,25,17 November 2019
Point Break," Unnecessary remake but enjoyable extreme sports action scenes
","'Point Break' (2015 release from US/China; 113 min.) opens with a crazy sequence, where we see a couple of bike riders attempt an outrageous stunt, only for it to end in tragedy. We are then told 'Seven Years Later', and our hero is now in the FBI Academy. Before we know it, he is off to infiltrate a group that is, well, I'm not going to tell you. At this point, we're 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience.Couple of comments: first, while there is of course a plot that guides the movie (and the plot is only in spirit connected to the original Point Break), I have to say that the plot doesn't matter in the least. Why? Because let's face it, we are here to see what crazy stunts the film makers can pull off, while making us believe that they are real. And do they? Yes, they certainly do, although I can't tell to what extent the stunts are real or fake. For example, the free solo rock climb at Angel Falls in Venezuela: if that was real, that was pure insanity, period. Second, this movie is mostly by a no-name crew. The only names that jumps out to me include Kurt Wimmer, who wrote the script (and previously wrote the script for Salt and the remake of Total Recall), and Junkie XL, who composed the movie's score. Third, this is a US-Chinese co-production, as in: the Chinese (through DMG China) put up a lot of the money for this movie. When you watch the film, it was clear this was an expensive production (filming in India, Italy, Austria, Venezuela, Tahiti, Hawaii, Utah, and other places), so curiosity got the better of me and I looked up what this movie cost. I almost fell out of my chair when I read that the production budget was over $100 million (and that's not counting the marketing budget). Did anyone even ask for this remake? I was on the fence about seeing this,but curiosity for the action scenes got the better of me so I went to see it during the New Year's holidays. The early evening screening where I saw this at in Fort Myers was attended okay but not great. If you are a sucker/addict for extreme sports, you may want to check this out. If not, there honestly is no reason whatsoever to see this movie.",6,0,2,13 January 2016
Spotlight," outstanding investigative journalism movie (reminiscent of All the PResident's Men)
","'Spotlight' (2015 release; 128 min.) brings the true story of how the Boston Globe eventually broke the story of the widespread abuse of young children by Boston priests while the Catholic Church stood by and covered it up. As the movie opens, we are in 'Boston, MA - 1976', where we see a priest being accused of abuse. 'Wait until the arraignment, the press will be all over it', comments one cop. 'What arraignment?', replies the other cop. We then fast-forward to 'July, 2001', and we get to know the 4 member Spotlight, an investigative reporting team at the Boston Globe. The Globe also has just gotten a new editor, Marty Baron, 'an unmarried Jewish guy who doesn't like baseball' (the implication being he's no fit for Boston). But it's not long before Baron picks up on a recent column about abuse by Boston priests, and he orders Spotlight to look into it. At this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer and sometimes director Tom McCarthy (he won an Oscar for writing 'UP'), and I have to say, 'Spotlight' is the giant leap forward as a director, and he has now placed himself in the upper ranks of today's directors. The trick with these movies is: how can the director brings a movie, whose outcome we already know going in, and still capture our attention? It was the same question faced by the makers of 'All The President's Men', of course, and in fact 'Spotlight' very much reminds me of 'All The President's Men': top-notch all the way, and it feels like a thriller as you're watching it. At one point, someone comments 'it takes a village to raise a child, and it takes a village to abuse a child', pinpointing the collective failing of all of Boston for so many years. The abuse of power and influence of the Catholic Church is simply appalling. Kudos to the various performers, including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachael McAdams, Stanley Tucci, and Liev Schreiber, just to name those. They all bring powerful performances. Last but not least, there is a nice orchestral score from Hollywood veteran composer Howard Shore. If 'Spotlight' does somewhat okay at the box office, I think that this movie will be in line for a bunch of nominations and even awards in the upcoming awards season.The movie recently opened nationally in the theater. The early evening screening where I saw this at in Ft. Myers, FL was reasonably attended but by no means a sell-out. I truly hope that this movie finds an audience, not just because it covers an important issue but most of all because it is one heck of a movie. IF you liked 'All the President's Men', drop everything and go see this. 'Spotlight' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",9,4,9,24 November 2015
Youth," Abstract movie about life is wistful but never sentimental
","'Youth' (2015 release from Italy; original title 'La giovinezza'; 124 min.) brings the story of Fred Ballinger (played by Michael Caine), an 80-something retired classical musician and orchestra director. Ballinger is on extended holiday in the Swiss Alps, along with his friend of 60 years, movie director Mick Boyle (played by Harvey Keitel), and Fred's daughter Lena (played by Racheal Weisz). As the movie opens, Fred is in discussion with someone from Buckingham Palace informing him the Queen wants to honor and knight him, if only in return he'll conduct his 'Simple Songs', which Fred resolutely refuses (we later learn why). Meanwhile, we learn that Fred's daughter Lena and Mick's son Julien are married but divorcing. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Italian director Paolo Sorrentino, who a couple of years ago won the Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar for 'The Great Beauty' (which in my book was overrated), and before that brought us that weird Sean Penn vehicle 'This Must Be the Place', among others. Here, Sorrentino goes in a very different direction, brings us two old guys who reflect back on their lives, wondering what is left in store for them. There really is no substantive plot to speak of, just a collection of abstract, if visually gorgeous, tableaux of what is happening at the Swiss Alps spa-resort. The movie's pulse is of course Michael Caine's masterful performance as the retired orchestra conductor, whom we learn (among others from a raging monologue from his daughter Lena) has quite a troubled past as a husband and a father. There are many other noteworthy performances, including from Paul Dano, whom we saw earlier this year as Brian Wilson in 'Love and Mercy', and here is plays the frustrated actor whom people only remember for one role (as the robot 'Mr. Q'). But wait... there is more! Deep into the second half of the film, Jane Fonda makes a memorable entrée (as the old school actress Brenda Morel), and her 10 min. role is already garnering Best Supporting Actress Oscar buzz. Any discussion of 'Youth' would be incomplete without mentioning the fabulous soundtrack, both the classical score (courtesy of David Lang), and the songs, the best ones being courtesy of Sun Kil Moon's Mark Kozelek. His track 'Ceiling Gazing' (which also played prominently in the movie's trailer) is the emotional lynchpin of the movie: wistful, but not sentimental. (The soundtrack is available here on Amazon.) I recently caught 'Youth' over the year-end holidays in Ft. Myers at what turned out to be its very last screening as the next day the movie was gone. The screening I saw this at was attended okay (mostly by seniors, I might add). This movie is slow-moving (in the best possible way), and as a result I can't see this reaching a large audience in the theater. Perhaps if Caine gets an Oscar nomination (and he certainly deserves one) it is possible that this movie finds a second breath in the theater, perhaps not. Regardless, I found it to be a fantastic movie, and would encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. 'Youth' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,0,1,12 January 2016
Ready Player One," CGI dazzles but the movie's characters lack depth
","'Ready Player One' (2018 release; 140 min.) brings the story of Wade. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is 'Columbus, Ohio, 2045, The Stacks', as we get to know Wade, a 17 year old living with his aunt. Wade, like many, spends a lot of time in a virtual reality world called the Oasis. In the Oasis Wade is known as Parzival. Before long, we learn that Halliday, the deceased co-creator of the Oasis, has left an Easter Egg hidden in the Oasis (and along with it, ownership of the Oasis and a half trillion dollars), which can be retrieved upon collecting three keys. The Oasis avatars are keen on finding the treasure, and that includes shady characters from IOI, a competitor of the Oasis. Who will find the Easter Egg? What becomes of Wade/Parzival? At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: let me admit right upfront that if it weren't for the fact that this movie is directed by Steven Spielberg, I doubt that I would've gone to see it. Spielberg is perhaps the leading director of the last 40+ years, and I will always respect what he does/give him a chance. This is the big screen adaptation of the novel by Ernest Cline, which I have not read (and hence an in no position to comment how widely the movie diverges from the book--if at all). The movie is at its essence a nostalgic trip down into the 70s and 80s, when simple(r) computer games ruled (Atari, etc.). Long stretches of the movie play out entirely within the Oasis, and hence are purely CGI. And I'll admit it: these are at times dazzling, and always entertaining, sequences Check out the initial car race in Manhattan, with King Kong at the gatekeeper of the finish line. And with that, we are also on a treasure hunt of pop culture references, the likes of which I cannot recall having seen before. Sure, other movies have dabbled into that as well, but surely no movie has the sheer amount of them that 'Ready Player One'. I caught quite a few, but I'm sure there are tons of others that I simply didn't have the time to see. (Apparently the production team spent several years negotiating to get the licensing rights for all of these pop culture references.) My favorite sequence comes when Parzival and his friends find themselves in the setting of Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' while looking for a clue to the next key. Sheer fun! However, once we are back in the real world, the movie suffers from poor character development. The movie's characters lack depth in every which way, and hence I have no emotional attachment or investment in any of them. In that sense, the movie is really just eye-candy, nothing more, nothing less, and I believe that a tighter edit of the movie (cutting its running time from the current excessively long 2 hrs. 20 min,) would've benefited the movie too. The movie features a ton of great music, both as to song placements (with lost of classic rock from the 70s and 80s) and the original score (courtesy of composer Alan Silvestri).'Ready Player One' opened wide on Thursday (after previews on Wednesday evening). The Thursday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (but by no means sold out). As the end credits started rolling, the audience burst out in a spontaneous applause. Don't get me wrong: I liked 'Ready Player One' for what it was, a nostalgic trip down into a simpler video gaming era, crammed with so many pop culture references that it will take several viewing to catch them all. But in the end, watching the movie is like watching a video game, literally. I encourage you to check out 'Ready Player One', be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6,5,12,30 March 2018
"I, Tonya"," 'I was loved... for a minute'
","'I, Tonya' (2017 release; 121 min.) is a bio-pic about the life and times of (in)famous figure skater Tonya Harding. As the movie opens, we are reminded the movie is 'based on irony-free, wildly contradicting and totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly'. After some current-day interview excerpts of them and others, we then go back to 'Portland, Oregon 40 Years Ago', where we get to know Tonya as a 4 year old, along with her all-too-soon absent father and her abusive mother, the latter pushing Tonya into figure skating. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself hoe it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Craig Gillespie, who most recently brought us the excellent 'Their Finest Hours'. Here, in conjunction with Margot Robbie's production company, he brings the 'truth' as to what 'really' happened in 1994, when Nancy Kerrigan was whacked on the knee in the run-up of the upcoming nationals and then Olympics. But the movie is about so much more than that. Harding was 'white trash', as was everyone around her. It breaks your heart to see her being abused, physically and psychologically, time and again, by the people around her, when all she really wants is some TLC. 'I was loved... for a minute', laments Harding on more than one occasion. The movie's approach is wild, and wildly entertaining, where characters address the audience directly on numerous occasions. Margot Robbie is outstanding in the title role. Is that really Robbie in the skating sequences? If so, wow... But equally impressive is Allison Janney in the utterly unlikable role as Tonya's abusive mom. How can a mother end up so cruel as to her own daughter? It's a topic worth examining further in and of itself... The movie features a ton of great song placements, which only increase the viewing experience in the best possible way. 'I, Tonya' is clearly inn line to do quite well in the upcoming awards season, and deservedly so (Janney already won a Golden Globe for her performance).'I, Tonya' premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim, and is now finally getting a wider release. The Thursday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay (for a weekday evening). I can only imagine that this movie will benefit from the sure positive word-of-mouth that audiences will give this. If you are in the mood for a wildly entertaining bio-pic about a controversial figure skater who never stood a chance, be it in figure skating or in life for that matter, you will not want to miss this. 'I, Tonya' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,3,5,19 January 2018
Molly's Game," Fast paced true (if unlikely) story benefits from the 'Aaron Sorkin treatment'
","'Molly's Game' (2017 release; 140 min.) brings the story of Molly Bloom. As the movie opens, we watch Molly compete in the Salt Lake Olympic trials for freestyle skiing, seemingly poised to make the team, only to see her hopes dashed resulting from an improbable twig on the course. We then go to '12 Years Later, West Hollywood', where we find Molly being woken up by FBI agents who are at her apartment's door. Molly is arrested for running an illegal gambling operation. We then go back in time, as we see Molly arriving in LA after the Olympic trials, figuring out what she wants to do with her life. How did Molly get involved in illegal gambling? At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the highly anticipated directing debut from writer Aaron Sorkin, whose previous script work includes 'The Social Network' (for which he won an Oscar), 'Moneyball' and 'Steve Jobs', just to name those. Here he adapts Molly Bloom's memoir 'Molly's Game' for the big screen. I read the memoir when it came out in 2014, and it was as unlikely a story as it was fascinating and entertaining. That Sorkin ends up writing/directing this movie makes perfect sense, as it feels entirely in line with some of his earlier work. The movie's frantic pace is nothing short of dizzying at times, and I was concerned that it would be unsustainable. But after that initial wave, the movie does slow down just enough that we settle in for what I can only term as a wild, wild ride. It blows the mind that all of this in fact did happen in real life. Jessica Chastain is masterful in the title role. Idris Elba as her (initially reluctant) lawyer is also quite good. Kevin Costner plays her dad (and psychologist), in a smaller role that cries out for more details but with a running time of well over 2 hours already, there apparently was no room to dig deeper into that. 'The addiction is having power over powerful men', Costner's character tells Molly. Bottom line is that 'Molly's Game' is a wickedly entertaining and fast-moving film that will at times overwhelm you. Just buckle up and enjoy!'Molly's Game' opened in select theaters this weekend. The early evening screening on New Year's Day where I saw this at was absolutely packed to the rafters, somewhat to my surprise. The audience gave a spontaneous applause when the movie's end titles started to roll. This movie surely will generate positive word of mouth. If you are in the mood for a true story that is stranger than fiction, featuring some stellar acting performances, and all served up in the usual 'Aaron Sorkin way', you cannot go wrong with this, and I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",7,1,3,2 January 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Spike Lee's timely political movie
","'BlacKkKlansman' (2018 release; 135 min,) brings the (true) story of Ron Stllworth. As the movie opens, we get a clip from Gone With the Wind, the famous scene where Scarlett walks among the hundreds, if not thousands of wounded soldiers, with the camera eventually catching the Confederate flag. After that, we are introduced to Ron Stallworth, an African-American interviewing for, and getting, a job on the Colorado Springs Police Department, the first African-American to do so (we are in 1974, as we see 'Re-elect Nixon' signs). The Department is blatantly racist on many levels. After a rough start, Stallworth asks, and gets, to be assigned as an undercover cop. Then one day, he sees an ad for the local chapter of the KKK in the local newspaper, and decides to call the telephone number in the ad. Much to his surprise, he makes headway in the KKK's local chapter... At this time we are less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: writer-director Spike Lee has known many ups and downs in his 3+ decade career, and this surely is one of the ups. Taking an obscure fait diver from 40+ years ago (a back man infiltrating the KKK!), Lee builds it into a timely political movie about today's leadership in Washington. Yes, let's just say it: David Duke, featured prominently, is projected as a precursor of the current POTUS. 'Make America great again!', and later 'America first' are used in the film. If it looks a bit heavy-handed, it frankly is. The movie benefits greatly from the charming performances by its leads, John David Washington as Ron Stallworth and Adam Driver as fellow undercover cop Flip Zimmerman (and stand-in Ron Stallworth). Laura Harrier has a breakout performance as Stallworth's romantic interest. On the negative side, the movie's running time is way, way too long (by a good 20-30 min.). Yet all that said, none of this would matter if it weren't for the last 5 min. of the movie, which all brings it home so pointedly (no worries, I won't spoil). You could hear a pin drop in the theater where I saw this during the movie's conclusion...'BlacKkKlansman' premiered at this year's Cannes film festival to immediate acclaim (it won the Grand Prix), and was released wide this weekend. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was PACKED. Given the inherently controversial nature of this film, I have no idea whether this will be a box office smash, but that isn't even the main point. If you have any interest it the racial divide that exists in this country, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7,61,150,11 August 2018
Begin Again," 'Once' twice: does lightning strike again?
","'Begin Again' (2013 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Greta (played by Keira Knightley) and Dan (played by Marc Ruffalo). As the movie opens, we find Greta reluctantly going on stage in a small bar venue to play a song, urged on by a friend. By complete coincidence Dan, a veteran of the music business, is in the audience, and loves what he's hearing. We later learn the background of how these two characters ended up in that very place, as things have not been going as planned (and I'm being mild). Dan tells her he wants to record an album with/for her. Along the way we get to know the side characters (Dan's wife and 14 yr. old daughter--both estranged from Dan), and Dave (played by Maroon 5's Adam Levine), Greta's boyfriend who has just hit the big time. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: as a general matter and contrary to apparently many other reviewers, I did not 'fall' for this movie like I did for 'Once', writer-director John Carney's previous tale of romance and music. In fact, when it comes down to it, this movie is nothing more that a re-imagined 'Once', set in a different city and with different leads, but in the end it is nothing more than a variation of what we've already seen. Lightning does not strike again: as sincere and moving and impossible Once was, as contrived and unoriginal and self-evident Begin Again is. There are still a couple of great scenes in the movie, reason I'm giving it 5 stars out of 10, and which I cannot describe in more details so as not to give away anything.And then just when you've think you've seen it all, comes the ending of the movie. Wow, just wow. The irony of it all. (For more details, please see my comments in the movie's discussion threat here on IMDb, under 'The Ending (spoilers obviously)'.",5,36,68,15 July 2014
Black Mass," Solid mobster crime drama with a stellar Johnny Depp
","'Black Mass' (2015 release; 122 min.) brings the story of James 'Whitey' Bulger (played by Johnny Depp), the infamous Boston mobster. As the movie opens, we see one of Bulger's associates strike a deal with the FBI to spill everything ('I want it on record, I'm not a rat', ha!). We then flash back to '1975, South Boston', and we get to know Bulger and his small circle of trusted associates. In a parallel story, we get to know FBI agent John Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton), also a 'Southie' who has just returned to Boston. Connolly convinces Bulger to become an FBI informant (which Bulger hopes will help him eliminate the rival mobsters from North Boston). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, the is the latest movie from up-and-coming director Scott Cooper, who earlier brought us the excellent films 'Crazy Heart' (2009) and 'Out of the Furnace' (2013). Unlike those movies, he did not write the script for 'Black Mass' not thought up the story (the film is based on the book of the same name). That does not diminish Cooper's merits with this one, as Cooper strikes the right tone and brings us a gritty and hard-as-nails crime drama. If tough language (the F bomb drops frequently) or violence (yes, people will get hurt and killed), then do yourself a favor and stay away from this. The best part of the movie for me is as we see the noose getting tighter and tighter around Bulger's neck (figuratively speaking) and options are starting to diminish. Second, the performance from Johnny Depp is nothing short of stellar, reconfirming our (ebbing) belief that this is a top notch actor,. It makes you cringe just thinking of some of the other recent movies he's done ('Mordecai', anyone?). Depp is almost unrecognizable as the infamous mobster. There are a TON of other noteworthy performances, including from Kevin Bacon (as the head of the Boston FBI), but also Adam Scott as another FBI agent, Benedict Cumberbatch as Billy Bulger (the bother who was a state senator), and Dakota Johnson as Bulger's girlfriend. Solid work all around. Kudos as well to the production team for painstakingly recreating the late 70s/early 80s, making the movie a true period piece. Be sure to stick around when the end credits start rolling, as we get a bunch of archive video footage and pictures from the real people, just fascinating.I had been looking forward to seeing this. The movie opened this weekend and I went to see it right away. the early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was very well attended, somewhat to my surprise, given the tough nature of the movie. With the summer blockbusters in the rearview mirror, maybe people are ready for something completely altogether. 'Black Mass' surely is that. If you are in the mood for a tough crime drama featuring Johnny Depp at its best, you cannot go wrong with this. 'Black Mass' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,2,8,19 September 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Exposing the ugly underbelly of a small Midwestern town
","'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' (2017 release; 115 min.) brings the story of Mildred Hayes. As the movie opens, we see her driving by several unused dilapidated billboards near her house. She inquires with the Ebbing Advertising Agency (located across the street from the Police Department), and decides to put up three billboards. Combined, they read: Raped While Dying/And Still No Arrests'/How Come. Chief Willoughby? We learn that her daughter Angela was murdered 7 months ago, and that no suspects have been identified by the cops. OF course, this public shaming does not sit well with Chief Willoughby, and he decides to pay Mildred a visit (his first since the murder, Mildred remarks). At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Martin McDonagh, who previously gave us 'In Bruges' and 'Seven Psychopaths'. While those movies were over the top in many ways, here McDonagh goes a more subtle yet still hard-hitting way in looking at how one strong-willed woman upsets the fabric of a little Missouri town and along the way exposes its ugly underbelly. If you have seen the movie's trailer (and it was hard to escape that in recent weeks), one might expect something very similar, at least in style, to McDonagh's earlier movies, rip-roaring from start to finish. But that is not the case at all. Yes, of course there are those moments, but there there are also many other scenes in the movie that are reflective and outright touching. As hard-boiled as Mildred seems to be, the real hurt and grieving she displays on occasion says a lot more about her than when she kicks some school kids in a place where it hurts (yes, she really does). McDonagh brings out wonderful performances, none more so than the one-of-a- kind Frances McDormand as Mildred. McDormand must at this point surely be considered the front-runner for the Best Actress Oscar early next year. But she gets plenty of help, including Sam Rockwell (as the sleazy and racist officer Dixon), and Woody Harrelson (as Chief Willoughby),'Three Billboards' premiered this Fall to immediate critical acclaim, which for the most part is well deserved. (I personally felt a bit let down by the movie's concluding 15 min., which of course I will not spoil.) The Thanksgiving early evening screening where I saw this at in Ft. Myers FL, was attended nicely (about 15- 20 people) but nowhere near a sell-out. It will be interesting to see how the movie does at the box office as it gets a wider release in weeks to come. Martin McDonagh is certainly no ordinary writer- director and if you appreciate hiss off-kilter approach, you will welcome his latest. I encourage you to check out 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri', be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7,3,8,24 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Kind of a mess, but still a beautiful mess
","'Star War - The RIse of Skywalker' (2019 release; 142 min.) is the 9th and last (?) chapter in the original Star Wars sage, always envisioned by creator George Lucas to run over 9 chapters.Couple of comments: to say that The Rise of Skywalker has gone through development hell would be a major understatement. Rian Johnson, who had directed The Last Jedi, was to write the script but he came and went. Even more troubling was that Colin Trevorrow was bought on as director, but he eventually (a year into this) was dismissed, following unresolvable 'creative differences' with producer Kathleen Kennedy. What next? J.J. Abrams (who directed The Force Awakens) to the rescue! As to the film itself, I have to say that the first half of The Rise of Skywalker is a mess, frankly. I had no idea what in the world was going on. Particularly keeping in mind the final scene of The Last Jedi, you'd think that we's find out what happened when Ren meets Luke Skywalker in that scene. But noooo... It's as if that never even happened. Instead there are so many other things going on that it is impossible (for me anyway) to wrap your arms around it. To Abrams' credit, the second half of The Rise of Skywalker is much, much better, once we finally understand to what kind of a final showdown we are working towards. The space action scenes (of which there are surprisingly few, considering everything) are 'out of this world', pun intended. Where there once were some battleships in, say, A New Hope, there are now, literally, HUNDREDS of them, swarming like a bunch of mosquitoes. And the final, final scene is a worthy one too. (Please also note that composer John Williams, now a crops 87 yrs. young, already has announced that no matter what, this is his final Star Wars movie. Say it ain't so!'Star Wars - The Rise of Skywalker' opened a week ago, and we finally went to see it on Christmas day. The early evening screening where we saw this at in a mid-size theater here in Cincinnati was sold out to the last seat. But in the bigger picture, The Rise of Skywalker has not done well--taht is, within the context of the Star Wars universe. And let me ask this: given the enormous financial stakes for Disney, does anyone really believe that we have seen the last of Ray, Finn, Poe, C-3PO, Chewbakka, and the rest of the gang? I personally don't believe for a minute that The Rise of Skywalker was really the last of the 'original' Star Wars trilogy of trilogies. Bottom line: The Rise of Skywalker is a bit of a mess, but still a beautiful mess for Star War fans alike, be they long time fans and new fans. Of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6,2,13,27 December 2019
Lion," Riveting first half but movie loses luster in second half
","'Lion' (2016 release from Australia; 118 min.) is 'based on a true story', we are reminded at the beginning of the film, and brings the incredible story of Saroo. As the movie opens, we are in 'Khandwa, India, 1986', and we see 5 yr. old Saroo and his older brother doing whatever they need to do to get by, hustling and bustling. During one of their outings, they get separated and Saroo mistakenly ends up on a train bound for Calcutta, 1000 mi. away. He desperately looks for his mom and his brother, to no avail (for one thing, the boy speaks Hindi and not Bengali), and eventually ends up being adopted by a couple in Tasmania, Australia... To tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is the big screen adaptation of Saroo's memoir 'A Long Way Home', and is directed by Australian newcomer Garth Davis. The movie can be roughly divided into two parts: in the initial 50 or so minutes, we follow the young Saroo as he gets separated from his family and eventually ends up in Calcutta. The second half of the movie brings us the grown-up Saroo, now fully integrated in Hobart, Tasmania in his adopted family. I personally LOVED the first half of the movie, which is truly heartbreaking as we follow young Saroo. There is little dialogue to speak of (remember, Saroo doesn't speak or understand Bengali), and in a way this is the truest survivor story you will ever see. The young actor portraying 5 yr. old Saroo is nothing short of sensational. The photography is gorgeous throughout. Things are not nearly as interesting in the movie's second half. Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire; Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) portrays the grown-up Saroo, and does so with pained passion. The same cannot be said of Rooney Mara's performance. I love most of the stuff she does, but here she looks strangely aloof in the proceedings, like she wasn't interested at all in this role (other than it being filmed on location in Tasmania). Nicole Kidman plays the adoptive mother. And am I the only one who was bothered with the way the movie becomes one long advert for Google Earth? On the plus side, there is an outstanding orchestral score, courtesy of Hauschka (!) and Dustin O'Halloran which I intend on seeking out (the movie also features a brand new Sia song 'Never Gives Up' which plays over the end credits). A few weeks ago I heard an interview on NPR with the real life Saroo, discussing the film (and unfortunately giving away the entire story including how it all ends). Despite that, I was eager to see the movie.'Lion' opened at the Toronto International Film Festival to good critical acclaim, and it finally opened in theaters in late December. The New Year's weekend matinée screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely. I thought that the first half of the movie was nothing short of riveting, if heartbreaking, but the second half of the movie is too obvious and predictive too keep my attention all the way through. Still, this is an incredible story that is worth seeking out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",6,46,81,4 January 2017
The Lost City of Z," Better than average explorer-adventure movie
","'The Lost City of Z' (2016 release from the UK; 141 min.) brings the true story of British explorer Percy Fawcett. As the movie opens, we are told it is 'Cork, Ireland, 1905', and we get to know Major Fawcett and his wife Nina. Even though he wins the prestigious deer hunt event, he isn't highly regarded ('he choose the wrong ancestors', sneers one). The next year, Fawcett is transferred to the Royal Geographical Society in London, and it isn't long before Fawcett is asked/offered the opportunity to settle a border dispute between Bolivia and Brazil. Off he goes, and the adventure of a lifetime awaits. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the big screen adaptation of the book of the same name, directed by James Gray (best known for his film 'The Immigrant' a few years ago). Here, Gray gets the opportunity to bring an epic adventure to life. Indeed, once the story settles in South America, one cannot escape the gorgeous photography. But thankfully it's not just eye-candy, as the story telling is quite solid. In particular the second half of the movie soars, as we see what becomes of the quest for this legendary location. Along the way, we even get treated to a tough episode in WWI, shot with a veracity that rings true. Charlie Hunnam in the lead role of Percy Fawcett gets his meatiest role to date, and Sienna Miller is quite good as his wife Nina. But the big surprise is surely Robert Pattinson, unrecognizable as Fawcett's sidekick Henry Costin (it's only when I saw the end credits roll that I realized this was Pattinson). Last but not least, Christopher Spelman delivers a rousing orchestral score,'The Lost City of Z' premiered last Fall at the New York Film Festival. It finally opened in theaters this weekend, I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, somewhat to my surprise. If you are in the mood for a better than average exploration adventure movie, I'd readily recommend you check out 'The Lost City of Z', be it in theaters, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",7,2,4,22 April 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Rami Malek does a great Freddie Mercury, but...
","'Bohemian Rhapsody' (2018 release; 135 min.) is a bio-pic of the British band Queen, an in particular focuses on the lead singer Freddie Mercury (RIP). As the movie opens, we see Freddie waking up and getting ready to perform on Live Aid. We then go back to 'London, 1970'. Freddie has another argument with his parents, and heads out to catch a show. Ut happens to be Smile, with Brian on guitar and Roger on drums. That very night, Smile's led singer quits, and Freddie, who gives an impromptu audition, manages to convince Brian and Roger to take him in. It's not long before John joins as well, and Freddie renames the band Queen. In a parallel story, Freddie falls for a sweet girl named Mary... At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie has been in development for years and years. It ultimately was directed by Bryan Singer, best known for his with with in the X-men franchise. Here he brings 15 years in the band Queen to the big screen. Please note he was fired as director before completion of the film. Whoever made the decision to cast Rami Malek in the role of Freddie Mercury should take a big bow, as Malek is absolutely fantastic, as if Freddie Mercury has come alive again. Of course the music is top-notch. That said, there are a number of issues that bother me. First and foremost, for reasons that care incomprehensible (actually: so as to make the movie as commercially accessible as possible), this is a PG-13 movie, and hence we get a strongly filtered version of the band and of Freddie Mercury. Freddie's battle with AIDS is barerly touched upon, for one. Next, there are a number of unexplained gaffes in the movie: the movie makes it look like Queen hadn't played together in forever before doing LiveAid. That is simply untrue (the band did a long tour of Australia and Japan just months before LiveAid.) Then we see the band perform 'Fat Bottomed Girls' on their first US tour (in 1974). Except that 'Fat Bottomed Girls' was a hit single from Queen's 1978 album 'Jazz', and was never played before 1978. Need I go on? As a life-long Queen fan who saw them in concert in 1978 and 1980 (arguably at the band's peak) in Belgium (where I grew up), 'Bohemian Rhapsody' leaves me unfulfilled, I'm sorry to say. It should've been the definitive film about Freddie and the rest of Queen, but for me it's not. Thankfully Rami Malek's performance makes up for some of it.'Bohemian Rhapsody' opened wide this weekend. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely. If you have any interest in the music of Queen and/or the person that was Freddie Mercury, I encourage you to check it out, be it in theaters, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6,3,6,3 November 2018
Baby Driver," When plot becomes irrelevant: style (and music) over matter
","'Baby Driver' (2017 release; 113 min.) brings the story of Baby, a getaway driver for bank heists. As the movie opens, the First Bank of Atlanta is robbed, and Baby (while listening to the Jon Spencer Blues explosion) is able to escape from the seemingly endless streams of Atlanta Police cars. They all meet up with Doc, the ring leader who distributes the loot. 'One more job and I'm done' reminds Baby to Doc (we later learn why Baby 'owes' Doc). The next day, while grabbing a coffee, is served by a young lady for whom he takes an immediate liking. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from British writer-director Edgar Wright, who most recently gave us the brilliant 'The World's End'. Here he goes in a completely different direction, and instead delivers a highly stylish action movie, paired to a non-stop soundtrack of delightful songs from mostly back in the day. The reality is that the plot, as wafer-thin as it is, really is irrelevant and we move from scene to scene and simply enjoy what is plying out on the big screen. Ansel Elgort (from the 'divergent' trilogy) plays Baby. Kevin Spacey is in good form as the ringleader Doc. Lily James, as the coffee waitress Debora) continues her upward march (I just saw her last weekend in another movie, 'The Exception'). Flea (from the RHCP) seems to have the time of his life playing Eddie 'No Nose', one of the robbers. But keep an eye out for Sky Ferreira (yes, the indie music singer) in her role as Baby's mom when he was a little boy. The production, including the car chases and stunts, is top-notch all around. If you like an action movie AND love good music, you could do a lot worse than 'Baby Driver'.'Baby Driver' opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early Saturday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was absolutely PACKED. The buzz around 'Baby Driver' has been building steadily in recent weeks.'Best movie of the year!' some are saying. I wouldn't go that far. I enjoyed it for what it was, nothing less, nothing more. If you love action movie and good music, then 'Baby Driver' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",8,15,28,1 July 2017
Bridge of Spies," Spielberg playing it safe and 'Bridge of Spies' feels strangely subdued
","'Bridge of Spies' (2015 release; 141 min.) brings the story of how insurance lawyer Jim Donovan became involved in negotiating a prisoner exchange in Berlin between the US and the USSR. As the movie opens, we are told that it is '1957, the height of the cold war'. We then follow someone in Brooklyn, who after a long chase sequence gets arrested for spying for the Russians. In order to make it look like the spy is getting due process and a 'fair shake', the US government appoints a lawyer to represent him. Turns out to be NY insurance lawyer (and ex-Nurnberg assistant prosecutor) Jim Donovan. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest in series of historical 'inspired by true events' movies from director Steven Spielberg, this time directing from a script by Matt Charman, Ethan Coen and Joel Coen (yes, THE Coen brothers). I had seen the trailer a number of times, and was expecting a riveting movie in line with earlier historical movies from Spielberg such as Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, and Munich. Alas, it was not to be. The movie lacks any tension whatsoever, and has the feeling of having been done strictly 'by the numbers'. The best scenes are when we get to Berlin, in the frantic days as the wall was being completed and people were desperate to get out of East Berlin. And the of course the climax of the movie, filmed on the real bridge of spies (the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin, near Potsdam--I had the good fortune of visiting this site a few years ago, it gave me the chills walking on it). There are several noteworthy acting performances: Tom Hanks (in his 4th cooperation with Spielberg) as Jim Donovan, and Mark Rylance as the spy Rudolf Abel (great line: Donovan: 'you're not worried?', to which Abel responds: 'would it help?', ha!). As always with Spielberg, the production is terrific and authentic in to the smallest of details. Last but certainly not least: the orchestral score is, shockingly, NOT by John Williams, which I believe marks the first time in 40 years in a Steven Spielberg (the score is from Thomas Newman, who does a fine job). Bottom lime: I found 'Bridge of Spies' strangely subdued and to me it feels like Spielberg played it safe in this one.'Bridge of Spies' opened nationwide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay, but frankly I had expected a lot more people, given this is the movie's opening weekend. I have seen most of Spielberg's movies and as a long-time fan, must admit this to me feels like one of the weaker movies he's done in a long time. Is it bad? Of course not, but neither is it great. Nevertheless, this is of course a personal and subjective view, and I would encourage you to check out 'Bridge of Spies', be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",7,3,8,17 October 2015
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," 'There is only one Spider-Man, and I'm it'... Stupendously great fun
","'Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse' (2018 release; 117 min.) is the latest version of the Peter Parker /Spiderman story. After a clever opening montage with the Columbia/Sony/Marvel logos, Spiderman introduces himself to the audience: 'There is only one Spiderman, and I'm it!'. We then get to know Miles Morales, a teenager who admires Spiderman, and does not like attending school at the elite Brooklyn Visions Academy. His dad is a cop at the NYPD, and does not care much for Spiderman. One day Miles visits his freewheeling uncle, and while Miles is working on mural art, he is bitten by a spider. He wakes up the next day having grown taller overnight, and with a lower voice, and with strange powers. Could there be more than one Spiderman? At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: when a movie requires not one, not two, but three directors, it typically is a very bad sign, but in this case it turns out to be the exact opposite. Among the never-ending stream of comic book heroes live action fare, often with dubious quality (this week's Aquaman looks particularly bad), here comes a computer-animated film that has been freed from live-action shackles, and as a result is the freshest offering in the comic book superhero movies in a long time. The animation is dazzling, the characters are in-depth, the story line is complex and engaging. When I saw the movie's end credits, I saw all these big names for the voices (Nicolas Cage, Hailee Steinfeld, Lily Tomlin, Zoe Kravitz, Liev Schreiber, etc.). Truth be told, I hadn't recognized a single of them as the movie was playing. Look out for a cameo appearance from Stan Lee himself (sadly he passed away just weeks before this movie came out). Bottom line: 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider=Verse' shows the way how, for me, comic books should get the big screen treatment. Can't wait for the sequel and apparent spin-offs (yes, plural!).'Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse' was released wide on December 14, with tremendous positive buzz and critical acclaim. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely, with lots of families and kids 'from age 7 to 77'. If you are curious whether the film is as good as people say it is, I readily suggest you check it out, be it in theaters (for maximum visual impact), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",9,6,11,24 December 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Everything that an 'ol' school' action movie should be
","'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' (2015 release; 131 min.) is the fifth movie in the MI franchise, starring once again Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. As the movie opens, we are in Minsk, Belarus, where a large military cargo plane is about to take off with a payload of bombs. The plane must be stopped at all cost. When seemingly the plane is about to leave, pout of nowhere comes Hunt, who jumps onto the plane and holds on for dear life. He succeeds. All this is even before the opening credits roll! The eventual story is about stopping the Syndicate, a rogue league of terrorists who will stop at nothing, and the parallel struggle of the Impossible Missions Force ('IMF') to retain independence from the CIA. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this latest installment of the Mission Impossible franchise is written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, no stranger to Tom Cruise (they made 'Jack Reacher' together a couple of years ago). Second, this movie truly represents the 'ol' school' of action flicks at its very best (the only other franchise still to equally do so is of course the Bond franchise). From the get-go, we are thrown into the action, which basically is non-stop and relentless, rendering the specific plot points almost meaningless, other than there being the 'good' guys and the 'bad' guys. Third, I love the international scenery of the movie: London, Paris, Vienna, Havana, Casablanca, etc., they are all featured prominently, and then some. The 15 min. sequence at the Vienna Opera (while Puccini's Tarandot is playing) is nothing short of brilliant, even Hitchcock-esque in its approach and build-up. Last but not least, there are some great performances in the movie, in particular Sean Harris as baddie Solomon Lane, but even more so fairly newcomer Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa, another undercover spy who may or may not be 'bad'. Surely we will see much more of her after this role. But in the end, this is Cruise's movie all the way. Now approaching his mid-fifties, Cruise looks about 10-15 years younger, and almost freakishly so. That said, no-one dominates the action genre like Cruise does. Seeing Cruise hanging on the side of the plane is just one (but probably the best) of the many 'can you believe this?' moments in the movie.'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' opened this weekend. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was PACKED and the audience absolutely ate it up, giving a spontaneous applause when the end titles started rolling. Based on the excellent word-of-mouth, I can see this movie having some serious legs at the box office. If you love action movies, you cannot do better than this. 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,1,3,2 August 2015
Dunkirk," Best movie of the year (so far), hands down
","'Dunkirk' (2017 release; 106 min.) brings the real story of the WWI evacuation from Dunkirk. As the movie opens, we are informed that the English and French troops are 'trapped at Dunkirk, awaiting their fate'. We then are introduced to three separate story lines: 1. The Mole (one week(, 2. The Sea (one day) and 3. The Air (one hour). We get to know Tommy, a British solder who is desperately trying to find a way off the beach, back home. Meanwhile, Mr. Dawson and 2 younger boys are readying their small Moontime boat to cross the English Channel towards Dunkirk. And in the third story line, we see three Spitfires watching in the skies for sign of any German planes. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-producer-director Christopher Nolan. He can do almost no wrong in my book, and his movies are EVENTS. Here he brings perhaps the finest movie of his career, bringing an ol' fashioned WWII true story (it's pretty amazing to think that since WWII ended over 7 decades ago, the Dunkirk evacuation has never been made into a movie--not counting the many documentaries of course). There is relatively little dialogue in the movie, so all the drama and tension comes from simply observing what plays out. And how dramatic it is! This is one of those movies that simply BEGS to be seen on the big screen. I must admit that the air battle scenes were simply out of this work. I cannot recall seeing a more thrilling account of WWII air battles since 'The Battle of Britain'. The reported production budget for this was $150 mill, and you can see why. Even better, we (or at least I) feel emotionally invested every single minute of this movie. This is mostly a no-name cast, with works great for this type of movie. Kenneth Branagh has a fairly small role as the pier master, and Tom Hardy is one of the Spitfire pilots. Bottom line: this is for me, hands down, the best film of 2017 so far.'Dunkirk' opened wide this weekend, and I literally couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was PACKED to the rafters, I am happy to report. The couple next to me seemed as into the movie as I was (I saw the woman hide her eyes with her hands on several occasions). Given the stellar critical acclaim this has been getting, and the strong word-of-mouth that surely will follow, I can see his movie having long legs at the box office, and deservedly so. 'Dunkirk' is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",9,3,10,21 July 2017
Jackie," 'I didn't want fame. I just became a Kennedy'
","'Jackie' (2016 release; 100 min.) is a movie about Jackie Kennedy. As the movie opens, we are told this is 'Hyannus Port, MA, 1963', and in fact it's one week after JFK's assassination. Jackie is hosting a report of Life Magazine to talk about her life as the First Lady and what things may be in store for her going forward. From there the movie looks in a non-linear line at various events, not just surrounding the assassination and the subsequent funeral, but also at Jackie's time in the White House (such as when she hosted a TV special in 1961).Couple of comments: this movie is the latest from Chilean director Pablo Larraín, previously best known for the Oscar-nominated movie 'No' a few years ago. Here he tackles the delicate task as a non-America to being us a look at an American icon, and I do mean Jackie Kennedy. As she plans for the elaborate procession and funeral, who is she really doing it for: Jack's legacy? the public at large? herself? When pressed by the reporter, Jackie simply answers 'I didn't want fame. I just became a Kennedy', wow. The movie is shouldered by the brilliant performance of Natalie Portman, who is in virtually every scene. I found myself pretty much mesmerized by this film, and the outstanding soundtrack, courtesy of UK composer Mika Levi (a/k/a/ Mikachu), only contributed to that feeling. Greta Gerwig is barely recognizable as Jackie's aide Nancy. Peter Sarsgaard plays Bobby Kennedy very effectively. Also kudos to John Hurt as Jackie's priest. The movie's script comes from Noah Oppenheim ('Maze Runner'), and it seems to me he captured the essence of Jackie's delicate personality in the days following the assassination. Portman is already whispered as being the front runner for the Best Actress Oscar, and it certainly wouldn't be stolen if she wins for this.Jackie has been slowly but steadily getting a wider release, It is now playing on 3 screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at on Christmas Day was attended nicely but frankly I had expected a sell-out or something close to it, which it surely wasn't. I've seen quite a few JFK assassination-related movies over the years (including 2013's 'Parkland'), and I can honestly say that 'Jackie' is truly a new experience of what happened in those days. If you have a chance to catch 'Jackie', be it in the theater, or on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, do not miss it. 'Jackie' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,0,3,25 December 2016
Toy Story 4," Celebrating a quarter century of fun and sheer brilliance
","'Toy Story 4' (2019 release; 100 min.) brings the on-going adventures of Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the gang. As the movie opens, Andy has passed along his toys to a young girl, Bonnie. Bonnie regularly passes over Woody when choosing what toys to play with. But when Bonnie is denied taking a toy with her by her dad for her kindergarten orientation day, Woody makes a bold move and sneaks into her backpack. At school, Bonnie is alone but with the 'help' from Woody, she makes a new toy, a spork whom she names Forky and she absolutely adores... At this point we're 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out,Couple of comments: it blows the mind that it's been 24 years since the original 'Toy Story' was released. Now a quarter-century later (and exactly 20 years since 'Toy Story 2'), the gang is at it again. The movie is so well done on so many levels, first and foremost at the actual story-telling level. The film's pace is fast much of the time: only so many minutes, with so much to tell. Second, all of these characters are now so familiar to us, it's like going to a long-delayed family reunion. Then there is the supreme voice cast with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen being top notch once again. But the big surprise for me in 'Toy Story 4' is how much of it is really intended for audiences that are not kids. One good example is the entire side thread involving the 'defective' girl toy Gabby Gabby (sorry, I shan't say more). I was 35 when the original 'Toy Story' came out, and my kids were 9 and 6, so you can do the math, yet we all still love this franchise. Here's hoping that we can do this again in another decade. But don't make it much longer than that. I'm not getting any younger!'Toy Story 4' is now in its 4th weekend in the theaters. I purposefully waited that long so as to avoid some over the big crowds. This Sunday's early evening screening here in Cincinnati was attended perfectly from that perspective (about 25 in total, mostly extended families with young kids). Interestingly, I don't think any of these young kids were older than 6 or 7. In other words: none of them were even born when 'Toy Story 3' came out (in 2010). It is no coincidence that 'Toy Story' is the highest rated franchise ever in Rotten Tomatoes' history, and of course is Certified Fresh. 'Toy Story 4' is a WINNER all the way.",9,1,6,15 July 2019
Climax," Truly 'way out there' experimental film
","'Climax' (2018 release from France; 96 min.) brings the story of a dance troupe. As the movie opens, a choreographer is interviewing each of them to get more personal background information. We then switch to a rehearsal, where we see the dancers perform as classic dance tunes of Cerrone and Patrick Hernandez are thundering. As the rehearsal concludes, the dancers start talking to one another, while most of them drink lots of sangria. The stories become gossipy rather quickly... At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from noted experimental French director/editor Gaspar Noe. Here he brings to the big screen a story inspired by true events that took place in France in 1996, as we are reminded by the movie's opening credits. When I see the term 'inspired', I translate that as 'very loosely based on, with lots of artistic licensing, just because'. The movie is really two films in one: the rehearsal and its immediate aftermath, and then the transition into personal hell for these dancers. The film was made on a very small budget and with little to no prior dancing experience by the cast. Oh, and did I mention that the movie's opening dance rehearsal and subsequent conversation comes in one long shot of about 15 min.? And that there are subsequent single shots that run even longer? Yea, it's kinda like that. The contrast between the movie's opening scenes and the last 15 min. or so couldn't be further apart mood-wise (and screaming-wise). There is a ferocity in these acting performances that are bound to unsettle some (they sure did unsettle me). Bottom line: this is a movie that is truly 'way out there', but not without its merits (I don't really want to use the word 'charming' as that is really the exact opposite of what this movie is). Last but not least, there is a ton of great dance music featured throughout the movie (Cerrone, Patrick Hernandez, Giorgio Moroder, Soft Cell, and on and on).'Climax' premiered at last year's Cannes film festival and finally opened in US theaters this month. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati, was attended dismally (5 people, including myself), and I'd be surprised if this plays more than one week. If you are in the mood for a weird cocktail of dance and talk and all hell breaks loose, all with a French twist, then by all means I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater (not very likely at this point), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6,1,2,18 March 2019
The Favourite," 'The Favourite' vs. 'Mary Queen of Scots': and the winner is...
","'The Favourite' (2018 release; 119 min.) brings the story of Queen Anne. As the movie opens, we see her, in frail condition, while her closest confidante, Sarah, seems to be directing most of Britain's business. Then arrives Abigail, Sarah's cousin, desperately looking for a job. She gets a low-level job but it isn;t long before she manages to findthe Queen's interest (treating her legs' burns), and before we known it, Sarah and Abigail are in a fight for the Queen's graces... To tell you more of the movie's plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just haven to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Yorgos Lanthimos, who previously brought us 'off center' movies like 'The Lobster' and just last year's 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer'. This movie is very much in the same vein, another 'off center', this time, historical piece, based on more-or-less true events taking place in the early 1700s. Frankly, it took me a while to get into the movie, as the first half establishes the overall sense (Abigail the newcomer vs. Sarah the power-person), and it wasn't really clear whether this was comedy or drama, but the movie's second half resolves that dilemma: this is drama, and court intrigue at the highest level. The movie's greatest asset is the lead performances of the three ladies: Olivia Colman (as Queen Anne), Rachael Weisz (as Sarah) and Emily Stone (as Abigail). I don't think I can point out which is the better, all three of them are just outstanding. But make no mistake: this is not just another historical drama, as director Lanthimos puts his very much 'off center' stamp on it and it makes not for your 'standard' viewing. The movie has been getting rave critical acclaim, and while I think this is a good movie for sure, I am just a little bit puzzled, frankly. On the other hand, when you compare this to that other recent historical drama (set 150 years earlier), 'Mary Queen of Scots', then 'The Favourite' is the better movie of the two.'The Favourite' opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early Christmas Eve evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay (about 20 people or so). If you are interested in historical dramas with an 'off-center' bent, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it at the theater, on VOD, or on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7,4,9,26 December 2018

As the movie opens, in the pre-opening  credits scene we see a teenage girl running out of a house, in obvious  terror of something that seems to be following her. She drives off in a  panic and later we see her mutilated body. After the opening credits,  we get to know Jay, another teenage girl, and her group of friends.  Eventually Jay and her boyfriend have sex in his car, and that is when  stranger things start to happen. To tell you more would spoil your  viewing experience , you'll just have to see for yourself how it all  plays out.  Couple of comments: this is the second full-length feature from  writer-director David Robert Mitchell, and this time he gives us a  scary movie worthy of that name. This is MILES away from so-called  scary (but in reality violence-porn) movies like the Saw franchise.  Instead this movie is reminiscent of the ol' style John Carpenter  movies. In fact, it is no accident that 'It Follows' has a strong  1970s-1980s vibe (lots of old cars from that era, no cell phone, no  internet, no cable TV, etc.). The movie is set in and around Detroit,  and the city feels like it is playing a character itself in the movie.  Check out the scene where the group of 5 kids is driving through one of  the more harrowing parts of Detroit, seemingly a post-apocalyptic area,  and later the Detroit Swimming building. Kudos to Maika Monroe in the  leading role of Jay. I saw her most recently in 'Labor Day' but here  she brings an outstanding starring performance as vulnerable Jay. I  couldn't help but be reminded of a young Cloe Sevigny. Last but  certainly not least, there is an outstanding electronic soundtrack,  composed by Disasterpeace (the stage moniker of Rich Vreeland), which  is equally worth seeking out.  After months of internet buzz and other hype, the movie finally opened  nationwide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it, even though as  such I am not a big fan of 'scary' movies. The early evening screening  where I saw this at was attended okay but not great, which surprised me  (I had expected a lot more people in the theater). It doesn't matter.  'It Follows' lives up to the hype, and then some. One of the better  scary movies I have seen in a long, long time. If you have a chance to  see 'It Follows', be it in the theater, or eventually on Amazon Instant  Video or DVD/Blu-ray, do not miss it. 'It Follows' is HIGHLY  RECOMMENDED",8,113,221,29 March 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," For the love of film, and of Hollywood's waning golden era
","'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' (2019 release; 161 min.) brings the story of struggling actor Rick Dalton and his stunt double Cliff Booth. As the movie opens, we get a clip from NBC's 'Bounty Law' TV series, and Rick and Cliff are interviewed (all in B&W). We then switch to 'Saturday, February 8, 1969', and Rick is worried about his career, wondering what to do as a next move. Meanwhile, Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate land at LAX, creating a media frenzy as they walk to the airport. They drive home and as it turns out, they are next door neighbors with Rick Dalton... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest opus from Quentin Tarantino, and only the 2nd film crediting him as writer-producer-director (after 2007's 'Grindhouse'). Here Tarantino recreates and re-imagines Hollywood's waning days of its so-called golden era (culminating in real life with the murders of Sharon Tate and others by the Charles Manson crazies). By mixing real-life and fictional characters, Tarantino creates a parallel universe, where he is of course in complete control. When I say 'recreate', it is really that. No amount of detail is too small, check out the street scenes as Rick and Cliff are driving around. Pay close attention to what all is in the background, and you'll see what I mean. The film is helped immensely by the utter brilliant lead performances from be Leonardo DiCaprio (as Rick) and Brad Pitt (as Cliff). In particular DiCaprio (playing multiple characters in movies and TV shows) gets to stretch in a way that demonstrates, once again, why he is among the very best actors in Hollywood. Per the usual from Tarantino, the soundtrack is chock-full of great music from that era. While I recognized quite a few tunes, I was also pleasantly surprised with the more obscure songs. Bottom line: I really, really enjoyed this film. The proof is in the pudding: I was absolutely astonished when the house lights came back on. Had 2 hrs. and 40 min. passed by just like that? Apparently they had!'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' premiered at this year's Cannes film festival, to immediate critical acclaim. The movie opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati (in a medium-sized theater) was sold out down to the very last scene. First signs are that the movie have performed much better at the box office than projected (now expecting to deliver $40+ million). If you are a fan of Tarantino or simply love a well-crafted look at Hollywood's waning golden era, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",9,38,67,28 July 2019
Get Out," Clever and original 'horror' movie for the thinking person
","The opening scene of 'Get Out' (2017 release; 103 min.) shows a black guy being abducted and thrown into the back of a car as he was talking at night in an unspecified suburb. We have no clue what is going on. After the opening title, we get to know Rose and Chris, an interracial couple . They are getting ready for a weekend visit to Rose's parents, who have no idea that Chris is African-American, but Rose insists all will be fine. On the drive up, when their car is hit by a deer, the cop asks Chris for identification, even though he wasn't driving. Rose takes offense at the seeming racial profiling. Finally Rose and Chris arrive at her parent's place, a suburban McMansion, and receive a warm welcome. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is a labor of love from actor-writer-producer-director Jordan Peele, making his directorial debut. Peele, best known for comedy, goes into a vastly different direction, presenting a clever and original 'horror' story for the thinking person. If you are expecting a 'slasher' horror movie, the likes of which are all too common these days in the horror genre, you will be disappointed (or relieved, depending on your viewpoint). Instead, the story focuses on an increasingly discomforting situation where a black man gets introduced to a white family (and circle of friends), who 'would've voted for Obama a third time, if I had the chance'. British actor Daniel Kaluuya, whom we most recently saw in the outstanding 'Sicario', is even better in this lead role, playing the cool-as-cucumber Chris, until things aren't cool anymore (mustn't say more--biting my tongue here!). But the big star, even though he never appears on the screen, is of course Jordan Peele, who shows enormous promise in his directorial debut. Working on a (for Hollywood) microscopic budget of a mere $4.5 million, Peele gives us an accomplished 'horror' movie where less is more. Can't wait to see what Peele will do next, but whatever it is, I'm all in! 'Get Out' opened wide some weeks ago to immediate critical and commercial acclaim. This movie may well become the biggest financial success (as in: return on investment) of the year (rapidly approaching $150 mill. at the box office in North America). The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati this weekend was PACKED and sold out to the very last seat, quite unusual for a movie that's been playing already for weeks. But the positive buzz and correlating word-of-mouth surrounding this movie are absolutely merited. Even if you're not a fan of the horror film genre (like me), I encourage you to seek this out, be it in the theater, later on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. 'Get Out' is, in every which way, a WINNER.",9,9,18,20 March 2017
Room," 'Good morning rug! good morning TV! good morning sink!'
","'Room' (2015 release; 117 min.) brings the story of a young lady named Joy, and her son Jack. As the movie opens, Jack wakes up and can't wait to tell Ma that it's his 5th birthday. He goes around the room, exclaiming with joy 'good morning rag, good morning TV, good morning sink!'. It becomes clear very quickly that, despite Jack's innocence and joy, they are actually held captive and Jack has never known anything other than 'Room', as they call this place. Joy is trying to figure out a way to deceive the man who is holding them captive, so as to escape. TO tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is directed by Lenny Abrahamson, who just last year brought us the delightfully quirky 'Frank', and Emma Donoghue, who wrote the book on which this is based, wrote the script. I have not read the book, so I do not know how closely the movie sticks to the book (I'm guessing quite closely, though). Second, as the movie's trailer makes plain, Joy and Jack do end up getting out of 'Room', and as a result this movie really consists of two separate parts: before and after, and each takes about half of the movie's running time. The 'before' part is nothing short of extraordinary, as we observe Joy and Jack living in their cramped quarters (which look quite big to Jack). Third, everyone's been talking about the Best Actress Oscar chances for Brie Larson in her role of Joy/Ma, so imagine my surprise when it turns out that yes, she is quite good, but the young boy playing Jack simply steals the movie, period. Jacob Tremblay brings one of the more astonishing and accomplished performances of such a young actor or actress in recent memory. Joan Allen (as Joy's mom) is quite powerful too, but also keep an eye out for William H. Macy's short (less than 19 min.) but impactful role as Joy's dad.'Room' opened this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I finally had an opportunity to see it. The week night screening where I saw this at was attended surprisingly well for a week night, which is great news. I imagine that 'Room' will pick up quite a few nominations in the upcoming awards season, and deservedly so. 'Room' is an outstanding movie on so many levels, and I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. 'Room' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",9,1,10,17 November 2015
A Quiet Place," 'Stay silent, stay alive!'
","'A Quiet Place' (2018 release; 90 min.) brings the story of the Abbott family. As the movie opens, we are told it's 'Day 89', and the Abbotts (mom, dad, and 3 kids) are quietly looking for useful things in an abandoned store in an abandoned village. They communicate through sign language. When the youngest, a small boy maybe 4-5, wants to take a toy, dad says no, because it might make too much noise (which apparently sets in motion unspeakable things). But behind dad's back, his older sister gives him the toy anyway. On their way home through the woods, the little boy starts playing with the toy, to the horror of mom and dad, but before dad can do anything, the little boy is snatched up by a large alien creature. At this point we are 5 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second movie directed by actor John Krasinski, and what an outstanding effort this is. Krasinksi himself plays the role of dad, and Emily Blunt (Krasinski's wife in the real world) is mom. we find out in the movie that the story is set in 2020, but we are never told what exactly happened to the world as we know it, or how these creatures got here. All we need to know is: they are here and if you make a sound, you'll probably get hunted down. But for a few sentences spoken midway in the movie, there is no spoken dialogue whatsoever. This makes for a very interesting movie experience. Sure, we've seen dialogue-free movies in recent years (All Is Lost, and The Red Turtle come to mind), but this is in a horror movie setting. It took the theater audience a while to settle down (way too much crowd noise in the beginning for my liking), but about midway through, you could hear a pin drop in the theater. Why? The movie makers were clever enough to develop these characters in a way that you end up caring about them and feeling emotionally invested in the movie. You are rooting for the Abbotts to make it through! Because there is no dialogue, the orchestral score by composer Marco Beltrami plays a disproportionate role in the movie (almost like a character itself), and I will seek that out as well. 'A Quite Place' premiered last month at the SXSW Festival, to immediate critical acclaim. The buzz around the movie has been building ever since. It opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was pretty much a sell-out. As mentioned before, the crowd really got into it, and in particular as to being quiet along with the quiet moments in the movie (of which there are a number). Bottom line: 'A Quiet Place' is the latest original/clever horror film, and I encourage you to see it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. 'A Quiet Place' is a WINNER.",8,3,7,7 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Great but not perfect (and raises questions)
","'Call Me By Your Name' (2017 release from Italy; 132 min.) brings the story of Elio and Oliver. As the movie opens, we are reminded that it is 'Summer of 1983' and 'Somewhere in northern Italy'. We get to know 17 yr. old Elio and his parents, spending time at their summer home in Crema, Italy. Then Oliver, who is a research assistant to Elio's dad (a professor of archaeology) arrives to spend 6 weeks there. Elio shows Oliver around in the local town. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Italian director Luca Guadagnino, who just a few years ago brought us the excellent 'A Bigger Splash' (and you can immediately pick up on certain structural similarities between these two films). Here, Guadagnino examines the restless and at times confused state of Elio who, for reasons never made clear, comes around to liking Oliver, a lot. Frankly, I struggled with that. Another thing: am I the only one who raises a question as to the age difference between Elio (whom we know is 17) and Oliver (his age is not disclosed, but I'm guessing, being a research assistant, probably mid-20s, if not older), a significant gap from a 17 yr. old's perspective. But there are plenty of other great things about this movie. First and foremost, having grown up in Belgium (with significant vacation time in the south of France), the movie captures the endless summers of my youth perfectly (I moved to the States in... 1983, the year this movie is set). The bike rides, the meals outside, the laying around in the grass, etc. etc., that is what summer time was like in the late 70s/early 80s. Second, Timothée Chalamet (as Elio) is nothing short of spectacular (on the heels of his smaller role in Lady Bird). While his name sounds French, he is in fact an American, but perfectly bilingual. Third, the production set and photography is pure eye-candy. Last and certainly not least, there is a fabulous soundtrack, with several new songs from Sufjan Stevens that capture the movie's mood just right. No surprise then that when the Oscar nominations were announced today, 'Call My By Your Name' got 4 of them (Best Movie, Best Actor, Best Adopted Screenplay and Best original Song).The movie finally went wide this past weekend, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. Bottom line is that there are a number of great things about this movie, but I cannot give it a 'perfect' 5 star rating for the reasons I mentioned. That should not stop you from checking out 'Call Me By Your Name', be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7,0,3,23 January 2018
Pawn Sacrifice," Selective look at the life and times of Bobby Fischer: 'Bobby has problems.... So did Mozart'
","'Pawn Sacrifice' (2015 release; 115 min.) is a fictional bio-pick about chess legend Bobby Fischer. As the movie opens, we get archive TV news footage from a bunch of different countries with the shocking news that Bobby Fischer did not show up for Game 2 of the Chess World Championship, as we see Fischer holed up in his room, refusing to come out. We then go back to '15 November '51, Brooklyn, NY', where we meet 8 yr. old Bobby, growing up with his mom. We already see his mind getting restless quickly, but also starting to astonish with his chess moves. At this point we're maybe 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: when I herd earlier this year that a movie was being made about the life and times of Bobby Fischer, and that it was directed by none other than Edward Zwick (the director of 'Glory' and 'Defiance', among others), I was pretty excited about it. Alas, it was not to be. What I thought would be a bio-pick on Fischer's life, turns out to be a very selective look instead. The movie's focus is clearly, and almost to the exclusion of everything else, on the 1972 World Championship against Boris Spassky. Yes, we do get a few glimpses of the younger Fischer. Fischer's mental problems do not get examined in-depth but are dealt with hastily. 'Bob has problems' comments Father Lombarty, to which someone responds 'So did Mozart', and end of story. Most disappointing for me was that the film essentially stops with Fischer's win in 1972. The remaining 36 years of his life, which remain clouded in mystery for a good part, are dismissed in about 2 minutes at the end of the movie. The leading acting performances, with Tobey Maguire as Bobby Fischer and Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky, are quite good, but keep your eye out as well for up-and-coming Canadian actress Évelyne Brochu in the role of Donna, Fischer's very first girlfriend (when he already was in his 20s). If you are interested in a more in-depth look at the life and times of Bobby Fischer, I'd readily recommend the excellent 2011 documentary 'Bobby Fischer Against The World'.'Pawn Sacrifice' opened this weekend on five screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. I was eager to see it. The matinée screening where I saw this at today turned out to be a private screening, as in: I literally was the only person in the theater. I can't imagine that this movie will stick around for more than a couple of weeks in the theater. I encourage you to check out 'Pawn Sacrifice' for yourself, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",4,16,31,26 September 2015
Hidden Figures," Where 'The Right Stuff' meets racial segregation
","'Hidden Figures' (2016 release; 127 min.) brings the story, 'based on true events' we are reminded at the beginning, of three African- American women working at NASA. As the movie opens, we are in 'West Virginia, 1926', where we see a young girl amaze everyone with her math skills, and she is soon offered a scholarship to attend classes for the gifted. We then move to 'Hampton, Virginia, 1961', where we get to know the three ladies. They are having car trouble, and when a police officer drives by and checks what the problem is, he can hardly believe they all work at NASA (but does give them an escort). At NASA, the ladies are working at the 'Colored Computers' section, but then one day, Katherine is asked to join the 'Space Task Group', as the space race with the USSR is in full swing. At this point we're 15 min. or so into the movie but to tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second movie from writer-director Theodore Melfi (after the Bill Murray vehicle 'St Vincent' a few years ago). Here he brings the larger than life (yet true) story of how these three ladies ended up playing an important, if not critical role, in the space race, in particular getting John Glenn into orbit, yet at the same time suffering from the racial segregation that was into place still in those days. The 'running joke' in the movie is that Katherine disappears time and again to run to the 'Colored Ladies Room' which is 1/2 mile away from the Space Task Group. When one day confronted about her long absences by the agency's head, she boils over in emotion and anger and humiliation when she explains why (truly a chilling moment in the movie). Not long thereafter, the agency's head does away with the segregated bathrooms, claiming 'Here at NASA, we're all the same color!' (the theater's audience erupted with a huge applause at that time, amazing). The movie truly is a mix of 'The Right Stuff' and the horrible racial segregation and discrimination that was the accepted norm then. (Interestingly, 'Hidden Figures' is set in officially segregated Virginia, just like that other recent and equally important movie 'Loving' about an interracial couple's fight to get their marriage recognized in the late 50s/early 60s.) 'Hidden Figures' is helped enormously by the heartwarming performances of the three lead actresses: Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae (recently also in the equally excellent 'Moonlight'), but most of all Taraji Henson as Katherine. Kevin Costner as the agency's head is okay too. Kirstin Dunst is barely recognizable as Vivian, another NASA employee. There are tons of great songs in the movie, both oldies from that era but also new tunes (sounding like oldies) penned by Pharell Williams (the score is courtesy of veteran Hans Zimmer). My only 'complaint', minor as it is, is that the movie's running time is a bit too long for its own good, and could've easily be edited/trimmed by 15-20 min.'Hidden Figures' expanded wide this past weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED to the rafters, literally sold out to the very last seat. The audience laughed and cried, and when the end credits started rolling, gave it a thunderous applause. It blows the mind that the story of these 'Hidden Figures' has never been brought to the big screen until now, but better late than never I suppose. In any event, 'Hidden Figures' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,9,27,9 January 2017
1917," Best movie of 2019... They Shall Not Grow Old-meets-Dunkirk
","As '1917' (2019 release; 119 min.) opens, we are told it is 'April 6, 1917', and Lance Corporals Schofield and Blake from the British army are summoned by the General: the two soldiers must deliver an urgent message to 2 battalions who are about to fall into a massive German trap. Blake's brother is among the 1600 soldiers in peril. Off they go, Schofield and Blake. At this point we are less than 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out...Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from British director-writer-producer Sam Mendes, who brought us the 2 most recent James Bond films, and American Beauty way before that. Here he brings a WWI story to the big screen as it was relayed to him by his grandfather, who served in WWI. I don't want to spoil anything by revealing more of the plot. Instead let me make the following general observations: as the movie opens, we watch as Schofield and Blake walk to the General's camp, get his orders, and get underway, and after a couple of minutes, I realized that all if this was being shown in one continuous take. Then it became 5 min., then 10, then 15 min., and I thought to myself, how much longer can this be just one continuous take? (Sorry, I'm going to to tell you.) The movie is just epic on so many levels. There are some stretches where there is little to no dialogue and it is then how critically important the movie's sound design is. You may recall that in 2018 there was a fabulous documentary called 'They Shall Not Grow Old' (directed by Peter Jackson), in which WWI archive footage is restored gloriously. And in 2017 there was Christopher Nolan's epic WWII drama 'Dunkirk'. To me '1917' recalls both those films in the best possible way. Kudos also to Thomas Newman for the massive original score, which plays almost non-stop during the movie.'1917' went wide this weekend, and i couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati in a mid-size theater was pretty much sold out, I am very happy to say. Winning Best Picture and Best Director at last weekend's Golden Globes will only reinforce the strong word-of-mouth this movie surely will generate. I am going on record that this movie will get multiple Oscar nominations (and then win them). If you like an epic war movie, you are in for a treat, and I would readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",10,1,6,11 January 2020
Sing Street," 'Futurist Band Forming'
","'Sing Street' (2016 release from Ireland; 105 min.) brings the story of Conor, a 15 yr. old boy. As the movie opens, we are reminded that this is 'Dublin 1985', and we see Conor strumming the guitar in his bedroom. At dinner time, Conor's parents inform him and his older brother and younger sister that Conor is being transferred to a Catholic school to save money. Conor has a hard time adjusting to the new school environment and is picked on by another boy. Then one day, Conor notices a girl across the street. He gathers all his courage and asks her to be in a video for his band. When she says 'okay', Conor realizes that he needs to out together a band, on the double! At this point we're not eve 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest music-related film from writer-producer-director John Carney (Once; Begin Again). In fact, one can make the argument that 'Sing Street' is the spiritual prequel to Once, as 'Sing Street' looks at the life of 15 and 16 yr olds as they are starting to make decisions for themselves and trying to make something of their lives. And what better motivation to start a band than to impress a girl! Carney nails the musical landscape of the mid-80s in Ireland perfectly. 'Thursday, 7 pm, It's Top of the Pops!' screams a voice on TV, and we witness Duran Duran's 'Rio' video. When Conor struggles to recruit like-minded kids for his band (called Sing Street), he posts fliers in various locations, 'Futurist Band Forming'. And how might such a futurist band sound? It sounds remarkably like Duran Duran-meets-Franz Ferdinand (check out first song 'The Riddle of the Model'). While much of the movie is light-hearted, Carney does not forget to shed light on some darker aspects of Irish society (mass-migration to England; stoner older brother is college drop-out, and of course the role of religion (Catholic, specifically) in society. But in the end, it's all about the music. Carney co-wrote and co-plays on all the new songs with Gary Clark, and Once star Glen Hansard is listed in the credits as one of the studio musicians. Last but certainly not least, props to the performances given by the two leads: Ferdia Walsh-Peelo as Conor, and Lucy Boynton as 16 yr. old Raphina. Ah, to be young and having your whole life ahead of you... Bottom line: this movie is sheer exuberance.'Sing Street' opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at was PACKED, I am happy to report (perhaps the lousy weather had something to do with it). I had a smile on my face for much of the movie. If you are looking for a feel-good movie that happens to showcase a lot of great music, you cannot go wrong with this. 'Sing Street' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",9,1,3,8 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," 'Leia sent me here with hope', but will Skywalker return the favor?
","'Star Wars - The Last Jedi' (2017 release; 152 min.) brings the continuing saga of the 'next generation' of Star Wars heroes. The movie opens with a bang, literally. The First Order reigns supreme, and the Resistance is scrambling to escape their base. That results in a dazzling 15 min. sequence where there are ever more detailed and complex battle scenes. And did I mention it is loud? Meanwhile, while all this is happening (and picking up directly where 'The Force Awakens' left off), Rey is trying to convince Luke Skywalker to rejoin the ranks of the Resistance. 'Leia sent me here with hope', she tells Skywalker. Will he? At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from rapidly rising writer-director Rian Johnson, who a few years ago brought us the excellent sci-fi thriller 'Looper'. While he alone is credited as being the writer, I imagine that Executive Producer JJ Abrams (who returns as director for Star Wars IX) had a lot of input as well in the overall story arch. As the years go by, and technology becomes yet more sophisticated, it is bewildering at time (in a good way) to take in all that we see on the big screen. Apparently this Star Wars movie is quite divisive among the Star Wars aficionados, and I really don't understand why. I was 17 when 'A New Hope' came out, and 20 when 'The Empire Strikes Back' was released. Now 4 decades later, much needed new life has been brought in this franchise, washing away the bad taste that Episodes I, II and III left us with now 20 years ago. The renewed Star Wars brings a nice mix of the new stuff along with some elements of the old stuff (Episodes IV, V and VI). In fact, I was struck by the parallels between this mpvoe and 'The Empire Strikes Back' on a number of occasions. The original score by John Williams once again plays an important role in the overall enjoyment. My main criticism of 'The Last Jedi' is that the movie is unnecessarily long at 2 hr. 32 min. Tighter editing could've cut a good 15-20 min. without missing any core aspects of the story. Last but certainly not least, it was with sadness that I watched Carrie Fischer in her last role ever. She was due to return for Episode IX. She will be missed by everyone in the Star Wars universe and fandom.I was not able to score tickets for the opening weekend, but did manage (just barely) to get tickets for last night (Tuesday evening). That screening here in Cincinnati was completely sold out. Even more remarkable for me was that a sizable portion of the audience were young kids, I'm talking 6-7-8 years old, and I didn't see any of them getting restless, despite the movie's long running time. Amazing. While of course you can watch this on Amazon Instant Video and eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, a movie like this just BEGS to be experienced on the big screen, along with other fans. 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is a WINNER.",7,1,5,20 December 2017
Cold War," Another gem from writer-director Pawel Pawiilowski
","'Cold War' 2018 release from Poland; original title 'Zimna wojna'; 90 min.) brings the story of Wiktor and Zula. As the movie opens, it is 'Poland, 1946', and Wictor and several others are driving around in rural Poland, taping various local (mostly folksy) songs. Then they go recruit rural singers to form an ensemble of singing and dancing. Among those auditioning is Zula, and she catches Wiktor's attention right away/ Meanwhile, the Communist Party sees a great opportunity to use the ensemble for political purposes... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: the last time we heard from writer-director Pawel Pawlikowski was when the stunning film 'Ida' was released some 3-4 years ago,, to universal acclaim (and winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Movie). It was one of my favorite films of that year. Now he returns with another post-WW II story, but that is where the parallel ends. Let me state upfront that 'Cold War' is plot-heavy, and hence I will not say another word what happens or doesn't happen. Instead let me heap praise on its two lead performers: Joanna Kullig (as Zula) and Tomacsa Kot (as Wiktor) are both outstanding. The movie, like 'Ida' is shot in striking B&W, and moreover shows in an almost (but not quite) 1:1 ratio. One caution: there is a LOT of singing and dancing in the movie (although the movie is NOT a musical), so if you don't care for music, you may want to consider something else. At the end of the movie, we see that Pawlikowski dedicates the film 'to my parents', and in fact the movie is loosely based on them.'Cold War' premiered at last year's Cannes festival, to (once again) immediate and universal acclaim (Pawlikowski won 'Best Director'). No big surprise then that when the Oscar nominations were announced recently, 'Cold War' picked up 3 nominations: Best Foreign Language Movie, Best Director, and Best Cinematography. I don't know that it will win, though, as it is up against 'Roma', an even better film (with 10 Oscar nominations). Regardless, 'Cold War' is another gem from writer-director Pawel Pawiilowski. :Cold War: opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended ok but not great (about 15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign film shot in beautiful B&W, do yourself a favor and check out 'Cold War', be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. 'Cold War' is a WINNER.",8,0,3,2 February 2019
Silence," 'I am so tempted to despair. The weight of your silence is terrible.'
","'Silence' (2016 release; 161 min.) brings the story of several Jesuit priests in Japan. As the movie opens, we get to know Father Ferreira in a flashback in what looks to be maybe his final days. We then move to the present day, 1640, where Fathers Rodrigues and Garupe, Portuguese priests in Macau, and pleading with their superior to let them go into Japan to look for the missing Father Ferreira, whom they last heard about in a letter written in 1633, already 7 years ago. Their superior agrees, despite the clear and present danger to venture out in Christianity-hostile Japan. When Rodrigues and Garupe get smuggled into Japan, much to their surprise they find there is a thriving underground Christian community. But it isn't long before the dangers start popping up... At this point, we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is Martin Scorsese's long awaited (over 2 decades) 'religious' film, about the trials and turbulations of Jesuit priests in 17th century Japan. While things are happening pretty quickly in the initial 20 min. of the movie, they are most definitely slowing down to a glacial speed in the middle 90 min. of the movie. So if you are expecting some sort of an epic historical action-drama, please adjust your expectations immediately (in particular as it relates to the 'action' parts), otherwise you are bound to be let down, if not outright disappointed. I think the movie's running time is in fact too long, and could've easily be trimmed by probably 15-20 without losing much of the narrative. That said, if you can hang in until we get to the last 45 min., you are bound for a wonderful payoff. I thought the last part of the film was nothing short of mesmerizing. The central theme of the movie (will Rodrigues renounce his faith to save himself, like Ferreira may have done?) plays out beautifully. 'I am so tempted to despair. The weight of your silence is terrible.', Rodrigues tells us in a voice over, and we hear his pain! Along the way, we are treated to a visual spectacle (has there been a movie containing more fogged landscapes that this one?). Andrew Garfield, MILES away from his erstwhile Spider-Man days and just after his equally acclaimed performance in 'Hacksaw Ridge', is outstanding as Rodrigues. Adam Driver disappears from the movie altogether after just an hour (but for one short scene afterwards). Neeson makes an appearance both at the movie's very beginning and again in the last 30 min. When the end credits start rolling, Scorsese dedicates the movie to those that advanced catholicism in Japan, and adds for good measure Ad maiorem Dei gloriam (the Jesuit slogan, meaning For the Greater Glory of God).'Silence' opened wide this past weekend, and under-performed at the box office. This does not surprise me, as it takes quite a commitment to sit through this overly long film. It it weren't for the movie's excellent last 45 min., I'd have rated less than what I am rating it now (4 stars. The early evening screening where I saw this at on MLK Day here in Cincinnati was not attended very well (about 10 people), and unless there is a a significant pick-up in Oscar nominations next week, I can't see this movie lasting much longer in theaters. That said, if you are a Scorsese fan, you will definitely want to check this out.",7,1,3,17 January 2017
Hotel Mumbai," Hard to stomach, even harder to forget
","'Hotel Mumbai' (2018 release from Australia; 125 min.) is a movie about the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. As the movie opens, we are reminded the film is 'Based on True Events' and we are informed it is 'November 26, 2008, Mumbia, India', as we see 10 guys in a Zodiac boat about to arrive in Mumbai. Meanwhile, we see a guy getting ready for work, as a staff member of the famous Taj Hotel. Arriving at the Taj is a celebrity couple and their young son and the nanny. They are treated like royalty. Meanwhile the gang of 10 is disbursing to various sites in Mumbai. Two of them arrive at the overcrowded CST Train Station in South Mumbai, and before we know it, they start firing in the crowds. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the feature-length debut of Australian director Anthony Maras. Here he brings exactly what happened in the infamous Mumbai terrorist attacks (in plural). While I generally knew about his (mostly as it relates to what happened at the Taj Hotel), I didn't know much about the rest of it. Frankly, it is shocking to see it playing out as it did. First and foremost, I can't even put into words how shocking and sickening it is to see these cold-blooded murderers kill so many innocent people in such a savage way. It makes this movie hard to stomach, and at one point I almost left the theater. But ultimately I decided to stick it out, and I'm glad I did. The real heroes are a handful of brave men who decide to stand up against the terrorists and try and protect the hotel guests as best they can. The ineptitude of the Mumbai police and Indian special forces is as shocking as it is infuriating. Beware: in addition to the multiple execution-style killings, the movie contains quite a bit of hand-held camera footage. Maras does a great job of conveying the sense of panic which rose in the streets of Mumbai. Dev Patel plays Arjun, the Taj Hotel staff member, with the grace and dignity that we are used of him. The only other 'big name' in this production is Armie Hammer, playing one of the hotel guests. Also noteworthy is the excellent original score, courtesy of Volker Bertelmann (a/k/a Hauschka). Last but not least: not a single mention is made in the movie that this terrorist group came from Pakistan, and that these terrorist attacks brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war. This historical revisionism is simply inexcusable.'Hotel Mumbai' premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival, and is now getting a limited theater release. The movie opened this past weekend on a handful of screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. The Wednesday early screening where I saw this at was attended by exactly 2 people (myself included). Even though this is a good movie (in the technical and quality sense), I honestly cannot see this playing very long in the theater. For that the movie is too hard to stomach and even harder to forget. Maybe this will gain a larger audience when the movie is released on other platforms. Of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7,17,56,3 April 2019
Everest," Disaster movie that packs a emotional wallop
","'Everest' (2015 release; 122 min.) brings the true story of the ill-fated 1996 Mount Everest climb that writer Jon Krakauer (who was part of the expedition) later immortalized in his 1997 book 'Into Thin Air'. As the movie opens, we see a group of climbers ascending to Camp 4, and then we shift to 'Six Weeks Earlier', where a group is ready to leave the airport in Christchurch, New Zealand, on their way to Nepal. One by one we get to know who all is part of the expedition, including the expedition leader Rob, who has left his pregnant wife behind in New Zealand; Beck, a brash Texan; Doug, a humble mailman/carpenter, etc. etc. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, you may or may not remember that these events have been made into a movie before. In 1997, a quickie TV movie based on (and titled after) the Krakauer book 'Into This Air' was made, and promptly dismissed and forgotten. This time around, no effort, expense, or star power was spared, even with giving the reins to below-the-radar Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur (best known for '2 Guns' and 'Contraband'). Second, you may not remember the details of the expedition, but most of us do at least vaguely recall going in that things are going to be problematic, so the question is: will you still be transfixed? The answer is a clear yes! In fact, I will say that I was surprised how emotionally invested I became in some of the characters. In that sense, 'Everest' is very much like 'Titanic': yes, it's a disaster movie, but just as much, if not more so, it's also a love story. Third, is the movie worth the extra money to see in IMAX 3D? The answer is again yes! Mind you, I rarely go to a 3D or IMAX showing, let alone the combo. But unlike many movies shown in 3D these days, 'Everest' was shot specifically to show in 3D. And the 'action scenes' on and around Mount Everest are nothing short of eye-popping. Fourth, the movie sports an all-star ensemble cast, with some interesting performances. Check out in particular Jake Gyllenhaal as the loopy 'rival' guide named Scott, and also Keira Knightley in a small but very powerful role as Jan (Rob's pregnant wife). Bottom line: this is big Hollywood at its best, bringing us a disaster movie with all the bells and whistles and also packing an emotional wallop.'Everest' started out one week early on just IMAX 3D screens, and that is where I saw this at. It set a record for an opening weekend on IMAX 3D, and it has garnered much critical and, even more important, also positive word-of-mouth. The screening that I saw this at was very nicely attended for a week day early evening screening. I expect to have 'Everest' to have long legs at the box office. I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theaters, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, although it needs to be stated that a movie like this just begs to be seen on the big screen. Meanwhile, 'Everest' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",9,1,2,23 September 2015
Midsommar," Not so much frightening as it is disturbing, 'Midsommar' is way, way out there
","'Midsommar' (2019 release; 147 min.) brings the story of Dani and her friends. As the movie opens, it is snowing outside and Dani is frantically trying to reach her bi-polar sister. Turns out her sister has murdered their parents and then committed suicide. Dani leans heavily on boyfriend Christian for moral support, but because of that, their relationship seems in danger. After the opening credits, we find ourselves in May, and Christian and his 3 college friends are planning a trip to Sweden, at the invite of a college friend from Sweden, who explains that there is a week-long festival in his village that happens only once every 90 years. At the lat minute Dani decides to join the 4... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second film from writer-director Ari Aster, whose 2018 debut film 'Hereditary was a critical and commercial smash (I thought it was not the masterpiece that many others felt it was). Here he takes a different take on the grieving process, equally prominent in 'Hereditary', and a potential relationship break-up, all served up in what looks to be an idyllic commune in northern Sweden (or is it cult?). Given that this is a plot-heavy movie, I don't want to give a lot more background, so as not to spoil. But I will say this: the movie is a slowburner and the trip becomes stranger and 'strangerder' as we go along, to the point where you keep telling yourself 'what the heck?' The movie is at 2 1/2 hrs. a bit too long for its own good, but I was surprised how quickly time seemed to pass by. During the last hour of the movie, I sat frozen in my seat as I watched the thing unfold. The photography is gorgeous from start to finish (surprisingly, the movie was filmed in Hungary, not Sweden). Last but certainly not least, there is a stunning score, and in the end titles I noticed the score is composed by British musician Bobby Krlix, better known under his stage moniker The Haxan Cloak. I will surely be checking out the movie's soundtrack.'Midsommar' opened wide over the July 4th weekend. The Friday early evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati (in a fairly small theater) was PACKED. I noticed 2 people left about 45 min. into the movie, and didn't return. The rest of us sat transfixed, and you could hear a pin drop during the last 45 min. or so. If you are looking for counter-programming to the never-ending stream of superhero movies, sequels, prequels and other franchise garbage, look no further! 'Midsommar' is one of the most original films that I have seen this year. I encourage you to check out 'Midsommar', be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",8,13,26,7 July 2019
La La Land," An ol' fashioned Hollywood musical for the 21st century
","'La La Land' (2016 release; 128 min.) brings the story of Mia and Sebastian. As the movie opens, there is gridlock on the freeway and for no apparent reason we get the first song-and-dance by the ensemble cast, brought in a single take lasting several minutes, and ending with Sebastian and Mia having a mini-road rage moment. It's not long before we see Mia, a barista dreaming of becoming an actress, failing one audition after another. Meanwhile Seb is an ol' school jazz pianist. When he refuses to stick to the Christmas music set list at the club where he works, and instead goes on a dazzling improvisation, he is promptly fired. Mia happens to be walking by, hears the piano improvisation, and goes inside the club... At this point we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from writer-director Damien Chazelle, who last year came out of nowhere with is impressive debut film 'Whiplash'. For his sophomore release, Chazelle sticks to the music world, but this time in an all-around ol' fashioned Hollywood musical. When the movie's opening titles announce 'Presented in CinemaScope', you know this is going to be 'just like the good ol' days', and that certainly turns out to be the case. The musical numbers are simply outstanding, and just as important, move the film's story line forward. The movie benefits enormously from the obvious chemistry between the two leads, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. While the movie's overall story arc is quite familiar, you simply enjoy the scenes for what they bring. John Legend brings an important secondary performance as Keith, the leader of a jazz/R&B band called The Messengers. At one point Seb and Keith debate how 'authentic' the jazz sound of the Messengers should be. Keith observes: 'You're holding on to the past, but jazz is all about the future!'. Speaking of the musical score: if you are not into music, by all means do yourself a favor and find another movie to see, because in the end the music is the heart and soul of the film. As was the case for 'Whiplash', the music is courtesy of relative newcomer Justin Hurwitz (Harvard classmate of Chazelle, I read the other day). Heavy on jazz, but with plenty of pure orchestral moments as well, the core is nothing short of brilliant.'La La Land' is one of the year's most anticipated releases for me (as I absolutely loved 'Whiplash'). Due to various year-end scheduling conflicts and commitments, I just now had a chance to see it. The matinée screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. Much to my surprise I noticed a number of young (6-7-8 yr. old) kids in the audience. I would've loved to ask them afterwards what they thought of this movie. I loved the movie, period, and will end up high on my year-end list of best movies of 2016. 'La La Land' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",9,1,5,30 December 2016
Love & Mercy," Superb Brian Wilon bio-pic hits all the right notes
","'Love & Mercy' (2014 release; 121 min.) is a bio-pic about the life of Brian Wilson, the legendary Beach Boys singer-songwriter. As the movie opens, we get a clever montage of old footage (painstakingly recreated) of the Beach Boys' early successes. After the opening credits, we skip to the 1980s where an older Brian Wilson (played by John Cusack) meets Melinda Ledbetter (played by Elizabeth Banks) at a Cadillac dealership. She has no idea who he is. We then skip back to the 1960s, where we see the younger Brian (played by Paul Dano), after a panic attack and no longer touring, and blown away by the recent Beatles album 'Revolver', hatch what would eventually become the 'Pet Sounds' album. At this point we are maybe 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: any bio-pic of a music legend is going to be a highly subjective interpretation (check the Bob Dylan bio-pic 'I'm Not There' of a few years ago). In this case, director Bill Pohlad focuses on 2 specific periods of Wilson's life: the mid-60s as Wilson's mind slowly but surely gave in to 'the voices', and the mid/late-80s, when Wilson was under the legal guardianship of Dr. Eugene Landy (played by Paul Giamatti). Of course I cannot vouch whether things really happened as they are portrayed in the movie, but the movie certainly does feel quite authentic. I had seen the trailer a number of times beforehand, and was worried that the performance of John Cusack, who looks nothing like the real-life Brian Wilson, simply wouldn't work, in particular since Paul Dano as the younger Brian Wilson is so unbelievably on point. I needn't have worried, as Cusack makes you believe. But the best performance in the movie may well be by Elizabeth Banks, whom we most recently say in 'Pitch Perfect 2', both acting and directing. Here, she plays the loving girlfriend who decides that Landy needs to be stopped. Giamatti has a choice performance as Landy, about as unlikeable a character as you'll ever meet, but perhaps even worse is Wilson's dad Murray (played by Bill Camp), abusing/hitting Brian so badly and so often that Brian is 96% deaf on his right ear. There are quite a few tough and uncomfortable scenes in the movie that only reinforce the feeling that Pohlad didn't just want to do a 'love letter' movie about Brian Wilson. The key moment for me was when Wilson is playing a piano riff to Mile Love over and over and over again, as he tells Wilson 'I have this song stuck in my head, but I can't get it out', and it's becoming clearer and clearer that Wilson has become a prisoner of his own mind, and worse. (That piano riff would eventually become 'Good Vibrations, though.) Bottom line: this is an outstanding bio-pic, and any music history buff will want to see this.'Love & Mercy' opened last weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I finally had a chance to see it this weekend. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay, but just okay. I had been looking forward to this movie, and even though I had high expectations coming into this, they were met, and then some. One of the better music bio-pics I have seen in a long time. If you have a chance to check it out, be it in the theater, or eventually on VOC or DVD/Blu-ray, by all means do so. 'Love & Mercy' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",9,2,4,21 June 2015
Sicario," One of the very best, if also most brutal, movies of the year
","'Sicario' (2015 release; 112 min.) brings the story of the fight against a (fictional) Mexican drug cartel. As the movie opens, we are informed about the origin of the word sicario (zealots of Jerusalem) and that it is the Mexican term for hit man. Then we are immediately dropped into the action, as we see Kate and the rest of her FBI Special Weapons and Tactic Team overpower the tenants of a house in suburban Phoenix, only to make a gruesome discovery. It's not long before Kate, who wants to bring justice to whoever did that, is recruited to a joint task force with DOD to track down a drug lord in Mexico. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, who previously brought us the outstanding (and Oscar-nominated) film 'Incendies' a few years ago. Here Villeneuve examines the battle(s) between the Mexican cartels and the US government. Second, as the movie started playing out, when things are quite complex to grasp all that is going on, we find ourselves in good company, as it turns out that the Kate character is equally confused herself. It all becomes clear later on. Third, this is one of the most tense movies I have seen in a long, long time. From the opening scenes, you are clammed up as you're watching what is unfolding, and the amazing thing is that the movie simply DOESN'T LET UP. There are some unbelievable scenes that will have your jaw drop to the floor (no worries, I won't spoil). Fourth, it also must be stated that this movie is unrelenting in its violence and brutality. If that is a potential issue for you (and you know yourself better than anyone), please do not tempt fate. This movie is simply not for the faint of heart, and then some. Fifth, kudos to some outstanding performances, including Emily Blunt (as Kate). Watch her face when she expresses doubts about the legality of what is happening, and her superior tells her 'If you fear you're out of bounds, you're not. The boundary has been moved', wow. Benicio del Toro is equally top notch as the mysterious adviser to the joint task force. Last but not least, there is a fantastic orchestral score, courtesy of Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson ( who previously gave us the equally delightful score for 'The Theory of Everything'). Bottom line: 'Sicario' is one of the best movies I have seen this year, and that is saying something, as I see a LOT of movies.'Sicario' opened nationwide today and I couldn't wait to go see it. The evening screening where I saw this at in Cincinnati was PACKED, much to my surprise. Guess there still is demand for a top-notch quality movie that doesn't involve comic action heroes. If you can stand the violence and the unrelenting tension, do yourself a favor and go check this out, be it in the theater, or VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. 'Sicario' is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",9,3,8,6 October 2015
The Shape of Water," 'Life is but the shipwreck of our plans'
","'The Shape of Water' (2017 release; 123 min.) brings the story of Elisa. As the movie opens, we see Elisa getting ready for work. She and her friend Zelda work as janitors at a restricted government research facility. Along the way, we learn that Elisa is mute. Then one day, a new 'asset ' is delivered to the research facility. Mysterious at first, we learn quickly that it is some sort of amphibious creature. Elisa is immediately drawn to it. But the guy running the research project, a no-good scientist named Colonel Strickland, and his boss General Hoyt, have other ideas... What will happen to the creature? At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest fantasy story, if not fairy tale, from Mexican writer-director Guillermo del Toro ('Pan's Labyrinth'). Here he brings us a story that in its essence is a variation of 'Beauty and the Beast', or even 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' and the original (1932 and 1976) 'King Kong'. The movie is set in the late 50s or early 60s (at one point, on of the kids asks if he can watch Bonanza), and in fact the overall feeling of the movie is as it it was made in that era, rather than today. The Location of Elisa's apartment, above the Orpheum movie theater where 'The Story of Ruth' and 'Mardi Grass' are playing, only increases that overall late 50s/early 60s feel. The set productions is first rate all the way. The way del Toro directs the movie reminded me more than once of Steven Spielberg. Sally Hawkins is outstanding as Elisa. That makes two noteworthy movies this year for her: earlier this year she was equally stellar in 'Maudie', but watch her pile up the nominations for this film come the awards season (she already picked up a Golden Globe nomination). Last but certainly not least, there is a wonderful orchestral score composed by Oscar-winner Alexandre Desplat, and I'm going on record that he will score another Best Movie Score Oscar nomination for this.'The Shape of Water' opened up this weekend at my local art-house theater on not one but two screens, a rarity. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, I'm happy to report. Given the overall quality of the movie and the nice counter-programming to the inevitable blockbuster that is 'The Last Jedi', I can see this having long legs at the art-house theater circuit. Every day Elisa picks up a 'thought of the day' from her wall calendar, and on a certain day the thought is 'Life is but the shipwreck of our plans', and that certainly also seems to be the case for this movie, but in the best possible way. 'The Shape of Water' is a WINNER.",8,26,49,18 December 2017
The Disaster Artist," 'I Do Not Choose To Be a Common Man'
","'The Disaster Artist' (2017 release; 103 min.) brings the real-life story of how the 2003 cult movie 'The Room' got made. As the movie opens, a number of current day movie stars, including Kirsten Bell, Adam Scott. J.J. Abrams and others gush about the virtues of this 'so bad, that it's so good' movie. We then shift to 'San Francisco, July 13, 1998' when Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero meet at an acting class and strike up a friendship. Later that year, they decide on w him to move to Los Angeles, where Tommy somehow has kept an apartment. Tommy and Greg pursue their dream of becoming an actor (inspired by James Dean, among others), but when it's becoming clear that nobody wants to do anything with them, they decide to make their own film... At this point, we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is a labor of love primarily by James Franco, who directs, co-produces, and stars as Tommy. His brother Dave co-stars as Greg. The real life story is so beyond anything believable that if this were a work of fiction, it would immediately be dismissed as just that. Let me state upfront that I have not seen 'The Room' (although I see it frequently listed as a midnight listing at my local art-house theater). From everything we witness in 'The Disaster Artist', Tommy is so incredibly inapt yet convinced of his own talent, it reminds me of those American Idol auditions back in the day where certain contestants think they are super good yet they were horrible. Another similarity is the Meryl Streep movie 'Florence Foster Jenkins' (about a real life wealthy NY socialite who thinks she sings well and nobody dares to contradict her, leading to a notorious Carnegie Hall concert). James Franco does an outstanding job in the lead role, and I'm going to predict that he will get a number of nominations in the upcoming awards season. It isn't until the very end of the movie (when scenes from the original 'The Room' are played in parallel with the recreated scenes for 'The Disaster Artist') that one gets a sense how incredibly meticulous Franco has been in recreating them down to the last detail. Absolutely amazing. Last but certainly not least, the movie features a bunch of other well-known performers, some of them in very noticeable roles (such as Seth Rogen and Alison Brie), and others in 'blink and you'll miss it' roles (such as Sharon Stone, Zoey Deutch, Zac Efron, etc.). In an early scene of the movie, when Tommy and Greg become unlikely friends, they head over to Tommy's place, and Greg notices a prominent sign on the apartment's wall: 'I Do Not Choose To Be a Common Man'. Whatever you think of Tommy, he certainly is not your 'common man'!'The Disaster Artist' opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati on not one, but two screens (a rarity). The Friday evening screening where i saw this at was attended very nicely, I;'m happy to report. The audience roared with laughter on many occasions. The positive word-of-mouth this movie surely will generate makes it likely to have long legs at the box office (at least within the art-house theater circuit). If you are in the mood for something truly different, I encourage you to check out 'The Disaster Artist', be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",7,60,83,9 December 2017
American Made," Fast-paced and zany action-drama is Tom Cruise's best movie in YEARS
","'American Made' (2017 release; 115 min.) brings the story of Barry Seal. After a clever 1970s montage featuring Jimmy Carter's infamous feel-bad speech, the movie introduces us to Seal, a TWA pilot Who is not adverse to shaking things up a bit (literally causing turbulence). It's not long before Seal is approached by a CIA agent to do clandestine reconnaissance in South America. It's not long before Seal gets involved in the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia... At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie reunites director Liman with Tom Cruise, who previously teamed up on the well-received 'Edge of Tomorrow' (for which a sequel is being planned). Here they bring us ('Based on a true story', we are reminded at the beginning of the movie) the story of a TWA pilot turned CIA informant turned drug runner. The movie is divided up in chapters, from 'CIA '78' to 'Colombia '80' and so on. While the subject matter is quite serious and Barry Seal not particularly likable per se, the movie is fast-paced and zany, and is helped tremendously by Tom Cruise's charming and very effective performance. The supporting cast are for me relatively unknowns, including Sara Wright as Barry's wife, and Domhnall Gleeson as the CIA handler. A minus point is the incessant use of hand-held cameras as well as the use of extreme close-ups. Enough already! We get that it is an action movie! There are tons of great song placements in the movie, and when George Harrison's 'Wah Wah' plays of the closing moments and the end titles, it perfectly captures much of the movie's ebullience.'American Made' opened wide this weekend, and I was looking forward to seeing it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended poorly (about 20 people in a huge auditorium), much to my surprise. Perhaps strong word-of-mouth can generate a stronger box office performance in theaters. Regardless, this is bound to find a wider audience on VOD and eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. If you are in the mood for a quick-paced and charming drug-smuggling action movie that is Tom Cruise's best movie in, literally, years, you cannot go wrong with 'American Made'",7,5,8,30 September 2017
The Witch," More a psychological family drama than a horror movie (not unlike 'The Shining' was)
","'The Witch' (2015 release; 93 min.) brings the story of a 17th century family in New England. As the movie opens, we see the husband of the family at trial, due to religious disagreements, and the man and his family (his wife and 4 kids) are forced to leave the plantation and start life anew. Some time (a year?) later, we see the family having built a house and working the land in a far off place. Thomasin, the oldest daughter, goes out near the woods and plays peekaboo with the newest addition to the family, a baby boy. Then after another peekaboo, when she opens her eyes, the baby is gone. She frantically goes looking for the baby in the woods. At this point we are about 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the debut film of writer-director Robert Eggers, and what a debut it is! In the opening credits, we see that the movie's full title is actually 'The Witch - A New England Folk Tale'. The movie is billed as a 'horror' film, but if you are expecting a slasher movie or something explicit like The Exorcist, you will surely be disappointed. Think of 'The Witch' more in terms of the Stanley Kubrick film 'The Shining', also termed a 'horror' movie but in reality more a psychological family drama. Even though they are completely different movies, the parallels are uncanny: the isolation, the gradual breakdown of the family, and the ultimate insanity of it all. Newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy is sensational as Thomasin, but truth be told, so are Kate Dickie as the mother and Ralph Ineson as the father. BEWARE: the movie is spoken in 17th century English ('thee', 'thy mother', etc.) and I must admit that quite a bit of the dialogue flew straight over my head, I just could not grasp it (English not being my native tongue may be a factor, although I have lived in the US for 30+ years--I'd be interested in anyone else's perspective on this). Even with that 'complaint', I found this to be quite an amazing movie, furthermore so considering this was made on a nickel and a dime.'The Witch' premiered at the 2015 Sundance Festival and made a huge splash. I've been waiting to see it since. Not sure why it's taken more than a year to finally get a release in theaters, but better late than never I suppose. The screening I saw this at on the Friday evening of the movie's opening weekend was attended okay but not nearly as well as I had anticipated. Couldn't help but notice that a group of about 4-5 people left the theater midway through, and didn't return. I'm afraid that there was a gap between their expectations of this movie and what the movie really is. Yes, it is a 'horror' movie, in the same way that 'The Shining' is a 'horror' movie, but it is so much more than that. If you are in the mood for an outstanding original tale of one 17th century family's descent into insanity, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. 'The Witch' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,0,6,19 February 2016
Rosemary's Baby," 'All Of Them Witches'
","I recently saw 'Rosemary's Baby' in the theater (more on that later). As 'Rosemary's Baby' (originally released in 1968; 136 min.) opens, we get to know a young wedded couple, Rosemary and Guy. They are apartment shopping, and are delighted to find a place in the Bramford building. Rosemary gets to know Terry, who lives on the same 7th floor with an elderly couple, Roman and Minnie. Then one day when Rosemary and Guy walk home, there is a commotion in front of their building. Turns out Terry threw herself out of the window to her death... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this film marks the US debut of Polish director Roman Polanski, and what a debut it was. Now more than a half century since its release, and viewed as a timeless classic (it is currently rated 97% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), the movie provides a classic example where less is more ('Jaws' would follow that very same 'less is more' approach 7 years later, with equally superb results). I did not see the movie when it came out (I was only 8 years old at that time), but I have seen it a number of times over the years, although I cannot recall how long ago most recently-meaning, it's been very long ago. Other than the crucial scene where Rosemary sees the baby for the first time, I had very little recollection of the movie (for example: the scene where Rosemary gets the book entitled 'All of Them Witches' felt brand new to me). My reaction to seeing it again after so many years is that this is a textbook example of outstanding storytelling, aided by a wonderful cast and made cheaply ($23 million production budget in today's dollars, truly peanuts in today's Hollywood). Mia Farrow was a mere 23 when 'Rosemary's Baby' came out, yet she easily dominates the screen. What a shock it is when about an hour into the movie Rosemary changes her hairstyle ('Viddal Sassoon!' she notes) completely, and not for the better, I might add. John Cassavetes (as Guy), Ruth Gordon (as Minnie) and Sydney Blackmer (as Roman) are delightful. Keep an eye out for Charles Grodin (as Dr. Hill)!I recently saw 'Rosemary's Baby' in the theater for the very first time, of course the best way to experience any movie. It played three consecutive days at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati as part of the month-long 'Spooktober' festival. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended just okay (10 people). I myself am very happy that I got to see this again, and in the theater. If you are interested in seeing one of the all-time classics of psychological thrillers, I'd readily suggest you do so (and in a theater if at all possible), and draw your own conclusion.",9,1,2,13 October 2019
Steve Jobs," Comparing 'Steve Jobs' vs. 'Jobs', and the winner is...
","'Steve Jobs' (2015 release; 122 min.) is the latest movie about Steven Jobs. As the movie opens, we see archive TV footage of Arthur C. Clarke describing how he think the computer will dominate life in 2001. We then switch to '1984, Cupertino, CA, Macintosh Launch', where we see Jobs arguing with everyone to get the voice demo fixed. 'It needs to say Hello, because it can', Jobs observes. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Dannie 'Slum Millionaire' Boyle, with a script from Aaron 'The Social Network' Sorkin. The movie credits note that this is 'Based on the book Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson', but it is more accurate to say this is loosely inspired by the book, as the movie is almost nothing like the book. In fact, the movie only has three specific 'chapters' (the Macintosh launch in 1984, the NeXT box launch in 1988, and the iMac launch in 1998), although certain other pivotal moments are brought in flashbacks. The impression created by Doyle and Sorkin is that Jobs was an impossible guy to deal with, refusing to recognize his daughter Lisa (even though there was a 94% certainty he was her dad), for whom in the end 'the product' was everything, to the exclusion of anything else. I have no idea whether this is a correct reflection of Jobs, or an exaggerated one. But it makes for a heck of a movie. I must admit I was skeptical going in whether this was a good movie, but I was sadly mistaken. Michael Fassbinder is outstanding as Steve Jobs (even while lacking the physical resemblance), and maybe even better is Kate Winslet, virtually unrecognizable as Joanna Hoffman, Steve's confidant at the company. I thought Seth Rogen was equally fine as Steve Wozniak. Last but not least, there is a terrific soundtrack, courtesy of up-and-coming movie composer Daniel Pemberton. (There are also a number of Dylan songs, including 'Shelter From the Storm' over the movie's end titles, reflecting Jobs' admiration for Dylan.) A few years ago there was a movie called 'Jobs' (starring Ashton Kutchner), which is a very different movie altogether. It is a more traditional bio-pic, while 'Steve Jobs' is anything but that. 'Jobs' was readily dismissed as lightweight even by those who hadn't seen it, in part because of Kutchner, and that is a real shame, as he gave the performance of his life in that role, and it is a interesting movie. That said, having seen both movies, it is now clear to me that of the two, 'Steve Jobs' is the better movie, period. But I would encourage you to seek out 'Jobs' if you haven't seen it yet.'Steve Jobs' expanded nationally this weekend, and the early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely, but was by no means a sell-out. From all I can tell, the audience really liked the movie, and I think with strong word-of-mouth. 'Steve Jobs' will do quite well, also when the award nomination season starts later this year and into early 2016. Jobs was a one-of-a-kind person, and this movie certainly does not shy away from showing the lesser side of Jobs. 'I'm poorly made', admits Jobs. 'Steve Jobs' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",9,1,6,23 October 2015
Sausage Party," Zany, irreverent, and foul: an all-star voice cast more than delivers
","'Sausage Party' (2016 release; 88 min.) brings the story of a group of grocery store food items. As the movie opens 9with a glorious opening song), we get to know Frank Wienerton, a sausage, and his friends. They are all hoping that today will be the day that a customer will choose them, so that they can 'go to the great beyond' (i.e. leave the grocery store). Then one day, indeed Frank and a bunch of other food items are picked and tossed in a grocery cart, only to see things go wrong at the last minute. Is Frank stuck in the grocery store? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is the brain child of Seth Rogen, who has for years been trying to bring this story to the big screen. Now finally a studio decided to fund it, and Rogen and his circle of friends came up with this zany, energy-jumping, extremely raunchy adult cartoon. 'We keep our wiener in our packages', screams one of the sausages, and that's one of the more benign sexual double-entendres that pepper the movie. I assume you know yourself better than anyone else, so if this is going to bother you, do yourself a favor and stay away from this. I don't understand the many screaming headlines in other reviews that this is not for kids. The movie is rated R, so why would anyone even think about having kids watch this? The movie sports an incredible all-star voice cast: besides Rogen himself (in not one but two voice roles), there are Kirsten Wiig (as Rogen's girlfriend Brenda), Jonah Hill, Bill Hader, James Franco, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, and many more. I mentioned the rounding opening musical number, and as it turns out the music is from none other than multiple Oscar and Grammy award winning composer Alan Menken, as well as Christopher Lennertz.Bottom line: 'Sausage Party' is not for everyone. But if this is something that you think you might enjoy, it doesn't get much better than this this. The movie did much better than expected at the box office, and Rogen has already been quoted as saying he's been thinking about a sequel. Can't wait for that: 'Sausage Party 2: The Wiener Works'?",8,2,3,6 February 2017
Joker," Joaquin Phoenix sure to get Best Actor Oscar nomination for this
","'Joker' (2019 release; 122 min.) brings the origin story of Joker. As the movie opens, we are in Gotham City in the early 80s (late in the movie we see that 'Zorro the Gay Blade' is playing in theaters). A guy named Arthur is working various gigs as a clown (driving foot traffic for stores, visiting children at the hospital). One day he is savagely beaten by a group of young thugs. Arthur is shaking up badly. Meanwhile he pursues his dream of becoming a stand-up comedian, but things aren't going very well with that either... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Todd Phillips, best known for 'The Hangover' franchise. Here he goes a very different direction, bringing us the origin story of the famed Joker character in the DC Comics universe. Joker has been portrayed many times before (including Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger), but it typically came across like an over-the-top, caricature-like performance. Not so with Joaquin Phoenix. Here we truly get to understand the person that became Joker. Joaquin Phoenix is utterly brilliant, and I have zero doubt that he will pick up a Best Actor Oscar nomination (and many other accolades) for this. The script brilliantly reflects the chaos that existed in New York/Gotham in the late 70s/early 80s (garbage strike, super rats, etc.). Please note that this film is MILES away from your typical 'super hero' movie a la Avengers. For one, almost no CGI to speak of. Instead this is a dark, brooding and intense psychological thriller and character study. It is for me one of the best surprises of the year, period.'Joker' has been playing in theaters for weeks now, and I finally went to see it this weekend. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at in a large theater was very well attended, and that tells you about the staying power of this film. If you like your comic super hero movies dark and intense, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",9,0,3,21 October 2019
Pitch Perfect 2," 'aca-wedersehen, b*tches'... the gang is back and better than ever
","'Pitch Perfect 2' opens with our beloved a cappella band the Bellas giving a performance at the Kennedy Center in the presence of President Obama, when Fat Amy encounters a 'costume malfunction' of epic proportions. As a result of this 'muffgate' incident, the Bellas are suspended but negotiate a loophole: win the a cappella world championships in Denmark, and they regain full standing. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie. Will the ladies be able to pull it off? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this sequel is the full length feature directing debut of actress-producer Elizabeth Banks (she also reprises her role as Gail, the TV commentator), and Banks does a very capable job as director. The movie is paced perfectly, and even better, remains faithful to the spirit of the first Pitch Perfect. Let's face it, if you loved the first movie, all you want to see is the return of the original gang (mostly Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson, I suppose), and find excuses for them to sing and interact. This time around, the big rival for the girls is a German band called Das Sound Machine, and I have to admit, DSM sounds and performs impressively. We are also introduced to a new member of the Bellas, Emily (played by Hailee Steinfeld, the young girl in True Grit is now a young woman). Beware: there are plenty of fairly (c)rude jokes and lines in the movie (such as: Emily's last name is Junk-Hardon, no, really) so that even thought this movie is rated PG-13, frankly I wouldn't recommend taking young kids to this. Some of the better lines come from the TC commentators (played by Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins), but my favorite comes from Anna Kendrick's Beca character, when she hisses back to her DSM rivals 'aca-wedersehen, b*tches!', ha! The music is aplenty in this, even more so than in the first Pitch Perfect, and that's just fine by me (they even find a way of brining 'Cups' back again). Bottom line: despite the high expectations, Banks & Co. have managed to deliver exactly what the people wanted from this sequel, not a small feat. Not surprisingly, there is already talk of a Pitch perfect 3, with Rebel Wilson already signed on. For my money, if they can't find a way of keeping Anna Kendrick around, my interest in another sequel will nosedive.I saw the first Pitch Perfect knowing next to nothing about the movie, taking a flyer when it showed on its opening weekend. That screening was not all that well attended but I vividly remember how immensely I enjoyed that movie. Flash forward 3 years: I was really looking forward to seeing PP2. The early evening screening where I saw this at today (Sunday) was PACKED, and then some. The crowd absolutely ate it up, laughing at all the right times, and giving an applause when the house lights turned on. Many of them left as the movie's end titles started to run. A shame for them as they missed a very funny bonus extra which I won't spoil here. Just stick around when the end titles start running! Meanwhile, 'Pitch Perfect 2' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,12,23,17 May 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Nostalgia for Hollywood's golden age
","'Hail, Caesar!' (2016 release; 106 min.) brings the (mis)adventures of a fictitious film studio in the 1950s producing several films, including the 'prestige' film 'Hail Caesar!, A Tale of the Christ', starring Baird Whitlock (played by George Clooney). As the movie opens, we get to know Eddie Mannix (played by Josh Brolin), head of production who after going to confession (only 24 hrs. after the previous), gets a girl out of trouble. Meanwhile on the set of 'Hail, Caesar!', it isn't long before a couple of extras manage to drug Baird Whitlock and abduct him. As if all of that isn't enough, Mannix is being courted by Lockheed with a great and generous job offer. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writers-directors Joel and Ethan Coen, who most recently charmed us with 'Inside Llewyn Davis'. Here, the Coen brothers go into another tribute, this time the 1950s Hollywood studio system, still in full force but already past its peak. The Coen brothers bring us a parade of characters, too many to keep track of, and movies within the movie (at least four of them), all the while crafting picture-perfect scenes that are pure eye-candy if nothing else (check: the water ballet scene with Scarlett Johansson's character; the dance and tap foot scene with Channing Tatum's character, etc.). The movie is carried by the performances, more so than the story, and for me the big revelation is Alden Ehrenreich as Hobie Doyle, the singing cowboy who now must deliver in a regular speaking part. A number of the big names only appear briefly (Johansson, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, etc.). There is a wonderful score. courtesy of composer Carter Burwell, who seems to be everywhere these days (he's got 3 other films in the theaters right now, including 'Carol' for which he received an Oscar nomination, 'Anomalisa' and 'The Finest Hours'). Bottom lime: the movie works best as something to enjoy in the moment, without thinking about it too much. In that sense, while this is of course a fine movie, it is also one of the Coen brothers' more forgettable movies.'Hail, Caesar!' opened nationwide last weekend, and I finally had a chance to see it this weekend. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely (and leaning heavily towards seniors, I might add). As the movie's end titles started to roll, the guy seated next to me asked his wife 'what was the point of this movie?'. The answer is that there is no point to this movie, it is made to be enjoyed in the moment, with a good dose of nostalgia for Hollywood's golden age. If you have a chance to see 'Hail, Caesar!', be it at the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I encourage you to do so and draw your own conclusion.",7,2,4,13 February 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Rousing and fun reboot of the Kong franchise
","'Kong: Skull Island' (2017 release; 118 min.) starts a new chapter in the King Kong universe. As the movie opens, we are told it's 'South Pacific, 1943', and a US pilot and Japanese pilot crash land on a beach, and while they are fighting each other, Kong appears out of the blue. Cue forward and now we are '1973' (as we see Nixon announce the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam). Bill Randa is able to get a US Senator to approve a 'mapping mission' of an unchartered island somewhere in the South Pacific. After some quick preparations, including getting a military escort, off we go to that mysterious island... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest reboot of the King Kong franchise, more than a decade since the last one (by Peter Jackson). This time, Kong is bigger and better and 'badder' than ever before, and with lots of other monsters on the island, much to our viewing pleasure. The movie has a distinct 'Apocalypse Now' vibe going in the first part, even more so as the herd of helicopters approaches the island and is met by Kong. Once the action shifts to the island, there is a distinct 'Jurassic Park' vibe to it. We all know fully well that there is a lot of CGI in the movie, yet it never bothered me, and in fact I'll see that the movie feels very authentic from that perspective. The support cast is okay, with John C. Reilly (as the stranded US pilot now 30 years later) absolutely stealing the show (sorry John Goodman, Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston, et al.). There is a terrific score to the movie, courtesy of veteran composer Henry Jackman, and there are also a ton of song placements (Black Sabbath's 'Paranoid', CCR's 'Run Through the Jungle', etc.). BEWARE: this movie is rated PG-13 for a reason, as there are some frightening scenes that I believe are inappropriate for kids under the age of 10 or thereabouts.'Kong: Skull Island' opened wide this past weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was sold out to the very last seat. The audience LOVED this movie, and gave it an applause when the end titles started rolling. 'Kong: Skull Island' is nothing short of a rounding and fun reboot of the Kong franchise. I can't wait to see the next installment (reportedly due for 2019). 'Kong: Skull Island' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,14,26,13 March 2017
Arrival," Why are they here and how do we communicate with them?
","'Arrival' (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of a group (12, to be exact) spaceships arriving on earth, and how mankind deals with it. As the movie opens, we see a woman (Louise, we later learn) with her daughter over the years, with her daughter passing away due to a rare disease. What is going on here? Louise turns out to be a linguist, and when a spaceship arrives in Montana, she is recruited as a translator. Turns out the aliens are 'talking' through complex symbols. At this point, we are less than 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, one of my favorite film makers of this generation. He is on an amazing streak of quality movies. His movie from last year 'Sicario' was my No. 1 movie of the year, and before that he brought us 'Enemy', 'Prisoners' and 'Incendies'. Here, he goes sci-fi, with the arrival of aliens, and leaving us wonder 'why are they here?' and 'How do we communicate with them?'. If you are expecting an all-out sci-fi action movie (think 'Independence Day'), you will be sorely mistaken, as this is more the 'brainy' type of a sci-fi movie. Think more 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', minus the action scenes, and with tons more of 'attempting to communicate' scenes. Despite the mostly serious tone of the movie, there are some lighter moments too. After the very first attempt to communicate with the aliens goes nowhere, Louise asks the Army Colonel 'Am I fired?', ha! Amy Adams (as Louise), Jeremy Renner (as the scientist) and Forest Whitaker (as the Colonel) are fine in the lead roles, but really take a backseat to the overall sci-fi setting of the movie. The photography is outstanding, and sometimes pure eye-candy. Last but not least, there is an outstanding soundtrack, courtesy of Johann Johannsson (who also provided the score for last year's 'Sicario').'Arrival' opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (but wasn't anywhere close to a sell-out). If you are in the mood for an 'intellectual' sci-fi that takes another look at the eternal issues confronting mankind when aliens come to earth (why are they here and how do we communicate with them), then this movie is right on target, and worth checking out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. 'Arrival' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,6,16,12 November 2016
Parasite," South Korean movie is original, witty and storytelling at its very best
","'Parasite' (2019 release from South Korea; 132 min.) brings the story of the Kim family. As the movie opens, we get to know the family: they live in a semi-basement apartment, and mom and dad are out of work, and their teenage son and daughter aren't in much better shape. Then one day, the son's friend Min informs him that he is leaving the country, and that it would be good if the son takes over for him as the private English tutor of a HS sophomore girl, whose family is well-off, if not rich. The son agrees, and before we know it he is now the English tutor... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Korean writer-director Bong Joon-ho, best known for his 2013 'Snowpiercer' film. Here he brings a one-of-a-kind story that is so plot-heavy that I cannot take any risks in spoiling anything, so my comments will be brief. Let me say this: there is a good reason that 'Parasite' won the top prize (Palme d'or) at this year's Cannes film festival, and I will already go on record that there is zero chance that this movie isn't getting an Oscar nomination early next year for Best Foreign Language movie. The movie is everything that Hollywood at its worst (with endless sequels, prequels, franchises and 're-imaginations') isn't: It's original, it's witty, and it's storytelling at its very best.'Parasite' got a limited release in New York and LA in early October, and has gradually been rolling out to more cities. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. Man, I couldn't wait to see this! The Friday late afternoon screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (10 people), but I am quite certain that as word of mouth gets around, this will find its box office legs in the weeks to come. If you are in the mood for a top=notch foreign movie that is original and witty and will have you on the edge of your seat, I'd readily suggest you run, don't walk, to check this out, be it at the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",8,1,6,2 November 2019
The Water Diviner," 'You can find water but you can't find your own boys?'
","'The Water Diviner' (2014 release from Australia; 111 min.) brings the story of Joshua Conner (played by Russell Crowe) and his family. As the movie opens, we are reminded that the movie is 'inspired by true events'. We are transported to December 20, 1915 to the Battle of Gallipoli, where the Turks are overpowering the ANZACs. We then switch to 'North Western Victoria', where we see Conor looking for, and finding water (and building a well). At dinner time, Connor's wife is resentful. 'You can find water, but you can't find your own kids?', she hisses. Shortly thereafter, she drowns in the lake near the house. After the burial, Connor decides to go to Turkey to look for his three sons, whom he urged to fight 'for flag and country' and who are presumed dead. At this point we're just 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, it is remarkable that it has taken this long, but this movie marks the directing debut of Russell Crowe. Why he hasn't taken this up sooner, I don't know, but better late than never. Second, the movie makes an almost critical error by not giving a brief historical background note at the beginning of the movie. Do you know who the ANZACs are, and why Australian soldiers ended up fighting in Turkey 100 years ago? I sure didn't. I picked up bits and pieces along the way as the movie unfolded but still, I felt that was an oversight that could've been easily avoided. Third, the script does a good job in providing flashbacks of the Gallipoli battle which eventually reveal what happened to the Connor boys. At the same time, while the movie is 'inspired' by true events, let's be honest here and just say it outright: this is a historical fictional drama, and quite entertaining, but fictional nevertheless. Last but not least, Crowe leads a cast of mostly unknowns (for me anyway). The little boy who leads Connor to finding a hotel in Istanbul is just delightful, and the little boy's mother is stunningly beautiful. Bottom line: this movie makes for an enjoyable and entertaining historical drama (it won Best Picture at the Australian version of the Oscars this year).The movie finally opened this weekend on two screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. The matinée screening where I saw this at was attended okay, and it seemed that the audience was really enjoying the movie quite a bit. This isn't going to see the box office on fire here in the US, but it's a nicely made movie, showing a softer side of Russell Crowe as well as demonstrating that the man certainly knows hoe to direct a movie. If you are into historical dramas, you cannot go wrong with this. Definitely worth check out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",7,2,5,26 April 2015
Mother!," Hints of Rosemary's Baby but nowhere near as good as that classic
","'Mother!' (2017 release; 125 min.) brings the story of a couple living in a remote house. The woman wakes up, but her husband is up and about already. We later learn that he is a well-known writer but suffering from writer's block, and that she is restoring the house room by room. Then out of the blue a man comes knocking on the door and the husband invited him in, even though he doesn't know him. Turns out the guy thought their place was a bed-and-breakfast. To the wife's surprise and dismay, her husband invites the man to stay the night. Then the next morning, the stranger's wife comes knocking at the door... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Darren Aronofsky, who previously brought us the excellent 'Black Swan' and 'Requiem For a Dream', among others. Here he goes in a very different direction and brings us... what exactly? a haunter house scary movie? a psychological terror drama? If you have seen the movie's trailer, you have a pretty good idea what to expect, that is, in the first 45 min. of the movie. After that, the movie goes into a completely different direction. No worries, I won't spoil, but I will say this: I was at times bewildered as to what is going on, at times annoyed, at times fascinated. In other words: the movie is all over the place. It is for me one of the weaker movies that Aronofsky has made to date. Jennifer Lawrence gives her all, and is quite good. Javier Bardem has a difficult role as the inherently unlikable husband. Ed Harris plays a small but vital role as the stranger, as does Michelle Pfeiffer as his wife. An what to make of those final 15 min. of the movie? I couldn't make heads or tails of it, except that I kept thinking about 'Rosemary's Baby', although that classic is better than 'Mother!' by a mile or two.The movie opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended poorly (less than 20 people in a huge theater), and that is not a good sign for a movie just opening. Bottom line: if you are a fan of either Darren Aronofsky or Jennifer Lawrence, I'd suggest you check out this movie, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",3,10,16,17 September 2017
Creed II," As predictable as it is enjoyable
","'Creed II' (2018 release; 130 min.) brings the on-going story of Creed. As the movie opens, we are in 'Kyiv, Ukraine', where we see.... Drago (!) and someone we presume to be his grown-up son, getting up and go our for training. We then switch to Creed, now a lifetime 23-1. getting ready for a world heavyweight championship fight, which he wins fairly easily. Meanwhile, Creed is getting ready to propose to Bianca, whom we also learn is pregnant... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to reveal more of the plot should spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this latest installment in the (never-ending?) Rocky-Creed franchise is directed by up-and-coming Steven Caple Jr., although truth be told, the presence of Sylvester Stallone (who co-stars and co-wrote the script) is never far away either. Rocky is still doing his thing at Adrienne's Restaurant, with the occasional mentoring/managing of Creed. The parallels between this film and 1986's 'Rocky IV' are uncanny. It also makes this film utterly predictable. But don't say that it's not enjoyable, because it is quite enjoyable. It's really interesting to see how carefully the Rocky franchise essentials are being used and protected in the continuation of that franchise that is 'Creed'. I find the return of Dolph Rundgren (as the original Drago) and, in a much smaller role, Brigitte Nielsen (as Drago's ex, and of course ex-Mrs. Stallone in the real world) quite good. By the time we get to the glorious last fight, I am emotional 'all in'. Now we'll have to wait 2-3 years for the next installment of this franchise...'Creed II' opened wide (and commercially successful) over the Thanksgiving weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati during its second weekend was attended okay (about 20 people). If you have seen any of the prior Rocky/Creed movies and count yourself a fan of them (and you know who you are!), I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DBD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6,0,1,3 December 2018
Blade Runner," 'Los Angeles, November, 2019' - an unforgettable movie theater experience
","I saw 'Blade Runner' in the theater again today (more on that later). First time I saw this film, it was the original version when it came out in Belgium (where I grew up) in 1982. Decades later, I saw it again, this time on DVD and in the 'Director's Cut' or 'Final Cut', I can't quite remember. The version I saw today was definitely the Final Cut.'Blade Runner' (originally released in 1982; The FInal Cut released in 2007; 117 min.) brings the story of Deckard, as he tracks down 4 replicants who have escaped from an Off World and need to be 'retired' with extreme prejudice. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is 'Los Angeles, November, 2019'. YES, this very year! In Ridley Scott's (bleak and dark) vision of the future, LA is in permanent darkness and rain, with lots of pollution, and lots of overcrowding. Our man Deckard (Harrison Ford) meets Rachel (Sean Young), who may or may not be a replicant, who can tell for sure? In the meantime Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is the leader of the replicants and up to no good...While watching this in the theater today, I was struck by several things: first, the enormous vision from Ridley Scott this movie asked for (and received). Second, the set design and production is out of this world STILL, now almost 40 years later. Third, while there is very little 'action', this movie flew by in no time (same as its Blade Runner 2049 sequel, incidentally). A movie like 'Blade Runner' begs to be seen on the big screen. As luck would have, my art-house theater here in Cincinnati is doing a month-long sci-fi classics festival during July, and this was the first (and certainly not the last) that I was eager to see again in the theater. The July 4 matinee screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, and I imagine the later screenings will be PACKED. If you have a chance to see 'Blade Runner' in the theater, run, do not walk! It makes for an unforgettable movie theater experience.",10,8,12,4 July 2019
Blade Runner," Standing the test of time 35 years later
","2017 marks the 35th anniversary of the original release of 'Blade Runner', and also the year that its long-rumored sequel, 'Blade Runner 2049' will be released (later in the Fall). In anticipation of that, I decided that I needed to see the original, which I hadn't seen in several decades (if not longer). Of course, when we talk about the original movie, what we really mean is the definitive 'Director's Cut' that was released 10 years ago (to commemorate the 25th anniversary).'Blade Runner: The Final Cut' (117 min.) opens with the reminder that it is 'Los Angeles 2019' (yes, only 2 years from now!), and we get the stunning introduction to what the City of Angels has become. It's not long before we are introduced to the Harrison Ford character, a guy who is running down ' human-like replicants'. Couple of thought on seeing this movie again after all this time: 1. 'Blade Runner' is NOT an action movie (although there is some of that), but rather a neo-noir psychological drama and character study. It's no wonder that US audiences didn't warm up to the original release all that much, expecting a sci-fi action movie. yes, it's sci-fi, but there the comparison stops. 2. The movie's visuals and photography are stunning still, even after 35 years. 3. It is absolutely remarkable how much cigarette smoking takes place, throughout the entire movie no less. This is surely one thing that Ridley Scott got totally wrong. But on the other hand, his premonition of climate change (even though that term didn't exist yet in 1982) was in the right direction (and supposedly will be even more central in the 2049 sequel). 4. Scott's version of LA 2019 has it as a mostly Asian, Tokyo-reminding, city. 5. The soundtrack from Vangelis remains as majestic now as it was then. 6. Last but certainly not least, it's amazing to see the lead performers (Harrison Ford, Darryl Hannah, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer) so.... young!Bottom line: 'Blade Runner' circa 1982 was far ahead of its time. Now in 2017, it feels a lot more 'contemporary'. I have no idea what to expect from 'Blade Runner 2049', but I can only hope it's not 'just another sci-fi action movie'.",10,0,2,18 July 2017
Jojo Rabbit," Using absurd and black humor to expose Hitler and Nazi Germany
","'Jojo Rabbit' (2019 release; 108 min.) brings the story of Jojo. As the movie opens, 10 yr. old Jojo is pledging allegiance to his imaginary friend Adolf Hitler, while we also get clips of Hitler-mania in Germany, as the Beatles' Komm Gib Mir Deiner Hand plays along. Jojo joins the Hitler Jugend traning camp in what we learn are the waning months of the Third Reich. Returning from camp, Jojo is startled to learn that a Jewish girl, Elsa, is hiding in the attic, helped by Jojo's mom. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest work from New Zealander Taika Waititi, who recently directed 'Thor: Ragnarok' and before that the excellent 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople'. Here Waititi not only directs, but also wrote the scrip, produces, AND stars as the wacky Adolf Hitler (as imagined in the mind of a 10 yr. old boy). There is lots of humor, mostly of the absurd if not black kind, but along the way plenty of points are made as well about intolerance and hate and the absurdity of war. British newcomer Roman Griffin Davis is nothing short of sensational as the young boy. His mom is played by Scarlett Johansson. Australian actress Thomasin McKenzie, outstanding in 'Leave No Trace' is excellent as the Jewish teenager Else. Surely we have not seen the last of her (or of Davis). There are excellent song placements in the movie, including Love's 'Everybody's Gotta Live', Roy Orbinson's 'Mama' and David Bowie's 'Helden', which plays in the very last scene of the movie and then over the end titles.'Jojo Rabbit' premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September to positive buss. After being released in NY and LA, the movie gradually rolled out to other cities and it made its way to Cincinnati last weekend. I finally got around to seeing it this weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very well, a bit to my surprise as this is NOT a very 'mainstream'-like movie. If you are in the mood to check out a new perspective on Hitler and Nazi Germany with a heavy dose of absurd and black humor, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",8,2,7,10 November 2019
Son of Saul," Harrowing and haunting
","'Son of Saul' (2015 release from Hungary; 107 min.) brings the story of a Jewish Hungarian man named Saul. Saul works/is forced to work as a 'sondercommando' in one of the German concentration camps (Auschwitz? Birkenau?). As the movie opens, the camera focuses on Saul as he goes from job to job, leading the next wave of Jewish prisoners towards the gas chambers and closer to their death. Then, miraculously, a young boy survives the gassing. A German doctor quickly smothers the life from the boy, and orders an autopsy. Saul, however, wants to provide a proper burial for the boy and desperately seeks to find a rabbi among the Jewish prisoners who can say the 'kaddish' (burial prayers). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: in my life time I have seen quite a few movies that focus on or relate to the WWII concentration camps. I can honestly tell you, though, that 'Son of Saul' is a unique film. The primary reason is that (i) the movie is shot in almost 1:1 ration, actually probably more like a 4:3 ratio, and (ii) the camera focuses mostly on Saul, and rarely do we get a full-blown shot of what goes on around him. Not that we don't know, and certainly when you add the outstanding audio-soundtrack, we know all too well that this is living hell, and worse. Bodies are laying about, we hear the furnaces, we feel and recoil as chaos and pure evil unfolds. It all make for a very harrowing movie, but one that is unforgettable. It is often said about the holocaust that we should never forget. Let me tell you: 'Son of Saul' will make you never forget. Géza Röhrig in the role of Saul brings an epic performance, with little dialogue, but body language that speaks volumes. I am going to go on record right now that 'Son of Saul' will win Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar in early 2016.I saw 'Son of Saul' during a recent home visit to Belgium. The early evening screening where I saw this at in Antwerp was attended okay but not great. That is a darn shame, but on the other hand, if you are simply looking for a 'good time at the movies', I don't know that I would recommend this, as it's simply not that kind of movie. On the other hand, if you believe in 'important' movies, and on top of that it happens to be a top-notch quality movie, you cannot go wrong with this, be it at the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. 'Son of Saul' is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",10,33,57,16 November 2015
Midway," Midway (2019) vs. Midway (1976): and the winner is...
","'Midway' (2019 release; 138 min.) brings the story of the WWII battle of Midway. As the movie opens, it is 'December 4, 1937', and British, US and Japanese dignitaries are exchanging toasts in the name of peace. We then go to 'December 7, 1941', as the Japanese are starting to attack Pearl Harbor... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by Roland Emmerich, yes, he of 'Independence Day' (and its sequel), '2012', 'White House Down', and so on. That is really all you need to know to put this latest version of 'Midway' into perspective. Character development is minimal, but who cares anyway, as we all await the battle scenes. Once they come, starting with Pearl Harbor and culminating in the movie's last hour with the actual battle of Midway (on June 4, 1942, amazingly only 6 months after Pearl Harbor), all restraint is thrown overboard, and it's almost an assault on the senses. And yes, quite enjoyable. The thing is that the battle scenes are perfect, frankly too perfect. Think of it like watching video games on steroids. I can't help but think back to the 1976 movie of the same name covering the same events (starring Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda), when CGI was not available and the movie makers used other means (including actual archival footage from the battle). While I enjoyed the Roland Emmerich re-imagination of Midway better than I expected, I nevertheless feel that the 1976 movie is slightly better, or perhaps I should say that it feels more realistic. Please note: Emmerich financed this $100 million production movie independently outside the Hollywood studio system, and he ended up getting a sizable part of the budget financed through Chinese investors. That comes at a cost of course, and hence the script makes a couple of unnecessary, if not questionable, detours into China's role (?) in the battle of Midway. A darn shame.'Midway' opened wide several weeks ago, and I finally got around to seeing it. The Friday matinee screening where I saw this at the day after Thanksgiving was attended okay (about 20 people in a large theater). If you have an interest in WWII and/or in big budget war movies, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7,1,2,30 November 2019
Life," Where 'Alien' meets 'Gravity': thoroughly entertaining
","'Life' (2017 release; 103 min.) brings the story of a 6 person crew on the International Space Station. As the movie opens, we see the crew getting ready to intercept a capsule flying through space. The capsule contains samples retrieved from Mars. Having caught the capsule successfully (which is filmed in one long shot, just beautiful), we get to know the crew, with members from the US, the UK, Russia and Japan. The British biologist finds there is life in one of the samples, and he nourishes it, and even giving it a nickname (Calvin). But alas, things don't always look what they seem, and before we know it, trouble is brewing... At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie but to reveal more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by up-and-coming Swedish director Daniel Espinoza. If you have seen the movie's trailer (which has been hard to escape in recent weeks), you know exactly what to expect. In essence this is a mash-up of where 'Alien' meets 'Gravity', the latter due to the spectacular in and around the ISS and space. The real question hence is: how does the movie measure up relative to the 'trapped in space' genre? I am happy to tell you that the movie measures up very nicely, thank you. Almost from the get-go, tension is palpable and I found myself screaming out loud and even looking away from the screen a couple of times. When that happens, you know the movie is getting to you, in the best possible way. There are just enough plot twists to keep the action going quasi non-stop. Jake Gyllenhaal as the senior medical officer who is starting his record-breaking 473rd consecutive day in space ('I like it up here!', he says) leads the cast. Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson is yin to Gyllenhaal's yang. Ryan Reynolds as the ISS pilot has a much smaller role. Last but certainly not least, Swedish composer Jon Ekstrand (who has scored several of Espinoza's earlier movies) delivers an excellent orchestral score that matches the film perfectly.'Life' opened wide a few weekends ago and has done okay at the box office, although for a movie of this caliber (and budget) with this cast, it certainly feels like it should've done much better. Cut-throat competition from higher profile movies like Beauty and the Beast, Kong: Skull Island, Power Rangers and now Ghost in the Shell certainly isn't helping. I can only say that I was more than pleased, and thoroughly enjoyed 'Life' for what it was. I'd readily recommend you check this out, be it in the theater, VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",7,2,7,31 March 2017
Green Book," Safe and predictable from start to finish
","'Green Book' (2018 release; 130 min.) is 'inspired by true events' we are reminded. As the movie opens, it is 'New York City 1962' and Tony works as a bouncer in the Copacabana club. When club closes for renovations, he needs another job. One day he gets a call: a doctor needs a driver. The given address turns out to be Carnegie Hall, and the 'doctor' is in fact acclaimed pianist Dr. Don Shirley. After some back and forth, Shirley hires Tony, and off they go... At this point we are 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you will just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie directed by Peter Farrelly, who along with his brother, has brought us 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'There's Something About Mary', among many others. Here he goes a very different direction, namely on the one hand another take on 'The Odd Couple', and on the other hand the racial tensions in the deep south in the early 60s. As to the odd couple Tony and Shirley, it provides for some comic relief (much of the theater crowd roared approvingly). As to the racial tensions, they are as predictable as they are mind blowing that this went on just 60 years ago. But truth be told, if you want to see a movie about those issues, there are far better movies than this one. Viggo Mortensen tries way too hard to be a convincing Italian-American from the Bronx, and that is true as well of the family gatherings early in the movie, you can practically hear the director yelling '..and ACTION'. Mahershala Ali (as Shirley) fares somewhat better. Kudos for the production sets (I never tire of the cars from that era).'Green Book' expanded wide this weekend. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at was, much to my surprise, packed to the rafters (mostly seniors, I might add). If you are in the mood for 'The Odd Couple' meets 'Driving Miss Daisy', I readily suggest that you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",5,78,160,26 November 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," The rare sequel that is better than the original movie
","'John Wick: Chapter 2' (2017 release; 122 min.) continues the 'adventures' of former (?) hit man John Wick. As the movie opens, we are immediately thrown in the middle of a car vs. bike chase, and next thing we know, we find our man retrieving his beloved Mustang from a chop shop in NYC, but not without cars flying about, and dozens of dead or wounded bodies. And that's all in the pre-opening credits! As the story unfolds, Wick, who wants 'out, is nevertheless forced back 'in' when an Italian baddie calls in a favor and Wick has no choice but to accept. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: director (and former stunt man) Chad Stahelski returns at the helm following the surprise success of the first John Wick movie, and once again delivers a highly stylish and ultra- violent action movie. When you watch the opening car chases (yes, in plural), it's like watching a synchronized ballet performance. I would not go as far to say that the story line doesn't matter, it does to a degree, but let's be honest: the reason we are there is to watch the car chases and the shoot-outs and the almost cartoonish level of violence that is so over the top, you can't help but laugh at it. Stahelski's thinking must have been: 'when in doubt, (i) throw more bodies at it, and (ii) keep the focus on Keanu Reeves'. Reeves is cold as ice in the best possible way, and it suits him perfectly in the film. Laurence Fishburn plays a small role (as another baddie) and the scenes where Reeves and Fishburn appear together are their first joint scenes ever since the Matrix Trilogy, if you can believe it. I couldn't believe how quickly these 2 hours flew by and I'm not spoiling anything when I tell you that the movie's ending sets it up nicely for a Chapter 3 in a couple of years. Count me in!The movie opened wide this past weekend, and the Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at was absolutely jam-packed, somewhat to my surprise. Did I mention this movie is ultra-violent? And that it's rated R for good reason? I was outright dismayed to see how many small kids were in the theater. In the very row in front of me, there was a couple with three small girls, I'm guessing ages 5 to 7. What are these people thinking?!? Meanwhile, for us grown-ups, if you liked the first John Wick, you are more than going to like this sequel, you are going to LOVE it, be it at the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu- ray. 'John Wick: Chapter 2' is a WINNER.",8,14,24,13 February 2017
Annihilation," 'Many theories, few facts'... another sci-fi from Alex Garmand
","'Annihilation' (2018 release; 115 min.) brings the story of Lena. As the movie opens, Lena is being debriefed upon her return of a trip, the sole survivor of an expedition to figure out what is going on in 'Area X'. We then go back in time: we witness something from outer space hitting a lighthouse (but we don't know what exactly), and then Lena's husband Kane returns home after having been away for 12 months on a covert mission and Lena thinking he had died. Kane is clearly very sick, and when Lena takes him to the hospital, government forces intercept the ambulance and the are both taken to a compound called the Southern Reach... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Alex Garland, who previously brought us the excellent sci-fi 'Ex Machina'. Here Garland does another sci-fi project (working from Jeff VanderMeer's novel of the same name). It's quite mysterious as to what exactly is happening. When Lena tries to extract some basic facts from the doctor-psychologist, she simply tells Lena 'Many theories, few facts', and that will have to do it. The first half of the movie muddles along, and it isn't until we reach the second half that things really take off, as we start to understand what is really unfolding. There are some terrific (and terrifying) scenes in that second half that will have you holding on to your seat... (I shan't say more). Natalie Portman is wonderful as Lena. Oscar Isaac seems bewildered as her husband Kane. Jennifer Jason Leigh is almost unrecognizable as the doctor-psychologist. The movie's photography is a bit heavy on CGI special effects. Last but certainly not least, there is a spectacular original score, courtesy of composers Portishead's Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury (they also scored 'Ex Machina') that I plan on seeking out.'Annihilation' opened this weekend, and I was looking forward to catching it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (less than 10 people in huge theater), and I can't say that it surprised me as it seems the movie is struggling to create an identity while also trying to escape the attention-grabbing blockbuster 'Black Panther'. Nevertheless, while it is not quite as exquisite as 'Ex Machina', I found it worthwhile, and I'd recommend you seek it out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6,12,33,24 February 2018
The Nice Guys," Pleasant 70s-era crime caper: Angourie Rice steals the movie
","'The Nice Guys' (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of a couple of private eyes looking for a missing girl. As the movie opens (to the tune of 'Papa Was a Rolling Stone'), we are reminded that it is 'Los Angeles, California, 1977'. Before we know what hit us, a car comes flying around the corner, crashing into a house and killing its driver, whom we later learn is Misty Mountains, an adult film star. We the get introduced to Holland March, a private eye who is down on his luck, and separately also to Jackson Healy, the guy you call on 'to bring a message'. It's not long before Healy is hired to 'bring a message' to March. At that point we're a good 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from writer-director Shane Black, who previously brought us Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3, among many others. Here Black takes us back to the golden era of police and private eyes dramas and film noir, but with a never missing smile (or is that smirk) on his face. Second, don't worry about the insanely complicated story line, in which I got lost in no time. Instead, enjoy this movie for the many outstanding performances: Ryan Gosling (as March) brings comedy to the screen like I've never seen him do before (the 'bathroom' scene is destined to become a classic). Russell Crowe (as Healy) plays it rough and gruff, the perfect counterpart to Gosling's role (the ying and the yang), so in that respect, this is a great 'buddy' movie. But with all due respect to Gosling and Crowe, the movie is stolen by newcomer Angourie Rice, who plays Merch's 13 yr. old daughter Holly. She seems like is was born to play in movies, that's how natural she comes across. Surely this is only the beginning of a long career for this young lady. Kudos also to the set designers, who did an outstanding job recreating what 1977 looked like (the 'Jaws 2' poster, Tower Records, etc. ), And last but not least, there is an overabundance of outstanding music from that era featured throughout the movie, from the opening sounds of The Temptations' 'Papa Was a Rolling Stone' to when Al Green's outstanding 'Love and Happiness' plays over the movie's end credits.The movie opened nationwide this weekend. Having seen the trailer a number of times, I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (but nowhere close to sold out). If you are in the mood for a 70s-era crime and buddy movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, you cannot go wrong with this. 'The Nice Guys' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,7,15,21 May 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," 'One more! Help me get one more!'
","'Hacksaw Ridge' (2016 release; 131 min.) is 'a true story', as we are reminded at the beginning of the movie, of conscientious objector Desmond Doss and his incredible heroism in WWII. As the movie opens, we are right in the middle of the battle of Okinawa, with bodies flying left and right, and in slow-motion. We then shift back to 'Blue Ridge Mountains, Virginia', where we get to know your Desmond and his little brother, along with their deeply religious parents. One day, during a fight with his brother, Desmond hits in in the head with a stone, almost killing him. Then we go 'Fifteen Years Later' , as America is getting ready for WWII. At this point we're 10-15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: 'Hacksaw Ridge' is directed by none other than Mel Gibson, making a return from 10 years in Hollywood wilderness. Gibson has been a pariah, and whether that is justified or not, I will leave to others to discuss. One thing is clear, though: the man knows how to make a movie. Here, he finds a combination that suits him just perfectly: religion and violence. The first part of the movie shows us what Doss as a conscientious objector had to endure simply to be able to serve his country, while the second part gives us the Battle of Okinawa in May '45. The parallels between this movie and Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' are obvious. Beware, the battle scenes in 'Hacksaw Ridge' are extensive, and leave nothing to the imagination, making this latest Gibson movie 'bloody good'. The heroism of Doss is nothing short of awe-inducing, and humbling. With each life saved, and running on fumes, Doss keeps praying 'one more! help me get one more!', wow, just wow. How it is that this man's story hasn't been made into a movie sooner, I have no idea, but better late than never. At the very end of the movie there are a couple of clips, showing Doss accepting the Medal of Honor (the first conscientious objector to do so), and also being interviewed in 2003. Andrew Garfield is outstanding as Doss. This movie feels like it was made in another era, and I mean that as a compliment. Kudos to Gibson and the overall production team for a job well done.'Hacksaw Ridge' opened this weekend, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati, was pretty close to a sell-out. I think this movie is going to have long legs in the theater as word-of-mouth gets around about this 'Saving Private Ryan'-reminding and overall feel-good if tough WWII drama. If you liked 'Saving Private Ryan', you will not want to miss this, preferably in the theater as this is the type of epic movie that will lose some of its effectiveness on Amazon Instant Video or DVD/Blu-ray. 'Hacksaw Ridge' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,5,11,6 November 2016
Macbeth," Is there anything Michael Fassbender can't do? Marion Cotillard equally stunning
","'MacBeth' (2015 release; 113 min.) is the latest big screen adaptation of the William Shakespeare play. As the movie opens, we see a small child's funeral (turns out to be the child of MacBeth). After the opening credits, we are given a very brief synopsis as to the overall situation, with MacBeth being loyal to the King, and it's not long thereafter that MacBeth leads the troops in a decisive battle. Meanwhile, we get to know Lady MacBeth, who has grander plans for her husband. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie version of the famed Shakespeare play is directed by little know Australian director Justin Kurzel (his brother Jed composes an outstanding orchestral score, and I noticed in the movie's end credits that Justin is credited with playing the drums in the score). Kurzel gives us a very stylish and visual interpretation of the play, with stunning photography from start to finish, pure eye-candy, The early battle scene is nothing short of epic, with at times ultra slow-motion photography for further effect. Michael Fassbender, whom we just saw recently as Steve Jobs, now incarnates MacBeth, and he brings a heartfelt performance. Is there anything this guy can't do? His list of recent performances is nothing short of daunting (MacBeth, Steve Jobs, Frank, 12 Years A Slave, Shame, and of course X-Men). He is one of this generation's leading actors, period. The minute Lady MacBeth comes onto the screen, I thought to myself 'this face is familiar'. It wasn't until 10 or 15 minutes later that I suddenly realized 'holy cow, it is Marion Cottilard!'. She plays Lady MacBeth without any trace whatsoever of a French accent, in perfect. It is nothing short of stunning to see her incorporate Lady MacBeth (check out her monologue late into the movie, as she is tortured with guilt and shame, it will leave you in tears). Speaking of language: it took me a good 10-15 minutes to get used to the early 17th century English language of Shakespeare's era, and even then, I will readily admit that quite a few of the lines simply bypassed me. If the DVD version comes with subtitles, you probably will want to take advantage of that. The movie was shot on location in England and Scotland. Have the Scottish highlands looked ever more beautiful? And the use of the spectacular Banburgh Castle will leave you in awe. Bottom line: eve if you are not a fan of Shakespeare as such, you will likely be taken in by this latest adaptation, if nothing else by the photography and the lead performances from Fassbender and Cotillard.'MacBeth' opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early evening screening where I saw this at on Friday evening was attended quite well, frankly to my surprise, as I had figured that demand for this kind of movie would be limited. But I'm glad that I was wrong on that account. If you are in the mood for a highly stylish interpretation of 'MacBeth' that features stunning performances from the lead actor and actress, you cannot go wrong with this. 'MacBeth' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,2,3,14 December 2015
Alien: Covenant," Entertaining if utterly familiar and predictable
","'Alien: Covenant' (2017 release; 122 min.) is the latest addition to the 'Alien' franchise. As the movie opens, we see David, a synthetic android, in discussion with his creator. 'If you created me, who created you?' wonders David, We then go to 'December 5, 2104', on board the space vessel Covenant. A major deep-space shock wave causes most of the crew to awaken (seven years too soon), and even killing one crew member. It's not long before an unknown earth-like planet comes along, and the captain of the Covenant decides to send a group of about 10 crew members down to check it out. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: Ridley Scott returns as director to what he calls the sequel of 'Prometheus', which also was just vaguely connected to the original 'Alien' ('Prometheus' and 'Covenant' being prequels to 'Alien'). The story line is all too familiar, and frankly predictable, from the get-go. Yet I enjoyed 'Covenant' more than I did 'Prometheus' for a couple of reasons: one, there is a lot more horror action in 'Covenant', and very well done at that (it's been almost 40 years since the original 'Alien', and film-making technology is more sophisticated, for one); second, Michael Fassbender is front and center in this, playing not only David again (which he also did in 'Prometheus'), but also a newer generation android called Walter, who serves on the Covenant. Katherine Waterston is supposed to be the 'new' Sigourney Weaver (but nobody can pull that off, sorry). Watch out for a blink-it-and-you'll-miss-it cameo from James Franco (less than 30 seconds). The production is slick and exquisite throughout. In all, there is nothing 'wrong' with this movie, although when all was said and done, I was a bit disappointed with the utter predictability of it. And there is more where this came from: already a further sequel to the prequel has been announced, with the possibility of more after that (I guess as long as there are people buying enough tickets, they'll keep making them).'Alien: Covenant' opened wide this past weekend. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was packed to the rafters, which didn't surprise me, given it was the movie's opening weekend. In any event, the commercial success of the movie will depend more on the international markets, not the US. If you are in the mood for more slickly produced deep-space horror, 'Alien: Covenant' is right up your alley.",6,2,8,22 May 2017
The Martian," 'Castaway' in space meets 'Gravity': 'Luckily I'm a botanist!'
","'The Martian' (2015 release; 141 min.) brings the story of Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon). As the movie opens, we are informed this is Acidalia Planitia, a plain on Marxs, and we see Mark and the rest of the crew picking up rock and sand samples. Then a sandstorm quickly moves in, forcing the crew to abandon the mission and escape. In the confusion, Mark is hit by debris and presumed dead. Except that he isn't. Mark realizes that the next mission to Mars won't get there until 4 years from now. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from director Scott Ridley, hardly a novice in sci-fi movies (Blade Runner, Alien, Prometheus). Here, he tackles the big screen adaptation of the popular book by Andy Weir. I did not read the book, so I cannot comment how closely the movie tracks the book. Second, seemingly no expenses were spared in the production of the film, and much of it is just eye-candy. Third, the parallels between this and other movies are so obvious: the initial two-thirds of the movie is basically 'Castaway' in space, as we follow Mark in his quest to survive until the rescue comes, and the last third is even more blatant in going where 'Gravity' has gone before. Fourth, kudos to Matt Damon for bringing a heartfelt performance. But what about Kristen Wiig? She looks lost and unsure why she's even there (compare this to her brilliant performance in the recent 'Diary of a Teenage Girl'). And didn't Jessica Chastain just do another space-travel movie? (Yes, 2014's 'Interstellar'). Fifth, there is a very nice orchestral score, courtesy of composer Harry Gregson-Willians. And Jessica Chastain's character loves 1970s disco, so we get a bunch of true-and-tried (or is that true-and-tired?) classics such as Turn the Beat Around, Hot Stuff, Rock the Boat, Love Train, and, yes, I Will Survive. Last, this film is rated PG-13. Not that it stops Mark from dropping the F bomb on several occasion (I thought the F bomb automatically earns a movie the R rating?).'The Martian' opened nationwide this weekend and the matinée screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was absolutely jam-packed. The audience loved this movie. As much as I was ready to also love it, I can't help but feel let down by the lack of originality, in particular in the latter part of the movie. It's like watching 'Gravity' again, but not as good. I encourage you to check out 'The Martian' for yourself and draw your own conclusions.",6,4,61,3 October 2015
