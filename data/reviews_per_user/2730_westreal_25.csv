Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Better than Jackass !
",This is a combined effort of documentary and film about stupid people and how someone can get by like the goose trough the water. Sasha outdone himself by letting go all of his emotions and making the movie so realistic. Greatest laughs were in the scenes where he portrayed the 'player' in the hotel and at the diner...with the S**t :)). I know it's not a movie who can win Oscars..it is not intended to do so..it's just funny..raw truth about disturbing facts that surrounds not only the American people but the whole world. 'For make benefit' -a great description about it.. but will it make a change?? i hope so. I liked it..gave it 10 just because some people gave it some 1'2 and 2's..which is not funny :). I almost forgot...i think some people don't understand that there are still nations and many human beings that are not aware of moving stairways and subways and all..i know for fact people in my country that haven't traveled outside their rural area never..and i'm sure if taken right in the heart of an American metropolis or better a Japanese one.they would freak out or act very stupidly(funny)..so..don't judge a book by it's cover!,10,8,13,27 January 2007
Mission: Impossible III," Action Movie of the year
","Alongside Laurence Fishburne and Ving Rhames ,Tom makes one of the best action teams of the year.Phillip Seymour-Hoffman is a great asset as the bad guy in this movie and plays an interesting tri-legged role.The action part of the movie overcomes the bad script it has (most of it pretty loose) and the only thing i didn't miss from this was the party .Everything in special effects,credible stunts and all is done professionally and you can easily enjoy a good(probably the best) action movie of this year.Even tough the actresses are not Hollywood stars (big) we still enjoy pretty much their performances too.I sure hope to see an MI-4 soon . Enjoy it !",8,0,0,30 October 2006
Deja Vu," Timeline changes
",This is one of the good movies about time-line changes..it involves many controversial subjects but also keeps u separate from all and because Jim plays the terrorist's role u even tend to like him a bit.There are many movies out there about time traveling but none who could explain so much as this one the possibilities.I enjoys it first of all for the subject and second for Denzel which i consider to be a great actor..for any type of movies..even though he plays so many cop roles and so accurate (i would let him join the force if i were an American ).I don't want to spoil anything for the ones who haven't seen it yet so i'll just say the same thing : Go save her Danzie !,9,0,1,17 August 2007
Friday Night Lights," Overrated,but generally good !
","The movie is kinda' overrated and starts somehow..undefined, but generally it can bring you out of your seat to cheer or it gives you the feeling that you must intervene in some parts.The director's unsteady camera can make you dislike the movie, but in my opinion it makes it more original and closer to reality ( nothing is steady in life ). If you are a sports fan , you might wonder why are some missing parts in the movie..like strategy on the field and some other stuff too.Criticising movies like this is hard because not everyone understands the movie the same way..some may see it brutal some...passionate..everyone has its way.Go and watch it,,but don't expect too high !",7,0,1,31 January 2005
The Prestige," Simply Amazing
",This has got to be one of the most amazing films i have ever seen.truly...fantastic..exuberant...best place to be ever.It was recommended to me by friends but i never listened until one lonely night in which i said to myself..i have to go see it..and i did: the result is i was dazed..and still am..a great story acted almost without flaws..accents and lust.Kane was just outstanding...his way of narrating the story kept me so close to it that i was living it by the end.I am the spectator that wants to see behind the stage..that will search for answers...Go see it if u haven't so far ! Fantastic !,10,2,3,3 August 2007
Batman Begins," The Best Batman Installment
","From the beginning we realize this is not just a simple batman movie..another action flick with little comedy effects,it's the most complex story of batman ever told.Should we get surprised or not? I guess the answer would be yes ..considering that i've seen lots of batman movies but neither was up to the expectations.One of the most interesting things is the fact that nothing compares to a good entertainment but the best way to entertain is to keep the movies above people's expectations ! The symbolic meaning of the movie is more powerful than anything seen...we could find a Bruce Wayne in each of us..any moment.Are You ready for this adventure?",9,0,0,1 September 2006
Meet the Fockers," Get's trough your heart..to the end !
","I was thinking in many ways when i saw this movie.Generally the comedy genre has to do some build-ups until the cake splashes and a lot of fun gigs happen',but in this movie it's not like this.Probably it's not the best and maybe should'v had more fun...but definitively has a great finish.And what is best about a movie if it isn't the finish...that final part of the movie..when you are enjoying yourself with laughter and some joy-tears...well..that's why i gave it a 7 out of 10.No matter where you go..no matter where you'v been there's nothing like..the good old family.I'm usually not very critic about movies so i don't want to say where it lacks but the movie has it's downsize as well..so..enjoy the fockers and have fun !",7,1,2,6 November 2005
Blood Diamond," TIA: This is Africa
","What could be better than a movie with American actors playing such good and well crafted roles ! Leonardo it's just amazing, same is Jen and Djimon, even The Mummy's Imhotep,Arnold Vosloo is playing great, and the story...ah the story...what more could you want than just to be right in the middle of a Hot Zone,to finally get a chance to understand why Diamonds cost so much,why Africa still has slaves and why Rich Europeans have always hands dirty ! TIA, a very nice expression which represents all ,the sum of events in this movie.One can only watch this movie and judge by his standards..what is right and what is wrong !A must see movie !",10,0,0,16 November 2007
Drag Me to Hell," To the edge ,but not exactly there
","The movie at hand is a first person view on a 3D world basis.You,as a viewer react more often than the actual 'victims' themselves.Every breath you take in is deep,strong and articulated to the last inch of the pulmonary muscle.The director and scriptwriter ,Sam really made a work of art here,unfortunately the big picture didn't had the proper frame to it.There are too many discrepancies in the storyline and the actual life-happening things that cannot succumb to our consciousness properly.The end was so predictable but awaited for,that the spectator really enjoys every last bit of the movie.An outstanding soundtrack which made it one of my best horror movies alongside The Descent.Enjoy it as it is,no further recognition.",8,1,3,6 November 2009
The Departed," The new born departed
",This is a totally awesome movie from start to finish..a great cast..some undisputed performances...everything is almost perfect..From a Director that knows his best angles..specially in a story like this..comes a work of art that touches (even with such gore) and i might say that nobody expected the ending (unless there's a book ).All the actors have done an outstanding job but Jack performed 'crazy'.He is an actor which you can't get enough of watching..and although he was the bad guy (in a way) we still felt sorry for him in the end.My only disappointment is to the Head Shots scene..i think it was a little too 'fake' ..specially because there was a key element missing (spoiler). All the Departed were the new born (as their life were turning points)!!! Go watch it..i's fabulous !,10,3,6,30 November 2006
Glory Road," Best way to tell a story! Live it !
",There will be a lot of differences of opinion about this movie..but none of them could even come near to compare to the reality...in reality boys become men after all...and life isn't just a movie.This is a movie about life and must be taken as it is..but also all viewers must mind the fact that in movie industry sometimes a little bit of script altering is necessary in order for the movie to have fluency and spirit..there are many stories out there about events of life..it is important the way you tell them..not to stray from the truth..but neither to stick only in between it's lines..One of the best Sport-related movies i've seen in long time..and not just because of the story..is it because the way the characters were interpreted.A big hooray and let's hope they don't stop making them.PS: i would love to see movies like this about soccer too(even if in US it's not that popular),10,0,0,26 November 2006
The Holiday," What makes a movie great !?
","One might ask himself...what does make a movie great? Is it the story alone?Is it the actors?The Score?The Special Effects?What does? My guess is :all of the above,simply mixed in a way only great artists have done so with the most of their original and extraordinary work.A movie is art and making sure that all the little pieces fit together is what makes a movie great.The Holiday has (almost) all.It has a great (even though many times used) story,a phenomenal Score (Hans Zimmer outdone himself again),a great distribution and an amazing feeling added to it by the balance keeper 'Arthur'...we all need wisdom sometimes and having the best of this feels like having it all. I beg you to go watch this movie if you haven't. It is absolutely great !",9,2,4,8 August 2008
30 Days of Night," A new vampire way is born
","This has to be a spin-off for the vampire cult movies,better than anytime gore and vampire mimic..great story that evolves little by little to a horror and terrifying action movie.I honestly hadn't had so much suspense since Jeepers Creepers.Josh accepted this role and i'm glad that he did..he was great even though it's not his kind of movie genre..but that makes it even more interesting.Also it was a different and interesting scenery in the Alaska for a vampire movie .Loved it..gave it a 9 just for some script flaws but in general it's a great spin-off . Go out and watch it ! It's worth every penny for entertaining purposes. PS: Fierce creatures ahead !",9,1,1,8 December 2007
Wedding Crashers," Good Comedy
",Where is the fun? i say it's in everything that you want and nowhere you don't. this movie plays a guitar of romantic comedy..and also has flaws..like quail hunting but they actually don't see no quails and 'they are overpopulated'.i think that scene was totally inappropriate.but that's just my opinion.that's why i gave it an 8.the rest..good.the most interesting part is actually the beginning..where you can realize that whatever you do with your life..you can have a share of fun..and a piece of the pie! Good job for everybody but i believe that Rachel is better in movies like The Notebook...here she makes the movie sad..she didn't had one line funny...OK.i'm done! See it and vote !,8,1,2,23 October 2005
Man on Fire," Too good but not well rated,why?
","Today's people like to watch 3 hours of chat movies or let's say theatrical drama viewed on screen rather than watching a movie about real life, about true feelings , about finding your meaning in life to keep on going.This is why i wonder why this movie never got more than 7.3 I do not argue , it is not a 10 but nor is it a 7..and i have seen it more than twice, the result...same impression.Probably because at least 10 % of the voters are influenced by the ratings already online so they are lowering their note or raising it if on the page says so. That's no way to vote..but i'm not writing this comment just for this. My message to movie lovers is : keep watching but do not stare..cause even if u have a very beautiful wife/husband or girlfriend/boyfriend at home..if you stare..it might look ugly :)).",10,2,5,29 January 2005
The Wrestler," Great Acting
","A story that doesn't surprise by anything else but the raw true facts surrounding it.It is a story about life and the way it unravels before us...in it's last breath moments.When you're down the only way is up ! and Mickey Rourke manages to express it so well in this depiction of a traditional 80's mega-star wrestler.In my opinion,stories about life should be done as much realistically as possible...and this is how they did it here.It almost feels like a documentary at some points and that's the key of making the audience feel great. A round of applause for both Mickey and the rest of the crew ! Great Acting,great cast,great way of putting it all together ! Watch it !",9,1,1,25 January 2009
The Good Shepherd," True story..but disappointment for life
",A baffling story about commitment above all..about true love always and about being righteous.Matt Damon proves again he is Oscar worthy and the fact that De Niro was 'The Good Shepherd' in this movie tells a lot. From the way the screenplay was written (authentic i might add) to the way it was directed it is a truly moving film with a true story..but as i said in the summary..it is very disappointing as life..not being able to sustain love..always looking out for ur loved ones from a distance..making them believe that u are not too good as a father/husband.. Ah yes..and the loneliness..that crazy feeling of not trusting anyone..anything..anyplace..anytime. Great acting by Angelina..she is a good actress..not just a babe. She and her recent husband deserve each other. It was worth watching and insightful...maybe CIA will let us know some more of it's dark old secrets :))) Enjoy !,9,3,6,17 January 2007
The Blind Side," Not your average sports movie,but a best !
","Such a great true story was incredibly put onto the big screen with a warm & light look from a family's eye-view & a great adult to childhood's way of seeing things.Every viewer can take what's in front of him how he likes it.You can watch the movie from the perspective of a young restless colored boy,a happy family's payout or a nobody to stardom sports tale.I looked the entire movie with all 3 perspectives in mind and i definitely felt great on all of them.It made me laugh,sigh,cheer,and laugh again.On times like these we learn to appreciate more the comings and goings of true people and last but not least the education,what it means and what stands for.Great acting by all of them and great screening of a story. Enjoy it !",10,1,3,10 December 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," HAck it in !
",For the computer lovers it is a bit irrational..specially those cute executing boxes shutting down with a menu :).Anyways..it is a fantastic film..i loved it..i generally enjoy watching movies without questioning the background..after all it is a movie not real life right? John McLane--an outstanding figure fighting evil.it is one of my heroes.All the other actors are good too..keeping the spectator entertained and it makes the movie a lot better when u see new (old) faces as well.Some action scenes might prove too strong and impossible but it is just a part of the entertaining ... I would watch it again just for the fun of seeing Gabriel's face when he finds out his girl is....well...that's a spoiler. Go watch it if u haven't ..just great action entertainment !,9,1,4,6 August 2007
Fantastic Four," Besides Special Effects !
","The movie manages to contain every marvel aspect...the told and untold,the fiction,the reality,everything is WYSIWYG (for the ones that know).i must say that i've given this movie a lower grade that deserved but just so maybe my comment will get seen.It is probably not the best movie this summer but nice to see on the screen unfamiliar faces.and of course that big question..'when is the sequel?' i like sequel movies,but how can we 'upgrade' if every time the sequels fail..most of the 2nd parts of good movies are done just for the money..let's hope this one won't fit the pattern.Cheers everyone and enjoy quality effects,not so nice lines and a lot of Fantastic 4.",7,1,3,22 October 2005
Sin City," Way too overrated
","Who would have thought a movie like this can go straight to 250 top? Imean what's so special about it? It's got nothing more than a bleak idea and an unbelievable gore,things that should not make people feel any better but it actually does because where there's no sanity there's nothing! What's the plot? Why are the events so stupidly going on? This is just like Kill Bill volumes..bleak,with empty action ,no feeling kinda movie,and BTW,i have a colour TV..what's so interesting to see a movie B/W with three colours of blood? It's just my opinion,not a fact. The actors played almost perfect and the make-up was supreme but this is'n enough to be there in the top spot.Probably the large variety of actors in this movie made it so good .Watch it but with no high expectations!",7,4,7,31 August 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," No matter the costs:Ultimate love story
","Even though the movie itself isn't as serious as the final pieces of the puzzle,it is incontestably the best movie of the year,the best depicted story and the best acted movie in a decade.Slumdoge Millionaire hits every corner of a viewer's heart.It really makes you tick.It is the national anthem of all movies :Jai Ho ! Whether you are at home,at cinema,at a friend's DVD-home-cinema party...you will enjoy this half-musical drama.The characters development into the story are so deep that you can't possibly mistake one with the other...the director made from the audience...a part of the story.Probably it is and will remain for a long time one of the greatest achievements in cinematography and directing. 'What a night'",10,2,5,23 January 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," Super Performances
",This is one special movie ! With no doubt it was time for Will Smith to give a mature and wonderful performance. but he is not the best actor in the movie..i'll say his son is way above average kid play..just amazing and happy. The movie story is so actual to some parts of the world..and so moving...to pursuit your dreams ..to try anything for u and your loved ones..to never let go for nothing..to have no fear and to say : Hope dies last ! I would have given it more than 10 for the soundtrack too..it is so moving..and so well timed.. If u haven't seen it yet..get ready to the story of a lifetime...and there's no happiness in the movie :). If i could judge i would vote for will smith's Oscar..but who knows..Enjoy !,10,1,1,14 January 2007
V for Vendetta," Pretty Impressive performances
","As the world turns! As the leaders moans! This is an well directed/acted movie..with a special bleak but not shadowed story..a fictional one indeed..but also a bit true.Can you believe all the nonsense that you see on a TV screen all day? No You cannot and must not.life is way beyond limits.people are people wherever they are and no leadership should be more important that what life is.very good music,sound fx,graphics,voice editing...almost perfect.Lots of extras..not like a war movie but still....and by the way Hugo Weaving has such a tremendous talent,he should be proposed for Oscar! Natalie Portman..a princess of acting..nice sweet voice and rough character..could easily impersonate anyone(even boys).Great Movie(still has some minor flaws in SF facts..but good indeed) !!",10,1,3,10 September 2006
The Island," Could be perfect?
","A world not so far apart from ours.the reality is near and everybody knows this.maybe not cloning but rich and powerful enough is possible too...considering the fat that poor people can be owned again,like slaves..and until we say stop they feed us with raw unreality! the best thing i like about movies like this are the 'hidden'commercials.i say they should put more commercials and let down the price for screening the movie..i don't like paying for a movie and after to be disappointed,cause the trailers are just for disappointment,right? In the end i loved the movie and the actors were far better than Hollywood itself ! Maybe they should find more 'diamonds' quicker. Good Job !",9,2,3,21 October 2005
