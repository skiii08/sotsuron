The Blair Witch Project," Don't believe the hype !!!
","This film's documentary on the SCI-FI chanel was scarier the the film itself. The audience I saw it with laughed the whole way through. There were a few tense moments, but I certainly wouldn't call the film scary. The Haunting (probably the worst film of '99) had me on the edge of my seat more than Blair Witch. For some people to say this film is scarier than the Exorcist, get your heads examined. My suggestion is stay away from this film, unless you like disappointments.",1,1,3,13 December 1999
