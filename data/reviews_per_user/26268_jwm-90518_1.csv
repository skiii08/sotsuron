Blade Runner 2049," Explosive and jaw dropping visuals, but felt incomplete
",It's a shame that the films with the most hype never live up to their potential. The true star of the film was Roger Deakins BSC with his immersive cinematography. But I left the theatre saying to myself 'wait that's it?'. I'm not sure if the production is gearing up for another sequel or if it wanted to leave things open to the viewer but something just felt empty wj=hen the credits began to roll.,8,0,2,29 January 2018
