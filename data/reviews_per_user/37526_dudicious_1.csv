The Ring," genuinely freaky! worth 8 bucks!
","i can't believe this masterpiece came from the same director as the mexican! this is the ONLY movie that has ever scared me to the point that i wanted to cry.  yes, i'll admit it, i was about to cry in the theater i was so damn scared.when i walked into the theater i was expecting another horror/thriller with gratuitous violence, tons of flash imagery, and cheesy special effects. what the movie delievered was the exact opposite.  there was a perfect balance of flash imagery, terrific editing, and special effects that would impress even the most anal retentive critics.  this was what really made the movie.naomi watts (the blonde from mullholand drive) delivered an excellent performance, as well as the other actors.  brian cox's performance was a bit forced in his 'special' scene, but i don't think it was his fault.  with some better writing and build up to his character he could have blown away everybody.bottom line, if you want to have the living hell scared out of you, go see this movie!  absolutely terrific!  i'll be buying this one on dvd for sure.",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
