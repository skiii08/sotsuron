Marie Antoinette," Beautiful!
","I have to say that I feel sorry for the fact that many people are criticising this film. I saw it last night, and I thought it was such a beautiful film. It jumps to the point that Marie was just bored, bored of life. It shows how she was discovering new ways, and how these after a while became boring. So every day would be almost the same as the one before. Its beautiful, it shows the feelings, it is amazingly artistic as well. the ending is just perfect, it leaves more for the imagination its beautiful. Plus it is not meant to be a historical film. Also the scenery and camera work was really good as well, very beautiful. I loved this film, its a must buy. and whoever cant see that this film could be said to be a masterpiece, its missing out in the beauty of it. Although I have to admit the movie is very long, its not the type where you get bored but just sit there taking in all the detail. And i think you will only like it if you like slow moving artistic films. The blend of modern music with the past was amazing, it really did fit with the film.",Null,3,6,23 October 2006
