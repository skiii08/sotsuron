The Equalizer," Amazing!
",This movie was so good words cant explain. It was slow in the beginning but that was to g I've background info about the upcoming plot. However when the back-story was told and the movie started the movie was just amazing. The action lasted for 45 min and the story was just unpredictable even until the end. Also if you are worrying about the R rating it has no sex or nudity. This movie kicks ass and so does Denzel Washington kicks but! (Again because lack of line expectations).
