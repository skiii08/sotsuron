The Blair Witch Project," More Hype
","This film is far from original, it's simply a spin off of the cult classic CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, as well as MAN BITES DOG, and LAST BROADCAST. In fact, Blair Witch Project is simply a RIPOFF of all of these films. Blair Witch Project was nothing more then hype. It was un-interesting, awfully boring, with poor acting from the males in the cast, horrible characters, and un inspired dialogue. It seemed to me it was just Jerry Springer in the woods. Instead of starting a fire, or following the river out of the woods, they just walked around for an hour.This film was far from scary, unless you are afraid of twigs,and at best a tad bit creepy. The camerawork was poor in most scenes, and there were complete blackouts on the screen many times during the film.I suggest those who call this an original film rent the titles I stated at the first of my review. Blair Witch can be summed up in one word: CRAP Pokemon is more interesting, and is much more original, then anything I saw during Blair Witch.",Null,0,1,29 August 1999
