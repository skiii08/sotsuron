Gremlins," Joe Dante RULES!
","Joe Dante is one of my favorite modern-day schlock filmmakers. When you think about it, that's what he makes. 'Gremlins' is the jewel in his crown, a wickedly funny horror/comedy that still charms me every Christmas.Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) is a nice young man with a loving family. His inventor father (Hoyt Axton) gets him a little creature called Gizmo (voice of Howie Mandel) that looks like a cross between a teddy bear and Yoda for Christmas. There are three rules to keep in mind when taking care of Gizmo: 1. Keep him away from bright lights, they hurt him. 2. Don't get him wet, he'll multiply. And most importantly, never, ever feed him after midnight. As you can imagine, all three rules are broken, Gizmo spawns a bunch of nasty ugly Gremlins, and all hell breaks loose.The movie is very funny in it's mean-spirited way. My favorite scene is where the Gremlins, after wreaking havoc, go to a movie theater and watch 'Snow White'. They love it, and they start singing along to 'Heigh-Ho' (to Billy's amazement). The payoff shot is Gremlin heads bobbing in tune to the song. That always gets a laugh out of me. The gremlin effects are good, and little Gizmo is like a less-annoying Furby. The script by Chris Columbus is dark and menacing without being an R-rated outing (although apparently the original script is even worse), and I wonder how Columbus ended up making 'Home Alone' and 'Mrs. Doubtfire'. No matter; 'Gremlins' is a high-energy B movie that spawned a hilarious sequel. It's one of my favorite movies.",10,1,2,4 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A grand addition to the saga
","'Star Wars: Episode I-The Phantom Menace' has been subject to some of the most severe backlash against a Star Wars film in history. I loved it personally, and it's a worthy addition to the great trilogies.The visual effects are, needless to say, fantastic. There's the awesome lightsaber duels, big epic battles between armies, and a wonderful 10-minute Podrace that had me grinning throughout.Now, as far as the acting goes, it's less than stellar. But is that what this series is really about? No, this is Star Wars, not Macbeth. And yes, Jar Jar Binks is annoying, but I just tried to ignore him whilst he was on screen (although his clumsiness is funny).Anyway, this is a great Star Wars movie, and George Lucas has done it again.",10,0,1,22 May 2005
50 First Dates," A change of pace for Sandler
","'50 First Dates' is more of a romantic comedy than an Adam Sandler comedy. Sure, there's sexual and crude humor throughout the film, but they're not the main focus of the film. I thought 'Anger Management' was hilarious, and I'm going to see 'Happy Gilmore' as soon as I can. But enough about that. Adam Sandler is charming here, as is Drew Barrymore. This bizarre tale of love in Hawaii is funny, sweet, charming, and just plain feel-good. It loathes me to write that sentence, but it's true. I love the part where Drew Barrymore beats the bejesus out of Rob Schineder with a baseball bat. Rob Schineder is the most hilarious part of the film as Ula, the perverted Hawaiian local who is Henry's best friend. Overall, '50 First Dates' is a pretty good movie.",Null,0,0,18 June 2004
Catch Me If You Can," A pretty good movie
","I really liked 'Catch Me If You Can'. Now, I am willing to forgive Leonardo DiCaprio for all the bombs he's been in lately. I'm also willing to forgive Christopher Walken for the same reason. DiCaprio, Walken, and Tom Hanks are all strong in their performances. This is a very enjoyable Spielberg film. Now, granted, I've liked everything I've seen of Spielberg's work and have yet to see a bad movie by him. Also, the bouncy John Williams score is a nice touch. Another good performance is by Jennifer Garner as a 'model'. The story was good, directly told, and this movie is just an enjoyable two hours you can watch again and again. Really. You'll want to watch it again and again. I give it a 10/10.",10,1,2,31 May 2004
Unbreakable," Shymalan impresses again....
","Over the past few years, a new name has entered the forefont of science fiction: M. Night Shymalan. His powerhouse ghost drama The Sixth Sense, with it's now-legendary twist ending, was an impressive thriller that made me nervous right from the opening credits. Now we have Unbreakable, a slow and deliberately paced mystery that manages to be one of the best 'superhero' films I've ever seen.The thing with this movie is that it understands comic books. It understands the fans and their obsessions, and it understands the mythology behind superheroes. Bruce Willis is once again the everyman, and he shows he is not just an action actor. There's real drama here, and Willis plays it really well. Even more impressive is Samuel L. Jackson, who, over the years, has gained a reputation as the 'big and bad black dude'. Here, he's restrained. He's quiet, he doesn't raise his voice, and he doesn't curse much. It's a remarkable performance from this normally fiery actor. Robin Wright Penn combines the right mix of love and exasperation as Bruce Willis's wife, and Spencer Treat Clark, as their son, is another kid actor that Hollywood needs to look out for.Many people don't like the ending to this movie, but you know what? I thought it was appropriate, and it actually shocked me. Shymalan is like Stephen King; he finds unease in everyday objects. Unbreakable is an impressive feat.",10,7,15,10 August 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Enormously entertaining...
","The long-awaited film version of C.S. Lewis's 'The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' has arrived, and I'm largely impressed. The material has become more nuanced and compelling in it's transition from book to film, the action is very good, and Narnia is perfectly realized. The film, while enormously entertaining, is not perfect.One of the main problems with the film is the spotty direction of the child actors. Georgie Henley is magnificent as Lucy, and Skandar Keynes brings some depth to Edmund (watch his face harden when he tells the others, 'I've seen what the Witch can do.'). Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell), alas, do not fare as well; they are stiff, awkward, and wooden compared to their siblings. Fortunately, this is only a minor problem.What I'm really impressed by are the inhabitants of Narnia. Aslan (voiced terrifically by Liam Neeson) looks great, as do the Beavers, the Fox (Rupert Everett), and the assorted animals and fantasy creature. But especially the Beavers. They add greatly to the enjoyment of the film, and Ray Winstone and Dawn French are clearly having fun as the voices. Tilda Swinton is awesome as the White Witch, and she relishes getting a chance to play a figure of pure evil.Director Andrew Adamson (both the 'Shrek' films) handles all this material nicely, even if the kids get a little annoying once in a while. 'Narnia' is no 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'; it's clearly intended for family audiences. This doesn't hurt the film, though, and it's a highly enjoyable fantasy adventure.",8,3,6,10 December 2005
Spider-Man 2," The best movie so far this year
","I mean it. 'Spider-Man 2' truly IS the best movie of the year so far. Now, that may change when Oscar noms come around, but right now I'm sticking to my opinion. This film has splendid acting, awesome special effects, and Spidey finally gets the girl at the end. What could be better? I usually don't give plot summaries in my reviews, so you won't find one here. As he proved in the original 'Spider-Man', Tobey Maguire is perfect for the dual role of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst, one of the best actresses currently working, is also very good as Mary-Jane, the girl who Peter is hopelessly in love with. Alfred Molina makes a great Doc Ock, but the curious thing is, he redeems himself at the end. Overall, this movie is GREAT. Spidey fans and movie-goers alike won't be disappointed. A 10/10",10,0,1,5 July 2004
The Fifth Element," Oh... so much fun.
","'The Fifth Element' is fun. That is the mindset one must get into to enjoy this movie, and if you're not, you will hate it. Personally, I didn't know what to expect. The critics were mixed on it, it flopped at the box-office, but sci-fi fans (among them Harry Knowles) revere it. I was blown away by the sheer entertainment value of this movie.The story is basic sci-fi mumbo jumbo, but who cares? Anytime you get Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman in the same movie, I couldn't care less about the plot. Bruce Willis once again does his tough-guy persona, and he shows that he's still got the goods to kick butt and crack jokes. Gary Oldman, in a strange idea, has a Texas drawl and he gives another over-the-top bad guy performance (he also has the worst hairstyle known to man). Ian Holm exudes dignity, Chris Tucker is annoying and funny at the same time (scary), and Milla Jovovich kicks even more butt.The action ROCKS. I have not seen shootouts this cool in a long time. The movie is cool, has a strange and colorful 'look' to it, and it's just a blast.",10,5,9,27 August 2005
That Thing You Do!," This is a pretty good movie
","Tom Hanks makes an impressive writing-and-directorial debut with 'That Thing You Do!', a musical comedy/drama set in the 60's about a one-hit wonder band called, appropriately, The Wonders. Tom Hanks is also in the movie, as Mr. White, the manager of the band. Overall, this is light-hearted, peppy, upbeat, and humorous. Hanks does here what he does best: comedy/drama. Hanks' wife, Rita Wilson, makes a small cameo in the film. The acting is solid, the title song is great, and the script is good. Tom Everett Scott plays the main character, Guy Patterson, the drummer of the band. Liv Tyler, pre-Lord of the Rings, is also good here. And Steve Zahn is very good at being a dummy. Overall, this is a good movie.",10,1,1,17 June 2004
Blade II," Blood-drenched action flick that delivers the goods
","'Blade II' is a blast, an atmospheric horror-action thrill ride from director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth). Filling his canvas with sticky surfaces, gold hues and tones, and blood as only del Toro can do blood, 'Blade II' is simultaneously exciting and gross.Long story short: Blade (Wesley Snipes) must join forces with the Vampire Nation to eliminate a new breed of vampires called Reapers. Reapers feed on both humans AND vampires, so it's bad news for both sides. Made leader of a team previously trained to hunt him (which includes amongst its members Ron Perlman and Donnie Yen), Blade finds himself in some very deep trouble as he discovers that there is more than meets the eye to the Reapers.The Reapers are one of the best parts of Blade II. Armed with Predator-esquire jaws and an incredibly disgusting tongue, they are quite possibly the grossest antagonists in recent memory. They are also very persistent, occasionally resembling the creatures from the Alien series. There is an autopsy on a fallen Reaper that is both fascinating and repulsive; I would suggest not eating before watching this scene.del Toro does a fine job with the action scenes; wisely utilizing the terror of the Reapers as a starting point, the only downsides to the action are the occasionally really fake-looking CGI stunt men (especially in the vampire-ninja fight). The smack downs between Blade and Nomak (Luke Goss), the original Reaper, are wonderfully over-the-top and cartoony.Blade II is just loads of fun, even more so than the first movie. Just remember not to eat before watching.",8,0,1,24 July 2007
Lilo & Stitch," A greatly satisfying Disney comedy....
","'Lilo & Stitch' is truly one of the oddest Disney films you will ever see. It all started with the gut-busting ad campaign: The titular monster Stitch showing up in classic Disney movies and genuinely wreaking havoc in them. This offbeat charm shows up in the movie, and 'Lilo & Stitch' is Disney's strongest animated offering in years.The story: Experiment 626 (voice of writer-director Chris Sanders) is a highly dangerous, highly disgusting, highly... tiny illegal alien experiment. He escapes a Galactic Prison and lands on Earth where he is mistaken for a very strange dog and adopted by a odd little Hawaiian girl named Lilo (voice of Daveigh Chase). Lilo is what you'd call a misfit; she listens to Elvis, makes strange dolls, and believes that a fish named Pudge controls the weather. When these two meet, trouble is sure to come. You see, Stitch has a highly aggressive nature, but sweet little Lilo tempers him, and the certified Disney happy-ending comes into play. After, of course, several movie references, lots of slapstick and verbal comedy, and tons of space action.What really endears one to 'Lilo & Stitch' is it's highly quirky characters. Lilo is one of the few 6 year-olds who listens to Elvis, and Stitch has a high-pitched laugh that evokes movies like 'Gremlins' and 'Critters'. Another true joy of the movie is it's supporting cast. Nani is Lilo's big sister, voiced by Tia Carrere, and a surrogate mom (their parents died). She's not perfect, though, and is constantly at risk at having Lilo taken away from her by Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames), a disapproving social worker. Let's talk about him for a moment. In another movie, Bubbles would be the villain (and ostensibly he is), but here he's more realistic. When he tells Nani that Lilo has to be taken away, there is true sadness in his animated eyes. And then of course there's the bumbling duo of Jumba and Pleakley. Jumba (David Ogden Stiers) is the self-described 'evil genius' who created Stitch with a Russian accent, and Pleakley (Kevin McDonald) is an alien officer who is an 'expert' on Earth. He believes that mosquitoes are the dominant life form on Earth (this is another odd character quirk).'Lilo & Stitch' is an odd, skewed but hilarious Disney animated offering that is sure to entertain the whole family. Also, Disney gains a new animated hero in Stitch. You just can't help but like the little monster.",10,5,6,17 August 2005
Ocean's Eleven," A fun caper from Steven Soderbergh
","This is my first Steven Soderbergh film, and from judging by this, I'd say he's a pretty good filmmaker. The cast for this movie is wonderful: you've got the coolest actor in Hollywood George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner and Don Cheadle, among others. They are all wonderful in their roles. The script is snappy, slick, and very good dialogue. I love the speech to George Clooney gives to Brad Pitt, who then asks, 'You've been practicing this speech, haven't you?'. Also, the heist itself is brilliant. These guys, as Elliot Gould's character puts it, are nuts. But they pull it off. Overall, 'Ocean's Eleven' is a fun, entertaining, and just slick caper movie. I give it a 10/10.",10,0,0,2 July 2004
Meet the Fockers," Ben Stiller's back again...
","Although I have not seen 'Meet the Parents' (2000), I liked 'Meet the Fockers' a lot more than I thought.The story: Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (Ben Stiller) is getting married to Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). He met her parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) last time around, so now it's time to meet Greg's parents, the Fockers.It's safe to say that the Fockers differ from the Byrnes: Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) is a retired lawyer who has put up a 'Wall of Gaylord' that displays many awards Greg won as a kid; however, they're mostly for last place. Roz (Barbra Streisand), on the other hand, is a sex therapist for senior citizens and has a whole room full of sex-related art. Needless to say, personalities clash, old secrets are revealed, and hilarity ensues.I've always had a liking for Ben Stiller, even in some of his less-than-inspired projects, and he's great here, particularly in a drug-induced monologue late in the film. Robert De Niro plays his role as straight as he possibly can to all the weirdness going on around him. Hoffman is the complete opposite of De Niro, and the two veterans have some great scenes together. I enjoyed Streisand's performance (her profession is funnier than it sounds), and the rest of the cast does a good job keeping up with this manic fun.I laughed so hard during this movie I thought I was going to die of laughter. That thankfully didn't happen, but I still fully recommend 'Meet the Fockers'. 10/10.",10,0,1,21 February 2005
The Transporter," Pure warpspeed action
","'The Transporter' is a big, loud, dumb action movie that manages to be wonderously entertaining largely due to it's leading man, Jason Statham. Statham is very charismatic, and watching him kick major amounts of a$$ is so much fun.From the opening car chase to the explosive finale, 'The Transporter' is filled with cleverly staged action. It also includes one of the funniest battle scenes I've ever seen: Frank (Statham) is fighting off a bunch of bad guys in a pool of oil in a parking garage. As you can probably guess, he uses the slickness of the oil to his advantage. This scene has the distinction of something I've never seen before in a movie.If you like big popcorn movies like 'Tomb Raider' or 'XxX', 'The Transporter' is the movie for you.",10,1,2,28 June 2005
Ghost Rider," 'Ghost Rider' is goofy and fun, primarily because of Nicolas Cage's performance...
","Nicolas Cage loves comics. Taking the surname 'Cage' from a black Marvel superhero named Luke Cage, naming his son Kal-El (Superman's Kryptonian name), and he was cast as Superman in the ill-fated mid-90s Tim Burton project 'Superman Lives'. Now, I like Cage; he is a splendid, bizarre actor who takes chances and risks, but I simply don't see him as Superman. Now he has a film where he is more suited to playing the lead: Ghost Rider.Based on the Marvel comic, Ghost Rider tells the story of Johnny Blaze (Cage), a motorcycle daredevil who sells his soul to Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) in order to cure his father's cancer. His father then dies in a stunt accident. Bummer. Many years later, Mephisto comes to collect on the deal and turns Blaze into the Ghost Rider, a kind of bounty hunter who throws escaped souls back into Hell. His son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) has escaped from down below, looking for a contract made with 1000 evil souls. Blaze enlists the help of the Caretaker (Sam Elliott) to aid him in his fight, and things proceed in a predictable if enjoyable fashion.The best parts of the movie are Cage and Elliott. Cage brings a weirdness to Blaze that makes him more human. Rather than being a hard-drinking, chain-smoking mope, Cage dines on jellybean martinis, listens to the Carpenters, and watches monkey shows. And I could frankly watch Elliott be a cowboy all day. While he's saddled with some pretty bad lines, Elliott forms a nice repartee with Cage.The supporting cast, alas, does not fare as well. Peter Fonda manages to escape embarrassment by going for a quieter type of menace, but Eva Mendes is not given anything to do as the love interest except look great, and Wes Bentley is just horrible. Now, I like over-the-top villains, but Bentley doesn't bring any menace or energy to the role. His henchmen are equally lame, and they are hopelessly unimposing compared to the Ghost Rider.Speaking of which, the Rider is pretty cool. A flaming skeleton clad in leather and chains is a pretty cool image to begin with, and the effects involving him and his ultra-chrome Hellcycle are neat, if not photo real. I liked when the Rider is played as more a movie monster than a superhero, such as in a scene where Blaze is thrown in prison and things go south quickly.Director Mark Steven Johnson (the unfairly maligned 'Daredevil') has a nice visual style, and the western elements he brings to the fray help liven things up a bit, but he simply should not be allowed to write anymore screenplays. The script here is saddled with horrible lines like 'He may have my soul, but he doesn't have my spirit', 'Hey, Dirtbag!' and 'Let's clear the air!'.Despite these problems, 'Ghost Rider' is entertaining for its running length, and Cage's enthusiasm is infectious. You could do worse.",7,3,5,6 July 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," While it definitely needs some improvement, 'The Last Stand' is a fitting and enjoyable end to the 'X-Men' film series.
","The amount of trouble, ill will, and internet fanboy ranting that has followed the production of the 3rd X-Men movie could probably fill an entire book. Director Brett Ratner ('Rush Hour') has been cast as a villain right from the start, but I'm glad to say 'X-Men: The Last Stand' is not the disaster anticipated by the aforementioned internet ranting. That being said, it definitely needs some improvement, but it's not a bad film.Right from the start, Ratner makes it clear he's putting his stamp on the franchise. The final X-Men movie lacks the precision and nuance that Singer brought to the series, and some of the 'drama' in 'Last Stand' has the subtlety of a kick to the groin, notably the whole 'nothing's wrong with us' gay subtext. This doesn't destroy the film, but I wish Ratner hadn't rushed so much to get the film cracking. And boy, does it get cracking.When the movie finally kicks into overdrive, the results are magnificent. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) stabs people, Beast (a magnificent Kelsey Grammar) flips around like a monkey, Storm (Halle Berry) fries people with lightning bolts, and Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) smashes through walls. This is what I paid for. One problem, though: There are simply too many characters. A *lot* of new characters are introduced in this movie, and too many of them get not enough to do. My mind boggles at what the movie could do with characters like Angel (Ben Foster), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), and Multiple Man (Eric Dane). Instead, we get far too much of lame people like Callisto (Dania Ramirez), and her brood of punk mutants. Huh? What's up with these guys? They're lamer than Toad from the first movie! Despite these complaints, 'The Last Stand' is still darn enjoyable, and it makes up for its lack of subtlety in drama with its lack of subtlety in ACTION.",8,0,0,4 June 2006
Hellboy," This movie was awesome!
","I just saw this, and man, it was good! Hellboy is cool to the core. Ron Perlman makes a very good Hellboy. In practically every scene, he looks like he's having fun in that makeup. The other actors are good too; John Hurt, Selma Blair, Rupert Evans, and Jeffrey Tambor. The action was superb. The special effects were neat too. Especially the makeup and creature effects. All in all, this is 2 hours of solid film. Good acting, a sharp script, and awesome effects. I do have one question. Why couldn't we have seen more of Abe-Sapien? He was a cool character. Well, I can't wait for the sequel. Here's hoping there even is a sequel to this wonderful movie. All in all, four stars!",10,0,0,23 April 2004
The Incredibles," A bold new step in direction for Pixar.
","'The Incredibles' is the best animated action-adventure ever made. Combining wry satirical humor, politics, domestic drama, and those blistering action sequences, this movie is Disney/Pixar's best film since the original 'Toy Story'.The story centers around Mr. Incredible (voice of Craig T. Nelson), a superhero who, in his prime, was a man you could always count on. But 15 years ago, everything changed. After Mr. Incredible intercepted a suicide jumper, the jumper filed a lawsuit against him and the public's view of superheroes gradually began to change. Finally, under immense pressure from lawsuits and other issues, the government launched the 'Superhero Relocation Program': In exchange for having the slate wiped clean, the Supers (as they're called) agreed to never use their powers in heroic acts again and essentially become normal. Flash-forward to now: Mr. Incredible is now Bob Parr, an insurance agent married to former Super Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter), now known as Helen, and three kids: Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), a teenager who can turn invisible and generate force fields; Dash (voice of Spencer Fox), a 10 year-old who does everything super-fast; and Jack-Jack, the baby and the only 'normal' person in the family. Bob misses the old life, and when a mysterious person calls him back into action, he jumps at the chance. He may get more than he bargained for, though, when it turns out to be a trap set by an enemy with an intriguing grudge, and now Bob's family must save him.Director Brad Bird (he of the underrated 1999 film 'The Iron Giant') is a newbie to Pixar, but that doesn't stop him from creating a modern animated masterpiece. Pixar's animation is much cooler than that of DreamWorks or other CGI studios, and they're the first people to get action in cartoons right in a long, long time. The story is great, highly original, and it's got one of the best animated villains in history: Syndrome (voice of Jason Lee), a former fan who has now turned to the dark side and wants to destroy his once-upon-a-time idol. Syndrome is *really* evil (he coldly disregards the lives of Bob's family), and not a bumbling fool like so many other cartoon bad guys. All the vocal performances are spot-on, and they include Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone, an old superhero friend of Bob's (he can freeze stuff), and Bird as Edna Mode, a fashion designer for superheroes. 'E', as she is called, is a hilarious character, and I hope to see more of her in the eventual sequel.'The Incredibles' is classic, and it's a bold new step in direction for Pixar.",10,0,0,1 May 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A cinematic treat...
","Tim Burton is back in town with 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', a delightful new adaptation of the classic Road Dahl book. It's got everything you'd expect from a Tim Burton movie: Danny Elfman score, bizarre humor, wonderful production design, and another weird performance from Burton favorite Johnny Depp. Depp is Willy Wonka in one of the most original performances of the year.Everyone knows the plot: Little Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is one of five kids who get to visit Willy Wonka's amazing chocolate factory. Charlie is a good boy, but the other four children are selfish and greedy. At the end of the day, four children have been punished, and Charlie is rewarded.Johnny Depp is one of the best actors working today, and his strange performance as Willy Wonka proves it. His Wonka is germophobic, utters 60's catchphrases, and doesn't like parents. Truth be told, it's a better performance than Gene Wilder. The added subplot about Wonka's childhood and his stern dentist father (Christopher Lee) adds some interest, and it doesn't slow things down. Freddie Highmore, who was last seen with Depp in 'Finding Neverland', is great as Charlie, and I can't think of anyone else in the role. Special mention must also go to David Kelly, who infuses Charlie's Grandpa Joe with charm and enthusiasm.The production is a beautiful one, and it showcases Burton's affinity for the bizarre. The special effects are impressive, too, and they're not bogged down with too much CGI. Danny Elfman's score is his best in years, and I found myself more than once humming along to the theme.It is said that Roald Dahl hated the original 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. However, were he alive today, I think he would have liked this wonderful adaptation. It got the seal of approval from his family, after all. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is a terrific film.",10,6,11,27 July 2005
Mission: Impossible II," Lame James Bond rip-off.
","I really liked 1996's 'Mission: Impossible'. Now here is the antithesis of the first movie: 'Mission: Impossible II'. The first film was a tight, smooth thriller that barreled along at warp speed, and was a nice break from conventional Hollywood action thrillers. 'II' pretty much IS a conventional Hollywood thriller.Almost nothing from the first film has been picked up here: Tom Cruise? Yes, he's back, but he's not a spy anymore. He's James Bond, minus ANY cool gadgets or charisma. The awesome theme music? Gone, replaced with a horrible rock score. The action is typical Hollywood: Slow-motion gunplay and martial arts.Ugh, I hate this movie! The acting and dialogue is lame, the techno-rock score even lamer, and the action scenes are mundane. Here's hoping 'MI: III' won't be as cringe-inducing as this disaster.",1,62,101,11 December 2005
Big Fish," Tim Burton creates another masterpiece
","'Big Fish' is a lush and beautiful fantasy from director Tim Burton, and it's one of his best films. Granted, I'm predisposed to like a Tim Burton movie (heck, I even liked 'Planet of the Apes'), but you can't deny that this is a great film.Edward Bloom (Albert Finney as an old man, Ewan McGregor as a young man) is at the end of his life. His son, Will, is tired of hearing the tall tales his father has told so many times over the years, and now Will wants 'the truth'. But, as Will learns, sometimes fantasy is more interesting than reality.The acting is really wonderful in this movie. Albert Finney is, of course, a blowhard, but he's so full of life you just can't help but like him. Ewan McGregor slips into a Southern accent and gives a better performance than in any of the 'Star Wars' prequels. Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange both play Sandra, Edward's loving wife who understands that, yes, he is a storyteller, but she still loves him. And how about the supporting actors? You've got Danny DeVito as a circus ringleader with a secret, Steve Buscemi as a poet who robs a bankrupt bank, and Matthew McGrory as the gentle giant Karl.The movie delights in it's odd characters and situations, and Tim Burton clearly loves the fantastic. The story is unexpectedly heartwarming, and I didn't think Burton could make something this benign (not a bad quality, you understand). All of this adds up to the genuinely moving conclusion, which nearly had me in tears. 'Big Fish' is a terrific film.",10,0,0,29 July 2005
Men in Black," One of the best sci-fi comedies ever made.
","As my one line summary says, this is one of the best sci-fi comedies ever made, next to the classic Ghostbusters and the highly underrated Evolution. This movie has action, comedy, and some of the best special effects in the last ten years. Rick Baker, Hollywood's resident 'creature man', as I like to call him, has made such a wide variety of aliens. There's the first alien we see, Mikey; there's the Worm Guys; and the villanous Bug. But there are many others, such as Frank the Pug and the twins. The squid baby is pretty neat. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith have an undeniable chemistry together, which repeats itself in the sequel. Linda Fiorentino is also good as the leading lady, and veteran actor Rip Torn is gruff as the head of MIB, Zed. Vincent D'Onofrio is also pretty good. My favorite line: 'No, ma'am. We at the FBI do not have a sense of humor that we are aware of.' All in all, two thumbs up, baby!",Null,78,96,22 April 2004
Hitch," Thank you, Will Smith and Kevin James, for making a romantic comedy that didn't make me want to scratch my eyes out afterwards....
","'Hitch' is a nice surprise: A romantic comedy that actually has romance and comedy. Most romantic comedies for me range from mediocre to horrible because they are not funny or romantic. 'Hitch' takes actors like Will Smith, Kevin James, and Eva Mendes into a fun, light-as-a-feather journey that actually had me laughing and, yes, a little 'aww, how sweet!'.Meet Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), aka Hitch. He's a self-proclaimed 'Date Doctor'; he helps hopeless guys like Albert (Kevin James) win guys like Allegra (Amber Valletta). Unfortunately, Hitch has to deal with Sarah (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist bent on breaking the Date Doctor...'Hitch' is actually pretty funny, and it even makes the standard slapstick scenes work simply because the cast is so energetic and clearly having fun. I have to wonder why Will Smith hasn't made more movies like this. His sharp, rapid-fire delivery is perfect for this genre, and his chemistry with Mendes and James is wonderful. James is a real discovery; I have never seen his show 'The King of Queens', but he is funny and heartfelt, and he proves once more that fat white men cannot dance hip-hop (Smith's responses to his attempts are hilarious). Mendes is hot and bouncy (not that way, geez) as Smith's perfect match, and Amber Valletta is sweet as Allegra.'Hitch' isn't perfect; it's a tad too long, and things get too 'dramatic' near the end (although this is redeemed by the happy ending filled with funny dancing). But's it a great refresher from the cookie-cutter romantic comedies that keep littering theaters.",8,0,0,30 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas, you have done well... sort of.
","I'm sorry, I just can't give this movie a perfect score. That being said, 'Star Wars: Episode III-Revenge of the Sith' is an explosive finale to the beloved saga that all of us grew up with.I have some problems with this movie, and here they are: The dialogue still sucks. It just does. Whether it be romantic, political, or just plain conversation, it still SUCKS. Big time. Also, the acting is rather clunky, most especially Hayden Christensen. I mean, come on: 'Oh, I don't get to be a Jedi Master, WAAA!' That's basically what he sounds like. He doesn't sound like a man in torment with his personal demons. He sounds like a teenager who doesn't get to drive his dad's car. Boo-hoo. I wasn't moved an bit by Anakin's predicament.All right, now that we've got my issues out of the way, this movie looks, sounds, and feels GREAT! The visual effects and action sequences are stupendous and they're much more exciting than the previous two prequels. ILM has done some truly terrific work here.The story also ties in nicely with A New Hope. We see the gradual 'dirtying' of the galaxy, the Death Star is being built, and everything happens that Star Wars fans have been waiting to see.All this is great stuff, but I just... I just can't give this film a perfect rating. I liked the film a good bit, though I wanted desperately to love it.",8,1,4,10 July 2005
The Lion King," Why didn't this get an Oscar?
","First off, this should have been nominated (and won) for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. But guess who won instead? Forrest Gump. Granted, Forrest Gump is a good movie. The Lion King was much better. Anyway, back to the review. This movie is the BEST Disney Animated movie ever. Everything, every minute, in this movie is perfect, from the opening 'Circle of Life' to the end of the movie when Rafiki holds Simba and Nala's cub up. The voice talents are the best I've seen in years, from James Earl Jones (still the one and only Darth Vader) as Mufasa, Matthew Broderick as Adult Simba, and others (like Jeremy Irons, for instance). The art and visuals are beautiful, and the songs rule. In my book, this is a 10/10 and a milestone in Disney's wonderful history.",Null,0,0,21 October 2003
Space Jam," Not terrible, just... underwhelming
","It's really hard to comment on a movie like 'Space Jam'. Most people trash it because it is untrue to the tradition of Looney Tunes. I agree with this; I groan at the inclusion of Lola Bunny, and Bugs and costars would NOT need Michael Jordan's help in defeating these Monstars. The only thing that can kill them is Dip, for crying out loud. Nevertheless, the film has it's charms (though they are few). One cannot review 'Space Jam' without mentioning Michael Jordan. I wouldn't mind the movie so much if it didn't center around Jordan worship. Here's an idea: Why not have a real actor play a fictional basketball player? A legend out of their prime, called out again in a time of need for the Looney Tunes. Doesn't that seem like a good premise? Apparently, Warner Bros. didn't think so, and much of the film has gallons of praise for Jordan. Michael Jordan is not a bad actor per se, but he really is just being himself. The Looney Tunes are still funny, but their personalities do not seem as apparent in this movie. I mean, when you get down to it, the personalities of the Looney Tunes is what makes them funny. Here, they just seem... like cookie-cutter cartoon characters. That ain't good. Bill Murray shows up to inject some much-needed laughs in the final act, and he seems more adept at acting alongside 'Toons than Michael Jordan. Ultimately, Space Jam's problem is that it falls flat. It's dead in the water. 'Space Jam' is a disappointment.",4,1,9,24 May 2005
Speed," Enjoyable action ride...
","'Speed' is a highly entertaining thriller made with loads of energy and style. It has a great cast, taut direction, and enjoyably outrageous stunts.LA cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) is a busy guy. Not long after foiling a hostage situation involving former Atlanta cop Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) and an elevator full of victims, Jack is pulled into Payne's new scheme, the now-famous 'bomb-on-a-bus' situation. After the driver is accidentally shot by one of the passengers, a woman named Annie (Sandra Bullock) takes over and must work with Jack to figure a way out.I have never thought Keanu Reeves is a bad actor; he's just a limited one. The problem with Reeves is that he is frequently miscast in romances when he's more at home in action flicks like this or 'The Matrix' or comedies like 'Bill and Ted'. Reeves is terrific here, focused and tough, although his delivery does occasionally mangle some good lines. I liked Reeves' and Bullock's chemistry, although the screenplay's attempts to make them fall in love are VERY forced. Hopper plays another one of his patented psychos spectacularly, while Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton play Jack's fellow cops. I also liked Alan Ruck (Cameron from 'Ferris Buller') as a nervous bus passenger who gets a great moment early on.The direction by Jan de Bont is relentless, only briefly stopping to let the audience catch their breath. The script is good too; as soon as one problem is solved, another surfaces, and you can't help but grin when Jack actually lowers himself under the bus to try and defuse the bomb.'Speed' may not be a classic, but it's still loads of fun.",8,0,0,11 July 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," 'Live Free or Die Hard' provides excellent thrills and laughs in a summer of disappointing, bloated blockbusters...
","Comparing the new film 'Live Free or Die Hard' to the 1988 classic 'Die Hard' seems kind of pointless to me (I have yet to see 'Die Hard 2: Die Harder' or 'Die Hard With A Vengeance). They are two films born of different eras, each with their own goals in mind. 'Die Hard' is obviously a classic, but LFODH does a great job of providing the goods for an entertaining summer action flick.The plot, such as it is: Former US hacker Thomas Gabriel (an unimposing Timothy Olyphant) decides to bring down the computer system of America and cause chaos. It's up to New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) and geeky hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) to stop Gabriel's plan, especially considering that the baddies get hold of John's daughter Lucy (a feisty Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Much gunfire, explosions, and fistfights ensue.One of the things I liked about the movie is that McClane and Farrell truly need each other. McClane is behind the times, described at one point as 'a Timex watch in a digital world', while Farrell is insanely up-to-date. McClane provides fisticuffs, Farrell supplies hacker skills. I liked their budding friendship, and Farrell has a surprisingly effective character arc as he grows a backbone; one of the best scenes in the film has him refusing to help Gabriel complete his plans. Long is a funny actor, and he has a good rapport with Willis, who proves once again that he came out of the womb in order to play this character. Winstead makes a fine McClane-in-training, although her first scene is a little creepy thanks to the script.The bad guys, alas, do not fear as well. While I suppose Olyphant is fine doing malevolent stares and speaking in a half-menacing whisper, he doesn't really prove to be much a challenge for McClane. His two best scenes come in a confrontation with McClane over a web cam and when he sighs to Lucy, 'I can't talk to him, *you* talk to him,' like a disappointed parent. Maggie Q has a great fight scene with Willis, and parkour expert Cyrus Rafaelli has some cool scenes, and his death is kind of magnificent.Director Len Wiseman (the 'Underworld' series) does a fine job with the action scenes, although even I have to admit that the business with the fighter jet seems superfluous. What he's not so good at is tension and danger, save for the opening apartment battle and McClane and Farrell's infiltration of one of Gabriel's targets.The PG-13 rating does not dampen the experience too much. Yes, it'd be nice to hear McClane drop f-bombs by the dozens, but at least he gets to say his most famous line (albeit slightly muffled). Strangely, I didn't notice the supposed dubbing errors that many critics have pointed out; maybe I'm just not good at that sort of thing. The violence pushes the rating about as far as it go, and it's satisfyingly brutal.'Live Free or Die Hard' is stalwartly old-fashioned. Like it's hero, it's a throwback to simpler times, a breath of fresh air in a season of bloated CGI extravaganzas (although I am still looking forward to Transformers, which looks to combine new-school effects with old-school sensibilities).",8,3,6,2 July 2007
X2: X-Men United," The rare sequel that is better than the original...
","Sequels are simultaneously the joy and the banality of Hollywood. They're fun because we see favorite characters again, and they're banal because all too often they repeat their predecessor. 'X2' is an improvement over the already good 'X-Men', and it's a great comic-book film.I prefer to leave plot details to writers, so let's get down to the cast. Hugh Jackman, I don't care what you say about his other movies, IS Wolverine. Every time I read the comic book now, I hear his voice. He's intense, animalistic, brutish, but he also has a sweeter side that too many action heroes don't have. Jackman pulls all of this off spectacularly, and I love him in this role. James Marsden is criminally underused, but he's not bad. Famke Janssen is oh-so-lovely as Jean Grey, and Halle Berry does a nice job as Storm. I liked Rogue (Anna Paquin), and her relationship with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) is all the more heartbreaking because it's not forbidden love, it's a love that can never blossom. Patrick Stewart radiates authority as Xavier, as does Ian McKellen as Magneto. Rebecca Romijin-Stamos is sexy as Mystique, and I liked her 'real' cameo (you'll know it when you see her).My favorite characters are the new ones: Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), a blue-skinned German teleporter who is deeply religious. Cumming pulls off the humor and pathos of his character well, and he has some nice scenes with Halle Berry. Kelly Hu does the silent killer thing as Lady Deathstrike. She, like Wolverine, has an adamantium skeleton and she has claws that come out of her fingernails. Wolverine's response? 'Holy sh**!' That throwdown is a film highlight. Brian Cox is the villain of the piece, William Stryker, a man who wants revenge on all mutants. Cox exudes evil here, and he adds another fantastic notch to his belt. I also liked Aaron Stanford as Pyro, and I want to see more of him in the next movie.The special effects are bigger and badder this time around, and director Bryan Singer actually makes CGI look cool. The script gives everyone their moments in the sun, and the acting is great. 'X2' is yet another film in the steadily increasing line of great comic book movies.",10,3,6,19 July 2005
The Matrix," Slightly overrated, but still a good film
","'The Matrix' is a hodgepodge of intriguing science fiction and comic-book violence, and although I feel it's overrated (I've heard 1998's 'Dark City' is a similar yet better movie), I still had a good time.The special effects in this movie are, without a doubt, some of the best I've ever seen. We get the now-famous 'Bullet Time' where Neo (Keanu Reeves) dodges oncoming bullets; we get mechanical octopi taking on hovercrafts; we get the swirling fight choreography and slo-mo techniques. All very impressive.The story is illogical, but it does introduce intriguing suggestions about the difference between reality and dreams; I think we have to take the 'machines-rule-mankind' aspect on faith.The acting: Keanu Reeves is good in an uncomplicated role and he looks right for the character, Laurence Fishburne successfully acts this material as if it was Shakespeare, Joe Pantoliano is perfectly slimy as a traitor, Hugo Weaving is one of the best movie villains ever as the sinister Agent Smith, and the sexy Carrie Ann-Moss is Trinity, Neo's (eventual) love interest.Overall, while I don't think this is one of the best movies ever made, it's still a great movie. 9/10",9,0,1,5 April 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away...
","(Cue Star Wars Theme) Where to begin? This is not only one of the best movies of all time, not only (still) one of the most visual films ever made, but this is the movie that drew me back to the movie theater. The acting is strong, the script is somewhat weak but still good, and the effects are just plain AWESOME. Every generation needs to see this and The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

Princess Mononoke," 'Why are you here?' 'To see with eyes unclouded by hate.'
","'Princess Mononoke' is, quite frankly, one of the greatest animated films of all time. It's a classic, filled with terrific, eye-popping imagery, complex characters, and it is truly powerful in its dramatic impact. I came close to tears by the film's end.The first thing you will notice about 'Mononoke' is the animation. Animation god Hayao Miyazaki fills his screen with lush colors and bizarre fantasy creatures (personal favorite: Ashitaka's deer/horse steed Yakul). It's a far cry from the increasingly cheap animation we have in America. The movie is ambitious in its scale, and there are some truly magnificent set-pieces, like the near-apocalyptic ending.Also of particular note is the story. These characters and this plot are not black-and-white. Lady Eboshi may be cutting down the forests and angering the gods, but she truly believes it will help her people; she shows compassion to outsiders like lepers and prostitutes, and her regret at Ashitaka's cursed arm is sincere (she did, after all, cause the boar god's madness). San, the 'Princess Mononoke' of the title, has shades of gray, too: Yes, we sympathize with her desire to protect the forest, but she is not innocent of bloodshed. Even Jigo, a con man/priest who wants the Forest Spirit's head for the Emperor (which is obviously a bad idea), has his reasons for committing what may be considered 'evil'.The English voice cast has divided people, but I liked it. Billy Crudup brings gravity and stoicism to Ashitaka, and Claire Danes is appropriately fierce as San. The standouts, however, lie in the supporting cast. Minnie Driver is perfect as Eboshi, bringing wit and elegance to the role; Gillian Anderson breaks from her Scully persona to deliver a powerful performance as ancient wolf god Moro; Keith David, one of America's most underrated actors, rules as the boar god Okkoto, and Billy Bob Thornton is very funny as Jigo. Thornton's Southern drawl has caused controversy amongst fans, but I think it adds to the character's charm.'Princess Mononoke' is a masterpiece. To find a flaw in this movie is impossible.",10,6,10,15 October 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A little weird, but a lot of fun
","The Coen brothers team is one of the best story-tellers in the movie business to date. I loved 'The Hudsucker Proxy', and 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is another movie from that type. George Clooney, whom I have disliked ever since his hambone Batman portrayal in 'Batman and Robin', redeems himself here, as the fast-talking hero. His sidekicks, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, are also very good. I love Delmar (Nelson) and Pete's (Turturro) exchange in the movie theater. Also, the scene with the cows is hysterical. The best scene, however, is the scene where the trio discovers a Klu Klux Klan meeting. The scene is an obscure 'Wizard of Oz' reference. All in all, this movie's a little weird, but a whole lot of fun. Check it out.",Null,0,1,16 June 2004
