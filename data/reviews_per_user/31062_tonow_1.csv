Deja Vu," typical T. Scott - no depth whatsoever
","I think the makers of this movie couldn't decide whether they wanted to make a science-fiction or some kind of political-fiction film; what would point to the first of the two genres is of course the whole concept of time traveling but unfortunately there is too much effort put into placing this in reality (a reference to energy blackout in Canada, the date is shown on several occasions). The result is that the viewer doesn't believe what he sees and one loses the interest in the whole story - if the science-fiction rules of telling the story had been applied along the way this could have been a good, watchable movie.Denzel has made three films with this director and each one of them is worse than it's predecessor.",3,3,7,3 May 2007
