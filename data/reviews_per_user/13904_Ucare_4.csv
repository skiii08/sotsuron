The Expendables 2," Empty, confused, embarrassingly pretentious.
","So, after watching the first one and finding it stupid but entertaining, I watched this and I just wonder WHY do they need all those famous actors to do a crap like this. This is such a waste of potential. It is just boom boom all the time, no real power, no intensity, no epic, no elegance, no speed, no thrill, no suspense, no nothing. You call this action? This is a meaningless mess! And all those actors together become boring after a while. Instead of multiplying each other their individual strength, they lose intensity because all is just a chaos and none of them has enough space. The storyline is null. The script is childish. The supposed funny lines make not laugh anybody. Why should somebody laugh with Chuck Norris who makes a joke on himself like the ones you can find in Internet, about a Cobra who's beaten him and died in agony? Why should be funny that somebody says to Arnold 'if you do not give it back to me I will terminate your ass'? Because everybody will think about Terminator? This is so POOR, so stupid... Plot has more holes than a Gruyere. Actually plot IS a hole, with some action around. The fights and killings are ridiculous, people are there coming in hordes just to be killed, without the MINIMUM realism. Stallone and the other writers do not understand that what makes an Hero strong are his strong enemies. If a Giant fights against many little powerless creatures and kill them all, nobody is impressed. But if two people of great power fight each other, the fight is memorable! Here you have a lot of 'big' heroes against a brunch of powerless ants. As said, NO INTENSITY. The only bad 'hero' is Van Damme. This is a MISTAKE. It would have been much more interesting to have a corresponding number of equally big villains. 10 big Heroes, ten big villains. Or so. By the way, these supposed heroes look so unimportant in this movie. The ONLY one who brings something interesting to the movie is Jason. Apart for when he must act a funny line, badly written by, hmmm, who wrote this terrible script by the way? So much money and they could not even pay a decent writer? The only good line in the entire movie was the one between Stallone and Arnold at the end: 'that thing is for a museum' 'we all are'. Yes. You are!",4,1,2,3 May 2014
Gravity," 'Well done' and boring. Both true. Both subjective.
","The movie is beyond any doubt well done. Well acted, beautiful images, script and direction are OK. And in ANY movie it is always a matter of tastes. So no review can ever be really objective. So, if you like introspective movies where the action stays in little things, where nothing particular happens, where the acting is everything and where there is not lot of social interaction, and if you liked Solaris, Europa Report, and Moon, then you will enjoy this film. If you are more like me, more for movies where there are many things happening, more than Sandra Bullok's worried face and 'oh no, we are lost' for 90 minutes, then you may find this movie very well acted and quite boring.",6,0,2,9 March 2014
Divergent," FInally an excellent movie!
","I did not read the book but I find the film excellent. Very well acted (particularly the actress who performs Tris is very good.), interesting, caught my attention all the time. That our society must change, is obvious. That until we do not change inside, any form that our society will take will always be unstable because we will destroy all again and again, is also obvious. So I like films like this, which show how a possibly good idea can turn bad if people start repeating the same mistakes we are doing. For me, 8/10.I understand well those who have read the book. But they must understand how difficult it is to put one book in one film.",8,0,2,12 April 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Absolutely the worst X-Men till now.
","Slow, too much boring bla bla (of the bad one, just emotional stereotypes) and way too few action. I do not go to watch X-Men to see cheap Rhetoric, I go to see epic fights, special powers, amazing characters. I was not moved nor excited not even for a second. All what happens is very predictable, the characters are few, and all what happens is about Charles, Magneto, Mystique, and the omnipresent Wolverine. Always them. BORING. Just a few new interesting characters on the future side of the story, which only the connoisseurs can enjoy, because there is absolutely no introduction and their appearance is relegated into few short weak scenes. I think this Movie shows clearly that X-Men became a a sort of TV Series, just in the Cinema. Here the writers sacrificed an entire Movie to the 'development' (=low level stereotypical) of the personality of a couple of characters, cutting away action, epic, speed, diversity, news, etc. Problem is that this is a Movie, not an episode of a TV Series (which you have to wait a week to see the next one), a Movie for which people had to wait years, as they will have to wait before the next. The writers are going in circles. Nowhere.",4,5,14,28 May 2014
