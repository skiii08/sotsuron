The Double Life of Véronique," In the geographers' top ten
","Being a lover of all things geographical I loved this film's sense of place and the significance of location. It's also a moving film (quite dark most of the time) with an excellent soundtrack, and Irene Jacob is super (fragile, determined, sexy) as the hero(es).",9,1,8,23 October 2002
Se7en," Nauseatingly fantastic
","Surely one of the most gripping films I've ever seen, with two marvellous acting performances to boot. It's hard to review this film without using the word 'disgusting'. It is disgusting, like the kind of nightmare you can't tell anyone you had in case they call the police. But somehow it's just so clever and so well done it's possible to admit not only to liking this film, but also that it's a work of genius.",10,0,0,24 January 2004
Memento," Unique
","To conceive this movie and have the dedication to see it through: wonderful. To plot it: straightforward enough. To make it: masterful.So the obviousness of the plot does let this film down a bit, but it's part of the film's genius that a film made by lesser-known actors and technicians about such ordinary people in such an ordinary place can be so gripping.'Lenny!'",10,0,2,8 October 2002
Match Point," Shockingly poor
","About 15 minutes in, my wife and I turned to each other and agreed that this was rubbish. In fact, if it hadn't been a Woody Allen film, we might've stopped watching. The acting is rotten, but given that the script is appallingly bad, they didn't stand a chance. (Brian Cox was good, and Johansson had her moments, but that's about it.) The lines are so cliché-laden, we thought that maybe it was all supposed to be a little tongue-in-cheek, but unfortunately it turns out it was all 'serious'.I was mightily relieved when the film finally achieved some dramatic tension. The plot at this point wasn't original, but it was quite well done, and I almost decided that the film might be worth 5/10 after all. But the denouement is utterly ridiculous - Allen has resorted to remaking one of his own films! Sad. If this is the future level of Allen's film-making, I hope he retires.",4,2,4,28 April 2007
Lost in Translation," Another kind of escapism
","I feel a bit uncomfortable watching films like this. That's because I'm wondering what my fellow moviegoers are making of it. You see, it's not typical Hollywood fare - no action, no jokes, no fairy-tale plot. In fact I'd label it a European movie, even though it was made by Americans in Japan. But even though Coppola makes no concessions I felt that the audience was won over.The best one-word review I can come up with is 'real'. Coppola has gone for realism in a big way. The film is slow-paced with scenes where the characters do and say little, and lots of shots of Tokyo doing the stuff Tokyo does. So the escapism this film provides is only that of being other, normal lives in another, normal place. No surprises, not even at the end. Brave and great.Some people have criticised the film for taking it out on the Japanese, but I don't think there's anything unrealistic about the leading characters' response to their environment. If that response is cruel, well most people's is, unless they're so PC they constantly hide their true emotions behind platitudes. The only criticism I make is that I'm not sure that a doctor would rabbit on in Japanese if they could see that the other person didn't understand.Finally, Murray and Johannson are so good, they deserve to win many awards.",9,0,1,24 January 2004
Groundhog Day," Flawless Fun
","This is what cinema was invented for!  A very clever use of the medium, a very funny script, a brilliant comic actor (Bill Murray), a dash of sentimentality, result: fantastic.",10,0,0,7 February 1999
Groundhog Day," Still makes me smile.
","This is a fine example of a perfect comedy movie. Charismatic leads (Murray and McDowell), great idea, excellent screenplay, well paced, good director, nice balance of humour, message and romance. One of those films I don't get tired of rewatching.",10,0,0,16 October 2001
Love Actually," Not bad, actually
","I enjoyed this film, including the little touches which asserted its Britishness. One or two of the stories were (even for a film with so many stories) underdeveloped, one or two of the scenes could've been edited, but in general it was cleverly done. Made me cry... <blub>I think what spoiled it was the totally ridiculous bit about the guy going to Milwaukee and... well, I won't say what happened, but c'mon, what was that?",8,0,5,14 February 2004
Rear Window," One of my all-time favourites
","I guess Cornell Woolrich deserves credit for the idea, but what Hitchcock did with it was genius. Hitchcock's movies were always stylised and sometimes it didn't work; with 'Rear Window' it comes off magnificently.
'Rear Window' is a bit like sitting in a theatre. James Stewart - superbly cast - is sitting next to you and the two of you are watching events on stage, wondering what to do about them since the amount of interaction that's permitted is limited.I'm always happy when this film appears in the TV listings - another excuse to watch it! There are so many 'suspicious neighbour' movies made these days, but the only way they can't come close to the naive excitement of 'Rear Window'.",10,0,2,1 July 2003
