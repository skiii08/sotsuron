Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Overrated; like the Coca-Cola, this movie is just another drink that most of the people seems to enjoy.
","The most anticipated movie of all times is about the origin of Anakin Skywalker, who will later become Darth Vader, and how will the 'Empire' become the oppressor of the Galaxy in the follow up movies (Star Wars: episodes IV, V and VI). We also get to see how some of the characters (as C3-PO and R2-D2)get involved in the saga. The movie is played by Liam Neesan in the role of Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn, Ewan McGregor as Obi wan Kenobi, Natalie Portman(Queen Amidala/Padme) and Jake Lloyd(Anakin Skywalker). The movie is fun to watch but lacks of that charismatic spark, between the characters, that made Star Wars a movie franchise. The main problem is that the story is lead by the character of Qui Gon Jinn, whose 'too calmed' attitude makes him boring in most of the scenes, to the point that makes you wonder if Neesan wanted to appear in the movie in the first place. Even his relationship with Obi-Wan, is that of a Batman with a Robin that never seems to get things right. There aren´t really enough scenes in which the characters interact with each other, to get to know them enough to finally make an impression in you. The clearest example of this is Darth Maul (Ray Park), whose character you don´t even remember that was in the film after you watched it. Important scenes between Anakin and Padme are suddenly cut before you get to realize the importance of the characters in the saga. So in the end all the characters, as Obi Wan puts it in the movie, are 'another pathetic life form' that joins in the journey. Also the peculiar way of speaking of Jar Jar Binks(Ahmed Best), makes it difficult to understand what he is saying to the point that you don´t care what his lines are about. And finally, the conclusion of the movie doesn´t seem as important as the race that takes place in the middle of it. Even, as a fan, I think that there are better books in the Star Wars cult saga than this movie. And speaking of being a fan, I think that there are some scenes that doesn´t make sense with the follow up movies. In other words, the characters lack of that charm between them that makes them look like a team and the story plot doesn´t seem to have as many work as the surroundings in the movie, which are in the end, the most relevant thing of the film. Star Wars Episode I is a good movie for the fans and the kids but not for the people who want to know what all the 'fuzz' is about.",7,0,1,8 July 1999
