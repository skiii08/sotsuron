Requiem for a Dream," 'I think the pills aren't working anymore'
","I think everything about this wonderful piece of cinema has already been said.   A great movie to bring a hard drug dealer/user to, or somebody addicted to 'diet pills' to look more attractive to.  If this movie does not effect them, then they will suffer far more than the characters did in this flick.  Powerhouse film all around.  Stay sober.  Peace",10,0,0,12 December 2000
