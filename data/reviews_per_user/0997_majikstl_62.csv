Vertigo," A fall from grace...
","(((((SPOILERS)))))I don't think that I have made an effort to like or, at least, respect any movie more than I have Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO. I have seen it maybe half a dozen times on the big and small screens, read reviews and analyses of it, as well as essays about it in a couple of Hitchcock biographies. I recognize just how it fits into Hitchcock's filmography and how it details his notorious obsessions. It is an important film as far as the study of Hitchcock is concerned. But, in the end, VERTIGO is just not a very good movie. I don't see why it is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time; indeed, I wouldn't even place it in Hitchcock's top twenty. Instead of appreciating it more each time I view it, I find myself resenting the way it distracts from Hitchcock's better efforts.The premise -- basically a variation of 'Frankenstein' by way of a dark and brooding 'My Fair Lady' -- involves a man's attempt to reshape a woman into the image of a woman he thought he loved and lost, not realizing they are the same woman. The concept is intriguing in theory, but largely unbelievable in execution. The film is told in two halves, the first being a detective story. It involves the type of ludicrously contrived murder scheme that only works in old self-mocking whodunits (''You see,' explained Nick to Nora, in between sips of his martini, 'Gavin had to use Scottie as his patsy, because a man who was not deathly afraid of heights might have climbed to the top of the bell tower and discovered....'') You get the idea. Almost like a trial run for the far superior PSYCHO, Hitchcock concocts a convoluted thriller storyline which ultimately only serves as a set up for the psychological drama in the second half. This may be the only aspect of the film that shows Hitchcock's genius: using a far-fetched mystery narrative as a way of luring the viewer into the murkier melodrama that is the real center of the story. But, it seems Hitchcock was so fascinated in elements of the latter part of the story that he wasn't concerned with the plot holes and dubious logic that make the first half largely unbelievable. And, unfortunately, part two is hopelessly entangled in the clumsy web spun in part one.It is part two of the story that also fascinates the film's admirers (who tend to ignore or forgive the sloppy set up of part one). Having established that James Stewart as Scottie, has fallen in love with Kim Novak's Madeline, only to see her apparently commit suicide, the film introduces Judy, also Novak, who is a dead ringer for Madeline. On meeting Judy, one would think that a trained detective like Scottie would immediately be suspicious and begin to investigate her past, instead he starts playing Henry Higgins and begins training Judy to again look and act like 'Madeline.' Judy, who should realize that Scottie can implicate her in a murder, plays along, presumably because she has fallen madly in love with Scottie. But basically, no one does anything logical in this film, everybody being hopeless enslaved by the rather silly plot, rather than by obsessive love or psychological turmoil. The film just doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, either dramatically or psychologically.Okay, films, especially Hitchcock's, are less about plot than style. But even so, the film is substandard, especially for a Hitchcock film. There are a few clever shots and striking images, but that is overshadowed by slow pacing, a very hokey dream sequence and stilted dialogue. And there are some odd choices involving the use of color that prove particularly annoying. At first, I thought the muddy, muted look of the film was the result of badly aged prints, but seeing the restored version proves this not to be the case. And for some reason, Jimmy Stewart's face seems bright orange in every print of the film I have seen. The look of the film is so annoying, that the last time I watched it, I turned the color off on my TV set. The film actually plays better in black and white, reflecting its pulp film noir elements.It seems that the reason the film's reputation has skyrocketed over the years has less to do with Hitchcock's skill at making it, than that VERTIGO represents a convenient checklist of all his phobias, fetishes and obsessive visions. Those who have laboriously defended the film seem to skim over the gaping holes in its logic, dwelling on the film's paper-thin psychology: The film's protagonist Scottie representing Hitchcock and his not-so healthy desire to control and abuse women of a certain type. Okay, maybe that is so. But a psychological profile is not necessarily the same as a work of art -- or even passable entertainment. Hitchcock may -- or may not -- be revealing his psyche more in this film than in any other he ever made, which makes it Jim-dandy for discussion of his entire career, but that doesn't mean VERTIGO stands up on its own.Rather than representing the epitome of what the name Hitchcock stands for, VERTIGO should represent some sort of embarrassment. The story is poorly plotted and poorly told. Novak and Barabra Bel Geddes give solid performances, but Stewart is just terrible in the central role; it just may be is worst screen performance. And Hitchcock's stylistic touches seem self-consciously obvious, detracting form the drama rather than underscoring it. But, as a dress rehearsal for what he would soon accomplish, VERTIGO works decently enough. The red herring first act, the unexpected death of the leading lady, the psychologically scarred protagonist with necrophilic leanings (played by an actor with an established boy-next-door image), the denial of a one woman's death by creating the illusion she exists in another person's body; these are all elements that would rise again in PSYCHO, Hitchcock's true masterpiece. PSYCHO realizes the vision that VERTIGO only promises.",3,55,99,15 May 2004
Love and Death," 'You have the temerity to say that I'm talking to you out of jejunosity?'
","A persistent complaint about Woody Allen movies (by people who proudly admit that they never watch Woody Allen's movies) is that all of his movies are the same. You know -- if you've seen one, you've seen them all. That is not a fair assessment. Of course, he repeats themes and ideas and muses over philosophical non sequiturs over and over again -- sometimes, ad nauseum. And he certainly isn't above repeating a joke, good or bad. Yet, in his four decades as a filmmaker he has shown a remarkable amount of variety in his style and subject matter, without really straying too far from his home turf. From musicals to murder mysteries, from farces to overtly depressing melodramas, he manages to be fairly unpredictable.Yet, while watching LOVE AND DEATH, it struck me that it is practically a remake of his previous film, SLEEPER. It would seem that the only things they would have in common are that they feature his favored muse, Diane Keaton, and that they are the last two of his so-called 'early, funny movies.' After that, you have SLEEPER, which takes place in the far future in America and LOVE AND DEATH which takes place in Russia, in the far past. Yet, they are both period pieces, mocking specific types of literary/cinematic genres (sci-fi and historical epic) and as such are time warp comedies, wherein most of the humor comes from injecting Woody's 20th century, New York, Jewish/atheist, left-wing, intellectual pessimism into an alien time and place. And looking past the settings, the plots are identical: Woody's prototypical nebbish/coward falls in love with Keaton's vapid, but provocative kook, while they both get sucked up in revolutionary politics and plots to assassinate tyrannical leaders.The political assassination angle is intriguing. He treats it in a farcical fashion in both SLEEPER and LOVE AND DEATH, just as it was used as a running gag throughout BANANAS. He'd bring it up again, most famously perhaps, in ANNIE HALL, when he confesses that his character's obsession with the JFK killing was a mere pretense to avoid having sex with his wife. Though Allen has never been a particularly political comedian, this minor obsession with political violence does seem to have a point, whether it was intended as such by Woody or not. Even though he seems to suggest (albeit in jest and with much reluctance and equivocation) that assassination is the wrong, yet possibly the most efficient means of political change; his greater message is the futility of such acts. Reactionary violence, and indeed war itself, is mocked as being pointless and trivial -- which, I suppose, is also his pessimistic outlook on life, art and, well, just about everything else.The one thing he consistently claims to take seriously is death. Yet, even as he places it right up front in the title of LOVE AND DEATH, his vision of it here is that of the purely cliché Grim Reaper -- hood and cycle and all. Indeed, for an artist supposedly obsessed with death, it really isn't part of his repertoire. Woody's own death is a punchline in LOVE AND DEATH, SCOOP and even CASINO ROYALE. In A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S SEX COMEDY, it is a whimsical plot twist and in EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU it is an excuse for a musical number. The murders at the heart of his later films, like CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY, BULLETS OVER BR0ADWAY and MATCH POINT, pointedly place the violence off screen. And the suicide in INTERIORS -- like everything else in the film -- is property borrowed from Bergman. Rather than being obsessed with death, Allen seems more inclined to distance himself from it altogether. Certainly one of his limitations as a director is his inability or unwillingness to deal with unpleasant things like death or violence, except in an aloof, second-hand way. His clumsy handling of the battle scenes in LOVE AND DEATH attest to this -- though arguably such scenes are funnier because they are so poorly staged.Despite a title that promises big themes, LOVE AND DEATH is the last of his gag-driven comedies, less interested in plot and character than in churning out comedy bits. It is interesting that even though LOVE AND DEATH is one of Woody's most esoteric films, it is also one of his most accessible ones. Never one to dumb-down his material for mass consumption, he seems to purposely build so much of the humor and action in the film around familiarity with Russian literature and history -- hardly topics of common knowledge (much less interest) to the vast number of filmgoers, even the more sophisticated ones that Allen attracts. Yet, the film is packed with sight gags, anachronisms and universal observations, so that little of the material goes over the viewer's head. Grandiose themes of epic novels and philosophical theories are cut down to size by a burlesque approach that hearkens back visually to the silent era, as well as the low-brow sarcasm of the films of Bob Hope. One doesn't have to understand the philosophy or recognize the literary references to realize that what is being ridiculed isn't just the the source material itself, but the pomposity of it all -- even the pretentiousness of Woody choosing such a high-brow subject in the first place. If you don't get the source of the joke, the way it is reduced to skillful double talk and pseudo-intellectual patter is funny in its own right. For both better and worse, Woody's growth as a filmmaker would soon make him less willing to be so cavalier with such material. But, for all of its obscure literary references, LOVE AND DEATH is one Woody's silliest films -- and one of the reasons we miss his 'early, funny movies' so much.",8,1,1,24 August 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Brain-rot: Cultural Dumbing Down of America for Make Wealthy Insensitive and Greedy Hack Comedian
","How to adequately describe Sasha Baron Cohen's BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERlCA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN? How about lame? And exploitive.And vulgar.Amateurish.Cheesy.Sleazy.Anti-Semitic.Racist.Hateful.Homophobic.Corrupt.Insultingly contemptible.And most of all: Unfunny. Excruciatingly unfunny. Extremely excruciatingly unfunny.Is there anything positive that can be said about BORAT-BLAH-BLAH-BLAH? There sure is: It's short. Yet, at 84 minutes it still drags on interminably. And the amazing thing is that even though writer/star Cohen and his director Larry Charles filmed many hours of material, this sloppy hodge-podge of cheap shots and crude gags is apparently the best they could scrape up and slap together. This is the funniest stuff they could find? Apparently so. But when you start with garbage, you can't expect haute cuisine -- but something at least non-toxic would have been nice.Even marking the continued slow decline of the so-called mockumentary, a genre of comedy pioneered with films like Rob Reiner's THIS IS SPINAL TAP and Woody Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN and ZELIG, BORAT is nothing less than an embarrassment. Evidently, it is meant to be a satire of reality TV and/or crude travel documentaries, but BORAT has more in common with the tactless trash made by pseudo-journalists like Michael Moore. Like Moore and his ilk, when true creative inspiration is nonexistent, Cohen sets up real people in booby-trapped situations designed to mock and humiliate them. And then he hides his cunning dishonesty and lack of ethics behind the claim he is using deception to find out how people really act and what they truly believe. Truth through lies. How Orwellian. And beyond this hypocrisy is its sheer cowardice and laziness in attacking easy targets. The result is less like cinema verite and more like a nihilistic 'Candid Camera.' British comic Cohen plays Borat Sagdiyev, supposedly a TV reporter from Kazakhstan, a poor country in Eastern European which inexplicably has a TV station, but no toilets. Consistency isn't one of this film's strong points: Borat's hobby is collecting humiliating Polaroids of women on the john, yet later he seems to have no idea what a toilet is or how to use it. And though he can quote Clint Eastwood movies, he apparently doesn't know what a turtle is. Borat's level of intelligence and sophistication fluctuates according to how low the film wants to go for a joke -- and there seems to be no end to the depths. Anyway, Borat heads to the United States to make his documentary and prove America is an ugly place; but ultimately the film only proves that our immigration laws are far too lax.In an insipid one-note performance, Cohen milks the ignorant peasant bit far beyond its meager credibility. His whole shtick is stolen from Bronson Pinchot's Balki Bartokomous, which he copied from Andy Kaufman's Latka Gravas, who imitated Bill Dana's Jose Jimenez, who owed a lot to Chico Marx. All and all, it has all been done better, and with greater affection by real immigrants like Yakov Smirnoff. While each progression has made the basic character increasingly dim, Cohen takes the archetype a giant leap downward by making his characterization utterly hateful and devoid of charm. The sweet naivete that has always defined the foreign visitor stereotype is all but gone with Cohen draining his smirking and leering Borat of all traces of innocence. You'd be hard pressed to find a more contemptible lout anywhere this side of 'The Jerry Springer Show.' Worse, Cohen is an opportunist, a rapist/con man who time after time is shown gaining the good graces of innocent people who welcome him and befriend him, only to have their kindness repaid through ridicule and exploitation. Cohen is being praised as a creative genius when it is all too apparent he is an immoral manipulator. And since the entire film builds to an attempt to kidnap actress Pamela Anderson, you can add celebrity stalker to the list.But the nauseating thing about BORAT is not Cohen's predatory approach to comedy or even the film's cold-blooded indifference to human dignity -- or for that matter even the public's willingness to once again to be treated so condescendingly -- but that this whole unsightly mess has been embraced by critics who should know better. When the Sasha Baron Cohens and the Tom Greenes and the Michael Moores and the South Park guys and all the other cultural bullies spew their bile at the audience, their snide, antisocial sadism always seems to be forgiven because 'Come on, guys, it's a just joke.' 'Is nice!' says Borat. No, it's not nice. It's pathetic.",1,13,28,18 January 2007
Requiem for a Dream," Reefer Madness for the MTV generation...
","This is a film. This a film addicted to gimmicks. SPLAT! Any questions?The pretentiously titled REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is a film that is dark, depressing, achingly dreary and laughably awful at every turn. It is like watching a drunk or an addict wallowing in self pity, only to have him interrupt his moaning and groaning with fits of uncontrollable laughter. You don't know whether to pity him, laugh at him or just smile and slowly back away. Nowhere else will you find a film so self-consciously solemn and meticulously constructed, yet so hysterically out of control.The film is about the evils of addiction, so it is ironic that the director is hopelessly addicted to clichés and gimmicks. One thing for certain is that director Darren Aronofsky seems desperate to impress somebody. He's the kid with the thesaurus who can't turn in a book report unless he makes certain that every word is at least 10 letters long. Only now he's a film school kid who just figured out how to use all those cool gadgets on the camera. As such, REQUIEM is wall-to-wall cinematic tricks: split screens, split-second editing, fisheye images, fast forward, time lapse and oh-so many really nifty-crazy-weird camera angles. It all goes for that Oh-wow! factor. But when every scene is a calculated stunt, then no individual stunt has any effect. It's like an opera screeched in only one note or a room where everything is the same shade of blood red. The overall effect is shockingly effective only because it is all so unrelentingly unpleasant.The idea, I suppose, is to clue us in on how hyper the world must seem in a drug induced haze, but that is rendered meaningless since the film goes hyper even during innocuous moments. Indeed, what passes for everyday reality is presented as being so melodramatically arty or intensely overwrought that at times Aronofsky has to resort to the overtly ridiculous to even get back our attention. By the time Ellen Burstyn, as a diet pill-addicted old lady, finds herself being terrorized by her refrigerator, the film takes on the air of a particularly grotesque skit from Monty Python. Even worse than Aronofsky's taste for psychedelic overkill (apparently inspired in equal parts by bad MTV videos, trendy TV commercials and grade-C drug movies of the 60s), is the director's self-righteous arrogance in assuming he has something original to say. Drugs are bad! Gosh, who knew? But even the simple nobility of that sentiment is buried under the sludge of his technique. The fates of the four main characters is so extreme, and so extremely presented, that the film unintentionally trivializes the very lecture it so pompously presents. Their fates -- insanity, mutilation, prison and sexual degradation -- are presented, not with an air of remorse and pity, but as a manic cinematic freak show. This is REEFER MADNESS on LSD; scare tactic propaganda served up as if it were from a crazed evangelist. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the poor actors are forced to overact just to keep up with the hectic pace of the film's stylistics. Lost between their obviously phony Nu Yook accents and bug-eyed emoting, there is little room for genuine characterizations. Indeed, the fact that any semblance of a performances even survives is remarkable considering Aronofsky's veg-a-matic editing style. There are poignant moments, however fleeting, when the actors reveal depth and complexity in their characters, but those instances of subtlety are brushed aside as Aronofsky rushes to get back to the grandiose surrealism. Can there be anything more personal than an addiction? Yet, Aronofsky has made a film that is frenetic, yet cold and mechanical. This is a film by a filmmaker who has no faith in either his message or his audience. Everything is hammered home, amplified and repeated because the director doesn't think we will get it if he simply states the obvious. Had Aronofsky just made a simple little horror movie, maybe his gross-out/creep-out/freak-out stylistics might have been amusing. But he has tackled a serious social issue and reduced drug abuse to the level of being a Freddie Krueger bogeyman. I don't doubt the sincerity of his anti-drug rant, I just find it hopelessly condescending. It is film-making as shock treatment, designed to beat the viewer down to the point of vulnerability, exhausted and ready for brainwashing.",1,143,257,22 July 2004
Casablanca," 'The fundamental things apply ....'
","CASABLANCA is one strange little movie. It takes place in French Morocco and is populated with characters and actors from all over war-torn Europe, yet it is quintessentially American. It is rich in humor, but it isn't a comedy. It is a war movie, but its one great battle sequence is the singing of rival national anthems. It is plotted like a soap opera -- indeed, it is essentially a 'woman's picture' -- but is directed like a spy movie. It is a film filled with intrigue, but offers only a vague sense of danger -- mostly it is about people standing around talking. Considered one of the most romantic movies of all times, there is little romance and only fleeting moments of passion. Romance and heroism are defined not by what the characters do, but what they don't do. It is about sacrifice, doing without now in the hopes that it will benefit the greater good. The great triumph at the end finds two lovers parting ways, probably never to see each other again. And, yet, that is the happy ending as nobility conquers cynicism. Long before I actually saw CASABLANCA, I had already seen bits and pieces, read about it in reviews and film history books, and even owned the screenplay. It was parodied in one of my favorite films, Woody Allen's PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM. Its famed dialogue had long since become beloved cliché. So, when I finally saw the film, it was anticlimactic; I knew the story, the dialogue and even the ending -- watching it was like watching a rerun, nothing seemed fresh. I was vaguely disappointed. But over the years I've viewed it again and again, and liked it a bit more each time. I'm still not ready to concede that it is one of the great films, yet it succeeds at being something more; any failings it has as drama are inconsequential compared to its status as a cultural icon. It transcends being a mere movie and is as much of the American pop psyche as 'Yankee Doodle Dandy,' 'Tom Sawyer,' Norman Rockwell's paintings, Graceland and the '57 Chevy. America would be just a little less great without it.Basically, the film is a standard love triangle: Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) finds herself torn between the dark, mysterious Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and the pure and noble Victor (Paul Henried). Yet, Ilsa isn't the film's central character nor is the film from her perspective; Rick, the 'other man,' ultimately controls everybody's destiny. In a broader sense, Ilsa is the world at large, torn between Victor and his resistance to Nazi aggression and Rick, an American defiantly striving to remain, if not neutral, at least isolated from the encroaching war. Rick's decision to 'stick his neck out' is America's decision to enter the war. It is said that while filmming, no one knew just how it would end; in reality it couldn't end any other way and still be true to the American spirit. One thing that repeated viewings reveal is just how well the film is acted. It has a notable cast of character actors from the era -- Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, etc. -- and the inimitable Claude Rains practically steals the film as Captain Renault, the cheerfully pragmatic 'poor corrupt official.' For Bogart, it was the pivotal role of his career, bridging his persona from tough guy roles to a more heroic image as a leading man. His Rick is an enigmatic character, who he plays with cynical restraint and the occasional flash of sly wit. Bergman's role is remarkably small, yet she plays Ilsa with cool intensity that borders on cunning. She shows Ilsa to be a woman who is use to being quiet, almost subservient, as a means of camouflage. Bergman does most of her acting with her eyes, studying other characters and reading their motives. And she is absolutely gorgeous throughout. But perhaps the film remains so beloved, not because of the romance or its nationalism; but because it is quite funny. Humor in a film can be a sign that the material isn't being taken seriously, but when it is done this well, the opposite is true. Here wit defines the characters and reveals not just their attitudes, but their intelligence. A film that so easily could have fallen into the trap of easy patriotic platitudes instead uses humor to define cynicism and enhance conflict. More than just one-liners, the crisp dialogue defines the characters as intelligent and complicated individuals.Though CASABLANCA remains a beloved film, I wonder just how much of that reverence is based on nostalgia; so much of what the film represents is passe, or at least politically incorrect. A submissive woman who begs a man to think for her would be declared an insult in our post-feminist society. Few believe in the nobility of war any more, regardless of the circumstances; and fewer still see the value of self-sacrifice. Maybe that is the secret of CASABLANCA: it isn't about who we are or who we once were, but about who we would really like to be.",8,3,7,9 May 2007
Citizen Kane," The Distinguished Citizen ...
","There is a telling moment in CITIZEN KANE that quietly reveals a lot about what makes the film great. It is a scene set in the dark days of the Great Depression, where Kane is turning over much of his empire to his arch-nemesis, Thatcher. As they talk, Kane casually walks away from the camera and we suddenly discover that the room the men are in is an illusion. The background wall that looks to be right behind the them is actually twenty or thirty feet away, the window sill isn't at waist height, but actually is over Kane's head. The room is huge and Kane is dwarfed by his surroundings. Kane than walks back toward the camera and perspective again creates an illusionary intimate image.It is a neat camera trick and KANE is full of neat camera tricks. It discretely plays with our perception of reality, just as the story does. Through out, Charles Foster Kane is at a distance and slightly out of focus and then he is up close and personal; he is larger than life and suddenly small and petty; he is always at the center of the picture, yet concedes the foreground to the various witnesses who tell his story. CITIZEN KANE is a treasure chest of cinematic gadgets and gizmos; yet as deliciously stylized as KANE is, the style meshes perfectly with the content. CITIZEN KANE is a story of illusions and perceptions told through illusions and perceptions. Before KANE, and for the most part afterward, no film has quite taken hold of the medium of film and done so much with it. Other directors have tried to dazzle us with how cleverly stylish they can make their films, but usually the effect is self-consciously arty: Every rabbit pulled out of a hat is greeted with a drum roll and a fanfare. The beauty of KANE and the reason director Orson Welles remains an artist of awed respect, arise from the casual grace with which he performed his magic tricks. His rabbits are in themselves so fascinating that how he produces them is only of secondary interest. Yet for a film obsessed with stylistic trickery, CITIZEN KANE still manages to be an incredibly personal story.To say a film is efficient may seem like a backhanded compliment, but part of the wonder of KANE is that it tells so much story and covers so much territory on a B-movie budget. It is an epic created on sound stages and with editorial mosaics. Welles begins his film with a mock newsreel obituary announcing Kane's passing, then basically repeats aspects of that same story several times over from different perspectives, maintaining a vague chronology, but jumping around in time to let us know that there is more to a life than the mere passage of time. Welles tells us who Kane was to the world, then who he was to the people who actually knew him -- suggesting that who we are is defined not by what we have done but by who we have touched. It is one of the most effective and insightful film biographies that was ever made. The fact that it is a biography of a fictional character is totally irrelevant.The essence of CITIZEN KANE is the fable of the blind men and the elephant. Like the blind men, who, upon examining only a part of the beast, assume that the elephant is a rope (the tail), a tree (a leg), a sword (a tusk), etc., the witnesses to Kane's life see him as a spoiled child, an idealist, a hypocrite, a monster and so on and so forth. All are correct, yet all are wrong, only seeing in Kane what they want to see. We never meet Kane the man, only Kane the illusion, yet we end up with a vague grasp of who he must have been. If CITIZEN KANE offers any universal truth it is that a life -- or a movie -- is more than the sum of the parts.Even given all the well-deserved praise proffered to Welles as a director, he never seems to get his due as an actor. His embodiment of Charles Foster Kane is, simply put, one of the great screen performances of all time. We remember that KANE saw Welles as a first time director, but it was also his first time on screen professionally and he gives a performance that is both self-assured and subtle, bold and bemused. Taking Kane from his twenties to his sunset years without a false note, giving a performance that combines gentle humor with grandiose theatrics, Welles creates a character of shifting moods and conflicting motives, yet always consistently believable. In later years, Welles perfected his persona of larger-than-life bluster and wounded arrogance, on screen and off, but he never again got a chance to play a character of such complexity and nuance.KANE's status as 'the greatest film ever made' is always being challenged, defended and debated, yet it is remarkable how seldom the film itself is imitated. Despite being given this perfect blueprint for how to film a biography, it is rare that any film attempts to break free of the this-happened-that-happened style of storytelling. It is as if the legendary stature of the film intimidates others.Hitchcock once said that film is life with all the dull parts edited out. Welles adheres to this and goes one better: CITIZEN KANE is all highlights and underlined passages, a Cliff Notes biography of sorts. Does this allow us to get to know the real Charles Foster Kane? Well, yes, and no. We are allowed to solve the mystery of 'Rosebud,' but Kane the man remains just out of our reach. We never really meet Charles Foster Kane, only his shadows. Welles and screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz give us pieces of a puzzle, but the pieces are not all from the same puzzle.",10,18,28,13 June 2005
Madagascar," Call of the mild ...
","Since all modern animated features apparently have to deliver some sort of edifying message, MADAGASCAR has a moral as well. The message, however, is painfully obvious, though MADAGASCAR does illustrate it quite well. The message is: penguins are funny -- and lions, zebras, giraffes and hippos aren't. Unfortunately, it takes an hour and half to get this message across, the bulk of which is wasted on a lion, a zebra, a giraffe and a hippo, while four clever, adorable and delightfully humorous little penguins barely get any screen time at all. They nevertheless steal what little there is worth stealing in this woefully pointless cartoon.The film begins in New York City, in the Central Park Zoo, which oddly enough only seems to have about ten animals in captivity. In addition to the lion, the zebra, the giraffe, the hippo and the four adorable little penguins, there is also a pair of monkeys, who might have been funny as well, if they weren't given even less screen time than the penguins. The plot finds the four little penguins plotting to escape, which leads to a tedious series of events that ultimately finds the lion, the zebra, the giraffe and the hippo shipwrecked on the African coast where their pampered existence in the zoo leaves them ill prepared to live in the wild. When you get right down to it, MADAGASCAR is really only about the lion and the zebra, the Dreamworks studio apparently thought it necessary to pad the story with other unnecessary characters because the giraffe, the hippo, the four penguins, the pair of monkeys and an assortment of African creatures would supply the company with more characters to potentially exploit in merchandising tie-ins as stuffed animals, Happy Meal action figures and various other toys.And as a commercial for such items, MADAGASCAR certainly is adequate, as if that were enough. Like most Dreamworks CGI cartoons, the art work is colorful and detailed. But that is where the creativity stops; the screenplay begins with an okay idea, but is not otherwise well written nor does it have a point. The characters are either smart or stupid, depending on which posture is necessary in the scene, thus they supposedly know nothing about life outside the zoo, but when required they have a detailed knowledge of world geography, can commandeer a massive seafaring freighter or belt out showtunes. And the use of music in the film is particularly atrocious: the tiresomely uninspired use of standards ('Staying Alive,' 'Born Free,' 'Chariots of Fire,' etc.) seems obviously designed to slap together a golden oldies soundtrack album. And, of course, celebrity voices are used as a substitute for creative character animation.As a comparison, some versions of MADAGASCAR include an animated short subject, 'The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper.' In it, three of the penguins go on a military-style mission to rescue the fourth, who has been accidentally mistaken for a stuffed animal and is destined to be a dog's chew toy. It is as nicely animated as MADAGASCAR, but its story is clever and concise and the penguins are blessed with vivid personalities and at 11 minutes it is infinitely more fun. Though obviously derivative of the work by Dreamworks rival Pixar ('Toy Story' 1 and 2, in particular), the penguin short is at least borrowing from the best, rather than settling for being just adequate.But MADAGASCAR does deserve a bit of credit, however, for challenging the prevailing notion in the movies that romanticizes nature to an absurd extreme. Movies perpetuate the environmentally friendly, though logically foolish, idea that, if it weren't for man, all of God's creatures would live in perfect harmony. The obvious reality is that for most wild animals life is a day to day struggle to survive, both to find something to eat and to avoid being eaten. But the law of the jungle is not PC.In MADAGASCAR, the lion named Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller) and the zebra named Marty (voiced by Chris Rock) are buddy-buddy pals in the zoo, where they are star attractions and all their basic needs are met. But in the jungle, Alex's carnivorous tendencies must come to the surface in order for him to survive -- and as such Marty, his main man in the city, begins to look more like his main course in the wilderness. Thus the film does create an artistic and philosophical dilemma for the filmmakers: how to maintain the illusion of an ecumenical brotherhood between the species and also accept the not-so-pleasant reality that sometimes cute animals are not born to be free, but born to be lunch. The film finesses the problem with a technicality -- fish apparently aren't considered animals -- which should please everyone except PETA. Though the viewer might be inclined to root for Alex to eat Marty just to be spared any more of Chris Rock's gratingly unpleasant performance. Now, to me, that would be a happy ending.",3,0,1,2 May 2007
Dead Poets Society," Poetic injustice
","There is a scene early in DEAD POETS SOCIETY wherein Robin Williams, as a new literature teacher at an upscale boys prep school, tells his class that he wants them to learn to think for themselves. To this end, he orders them to tear out of their text books pages which feature commentary by the book's editor. 'Think' he seems to be saying, 'but first, let me censor this book.' Free thought through censorship? I can only assume the said literature book includes Orwell's '1984.'In Orwellian fashion, hypocrisy is the order of the day in DEAD POETS SOCIETY. It gives a rousing, inspirational sermon ('Seize the day!' is the teacher's motto.), yet the story itself mocks the film's supposed intentions. DEAD POETS SOCIETY is about failure, but it won't admit it; worse, it seems to believe it's own inspirational PR. The film serves up a tacked on and utterly false moment of triumph at the end, but everything that proceeds that is a lesson in failure. Williams fails to teach the students to show moral courage. One student commits suicide rather than fight for his beliefs. When Williams is wrongly accused of something, his supposedly adoring students turn on him like a pack of weasels. The one student who stands up for his ideals is expelled from the school and forgotten by the film. A father fails his son. The school fails its students. And the film fails its audience.Yet, for some inexplicable reason, people remember the film for its inspirational message: Seize the day! Carpe Diem! Fine words, but at no time are they supported by the empty pessimism that the film displays. The characters who do take chances are immediately and soundly punished. Those who knuckle under -- showy, petty acts of deviance aside -- plod along.
Williams is okay as the teacher, but all credibility is lost when he stops to toss in imitations of Marlon Brando and John Wayne. Robert Sean Leonard comes off best as the doomed student, though his suicide seems remarkably undermotivated. Kurtwood Smith offers up a wholly unconvincing stereotype as the doomed student's martinet father. Thanks to Peter Weir's efficient direction and some nice cinematography, DEAD POETS SOCIETY has a facade of class; but only if you don't pay too close attention to Tom Schulman's dreadful (though Oscar-winning) script. The irony is that a film that begs you to think is best enjoyed if you don't.",2,54,132,7 March 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Hide in plain sight...
","BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is the 'gay cowboy movie.' Well, it is and it isn't.For one thing the two protagonists meet while herding sheep, not cattle; but they could just as easily be construction workers, truck drivers, butchers, bakers, candlestick makers or any regular joes who work for a living and are burdened by social expectations, responsibilities and the entire mythos of what it is supposed to take to be a man. As such, what it means to be gay in our still evolving world is absolutely central to what the film is all about, yet totally irrelevant. Gay or straight, the isolation and silent desperation that tortures the two young men in this film are feelings that are more common in males then we usually suspect or would ever like to admit.But homosexuality, especially being gay in rural or working class worlds, intensifies and deepens the burdens. BROKEBACK is about the things men don't talk about -- and not just what two men might do when alone, in the dark and in the throes of passion. BROKEBACK is about fear and pain and vulnerability and loneliness -- all the things that men are told they must swallow and deny if they are to earn the right to be men. The film is a courageous landmark in the depiction of homosexuality in drama, yet it is also a brave and rare examination of what it is to be a man, any man.It is the story of Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal), two wranglers for hire. During a stint minding sheep in the Wyoming highlands -- on Brokeback Mountain in 1963 -- they each discover that the other is not just his one true love, but also his one true friend. They are two lost souls who find each other literally in the middle of nowhere. They bond with an intensity that is rare in friendships and probably just as rare in marriages. They find they can share, not just their passion, but their dreams and their loneliness. The irony is they only feel comfortable and safe embracing their all consuming love out in the open, in the wide open spaces and isolated privacy of God's country. The two can be as one, but only if they remain part of nature, far removed from the rest of the world.But that other world exists and demands that they deny their love by also denying their friendship. Separated by states and states of mind, over the next twenty years they build separate lives and separate families, Ennis in Wyoming and Jack in Texas. But they can't stay apart and they don't do a very good job of hiding their passion. Torn between doing the right thing for their wives and children and doing right by each other, they compromise everyone and everything, including their love.Sparsely written by Larry McMurtry & Diana Ossana from E. Annie Proulx's crusty short story and poetically directed by Ang Lee, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a beautiful blend of the imagery and mythos of the American western with the flavor of European drama. It is acted without pretense by Ledger and Gyllenhaal who capture with understated eloquence the rowdy passion and the frightened tenderness of their characters.As a 'gay' film, BROKEBACK is a stunning breath of fresh air. Ennis and Jack are not sexual predators or serial killers, they're not preening and prancing promiscuous little disco boys on the make or effete golden boys and they're not puppydog best friends designed to make the liberal main character feel good about herself. They are just average, non-glamorous working class guys who just want the same things out of life as any straight guy: acceptance, family, love. Their sexuality isn't treated as a tragedy or a joke, but as a fact of life. Ennis and Jack are typical working class men, not tiresomely stereotypical gay men.As honest as BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is in dealing with homosexuality, it is just as intent on offering a realistic picture of masculinity. The image of men -- American males in particular -- has been progressively denigrated in our society; men are demonized as abusers and wife beaters by the feminists and trivialized into ugly, violent, macho jokes by our Quentin Tarantino influenced media. The film was greeted with worries that straight men would not be able to relate to a gay love story, but the sympathetic vision of masculinity it proffers transcends questions of orientation.Few films do a better job of illustrating the buried passions of the average man. Replace the gay narrative with feelings of unrequited passion to travel or create or succeed or just to escape, and much of what BROKEBACK deals with is universal. Ennis and Jack don't have to be gay for the story to work -- no more than Butch and Sundance or even Thelma and Louise -- but the passion and eroticism of their love, stated clearly and without innuendo, somehow make the other themes more pure and profound. They are social outlaws of victimless crimes.The film deserves a place among the ranks of the best of the traditional westerns. It offers an extension of the gay subtext found in such film as RED RIVER, THE OUTLAW and BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, but it also embraces the camaraderie between men and the communion with nature that is at the heart of the entire cowboy mythology. The film recognizes parallels between the solitary lives that often are part of being a cowboy or being gay, lives often lived just outside mainstream society. It is not a question of lifestyles, but about lives lived by different sets of rules.",10,5,6,28 December 2005
Match Point," 'You were collateral damage.'
","MATCH POINT makes its point right up front: 'I'd rather be lucky than good!' is the philosophy of the film and its protagonist and it's director, Woody Allen. However, neither Woody, nor the film, ever make it clear just what he means by 'good' -- good as in talented or good as in moral. Not that it matters, since the film's protagonist proves to be neither in particular. Moreover, the axiom doesn't really mean anything. It is like saying 'I'd rather wear a hat than a necktie;' the inference being that you have to choose. It's not an either/or situation; one can certainly be both lucky and good -- or neither. And no one can choose to be lucky or would choose to be unlucky. Thus, it is a meaningless premise: MATCH POINT sets out to argue over a non-sequitur.MATCH POINT was greeted with praise as Woody's 'comeback' film -- such nonsense! Given that Allen had directed and written and/or appeared in 24 movies in the decade and half prior to MATCH POINT, it is absurd to suggest he needed to make a comeback. Whether good (DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, EVERYBODY SAYS I LOVE YOU), bad (MELINDA AND MELINDA) or indifferent (ANYTHING ELSE, THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION), his films have always been worth watching and debating. And they have all been distinctively Woody Allen movies; despite a variety of genres and attempts to experiment with styles, his films have bore his imprint. Until MATCH POINT, which is so generically mundane in style and attitude that it could easily be mistaken for a Lifetime cable TV movie. Rather than rebirth, as some have suggested, MATCH POINT seems to suggest an artistic coma.Though described as a thriller, the film is mostly soap opera. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers stars as Chris Wilton, a middling tennis professional who takes a job instructing the game at a high-toned London club. By chance he is befriended by an heir to the wealthy Hewitt family and little by little becomes part of their inner circle. As a matter of course he ends up with a wealthy wife, a bothersome mistress and a murderous solution to this predicament. The story plods along with its unending backstory, not gaining any sort of thriller or murder mystery element until the third act, where the crime and the aftermath are played out with little intensity. Let's face it, Woody is not Hitchcock; the film is sadly lacking suspense, not to mention momentum.Devoid of Allen's keen sense of humor or even an attempt at being witty, the film lacks his New Yorker's self-deprecating musings. And even though it is his first film made in England, you wouldn't know it were it not for the actors' accents and the occasional appearance of those little black London taxis. The story seems to want to make something out of the British class structure -- working class social climbers marrying into old money -- but there is no sense of time or place or social standing in the film. And even though Allen makes repeated references to opera he fails in his attempt to make this meager drama seem like a grand tragedy.Like all of Woody's 'serious' films, MATCH POINT is slickly produced and well crafted, but it lacks a certain style, neither reflecting the mannered, pretentiousness of his artsy films like INTERIORS or ANOTHER WOMAN nor the haughty refinement of a typical Ivory-Merchant adaptation. The result is a film that is coldly efficient, but not engrossing. This is not helped much by the two leads. The supporting cast (Matthew Goode, Emily Mortimer, Brian Cox, etc.) are just fine, giving warm and intelligent performances, but Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johansson as the neurotic mistress are, at best, just annoying. Together they are a pretty, albeit shallow, pair, but they exhibit no chemistry; lacking romance, passion or eroticism, their affair is a mere plot contrivance. Apart, Rhys-Meyers is painfully passive almost to the point of lacking a personality; how he charms his way into the benevolent Hewitt family, let alone upper-crust society, is the film's true mystery. Coming off as a sullen teenager, Johansson's never lives up to her character's image as an alluring temptress in the first half and then degenerates into a self-obsessed demanding shrew, not unlike Anjelica Huston's similarly neurotic harridan in CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS. And, quite frankly, since neither character is 'good' in any sense of the word, why should we care if either is lucky. Allen defeats his premise long before he serves up his foregone conclusion.Though there is no 'Woody' character to act as his surrogate, the film is not devoid of all traces of Allen. The film boasts his standard theories about the randomness and pointlessness of human existence and the totally arbitrary nature of morality, ideas he has talked to death in previous films. But as trivial as his 'lucky vs. good' theory sounds, it is sadly pessimistic to suggest that all good things truly spring from the accident of existence, while striving to be good, either morally or professionally, is relatively pointless because it has no guarantees. 'Why bother trying,' he seems to be saying, ignoring the fact that relying on luck has even fewer guarantees. Plus, it is astonishingly hypocritical for Woody to promote this self-defeating philosophy. Though he often claims his success has been based on luck, it is dishonest of him to embrace such false modesty when his career has been built on his constant effort to make better movies and to improve his craft. But as luck would have it, MATCH POINT can't be pointed to as a good example of that.",4,1,4,22 January 2006
Milk," The Messiah of Castro Street
","I can't say that I have ever been much of a fan of Sean Penn as an actor. Despite all the praise he has gotten over the years, he has never been able to convince me that any of his characters are real. Even while watching him in his best films, MYSTIC RIVER and DEAD MAN WALKING, I always found myself thinking 'This would be so much better with a better actor in the part.' As such, I must grudgingly admit that he is absolutely wonderful in MILK. The awkward method mannerisms that plague most of Penn's work, and make his acting look like acting, are gone; he seems to melt into the character of Harvey Milk, an emotionally soft, but politically tough activist who somewhat reluctantly became the voice of the gay rights movement.Told in the usual this-happened-that-happened fashion of most film biographies, MILK is an efficiently told story, which nonetheless proves to be deeply moving. As much as it chronicles the growing public life of Harvey Milk, it also becomes the unfolding history of the gay rights movement as it grew in power and purpose during the 1970s. This is just, as Milk is a substantial part of that history; first because he made headlines as the first openly gay man to garner an important elected office, as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. And because of his death at the hands of a political rival. His growing influence earned him the title of The Mayor of Castro Street. His untimely death made him the Martyr of Castro Street. To some extent, the film portrays him as the Messiah of Castro Street, a soft-spoken, gentle and fundamentally decent Christ-like purveyor of inspiration.Castro Street was the mecca of gay life in the 1970s, first for gay people in San Francisco and then for the country as a whole. It was a small section of San Francisco which offered a semi-safe haven for gay people who wanted to feel protected and accepted. Milk landed there in the early part of the decade and opened up a small camera shop amid the gay bars and bookstores. As a gay merchant he felt left out of the system. As a gay man he felt left out of society. Feeling something should be done, he ran for office and, after three failures, won. His low-key, ingratiating style helped to establish him as a high-profile personality and the epitome of 'we're here, we're queer, get used to it,' a man who could be both forceful and non-threatening. His success at establishing gay rights laws gave him clout across the country, a voice the media could turn to as conservative anti-gay factions formed.Through the skillful use of news footage and recreation, director Gus Van Sant does a solid job of encapsulating a movement into two hours of cinema. He presents the anti-gay entities, such as Anita Bryant, with impersonal fairness, never resorting to cheap ridicule – though it is clear where his sympathies lie. Dealing with, but not dwelling on Milk's personal problems, the film interweaves Milk's private life with his growing activism, until his public persona overwhelms his personal life. As such, the film does seem a bit superficial in its portrait of Milk; much of the power of the story lies in the newsreel footage and the realization that the extraordinary events that are recreated are true. This leaves it up to Penn to fill in the blanks. He does so with assurance. Penn convincingly shows us Milk as being a quiet, reticent little man who learned to use his non-threatening image as a means of winning supporters, while becoming savvy to the ways of manipulating the media. Though he is supported by an ensemble of fine actors -- James Franco, Emile Hirsch, Josh Brolin, Victor Garber, etc. -- it is Penn who carries the film.",8,0,6,26 January 2009
The Prestige," Now you see it ... Now you wish you hadn't
","Sometimes I think movies are losing their magic. Over the years I have learned so much about the movie making process -- about how stunts and special effects are done -- that movies just don't amaze me quite as much any more. It takes a movie made with remarkable skill to make me forget the process that goes on behind the scenes to make the movie magic believable.To a great degree I suppose that is also true of magic as a performing art. The levitation trick or the sawing-a-woman-in-half bit may be eye-popping to one as a child, but eventually the magic of magic comes from learning the secret of the trick. The irony, of course, is that learning the secret usually destroys the magic. Knowledge is the natural enemy of illusion and magic (cinematic or sleight of hand) can only dazzle if it is so skillfully performed that the technique outweighs the mechanics. In short, achieving the 'Wow!' before facing the question of 'How?' THE PRESTIGE understands this, and yet it doesn't. It is, for most of the way, a flamboyant display of magician's showmanship, yet it builds up to a revelation of 'How?' which comes off as something of a cheat. When the film gets around to revealing the secrets of its tricks, the reality seems far less credible than the illusion of supernatural power. The fake reality of illusion is explained with an even faker illusion of reality.The film deals with two turn-of-the-century London magicians whose rivalry as competing showmen is fueled by ever-escalating acts of revenge. They strive to not just top each other as performing artists, but to sabotage each other as hated enemies. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play the competing wizards (Robert 'The Great Danton' Angier and Alfred 'The Professor' Borden), who form an emotional juggling act, constantly tossing back and forth the roles of villain and victim. Like a magical coin, sympathy for either man disappears and reappears at unexpected intervals. Likewise, director Christopher Nolan keeps all of his balls in the air, telling the story with flashbacks within flashbacks in a way that is not nearly as confusing as it could have been. All in all, a very intriguing concept for a movie.Unfortunately, the filmmakers become would-be escape artists and place their film and the two protagonist into traps from which they can't seem to logically escape. Both magicians focus their attention on 'The Transported Man' trick, which would appear to require the trickster to be in two places at once. But after promising not one, but two elaborate answers to how they did it, the film builds to a pair of shaggy dog endings, neither of which play fair with the audience. Alfred's secret seems so obvious in retrospect that viewers should have complete permission to slap themselves on their collective forehead for not seeing it coming a mile away. But the film cheats; revealing the secret early on by denying it as a possibility.On the other hand, Angier's secret takes a totally unconvincing sci-fi twist that not only doesn't play fair with the concept of magic as the art of illusion, but also defies the basic laws of physics. The story doesn't just cheat, it tries to change the trick in the middle of the performance. You don't leave the film feeling amazed; you leave feeling vaguely insulted, like the master illusionist has played you for a chump.Though lacking in humor (a vital distraction in creating illusion), THE PRESTIGE is a grandly played stunt, full of craftsmanship, showmanship and style. But it is like watching a magician who promises to produce a tiger out of thin air, but can only conjure up a kitten. The result isn't either 'Wow!' or 'How?' but 'Huh?'",5,24,51,30 October 2006
Crash," Dangerous intersections ...
","In Paul Haggis' powerful, yet artificial film, CRASH, characters who are introduced as being 'bad' eventually do something good to let us know that they are all really quite human. And people who we are introduced to us as being 'good' invariably do something bad, so that, well, we know that they are really quite human too. There is a logic to that, both from a literary and a humanistic point of view, but one gets the idea that Haggis wrote the screenplay with a scorecard at hand to make everything balance out just right. No one is too racist, no one is too mean, and certainly no one is too nice. And nobody in the audience will get too offended.CRASH is part of what is becoming a film sub-genre, the L.A. City of Strangers soap opera. Like its predecessors, Lawrence Kasdan's GRAND CANYON, Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS and Paul Thomas Anderson's MAGNOLIA, the film jumbles together an odd cross section of Los Angelenos whose lives crisscross and connect, some only by the finest of threads. These films advance the same thesis: that the City of (Fallen) Angels is a cold, uninviting city where people touch each other only by chance; their superficial lives become interconnected, but almost against everybody's will. These films are less cohesive epics than randomly juggled short stories. Indeed, that is what Altman's SHORT CUTS is, a collection of unrelated Raymond Carver short stories forcibly spliced into a single bleak reality.Like the more upbeat GRAND CANYON, CRASH uses race as a catalyst for drama, but unlike Kasdan's film, there are precious few inklings of optimism. The film's observation that everyone is at least a little bit racist is delivered with little subtlety; they all wear their bigotry on their sleeves. One is reminded of a scene in Spike Lee's JUNGLE FEVER where a waitress expresses her disapproval of an interracial couple with a loud and embarrassingly inappropriate tirade in the middle of the crowded restaurant. Haggis, like Lee, sees racism as being far more blatant then it really is and over vocalizes his characters' beliefs. Sometimes a roll of the eyes or a facial expression says more than a long-winded rant -- but, of course, that isn't nearly as dramatic. Some of the scenes in CRASH seem to have been written in all-caps, boldface, underlined and punctuated with multiple exclamation points. Used sparingly, such heightened drama can jar the viewer; used repeatedly it only rings uncomfortably false.Apparently, the goal of the film is to debunk racist stereotypes, but to do so the film first presents those stereotypes as a given. Unlike, say MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON, another film with pointedly multi-ethnic casting, CRASH doesn't ignore racial stereotypes, it presents them and then tries to defy them in a way that only ends up confirming them. Once established, the overt stereotypes linger: It is a politically correct backhanded sort of racism to define characters solely by their race or ethnicity or gender and then pretend that it doesn't really matter.Haggis' background is in episodic TV ('thirtysomething,' 'L.A. Law,' etc.) and it shows. CRASH is meted out in little bite-sized vignettes as it focuses on a group whose lives keep intertwining in an unrealistic, melodramatic way. In soap opera fashion, his mosaic of seemingly random occurrences all come together with far too many clumsy coincidences designed to stun us with unexpected irony. The effect is sometimes remarkably poignant, yet, when all the stories build to ironic twists, that irony becomes ineffective, diluted by its own calculated obviousness. The film ends with most of the stories unresolved, supposedly suggesting an attempt to mirror reality, yet even the messiness of its non-conclusion seems just too neatly contrived. One expects it to fade to black as the announcer invites us to stay tuned for scenes from next week's episode. It is a comfortable and not particularly daring way to tell a story.Yet, the film has an undeniable power to it. The actors manage to give intense and not always flattering performances that risk but never achieve caricature; no doubt contained by the relatively smallness of each part, the 'special guest star' actors punch home the symbolic value of their parts and fade into the ensemble before revealing their characters' shallowness. Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Ryan Phillippe, Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton stand out, as does rapper Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, playing with nice irony someone who hates rap because it is degrading to black people.Yet, rather than having the flavor of a MAGNOLIA or a SHORT CUTS, the story plays out like a grim politically correct 'Love Boat.' It's more glib than gritty. As a cultural mosaic, the film is more of a clash than a crash. The individual elements are intriguing and well made; but, when seen as a whole, the effort to make it all mesh into a complete mural seems artificial. There are far too many coincidences in far too short of a time. Haggis the director does just fine, but Haggis the writer succumbs to the impulse to make it all fit together in a tidy little package. As such, the jolts are more like fender benders than head-on collisions and the film dents when it tries to devastate.",5,2,9,13 May 2005
The Polar Express," The eyes don't have it...
","There is a fleeting moment in THE POLAR EXPRESS where the title vehicle passes a department store with an elaborate Christmas display in the window. Everyone is excited by the sight, especially the story's protagonist, 'Hero Boy,' until he sees the mechanical gears that reveal the display's Santa Claus to be a machine. That's the problem with THE POLAR EXPRESS, it is a splendid, wildly inventive machine, but it keeps on reminding us that it, quite literally, lacks a human face. Based on Chris Van Allsburg's slight but textured children's book, the film attempts to capture that book's subtle, albeit dark, visual tone. And for the most part the filmmakers do a stunning job. The artwork and animation, done largely with computers, is rich and detailed and often about as close to lifelike as any animation that I have ever seen. Therefore it is ironic that the remarkably high standards the film sets with most of the animation and artwork only serves to highlight the other aspects of the art that do fail so jarringly. The train, the snow, the sweeping landscapes and even the animals such as wolves and reindeer are all so incredibly meticulous in detail and movement, that it only makes the failure of the artists to replicate the human characters all the more startling and disappointing. The human beings in the story seem trapped in a limbo, being neither quite cartoon and certainly not quite human. It is strange that the animators do an outstanding job of recreating skin texture and coloring and even the various subtleties of hair, but can't quite recreate the most revealing aspect of being human, the eyes. The mouth movements are disappointing too, but it is the eyes that are, well, just plain creepy. Like the characters in Japanese anime or the sad orphans painted on black velvet, these characters have eyes that have a cold, spookiness to them. They are a mild, if unrelenting, distraction in some scenes, but they quietly spoil many of the major moments where the film strives for an emotional intimacy. It is a serious problem when you literally don't want to look a character in the eye, especially if the character is a child. The film uses a technology called 'performance capture,' wherein an actor actually gives a three-dimensional performance which is recorded digitally by a computer, to then be manipulated into animated art. Performance capture is an extension of CGI and, as used in films like THE LORD OF THE RINGS, further blurs the line between what is animation and what is special effects. The process seems to work fairly well as far as body movement goes; the animated characters move with genuine lifelike grace that is far superior to previous attempts, such as the animated action sequences in SPIDER-MAN or THE HULK. Indeed, a dance sequence involving a band of hyperkenetic waiters is a showstopper. But the process just does not work as far as detailing facial features. Cartoon humans from Elmer Fudd to Fred Flintstone are more simplistic, yet more human than the waxworks faces in THE POLAR EXPRESS. Their cartoonishness gives them a personality that is missing from the POLAR EXPRESS characters. I suppose that as the technology progresses, the ability to create totally believable human faces will be achieved to some credible degree. But the question is why? It's like making vanilla wafers with artificial flavoring; why seek a substitute for something natural and superior. The director of THE POLAR EXPRESS is Robert Zemeckis, a clever and skilled craftsman whose work includes the brilliant WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, a film that blends real and cartoon images wonderfully. THE POLAR EXPRESS would have been so much better had they followed the lead of ROGER RABBIT and, like SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, merged high-tech trickery with the simple honesty of the human face. Repeatedly throughout THE POLAR EXPRESS, I found myself wishing certain scenes were featuring real actors; I can't think of any other time where I thought a cartoon would be better as live action. Despite its optimistic Yuletide moral about the power of believing and its child's eye view of the world, the film really isn't a kids movie. THE POLAR EXPRESS has a Twilight Zone quality to it; not unlike the many versions of A CHR1STMAS CAROL or IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. The film is dark, and even in its most upbeat moments the story and the storytelling are strangely subdued. Not quite brooding or grim, but far from joyful. While obviously directing the film towards children, the filmmakers don't seem to understand kids. Little things are telling, like failing to give the characters names other than generic titles, like Hero Boy, Lonely Boy, Hero Girl, Know-It-All, etc. Such a lame literary device as reducing a character to a nameless symbolic entity is lost on children; they want to know people's names. Children can't relate to nameless, faceless characters. Neither can adults for that matter. Humans have names, and for that matter so do cartoon characters.Though it is seriously flawed, THE POLAR EXPRESS is still a remarkable effort, visually stunning and ultimately even emotionally rewarding. But no amount of artistic talent can capture the simple beauty or honesty of a living child's face; it may have been folly for the filmmakers to even try.",Null,39,56,23 November 2004
Closer," Up close and impersonal...
","CLOSER has the makings of your typical romantic comedy: A contrived change-partners-and-romance plot; love-at-first-sight meet-cute situations; glamorously superficial characters played by superficially glamorous actors; manipulative schemes to seduce and/or abandon lovers; and glib, archly self-satisfied dialogue. The film offers up nothing that hasn't been done hundreds, if not thousands, of times in hundreds, if not thousands, of movies and sitcoms. Indeed, it has everything you would want in a romantic comedy, except for two things: romance and comedy.Dark and brooding, CLOSER is one of those insufferably smug exercises in droning pomposity that truly thinks it is delivering a pious sermon of Truth and Honesty about Relationships -- though the word used in the movie isn't 'relationships,' but a less polite one that begins with the letter 'f.' The use of profanity -- the f-word being just one of many bandied about in the film with casual contempt -- is meant to punctuate just how Truthful and Honest the characters/filmmakers are. It is also an indication of just how lazy and/or pretentious the writer is.The basic storyline is trite, but admittedly dependable: She (Natalie Portman) loves he (Jude Law), who falls in love with her (Julia Roberts), who is attracted to him (Clive Owen) -- though everybody plays musical beds -- until, in the best of all possible soap operas fashion, everybody ends up (or doesn't end up) with the right person. But in CLOSER, who ends up with who is irrelevant, since the characters are so truly petty, self-centered and deceitful, it is impossible to care if any of them live happily ever after. Maybe that is screenwriters Patrick Marber's point: Lovers and liars are synonymous words -- unselfish love is a contradiction of terms. Such cynicism is nothing new in movies like this, but usually it is eased down with a bittersweet coat of humanity, if not humor. Marber revels in the bitter, but denies the sweet: The characters have to keep telling us just how madly in love they are with each other since the film supplies them with precious little screen time to actually show it. Any display of love, kindness or even respect between any given couple is merely a preamble to an act of betrayal or rejection or revenge.While enduring the movie, one can amuse oneself trying to figure out the point of the title, which seems to be a misnomer since no character really ever gets particularly close to another before they begin to push each other away. I assume the title refers to the way that the story condenses time into bite-sized pieces, revealing the film's roots as a multi-act play. Since the story takes place over a period of four or five years, the characters keep having to announce that a year has past between scenes to explain gaps in the story's logic. And repeatedly segments of the film begin with characters announcing their undying passion and ending with them angrily breaking up, squeezing days or weeks of reality into a few minutes of unconvincing, heightened melodrama. Such artificial manipulation of time is understandable in a play, but unnecessary and irritating in a film which pretends to take place in the real world. It is possible that director Mike Nichols was purposely trying to mislead the audience about the timing of events in order to make a point, but what that point might be is unclear.To give them credit, the actors do what they can with so little to work with. Their characters are one-dimensional at best and clichÃ©d at worst. (Marber's idea of originality is making Portman's waif-like character a stripper, rather than a prostitute. Wow, how daring!) At least Roberts endows her character with a consistent tone, albeit one of somber self-absorption; I guess there is a certain triumph for her in being able to suppress under a cloud of chilly aloofness all that warm charisma that has made her a star. Meanwhile, Portman, Law and Owen have to somehow make their characters sudden shifts in attitude and temperament credible, with varying degrees of success. All are at the mercy of Marber's empty, loveless pessimism.Mike Nichols is one heck of a director and he has a quartet of perfectly capable actors at his command for this film. And he has trod this path before with films like WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (a great movie) and CARNAL KNOWLEDGE (an overrated movie), so he has experience in turning theatrical artifice into credible cinema. But those films had complex stories and even more complex characters (and arguably, much better actors). Here all Nichols has is Marber's adaptation of his own 'award-winning play,' which presumably has lost something in the translation. As a result, the closer you look, the less there is to see.",2,1,4,21 December 2004
Taxi Driver," Dead end streets...
","Travis Bickle is the sort of person you wouldn't even see if you encountered him on the street -- and if you did take note of him, you would make a point to ignore him. He is a non-entity. In his role as a cabbie, you would be aware of him only in the same way you would notice the color of the upholstery or be aware of a strange smell inside the cab. On the rare occasion that Travis might make his presence felt, you would tolerate his existence -- maybe even graciously acknowledge him with a smile or a noncommittal comment. You would only remember Travis if he said or did something particularly rude or offensive or bizarre; and then only as long as you might remember what you had for lunch or what your horoscope said.There is no reason to remember, or to feel bad about not remembering, a Travis Bickle because he has no real effect on your life. He does a job, he fills a space; just like millions of other anonymous everyday workers. But the sad thing about Travis is that he has no real effect on anyone. Most people have a life -- family, friends, interests, a purpose beyond being part of the machinery. Travis only has a job. You would not notice Travis, but Travis might notice you. And judge you: He might decide that you are part of what makes life worth tolerating, but more likely he might see you as part of what makes the world an unbearable hell. It is the nature of film that when it casts an eye toward the 'little guy,' the attempt is to show that the ordinary man has something extraordinary about him that society is missing -- even if that is just an everyday niceness. This being a Martin Scorsese film, written by Paul Schrader, filmmakers with a near-suicidal view of mankind, the point of TAXI DRIVER is just the opposite. If Travis Bickle is a remarkable person in any sense, it is in a negative way. Travis is not a good man; he is petty and mean-spirited and bigoted and self-absorbed and judgmental. He views the world with contempt; he has to, he has to have more hate for the world than he has for himself. TAXI DRIVER is the story of a man living the proverbial life of quite desperation. In self-imposed isolation, Travis is mentally unstable, and probably was long before the film starts. The film supposedly is loosely based on THE SEARCHERS, but it has much more in common with PSYCHO. Travis, like Norman Bates hides his insanity behind a facade of banality and nurses it with his loneliness. Insignificant men with a significant amount of pent up anger. The main difference -- and it is a telling difference -- is that we don't see Norman's rage until the end, it takes us by surprise; while we never doubt that Travis has inner demons. What Travis does is a foregone conclusion. Paul Schrader's dark, oppressive script pointedly refers to Travis as a walking contradiction, often at the cost of the story's credibility. He's not particularly bright and at times almost shockingly slow, but his journal entries are surprisingly articulate. He declares a woman to be 'an angel,' but is dismayed that she is offended by being taken to a porno film. He claims to have an honorable discharge from the marines, yet he seems to have been born yesterday, not even knowing the meaning of a common phrase like 'moonlighting.' Schrader's superficial screenplay is long on obscenities and racial slurs, but short on simple logic. The shortcomings of the script are offset to a great degree by solid performances and Scorsese's stylish direction. As Travis, Robert DeNiro is in virtually every scene and even though the screenplay falters at various times, DeNiro holds the film together with a consistency of tone and insight. Forgoing his usual bombastic method posturing (during most of the film), DeNiro plays Travis with a compassion that makes this otherwise horrid little man pitiable, if not sympathetic. He makes us care for Travis, even though the story offers us no real reason to. Jodie Foster, playing the child prostitute to whom Travis hopes to play savior, still has the youthful freshness and wise innocence that made her a treasure as a child actress. (Though I have trouble respecting Scorsese for casting a 13-year-old child, even one as mature and worldly as Foster, in a part that is so squalid and degrading.) Scorsese sees in Travis' New York City a teeming cesspool, but with cinematographer Michael Chapman, he makes it the most photogenic cesspool imaginable. He doesn't romanticize New York, but he does romanticize Travis' seething hatred of the city. However, he does wisely counterpoint Travis grubby view of the world with a sense of a real world, where friends and coworkers joke and talk and, well, exist. Unlike RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS and CASINO, Scorsese films where psychotic characters exist in closed worlds where their lunatic behavior seems the norm, TAXI DRIVER underscores Travis' outsider status by giving us a realistic world that he is isolated from. As such, TAXI DRIVER has an honesty that his other violent epics lack.But Scorsese provides us with at least two scenes that ring utterly false. His own gratuitous cameo as a passenger graphically boasting of his plans to murder his wife seems to be Scorsese's way of showing that there are people who are even crazier than Travis. Why? To suggest that Travis is justified in his paranoia? Also the final climatic bloodbath provided only a cheap shock at the time and now seems like a tiresome cliché of special effects gore. Such over the top mayhem doesn't underscore the brutality of the violence, it trivializes the rest of the film. TAXI DRIVER, like DeNiro's performances, is best in its still moments of quiet desperation.The irony of the violence is that it eventually makes Travis famous, though it could have just as easily have made him infamous. The bullets that kill the pimp could have killed the politician. In Travis' mind they are pretty much the same. Unfortunately, I don't think some people get that. Travis, in the end, is not a hero, he is a murder. He is not purged of his demons; they are just temporarily placated. The famed 'you talking' to me?' scene has reached iconic status, symbolic of tough-guy cool -- not unlike Dirty Harry's 'Make my day.' But both Travis and Harry are dangerous icons; filmgoers delude themselves into accepting their insane displays of violence because the right make-believe characters get killed. They are protected by the fantasy of film; in the real world they would eventually be revealed to be the monsters. To his credit, Scorsese at least suggests that in the end Travis Bickle is still insane, and armed and dangerous. Even so, the ending is uncomfortably ambiguous: I don't think that Scorsese is as afraid of Travis' insanity as he is in awe of it.",8,15,31,28 June 2004
Capote," Based on Tru events ...
","'People like that, who cozy up to artists, do so at their own risk,' or says Truman Capote as played by Robert Morse in 'Tru,' the one-man show written by Jay Presson Allen. And that also seems to be the history lesson in CAPOTE.Truman Capote was introduced to the mass public as a winsome child, as a character in 'A Christmas Memory,' a famed TV special based on the author's childhood recollections of growing up poor and under the guidance of his eccentric Aunt Sookie. For others, he is the sophisticated wit behind works like 'Breakfast at Tiffany's.' Though most, no doubt, remember Capote as a jaded celebrity, a toothless monster on talk shows, known for his bitchy attitude and acid tongue attacks on those he counted among his jet-setting peers. It is the loss of innocence that took him to that last stage of his career that CAPOTE is all about.CAPOTE deals with what the author had to do to make the transition from literary darling to full-fledge celebrity, a brand name more famous than his actual accomplishments. Whether that was fulfilling his destiny or selling his soul is sort of left up to the viewer to decide.The catalyst for the change occurred far removed from Capote's high-toned Manhattan society world. On the plains of Kansas in 1958, a farm family of four was violently murdered. The killings of the Clutter family barely made a blip on the map for most Americans, but Capote saw it as material for what he would call a nonfiction novel. Though why such a project would be considered ground breaking is odd, since turning true crime into pulp fiction is a tradition dating back even before the dime novels of the old west. Anyway, the result was 'In Cold Blood,' a novel that gave literary prestige to penny dreadful literature.The implication is that Capote was pioneering this new form of journalism in which the author becomes personally involved with his subject, though writers getting chummy with (and betraying) their sources is a journalistic tradition almost as old as the printing press. The key difference in Capote's case is that he didn't consider himself a journalist or even a historian, but rather an artist wanting to apply fiction writing techniques to true events. That seems to be hair splitting of the narrowest of strands, not to mention a way of sidestepping a few ethical standards, most importantly, objectivity.Anyway, Perry Smith and Richard Hickock were spared from being mere minor footnotes in the annals of crime by Capote, who ultimately focused his novel on the criminals and not the their crime, or their victims. And the film implies that Capote, if he didn't fall in love with Smith, at least developed a deep affection for him. Whether this is true, it certainly makes for good drama. Capote befriends the two killers while also lying to them and feeding them false hopes, all to exploit their wretched lives and sanctioned deaths for literary glory. CAPOTE suggests that as he promised to do his best to save the killers' lives, he not so secretly grew impatient for their executions so his book would have a good ending. Fact, it seems, wasn't conforming to his fiction fast enough. The film puts forth that Capote's eventual physical, emotional and literary decline stems from the moral choices he made to get his story, selling his soul, as it were -- though various addictions, including being a fame junkie, probably were greater factors.As with 'In Cold Blood,' one must wonder if CAPOTE is journalism, biographical history or simply nonfiction fiction? Like 'In Cold Blood' we have to trust that there is honesty buried within its artistic license; where facts end and good storytelling commences is never clear under the best of circumstances. When the author's motives are suspect, the border probably doesn't exist at all. And getting history to fit on a movie screen further confuses the issue. CAPOTE must be taken with a grain of salt -- it is 'based on true events,' an indirect way of saying that truth has been bent to suit the story -- or the whims of the filmmakers. As fiction, CAPOTE is an admirable production. Dan Futterman's screenplay covers a lot of years and territory with precision and style and it is matched by Bennett Miller's moody direction. But the best element of the film, and its greatest illusion, is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's remarkable incarnation. The rather imposing actor not only mimics Capote's grating little voice, but also physically takes on the diminutive guise of the elfish author. It is a dead-on impersonation, but also a complex performance of a character whose comically nondescript presence hides considerable arrogance, manipulation and pettiness. It is not a flattering portrayal by any means.To its credit, the film itself takes exception with the notion that art is its own justification. The popular assumption that in art -- and journalism -- the end justifies the means is challenged; the film questions if finding some vague artistic truth overrides sacrificing honesty or the loss of ethical standards. Whether the filmmakers practiced what they preached may be another question to consider.But, at least, CAPOTE has purpose, being about a person of note; compared to Capote's own novel, which indirectly legitimizes the lives of two men whose only act of consequence was the cold-blooded slaughter of four innocent people during a bungled robbery. As with 'In Cold Blood,' CAPOTE casts a more curious eye on the two killers, than on the poor Clutter family. And despite the fact that Capote grew up in rural America like the Clutters, the irony is that he seems to identify with the predators more than the prey. Or maybe that is just what the filmmakers see, as they portray the author as a predator of a different sort.",7,3,6,15 January 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," From rags to witches ...
","To the vast number of people of the world, what is called 'high fashion' is nothing more than a trivial pursuit for the very rich and very gullible. It is an industry devoted to spending huge sums of money to create exotic, often hideous, clothing that few can afford and even fewer can actually wear. But according to various characters in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, fashion isn't so much of an industry as it is an art form. And not just the design and the creation of the clothing itself, but its presentation in word and image, as well as its promotion as a means of shaping and advancing a culture. Like some sort of stylistic Reaganomics, the god-awful million-dollar gowns and garments being pasted onto stick-figure models on the runways of Paris and Milan today may someday, eventually, have some effect on what average Americans will happily buy off the clearance rack at Wal-mart.Maybe. Maybe not.But THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA does seem to suggest two things with reasonable confidence. One, the people involved in the fashion industry do totally believe that what they do is important and that minor details such as the hue of a blouse or the hem line of a skirt has meaningful consequences. And two, those who control the industry are so rarefied and isolated from reality that they can't comprehend just how meaningless those consequences really are.The backdrop for PRADA is Runway magazine, a Vogue-like industry bible ruled with cold-blooded self-assurance by editor Miranda Priestly (brilliantly played with self-assured cold-bloodedness by Meryl Streep). The goal of the magazine it would seem is to visually strive for female perfection and if that isn't enough the magazine also prides itself on featuring the works of celebrated writers and photographers. Curiously, when a magazine such as Playboy defends its existence, it will be in defense of the search for female perfection, with the works of celebrated writers and photographers tossed in for good measure. Clothed or unclothed, do we seem to have competing styles of pornography at play? Who is objectifying women more? At least Playboy is thrifty enough to forego the cost of expensive wardrobes.To some extent, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is a remake (a designer knockoff?) of the 1957 musical FUNNY FACE, wherein bookworm Audrey Hepburn finds herself transformed into a butterfly by almost accidentally being seduced into the superficial world of high fashion by photographer Fred Astaire. This time around it's Anne Hathaway; she plays a wannabe journalist who rather unbelievably finds herself to be the second assistant to Streep's maven of style. Arguably, PRADA could have been about any business, since the focus of the story is on dehumanizing corporate ethics, the downsizing of personal integrity and other issues dealt with previously in films from EXECUTIVE SUITE and THE APARTMENT to NETWORK and SWIMMING WITH SHARKS. But by placing PRADA in a world primarily ran by and catering to women (and a few gay men), the film challenges the naive notion that women would do it all so much differently if they were in power. And tellingly, for a film about fashion, it offers precious few glimpses of style, beauty or elegance, the very elements with which the characters justify their existence. Hard edged and icy, PRADA has more in common with David Mamet's brutal GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS than with the joyous glamour of Stanley Donen's FUNNY FACE; no one so much as hums a Gershwin tune.PRADA's focus is on Hathaway, who as the lamb among the wolves learns the value of being a sheep in wolf's clothing -- though admittedly, the wolves dress quite well. But just as Priestly sets the style and the tone of the fashion world, that job falls to Streep in the movie. Streep manages to be coolly hilarious and coldly horrifying, creating a career-woman monster that falls somewhere between Martha Stewart and Cruella De Vil -- not that that is such a wide gap. A part that could have been played quite successfully as broad comedy (think Sigourney Weaver in WORKING GIRL), instead is granted surprising depth by Streep, even though she barely changes facial expressions throughout. When the character so much as flirts with being sympathetic or vulnerable, Streep summarily discards such emotions as if they were particularly unflattering rhinestone accessories. Unlike this season's collection, her performance will be a perennial favorite, one not likely to soon go out of fashion.",8,0,0,11 July 2006
The Aviator," Ahead in the clouds...
","When it comes to filmed biographies, I set a simple standard. For me the minimum expectation in seeing a film biography is that, in the end, I walk away with the feeling that I have met someone worth meeting. Just because the subject of the film is famous or important won't impress me; the film has to prove that that person should be important to me.I mean, when I left the film MELVIN AND HOWARD, a slice-of-life comedy about Melvin Dumar whose brief encounter with celebrity gave him his 15 minutes of fame, I was exhilarated; the film introduced me to someone unique, someone I was glad I met, no matter how fleeting the meeting or fleeting his fame. On the other hand, when I walked out of RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS, two wildly overpraised bios by Martin Scorsese, my honest reaction was 'So what?' Jake LaMotta and Henry Hill were of no interest to me before those films and are of even less interest to me now. And nothing Scorsese did stylistically within those films made those characters in any way interesting. I think RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS are lousy movies because those characters did not touch me in anyway.Now here is Scorsese, the maker of those two films, directing a biopic about Howard Hughes, the Howard in MELVIN AND HOWARD. The film does have one thing in its favor immediately: Hughes was one fascinating individual, so it would seem almost impossible to make an uninteresting film about him. Though, one would have to overlook THE CARPETBAGGERS, the silly 1962 soap opera loosely based on Hughes' life; and to take into account that the subject of THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ was also an incredible individual, yet Scorsese managed to do a total hatched job on him.THE AVIATOR suffers from the same problem as most biopics: too much story, too much man, too much legend and too little time. Who he was competes for screen time with what he did. Even as it pushes toward three hours, it barely touches upon the influence that the man had. A whole film could have been made just about his dabbling in movie making. But the film does a great job at targeting the highlights of his early life and using those moments to illustrate his advancing state of mental illness. And even then, the film seems incomplete as it ends his story long before the intensity of Hughes' mental illness took control of his life. Ironically, the film takes on too much of his life and yet doesn't cover enough of it.Perhaps the most interesting thing about THE AVIATOR is that it a sympathetic story about a multimillionaire. Indeed the film's advertising sells it as a man-against-the-system success story, even though the battles he fights are largely designed to consolidate his power and increase his wealth. What Hughes does in the film seems neither more nor less ruthless, reckless and/or self-centered than any of his adversaries. He was, it would seem, born into wealth; lived the life of a spoiled playboy, noted for his numerous affairs; and excelled at being an aggressive businessman, not above hostile takeovers. Just the sort of character that Hollywood loves to hate. The film could have easily painted a very cruel and negative picture of Hughes, but, perhaps because of his mental illness -- or perhaps because, like Scorsese, Hughes was an obsessive filmmaker -- the story is at the very least respectful of the man and his accomplishments.At first Leonard DiCaprio seems far too young to play Hughes, especially as the prevailing image of Hughes is either that of an older man in his prime or as an old man, stewing in the decay of his own mental illness and the cocoon of wealth. But DiCaprio does a remarkable job of showing us that Hughes had a youth, that he was an angry, aggressive young man of considerable ambition and a degree of genius. And DiCaprio takes Hughes past the stages of callow youth and into the physical and mental decline of a wounded warrior. One hopes that DiCaprio will revisit the character in a decade or two to explore the second half of the millionaire's eccentric life. There is more to be told and DiCaprio seems to have the talent to see this man's life through. DiCaprio's efforts are only overshadowed by Cate Blanchett's scene-stealing turn as a strong-willed and tough-minded Katharine Hepburn.If I have any real problem with THE AVIATOR it is that it does seem to adhere to the standard biopic blueprint of this-happened-that-happened. The story might have been better approached in the style of CITIZEN KANE, juggling the past with the present, telling the story from various viewpoints. After all, Hughes was a Kane-like figure: powerful, ruthless, kind, self-important and contradictory. KANE's message was that you can't really get to know a man; THE AVIATOR seems to think it knows its subject a little too well. But as is, the film is a solid and entertaining piece of stylish and colorful film-making. It takes off and stays aloft until the end.",7,2,4,13 February 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss American Beauty ...
","The film LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE builds, not surprisingly, to the 'Little Miss' beauty pageant of the title. As the pageant unfolds, we -- I guess -- are suppose to be appalled by the sight of little girls strutting around on stage doing make-believe provocative routines, while dressed in sorta sexually suggestive clothes. Yet, when the film's little protagonist, Olive Hoover, takes the stage dressed like Diane Keaton in ANNIE HALL, but does a dance routine more like Demi Moore in STRIPTEASE (while 'Super Freak' plays in the background!), we -- I guess -- are supposed to be amused by how cute she is. Am I missing something here? Why do the filmmakers take such a condescending view of child beauty pageants, with the implications that the participants are being somehow exploited, yet they seem to celebrate when their little darling behaves in a manner that is infinitely more tasteless? After I finished watching LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE the first time, my reaction was a shrug and a 'So what!' I didn't see what all the fuss was about. This R-rated 'family' comedy just didn't seem like all that much to me. Plus, as the weeks passed and I thought about it more, the less I could remember about any of it that was even just okay. After seeing it a second time, the thought of the film just flat-out gives me the creeps. It is like someone took a nice banal and benign Disney film and did everything they could to dirty it up, while trying to retain a thin veneer of it being sweet and innocent. Ironically, as the film seems to condemn beauty pageants for making something sleazy out of something cute, that is exactly what the filmmakers do with their story. A slight tale about an ugly duckling hoping to be a swan ends up having the moral that 'life is just one f*****g beauty pageant after another!' That's not how I remember Hans Christian Andersen phrasing it.There is never a moment in the film where the heavy hand of contrivance doesn't manipulate the actions of all involved. For some illogical reason, little Miss Olive is at the last minute notified that she can compete in the title beauty pageant, despite the fact she lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico and the pageant seems to be a local event in Southern California. Because the plot hinges on it, the entire family is forced to go to the event, all piling into a beat up, old VW minibus that has 'phony plot gimmick' written all over it. What follows is a series of scenes where nobody seems to like each other, but where the story stops regularly to show just how much they really, really, really love each other. Yawn!I guess we are suppose to find this dysfunctional bunch adorable. Abigail Breslin is cute enough as the 10-year-old wannabe beauty queen and Steve Carell does well as gay Uncle Frank, though just what point is being served by making him a suicidal depressive is not obvious. And with heavyhanded irony, the film makes it clear that step-dad Richard (Greg Kennear) is a motivational speaker whose positive thinking theories for success clearly don't work for him. Toni Colette is given the thankless job of being the almost-invisible mother. And it says something about this family that brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is fifteen and no one has yet to notice that he is color blind and can't tell red from green. Don't these people even celebrate Christmas? No wonder the kid is angry and has taken a vow of silence.But the film stretches its creep factor to the limit with Grandpa Edwin; played by Alan Arkin, Grandpa would be nothing more than the stereotype of a cantankerous foul-mouthed old coot accept that he is also a heroin user and has a porn habit -- both of which he indulges on this family outing. This is the filmmakers' idea of charming. When we find out that sex-obsessed Grandpa is apparently Olive's frequent babysitter and pageant coach, the thought of Grandpa locked away with Olive in the basement, high on drugs as he teaches her how to shake her groove thing and do a crowd-pleasing burlesque, should make your skin crawl. Even assuming that nothing funny is going on between Gramps and Olive, it says something that the filmmakers don't even recognize just how improper and unhealthy the idea appears to be. Do they actually think this is a typical American Family?The only fascinating thing about the film is that it was one of the most critically praised films of 2006, despite its fake sentimentality, contrived plot twists and sleazy dishonesty. I can only assume that its mean streak has somehow been mistaken for satirical bite.There is a smug and demeaning attitude that permeates this entire film, yet there is little justification apparent for the film or its makers to, in any way, feel superior. It's rancid cynicism doesn't even make the film hip and cool, or even dark and thought-provoking. Being no more a 'feel good' family comedy than AMERlCAN BEAUTY was an honest look at the middle class, the film is shallow and crude and just not very nice. I suppose screenwriter Michael Arndt thinks he is making a bold statement about our competitive society, but what that may be is hard to see. The film ends with officials trying to yank little Olive off the stage, only to have her entire family join her to show their support for her mock striptease, disrupting the entire pageant. The message seems to be if you can't win, then ruin it for everyone else. It scores no point for congeniality either.",2,8,17,10 February 2007
American Beauty," Anti-American Beauty
","They live in the suburbs, therefore they are losers.That is the sum total of the wisdom imparted by this dreary, pointless and joyless satire of middle-class America, circa 1998. The amazing thing about the film is that the filmmakers (and apparently many in the audience) think this film is bursting with original ideas and deep insights. When in reality, this is a tired retread of antiestablishment cliches from the sixties. The only difference is that films as diverse as DIVORCE AMERICAN STYLE to THE PRESIDENT'S ANALYST to THE GUIDE FOR THE MARRIED MAN to I LOVE YOU, ALICE B. TOKLAS knew how to instill the material with pathos, despair and anger and still show a flair for the wickedly funny and bitingly satirical. AMERICAN BEAUTY is a mean, bitter and shallow examination of people who are mean, bitter and shallow. While those films were daring and fresh, BEAUTY is stale and dirty.Kevin Spacey plays the overworked, under appreciated middle-class corporate drone who drops out of the rat race due to a severe case of the middle-age crazies. Unfortunately, he may be out of the race, but he remains a rat. As played with smarmy snugness by Spacey, the character of Lester Burnham seeks, not inner peace, but self gratification. After resorting to blackmail to get his corporate freedom, he spends his newfound leisure time lusting after his teenaged daughter's cheerleader friend, berating his wife, experimenting with drugs and just generally being obnoxious. Spacey's much praised performance is largely without nuance or heart; a less sympathetic depiction of an 'everyman' would be hard to come by.Despite the film's supposed antiestablishment slant and vaguely pro-drugs attitude, the film hardly embraces liberalism. The film is not only antifeminist, but anti-woman as well, portraying Lester's wife (played by the otherwise wonderful Annette Benning) as a shrieking, materialistic shrike. (How dare she find capitalism and the suburbs to her liking!) The other women are mere sex objects. And despite the fact that several of the filmmakers are openly gay, the film is condescendingly homophobic as well: The gay guys next door are used as a joke and when a villain is needed for the finale, out trots the neighborhood closet case.Good satire says 'This is us, aren't we something!' Bad satire says 'This is them, aren't they pathetic!' AMERICAN BEAUTY goes beyond bad satire. The filmmakers make no attempt to conceal their contempt for the American middle class, a group they obviously view with no respect, no sympathy or even a shred of affection. They do, however, seem to respect their moviegoing dollars.The film's tagline was 'Look closer!' A bold invitation, considering just how little clothes this emperor is wearing.",2,10,20,24 March 2004
Ocean's Eleven," Crime pays
","Since movies these days seem to be made primarily by talent agencies making deals and special effects experts making explosions, it is nice and even refreshing that this troop got together to make a film that wants nothing more than to entertain. I have seen several reviews attacking the film because it has nothing serious to say and attacking the director for, well, selling out because he opted to make a film that is just fun. This is like criticizing a lemon pie because it doesn't taste like apples. This is a good old-fashioned caper movie made by a bunch of talented people who want to share that fun with the audience. That is not selling out. It is a great movie? No. But it is a good one and in year that gave us such dreadful heist films as The Score and Sexy Beast, it certainly is a credit to its genre.",7,0,2,8 December 2001
Quantum of Solace," 'Another way to die. Shoot 'em, bang bang!'
","You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how QUANTUM OF SOLACE rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: QUANTUM OF SOLACE: A bad title? No, a terrible title. And naming the evil organization that Bond is trying to uncover 'Quantum' doesn't help. Now 'Quantum of Evil' would be a nifty title, because, really, what solace can be found in organized crime. Whatever – is it even worth discussing? 0 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: A long and chaotic car chase along the Italian countryside opens the film, but accomplishes little beyond destroying Bond's Astin Martin. It is elaborately staged, but the rapid cutting and maddening pace makes it more confusing than exciting. (Note to director: If you are staging a car chase, choose cars that look different, so that viewers can follow the action better. Or better yet, edit for clarity, with pace and rhythm, not just unending flashes of violence. Great action scenes are based on suspense and dramatic counterpoint, not just mindless speed.) 4 points.Opening Credits: Gone are the elegant and/or sexy and/or silly montages of the classic Bond films, replaced by computer generated images of deserts and slow-motion bullets; it is slick in execution, but amateurish and mindless in concept. 5 points.Theme Song: Entitled 'Another Way to Die' (which would be a better title for the entire film), the opening song is a jittery little tune with a vague rap flavor to it. Unfortunately, it suffers from nonsense lyrics that have no flow, tell no story or even relate to the movie itself. Still, it might have worked okay had it been performed with a slinky sexuality as a pseudo love ballad, rather than in a nursery rhyme style by Alicia Keys and the composer Jack White. The song improves with repeated listenings, but still misses the mark. 7 points.'Bond, James Bond': Daniel Craig doesn't even utter Bond's signature phrase in this film, which is just as well because he is barely playing James Bond at all. Bond's witticisms and dry, ironic sense of humor are nowhere to be heard in QUANTUM, with Craig mumbling in a lifeless monotone behind a face that rarely changes from a grim mask of cold indifference. For all their attempts to make Bond into a 'real man,' all they have done is make him seem less human. Craig drains Bond of all of his humor and humanity and makes one long for the days of Sean Connery. Heck, he makes you long for Timothy Dalton. 2 points.Bond Babes: As the sacrificial Bond Girl #2, Gemma Arterton (as Strawberry Fields), is given little opportunity to be sexy, but manages to be alluring anyway, in a crisp, professional fashion. But other than being easily seduced by Bond and just as casually disposed of by the film, she has little to do. Olga Kurylenko as Camille, a feisty femme fatale, manages to inject a bit of honest energy into the film, though her repeated attempts to hook up with the film's villain, even as he repeatedly tries to killer her, makes her come off as being a bit stupid. But then, how else could Bond repeatedly show up to save her? Olga is a strong character and is nicely played by Kurylenko, but the clumsy screenplay betrays her at every turn. 9 points.Bond Villain: Looking like Howdy Doody's evil twin, Mathieu Amalric plays Dominic Greene, a philanthropic environmentalist, whose environmentally friendly projects are a disguise for his fiendish plot to corner the world's water supply. It is not one of the series most believable plots. As for Amalric, he plays the role with a subtle nastiness that is a couple of notches below the point where the character would actually be colorful. Supposedly, the filmmakers didn't want Greene to have any distinctive gimmicks or characteristics that would make him larger than life, the better to show how banal evil can be. Instead, they have made him smaller than life, and showed just how uninteresting evil can be. 5 points.Bond Baddies: The days of Oddjob, Jaws, Baron Samedi and Nick Nack are apparently long gone. Instead we get nameless, faceless stunt men who all look alike and act alike and indulge in elaborately choreographed fights scenes that rely on hysterical editing. Boring. 0 points.Sinister Plot: Meant to be a direct sequel to CASINO ROYALE, the plot line – as they repeatedly have to tell us – concerns Bond's attempt to avenge the death of his last lover Vesper Lynn. Just how that ties into the rest of the film is never made clear, coherency not being the film's strong suit. 5 points.Production values: Like all Bond films, the action takes place at various locations around the world. Unlike other Bond films, you get no sense of having been at various locations around the world. There is no attempt get Bond to interact with the local atmosphere, only screen titles announcing that the setting has changed to another place. This is the shortest Bond film of them all, apparently because director Marc Forster decided to cut out anything that slowed the action: humor, atmosphere, character development, romance, etc. As a result, the film is almost as generic as it is anemic. This might not be the worst Bond film of all time, but it certainly is the dullest. 2 points.Bonus Points: No Q. No Moneypenny. No extra points.Summary: The film does the barest minimum to get the job done.Bond-o-meter Rating: 39 points out of 100",4,3,5,26 March 2009
No Country for Old Men," No answers to key questions
","When some movies are over, everything is tied up in a neat little package; for better or worse, someone worked really hard to make sure there were no unanswered questions. Other movies aren't so considerate. Others may be messy, but the good ones leave you asking key questions about the philosophy of the story. They may make you wonder 'What would I do in that situation?' 'Was the hero really a hero?' 'Do I agree with the film's moral?' etc. These films draw you into the story, to the point where the ending is really the beginning of the film's lasting power. Sometimes messy is good.Bad ones, however, leave you questioning the story itself: 'Why did he do that?' 'What happened to so-and-so?' 'Did that make any sense?' 'What did I miss?' Such films make you see the holes in the plot, not the story that surrounds them. When the film is a huge critical or commercial success, the pertinent question may well be 'So, what's the big deal?' NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a 'so-what's-the-big-deal' type of movie. It is undoubtedly THE film of 2007, an Oscar-winning, critic's choice, top ten darling. Yet, for the most part, it is an utterly conventional modern day western; so predictable that Charles Bronson could be resurrected from the grave and plopped down into the middle of it without missing a beat. It is adequately directed and decently acted, but otherwise -- for the first two-thirds -- it is largely without distinction. Perhaps, because the filmmakers work so hard to seem unconventional in the last third, the defenders think they see something unique in the whole.The set up is routinely plotted: A poor, but relatively honest young man, while hunting in the west Texas desert, stumbles on a drug deal gone bad. While callously rooting around amidst the dead bodies, he helps himself to over two million dollars in illicit cash. He takes off and is soon pursued by a relentless, but relatively insane mob assassin -- and they are both -- sorta -- pursued by an honest, but relatively ineffectual local marshal. Leaving a predictable trail of dead bodies along the way, the film seems to be promising a confrontation where any two or more of the protagonists should face each other in a traditional showdown.At least, that is how the writing/directing team of Joel and Ethan Coen set things up. It could be argued that Coen brothers are playing around with the audience, mischievously creating expectations that they have no intentions of meeting. But in side-stepping the obvious tried and true plot twists and dramatic confrontations that such a climax normally would offer, the Coens don't really replace them with anything better. The last third of NO COUNTRY is shocking and challenging only because it is so vapid and devoid of drama. Characters die off-camera with only the vaguest explanation, while other characters' fates are left an obtuse mystery. The finale peters out into three separate and pointless conclusions: the thief dies, the killer apparently gets away and the policeman quits, never to cross each other's paths. And the audience isn't given much reason to care about any of them.The anemic narrative wouldn't matter so much, I suppose, if the film were instead a incisive or compelling study of one or more of the characters. Though the actors give decent enough performances, they can't flesh out the characters beyond ciphers. Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss, the hunter turned thief, is a solid presence, a modern day twist on the iconic figure of the strong, silent and resourceful cowboy. But beyond the good-boy-gone-bad tradition of the western, the film gives Llewelyn little backstory and no particular depth beyond being both foolish and yet smarter than one would expect. Ed Tom Bell, the gruff, world-weary, retirement-bound, small-town sheriff, is played by Tommy Lee Jones as a safe and comfortable stereotype; only denied by the uninspired script either the traditional age-cultivated wisdom or the opportunity to be even vaguely heroic. He spends most of the film wistfully longing for the good old days.Javier Bardem's much praised work as the tiresomely inscrutable and indestructible hit-man Anton Chigurh is largely a one-note performance -- Oscar win notwithstanding. His persistence, in lieu of any personality, has been inexplicable interpreted as having mythic dimensions as the embodiment of cruel fate or death incarnate. Only desperation to find meaning in the slight story justifies such heavy-handed symbolism. Lumbering through the film with all the emotional complexity of a slasher movie serial killer, Chigurh is little more than a lazy gimmick; with his over-sized weapons (one requires he lug around a 30-pound tank of compressed air!) and arbitrary flip-a-coin sadism, he is a ludicrous character who survives only due to the manipulations of a generously contrived script.But, it is no wonder the film focuses on Chigurh, who like Coens' films, embodies a cold, dispassionate emptiness. It is not that they don't do compassion (let alone passion) well, they don't even try. In their best effort, BLOOD SIMPLE, the chill of their drama is counteracted with a coy air of satire. Even FARGO is unpleasantly empty as far as emotional depth. You can tell a lot about filmmakers by how they treat even their minor and incidental characters; most characters in Coen films are disposable plot devices. It is no wonder a key character is killed off screen; the Coens don't care about his fate and assume we shouldn't either.NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN builds to one of the least satisfying conclusions of all time. The film is ultimately riddled with gaps in logic and figure-it-out-for-yourself ambiguities; things that the audience may not need to see, but have a right to expect to experience as part of the drama. NO COUNTRY isn't just weak film-making, it is an act of bad faith. The final question facing the viewer might well be 'Is that it?'",3,34,56,29 February 2008
Batman Begins," Been there! Done Bat! ...
","Watching BATMAN, either the old TV show or the various blockbuster movies, there is a huge lapse in logic that is hard to get around; namely, how can anyone, even a millionaire/billionaire like Bruce Wayne, amass all those gadgets and gizmos and superhero stuff and still maintain his secret identity? Okay, those gadgets in his utility belt aren't that big of a deal, assuming, of course, Bruce Wayne also happens to be a scientific genius. But how can you install a nuclear reactor in a cave under your mansion without somebody knowing it? Or custom build a Batmobile all by yourself? Superman and Spider-Man and the like are all pretty much self-contained superheroes, but The Batman, being human, has got to rely on a whole lot of other people to supply him with super gadgets. How could he trust all those people to keep his secret? BATMAN BEGINS tries to explain away such illogical gaps and, strangely enough, the explanations prove to be not all that interesting. For instance, basically all those wonderful toys seem to be army surplus junk that Wayne Enterprises couldn't palm off on the military. Okay, but oddly by supplying logical answers to Batman's mysteries, the film only seems to demystify the very mythology it is trying to perpetuate.Depending on one's point of view, BATMAN BEGINS is either a noble attempt to expand on the Batman legend, or like the STAR WARS prequel trilogy, a quiet, unwitting admission that the possibilities of the series have been milked dry. After over half the film illustrates the tedious exposition explaining how Batman came to be, the film becomes the standard superhero adventure, right up to the last minute confrontation with the villain and the saving of humanity.The film is exceedingly well made, but relies totally on formula: Bruce Wayne's early childhood trauma (check), his conversion to eastern mysticism/martial arts (check), his vow to fight evil (check), his confrontation with evil forces out to destroy Gotham City (check) -- check, check, check, etc., etc., etc. And do we really need yet another climatic chase through a major city where large chunks of real estate is wantonly destroyed, but where apparently no innocent lives are lost? For a film offering a new beginning, BATMAN BEGINS seems to suffer from a lot of been-there-done-that.To its credit, the film benefits greatly from the casting of Christian Bale as the young Bruce Wayne. As the other BATMAN films have shown, it is largely irrelevant who is in the Batsuit, since the character is largely played by a series of stunt men. But since most of this film deals with Bruce's metamorphosis, Bale has the talent to put a human face on the character of the millionaire playboy by being serious without being tiresomely intense, and still surprise the character with a bit of humor. Bale is backed by pros like Michael Caine (Alfred the butler), Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer and a surprisingly subdued Gary Oldman, all of whom are given little to do except give the film the credibility of their reliable presence.The film's villains, however, are problematic. Whether we are talking TV show or movie, in the past the villains have been the real star of the stories, with BATMAN pretty much playing straight man to whatever 'special guest villain' is hamming it up center stage. Here, Batman is the main character and the evil-doers he must vanquish almost seem like afterthoughts. Crime boss Falcone (Tom Wilkerson) isn't interesting at all and the possibilities of Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow are never even nearly realized. And while it is refreshing to cast Liam Neeson against type as the film's ultimate villain, I have to admit I never believed him or his band of ninja warriors were ever a real threat. Nor does his plot to destroy Gotham City even make sense, either in philosophical intent or criminal execution.The film wants to avoid the over-the-top Jim Carrey/Jack Nicholson theatrics of the previous movies, but to what end? Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul doesn't quite measure up to the level of a James Bond villain, let alone rate being worthy of facing off against a comic book superhero. And having the final confrontation aboard a runaway elevated trains dares unfavorable comparisons to a similar action sequence in SPIDER-MAN II.Showing little of the imagination of his work in MEMENTO and INSOMNIA, Christopher Nolan's direction is efficient and largely effective, if not inventive. He seems to be going for a degree of realism, far removed from both the campiness of the TV series and the nightmare gloom that plagued the Burton/Schumacher series of films. Either way, the film seems to be playing it safe, obviously avoiding any risk that might threaten the studio's hope of turning the franchise into another cash cow franchise.",7,1,3,5 July 2005
Cars," Make and model citizens
","The sad reality is that the great American car has lost the one thing that made it most appealing: personality. Even as their commercials brag about the 'distinctive styling' of this model or that one, it is painfully obvious that from the late sixties on, most cars look pretty much alike. Forced to shed their fins and their chrome and even their bumpers, little by little automobiles have become stylistically interchangeable, save for a Gremlin here or a P.T. Cruiser there being bold enough to stand out from the crowd.I suspect that we have an entire generation of children who did not get to grow up looking at the new fall models and fantasizing about how human they looked. With wide radiator smiles, bearing chrome-plated teeth, and round, bulging headlight eyes with hypnotic stares, each car represented a sinister visage of devilish adventure or a teasing grin of motorized freedom. Today, look at the front of most cars and they resemble nothing more than a dead fish -- small gaping radiator mouths with flat, dead streamlined headlight eyes. Even models that have been resurrected from the dead -- the Ford Thunderbird and the Volkswagen Beetle -- are less reborn than merely zombified shells of their former selves, stripped down to banality.Therefore, it is not all that surprising that most of the stars of Pixar's CARS are older models, representing bits and pieces of our automotive past. The premise of this animated fantasy is that the world has evolved so that the human and the motorized are now one and the automobiles that rule have both human personalities and human-like dexterity. In the story, racecar Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is a superstar jock whose arrogant self-absorption is tested when he detours off the interstate onto the famed Route 66 and is forced to experience life in the slow lane. In the dusty, yet folksy and conveniently culturally diverse, desert town of Radiator Springs, he meets a variety of vehicles who teach him the meaning of life. It's sort of THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS meets Frank Capra. The film's message about stopping to smell the gas fumes isn't exactly Detroit fresh -- we've traveled this road before.So the film is less about story and more about personality. And Radiator Springs certainly isn't short on personality, albeit stereotypical personalities. The local tow truck (a '50's Chevy Cameo) is a country rube (Larry the Cable Guy); the town father is a gruff but wise '51 Hudson (Paul Newman); the spaced out 1960 VW hippie van has the hippy-dippy voice of George Carlin , etc. All the citizens of the town have distinct automotive stylings matched by distinct (and obvious) voices.Some of the casting in CARS is inspired, though, of course, one can quibble. For instance, with a name like Sally there must have been an impulse to cast a Ford Mustang in the role of Lightning's love interest. Certainly, lyrics like 'Mustang Sally, think you better slow your mustang down' would seem appropriate for one who down shifts from freeway to blacktop. Though perhaps there is a sexual subtext to the Wilson Pickett song that Pixar wished to avoid, thus Sally is a Porsche, even though she has the all-American voice of Bonnie Hunt. Likewise, while a sleek 1959 Chevrolet Impala is perfectly acceptable as the low-riding Ramón (Cheech Marin), a '58 model would have been far more photogenic. And there is much to be said for the distinctive styling of the 1951 Hudson Hornet as the retired racing great Doc, yet I think casting the role with an equally legendary '56 Chrysler 300 would have added a great deal more elegance and stature to the part.The role of Lightning is more problematic. Based vaguely on a Ford GT racer, the star of the film seems too generic; and maybe that is the point, that McQueen is so superficial his personality is no deeper than his pasted-on fake headlights. The film has the right idea when Lightning gets a temporary make over to resemble a 'Route 66'-styled Corvette. Indeed, Lightning McQueen would be so much more appealing played by a Corvette -- or a Shelby Cobra or a gullwing Mercedes Benz 300SL, or even a Volkswagen Beetle (but then his name would have to be changed to Herbie!).And then there is the controversy over windshield eyes versus headlight eyes. By placing the eyes in the windshield, Pixar, no doubt, made it easier for the animators to play with expressions. But, I think there is something creepy about having two peepers floating around inexplicably in a rectangular sea of white. It's like some alien form floating around in an automotive helmet. Plus, on many of the cars, you get the illusion of their being four eyes on the car's 'face.' This fleet of vehicles are undeniably cute, but Chevron's famous spokescars in their commercials had so much more personality.Though a tad too long, CARS is still worthy of a spin around the park. It is cute enough for kids and satirical enough for adults and it is steeped in an American Graffiti sense of nostalgia for a fading bit of the landscape. And it is sweetly devoid of road rage, taking the scenic route and not the cynic route.",8,0,3,19 June 2006
JFK," 'Who grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald?'
","As a dazzling display of film-making skill, you'd be hard pressed to find anything quite as efficient as Oliver Stone's JFK. As a document of history, the film falls far short. Using an array of film-making tricks and techniques Stone has created a long but engrossing tale, juggling dozens of remarkable characters and intertwining multiple stories and theories. The regrettable part is that in the end -- like in reality -- you don't know who or what to believe, which would be fine if that was Stone's conclusion. But in mixing reality and fantasy, archival footage and new footage, together to make them indistinguishable, Stone aims at presenting a solution to this great American mystery. Even granting the need for dramatic license, the film has serious issues when it comes to integrity. Just as you can't be just a little bit pregnant, you can't add just a little bit of fiction into fact and claim historical truth.The irony is that the very paranoia that fuels the film and inspired Stone to fully invest his talent is also the element that robs the film of credibility.Though Stone hedges his bets a bit by framing much of the story as supposition and presents reenactments of events that may or may not have really happened, the final conclusion that the audience is left with is that President Kennedy was the victim of a vast conspiracy consisting of the CIA, the Mafia, Fidel Castro, LBJ, an oddball band of communist sympathizers and a few odds and ends homosexuals, whose motives are never made clear. Just about everybody is culpable, except possibly Lee Harvey Oswald. By the time Stone's protagonist, the discredited and otherwise long-forgotten New Orleans prosecutor, Jim Garrison, gets Clay Shaw, a gay New Orleans business man, to trial on charges of conspiracy, the film itself seems to have lost all reason. Only the momentum of Stone's storytelling justifies the otherwise inexplicable trail that leads to Shaw.But, boy what storytelling it is. Cleverly using a cast of name actors -- a move that, no doubt, help get the film financed -- Stone gives identities to a huge collection of characters who might otherwise confuse the audience. This also gives credibility to his illusion of historical authenticity. Using the infamous Zapruder film as a centerpiece to his recreation of the assassination, the film takes on the air of a documentary.But it isn't a documentary. Much of his depiction of 'facts' is discredited theory, crackpot ideas and plain old everyday paranoia. For all of its brilliance, JFK never ties things together into a believable whole. One is apt to leave the film convinced of a conspiracy, but without any real evidence to back up the suspicions.An added irritation provided by Stone's view is that President John Kennedy is ultimately trivialized by the entire enterprise. Despite the title, Kennedy is almost a nonentity in the film. Though Stone suggests that it was Kennedy's supposed intent to pull out of the war in Vietnam that was the motive for his assassination, that all seems like a wild guess on Stone's part rather than an accepted fact. And Kennedy himself, no matter what his worth was as a world leader, a charismatic politician, a pop icon, a family man or a human being, is reduced to being little more than a human target in Stone's little world. I think Kennedy deserves better.",8,2,13,27 February 2004
The Incredibles," The Unremarkables...
","Though well made, sometimes very funny and imaginative, in the end THE INCREDIBLES could just as well be called The Unremarkables. While certainly a nice job is done by all, THE INCREDIBLES has the poor fortune to follow Pixar's other masterpieces to the screen and can't rise out of the shadows of the TOY STORY films, MONSTERS, INC. and FINDING NEMO. THE INCREDIBLES sets it sites higher than those films, as far as its outlandish story goes, but while its save-the-world adventure seems more grand in comparison to the seemingly mundane antics of the other films' miniature characters, the story comes off as being really rather ordinary. THE INCREDIBLES has really nothing new to offer, just an odd juxtaposition of old ideas and clichés from the two genres it grafts together. In tying together the world of the typical family sitcom with the premise of a routine superhero adventure, the film seeks originality, but the most remarkable thing about the film is that it shows that superhero tales have become just as mundane as your typical family sitcom. I think the magic of Pixar's previous efforts comes from more than just the wonderful artwork. Those films took us to other worlds or forced us to look at our world from a different perspective. THE INCREDIBLES goes from everyday suburbia to the inner sanctum of a mad genius out to control the world and the sad reality is that we have already been to the latter as often, if not more so, than the former. Saving the world is just not what it used to be; on the heels of James Bond, Spider-Man, Superman and an endless list of others, what The Incredibles do is old hat. And let's face it, in the toon world what these characters do is not that big of a deal either; from Bugs Bunny and Wiley Coyote to Goofy and Roger Rabbit, being indestructible and defying the laws of physics are pretty common tricks.Everything THE INCREDIBLES offers -- strength, speed, flexibility, invisibility -- has a been-there-done-that quality. All the classic cartoon characters were, to one extent or another, already superhuman.As such, superheroism in the toon world is a given; it is when the gifts that defy physics and common sense are endowed on real actors that the genre still has a sense of awe. When Christopher Reeve flies, when Tobey Maguire swings, when James Bond whips out Q's gadgets or Indiana Jones cracks his whip, the images still carry a kick -- men doing what cartoon characters take for granted. We can live vicariously through Superman or James Bond, but how often do we fantasize being Donald Duck or even Underdog?To me, the Incredibles' derring-do pales in comparison to the toys in TOY STORY figuring out how to drive a car or the great aquarium escape in FINDING NEMO. Just as much imagination may have been expended in helping The Incredibles save New York City, but how many times have we seen New York saved in recent years? On the other hand, the trip through the closet to Monstropilis was a wonderful new experience. This is not to say that THE INCREDIBLES is a bad or unrewarding. Indeed, it was worth it just to hear Holly Hunter as Elastigirl -- with that voice she was born to do cartoon voiceovers.",Null,11,24,24 November 2004
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," ...toc-tic..toc-tic...toc-tic..
","The central premise of THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is that the title protagonist doesn't age, but rather grows steadily younger throughout the film. He is born the size of a newborn, but his body is racked with the ailments of an old man  - arthritis, cataracts, wrinkles, etc. The story follows his seven decades of existence as a backward ride through a forward moving society, until he progresses/regresses and dies as an infant. It is a bizarre and strangely pointless concept, which seemingly would have to carry with it a message about life and living, otherwise, why bother telling it. But for all of its lush storytelling and sometimes strikingly beautiful imagery, BENJAMIN BUTTON is a very long film with nothing of any real relevance to say.There are several problems here. One, though the film can illustrate his physical change through make up and special effects, it can't  or at least, doesn't  capture the emotional and psychological effects of such a development. To be a child, with all of the expanding wonderment that entails, but to be trapped in a decrepit, aged body, would have to carry with it a remarkable psychological burden. The story, as penned from F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story by Eric Roth, sidesteps this by contriving circumstances wherein young Benjamin is raised in an old folks home. Thus the story gives us a character, who by his very nature is an outsider, but places him in a cocoon during his formative years where his malady is seemingly perfectly natural and accepted. He is an old man raised in an environment of old people. Where is the drama in that? In his middle years, aged twenty to fifty or sixty, his age isn't that important to what he does; and his last years, where he shrinks from a teen to a tot, are rushed through with little concern for their importance.But the retirement home isn't the only place where the film negates Benjamin's curious condition. The film details his growing younger and the other characters are always noting the change, but no one seems particularly surprised, let alone shocked by it. Though years pass between the times Benjamin sees various characters, there is no questioning that the suddenly younger Benjamin is who he says he is and only the mildest of confusion about the situation. And given the uniqueness of his condition, it would seem that it would be a biological anomaly that would warrant genuine scientific study, perhaps even popular notoriety; but that isn't the case. The story plays out like an unrealistic fairy tale set against a realistic background, yet its only moral seems to be that it is painful to outlive the people you love -- which is true with or without the backward growth gimmick.For all the purpose it carries, the story could just as easily have abandoned the anti-aging tricks and it wouldn't have had much effect on the events in Benjamin's life; with little change, the same story could have been told had Benjamin aged naturally. Maybe, free of the central gimmick, the film might have been more interesting, or more honest anyway. As is, the film contains little wisdom about the joys and pains of growth and even less about how one's age is reflected in one's environment.The film's biggest problem however is that Benjamin Button isn't that interesting as a character. At least, not as played by Brad Pitt. The incredibility of the story could be accepted or forgiven if Benjamin was a person worth being concerned about. But there is nothing larger than life about Benjamin; and other than his wartime adventures, there really isn't much that happens in his life that is all that remarkable -- falling in love, losing love, becoming a father, facing the death of loved ones, etc. These everyday joys and tragedies could be powerful if presented as part of the life of a colorful and caring character, but in Pitt's hands, Benjamin is a quiet, polite and even docile person. Pitt gives us a character who is simply rather banal. If the point of the story is that Benjamin's biological oddity is what makes him distant and aloof, then the film does a poor job of making that clear. The most curious aspect of Benjamin Button's existence is that after spending several hours with him, and experiencing all the ups and downs of his life, one is likely to be at a loss to remember him at all.What makes BENJAMIN BUTTON a curious case is trying to figure why it was even made. Devoid of an intriguing center in Benjamin and wrapped in an elaborate and meaningless gimmick involving his reverse aging, the film is a harmless, if long-winded trifle. BENJAMIN BUTTON is like its protagonist, a pleasant enough acquaintance, but one that will pass through your life with barely a ripple of difference.",6,3,5,22 February 2009
Million Dollar Baby," From avenging angel to benevolent god...
","In examining a career of five decades and about five dozen movies, it isn't difficult to find within Clint Eastwood's body of work examples of glorified, mindless brutality. Through the spaghetti westerns, Dirty Harry films, war films and assorted thrillers, it would a daunting task to calculate just how many lives have been cinematically snuffed out by Eastwood's various alter egos. The body count must be staggering. With few exceptions, violence and death are given elements, indeed, trademarks of Eastwood's work. Yet, from that collected carnage, it would be difficult to find even one example of a death that was treated with anything resembling compassion or regret. That makes the ending of MILLION DOLLAR BABY so stunningly poignant -- and yet strangely predictable. Once again a character dies at Eastwood's hands, but the death does not come easy nor is it a moment of violent glory or a display of justice as an ironic joke. Death becomes a moral choice, not a reflex action or an act of calculated revenge. BABY stands virtually alone in suggesting that life has value and its loss is a genuine tragedy. But it is very late in the film that BABY gains any gravity. Mostly it is a well-acted, nicely photographed collection of boxing movie clichés. Father-figure boxing trainer Eastwood reluctantly takes under his wing an untrained, but plucky athlete and gruffly guides her to the championship. Making the would-be contender a female gives the film a slight nudge toward freshness, but it really makes surprisingly little difference in how the story is told. Even the parent-child relationship is not based on gender so much as on plot contrivance. The film teases us with references to past mistakes and an estranged daughter, but vital aspects of the older man's life never get resolved. But if we get a too cryptic backstory on Eastwood's Frankie Dunn, the film supplies too much information about Swank's Maggie Fitzgerald. The fact that the film works at all is due primarily to Hilary Swank's ability to infuse a potentially one-note character with depth and complexity. Giving us an authentic interpretation of 'white trash' trying to literally fight her way out of poverty, Swank's wonderful performance is so nicely self-contained, so complete, that the addition of her kin as abusive, uncaring, greedy Ozark trailer park hillbillies seems not only unnecessary, but stereotypically insulting. As a film unto itself, BABY is Maggie's story; a bittersweet tale of persevering optimism crushed by cruel fate. It seemingly preaches that the journey to victory is as meaningful as any victory obtained. Going the distance, as it were; even if fate unexpectedly shortens the journey. In this context, the film is sad, yet strangely uplifting. Even so, most of the film is simply trite. But it does at least set up the emotional bonds that link the characters and gives the film's finale its dramatic oomph. A film of no great insight suddenly risks controversy, tackling the issue of assisted suicide. You have to admire Eastwood for even approaching such an issue, even if the script does stack the deck in favor of it's chosen outcome. To a great degree, it isn't a film about boxing at all, the sport being only a backdrop and a not-so-subtle metaphor for life in general. But by dwelling on the build up to the big bout, the filmmakers short change and cheapen the ultimate focus of their narrative. The film approaches the controversial moral issue almost like an afterthought. As actor and director, Eastwood has made a career out of glorifying killers, whether he is playing a cop, a soldier or gunslinger. But in the 1990's, the one-note Eastwood film image took on a degree of complexity with films like UNFORGIVEN, A PERFECT WORLD, IN THE LINE OF FIRE and most notably, THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, a film that is most shocking because it is devoid of physical violence. Otherwise, even as his characters espouse a growing philosophical distaste for violence, they nonetheless end up killing. Now, Eastwood is once more playing a killer, albeit a reluctant one. Though BABY seems like it is light-years removed from the sadism and nihilism of DIRTY HARRY, once again we have a protagonist, living in a violent world, who is given a set of circumstances where taking human life is to be assumed as a logical, and possibly heroic, action. Whether playing a rogue cop snuffing out a serial killer or a saintly father easing a child's pain, as likely as not, Eastwood's characters find reasons to kill. Like Harry Callahan and William Munny and Josey Wales and the 'Man With No Name' and so many other Eastwood protagonists, Frankie Dunn becomes a man of violence, a man who's acts of violence are romanticized and rationalized as heroic deeds. If viewed as part of Eastwood's total filmography, the film is more depressing than merely sad, more cynical than tragic. Again we have an Eastwood character who can only solve problems through violence. Seen as an individual act, Maggie's death has a stunning impact. Seen as a new variation on Eastwood's usual shtick, euthanasia seems like just another excuse for Eastwood to portray a noble assassin. And again, Eastwood's character rides off into the sunset, a mythic figure, alone, but unpunished and outside the law. Even though Frankie actually struggles with the morality of killing, he still kills. It is as if the struggle against doing something wrong, in the end, justifies doing it. And instead of defining him as a murderer, the ethical struggle elevates him from avenging angel to benevolent god. As such, MILLION DOLLAR BABY manages to be both optimistic and opportunistic, deeply moving and coldly calculating, morally thoughtful and cruelly amoral. It offers a noble fight, but it's rigged.",6,1,3,5 March 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," To Murrow's yesterday, today ...
","GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK begins and ends with Edward R. Murrow giving a keynote address at the Radio-Television News Directors Association's 1958 Chicago convention, at a fancy dress dinner designed to honor the newsman himself. The film spares us the lengthy address in its entirety, but the gist of the diatribe finds Murrow bemoaning the declining state of broadcast news in particular and the mediocrity of television in general. He takes exception with television wasting its potential with the likes of Ed Sullivan and Steve Allen, when what the public really needs -- whether it wants it or not -- is documentary reports on deteriorating schools and the dire state of mid-Eastern politics. Murrow is, of course, the patron saint of TV journalism. Whenever a situation requires that the highest standards of broadcast journalism be defined, Murrow's name is evoked as the benchmark by which all other newspeople must be judged. Thus the problem facing GOOD NIGHT director and co-author George Clooney was how to portray Murrow without making him seem too godlike. So, we get Murrow's 1958 speech: He was invited to be showered with rose petals for his contributions and he responds like a stern father scolding his children because they didn't make straight A's on their report cards. As played by David Strathairn, Murrow comes off as cold, condescending and humorless. It is a deft performance, but certainly not endearing. But, I suppose, Clooney didn't think Murrow had to be likable, since he is already beyond reproach. GOOD NIGHT concerns Murrow's legendary confrontation with anti-commie crusader Sen. Joesph McCarthy and never is there any doubt of Murrow's righteousness nor of McCarthy's evil. The film is in black and white in more ways than one. Whether or not this represents historical accuracy, it does make for strangely indifferent drama. There is little doubt that Murrow will put McCarthy in his place, thus the only real drama in GOOD NIGHT stems from how and when the newsman will be allowed to launch his attack. If the film has a villain it is the medium itself for being too timid -- the point of the opening sermon. The irony is that while the filmmakers call for a more aggressive and activist (liberal) media, the film itself is surprisingly inert. I won't question the courage it took for Murrow and company to stand up to McCarthy, but I don't think the film gives a clear picture of just why it took courage in the first place. As portrayed in GOOD NIGHT there is little real sense of the power that McCarthy held and even less sense of the genuine fear that communism held for the post-war American public. Communism was a growing power in the world and a threat, not just to good old American capitalism, but to journalistic and artistic freedoms as well. The film discounts that reality -- perhaps, because liberals never have seen communism as a real threat -- thus it is never acknowledged that McCarthy had his appeal and wasn't just some evil right-wing bogeyman. McCarthy's power and popularity grew as much from the public will as it did from his own overzealous paranoia. There isn't a hint of the danger that communism represented (whether real or imagined) and not even much feel for the threat of McCarthyism either. On the one hand, Clooney chose an easy target by having McCarthy as his villain, but on the other hand he paints himself into a corner by giving us adversaries who never even meet -- not even in making the film, as flesh-and-blood actor Strathairn plays Murrow and McCarthy is represented by vintage film clips, mere shadows on celluloid. Did Clooney think McCarthy's evil should speak for itself, or was he afraid an actor might actually give the character some sympathetic dimension? Whatever, the film is dramatically weak because there is no sense of confrontation in this confrontation. Murrow says something on air, McCarthy responds weeks later on film and Murrow responds to that. It's less a debate than an elaborate game of phone tag. Inadvertently I suspect, Clooney gives us a picture of a news media that seems isolated and insulated from the real world. The story barely leaves the newsroom, except for in archival footage. And in a strange display of political correctness, the film tries to establish the mood through musical interludes by African-American jazz singer Dianne Reeves, whose lovely voice can't quite disguise the fact that she is totally out of place in this film, in this story and in this era.Clooney establishes a nice feel of newsroom camaraderie and clearly tells his story in appropriately restrained journalistic fashion, but his story never gains momentum. It is admirable that Clooney keeps his drama low key, avoiding sensationalizing the material, and I'll just assume that the story is as historically accurate as any film can be. Though it is annoying that a film celebrating journalistic excellence has a title that is grammatically incorrect.",6,4,7,12 January 2006
8 Mile," Pre-wrapped rap
","Much of the action in 8 MILE takes place at 'slam poetry' competitions. The best way to describe these events as they are portrayed in the movie is to envision a bunch of over-sized children, standing around a garage/clubhouse, pretending to be Don Rickles spouting insults in the form of obscenity-laden Dr. Seuss rhymes to the pounding rhythms of bad disco; not so much as comedy routines, but as a form of warfare designed to humiliate and degrade an opponent. Rap -- music for people with no musical talent performed for people with no musical appreciation -- has taken the art of poetry and left it beaten and bleeding in the gutter. An art form created to extol on the beauty of life and to reveal the innermost sentiments of the poet has become a popular entertainment composed of superficial crudity, anger and mean-spirited verbal sadism. Eminem, the great white hope of rap, adds at least one extra element to the mix: Self pity.Obviously, I don't 'get' rap. As poetry, it is as complicated as nursery rhymes, without the innocence. The lyrics tend toward the hateful and condescending, a tough-guy attempt to justify poetry by turning it into a weapon. Melodically, its seems to depend on a pounding beat, which quickly becomes monotonous. And those who defend it as an urban art form, a from-the-streets poetry that cannot be divorced from the racial and social roots from which it sprang, seem to be making a desperate attempt to overlook the inherent racism, sexism and homophobia of the material. If you criticize the message, you're criticizing the source; i.e., to hate rap is to reveal yourself as a racist. Into this milieu came Eminem, a.k.a. Marshall Mathers, a white boy in a black man's game. Unlike his predecessor, the artificially flavored poser Vanilla Ice, Mathers could at least claim to be from the streets. And apparently he is good at his craft, though personally I can't tell good rap from bad rap. But, it seems his main contribution is that he legitimized rap for white audiences; primarily white, middle-class teenage boys who feel they can now do the 'black' thing and not look too foolish (though Justin Timberlake, disproves this). Eminem became sort of the Pat Boone of rap. But, being white, Eminem could still be criticized for his racism, sexism and homophobia by critics who would feel uncomfortably politically incorrect doing the same about black rap. Presumably, minorities have a right to bigotry that whites don't. Anyway, that is where 8 MILE comes in. It seems to be an attempt to legitimize Eminem as a more mainstream celebrity -- to clean up his image, in much the same way PRIVATE PARTS tried to make Howard Stern look like a swell guy. To its credit, the film doesn't try to give us a major whitewash, preferring instead to perpetuate Eminem's prepackaged image as an embittered rebel. The film has been compared to Prince's PURPLE RAIN, but it perversely has more in common with The Beatles' A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. That landmark musical took The Beatles image of being impish pranksters and joyous musicmakers and centered it in a pseudo-biographical slice of life comedy. Eminem's film does the same in the other direction, placing his crafted image as a put-upon, angst-ridden, victimized teenager against a pseudo-biographical backdrop of urban depression. It is telling that while The Beatles sang about love and longing, Eminem's repertoire seems to consist largely self-pitying rants about how miserable his life is. He seems to appeal to the same core audience that identifies with Holden Caulfield and reads 'The Catcher in the Rye' repeatedly -- assuming, of course, that Eminem's fans actually read. I don't know just how accurate the film is, but I do have trouble believing that improvised poetry sessions would attract large numbers of disenfranchised urban youths, or that a largely black audience would get all charged up over hearing a white boy spouting badly rhyming verses filled with references to 'Leave it to Beaver.' The film's genius is that even though it is yet another story designed to show white superiority -- even when invading a uniquely African-American culture -- it makes the white boy appear to be the victim of the racism. As for Eminem, I don't see any long term cinematic success for him. Though he wears the persona comfortably, there just aren't that many roles for mopey, dopey, petulant, perpetually unhappy twentysomething teenaged boys. The film itself will find its place as a cultural oddity and as fodder for trivia games: i.e., What is the only Oscar nominated song not to be performed at the Awards show because of its use of obscenities? Answer: Eminem's 'Lose Yourself' -- which, by the way, is the only Oscar-winning song to include the word 'vomit.' That says something right there.",3,3,9,2 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Shrill swill, nil skill, will still fill ill Kill Bill ...
","((((SPOILERS)))) I am convinced that Quentin Tarantino, at some point in his charmed life, sold his soul to the devil. There is no other way to explain how someone with such limited talent, lack of vision, poor taste and apparent bloodlust can, not only find huge success in making movies, but earn an astonishing amount of critical praise as a genius. He turns out unmitigated junk like KILL BILL (Vol. 1 & 2), and the only possible, logical reason for it being embraced is that Satan has stepped in and worked the blackest of black magic. QT had better enjoy his success, because someday he may have to pay. KILL BILL is a pop culture trash heap, celebrating cinema at it's worst. Tarantino regurgitates garbage, but because he can recreate trash with a degree of flare and an eye for the colorful visual, it is mistaken for art. KILL BILL lovingly weaves together elements of chop-socky epics, klutzy yet ponderous martial arts flicks, spaghetti westerns, third rate film noir, fourth rate horror films and other random bits of genre and exploitation films that most respectable critics would avoid like the plague and somehow this cluttered homage to junk cinema is seen as visionary. What he is doing is nothing new; Spielberg and Lucas built their careers on reliving their childhood guilty pleasures with multimillion dollar budgets. And that is not to mention the glut of films that find their inspiration in the superficial world of comic books and TV series from the 1960s. Long gone are the days where classic literature, folk legends and mythology represent cultural touchstones for storytelling; now you'd be hard pressed to come across a Shakespearean quote, not when a reference to a Trix breakfast cereal commercial is deemed to be so much more insightful. Playing verbal Trivial Pursuit with every other line of dialogue isn't necessarily a bad thing; it can add a touch of whimsy and a cultural context to a tale. But in Tarantino's exceedingly narrow view of the world, every thought, every quip is reduced to a pop culture reference. Yet, the overabundance of arcane trivia he shoehorns into his scripts doesn't have a punch. They're not there for social commentary or to even particularly define a character's social background, but to show off Tarantino's own knowledge of minutiae. No matter how skillful he is as a director (and I won't argue that he isn't a clever craftsman) or how blood soaked his scenes or obscenity laden his dialogue, Tarantino still comes off as the know-it-all class geek trying to prove how smart he is. The problem is that he is not dispensing knowledge, only parroting catchphrases and factoids. There is no original thought in a Tarantino film, just repackaged leftovers. Not that his screenplays don't try to pretend to have depth. In KILL BILL, Tarantino supplies a batch of clichéd fortune cookie bromides, probably recycled from old movies just like his action scenes. These bits of canned wisdom come off as forced and phony as the pseudo-Biblical nonsense that Samuel L. Jackson babbles in PULP FICTION. Tarantino's fans, both in the audience and in the press, latch onto these superficial bits of pseudo-philosophy as they try to defend his films as being more than the lame, ugly, ultra-violent exploitations they are. This despite the obvious, that Tarantino glibly seems to approach his material with a hokey-jokey attitude. Tarantino gets it both ways: he gets to trivialize his violence by packaging it in glib humor, while his defenders try to justify the violence by claiming it is part of something with much deeper meaning. Either way, both avoid dealing with the reality that his films are extended wallows in sleazy, pointless, sadistic violence. For the most part, KILL BILL is nothing more than just another slasher/serial killer flick. The only difference is that the stalking killer is supposed to have our sympathy. Uma Thurman's The Bride, a.k.a. Beatrice Kiddo, follows in the footsteps of Vincent Price in dozens of horror films as the wounded victim seeking vengeance for a past injustice. Thurman, alas, has none of the class of Price, just as KILL BILL has none of the wit, style or charm of his old AIP mini-epics. But if all one wants in a film is elaborate displays of over the top violence than Tarantino fills the bill, so to speak. Otherwise, eighty percent of the film is wasted celluloid. It is not until the end that Tarantino gets to the point, the confrontation between Kiddo and Bill, her mentor, lover and adversary. We get a plot twist that actually gives a purpose to the rest of the film -- finally. The Bride and Bill have a confrontation like a perverse version of KRAMER VS. KRAMER and the complications that the film has vaguely hinted at become a genuinely compelling situation -- and something rare in Tarantino's limited world: real human interaction. But, having saturated his story with blood, gore and cynicism, it is hard to care. Tarantino wants us to have a warm and fuzzy feeling at the end, but having given us a heroine who, even before her campaign of revenge, was a cold-blooded, monstrous killer, why should we wish her a happily-ever-after ending. Rather than being ironic, the ending is depressing. Sadder still than the dubious quality of Tarantino's shallow, overlong epic is that he has gained iconic status as the purveyor of sadistic chic and cold-blooded cool, an icon to be admired and imitated. The violence in his films are nothing compared to the violence he has inflicted on our pop culture.",2,11,20,18 February 2005
Big Fish," Telling stories, storytelling and a very telling story
","There are two types of 'big fish:' one is the proverbial 'one that got away' and the other is the resident of the so-called 'small pond.'  The Big Fish in BIG FISH is both. As played by the larger-than-life Albert Finney, Edward Bloom is a teller of tall tales who maintains his status in the small pond of his life by keeping all who will listen informed about all the ones that got away. Whether he is a habitual liar or merely a rascally old coot is totally up to the listener. You either laugh with him or at him.To his son, Will (Billy Crudup), Ed is the liar. All the tales he tells have alienated him from his son. Ed insists that his stories are who he is, they tell all there is to know about Ed's vision of the world. But Will thinks the stories exist only to hide who Ed really is from the world.
What one sees as a bridge, the other sees as a wall.Part of the chip on Will's shoulder is made up of jealousy. Ed's whoppers about his encounters with giants, werewolves, mermaids and the like were first devised by the young Ed (Ewan McGregor) to amuse Will the child. Eventually they became fodder for parties and banquet toasts. Gifts for the child were freely shared with the rest of the world. Will wants a piece of his father to call his own. Ed doesn't have that much more to give.BIG FISH is about walking the line between lying and embellishing. It is a thin line: a lie is an embellishment you can't accept; an embellishment is a lie you can. These are embellishments that are easy to accept thanks to Tim Burton's eye for the mystical, the bizarre and the just plain crazy. He weaves a colorful tale, and interweaves it with a touching story of a father and son reunion. It is all so beautifully done.But BIG FISH is also a story about storytelling, be it the after dinner yarn or the multimillion dollar movie. From the latter stand point, it is Tim Burton's personal story -- and the story of all filmmakers. Burton seems to be saying 'This is me. This is my life. I am my movies; my movies are me. It's all true, with embellishments.'",10,0,0,12 March 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," Empty space
","Seldom has so much awe been directed at a film with so little to say. The message that 2001 imparts can be summed up simply: Intelligence is the element that made apes into humans and will eventually cause humans to evolve even further. Shorter still: Intellect = evolution. Not particularly profound. Not particularly controversial. Not even particularly original. Just a common sense observation. But director Stanley Kubrick's penchant for pretentious rambling and oblique storytelling invites viewers to make desperate attempts to look for greater meaning, which simply is not there. As the old saying goes: There must be a pony!Which is not to say the film is devoid of substance. Buried in the middle of the film is a Jim-dandy episode of 'The Twilight Zone.' When the astronauts find themselves at war with HAL, the computer that serves as both their servant and their master, the film -- finally -- develops into a compelling drama. The situation itself is suspenseful, plus, it lends itself to many interpretations: Man versus machine, man versus his God, intellect versus instinct, the future versus the present, etc. Dramatically, visually and intellectually, the film does, ever so briefly, live up to its hype. The heart of the film beats strong. Unfortunately, the heart beats in a body that is grotesquely deformed.For a film that looks so sparse and lean, 2001 is ridiculously flabby and out of shape. What is amazing is that so much of what is romanticized as being mystical and philosophical is really just contrived and sometimes just plain silly. The infamous black monolith is a mere MacGuffin, a gimmick that lamely propels the story and loosely ties together the film's three acts. The controversial and endless 'dawn of man' prologue drags on far past the point where it has anything to say and yet still reveals so little about either the film's plot or mankind. The 'star child' finale is, to be kind, cute, but no more insightful than the rainbow at the end of E.T.The adoration the film has acquired has an almost cult-like arrogance to it: 'The film is great because we 'get' it and those who don't are just too stupid or shallow or, well, just not one of us.' Yet, when pressed, few even attempt to venture a guess as to why the film is awe inspiring, brilliant and revolutionary. Instead, the film's defenders only make excuses for the film's failings: It's boring!  'No, it's meditative.' The scenes are repetitive and drag on too long! 'No, Kubrick trusts the viewer to absorb the beauty and the depth of the images, which transcend conventional film pacing.' The ending makes no sense! 'No, the film defies conventional logic.' Why? How? 'Well, it has to, otherwise why would it be like it is?'
The ultimate paradox about 2001 is that Kubrick is hailed as a genius because he has made a film that raises more questions than it ever hoped to answer. The mere fact that it is so vague in its intentions angers some, but it overly impresses others.  To argue that the film is great just because it can't be easily explained is no more honest than saying it is lousy because it can't easily be explained. And for my money, a genius is one who provides answers, or at least theories, not one who just asks questions.
The irony is that even with all the pretentious hot air with which Kubrick over inflates his epic, he still gets his basic message across. To survive, the astronaut Bowman must defeat HAL, but in doing so he, at best, only delays his own extinction. The evolution of intelligence, even in a corrupted state, will be man's undoing. Mankind is doomed to outsmart himself.  And the same can be said for Stanley Kubrick.",6,5,10,19 April 2004
Alice in Wonderland," 'Twasn't brillig!
","If ever there were a working example of the word 'whimsical,' it would be the works of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll), i.e.: 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking Glass.' The stories, stuffed with clever word play, non-sequiturs, train-of-thought chaos and general silliness, are not exactly funny, so much as just being playfully amusing. The reader – like Alice – takes a trip of wayward, unpredictable imagination. Tim Burton's film version (or re-imaging) of Carroll's tales likely will never be accused of being whimsical. Indeed, one would be hard pressed to find a trace of whimsy in any line of dialog or overwrought image. Burton's film, while certainly being visually stunning, is also dark, and at times just plain depressing.Burton has said that he never felt emotionally connected to the 'Wonderland' stories because they seemed like they were just about a young girl wondering around meeting unusual characters. Which is exactly what they were about. Their unpredictable nature and inexplicable logic is what made them what they were: engaging, if somewhat high-toned, nonsense. Burton and his screenwriter Linda Woolverton have tried to tame the material by boxing it into clichés and a tiresomely predictable plot. He expertly keeps the visuals more or less right – though he has made it all look gloomier and creepier – but the literary essence of the original material has been tossed aside to make room for little that might be considered funny and even less that might pass for fun.The story begins with Alice, as a little girl, interrupting her father's business meeting to tell him she has had another in a series of recurring dreams, presumably about Wonderland, and she asks him if the dreams are a sign she is going mad. A few joking and reassuring words temporarily puts her mind at rest, but the film reveals itself; the dream world of the little girl is now to be treated as a nightmare world that may be caused by or will result in mental illness. The story jumps a head over a decade later where Alice's widowed mother hopes to marry her off in an arranged union with an upper class twit. Will Alice wed the twit? Duh! The end is obvious – as is the heavy-handed feminism jammed into the story.Soon Alice (Mia Wasikowska) falls down another rabbit hole and lands in Wonderland – or is that Underland? But Wonderland is now a bleak and ramshackle place, with most everybody living in fear of the tyrannical Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Alice eventually discovers that she is the chosen one, expected to help the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) save Wonderland from the bombastic Red Queen by battling the ferocious Jabberwock. Instead of a bewildered outsider lost in a strange world, Alice is now a reluctant messiah. Few of the oddball characters from Carroll's books have been retained, apparently to make room for an expanded role for Burton's favorite muse, Johnny Depp as The Mad Hatter. Depp takes up far too much of the story time for a character who looks far more interesting then he really is. Worse, a hint of a possible romance between the Hatter and Alice rings false.This ALICE IN WONDERLAND isn't for kids. Of course, the same could be said for the original books, what with their obscure literary allusions and now-dated popular references. Whether for commercial reasons or a sheer lack of imagination, the film is yet another childhood fantasy that has been re-written into an adult horror film. Like the disastrous THE WIZ and Steven Spielberg's overblown HOOK, a gentle and benignly scary fairy tale has been twisted around in order to supposedly explore adult themes. And as Disney did this once before, back in 1985, when they made RETURN TO OZ, a horrible and unwarranted sequel to THE WIZARD OF OZ: they've taken a colorful, playfully perplexing fantasy world and turned it into something unpleasant and uninviting. There's nothing particularly wrong with taking an old literary classic and looking at it through fresh eyes, if the look is truly fresh, but remains true to the original -- as, say, Burton did with SLEEPY HOLLOW.Like the recent SHERLOCK HOLMES, this ALICE an exercise in dumbing down. Just as the former film takes Holmes and de-intellectualizes him, making him into a rough-and-tumble superhero, the later indulges in victim feminism, turning Alice from being a precocious, adventurous child into a sorrowful, reactive woman. Here Burton and screenwriter Woolverton become regressive feminists, changing a wide-eyed, curious little girl into a repressed, depressed and distressed woman who 'takes control of her dream,' dons armor and becomes a warrior and ends up being empowered.And what does this empowerment lead to? She becomes a businesswoman. So much for intellectual whimsy.",Null,16,25,24 March 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Violent actions, violent reactions...
","According to IMDb.com, Stanley Kubrick had exhibition of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE stopped in the United Kingdom after his family received death threats protesting the film. There is a certain irony here: Kubrick's film at the very least trivializes violence and maybe even glamorizes it, but Kubrick himself didn't seem to recognize the power and the influence that stylized violence has, until it posed a real threat to him and his family.A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is undoubtedly a fascinating film to watch. Its creation of a bizarre, pop-art, surrealistic, vaguely futuristic world is, as you'd expect from Kubrick, meticulous and detailed. The film fulfills a daring, conceptually bold vision of a world that is violent, superficial and coldly impersonal. In essence, a somewhat more colorful version of the type of world with which Kubrick became increasingly fascinated. And, as in the Kubrick style, the more obsessively intense the appearance of the film, the more progressively shallow it is thematically and philosophically. Like much of Kubrick's work, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is about how something is said, but not all that interested in what is actually being said.The film is not just about violence, but about the theatrics of violence. The acts of violence are just that, acts -- i.e., performances -- of violence. Some of this is obvious: a gang rape happens on a theatre stage and another rape is performed as the main character parodies 'Singin' in the Rain.' Other instances are less obvious, but still apparent as Kubrick takes great pains to control angle, lighting and image to make the attacks 'ultra-violent,' but in a photogenic way. We don't see the violence as realistic, but in a jazzed up cinematic way. Terrible things happen to otherwise innocent people, but Kubrick isn't interested in their suffering, but in the calculated high his protagonist and his fellow thugs get as they commit crimes -- and the calculated high he wants the audience to have as they watch. ORANGE's anti-hero is Alex (Malcolm MacDowell). Alex is a rapist and a murder and God-only-knows what else. Kubrick wants Alex to be seen as the film's victim. To this end, Alex is arrested and, during the course of the film, reprogrammed to abhor violence. This, it seems, makes Alex a helpless victim in the real world, much like the helpless victims he terrorized during the first half of the film. The difference is that Alex is the victim of a big, mean, horrible government that has left him stripped of his free will, while Alex's various victims were, well, secondary characters; important as props, but little else. Kubrick seems oblivious to the fact that his argument in favor of individual freedom has little respect for most of its individual characters. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is unique in the world of film, there is nothing quite like it. But, unfortunately, it is very typically Kubrick. Like an architect or interior designer who strives to be an artist, Kubrick creates a world that is stunning visually, but coldly inhospitable. He is so obsessed with having every frame of his movies looking just so, that he neglects to create worlds where there is room for anything as messy as humanity. Even in a film like ORANGE with its defense of free will at any cost, Kubrick himself seems to fear anything as uncontrollable as spontaneity. His plea for free will is cold and mechanical. Kubrick's message is that being robbed of free will by the state is far worse of a crime than rape or murder or any other act of violence. Which, in theory, is a noble philosophy, assuming you have not been a victim of rape or murder or any other act of violence. Whether in the real world or the reel world, violence always robs its victims of their free will, and in far more oppressive ways than suffered by Alex. It is sad and somewhat telling that Kubrick wants to work up a great deal of pity for a shallow monster like Alex, who essentially is stripped of his dubious right to do harm, but the director can't seem to muster up anything but a passing interest in the people who are harmed by Alex. Kubrick seems to respect Alex as a man of action, albeit antisocial action, over the benign passivity of his victims.ORANGE doesn't really condone violence, but it doesn't condemn it either. The film sees violence as a moral choice, something for the individual to accept or reject. Which would be fine, if the film also recognized that such choices come with responsibilities and consequences. What most people would see as justice -- Alex losing his freedom to chose his life's options -- the film sees as oppression. Whether you want to see it as chaos, anarchy, amorality or just plain stupidity, the film's seemingly high-minded defense of personal freedom is noble only if you are devoid of basic human compassion. That is, you are willing to place intellectual theory over simple human dignity. I suspect that Kubrick -- like the makers of other 'ultra-violent' films, from THE WILD BUNCH to NATURAL BORN KILLERS -- thought he was making a bold statement about our violent society, creating 'art,' but foolishly he didn't seem to grasp that such 'art' is what helps to make a society violent in the first place. Unquestioned violence begets indefensible violence. Art should be the antithesis of violence and even violent art should mock or repudiate violence. Maybe that idea finally hit home when Kubrick moved to suppress the film in order to protect his family.",5,9,21,29 May 2004
Reservoir Dogs," Cruel intentions...
","((((SPOILERS))))) I can think of nothing kind or good or positive to say about this truly repulsive motion picture. It is, quite simply, cruel. Quentin Tarantino's badly written script focuses on the events leading up to and the aftermath of a botched jewelry store heist. The heist itself is largely inconsequential to the story, as Tarantino's intent was apparently to create a character study of the participants. Yet, he has failed to give any of his characters anything resembling human personalities beyond phony macho posturing. The cast does little to add depth to the characters beyond the routine tough guy gambit of shouting their obscenity-laden dialogue at the top of their lungs. As such, they never raise their one-note performances above the level of brain dead savagery. But good, bad or indifferent, the actors have little to work with in the first place. Tarantino's much deified dialogue is insultingly dull-witted -- banal pop references peppered generously with tiresome profanity. The kindest thing to be said for Tarantino's ability to direct action is that it, at least, distracts from the emptiness of his written words. But, it is the violence that pushes the film into the realm of the utterly contemptible. There have been films with more violence and with more explicit violence, but few revel in its violence to the extent of RESERVOIR DOGS. The film doesn't use violence to show cause and effect, or to make a social statement, or to reflect reality, or even for cheap shock effect. It is violence for the sake of violence. The violence in DOGS is purely sadistic; a sleazy, pornographic celebration of inhuman cruelty.
Here and in his other violence-obsessed films, Tarantino embraces the infliction of pain as not just an act of power, but of an almost orgasmic display of gratification. Add to this the fact that the victims of the violence are usually bound, helpless, terrified, tortured, randomly selected and undeserving of such cruelty and the violence clearly becomes symbolic of rape. Worse, such savagery encourages the audience to identify with the perpetrator, not the victim, and Tarantino (all too effectively, I'm afraid) tries to make the viewer complicit in his sadism.  Okay, if Tarantino wants to indulge in his little S&M fantasies, that is his business. What is disheartening is the way people -- filmgoers and professional critics alike -- have been seduced into not just tolerating Tarantino's sadism, but to applaud it as well? DOGS centerpiece is the totally unnecessary and illogical kidnapping of a young policeman who is subsequently beaten, tortured and mutilated, for no apparent reason other than because it amuses one of the psychotic characters -- and, one can presume, Tarantino himself. The director stages the torture sequence like a comic musical number, complete with rock background music and choreography; casually topping it all off with the young officer's murder being the punchline of a joke. 'That's entertainment!' seems to be Tarantino's pathetically cruel message. This killing should inspire anger or, at the very least, pity for the innocent man. Instead, it elicited raves by film viewers who see the scene as stylish, or worse, cool. What does it say about our society that not only do we condone the glorification of senseless violence as entertainment, but applaud it as art? Why have we become so obsessed with the matter of 'style' that we can't see that beneath Tarantino's superficial technique there is sadism? RESERVOIR DOGS represents some sort of low point in the history of cinema. That it helped propel Tarantino to be considered one of the most influential directors of our time represents some sort of low point for society.",1,144,273,18 May 2004
Eyes Wide Shut," '10' without the laughs
","Despite the pre-release hype about how this film was to be on the cutting edge of sexual explicitness, Eyes Wide Shut isn't about having sex. It is about NOT having sex. Like Dudley Moore before him, Tom Cruise sets out to have an affair and, despite encountering a variety of eager women (and one man), can't seem to even get his pants unzipped. The result is a comedy of errors with no laughs; a porn film with no sex and a thriller with no suspense. Kubrick seems to have been hopelessly stuck in the early sixties as far has his view of eroticism is concerned. From Alan Cummings oh-so limp wristed homosexual to the orgy where everyone prances around in maskes and costumes, Kubrick seems to have thought he would shock the audience with something new and daring. But time passed Stanley by -- even soft-core porn offers more explicit material then presented here and daytime soaps have more insightful examinations of infidelity and maritial angst. This film is stylishly, but utterly gutless in addressing the issues it pretends to be exploring. And don't get me started on the truly awful musical score....",3,2,5,17 January 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," They Made a Bad, Bad Film...
","Eyes Wide Shut is the perfect title. Think about it, eyes that are wide open, but unable to see. You know, like a corpse...  Despite all the pre-release hype about the cutting edge sex supposedly being ingrained in this film, the end product is a film about NOT having sex. It is about a guy going out to have a quickie affair and despite getting propositioned by women, a teenage girl, a gay man and two prostitutes, not to mention attending an orgy, the guy never even gets his pants unzipped. It is like Blake Edwards' '10' without the laughs. Worse its soft core porn with no sex, a thriller with no suspense, and a drama with no depth or insight. It is a shaggy dog story, all build up with no pay off. It's like the orgy scene that is the film's center piece; everyone prances around in costumes and masks and never get around to doing anything, sexual or otherwise. (Was Kubrick so isolated from years of being locked away plotting movie scripts that he was totally out of touch with the real world and the sexual revolution? His prissy view of sexuality is like something that might have been shocking in the early sixties, but now seems embarrassingly infantile.) <BR> I will confess that I am not a great fan of Kubrick. True, as a visual stylist, he is quite accomplished, but it takes more than pretty pictures to make a great film. A heart and soul or at least a hint of passion are needed. I write this after having seen A.I., a truly great film. It has Kubrick's striking visual sense, but Spielberg gave it what has been missing from Kubrick's work since before 2001, and that is humanity.",3,0,1,13 July 2001
The Da Vinci Code," Da Vinci didn't convince me!
","Okay, I decided to write a review of THE DA VINCI CODE, but I thought, golly gee, wouldn't it be great to do the critique, but do it in calligraphy in invisible ink on rare parchment paper, seal it in a container with a numerical lock so complicated that only a mathematical genius could decipher it and bury it in sacred ground at a location that can only be determined by solving an anagram created from a riddle written as a limerick and scrawled in blood on the back of a rare painting hanging in a museum that is protected by armed guards who will allow you to bypass security, but only if you can prove you belong to a secret society by telling them the password that is the answer to a question posed as a palindrome written in Hebrew and posted at the website dopeyopie.com.But, then I asked myself, who in their right mind would be stupid enough to go to all that trouble just to learn the secret of what I think of the movie THE DA VINCI CODE -- as brilliant and insightful as my opinion ultimately might be. Of course, my little scavenger hunt is nothing compared to the conspiracies and counter-conspiracies whose gnarly tentacles thrive like kudzu in Ron Howard's movie based on Dan Brown's novel. It involves competing secret societies, both of whom seem obsessed with creating elaborate puzzles and word games designed to keep or uncover sinister schemes that will either save or destroy Christianity as we know it today. But just who in this ridiculously complex game of charades is supposed to be the good guys or the bad guys is open to interpretation. At any rate, there are tax codes that are easier to decipher than the rambling plots that unravel and tangle up again in this bloated narrative.Tom Hanks, clearly miscast as a Harvard professor, plays a 'symbologist' who, for reasons that are never made clear, becomes the unsuspecting contestant who is sucked into the rival convoluted conspiracies that center on the search for the Holy Grail, which we are told is a who and not a what. All this springs from the notion that Jesus Christ did not die a virgin, but married Mary Magdelene and sired a child and that created a lineage that survives today. It is but one of the film's innumerable plot holes that it assumes that after 2000 years and possibly 100 generations, only one possible offspring would exist and not the thousands that are likely. And if you don't figure out just who that one possible offspring is within the first half hour, than you definitely are not heavenly inspired, because that is the least mysterious mystery in the story.All the densely packaged clues, theories, wild guesses and 'evidence' that supposedly reveal that the Christ story is a hoax are tossed at the audience in a fast and furious manner, yet the story still seems to drag on endlessly. And after going the long way around, it is obvious at the end that the revelation of the 'truth' is not likely to make one bit of difference: It would take a lot more than this junk theology to cause the devout to doubt or the church to crumble. Seldom will you find a film's ending more deserving of a shrug and an indifferent 'So what?' It is, however, obvious why the Catholic church among others are offended by THE DA VINCI CODE because it does suggest that the churches willful have lied about Jesus' divinity as a cruel excuse to brutalize others and commit church-sanctioned murder. And while it is refreshing, in this era when so many movies are constructed like insipid video games, that here is a movie and book that tries to appeal to the thinking man. But strip away the sanctimonious pseudo-religious prattle and it is just another film about nailing the evil corporation (i.e., the Catholic Church, Inc.) that is selling a product deemed to be defective (i.e., religious faith). That aside, THE DA VINCI CODE is little more than ludicrous neo-feminist propaganda: the piety of women versus the chauvinism of men.Yet, if Jesus did marry, what's the big deal? Becoming a husband and father would only confirm belief in the power of marriage and family and it would not necessarily contradict Jesus' virgin birth, his divinity or the validity of his philosophical teachings. The true mystery is why the churches have so foolishly acted as the PR agent for the film. All the indignant protests and hysterical calls for boycotts have done nothing but create book-buying, ticket-selling publicity that has drawn in millions of gullible consumers who otherwise wouldn't have cared less about this rather silly story.And in its pursuit if the Holy Grail, DA VINCI's quest is neither as funny as Monty Python's or as exciting as Indiana Jones'. And for that matter it isn't even as amusingly bad as the similarly themed HUDSON HAWK. Despite its arrogant self-importance, the film doesn't even meet minimum standards as decent entertainment; so let's just say that DA VINCI isn't up to code.",5,0,2,25 May 2006
A Beautiful Mind," Real, reel and surreal
","A BEAUTIFUL MIND is an extremely odd film.  On the surface it is the standard this-happened-that-happened biopic, the subject being a Nobel-winning mathematician named John Nash. But by the end of the film, instead of feeling you have learned about the man, the viewer is apt to understand him even less. The facts in the film are, at best shaky in the way all movie biographies play fast and loose with reality just to squeeze a man's life into two hours of screen time. Plus, questions arose after the film's release regarding embarrassing facts about the man that were left out, for one reason or another. But the biggest distraction is how the film blurs reality to somehow duplicate the man's own schizophrenia.  This is a film that tells a a story based on facts, takes dramatic license with facts, supposedly obscures the facts and makes up 'facts' that aren't reality to anyone accept one character within the film. What is real life, reel life and surreal life may not ever be really clear. On the one hand, I admire how director Ron Howard does a 'Twilight Zone' number on the audience, leading us to accept one thing only to slap us in the face with a new reality later. I don't necessarily think he goes far enough in exploring the plot possibilities. Nash's mental problems liberates Howard to try some daring stuff, but the reality that Nash is a living, breathing individual ropes him back in. The film might have been better (and oddly, more honest) had the whole story been fictional from page one of the screenplay.
Like Nash, the film finds a way of freeing itself of the boundaries that reality sets, unlike Nash, the film might have been better not totally regaining those boundaries. As is, the film is a solid enough piece of filmmaking: well acted and skillfully dishonest with the viewer. 
But the best thing about A BEAUTIFUL MIND is Russell Crowe's nuanced performance. Even without the delusional gimmickry, his performance following Nash's life from youth to old age is satisfying. The irony is that Crowe's performance is what lifts the film up above the ordinary, yet when Oscar time came around, he was overlooked and all the other major players were rewarded. Crowe was the real thing; all else was illusion. At the Oscars, the illusion won.",8,0,2,3 April 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Overkill ...
","MR. AND MRS. SMITH begins like a Woody Allen movie. John and Jane Smith sit looking at the camera, talking to the disembodied voice of a marriage counselor, revealing bits of their marital woes through awkward attempts at casual humor. It is a nice beginning, but totally misleading. What seems to be developing into a clever, bittersweet, sophisticated drama about a failing marriage evolves into a tiresomely violent and overwrought video game tale of suburban warfare.The twist, which the film treats as a surprise even though it is made apparent in all the advance advertising, is that John and Jane are paid assassins working for two rival, unidentified government agencies. They marry not knowing each other's little secret, which should indicate just how incompetent they are at their jobs. Then for reasons that are never made clear, they are assigned to kill each other. The result is the battle of the sexes as an extreme sport.It is an insipid idea for a movie, yet nonetheless intriguing: taking domestic violence out of the hands of amateurs and leaving it to the professionals. And as long as the cat and mouse bloodlust between John and Jane remains personal, the film has a sharp satirical edge. The battle of the sexes becomes more than a just an ironic metaphor. The problem is that the film doesn't know where to stop and a screenplay that wants to become more and more outrageous ends up just getting more and more stupid. It is alleged that the screenplay went through fifty drafts and presumably each successive screenwriter added a 'wouldn't it be cool if ...' moment that prompted them to exaggerate everything. When it takes on dimensions that would even be embarrassingly unbelievable in a James Bond movie, the result is like THE WAR OF THE ROSES on LSD: coyly malevolent but utterly incoherent.As the Smiths, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have a fair amount of chemistry, most apparent in a dinner sequence where paranoia and cunning are served up along with tainted roast beef and extremely sharp carving knives. But as they tango through scenes of bickering sarcasm their witty banter literally gets drowned out by explosions, gunfire and squealing automobile tires. Then, even though it rushes to resolve the conflict between the Smiths, the film drags on for another ultra-violent thirty minutes designed to -- but totally failing at -- explaining the plot's myriad loopholes. The film ends with a smug happily-ever-after in which nothing has been resolved.Ultimately, the film has no real point. As it systematically destroys all the symbols of middle-American bliss -- marriage, suburban home, mini-van, etc. -- one suspects that the original screenplay for MR. AND MRS. SMITH hoped to join the ranks of THE WAR OF THE ROSES; DIVORCE, AMERlCAN STYLE and even WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLFE? as a brittle commentary on the decline of the American family. But the right to even be compared to such films apparently was written out of the story during all those revisions, with any sharp insights gunned down by all the high-tech pyrotechnics. A film focusing on adult themes sells out totally to juvenile comic book mayhem.",5,31,62,22 July 2005
Psycho," It was a dark and stormy night...
","(((((SPOILERS))))For most people, the most memorable scene in Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO, indeed it's most famous scene, is the shower sequence. It has been broken down and analyzed ad nauseam as an example of the fine art of editing. It is a great sequence, but to me the best scene in PSYCHO occurs just before that. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, on the run from having committed a crime, sits in the parlor behind the Bates Motel's office and discusses nothing and everything with Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the motel's lonely proprietor. It is a chat between strangers who desperately need to talk to someone, anyone, but have no one to whom they can confide. It is a beautifully written and acted scene, which serves as the calm before the storm. For all of its flashiness and sleight-of-hand gore, the shower sequence isn't nearly as effective at showing what a master filmmaker Hitchcock was. It is in the parlor scene that the entire narrative spins around; as the audience is prompted to switch their allegiance from Marion to Norman. Nothing really happens in the scene, other than two characters talking, but how things are said reveals as much as what is actually said. Here Marion comes to terms with her mistake and decides to pull herself out of her 'private trap.' Norman introduces us, indirectly, to Mother and wins our sympathy, which is vital to the way the rest of the film plays out. The scene very skillfully sets the mood of uneasiness that propels us into the upcoming murder, even as it suggests that Marion is achieving a sense of inner peace. Madness is revealed, danger is suggested, yet the audiences is coolly and cruelly lulled into an almost tranquil state. It is obvious something is coming, but not so soon. Then the shower curtain is ripped aside and blood begins to splatter.The measure of a film like PSYCHO is not how cleverly it fools you the first time, but how irrelevant its surprises are to enjoying it time after time. Indeed, compare it to Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake, or even Brian De Palma's 1980 semi-remake, DRESSED TO KILL, and the power of the film is obvious. Van Sant's version, though a scene for scene imitation is barely watchable even once, especially if you are already familiar with the plot; and while De Palma's homage is stylish and intriguing the first time around, its psychology and plot tricks don't stand up on repeated viewings. By contrast, Hitchcock's PSYCHO can be viewed repeatedly with full awareness and appreciation of knowing what is coming up next. I think an element of Hitchcock's genius is apparent in that he doesn't treat his major plot twist as a just a gimmick. The entire first half of PSYCHO could have been treated as just a shaggy dog story, a prelude marking time until Norman Bates' story takes center stage. But Hitchcock realized that Janet Leigh's story had to be presented with all due gravity, otherwise the shift to Anthony Perkins' story wouldn't be nearly as effective. Neither Van Sant nor De Palma seemed to understand this, especially De Palma who treats the Angie Dickinson scenes in DRESSED with a cruel, condescending sense of humor. Hitchcock's PSYCHO works as a whole, but could very easily have been presented as two independent episodes of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents.....' Marion Crane's story is not just a build up (though Hitchcock himself claimed that killing off his leading lady was all meant as a joke on the audience), but as a complete story unto itself, replete with the type of shocking twist ending that was the hallmark of Hitchcock's television anthology. Likewise, the Norman Bates half of PSYCHO, is a complete suspense tale in its own right. The shower scene is the bridge between the two stories, but it is the scene in the parlor that cements the two tales -- and the fates of the two protagonist. And if you look at PSYCHO as two separate parts of a whole, then Marion's story is revealed to be the more complete of the two. Norman's story, while beautifully done, is essentially a mystery story; Sam, Lila and Arbogast are trying to solve a whodunit: what happened to Marion and the $40,000? The cleverness of Hitchcock and screenwriter Joseph Stefano is that they let us think we know the answer right off the bat, building to a conclusion where it is revealed how completely we have been fooled. In the end, we know little more than Lila and Sam. To some extent, this is the real gimmick of the film. On the other hand, Marion's story allows Hitchcock to make so much out of so little. He creates tension, even though there is no tangible threat. Marion is on the run with stolen funds, but the theft hasn't even been discovered yet. All of the danger is strictly in her mind: What will happen when...? She is a smart woman who has done something very stupid, but proceeds even as her fears grow and grow. But cinematically the suspense is created out of mundane things: a policeman's face at the car window, rain and windshield wipers slashing across the screen, the glare of on coming headlights. Mix this with the haunting voice overs of accusing voices and Bernard Herrmann incredible musical violence and the effect is hypnotic. But these imagined dangers do not prepare Marian or the audience for the real dangers ahead.And something has to be said for Janet Leigh. Always overshadowed by Anthony Perkins' iconic performance, Leigh never gets her due (though she was nominated for an Oscar, she lost to Shirley Jones in ELMER GANTRY). But she dominates the first half of the film with a vivid performance that is sexual, humorous and bittersweet. So much of her role depends on the subtlety of her facial expressions: her sad smile at pretending to believe Sam's excuses for not marrying her, her bemused glances at the flirtatious old millionaire, her self-satisfied smirks as she thinks about how people will react to discovering her crime, her mixture of concern and fear as she talks to Norman in the backroom parlor. Plus, she displays an attitude that is both smart and sexy. It is one of the great film performance.It's easy to take PSYCHO for granted now; it has been imitated so many times in so many ways by far lesser talents. Indeed, it's one negative is that it inspired so may pale imitations, including its own three sequels and a very bad remake. Yet even so, PSYCHO remains a one and only original. And its iconic status can't be denied; it redefined the concepts of what a Hitchcock film was and what a horror film could be.",10,13,16,13 June 2004
War of the Worlds," Worlds of difference
","There are many, many unanswered questions at the end of Steven Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS, but one overrides all others. Namely, why did Spielberg, the man who created such humane, thoughtful and landmark sci-fi epics as E.T., THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL; CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and JURASSIC PARK, decide to waste his time and talent remaking a piece of junk like INDEPENDENCE DAY? Okay, this WAR OF THE WORLDS is not really a remake, not even of the 1950's version of H.G. Wells' original story. It is a new variation of an old theme. But let's face it, this film exists not because of any compelling need to tell this particular story in any form, but because CGI special effects have advanced to the point that it is now relatively easy to show mass annihilation of innocent life and mindless destruction of large parcels of real estate with a greater degree of realism. Just like INDEPENDENCE DAY -- which, by the way, was a blatant rip-off of 'The War of the Worlds' -- this film is propelled solely by the desire to show images of devastation and mayhem.Like in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, Spielberg tells a personal story within the context of an intergalactic event. Beyond that, his two films have little in common; indeed, they are almost exact opposites. One story is about a man who abandons his family, while the other is about a man who strives to reunite his family. One is about a man mesmerized by the promise of otherworldly mysteries, while the other is terrorized by the realities of otherworldly invaders. In one, a little boy's encounter with aliens is a wondrous adventure; in the other, it is a little girl's horrifying ordeal. One film celebrates a promise of universal unity, while the other panders to paranoia and fear. One is a tale of divine hopefulness, the other of helpless despair.Granted, WAR OF THE WORLDS may boast superior effects, but it is not nearly as inspired as CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. And though it has many of Spielberg's stylistic touches, WORLDS seems like imitation Spielberg and less like a Spielberg film than carnage-riddled junk like GODZILLA, ARMAGEDD0N, CON AIR, THE ROCK, MARS ATTACKS! and many others, including INDEPENDENCE DAY. Instead of using his command of computer wizardry to take us once again into other awesome realms, Spielberg uses them to destroy ours. Quite frankly, I expect more of Steven Spielberg than blood-soaked landscapes and new, inventive ways to show people being slaughtered.I suppose we are to be impressed that Spielberg has increasingly tackled darker material as he has matured, foregoing movie serial adventures like Indiana Jones and childhood fantasies like Peter Pan. Certainly, after SCHINDLER'S LIST, a film that garnered him hard-won respect from the tougher critics, his films have gotten darker, though not necessarily better: AMISTAD, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, MINORITY REPORT and even A.I. (and on the horizon, films about the Munich Olympic terrorist attacks and Abraham Lincoln). But -- big deal! Something magical seems to disappear from Spielberg's works when he thinks he needs to be 'serious.' Maybe it's that playful sense of mischievousness or the spirit of joy that comes with trying out a new toy, but films like MINORITY REPORT and WAR OF THE WORLDS simply lack the energy, the humor and the excitement of even his earlier, simpler thrillers like JAWS and DUEL.You can't fault the man for wanting to try new things and experimenting with new cinematic recipes, but seeing Spielberg squander his talents on a something like WAR OF THE WORLDS is like watching the world's greatest pastry chef want to prove that he can fry up a perfectly adequate hamburger, or worse, butcher the cow to make the hamburger meat. It's enough to make you lose your appetite.",3,3,5,7 August 2005
There Will Be Blood," Blood runs cold
","A bowling pin.A bowling pin is used as a murder weapon at the end of THERE WILL BE BLOOD. It proves to be a perfectly effective means of committing a killing, but you have to ask 'Why a bowling pin?' At it's center, THERE WILL BE BLOOD is about a confrontation between the rewards of capitalism and the glories of religion -- the material versus the spiritual -- so of all the possible symbolic weapons that filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson could have selected for the killing -- a crucifix, a golden trophy, a mining tool -- why would he end his film using such a mundane thing as a bowling pin as a weapon? Maybe it is not that important, but it is strange that a film that carefully builds in mesmerizing power in the first half, only to see its sense of grandeur slowly dissipate in the second, would ultimately end in a scene so grim, yet unintentionally comic. What could have been and should have been one of the most powerful scenes in the film ends up being just curiously odd, with the horror of the action sapped by the lack of irony in the selection of the death tool.The film deals with Daniel Plainview, who rises from being a turn-of-the-century, dirt-poor prospector to being an oil tycoon. From prospecting for silver to striking oil to building an empire and helping a city rise out of the desert, the film reflects the building of America during an era when the Duponts and the Gettys and the Rockefellers grew into titans, slowly dragging the rest of the country up the ladder of prosperity with them. Director-writer Anderson generates both a sense of awe and giddy exhilaration as he charts Daniel's wheelings and dealings and manipulations, going beyond wealth to raw power. It is the American Dream in all of it's thrilling glory. The first half of THERE WILL BE BLOOD is masterfully told.But, as is the way with most visions of capitalism in Hollywood, the dream (or the dreamer) must be destroyed in the second half. That is to be expected; but as skillfully as Anderson shapes Daniel's rise, his means of destroying the dream is clumsy and lacking irony. Like a balloon that doesn't pop, but merely deflates, the second half of the film just shrinks to nothing. Daniel goes mad, but for reasons that are neither clear nor well articulated. The big gusher that secures Daniel's mega-wealth coincides with an accident that causes his adopted twelve-year-old son to go deaf. Despite his love for his son being unquestioned to this point, Daniel abruptly rejects the damaged child and embarks on a series of random plot twists. Nothing in the second half really flows logically, other than the assumption that success has driven Daniel insane. When he is shamed into reclaiming his son and manipulated by greed into receiving baptism, two things that might redeem him, they instead drive him further into madness. The film suggests that if religion is an opium to the masses, it is sheer poison to Daniel. That glib explanation isn't enough.But as poorly plotted as the film becomes, the biggest weakness in BLOOD is in the handling of the religious theme. Daniel's adversary throughout is Eli Sunday, a teenage preacher in the small Texas town that Daniel buys up and takes over. Though played well enough by Paul Dano, Eli is a weak character, not just morally but dramatically. The rivalry between the two is one-sided and no matter what Eli does, we never feel he will get the best of Daniel. I think Anderson sees the concept of religion as being just as corrupting as greed. He wants us to know right off the bat that Eli is, if not evil, at least fraudulent. He wants us to dislike him immediately and that is what Dano does with little subtlety, playing the boy evangelist as arrogant and devoid of charm, grace or sincerity. If we lose sympathy for Daniel, we never feel it at all for Eli, even when we should.Thus, the final confrontation falls flat. Going in we know that Eli is a false prophet, so when Daniel humiliates him and crushes him, there is no surprise and no sense of justice or victory on Daniel's part. Had Eli been established as a seemingly strong and noble character, and then Daniel succeeded in bullying him into denouncing God, that would have been a devastating climax. Or if the apparently weak-willed Eli had unexpectedly stood up to Daniel and confirmed that his belief in the power of God is stronger, that could have crushed Daniel and that would have been a powerful climax. But, as is, Anderson gives us a surprisingly violent ending where one evil character destroys another character of lesser evil, thus proving nothing about either greed or religion.Even with Anderson's craftsmanship behind the camera, the film is almost a one-man show, with Daniel Day-Lewis as Plainview propelling the story through even the sluggish second half almost totally on the strength of his dynamic performance. That alone guarantees that the film is never dull. Yet, for all of this forcefulness, I don't think Daniel Plainview ever becomes a three dimensional character. The film suffers from a dearth of interesting supporting characters for Day-Lewis to interact with, but more to the point, in showing how isolated Plainview is from others, the film never lets the character reveal himself to the viewer either. It is a big, glorious performance of a character who remains surprisingly small and empty.Anderson clearly wants THERE WILL BE BLOOD to be an epic just as much as Plainview wants to amass wealth. But just as Plainview finds that wealth without purpose is meaningless, Anderson shows us that the same is true about style without insight.",7,4,10,2 March 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," 'Don't make a bit of sense to me.'
","I know I'm in the minority, but my take on this film is the exact opposite of most of the other comments here. To me, McMurphy is the villain in this film. He is not the lovable scamp whose madcap antics enliven a mental institution -- as some seem to see him. He is, rather, a destructive, evil force. He is in the institution because he is faking mental illness in order to avoid prison for statutory rape. He has no compassion or sympathy for the other patients in the ward; he uses them as pawns to get what he wants. It is his reckless behavior, and not the 'evil Nurse Ratched', who brings about Billy's death. In the end, when he mets his 'tragic fate,' my feeling was that McMurphy is getting just what he deserves. McMurphy is a selfish, manipulative, self-righteous s.o.b., more sociopath than rebel. Rather than being a symbol of freedom, he is the personification of the abuse of freedom, a coward who takes no responsibility for his actions and lives only for himself. As for Nurse Ratched, to me, she is a sadly sympathetic character: a middle-aged, underpaid, under-appreciated nurse-turned-bureaucrat, apparently trapped in job for which she has no real competency. The only thing she can do is try to keep order, something which McMurphy cannot abide. Surrounded by patients she can't help, she has built up an icy wall and an iron will to retain what little power she has. This could have been a fascinating character around which a good film could have been built; McMurphy is just a devious little creep. (Plus, as a one-note heavy-handed, sexist symbol of oppression, I find the Ratched character offensive, but give kudos to Fletcher for managing to give her what little shadings she can.)Furthermore, I find the surface story about life in a mental ward unconvincing and the underlying symbolism about freedom and oppression dishonest. And please, lets put an end to the tired crazy-people-are-saner-than-the-sane-people nonsense; it is a tired literary cliché. As for Nicholson, he chews up the scenery; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Here, I'm unimpressed. I know this film has sparked fanatical devotion, but as far as I'm concerned, it a total fraud.",3,21,56,4 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Revenge of the Myth ...
","In the mid-1950s, the Ford Motor Co. introduced the Thunderbird, a snazzy, little sports car that made history. The '55, '56 and '57 models are revered as classics. Subsequent models made into the 1960's were bigger and gaudier, but they remained uniquely styled and rather special. By the 1970's, Ford tried to make the Thunderbird evolve into a luxury car, which meant it kept getting bigger and heavier and uglier and busier and less and less special. By the time the Thunderbird was discontinued in 1998 it bore little resemblance to the original T-Bird. The STAR WARS series is the Thunderbird of motion pictures. What started as a fun and highly entertaining vehicle with the original STAR WARS (a.k.a., A NEW HOPE), was franchised into a trilogy with a pair of heavily accessorized follow-up films (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and THE RETURN OF THE JEDI) that were still special, but provided a less joyous ride. By the time Star-master George Lucas got around to making the wholly unnecessary trilogy of prequels -- THE PHANTOM MENACE, ATTACK OF THE CLONES and THE REVENGE OF THE SITH -- he was addicted to the art of pointless excess and turned a smart sports model into an unsightly gas guzzler. Like the T-Bird, the STAR WARS films have been improved to death, their innocence mechanized into oblivion. They are noisy machines, but little else. There is a scene in SITH where it is apparent that a major character is going to slay a room full of small, innocent children. The mere thought of such a scene should inspire fear, anger or at least disbelief, but the scene is played without a shred of emotional resonance. Instead of being compelled to say 'Oh, my God, no!' one is likely to just shrug at the plot twist. It just happens. The entire film is just like that, a long unemotional exercise in mechanical wizardry. Likewise, you won't find a storm trooper accidentally bumping into a doorway in these films, because that would get a laugh, just as it did in the original film. Humor, warmth, suspense and compassion have been eliminated from the series, just as if Lucas had deemed them a computer virus to be debugged out of existence. They get in the way of his cold, computerized perfection. There are no thrills, no excitement, no fear, no joy. That is because there is nothing truly human in this entire trilogy. Though they have their counterparts in the original trilogy, the characters in Episodes I, II and III only serve a function, they don't inspire us to care about them the way we identified with Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Darth Vader, or even C3PO and R2D2. The real STAR WARS had three dimensional characters; SITH and its characters exist to perpetuate a contrived, pompous myth and a fat box office take. Even the battle sequences that are so slickly done are coldly mechanical. They are either so chaotic that it is impossible to know what is going on, or else they are jazzed up to hyper speed to the point that they lack suspense. When Luke and Vader battled with the light sabers, we saw life in jeopardy. Here, when Yoda takes on Palpatine, we don't see characters, we don't see actors, we don't even see stunt men; we see computerized special effects. It is like watching Lucas playing his own little private video game. Suspense relies on the recognition of danger, not just the coordination of action. Occasionally the prequels will let off a spark of recognition revealing the humor and charm of the originals. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi might, for instance, actually show some good cheer in a line reading. And the fleeting moment here or there with CP3O or R2D2 might generate an equally fleeting smile. Though R2D2 has also been computerized in many instances, so that the klutzy little droid we all loved now does insultingly inappropriate backflips and darts around on jets. And Yoda has been totally computerized to the point he is devoid of humanity or humor; its like watching a pod person, his quirky personality replaced with that of a cold and mean-spirited little troll. Indeed, the entire trilogy seems more akin to THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS than STAR WARS. There is not a genuine thrill of the original STAR WARS apparent until virtually the end of REVENGE OF THE SITH when Anakin is being rebuilt into Darth Vader. John Williams' original theme swells, you hear that unmistakable rasp of breath and then James Earl Jones' distinctive baritone and you find yourself thinking 'Yes! Finally, STAR WARS!' It is like seeing Ford's redesigned T-Bird in 2002; though it is only a faded glimmer of the original, it is at least stirring. And then moments later the film, and presumably the series, is over. And the gnawing feeling of perpetual disappointment is again replaced by anger as you realize that Lucas has once again cheated you out of something special.",4,11,20,6 July 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Holmes, Sherlock Holmes
","He's lean! He's mean! He's a kick-ass crime fighter and the baddest dude this side of Pickadilly Circus! He's Holmes, Sherlock Holmes! Huh?When it was announced that macho director Guy Ritchie was going to make a Sherlock Holmes movie, with the intention of turning the renown sleuth into a rough and tumble action hero, there were more than a few eyebrows raised. With the announcement that the part would be taken over by the very American, very sardonic Robert Downey Jr. further puzzlement followed. The mystery being 'Why?' Holmes is a legendary character, and his iconic image is firmly implanted in our pop culture. The continuing respect for the character is rooted in that image, not in the actual quality of the mysteries that were devised for Holmes to solve by his creator Arthur Conan Doyle. The prevailing image of Holmes as being tall, slender, somewhat solemn and the epitome of Edwardian gentlemanliness is hard to shake, whether the actor in the part plays it stoically (Basil Rathbone), neurotically (Nicol Williamson) or comedic (George C. Scott). The decision to give us a Sherlock who is violent, belligerent and of questionable hygiene is the biggest mystery in SHERLOCK HOLMES – if Ritchie didn't like the traditional Holmes, then why did he bother to make a film centered on him? In fairness, Doyle's Holmes was not above resorting to physical violence and using a firearm now and again. But those were on rare occasions, the traditional Holmes had intellect as his primary weapon and that sufficed quite nicely. Ritchie's detective comes off as a pistol-packing hooligan who frequents Fight Club matches, whose residence at 227B Baker Street could best be described as squalid and whose personal appearance could generously be called perpetually scruffy. While the traditional Holmes was of the upper class, but who could move around among the lower classes, it is unlikely that this Holmes would be comfortable or be accepted among the titled. In essence, the filmmakers have taken the less savory aspects of the Holmes adventures and moved them to the forefront, for reasons that just aren't clear. Maybe the filmmakers thought a character with genteel qualities would just be too uncommercial for modern audiences. That is rather sad. There just was no call to re-imagine Sherlock Holmes as being down and dirty.That is not to say that Downey gives a bad performance as Holmes, only that he comes off as being Holmes in name only. He gives us a passable British accent and plays the part with a degree of shifting moods. Indeed, had he not been playing Sherlock Holmes, and had instead been cast as an original character, say, an Irwin Smithers or a Nigel Butterworth, then maybe his work wouldn't seem so vaguely disappointing. A bit more of his impish sense of humor – which added so much to IRON MAN -- would have been a welcomed addition and helped ease in the character as a tongue in cheek homage.But to pretend for a moment this isn't a Sherlock saga, how is the film? Well, Holmes' attempts to sabotage the impending marriage between Jude Law's Dr. Watson and his future bride, Mary, gives the film an unexpected homo-erotic subtext that is amusing and rather sweet. Beyond that, with it's impressive sets and CGI effects, elegantly overplayed supervillain, colorful assassins, overly choreographed out-of-nowhere fight sequences and a long-winded and convoluted narrative about a super secret organization and a megalomaniac's plot to take over the world all makes the film seem less a Sherlock Holmes adventure and more like an Edwardian version of a James Bond movie. In the end, it would seem that Ritchie tried to tackle one British literary icon and inadvertently made a film about another one -- though still as a grungy and unpleasant recreation.The box office success of SHERLOCK HOLMES could inspire other nefarious re-imaginings; like Jackie Chan as martial arts master Charlie Chan. Or maybe Jean-Claude Van Damme as an intense adventurer named Hercule Poirot. I can see it now: 'She's hot! She's sexy!! She's the Hell-raising Mistress of Crime!!! Angelina Jolie IS Miss Jane Marple!!!!' Well, maybe not.",6,1,4,5 January 2010
The Good Shepherd," The Poor Little Lamb Who Has Lost His Way ...
","THE GOOD SHEPHERD is a story that has been told before, in many guises. Director Robert DeNiro and screenwriter Eric Roth attempt to disguise the story by draping it in cloak-and-dagger attire, but going undercover doesn't hide the basic narrative at all. It is the story of a man who places his devotion to his career over his duties as a family man, all the while destroying the family even as he intends to protect it. The pretense that the film is a layer by layer revelation of the history of the CIA doesn't accentuate, but distracts from the human drama, and only unnecessarily pads the film with details that are sometimes fascinating and sometimes just cliché.Matt Damon plays the fictional Edward Wilson, and the story follows this character's youthful days of semi-innocence to his rise as the head of the CIA, culminating with the Bay of Pigs incident in the early 1960's. Damon plays the part quite well, but it is a performance of determined emptiness and shallow emotion. That is, of course, the point of the character, but it is also the fatal flaw of both the role and the film. It is hard to care about someone who finds it hard to care. And like Edward, the story strays so far away, and for so long, from his family, that the emotional impact is greatly muted.The human drama is almost like bookends: we learn about how he gets sucked into marriage at the beginning and how his family gets sucked into his professional web of intrigue at the end. But for the bulk of the movie we seem to check into his family life just to let us know they are still around. And when the story does circle back around to Edward's relationship with his son, Edward Jr. (played by Eddie Redmayne), it all seems greatly rushed, with key moments edited out. It's like DeNiro looked at his watch and finally realized he had dallied too long on the cool spy stuff and had to make a mad dash to get home on time. Plus, the ponderous espionage trickery throughout only serves to make the sudden twists, turns and revelations made at the end appear to be unnecessarily contrived.The film is carefully made and DeNiro has a good eye for the camera, there's nothing too showy or too overly dramatic. And his ability to assemble a strong cast that includes Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, Billy Crudup, Timothy Hutton, John Turturro and others, certainly doesn't hurt. But the film's lack of focus leads everything astray. I suppose Edward Sr.'s descent into joyless isolation as a human being is supposed to mirror the CIA's journey from noble cause to sinister depths, and that is all well and good as far as it goes. But, ironically, by the time the film ends amid the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs mess, the message seems to be not that his career has harmed his family, but that his family has harmed his career. Like Edward, the film doesn't have its priorities straight.",4,4,6,18 January 2007
The Queen," Old Dinosaurs Learning New Tricks ...
","I have to admit that I never quite got that whole Princess Diana thing -- the awe that she inspired, and still does. I didn't hate her or anything, but I remember shortly before her infamous death I saw her on the cover of a magazine and I thought to myself 'Is there anyone on earth who should be of less interest?' Okay, she did the Cinderella bit and married into a royal family only to find the 'happily ever after' myth didn't quite pan out. A bad marriage, disapproving in-laws and a messy divorce and what did she get out of it? Untold wealth, immense fame and adoration, jet set friends and she even got to keep the royal title. Not a bad haul, I'd say. The self-pitying poor little rich girl image just didn't move me. And when she died, the whole world seemed to go into a state of frozen shock in a way that hadn't been seen since JFK was assassinated. And as the world mourned, I scratched my head in confusion.All of this is a way of me getting around to saying that going into THE QUEEN, I was more than little bit sympathetic to the royal family. The film deals with how Queen Elizabeth faced an unexpected public relations nightmare upon Diana's death and while I can't say that I was any more enamoured by the Royals than I was with Diana, I appreciate their predicament. The Golden Girl to the rest of the world was at best an ex-in-law to The Royals and at worst a disgruntled ex-employee of Her Majesty Inc. Not only did Diana seem inappreciative of all that being part of the monarchy had given her, she showed little restraint in bucking royal protocol by complaining to the press. And just when Elizabeth thought she was more or less rid of her, the so-called 'People's Princess' proves she can upstage the monarchy in death just as effectively as in life.In a wonderfully understated performance, Helen Mirren plays the Queen with an unpretentious, down-to-earth -- if a bit joyless -- directness. There is neither a trace of condescension nor satire in her approach and she invests a surprising amount of compassion in a character who is strangely lacking in passion. Her Elizabeth II wears the burden of power almost defiantly, as if she has to prove that she can, despite half a century of proof that she is up to the chore. All she expects is that everybody play by the rules, including herself -- never mind whether the rules are fair or make sense. Thus, when faced with the expectations that the rules be revised, once again, to accommodate Diana, she is not amused -- or even understanding.What the Queen never seems to grasp is that Diana was modern-day royalty -- not part of an arcane line of inherited sovereignty, but someone who is famous for being famous. A celebrity. Though the Queen claims her status as divine privilege, Diana out ranked her; her acclaim anointed by the masses, via the media. What THE QUEEN makes clear is that while the royal family really should be commended for not exploiting Diana's tragedy with insincere grief, they really had no choice but to become part of the world-wide sob-fest. However inexplicable or undeserved Diana's notoriety might have been, it was too potent to ignore.That is where Prime Minister Tony Blair comes in. Though recognizing that the monarchy is a dinosaur, Blair realizes that just having a dinosaur is something unique. And the care and feeding of a dinosaur is a delicate chore. Despite the subject matter, THE QUEEN is largely a comedy of manners, a droll and understated examination of how Blair coaxes Queen and Co. to adapt to the times in an effort to avoid extinction. Grudgingly, indignantly, Elizabeth deigns to allow Diana the royal treatment one last time. But, while public opinion may make the Queen mourn, nobody can make her cry.Despite Mirren's wonderfully dour performance, THE QUEEN is hardly a one-woman show. As Blair, Michael Sheen gives a lively and humorous performance as a man who also must adapt, evolving from someone opposed to the monarchy to one who passionately must defend the royal family and all that it entails. And James Cromwell is all impotent bluster as the perpetually outraged Prince Phillip. But curiously the most sympathetic character is Prince Charles, played by Alex Jennings; caught between two powerful and self-centered women, Charles ends up being a minor character in the film, just as he has become in reality.In the end, THE QUEEN knocks the royal family off the throne, but not in a cruel or radical way. Perhaps what made Diana so popular was that she seemed human, a trait either bred out of those born to the monarchy or a trait that they had been carefully trained to hide. Either way, I left the movie liking the royal family just a little better -- except for Diana, who I still just don't get.",8,1,2,4 February 2007
Blade Runner," Cutting edge
","Generally, I don't like voice-over narration; it tends to tell us what we are already seeing, or what should be made clear anyway in a well-written story. Yet, I prefer the original version of Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER that features narration. Read as a flat monologue by Harrison Ford, the narration is relatively minor and it is bland and lacking any sense of humor or style. And though it does provide some fresh details, it really isn't dramatically necessary. Yet, the voice-over works, I think, because it is so banal; in a film that relies heavily on style and visuals, the narration's absence of any sense of poetry grounds the film. It contrasts with the overwhelming stylistics of the film as a whole. It gives us something real -- something human -- in an overcrowded world of eye-popping fantasy.Director Scott -- as well as Ford himself -- are on the record as not liking the narrated version and when Scott got the chance to have his say on a quasi-director's cut, the studio-imposed narration was the first thing to go. And while his version, without the intruding words, is more solemnly impressive, it is also more desolate and aloof. Without the narration, we observe the action in BLADE RUNNER from a safe distance; with the narration, Ford's Rick Deckard talks to us and forces us to be his confidante. And I think that is essential to appreciating the film because otherwise it is difficult to care one way or the other about the character or his fate. One-dimensional and unsympathetic, Deckard is not the film's hero -- indeed, he is anything but heroic -- but in the end, all depends on whether he lives or dies and the fact that he has shared his thoughts with us makes all the difference.BLADE RUNNER is a strange hybrid of genres, an odd melding of the traditional film noir, with its peculiar sense of pragmatic morality, and modern sci-fi, with its darkly pessimistic and persistent distrust of both humanity and scientific progress. There is also an element of the traditional western, and its romanticizing of masculinity and individuality. Deckard is a retired cop, drawn back into service by the proverbial 'one last case.' He is a 'blade runner,' a policeman by law, but in this dark and murky vision of the future (circa 2019), he is more of a hired assassin, in reality a gunslinger or bounty hunter. His job is to track down and 'retire' a quartet of humanistic androids -- replicants -- who were genetically constructed to be slave labor on some off-planet space colony. Though they were created with built-in expiration dates and are fated to die soon anyway, the four have violently rebelled and have come to earth to try to force the corporation that created them to somehow extend their longevity.Though now considered a landmark of sci-fi cinema, BLADE RUNNER was a box office flop when it was released and was greeted with critical indifference. This is understandable; released about the same time as E.T. - THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, and on the heels of STAR WARS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the film represented a jarring difference in style and tone for audiences eager for upbeat sci-fi fantasy or thrilling matinée adventures. And this was especially true given the presence of Ford in the starring role; there is nary a trace of Indiana Jones or Han Solo in Deckard and though Ford plays the part well, it is with a dour lack of enthusiasm. Deckard has a job to do and one that he doesn't particularly like; that is the closest he comes to acting heroic. Indeed, in the end, what many may have found hard to appreciate, if they grasped it at all, is that Deckard is the film's villain, a man with no soul who seeks to kill others because they are deemed less than human.There are two other points of contention brought up by Scott's revisionist view: One is his dislike for the film's so-called 'happy ending' and the other his notion that Deckard is also a replicant (though Ford rejects this idea, insisting the character was always meant to be human). If Deckard is a replicant, the film gets an ironic twist at the end -- but it also robs the film of it's spiritual essence. The climatic moment of the story is when the last act of a dying replicant, Roy Batty, played by Rutger Hauer, is to save Deckard's life. If Batty saves Deckard because he senses he is a fellow replicant, it is an act of unity; but if he saves a human enemy, it is an act of forgiveness. As the narration explains, at death Batty loves life so much, he can't bare to take it from another. Batty receives redemption (and reveals he has a soul) by forgiving Deckard; Deckard's soul is reborn through Batty's generosity of spirit. And a beautifully ugly film about death becomes a film about the preciousness of life.The original ending, where Deckard and the replicant Rachel (Sean Young) flee to the country in the hopes of sharing a life, is optimistic, an underscoring of the idea of rebirth. It is vastly superior to Scott's preferred inconclusive ending, which suggests that the two are doomed fugitives. Though the studio-imposed 'happy ending' was no doubt a purely commercial decision, it gives the film meaning in a way Scott's pessimism can't. Scott's vision of BLADE RUNNER is like a replicant, an engineering marvel and, like a machine, he assumes it is should run with cold, empty efficiency. But just as hope is what makes the replicants human, it is it's original message of hope that gives BLADE RUNNER its humanity.",10,4,8,22 July 2007
Casino Royale," 'But you yourself are nothing so divine. Just next in line '
","You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how the remake of CASINO ROYALE rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: CASINO ROYALE: At least it suggests class, which oddly is the one thing this film seems to be trying to avoid. 7 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: The first wrinkle in this so-called reboot of the series is that it begins in black-and-white. Whether intended as an homage to the 50s TV version of the story or just a clumsy reference to THE WIZARD OF OZ, the monochromatic flashback is hardly original. Since the whole film is essentially a flashback, the gimmick here seems self-consciously self-important. 5 points.Opening Credits: Daniel Kleinman foregoes the traditional optical tricks and gaudy montages and actually goes retro with an animated opening. Cleverly using a gambling motif, he turns crosshairs into roulette wheels, spades into lethal weapons and hearts into puddles of blood, equating the spy game with a game of skill and chance. Really nice. 10 points.Theme Song: Paradoxically it is entitled 'You Know My Name,' odd since this is supposed to be Bond before he was a legend. Chris Cornell's opening theme provides a strong beat but the lyrics are rambling nonsense ('When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me? By the merciless eyes of deceit?' Huh?). Still, if it were performed in the seductive tones of the best Bond ballads (Shirley Bassey, where are you?), rather than Cornell's blaring screech, it might have been better. 6 point.'Bond, James Bond': Supposedly the youngest actor to play Bond, Daniel Craig nonetheless looks older than either Connery or Moore in their final Bond epics. There is just something unpleasant about Craig's appearance, which makes his 007 neither likable nor sympathetic nor even particularly memorable. Craig is stiff and cold and prone to mumbling in monotones. Unfortunately, that seems to be just what the filmmakers wanted. Go figure. But, there is the hint that the style, charm and wit will materialize in future adventures. God, I hope so. We'll take a gamble and advance him 4 points.Bond Babes: As Vesper Lynd, Eva Green certainly isn't the voluptuous temptress that Ursula Andress created in the 1967 spoof, but instead gives us a character who is smart, witty and beautiful in a realistic way. Indeed, she hardly deserves to be classified as a mere 'Bond Girl.' But, the film traps her in an unbelievable plot twist and an even more unbelievable romance with Bond. But you can't blame Green, she's the best thing about the film. 10 points.Bond Villain: It would seem the strongest qualification for Mads Mikkelsen being the villainous LeChiffre is that he is even less attractive than Craig. Not that it matters, since the problem is that he does nothing with the character. In fairness, the role was played previously by Peter Lorre (in the 1954 TV play) and Orson Welles (in the 1967 spoof) and they really didn't do much with the character either. But, at least, they were Peter Lorre and Orson Welles. But then, the character is basically an accountant with a gambling problem and that isn't much to build on. Mikkelsen's LeChiffre cries blood and apparently has asthma... and that is about it. 4 points.Bond Baddies: Thugs and terrorists seem to be around every corner and fights break out at regular intervals, but they all have a generic quality and are totally forgettable. 0 points.Sinister Plot: LeChiffre is the moneyhandler for the bad guys (this time terrorists rather than the Soviets) and his gambling habit prompts him to foolishly borrow funds from his clients, who aren't happy when he loses big and can't reimburse. Thus he faces off with Bond over the poker table to win enough to cover his debts before he is eliminated. It is a very silly plot and yet possibly a clever metaphor for the way governments gamble and bluff their way through diplomacy. Still, if Bond wants LeChiffre dead, why doesn't he just shoot him? 6 points.Production values: For all the jabbering about introducing a new sense of realism into the series, the extravagant stunts are just as ridiculous as ever. But removing the humor from the story doesn't make it serious and denying the self-awareness that the humor exists is not realism. Once more we are getting a comic book farce that doesn't have the good grace to be honest about its absurdity. 5 points.Bonus Points: One of the more annoying features of the last few Bonds has been Judi Dench as 'M.' Dame Judi opted to play the bureaucrat as stern, petty, condescending and just plain rude, berating James at every turn. And though they have given the boot to 'Q' and Moneypenny, they opted to instead reboot Dench's insufferable 'M' into a kinder, gentler despot. Her 'M' is still a bully, but she seems to have some unexplained respect for the new Bond, even though he is ruthless and at times incompetent. 5 points for giving Dench a more complex role, minus 5 points for the inconsistency.Summary: I fail to see the point of all the hullabaloo about this being a rebirth of Bond. Take away the five minutes spent on James earning his 007 status and everything else is the same old same old.. With its accent on violence and sadism, the tone is more Tarantino than Playboy, but that is how the series has been evolving -- for worse more than better -- for the last two decades.Bond-o-meter Rating: 57 points out of 100",6,16,32,20 November 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," 'I'll go to your room, but you'll have to seduce me.'
","Conventional wisdom suggests that when an American recipe is adapted into a Latin-style dish, the resulting feast should be a bit more exotic, thanks to spices, salsa, peppers and a greater tolerance by Latins for that which is decidedly hotter. Certainly, that was the promise that came with Woody Allen's first attempt at making a movie in Spain. The buzz heralding the American premiere of VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA had it that the film would include a daring 'menage a trois' featuring Scarlett Johansson, Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, with an added incentive being a particularly titillating liplock between Scarlett and Penelope. But anyone taken in by such advance P.R. would have done well to recall the similar word-of-mouth that preceded Stanley Kubrick's achingly over-hyped EYES WIDE SHUT, another artsy epic that promised taboo-busting sexuality from a director with no prior skill for, or interest in, any sort of erotica.As it happens, Cruz and Johansson do smooch a quickie, but really do nothing that Madonna wouldn't try on an awards show. And other than this kiss, the sexuality in the film is low-key at best and simply off screen most of the time. We have to take Johansson's word that there is a 'trois' in this 'menage,' because Woody certainly doesn't show much of anything that might be considered shocking.Indeed, the decor may be contemporary Latin, but the cuisine itself is warmed over specials from the Woodman's standard deli menu. It is Manhattan-lite -- and low-cal at that. That's not to say that VCB isn't edible, just a bit familiar. A serving of pseudo-intellectual chatter, a heaping helping of romantic dissatisfaction with a side order of indecision, all sweetened with witty one-liners and a gentle sprinkle of cynicism. VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA is one of Allen's better recent efforts, but it tastes strangely pre-packaged and microwave ready.Twenty-somethings Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Johansson) take a vacation in Barcelona to see the sights and to 'ooh' and 'ahh' over the art work at the museums. But they hardly get their bags unpacked before they are approached by a famous painter named Juan Antonio (Bardem), who invites them to fly off to another Spanish city for a weekend threeway. Cristina eagerly says yes, while Vicky reluctantly tags along. The threeway tryst doesn't quite come off -- carnally speaking, but eventually it is the already-engaged Vicky who ends up doing a one-nighter with Juan Antonio. But Cristina hangs in there and soon moves in with the artist. Juan Antonio's homicidal/suicidal ex-wife, Maria Elena (Cruz) suddenly shows up as well. Complicated love triangles are promised, but Allen's script only sets up romantic complications that he has no interest in resolving. This is a film made up mostly of propositions and exposition and precious little copulation.As for making the film in Barcelona, that springs less from artistic inspiration and more from financial convenience. There's little here that couldn't have happened in Woody's old stomping grounds of Manhattan. Other than a few music selections and some fiery conversation between Bardem and Cruz (who steal the movie), there is little on hand to remind the viewer that the movie was filmed in Spain. Even the totally unnecessary (and annoying) narration is provided by a stern male Anglo voice. And for that matter, this is a film with two female protagonists, so why doesn't it have a female narrator? Possibly Woody didn't even think about it -- indeed, the narration seems like a dramatic shortcut to avoid putting too much effort into actually filming extra scenes.As always, VCB is a polished production: the acting is solid, much of the dialogue crisp and the look of the film is slick and professional. But the whole thing is so uninspired. Even within his relatively narrow range of interests, Allen's movies have long been remarkably inventive and he has stubbornly tried to avoid the cliché. Now, he is falling back on his own clichés, doing nothing more than the bare minimum to get the job done. Efficiency is not necessarily a virtue. And though Woody seems to be covering new territory with his recent extended European vacation, the ground he covers isn't dramatic, only geographic.",7,1,6,15 September 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Stupid is as Stupid Dies
","John McClane is, I assume, the poor man's answer to James Bond. Perhaps that is his appeal; the proverbial 'Everyman' whose innate ability to survive gives him quasi-superhero status, a regular joe who somehow reveals remarkable brilliance and an indestructible nature whenever the need arises. He's Bond without the sophistication; Indiana Jones without the exotic nostalgia; Batman without the cape or the utility belt.Yet, as such, he is a man of action and certainly not of personality. As personified by Bruce Willis in the DIE HARD films, McClane has remarkably little depth or charm. Willis swaggers through the films with his trademark smirk and a catalogue of mildly amusing one-liners, giving McClane what little color he has. As Willis returned to the character in LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, arguably the best of the series, the McClane character was described as Willis' signature role, which certainly sells the prolific actor short. But if the measure of an action hero is whether he would be just as interesting without the derring-do then I don't think McClane would past the test. McClane is only as interesting as the stunt team and CGI special effects allow him to be.Willis himself is a much underrated and underappreicated actor. The right material and the right character shows him to be capable of giving performances of remarkable subtlety (THE SIXTH SENSE, NOBODY'S FOOL, UNBREAKABLE) as well as sharp comic skill (DEATH BECOMES HER). But when he allows himself to be pulled back into action hero roles (not just in the DIE HARD films, but in junk like ARMAGEDD0N and HUDSON HAWK), he runs the risk of following Burt Reynolds' path into shameless self-parody. That's not to say that Willis doesn't work hard in LIVE FREE, only that for all of his (and his stunt team's) strenuous running, jumping, fighting and shooting, he isn't given much opportunity to be anything more than Bruce Willis dying hard to get a paycheck.LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is, of course, a stupid movie. All the DIE HARD movies are just plain stupid: McClane stumbles into elaborate plots that don't make a lot of sense, inexplicably ends up in the center of the mayhem and shows unexpected skill as the only man who can possibly save the day. You know, all the things that we'd expect of James Bond, but not of a lowly police detective. Though the sinister plot at the center of LIVE FREE is an attempt to control America by taking over all the country's computers, hardly a plot that seems to promise much action; the comic book violence and high tech mayhem still manages to push the limit. McClane races all over the Eastern Seaboard as cars crash, buildings explode and various villains die more gruesomely than hard.And there's not much else there; what little effort there's been to give McClane a personality and a life was used up in the first DIE HARD, with the subsequent films focusing on blowing things up real good. That seems to be all that the fans of these films really want, so why bother with anything else? His superhero credentials having been established, there isn't even much attempt to question why McClane repeatedly finds himself in such dire circumstances; it's just taken for granted.But, it would have been nice had they attempted to shoehorn some semblance of a credible backstory into the film, something to act as a cushion between the special effects and non-stop action. We do meet his rebellious teenaged daughter, though as played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead she's a cipher, forgotten for most of the film until she needs daddy to save her at the end. More interest is shown in establishing a father figure relationship between McClane and a computer geek (nicely played by Justin Long) who gets sucked into being McClane's sidekick -- though I can't help but wonder why the filmmakers didn't make the computer geek character McClane's son (or for that matter his daughter) and thus give McClane some genuine motivation and emotional involvement, something real, in the otherwise far-fetched story.As is, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is an adrenalin rush of elaborate, slickly executed, and not often believable, stunts. It's often funny, though I can't say it is all that much fun. It's just another day at work for a superhero.",6,2,5,8 July 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Four Hobbits of Highly Destructive Nonsense
","The beauty of a fable is that it is short, poetic, insightful and morally to the point. I guess THE LORD OF THE RINGS saga doesn't count as a fable, since it is none of those things. It does have the simplest (or flimsiest) of premises. The protagonist, Frodo, a Hobbit, a small creature in a big world, has to destroy a golden ring which -- for reason that are unclear -- possesses a great deal of evil. This involves a journey through Middle Earth, which includes an interminable number of obstacles, not the least of which are a ridiculous number of subplots and extraneous secondary characters. Peter Jackson's three-part, 10 hour-plus spectacle is either a masterwork of modern technology or a sample of how CGI has become a curse on the medium. I vote for the latter. As long as Jackson keeps focused on the Hobbits -- Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin -- and their more normal sized companion/protectors, the trio of films is fairly intriguing. But the basic storyline is upstaged repeatedly for giant battle scenes that subvert and belittle the moral battle at the heart of the film. And large armies of computer generated soldiers killing other large armies of computer generated soldiers is neither very much fun, nor very interesting. Just busy, noisy and confusing. Jackson certainly has a gift for cluttering up the screen with chaos.Despite the assumption that this is a family film based on material from a perennial young readers' favorite, this is one of the most violent films that I have ever seen. The brutality, while remarkably and unbelievably bloodless, is nonetheless unrelenting.I have to admit the scope of the film is impressive, as was undertaking the massive project in the first place. But, seeing as how this is likely to be the mythological/cinematic touchstone for a generation of filmgoers, I really wish these films had more substance. This is filmmaking for the video game generation: mindless action, mindless violence, mindless noise.

The Thin Red Line," War is bad...yeah, we get the message.
","It is the curious notion that seemingly every director who undertakes making a war film, not only feels the need to state the obvious -- that war is bad -- but must also try to make it seem as though it is his original insight. This shallow, condescending attitude is but a minor flaw in the long-winded, chaotic jumble that Terrence Malick has served up in THE THIN RED LINE.I am more than willing to assume that Malick had the best of intentions, but that is little consolation for the incoherent mess that is the result. Reportedly chopped down from an original running time of 6 hours, the resulting three-hour marathon of simplistic ideas and pretentious metaphors adds up to little of any consequence and doesn't even offer a compelling narrative to justify the effort. Like a latter day AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS, Malick has assembled a notable cast of big name stars, whose only function apparently was to help generate financing for the spectacle. Plus, Malick's reputation is such that major stars are eager to work for him, just for the bragging rights for having done so. Yet, here they are given little to do within the film other than to contribute insignificant cameos. But then again it is hard to see where anybody in the film is there for any reason other than to be a cameo. No one character is given any real identity, let alone material to play.The vague, almost generic, storyline is divorced from any sense of the political realities of war, just as the characters are reduced to playing one-note versions of one war archetype or another. The narrative jumps from phoney-baloney 'poetic' moments to poorly staged battle scenes with little continuity or flow. Dream sequences or flashbacks or whatever they are supposed to be are littered throughout with little regard as to who they refer or their relevance to the story. The film is an editorial mess. This is just plain bad film-making. Period. Pretentious monologues and pretty shots of nature cannot hide the bumbling incompetence that is the sum total of this failure. All the desperate rationalizations about it being a poetic statement can't overshadow the numbing banality of its vision.THE THIN RED LINE is a big bloody bore.",1,11,21,6 April 2004
Sin City," Urban blight...
","The trick is not in creating a unique world vision for a movie; any director with a competent cinematographer and set designer (or computer technician) can accomplish that. The trick is sustaining that vision for the course of the movie; making the style of the movie to be more than just a gimmick. This is obvious in films like NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, BLADE RUNNER, SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, or even in more mainstream films like CHICAGO or DICK TRACY -- or even YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. The style is part of the story, not something that overwhelms it. Robert Rodriguez, to his credit, at least tries to achieve this in the comic book epic SIN CITY, but in the end, style is the only point to the film. Take away the striking images and there is precious little -- or, at least, precious little that's worthwhile -- left to define the film.Rodriguez apparently is very successful in replicating the bleak, gaudy, horrific nightmare world of Frank Miller's cruel and shallow graphic novels; the question is whether it was worth his effort. No matter how masterfully done Miller's art work might be, romanticizing evil, cruelty and violence can't make something that is intrinsically ugly suddenly beautiful. Likewise, the jazzed up facade of Rodriguez's dark, soulless fantasy can only temporarily hide its utter lack of humanity. Beneath its Gothic shell, SIN CITY is little more than a heartless, decaying corpse.As in Kerry Conran's SKY CAPTAIN, SIN CITY uses blue screen techniques and computer graphics to meticulously create a unique worldly vision. Unlike SKY CAPTAIN, with its B-movie-inspired vision of cliffhanger heroics, SIN CITY is a morally muddy and sexually twisted wasteland, as devoid of heroes as it is of sunlight. The only thing black and white about the film is its cinematography; and, though it imitates Miller's style, it seems the only real purpose for the monochromatic imagery is that the selective use of superimposed color makes the film's liberal use of blood seem all the more lurid in its redness -- or whiteness or yellowness. Rodriguez's stark visuals grab your attention, for five or ten minutes; but quickly become as tediously pointless as the three turgid tales that unfold within.The film relies on the good-bad-guy versus the bad-bad-guy code of ethics. In an obvious attempt to imitate PULP FICTION, Rodriguez gives us three sleazy story lines that vaguely interlock and unfold with a skewed chronology. Thus we get three good-bad-guys -- played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen -- each of whom is an amoral, sadistic, cold-blooded, misanthropic and psychotic killer. They are, however, paragons of virtue compared to their adversaries -- played by Nick Stahl, Elijah Wood and Benicio Del Toro, as bad-bad-guy killers who are even more amoral, sadistic, cold-blooded, misanthropic and psychotic. The fact that the tissue-paper thin personalities of the good-bad-guys are supposed to give them complexity is hardly sufficient to actually make us care about them. Though each are the lesser of two evils, they are evil just the same.The stories are a crude and gruesome mix of sadomasochistic violence and soft-core porn. As envisioned by Miller and Rodriguez (with the dubious help of Quentin Tarantino), SIN CITY is a dysfunctional adolescent's fantasy, polluted by soured adult nihilism. This empty, grotesque landscape, seems to be what might exist in the mind of a frighteningly disturbed teenager: The characters who aren't presented as sideshow freaks are reduced to the level of vile stereotypes. Authority figures such as police, politicians and clergy are corrupt and ruthless. Women are sexually provocative caricatures who exist either to be used and abused and often violently killed, or are dangerous, scantily clad Amazon warriors with a bloodlust for emasculation. And being male is measured by the ability to endure violence with superhuman endurance, while vanquishing rivals with a casual disregard for mercy -- with castration being a preferred style of vengeance. If there is an underlying theme in SIN CITY it is a pitiable fear of sexuality on all levels.Like so much that passes for stylish coolness in the Tarantino-influenced cinema, SIN CITY is really just a veg-a-matic hodgepodge of pop culture junk. It combines the hard-boiled narrative stylings of forties noir, the automotive snazziness of the fifties, the crude self-aware campiness of the sixties, the cinematic cynicism of the seventies and the slasher movie savagery of the eighties with the trendy Tarantino-inspired ironic sadism of the nineties. Yet, Rodriguez, no doubt, believes he is serving up something shockingly original -- and some critics seem to foolishly agree. But for all of its flamboyant attempts to shock and amaze, SIN CITY is little more than an extended pop culture slum; and its most profound feature isn't the look of this glamorized ghetto, but the unchallenged stench of moral decay that seeps up from the sewer that is the true heart of these desolate and mean streets.",1,9,22,5 April 2005
Saboteur," Heading North by Northeast ...
","In the course of the unlikely events that unfold in Alfred Hitchcock's 1942 adventure, SABOTEUR, the prototypical Wrongly Accused Man (along with the obligatory Cool Blonde) ends up on a circus train where Hitchcock and his writers serve up an impromptu social studies lesson on the basics of American democracy. The fate of the fugitive lovers comes down to a vote of a microcosm of our political system as defined by a carload of circus performers. Those voting include Siamese twins, bound together by nature and separated by an innate need to disagree (Republicans and Democrats?); a 'fascist' dwarf (the reactionary far right?); The Fat Lady, whose sympathy for both sides of the arguments render her neutral and noncommittal (the pacifist and indecisive far left?) and The Thin Man, a bony old codger who knows the right thing to do, but feels compelled to bend to the will of the majority (Uncle Sam?). The final vote falls to The Bearded Lady, an androgynous old woman who lets her emotions rule over her common sense (the average American voter, perhaps?).It is a mildly satirical scene that may or may not carry any real, great meaning, but its absurdity suggests what SABOTEUR could have been. Couple it with the film's famed finale, the tense, yet utterly ridiculous tussle atop the Statue of Liberty, and you can see the possibilities. SABOTEUR is to some degree an example of wartime patriotic propaganda, yet there is a subversive undercurrent to the tale: The villains are disguised as family men and do-gooder socialites; the American populous is defined as sideshow freaks; and the Cool Blonde is a model, a pretty and shallow tool of capitalism. And the hapless wrongly accused hero on the run is, on the one hand, the epitome of strong, resourceful American individualism, as well as being the stereotypical loner who is betrayed by the system.Even so, SABOTEUR is not so much satirical as just silly. Though Hitchcock plays it all more or less straight, adding but a few darkly whimsical touches here and there, the blend of humor and thrill don't quite gel. Though the story seems to be a trial run for similar themes he would recycle in NORTH BY NORTHWEST, one gets the feeling that it would all have been better as a straightforward comedy, such as Bob Hope starring in MY FAVORITE SABOTEUR.The story involves Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, a worker at a wartime munitions factory which is a target for sabotage. Though Kane should be a key witness in identifying the actual saboteur, his information is casually disregarded by the none-too-bright police and he becomes the prime player in a cross country chase, which ironically goes North by Northeast, as Kane heads form Los Angeles to Washington D.C. This is not top-drawer Hitchcock, as evidenced by the B-list cast of actors. The film is not helped much by the rather bland performance by Cummings, still a decade or so from the sitcom fame that would allow him to develop a genuine comedic charm.And Hitchcock runs into what is a standard problem in many of his films, the question of 'Why doesn't he just go to the police?' The prototypical Hitchcock adventure finds an innocent man who is forced to solve a crime and track down the villains (usually with the help of the blonde love interest), because he can't trust the authorities. Such plots, if you examine them too closely, are often ludicrous and contrive extreme complications to keep the hero running from the cops and toward the bad guys. It is the primary weakness of SABOTEUR that so much hinges on so little: there is just no logical reason for Kane not to go to the police and not even much reason for the police to be after him in the first place. It is to the director's credit that he gets the action moving along so nicely with such little motivation. I suspect that the man on the run plot premise was already so ingrained into the fabric of film storytelling even in 1942, that moviegoers just didn't bother to question the logic.",6,6,11,31 May 2005
Gangs of New York," Slumming
","Martin Scorsese's big, confused, drab and ultimately empty slice of American history seems to be yet another attempt by the director to show how violent and ruthless men are and how corrupt the American dream is.
Played out on a giant, rambling set showing lower Manhattan during the Civil War (and filmed, ironically enough in Italy), Scorsese once again reduces human intercourse to the level of gang warfare, vengeance, power plays and simple greed. Heaven forbid he show any aspect of the American landscape that would hint at anything but the basest of motives.
The story, consisting on the most cliched elements of a love triangle and a trite revenge melodrama, serves as the backdrop for Scorsese's depiction of the most squalid aspects of life in New York City; and from that aspect, the film is a set designers dream. The seedy look of the film is admirable. But as an examination of America as the great melting pot, his old immigrant vs. new immigrant saga comes off as simplistic, at best.Plus the long-winded and convoluted narrative is populated with one-dimensional characters, not the least of which are those played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz. Though widely praised, the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, as the films oversized villain, is stiff, flat and unconvincing. This wannabe epic was desperately in need of a couple more rewrites before filming should have commenced in order to give it a compelling story, any strong characters or a real reason to exist in the first place.",4,2,8,5 March 2004
Shark Tale," Something fishy is going on...
","SHARK TALE is an animated feature about fish and sharks and other creatures that live under the sea. So, why does Don Feinberg, the shark character voiced by Peter Falk, sing 'The Wind Beneath My Wings.' I mean in a film all about fish, shouldn't he be singing 'The Wave Beneath My Fins?' There is no wind and they have no wings and logically these characters would not even know what 'wind' and 'wings' are. And when everybody is celebrating life at the Whale Wash, why do they all sing 'At the Car Wash' and not 'At the Whale Wash?' It would seem that they don't have cars and shouldn't even know what one is either. Could it be that funny parodies of the songs would be less marketable on the soundtrack CD? There is no real logic in this fish world. One creature is seen pouring tea into a cup, but none goes in because it disappears into the ocean water. Which is only logical, so why was he pouring tea in the first place? But other fish are into graffiti art and their canned spray paint isn't effected by the water. Oscar, the protagonist voiced by Will Smith, longs to live in a penthouse so the he can enjoy the view, but he is a fish in gravity-defying water so he can swim up and enjoy any view he wants, any time he wants. Plus, why would the said penthouse require an elevator? These are, admittedly, silly, insignificant details individually, but put together they are examples of just what is wrong with the film. It goes to extremes to make the fishy world on view a parallel universe to ours, like say, SHREK; while at the same time suggesting it is an unseen part of our world, like say, FINDING NEMO. The action mostly takes place in what appears to be a submerged human world, most notably New York City in general and Times Square in particular. But if it is a sunken part of the human world, why is it implied that this a uniquely fishy world? The film can't make up its mind: The Coca-Cola sign in Times Square reads Coral-Cola, yet Will Smith's Oscar brags about owning a PlayStation. (Did PlayStation pay for a plug and Coca-Cola didn't?) And apparently this civilization has electricity, but how it functions under water isn't clear. It is annoying that the film can't decide just what universe it exists in. Is this a fish built society (then why are there knobs on the door?) or is it a man-made world that has fallen to a watery grave like the Titanic (then what caused New York City to sink?)Likewise, the film suffers from a muddled story line. Basically, we are given a Damon Runyonesque tale of small-time hustlers and gangsters on the streets of New York (which raises the question of whether swimming fish would even need streets). But into this Guys and Dolls milieu we are also given hip-hop characters and hoods right out of GOODFELLAS. It is an everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink approach, which should make it funny in an AIRPLANE! sort of way, but instead the inconsistencies are just annoying. It is like nobody thought this through; this isn't inspired chaos, just confusion.The art and animation is just fine, exactly what we have come to expect from DreamWorks, but it is betrayed by a trite and sloppy screenplay. A simple test would be to ask 'Would this story work without the animation, with real actors?' I don't think it would. Even with -- especially with this cast. Other than Falk, whose part is a slight cameo, the only strong vocal performance is given by Martin Scorsese, and overrated director and an underrated actor. His hyperactive, twitchy vocal patterns were made for cartoon voicers. The rest of the cast -- Will Smith, Robert DeNiro, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie and Renee Zellweger -- all seem to be examples of stunt casting; none give their characters a distinctive voice to match a distinctive character, like Ellen DeGeneres in FINDING NEMO or Eddie Murphy in SHREK or Holly Hunter in THE INCREDIBLES or Robin Williams in ALADDIN.The stakes have risen; remarkable films like TOY STORY 1 & 2, MONSTER'S INC. and SHREK 2 with their mix of artistry and intelligence, make it harder to accept that excellent animation can compensate for poorly crafted storytelling. SHARK TALES is well intentioned, with a moral about honesty and acceptance -- one shark confesses to being a closet vegetarian, with being gay the suggested subtext -- but the happily ever after, Capraesque finale seems fake. SHARK TALE is a well made film, but it is a small fish in an increasingly larger ocean.",5,1,6,12 February 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O Brother, Gimme a Break!
","You know a film is in sorry shape when the film makers stage a Klan rally as though it were a half-time show at a football game and still can't make it funny or interesting. The characters in this film are sorry stereotypes (they're from the south, so naturally they are presented as morons; the oracle is, of course, a blind man; the politicians are fat and crooked, etc.). The story wants to ramble, but the direction is sloppy and clumsy. The film's only asset is the music. I am not a Coen brothers fan; I find their work cold, mechanical and lacking simple humanity. That is fine for a stylish film noir like Blood Simple, but cruel, almost sadistic in films like Raising Arizona or Fargo. They are akin to Kubrick (not necessarily a compliment) in that they have neither the desire nor the talent to explore human nature or emotions in anything but the most superficial manner. Thinking about O Brother, I can't help but think that Robert Altman, in his prime, could have made something fascinating and wonderful out of this material. As is, the film is typically Coen, empty and flashy and absolutely forgettable.",3,2,4,17 January 2001
