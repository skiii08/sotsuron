Casablanca," Timeless romantic drama.
","A timeless romantic drama. Terrific lines and sentiments make an unintended classic - I believe that it was written as the film was made. It can be seen many times without losing its magic. The mixture of courage and cynicism of Bogart keep it fresh. It doesn't seem to age (c.f., the English war-time equivalent 'Brief Encounter').",10,0,0,2 April 2002
