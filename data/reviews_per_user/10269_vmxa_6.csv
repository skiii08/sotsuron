Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Too slow, no longer campy.
","I enjoyed volume one and saw the reviews that claimed #2 was super. I was in agony after about the first 10 minutes. It was so boring and slow. The music was very annoying. The only song I like was the remake of the Zombies 'shes not there'.The black and white concept to reflect back on the ole martial arts movies, was fine the first time, but did not add anything for me.I really did not like the snake bit at all. The first volume I was able to get into the playfulness of the movie, but the second dish was like the extra helping of food. It just did not work and I started getting sick.In the end the only one in the movie that I found of any interest was Bill. The rest of the crew was over the top.",Null,3,7,4 July 2004
Training Day," It was hard to watch, just too ridiculous.
","The idea that anyone would add an untested person to a hit squad on day one can only fly in the movies. I understand the contempt that many have for the police, but could they not make this in any way that I could accept it? Bad cops, yes moronic one no thanks. Build up to the corruption, that we can buy. Must all movies have those cliche scenes where the hero gives the bad his chance to jump him? At least they skipped the I dropped my gun bit. While I am at it, can we stop with the outrageous come backs from a beating that would leave one without the means to retaliate? It was not a horrible movie and had talented actors, but I could not get past the main thesis.",Null,39,80,5 August 2002
Spider-Man 2," This put me to sleep and made me thing it was the 50's again
","I am not going not spend much time on this as I felt I wasted enough already. The first hour and 20 minutes was so painful. Silly bits of humor that were funny to little girls and people in the 50's.The tumbling/stumbling of the broom closet, right out of the three stooges. I remember watching sapping movie in the 50's and they were OK, but I was a preteen then, so it to be expected.I understand why they think it is justified for spidey to lie, but I hate it when it makes no sense. He is talking to this girl (not attractive either) and you know he is going to say he does not love her, why?Can't he be mature enough to respect her and say, yes, but he is not going to act on it?Why would it be so hard for the police to shot this octo man, who by the way does not have 8 legs. Oh well, it is just more of the infantile writing. If I want mindless action, I do not need so much tripe.",1,14,31,11 December 2004
X-Men," I lost interest about half way into it
","I won't waste time on this movie review. I just found that I did not care about any of the characters in the film.When the Pyro character decided to not sit at the kids table, that was the point I felt it was just too much. Too many heros and if you do not follow them, you have no idea what each can do and why.It started off badly for me when another immature person, thought it was ok to in danger people to make a political statement. It went down hill from there.I am not fond of characters that have what appears to be no limits to what they can do, it was in a word childish.",Null,2,4,21 January 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Furious is what I am after paying to rent this movie
","This was very slow. Lots of time spent on boring people and little action. Brand new story line, not. I think we have see this hero a few hundred times by now in many settings and most were written better than this one.",3,1,3,30 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," I was disappointed and was wishing it would end.
","I am not going to do a detailed report on this, but I own them all and will not be watching this one again.It was very boring and could have been reduced to about 30 minutes. The repeated betraials were repetitious. The only part that was of interest was the battle scenes.By the way am I the only one that is tired of dainty females besting males in sword battle? When was the last time a 100 woman kicked the crap out of a 200 pound anything? Broadsword battles are about strength, as if she could cut through the monsters neck, please.The ending seemed to go on forever. I really do not understand why people found this worthy. The first two were much better.",Null,4,8,26 May 2004
