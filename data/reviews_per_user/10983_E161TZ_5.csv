Blade Runner 2049," Loved it - was not bored
","Being honest, I found the original a bit boring, but I loved this film, from start to finish I was hooked.",10,1,15,7 June 2019
The Witch," Disturbing
","Wow, scary and disturbing. Had no idea what to except, acted superbly by all the actors young and old. Very atmospheric through out.",8,1,3,2 August 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Loved it from start to finish
","Accents come in and out, so don't get hung up on these, Judi Dench was awful, another actor should have been cast in my opinion and given the chance. But this I have to say is very good. I have read the book over and over again, I have watched the Albert Finney and David Suchet versions plenty, but I did enjoy this too. Visually it is stunning, the train is magnificent, superb.",10,4,21,7 June 2019
Creed II," Enjoyable
","It's good, a touch of the past and the new. Would I watch this film again, 'yes', if I said 'no' I would not have given it an 8/10. Nothing will ever match the original 4 but this is good, Creed was good, so this but it's just different.",8,0,1,4 July 2019
Incredibles 2," Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!
","This is the best film I have watched in the whole of 2018 and I think it will be the best film I've watched this entire decade. I've waited nearly 14 years for this sequel and it did not disappoint. It's just a family who happen to be superheroes, just going about an ordinary life, paying bills, going to school, taking out the trash, doing homework etc, the graphics, music, design, editing, special effects etc, etc, etc are awesome, simply awesome, as soon as it finished I wanted to watch it again it was that good. Take it for what it is, it's the best spy, superhero, family film you will watch, I finish my review by saying this, I wish I was super! Enjoy this film!",10,2,5,30 July 2018
