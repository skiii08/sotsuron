Resident Evil: Afterlife," just special effects
","As many of the reviews say the director merely concerned about 3D effects, so it's not necessary to dig up in deep content and substance. A lot of plot holes, silly phrases, incoherent scenes, stupid dialog,,, and the counts grow every time I try to remember the movie since it is so difficult, given the fact that I felt asleep after the first 30 minutes.Even though I'm not a fan of these RE series, I still see the useless mechanism of this muggy cake. Then, I ask myself this: How do million of fans feel about this meaningless flick??? A TOTAL LETDOWN FOR SURE !!! I would describe the movie in terms of all the errors any viewer can find. But like I inferred at the beginning, there's no underlying importance through the all so called 'Resident evil: afterlife'.",1,12,21,27 November 2010
