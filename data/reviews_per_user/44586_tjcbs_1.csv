Vertigo," Just another overrated old movie
","I decided to see this movie because I was interested in getting into Hitchcock and a friend was making a fuss about it. First of all, this already long movie feels even longer. The first half is nothing more than a drawn out courtship, with some supernatural elements thrown in. I feel like i was watching James Steward drive his car for at least half an hour.But the kicker is that the movie's 'secret' is given away long before the climax of the film! So when the main character finally realizes what is going on I was thinking'So what, I already knew that!'An ok, but flawed and overhyped movie.",3,14,32,24 January 2001
