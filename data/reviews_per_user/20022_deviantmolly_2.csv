The Hangover," mostly for guys
","Call me in the minority, but this is a guys movie.The story revolves around these three guys, their trip to Las Vegas and all the trouble they get into. This includes a Mike Tyson appearance, a lion, and some inappropriate urination.Okay, there were some funny moments, but I couldn't help but think that this probably had a bunch of boys writing it.They might have gotten some women's feedback.There were some funny parts, for sure.My friends feel differently. They find the whole thing hilarious. Maybe they're right.",6,2,3,26 November 2013
The Hunger Games," better than the book
","I thought this was excellent. Exciting and the people playing the characters who have long been in my head (ever since reading the book) perfectly fit their roles.I would have never guessed Woody could pull it off, but he did! And the woman who played Effie was SO GOOD.I've heard some people complain that this was too violent, well too bad. It was supposed to be. These people are fighting for their lives! By the time it was over, I was sweating. The movie made me forget that I had read the book. It was the same, but different. In a good way.If you haven't read the book, check out the movie.",9,2,9,26 November 2013
