It," Why are the Muschietti's allowed to make movies? NO!
","Alright, because Andy Muschietti made a 3 minute short film a few years ago automatically qualifies him as someone who has the knowledge and wits to create a horror film? Are you kidding me? This was a horrible attempt at something that had amazing potential. When you put a liberal- feminist sibling duo as the lead creatives to a beloved novel that for so long has waited for a true adaptation you're going to get nothing but complete horse sh*t. And that's what you got with 'IT. Although some visuals were, I have to admit, breathtaking (extreme wide shots, establishing shots, the detail within the environment, cinematography... etc.), sadly many points in the characteristics of the Loser's Club were unfortunately missed or briefly mentioned (or not even) -- (Bill being a creative type (stories), Mike's interest in Derry (hardly given the light) that would open the door to him staying in Derry as an adult, Eddie's full-blown medical dependence and what happens when he lacks of it, building something together (dam) to form trust and metaphorically establish a sense of unity in accomplishing something when they work together... etc.). I understand that the dam building would have been a little outdated (haha), but the filmmakers could have created something else to fit within that 80s time period -- which was probably the poor attempt at cleaning Bev's blood splattered bathroom as a group (excluding Mike/Richie). The acting was good -- you can really tell the super experienced kid actors to the rookie ones -- the dialogue was perfect and the kiddos did a fantastic job giving that close/comfortable feel within the group (to some extent)-- but witnessing them come together I really didn't feel all that much. They just were. There wasn't that 'Stand By Me' or coming of age feel as advertised - that would have been perfect if the 'dam' aspect was put in. They just happen and because of that you don't see the care and love they have for one another -- that build up. Bill mostly just orders around rather than have the group feel compassion/remorse for what he's dealing with and therefore wanting to stand together and help. The characters also fail to see how special they are as a group and how bonding together can really do damage to the antagonist. They just happen to go and kick Pennywise's ass without really understanding their importance, their transition. Anyone can say 'I'm not scared of you' and that's that -- but make me FEEL it first! The 'loser' aspect of 'The Loser's Club' was a total miss. They all seemed a little too cool to be losers and outcasts. So what if they get bullied? Everyone does, but there is no big sense of being total castaways. Henry and the Bowers gang needed more screen time to really establish themselves as true sadistic antagonists -- pushing kids around just doesn't do that. Skarsgard did a remarkable job as Pennywise and because of that they, the Muschietti's, should have let him do what he does best -- instead the 'filmmakers' attempted to add an extra layer to his performance with CGI, which was dreadful, comical, and extremely damaging to the character.Unfortunately the R-Rating wasn't because of the horror/gore of the film, which really wasn't that special and all that much, but rather the language (f*cks, dick, mama jokes) ultimately contributed in the MPAA decision in giving it an R -- disappointing. The pacing of the story wasn't executed well -- it's all 'scare'-after-'scare' without any time to absorb its effect on the characters and the story. Each scene just goes one to the other without having any emotional impact. All and all -- it could have been darker, taken a little more seriously, and gotten a lot further into the psychological state (which Tim Curry did brilliantly). Cancel any upcoming contracts that both Barbara and Andy Muschietti have lined up because we're going to witness a lot more wasted screen time and upcoming BS from these two unworthy amateurs.",7,1,2,22 October 2017
