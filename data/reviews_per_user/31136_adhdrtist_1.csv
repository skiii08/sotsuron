Child 44," Tom Hardy
","Having watched all of Tom Hardy's film to date, I am so impressed that I am doing something I have never done....write a review. He is the most versatile and talented actor I have watched since Robert Deniro. Fresh from playing Mad Max and earning a first Oscar nomination for going up against Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant, Tom Hardy has reportedlysigned on to embody famed British war photographer Don McCullin. Tom Hardy is set to star in a new film about Ernest Shackleton, the polar explorer famous for his remarkable escape from the Antarctic continent with all his crew despite losing his ship when it was crushed by ice. He is noteworthy because of his unforgettable performance's in each of his films.",Null,0,4,25 October 2016
