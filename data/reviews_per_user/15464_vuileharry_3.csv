Hereditary," Overhyped for Pretentiousness
","If you just look at the story it's just a story. Some people are trying to help their favorite demon to ressurect into a useable host and in the end they succeed.That's it. It's actually a really simple given and it's just fine for 'horror'. And of course there's a million ways to go about telling it.Now how would you go about tricking people into thinking your movie is really 'highbrow' and 'special'?Just make your movie needlessly long with lots of boring long-ass shots and above all needlessly 'mysterious', by giving out the information in an almost ungraspable way, so you just have to watch it 3 times or go read on internet before you can understand this basicly pretty simple story. That's how.Thats really all that makes this movie seem so genious to some: they make a puzzle out of it. But if you strip the story down to it's bare bones (after you finally got it of course), there is absolutely nothing so special about it. It's just a pretty average, standard story, only told like a complicated puzzle. That's all.There's more movies like this that get overhyped by some for this very same reason. Well, not for me. I really don't think this movie is so brilliant. Or scary.
Now I cannot at all say this movie is bad. Because it really isn't. Hence my rating of 4 stars. It's just long and boring.",4,6,12,24 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Whiney Star Wars 'Fans'
","Geeez, whats wrong with all the neverending whining 'Star Wars Fans' huh?
Rating this movie 4 or even as low as 1? Seriously? So to you this movie is worse then for instance Battlefield Earth or Baby Geniuses or Exorcist II?You've got to be kidding me... Are you all 5 years old or just severely mentally unstable?I don't know, whatever... Just know all the dislikes this review will most certainly get come from those insane babies, don't pay attention to them and don't listen to them, they are just parrots with no mind of their own (or just completely lacking one at all).Believe me, better movies of course do exist but this movie makes for a very enjoyable watch!",7,6,22,11 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Don't read reviews
","Sometimes if you want the most chance to get a decent idea of a movies quality, please just look at the overal score on the movies page. That's where all normal people who seen the movie give it an honest number based on howmuch they liked it.But when you start reading reviews, you will get the 'highly opinionated' folks that feel so strong they need to write something and among who, as logic demands, there's a lot of haters & complainers and people who get their opinions from other people's opinions. Kind of like youtube.About the movie I will be short: the number at the movies page is correct. All these reviewers here giving this movie a 1 star? So you say this movie is worse than Battlefield Earth and Exorcist VII? How can you expect anyone to take you serious then? You must be either completely insane, highly childish or just parrot-talking a silly but popular youtube opinion.Take it from me this movie is actually a really nice way to pass 2 hours.",8,1,20,21 May 2018
