The Avengers," Nice onset where Avengers assemble!
","Tone, Script & Story: Loki gets control of Tisseract. He wants to bring Doom of humanity by opening a portal to chitauri army with the help of Tisseract. Superheroes must now assemble to fight this threat against planet earth.It is the first movie where the Avengers assemble, thus being one of the reasons why it appeals. The storyline here is not complicated and easy to swallow. If you see Marvel Universe movies in order - it would be nice. Even if not watching all of them, watching a few, do it in order.My favorite scene is where Hulk beats Loki and refers to him as puny God. It never gets old.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified. Music: Justified. Acting: Justified.Final Verdict: It is a nice onset where Avengers assemble! Watch it in order to appoint disappointment.",8,1,2,9 September 2018
First Man," A small step for man, giant leap for mankind!
","Since our childhood, the solar system portrayed has its objects in a way that is 'not to scale'. Well because of that it becomes easy for someone to project moon nearer and think if flights can cover the type of distance on earth moon is not far away. Well this is where the accuracy of 'to scale' matters. Guess what the distance between Earth and the moon is. The answer is 30 times the diameter of Earth. Now just imagine the 'to scale' picture of other bodies. With such nature the foremost option that occurs to mind to carry out lunar mission is carry fuel. Taking into mind this option and overcoming the risks, first landing on moon was carried out. The movie gives account of that.In future however it would be nice to see achieving such feats with solar or nuclear fuel. Once we dint have airplanes to travel. The way they are used today I can say, future is waiting for us.",7,0,1,14 December 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A decent entertaining installment.
","Like its other installments, the elements of franchisee 'Pirates of the caribbean' have been handled well. The fantasy factor (in story), black magic, relationships, anti-pirates, pirates (mostly Jack), crew, etcetera are amazing like always. The visuals are worth mentioning as well.In this installment characters are after fountain of youth, which would grant them additional life.(Like most of the audience) for me all's well that ends well. A movie with such theme appeals to bigger audience. The end however in this movie seems abrupt but makes up to it with 'Jack's dialogue 'The Fountain does test you'.The character of Jack portrays a witty, selfish person but righteous as a hidden quality. It wins heart of the audience in general. It's worth to solely mention that.Final Verdict: It is a decent entertaining installment.",8,0,0,21 January 2019
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Incredibly Humorous - challenging ideals, thankfully fiction!
","The movie however it has come out made me think it's real. I mean not all but Borat as channel representative, his producer, the incident of national anthem and last but not the least Pamela Anderson incident. It took me to google out for real anthem and profile of real actors along with frequently asked questions on imdb followed by number of votes to find out that this 1hr20min treat is 100% work of fiction. Yes I would have fallen for a culture with such values, even if it put me on my toes. Thankfully it is total fiction and impeccable treat of humor.Tone, Script & Story: The story how two people from a channel in Kazakhstan interview Americans for their uplift of their society.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: I fell for this work of fiction as described earlier. It is that good. Acting: Borat nails it. Other actors are incredibly well too.Final Verdict: It is an Incredibly Humorous treat challenging some of society's norms, but no worries thankfully as its fiction!",8,0,0,27 July 2018

Captain Phillips," Another biopic, filmed well & quite entertaining.
","My expectations from this movie were average, but as the movie progressed it turned out much well. The reality clause and the turnout of events complemented each other.Tone, Script & Story: The movie mainly tells the story of Captain Richard Phillips on one of his journeys into the sea, where pirates attack. I would avoid any spoilers. The given information says everything shown in an introduced trailer.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: It did not have much to context with given plot, but whatever was shown was justified.

","Tone, Script & Story: Charlie is a fifteen year old boy. His best friend has committed suicide. He is also suffering from mental illness. He has newly took admission in High School. Being an introvert it's difficult but he manages to get friends and love.I liked the character of Patrick the most. It brings more soul to this drama, the fun elements are fantastic. I like the relationship that builds between Charlie and Sam despite all to's and fro's. The idea lying in the phrase 'We accept the love we think we deserve' makes one think.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Movie is adapted from the novel of Stephen Chbosky. He is also the director. It's once again proved the movies adopted from books are better if taken into average consideration.Music: For me music was good, if you belong to the audience listening to English music, I feel you would find it even better. Acting: Justified. Final Verdict: It is one of the high school affairs which it delighting. It keeps you entertained and going. It is worth adding to your collection.",9,3,5,4 September 2018

","Catch me if you can is a movie about a con man played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The story portrays how he is close to his father, also via incidents where his mother takes him out via bail in bits and parts.

The Hangover," Let's go to Vegas!
","The Hangover is absolute comedy treat for little over one hour forty minutes. Its how four friends decide to visit Las Vegas just before one of them gets married. I did not saw the trailer just decided to see it on the basis of IMDb rating, genre and introductory lines and guess what happened. I was surprised by this standard entertainment.

Minority Report," Concept of precogs allured me!
","When I first watched the movie, I loved the concept of precogs. Here in India there is a saying 'kuch paaney k liye kuch khona padta hai' which means 'To get something we have to lose something'. Following that saying and putting light to precogs it allured me. The pain of precogs did not occurr to me much, over the gains achieved in return.When I watched the movie the second time I better understood how the precogs came into existence and why keeping them in pain was wrong.Still I ask you would you nurture precogs to have a crime free world.

Argo," Overrated by critics!
","When I first saw the review, I made up my mind to not watch this movie. I however changed that thought when one of my friends who also is a fan of movies - praised it. I would say it to be overrated by critics. I mean three Oscars, it was showered with unnecessary praise. I don't hype about it much but I consider Oscars to be overrated. Despite that one would still find comfort in having one. The story is thin lined I mean it would be the truth but only one person is dispatched to take out six people out of Iran after all the planned mumbo-jumbo. If it's the truth it's okay, but on scale of entertainment it fall's.",7,1,1,25 July 2018

Now the special thing is this guy can travel in time or to be more specific the males in this family can travel in time.I liked the script as it was developed surrounding a beautiful love story followed by matters that include family.

I liked the whole story scenario with Margot Robbie as well.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Direction is good. Movie is better than 'love actually'. Both are delivered to us by director Richard Curtis. Both the movies are carved out beautifully.Final Verdict: It is a beautiful love story followed by charming terms with one's family.

","Tone, Script & Story: The story is about how ruler of water world 'Aquaman' comes into existence. A fate, a war (with land dwellers) is in his hands when he comes to power. The movie portrays an above average story.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The biggest strength of the movie is its visuals. The ones at the end are spectacular. The ones on land too are very good. For me the ones in ocean were crowdie and blurry. The same appeared when I saw finding Nemo. I guess that happened to portray a reality (in the sea) more precisely. I wished if they were clear even after being in Ocean. Despite that they were nice. This movie was first of its kind given to us by director James Wan. It was a nice job. Most of his earlier work circulated around horror genre.Music: Above average.

Deadpool 2," Not as great as Deadpool - part 1
","What made me to go and watch Deadpool 2 in multiplex. The answer is simple the first movie 'Deadpool'. I was looking for more. The adult humor and cinematography and execution of other factor's from previous movie had set my hopes high. Sadly I was left disappointed, part 2 was no match when compared to part 1 in all the mentioned areas.There are factors, which some time seem too much in given movies. In deadpool series it is the regrowth of limbs. I find that too much (new limb with no scar, it could perhaps heal thedisfiguration too). Despite that part 1 was a (better) treat. While watching the part 2, I felt that first 1hr 10mins could have been rounded up in 50 minutes. I felt dragged. I was dying to know the plot, I wanted to skip.Music: Music was good. Acting: Actors acted well in the scope that was given to them.Final Verdict: It is a comic treat for most of the audience. Not as great as Deadpool - part 1.",7,0,2,19 May 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Trailers these days have all the good present in the movie.
","To be really frank the three released trailers and their content had more good than the entire movie. The way things are going I mean a lot bunch of superhero movies coming into picture are framed in such a way, they would not appeal to me. They contain content appealing to general public as well as critique, but are not for people of my type. Speaking about this movie, amongst all the trailers and movie I liked the first trailer the most, it conveyed teen love and had beautiful music from song MGMT - Time to Pretend .Acting was above average, although at the place where I saw, lacked subtitles. I wished if those were there. The spiderman suit logic was good. It made sense of having such a suit which was not sewn but gifted (better logic as compared to previous movies).Music was average. To - many people, the music might be good, but to me, I come from a land rich in that area (music). And thus music in my view, in the movie was average. They did not include the music from trailer one that was another let down.From the crowd response, I feel that the movie was great for most of them so you would definitely like it.",7,2,5,7 July 2017
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Well earned Title - 'The flying Sikh'
","Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Condition after partition, rural scenes, sincere love, friendship, coach – athlete relationship, discipline, hard work of athlete, etcetera all have been pictured well. I would deduct half a mark because I think movie could have been shortened by 15 minutes or so in second half (3.5/5).Tone: The movie depicts story of a Sikh who after partition moves to India. He grows rogue (because of what he witnesses) until the woman he loves addresses him to become a respected person. This makes him to join army where he finds his athletic skills. The later part is how he keeps on winning and bringing pride to India. At the end, Pakistan gives him the title 'The flying Sikh' and movie ends (4/5).Music: Music is very good (4.5/5). It highly adds to charm of the movie.Acting: Acting is very good (4/5).Final Verdict: It is worth adding to your DVD collection [(4/5) (9/10)].",9,0,0,25 September 2017
The Book Thief," The innocence drives you but ends awfully.
","I would like to ask you a question. Do you read books? Do you love reading them? Are you always enthusiastic in completing a current one and starting a new one? Well that you will relate to this movie more than anybody and let your enthusiasm going. Rather than into books, I am enthusiastic about videos, movies - I mean things graphic in nature with audio and video. I would have said 'I understand what I feel for motion pictures same you feel for books' but no more than that this one has got its own charming element.The innocence of a child with associated factors (like friends); new parents, holocaust situation, rebelling secretly, saving someone by hiding him build this movie.Tone, Script & Story: See IMDB Storyline. Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The sets built as if portraying World War 2, place of residence accompanying other factors are very good.Final Verdict: It's not a happy ending; it is something filmed, putting light on what can happen during war. The innocence drives you but ends terribly.",8,0,0,27 August 2018
Life of Pi," Visually stunning but story is little difficult to swallow!
","Tone, Script & Story: A family in India is an owner of zoo. The family has decided to relocate. They have decided to sell their animals in a foreign country as they are getting a better price there. To relocate they choose sea to travel. Pi is one of the members in the family. The movie highlights why he got that name. Further it is described how while travelling an accident occurs and pi is stranded on a boat along with a tiger, zebra and a hyena. Later in a story only pi and tiger are left. They survive. It is the story mostly on what happened on that boat.I myself being an Indian find sense of satisfaction when movie 'Life of pi' is concerned. The movie has won four Oscars. The area where I find it most justified is Cinematography and visual effects. As far as the story is concerned I can't go along with it. I mean a tiger leaving it's pray. It is further described they waited on an island which turned acidic. I ask how the trees and animals there survived. It's not easy to swallow.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Winning Oscar's in cinematography and visual effects has restored my faith in Oscars to some extent. Music: It's traditional, I can't judge as I am not an Expert. Acting: Justified.Final Verdict: The movie is visually stunning but story is little difficult to swallow!

Chak de! India," B4 player comes the team & b4 team comes the country!
","After watching Soorma, some critics compared it as weak version in sports genre when compared with movies like Chak de! Chak de is a very nicely scripted film when we take sportsman ship into consideration except for the scene which declares our coach as anti-national. It's sad that this scene becomes the core for what this movie stands. Other than that, what coach has in mind for team highlights true sportsmanship? Playing for the country rather than self or local team matters more. The movie is entertaining, introduction of players, their backgrounds, their role and mutual interaction amongst them is a treat to watch.Tone, Script & Story: The story is how a failed player finds redemption as he turns out coach, learns from his mistakes and guides Indian women hockey team towards success. Direction, Screenplay and Cinematography: Justified. Music: Good. Acting: Justified.Final Verdict: The idea that carries the movie 'Before the player comes his team and before his team comes his country' is appealing. The movie is worth watching.",8,1,1,29 July 2018
Interstellar," (Hats Off) x 5, where 5 belongs to 5 dimensions!
","We have grown up in the age of sci-fi where films like Jurassic park and Godzilla (the previous one) gave us the idea of ongoing growth in Science. Myself being a great fan of such a genre, it added to my pleasure. Now when a decade or two has been passed, it is great to have a movie belonging to the same genre coming from world's greatest director Christopher Nolan.
Christopher is famous for movies like Inception and The Dark Night trilogy as well. Interstellar picks up even in the areas where Inception and The Dark Night trilogy could not. The thriller in inception takes away the touch of reality, also visuals in my opinion were not up to mark (I mostly find it that way if they are built by special effects). On the other hand The Dark Night trilogy belonged to superhero genre, thus it stays away from comparison.
I find no shame in admitting that it took me two times to watch the movie to understand it completely. Also this is my second review after deleting first one. Now all I can say it to be as (Hats Off) x 5, where 5 belongs to 5 dimensions. The story is built by interaction of various interstellar elements like dimensions, black hole, its horizon, relativity, gravity, space, time, worm hole, various worlds, emotions and love. The story is how 'they' from future, interact with present human (probably 'they' from past) to save humanity.
Final verdict: A classic, as it would go down in history.",10,1,1,12 February 2018
Lion," Entertainment and subject devotion both stay true.
","The movie directs us towards the good people and people involved in various institutions do to create better life for people who are in need.Lion aka saroo aka sheru is the boy who gets lost during child hood. The story is how he spends more than 25 years away until google maps help him find his family back. The movie made me weep at 3 instances and trust me that is not easy to happen. I felt awesome.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The movie is crafted well; various places like the place where rocks are picked, place where trains leave and arrive, beaches in Australia, the institution where lost children are bought in, etc along with dialog delivery are framed well.Tone: Bringing up a lost child and he finally finding his original family after growing up is the tone in which lion is set. To find someone with name Sheru give the movie an entertainment advantage.Music: Music is above average.Acting: Acting was great.Highly recommended.rating: 8.5/10.",9,0,2,5 March 2017

Gone Baby Gone," only if the ending were different!
","Gone baby gone is a movie about lost baby. The mother of baby is an addict. The movie rotates around what is done to find out where the baby is. Media comes into picture. Special detectives are hired and the search is carried out. It comes to the picture that, a person from official authority has the baby. The person was now on verge of retirement. The person's family contains only him and his wife and there are no children. Till the movie ends, he is retired and is even caught as a result he goes to jail. I liked the movie so much that how a family does the thing that is termed as crime. They choose a baby, which has the maximum possibility to end up with a bad future and then the person goes ahead with the plan. I did not like the ending. The child needed to be with better parents, but still a movie with message and counter message challenging ethics, thus from my side, lower rating only for such an ending. A film recommended fairly.Rating: 7.5/10",7,0,1,6 October 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," A nice beginning in creation of the first Avenger!
","It is nice to witness mostly how a super hero comes-brought into existence. The same is a case here, you will love the kind of the said superhero is previously is and his changed avatar for what only he could be.Tone, Script & Story: The story is set in Hitler's time when a lot of experiments were conducted to demonstrate superiority. A superhuman (captain America) is created to fight evil program Hydra. The movie allured me until the time our superhero came into existence. I am not a great fan of the fight that occurred.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified. Music: Justified. Acting: Justified.Final Verdict: I liked captain America for what he is and was a superhuman with same intrinsic properties. A nice story that describes how first superhero among Avengers emerges.",8,1,2,13 October 2018
Nightcrawler," Won't let u do a thing, that I won't do myself.
","As the story moves towards end, one might think that Jake Gyllenhaal is doing something equivalent to a crime. Even I thought the same, until he employs new people and addresses them, 'I would not tell you to do anything that I won't do myself'. Carefully thinking further I found him to be true, thus the story does not end on a negative note.What else I liked about the story? Jake is a nerd who learns everything from the internet. He might have been successful in other fields but he chooses journalism. His nature to learn and deploy are amongst the things that attract.",8,0,0,1 June 2017
Armageddon," Imparts knowledge as an additional treat!
","Tone, Script & Story: I like the movies which teach us something. The movies which give us something to think about. In short increasing our knowledge base, putting something in our think tank. Armageddon is sci-fi. It portrays a phenomenon that can occur in future. A phenomenon that might have been the reason humans exist and dinosaurs don't, on planet earth.The story puts light how a group of miners dig through an asteriod and avoid it from crashing into earth. It does not end here, in the process of portraying a film that saves us from another mass extinction it puts light on human values like love, emotions, sacrifice, heroism and the list goes on. Thus it has got all factors required for a good movie.Final Verdict: It has got something to impart knowledge into your think tank. It is worth adding to your collection.",9,2,3,31 May 2018

He finally won an Oscar for this movie (the revenant) in 2015.Final Verdict: For me it is worth adding to my collection. For most of them out there you can decide for yourself from the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio finally won an Oscar for it.",8,1,2,29 October 2018
Hugo," Movie about movies - A Family Entertainer.
","The very first question that arises in my mind after watching to movie was if the movie was documented or inspired biography. The answer is no it is adopted from a book meant mainly for children.The movie is about movies, in the run it asks for a great cinematographic experience, and in my opinion it is highly fulfilled. The Cinematography of Paris in 1930's portrayed, is excellent.The movie is something parents can watch with their children and have a great experience together.Final Verdict: I was expecting a biographic experience, nevertheless its okay. IMDb rating stands justified. It is worth adding to your collection.",8,0,0,7 January 2019

They will like it.,7,0,3,21 February 2019
Wanted," Matchless movie on assassins!
","Wanted is a movie about a group of assassins who kill after certain process, reveal the name of the target.Assassin's here take under their wing, an individual who suffers from anxiety. It is so as if the individual is son of former super assassin and has the same qualities which just need to be polished.The super human abilities appear to be fantastic. What I liked is that if a human being is able to cross the limits of his or her body than physics won't be the problem. Physics would support such assassins.All the action in finding out the truth about father, truth about the process revealing names of target, ditching boss, leaving cheating girlfriend making new colleagues as friends and further killing them, its all carved out beautifully.",10,2,5,24 May 2017
Warrior," A deep emotional treat, belonging to genre - family drama and sports.
","Generally people will assume 'Warrior' to be a sports movie before watching it. I would like to enlighten you that this movie is much more. It contains a family where a Father is trying to be again part of lives of his sons. Another father trying to fight through his daily battles, who has to save his daughter from some medical complication. It also shows the relationship issue, among the brothers rising because they have grown apart. Overall, the story runs intense and deep.The fight sequences appear realistic. It can be seen how despite of having less muscle strength, a contender - one of the brothers, actually wins major rounds by technical tapouts.

The Machinist," Deep, ride of guilt of a person & how it is overcame?
","The story runs to and fro with intense visuals and drama moving around a guy acted by Christian Bale. He appears weak, describing how he has not slept for a while. His consciousness turns into vain. It starts to deceive him. Upon acting as the situation comes, it is seen that our main character gets to know how to get out of his misery a step at a time. Finally he is at peace.Actor Christian Bale's body transformation amongst various movies can be seen, it keeps circulating internet. The movie Machinist is another example of his fine work.Final Verdict: The movie is a work where guilt rides main character about something he did. He is at peace when he stop's running from his fate and accept what is justice.",8,0,1,26 July 2018

Ratatouille," Best Pixar movie!
","When it comes to animated movies, the movies I like most are the ones which appeal to children as well as adults equally. This is second movie I have liked from director Brad Bird besides The incredibles. It is better than the incredibles. I like the story, a rat controlling a human and the critic's take in the given movie.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: A rat losing his family along the sewers, becoming a chef, impressing a critic for what he is, also how Paris is projected from certain height, etcetera, everything has been captured well.Tone: Number one chef in Paris states that anyone can cook which really meant a person having the respected job can come from any part of society. Here the rat comes in as chef and even becomes most successful of them all. It is captured well.Music: Music is average.Final verdict: It is worth saving in your DVD collection.",9,0,0,14 September 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Science could have flashed better.
","There have been five movies that have come into play since year 2000. They were in the year 2002 2004 2007 2012 and 2014.The best movie according to me was in 2007 (spider man 3) and the not so good was in year 2012 (The amazing spider man). What I most disliked about the movie released in 2012 was the process how spider man comes into existence, it was unrealistic. However it was good in portraying actions of spider man, which were not so good in previous movies.What would have been ideal process of spider man coming into existence? It could have been scripted better. For me it would have been a bite of spider followed by some sort of laser rays falling on subject.Any process that guarantees easy build up for super humans would result in their large number. Thus portraying such a process is wrong.Thus my ratings: Spider-Man (2002): 8/10, Spider-Man 2 (2004): 8/10, Spider-Man 3 (2007): 9/10, The Amazing Spider-Man (2012): 7/10, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014): 8/10",7,1,3,7 April 2017
Now You See Me," Ideally knowledge should be given to access by all.
","As you all know I share ratings with following sequence: rating = number of stars, 6=1(poor), 7=2(average), 8=3(good), 9=4(very good), & 10=5(excellent). Now I will tell you why I have been rated this as poor.The example of type of knowledge is 'how to execute certain magic'. In the whole world everybody should be given access to such knowledge. Only such a world would be ideal. Here in this movie this idea is contradicted. The knowledge is shared only among selected ones. Morgan Freeman tries to make it ideal, but ends behind prison.When sequel was announced I thought justice would be done but the story that is woven even in the sequels is something else jumbled up. Hence even the sequel is rated as poor.",7,0,0,13 October 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best X-Men Movie yet!
","The story is to contact Mutants in past to stop a project that vanishes mutants in present, thus the name days of future past.I have to congratulate Marvel to effectively construct the stories with the given comic elements nowadays. Some of them are a real gem. The current installment of X-Men is of that kind.I liked the Logic involving Time Travel. Logic for why to consider Logan as a contender to time travel is worth mentioning too. But what I liked the most was Quick Silver and his part.There are certain scenes which audience generally likes like the one with the rail tracks, scene involving sentinels, and stadium. It comes with bigger budget. Well I am neutral about them.Final Verdict: For me it is the best X-Men movie yet!",8,0,0,2 February 2019
Captain America: Civil War," Seemed as if minds of superheroes were toggled.
","It's strange how we were introduced to the characters of Iron man and captain America in earlier versions of Avenger movies. It never seemed like Iron man could go for the version which accepts rules to fight by getting in accordance with UN. Furthermore, it would be Captain America to oppose such a bond laid down by UN. Well this was something my mind could not accept in some way so I rated it less. Well if that is something that does not come to your mind you will definitely find movie to be great.I don't know why the movies with single superheroes pleases me more than multiples ones. If you are a marvel fan you would definitely like this so go for it.",8,1,2,20 June 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," one of the most beautiful movie till date
","The movie was released on November 18 in India and somehow I missed, but luckily there were few shows available 20 days later. It came to my senses that the movie is terrific and friends I am glad to say that I was not disappointed.Direction and Cinematography: Once again I got to notice why using traces of gold in creating beasts make them more beautiful. Description penned down by J.K. Rowling was mind blowing in every aspect. Half work done direction came out as blooming of some beautiful flower. There are super hit movies like avatar and there are other movies like Journey to the mysterious island, but this one I find most beautiful when compared.Tone: We are set to see tone of Hogwarts, but my friends this movie is different. There's how politics work, there's beauty, there's love and all that adds to the tone. It's terrific.Music: There has been music in harry potter previous movies. No wonder Double trouble was one of my favorites'. This movie has got less of that, but it beautifully goes with the tone.Acting: I don't know how they do it but acting is terrific, the selection, the makeup everything adds to it. May it be Newt, may it be Tina, may it be her sister, may it be obscurius producing boy, may it be the man misguiding this boy, may it be the man who wants to start bakery. All were terrific.",9,4,8,6 December 2016
Inside Out," Great ride through emotions!
","Inside out is movie about emotions. Various emotions depicted in the movie are joy, fear, disgust, anger and sadness. The movie is about a girl who grows up to 11 years of age and then faces, what we can say, her first major mental breakdown resulting in a sad core memory formation. This happens because of the reason they move from Minnesota to a new place. The dull phase of her life is gradually overcome as the movie progresses as she learns to handle emotions more nicely.A human brain consists of various parts. It's fair to say that activity in certain part is responsible for a specific emotion. The movie has portrayed it very nicely. Human brain is very complicated structure. How it works majorly remains a mystery. The work done in the movie is a great representation of available information. The movie shows how a human being matures in terms of his emotions. Its shown how the girl learns to handle multiple emotions in terms of memory.My personal favorite emotions(characters) go in order anger, fear, joy, disgust, and sadness. Anger being the most liked one. The movie is wonderful, great job done by creators. Fairly recommended.",8,33,74,29 September 2015
Avengers: Endgame," An after research ruined my experience, more than a little.
","It's one of the movies that involves for the first time 'time travel' by making changes in past by altering quantum realm. The science even if correct has its set back. The time traveler is not automatically aware of things as they occurred (the changes).For me the movie scores negative after infinity war, but it did not happen while viewing. It happened after researching the fate of Iron man and vision. Until that time it was epic for me, as I thought the fate of Universe can be altered but not changed and from what Iron man did it killed whole bunch of other people. All these combined with (to add further) fate of Captain America and Black Widow made my experience unique. After research it was that iron man ended the lives of only Thanos and his army, degrading the movie experience.The story tricks you into remembering events of past, this is where it creates an epic experience for a fan audience. As far as I am considered, I feel it to be a shortcut. Ahhh... I am kidding even I liked it.Final Verdict: It's a joy ride for fan Audience.",8,1,5,27 April 2019
District 9," You cannot afford to miss this if you are a sci-fi fan!
","Tone, Script & Story: The aliens have inhabited an area on Earth creating slums. The area is known as district 9. Humans have appointed a team which would help them shift Aliens to new area district 10. The story also highlight's an officer which has turned alien, after getting exposed to their technology. Will he turn human again? What will it take? The above two questions along with the love life of alien turned human set a bar in entertainment that's not easy to break.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: I usually don't go praising CGI maybe because I don't find worth it, but here in this movie I praise it, it was good.Final Verdict: In the run, we get on a roller coaster that's full of entertainment. You cannot afford to miss this if you are a sci-fi fan!",8,0,1,19 July 2018
The Fault in Our Stars," Oblivion is inevitable - still I want my name to go long in history!
","Tone, Script & Story: I have watched the movie twice. The first time was a long time ago. I will discuss what I remembered from first time – first. It was as if how two in-completes meet each other to build something which is complete. What else I remembered from story did not show exactly same the second time. It was as if Hazel while attending the funeral explained how happy go lucky stud Gus, fell in despair in his last days (I mean even the strong ones deteriorate). While watching second time, there's nothing like this. Instead what is shown apart from coming together is that they visit Amsterdam to her favorite writer and spent some good time. In short the funeral scene were as if got replaced.Apart from the story mentioned above what I most liked is how Gus wants him to be remembered in world and how Hazel mentions truly loved by someone,even if the only person, is more than enough as oblivion is inevitable. I stand with Gus on this one (4/5).Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Each of direction, screenplay and cinematography is very good. (4/5).Music: Music is very good as well (4/5).Acting: Acting is very good as well (4/5).Final Verdict: It is worth adding to your DVD collection [(4/5) (9/10)].",9,0,1,10 October 2017
How to Train Your Dragon 2," The true alpha – Night fury.
","What I most liked about the movie is how toothless gets over control of alpha and establishes his own self as alpha. Hiccup does not give up on his dragon despite his father's death. At last everything ends on good note.It is worth watching for adults as well as children.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: It is excellent.Tone: The tone relies on story where it is learnt how dragons can be controlled, mainly how alpha controls them and how can one achieve control over them for good or for bad. It is constructed well.Music: Music is average.It is worth watching multiple times.",8,0,0,11 September 2017
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Finally, Caesar is home!
","Tone: A researcher whose work is based on coming up with meds useful in treating Alzheimer's, brings home a chimp who is inhabited with same medicine from his mother (while being pregnant). The mother however dies, why I won't spoil that. When the same chimp (Caesar) ends up in restricted place, he brings up the uprising freeing all apes. The sci-fi genre the story emits is of tremendous class. I like the take when Caesar pulls Franco close and speaks out 'Caesar is home' (4/5). Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Computer generated graphics in construction of apes, city built scenarios, bridge, jungle, play space, how Caesar trains other monkeys, how wise he stands in the process, etcetera have been constructed well (4/5).Music: Music is good (3.5/5).Acting: Acting is good (3.5/5).Final Verdict: It is worth adding to your DVD collection [(4/5) (9/10)].",9,1,3,27 September 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Well justified with unpredictable plot, keeping you on your toes!
","Lately I have lost my interest in superhero stuff. It is so much that I would not spend my well earned bucks on them. However this experience was different. I went to see the movie with the number of positive reviews coming up. I however dint saw any trailers but came to knew few spoilers. I am happy that still it went positively for me.Tone, Script & Story: The story runs around Thanos who maintains balance of universe and kills in the process - going against Avengers (superheroes of Marvel universe). It was nice to see story constructed around Doctor Strange with his powers and now further development. It would be nice to see what magical world of Dr. Strange will mean to Tony(the man with knowledge) in coming sequel . I was however disappointed in construction of story around Bruce, he is no more winning and now he even can't get his other side out which is totally opposite to what we saw in last movie. To add further, the humor that goes on during various scenes in all such movies is a treat in itself. The end that we see in this movie, I don't know if it make sense to comic readers. For me it is a brain work that I think will get enlightened in the sequel.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Special effects come with a disadvantage in cinematography. For me contrast was not up to the mark. The constructed characters and scenes were however best in that genre.Final Verdict: Well justified with unpredictable plot, keeping you on your toes. Worth your penny.",8,1,7,28 April 2018
Django Unchained," IMDb numbers stand quite justified.
","Tone, Script & Story: A Bounty Hunter from Germany finds his new companion in a black guy named Django. They together set out over a journey to set free Django's wife. There is a lot of bloodshed lot of people killed but with the end pictured you walk out feeling positive.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: It's a movie directed by Quentin Tarantino. What's the trade mark? It would be violent with lots of blood involved. What's the positive we can take; well it shows us how certain things would take place for example in real world, like a shootout. For me Oscars are overrated. Despite that it won't hurt to have one and Quentin here has two (one of them for Best Writing, Original Screenplay for this movie Django Unchained). This is one of the movies with a vote bank of more than a million on IMDb, so that really means something.Music: Dint quite understood it like in most of the foreign movies but seemed as if it went well. Acting: Went well with direction.Final Verdict: IMDb numbers generally don't lie for major part of Audience. For me with respect to Django Unchained they stand quite justified.",9,1,4,1 September 2018
The Theory of Everything," It's no rocket science, its love story & story that inspires!
","The movie more than achievements of Stephen hawking is about his personnel life. How he got into wheel chair, his love life and his children. His first wife was a woman who had Faith. Hawking on the other hand was an Athiest. It takes faith and commitment to last this long. I mean till the time their marriage lasted.Hawking was a great person as well. When life threw a bouncer at him in 1963 (diagnosed with degenerative nerve disorder ALS) when he was 21 years old he fought with it. Doctors gave him a few months but he fought till his death in 1918 when he was 76 years old. He inspires a lot of us via that.He wrote a few books and was said to be greatest scientist of his - our time. He had a great sense of humor too.Final Verdict: It is no rocket science; it is a love story & a story that inspires! Add it to your collection!",8,0,0,21 August 2018
X-Men: The Last Stand," An epic end to a trilogy!
","What is it that the third version (x-men - the last stand) possesses but not the previous two?In sci-fi movies it matters to me if as I say, what is more close to acceptable?The story line is weak in second installment and weaker in the first one. Above that the first part appears analogous and the second part even more unacceptable.Here's where the third part shines, here they have strong elements in story. It consists of a comparatively large number of mutants in action. Above all it's a more acceptable sci-fi!It's a decent way to end trilogy. As we all know after this installment a different era in x-men film making starts.",8,2,2,27 January 2019

","P.S. I love you is a story that takes place as a result of male member of married couple, Jerry and Holly, dies. As Jerry dies, he has pre-planned 10 messages to be delivered at right time to Holly.Critics have however not appreciated the movie.

Schindler's List," Schindler – The Messiah.
","Oskar Schindler, when someone judges him at first time may think of him as a moody business man who most important aim is money. His moody nature takes his contacts made, with higher authorities and women. Now this man does the work of saving 1,100 lives.From where I see, he has done a Godly act by saving lives. He sacrifices all of his earned wealth in rescuing Jews and still at end regrets the money he used as bribe for growth of his industry, could have saved more lives.At last I want to just say his moody nature is nothing, in front of lives he saved.",8,16,25,25 May 2017
A Quiet Place," Critics stand justified (original), but I craved for more!
","Tone, Script & Story: New species have come into existence in a post-apocalyptic world. They hunt their prey hearing and locating their pray. This is a story one such family who may fall to be the prey. Will they succeed in their quest to survival?What grabbed my attention was the metascore and the runtime of the movie. It became priority to watch the movie. After watching I got to know why this movie was praised by critics so much. SPOILER well the answer is humans evolve to produce a sound that can keep this beast's away SPOILER. It did not entertain me on that grand scale.

The Game," The Game-Don't read this spoiler review until u watch the movie!
","Tone, Script & Story: When it comes to movies filled with thrill where suspense and mystery are the base to define the movie last scene is signature scene mostly to define the movie.There are movies like 'Kingsman- The Secret service' where subject when gets idea everything is planned make's the story weak. I mean it becomes predictable everything will be safe and this is where the movie loses its mark. This is where 'The Game' is different. David Fincher never lets you to get to the comfort zone that everything is safe and the end it becomes worth so much.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography, Music, Acting: Everything goes well with the tone.Final Verdict: It is worth adding to your DVD collection [(4/5) (9/10)].",8,1,2,11 October 2017
Unknown," Unpredictable-foremost reason for my entertainment.
","A person who has watched too many movies especially movies belonging to similar genre is capable to predict the plot which is supposed to be mysterious. This was not the case for me here. I liked that.A negative or selfish mind - can it change for good. The answer is it takes time. However there is one more way going through a kind of shock incident. 'courtesy twitter wtf facts: A man had certain disorder he shot himself and survived, the incident cured his disorder and he became straight A student'. So I guess script went well.The hidden world, the intelligence, the spy world are carved out in a likeable way. All of the entities a layer below (police, hotel staff, driver, etc) are quite appealing as well.The conclusion on which future of humanity thrives is worth looking for.",8,2,2,12 December 2018

","I have my peculiar favorites when it comes to movie series. The 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series lies among my favorites.After the first movie the graph improved and stayed better until the fourth movie. The fifth movie however is the one where I endured a little set back.The fantasy factor has allured me throughout the series. In the fifth movie however trident related with all the wizardry existing in the sea is broken. Does that mean fantasy factor will be lost? It is thus the reason why I disliked that part.Final Verdict: Being one of the series I follow, a good enough movie to add to ones collection.",7,0,0,10 January 2019
Sultan," She gave up her dream of Olympics - biggest disappointment.
","Well I generally write the reviews to express my, one to few opinions. It's sad that I would be required to write at least a few lines. Let's break them as pros and cons.Pros: A good movie as compared to those movies (most of them) in which salman khan has worked. Emotions were effective in reaching to public (not to me).Acting was good from entire cast.Cons: Inaccurate fights among salman khan and his opposition. The biggest disappointment was a women giving up her dream for not going for Olympics. This nature contradicted with the nature that she exposed of being herself in first part of movie (which could have been portrayed well).Movie still appear little unrealistic for which I don't have to address it as pro or con, as I don't mind.

X-Men: Apocalypse," Hyped title- It's all that
","To begin with I had very high hopes with X-men: Apocalypse. One can look at the name and just look at the enemy mutant in the trailers and get set in top most gear, but my friends I would like to put a stop at that.Yes this review contain spoilers, the story is simple a new mutant is introduced which is all powerful and oldest of them all. If it were just that would have been enough but this mutant is capable of enhancing power of other mutants. He team ups with others to wage war on defensive mutants and humans in general, which has to be fought and overcome. The idea of such a mutant was not welcomed in my thoughts.I liked introduction of new mutants. More with reference to control their powers in given circumstances could have been added.Quicksilver action sequence was great. I personally feel Cyclops could have been come up with controlling his energy naturally all by himself.Still the comparison comes with other x-men movies. For me the movie was average.",6,3,7,24 May 2016
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Fascinating story of man born old aging young as time passes!
","Watching it again second time, after a long time refreshed the memories and gave me clear idea of movie that was placed in my eyes.Direction: It's my most liked work laid down by David Fincher.Screenplay, Cinematography: Constructing the past time, other old stuff throughout time, till current date, in fact 2003 (in movie) is very easy on eyes. They provide a pleasant experience. Five out of five star for that.Tone: The movie revolves around a man who ages young after being born old. The character played by Brad Pitt is carved very well and the looks from old age to young one gives out ideal make up.Music: Music is average. There is piano, opera singer and others carved well.Acting: If one has to go through training for ballet dancing that surely is tough. Hats off if it was done without special effects. I mostly liked the acting of mother who raised him, Followed by ship's captain.",9,0,2,18 March 2017
Hidden Figures," Bringing equal rights and eliminating racial differentiation.
",When you belong to a colored category or being someone from lower category and a film gives you a story where the society lifts you up. All you feel is cheers to that.A person who governs the position at top of certain institution has responsibility to guide the person with certain talent at their specific position. The way the talented ones were treated especially Catherine makes me sad. The good thing is although in spite of such treatment things change for better and the movie ends on positive note.,9,1,7,9 April 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Visually stunning roller coaster ride with all its elements!
","Tone, Script & Story: Our star lord has acquired an orb. Now villain Ronan will hunt him down for that orb with the help of which he can cause destruction in universe. Will Star Lord's 'Guardians of the galaxy' be able to stop Ronan. Things I liked: I liked Yondu with his weapon. I further liked the scene that contains Yondu and orb before approaching end. At last I also liked how Guardians of galaxy restore power of orb and the reason why they are successful.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: To be really frank movies that are a result of adoption to comic book has its own advantages and disadvantages. For me the disadvantage is the action that causes destruction in the movie. Despite that this movie excels in cinematography. It is visually stunning with all its elements. The visual treat is on par with movies like Avatar. The makeover of characters (like groot, gamora, drax, yondu, rocket), the places like nova corp, with all of its components are simply magnificent.Music: There is music which is played by star lord. It was given to him by his mother. It was good, although it dint attract me much. Acting: Everybody associated has acted really well.Final Verdict: If you have not read comic's, the movie brings a lot of freshness with it. This visually stunning roller coaster ride is worth watching.",8,1,2,16 August 2018
The Imitation Game," Alan Turing – Inventor of computers!
",I generally like the nerd nature. In this movie character played by Benedict Cumberbatch (Alan Turing) attracts you very much. The movie has a peculiar quality to keep you engaged till last. His bold nature in not caring much for anybody also attracts you. The movie than shows you about how Alan learns to behave with his other counter parts while gradually cracking the Enigma code.It's sad that the inventor of turing machines (computers) gradually commits suicide for he was being treated (medically) wrong.Highly Recommended.,9,1,3,26 May 2017
Uri: The Surgical Strike," An even more mature account of what I expected.
","When I first heard of the movie, I had in mind how US tackles it enemies. It uses satellites, drones, high tech weapons and to my surprise even avenging incident in URI all these factors came into play.If one has to be fidayeen he can take many, he just needs to find the crowd. To bring back every soldier alive is totally a different story.I don't know with how much accuracy the movie is portrayed, but in its run it depicts a really mature content. I came across factors like four teams, choppers (to be bought in use) and intelligence which seem inspired.The scene depicting an Indian intern capable of designing a drone (garud) on the other hand an enemy teen unable to even recognize it appeared peculiar.Final Verdict: It is the best war movie made in India until now. It is worth watching.",8,2,4,11 March 2019
Silence," Amen!
","I am a hindu by birth. Few years ago if someone would have told me to step on my God I would have denied it, I would have even got killed without minding much. But today I am different. I feel God would never want such a thing happening to its followers. Thus stamping or giving bad words for me today won't be big deal. Our God would never want anything ill happening to us. It's just that we should not make a fuss about it.Few years ago I turned towards atheism and was attracted towards Buddhism and was sad to have lost all my faith. You see faith is a positive thing which hurts if lost. Today I believe I have got back some of the lost faith. I pray so that my colleagues know I am not any different from them, I can absorb their feelings. Also I don't differentiate between religions and don't mind praying to all of them. As my Dad says they all lead to the same goal just path is different.",8,1,1,9 May 2017
Logan," Selling the name Logan – that was good!
","As the name suggests the movie is mostly about mutants like Logan. There's logan, his clone and his daughter. I am sorry if I miss something important in review. It would have been better if I would have watched it in Hindi, so be sure to take a note of that, see it in language you are most comfortable in.Direction, Screenplay, story: There is a lot of action involved story does justice to the chosen title. I was not happy with that decision. 'I wished if I could have seen more of action from other mutants'. I enjoyed the part where other mutants come into existence. Even though little, that was great.Cinematography: The movie is A(R in US) rated. A lot of blood was involved. Wounds penetrating deep in body were seen.Tone: Taking child mutant to a place where said fellow mutants are already present is the tone in which movie is set. I would say that, it is crafted well.Music: Music is below average.Acting: I personally liked the daughter mutant. Actions from her side were exceptional. Others were good too.",8,0,4,3 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," with that budget, could have been much better.
","The movie is about creating a machine named ultron, which can take the place of avengers in the long run. The idea is nurtured basically by Tony Stark and supported by Bruce Banner. The machine ultron, defies its purpose but in the process a character 'vision' is bought into existence.pros: we get to see ample lot of new avengers, love between 2 soldiers(black widow n Bruce), team-work, family love of a committed soldier(Hawkeye), positive ending.cons: an avenger is killed(sadly the one with lot of potential). unnecessary fight between Hulk n Iron-man(Jarvis is killed, internet is taken over.. yet stark has full access to his suit.. a special one.. which altogether demonstrates f**k*d logic, as he says in first movie We have hulk), man capable of building Jarvis requires a stone to build something they are not clear about, and it requires two of them to build something that has 'faulty' vision's.I personally felt the part where Thor connects with his thingy to have been more exposed, crashing buildings, entire city getting displaced in air all defining unnecessary, unpleasant visuals is shown.",7,1,7,24 April 2015
Blood Diamond," It's a real story now.
","Tone & Story: The title 'It's a real story now' is a sentence that find its source in the statement released by Danny Archer to Maddy Bowen (a journalist) while Danny was about to die. He does it so that the story portrayed by Bowen to entire world, generates its height. Danny before was a selfish character who dint mind the lives of innocent people to gain wealth, but later he loses his life to save an African man and bring his family together. The story puts light on how anything valuable produced (diamonds here, in this movie) in lands of Africa becomes curse for its own citizens. Later in movie it's shown how the 'story' (it's a real story now) influences 40 nations to sign 'The Kimberley Process' to check conflicting diamonds (5/5).Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Although the movie was not shot in Sierra Leone, Direction, Cinematography and Screenplay are very good (4/5).Music: Music is good. It goes well along with the tone (3/5).Acting: Acting is very good (4/5).Final Verdict: It is worth adding to your DVD collection [(4/5) (9/10)].",9,0,0,30 September 2017
Avatar," An Ethical Nature-alI Treat!
","Avatar is story about planet Pandora which is inhabited by intelligent aliens. These Aliens are more close to their mother Planet from anything else in a supernatural way. They are not advanced in terms of technology (yeah that's what we call on earth). Humans arrive on this planet to search of an element precious to them in terms of money. They have 'Avatar's' built which copy genome of these aliens. They look like aliens but have mind of a human. Avatar's are built to build relations with natural habitat on Pandora. One of the Avatar's gets too close to these aliens and joins them to protect their planet from arrived humans.Pros: Awesome natural visuals belonging to other planet. The seven words that u just read cover up for every con. Idea of overlapped connection.. i mean creating a altogether different creature in appearance(Avatar). Special bonding via Connection of typical organ. The connection bundles into tremendous energy when every being on planet kind of meditates in front of sacred tree. The scene in which they surround the sacred tree and meditate is tremendous. Finally Mother Nature defending itself literally rushes ones adrenalin high. The elements like sacred flower, respect to the prey and ceremony to say bye to deceased ones add to the natural element.Cons: Human race is shown too negative, if this were the case I doubt they could have survived elsewhere. The set up in which Avatar gets active should have bought up with more restrictions, I mean the entire body was made available for locomotion even in dream state and a connection terminated without caution would have resulting in death could have been a good idea. Aliens were thought to be not that intelligent (I mean while attacking they did not thought of flying. To add further 6th was human to figure out flight on that giant bird, OK I take back the later point.)",9,2,6,15 January 2016
Super 8," Mutual action between boy and Alien at the end makes it worth much more.
","It's not new that the formula of an alien trapped on earth is shown in movies. Well this movie is a little different so it gains additional points. Well in short it is a movie that shows trapped alien which escapes while it were being moved by respected authorities to some other location. A group of youngsters who are expert in film making somehow film the escaping alien. It is also known in later part of movie that the alien is responsible for people missing from the given village.The alien seems to take the extreme action of kidnapping people in the shade of fear. Also, it needs more than just the parts of spaceship to get away. This is where the movie shines. A boy from village understands this and helps the alien out. The boy has to let go of his most dear thing to help Alien escape peacefully. The thing that boy holds on to may be holding on to him in return. The mutual action that takes place between boy and Alien is simply beautiful.",8,1,3,7 June 2016
3 Idiots," Guides how education system should be!
","What can you learn from this movie? The answer is a lot! Have passion for something. Invest all your energy for that passion. Chase excellence in your given field of work, and success will follow. Have some die hard friends, who will always have your back. At last rustogi says me apni life k sath kuch na kuch to acha kar he lunga which tells us to believe in ourself, not to forget that it comes from absence of fear.A scene where subject gets electric shock while urinating, is possible only if urinated from close distance. I got to know that via one of the episodes of myth busters. Also who will take the risk?

","There is saying in India 'do jism or ek jaan' meaning 'Two bodies one soul'. This statement suit the relationship between hiccup and toothless. This was the relationship which I cherished from the movie, the most.It is worth watching for adults as well as children.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: It is excellent.Tone: The tone relies on story where it is learnt that dragons are not dangerous and instead of killing them, they can be raised as pets. It is constructed well.Music: Music is average.It is worth watching multiple times.",8,0,0,11 September 2017
Limitless," Well executed concept.
","It's obvious that when I first watched the movie, I enjoyed it way too much more then second or third time or so. Sometimes I wonder does that happen because of the factors I don't know or what. Still from what I have rated it tells us how much I have liked the movie. Although I would like to put light on, the general myth in which even Einstein believed that we don't use cent percent of our brains. Furthermore, avoiding that and looking at entertainment type and level and given concept even if untrue this movie is phenomenal.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The on screen effects while being at terrace of building and looking through pathway passing along streets, along with event recall after taking a NZT, are tremendous. If you are on certain drug that helps you act superiorly in some way - you can totally relate to it.Tone: Movie is set in tone where a person using 20 percent of his brain starts using hundred percent of his brain. It is a thriller executed nicely. You stay glued to your seat.Acting: Acting is average.Highly recommended.",8,0,0,31 August 2017
Inside Man," Bank Robbery - u'll love, despite it being a non-Ethical act!
","Tone, Script & Story: The story of perfect bank robbery. Why it is carried, because he (the robbery leader) can, obviously besides the financial motivation. What I liked: The entire wealth kept in the bank was untouched, except for one drawer. The point is the contents of that drawer were not disclosed. It happened to be stealing from the rich, someone who deserved even worse punishment. The other thing I liked is the officer played by Denzel gets something for him for a better (love) life.The movie plot follows the genre of mystery, I have highlighted my review as spoiler, but then that's the genre which gives you the most just before walking out of theatre. The movie keeps you quite engaged before heating its peak.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified. Music: An Indian track 'Chaiyya Chaiyya' runs at start and at end. It is quite good. Acting: Justified.Final Verdict: Bank Robbery - you will love, despite it being a non-Ethical act! It is worth watching.",8,1,1,7 August 2018
Jack Reacher," Ex veteran who takes responsibility to do justice!
","Tone, Script & Story: Jack Reacher was in defense. His one of the colleagues is framed for crime of killing out-five people. Before trial he asks for Jack Reacher to as if prove his innocence.When I first saw the movie it was all about the charisma surrounding Jack Reacher. He remembered the things just by taking a glance at them. How he portrayed unlike police each of his enemy was a trained killer.When watching it again there was something else that grabbed my attention more. I like it when I get to add something to my knowledge and it does not come as burden. Here it puts light on who are the people that join the defense? The answer is 1)Family trend, 2)patriotic reason, 3)gain job and finally 4)to legally handle things.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified.

","I loved the first movie from this franchise, so I had lots of hope and excitement. Sadly the movie was not up to that mark.I felt numb in most of the scenes. I felt like running away during first half. I did not enjoy the story with base containing star lord and his father.But I loved certain scenes. Groot steals the entire show, followed by mantis. I was waiting and waiting for the scene where Groot is taught to deploy something as shown in trailers. Other acts from groot were also awesome. The powers that mantis has is awesome too.You will love it if you are regular marvel fan.",7,2,5,5 May 2017
Titanic," Romance that did not sank with titanic!
","The movie puts light on the romance that Jack and Rose shared. Although Jack died that night but the love he placed in her heart will not die till she is alive. Titanic is among the first Hollywood movies that I got to see on television. I like this movie from the day I first saw it. It is just not about the emotions of the characters in the movie but the emotions of people who watch it as well.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: I got to know about huge investment made in construction of sets, water bodies and their working. Well I would say they all got well along (4/5).Tone: Movie takes us on a ride where two people fall in love but one dies as titanic sinks. It is how Rose has those emotions still with her and would go away only with her death. As they call now grown old Rose to explore sank titanic to find lost jewel.

He wins seekers position instead of any punishment. It was awesome.Harry potter as Seeker or khoji wins my opinion. The reason is in spite of wearing spectacles he is assigned such a position. I simply like that.Home is another point where my opinion is that harry could have been located at a better place. A place where he is respected may be with Hagrid. The life could have been made less troublesome.There is a scene where Hermione is in toilet and lies regarding entire situation.

","It's long gone when fourth installment of harry potter was released. Apart from the usual greatness of harry potter and its fantasy world, this review is more about just what the movie, made me feel at the end.Here in Indiam movies it's said, if it's not a happy ending than the movie has not yet ended. Up to a certain point in life we are brought up under protective cover. Also we are not exposed much, to blooming love at initial stages in our lives. We are introduced to concept of love marriage action all amongst adults. Now the harry potter world introduces a major tournament. Various institutes visit, bringing beautiful examples of masculinity and feminine's in.Well I kind of felt bad for Ron, when Hermione was getting line from that stud (maybe because a happy ending meant them being together with no obstacles).

Enemy at the Gates," Intense war drama & hide-n-seek between aces!
","My top favorite 'sniper' movies in the order are, 1) Shooter, 2) Enemy at the gates and 3) American Sniper. I am penning down this review after watching American Sniper. Enemy at the gates and American Sniper both are inspired from real events. The later gains more in its account by critics, despite being similar is maybe because of Clint Eastwood, the respect that he has earned through ages. When it comes to me, Enemy at the gates aces.It is shown how a Soviet sniper coming from a background of being peasant becomes a hero and inspiration for its people in war. It is also shown how a special sniper belonging to German army it's sent to take care of the business of our hero (Soviet sniper). It's shown how his colleague, a new found love interest and a child move into his (Soviet sniper) world during this war.Final verdict: What steals the show is the intense drama and the game of, hide n seek that goes on between the two snipers. It's worth adding to your collection.",9,0,1,15 July 2018
A Beautiful Mind," When I becomes us, illness becomes wellness!
","One of my closed ones has schizophrenia. To write review of this movie is to make sense of what I have understood about this mental illness in short.First of all I would like to talk about this movie. The movie is great, still to have clear idea regarding this illness I would suggest you to see a documentary. I did saw documentary named 'John Nash – A Brilliant madness'.It's every day struggle for the people suffering from this disease. They have to become strong and learn to distinguish between delusions, hallucinations and truth. The one who learns and adopt this practice overcomes and manages to become stable. This peculiar feature also highlights in john, and is shown nicely.After watching the movie and documentary, I concluded the movie to be little away from happened incidence in John Nash life. It seemed to me Russell Crowe was wrong choice. He was brilliant but when you see the documentary you see a totally different John.Having such illness, it becomes burden on one's family and colleagues, the social relations and family who takes care do worth much more are rare to find, as shown in movie.Everything in this world, living beings, non- living beings, beings which are conscious and beings which are not conscious have working relation between them that can be projected via rules of maths. Not all people get glimpse of this working relations. One of them who got the idea regarding this, was John Nash.Movie highly recommended.",9,0,1,6 August 2016

","What is the difference between these biographies, Sachin, the man who knew infinity, a beautiful mind compared with Mary Kom, Steve Jobs. The answer is the later portrays partial Biopic related to main aspect in subject's lives. With Steve Job even time being on side the justice was not done. I find it disappointing as I tend to like a Biopic complete in nature.With movies like a beautiful mind, Steve Jobs, Soorma and comparing these with documentaries John Nash: A Brilliant Madness, Steve Jobs: A man in the Machine and a press article I know how manipulative a movie can be. For me its okay but what surprised me the most is Critic's favoring the previous more than later. So I guess critics are overrated, that's that.",7,0,0,13 December 2018

","Tone, Script & Story: First thing First - After getting sold into slavery how can anyone perceive that life. It not only highlights that but put light on how this man doesn't lose hope for twelve years. Finally he gets together with his family.To have animals do our work is a different thing. We are conscious human beings who stand at the top of pyramid of known living beings. Thus if it works that way it's cool.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified.

Joker," Witness! It not that hard to make a good movie.
",The movie is a living example quoting 'It not that hard to make a good movie'. The elements used do not require rocket science math work to get going. Even after that it delivers 'class'.The storyline takes a psychological path and appears genuine.Phillips and Phoenix deliver precisely as a director and an actor (joker) in main lead.Final Verdict: The movie is worth watching.,8,1,4,7 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Minimum number of defenders giving win set adrenaline rush high!
","I liked the alien race based on concept of general, alpha and omega. Here on earth we can pretend God to be omega and further we can divide and subdivide human race. Yet the carving of Alien race and its supremacy in crafting war was awesome. Even more awesome was a weak race (human race) gains success in war. All of this happened, only with intelligence and efforts of two soldiers and a scientist, which gives one the adrenaline rush.The movie deserves 10/10.",9,0,2,12 April 2017
The Wolf of Wall Street," Graphic nature of an adult basic instinct will decide ur attitude towards the movie.
","It's no doubt that when it comes to directing the movie for day-to-day international audience the names that come to my mind are Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan and David Fincher. Myself however going through some data and polls one more name struck my mind. It was Martin Scorsese, his direction was the foremost reason, I decided to watch the movie 'The Wolf of Wall Street'.Its an average movie. There were two instances which where ethically nice. 1) Stealing from rich and 2) Owner writing cheque for a women in need. The sad part is apart from that nothing is considered about health, relationships, integrity, manners, respect, nothing but money and the animalistic drive to get more. In the run there was a lot of drinking, partying, and doing drugs. A lot of adult nature involved, so much that it was rated NC-17 (not R).Final Verdict: Graphic nature of a particular (adult) basic instinct drives men more than women. Thus my ratings.",8,1,3,27 June 2018
The Green Mile," Alls well that ends well or is it?
","The green mile is movie about Death Row guards at a penitentiary, set in the 1930's where a murderer is found to have supernatural powers. The story although rotates around him murdering girl children which proves out wrong. He still is murder convict and asks for death.A very beautiful story about a man with psychic powers, who gives up on life due to all that ugly which is present in world and he has to face most of it in his head. every person who watches this movie has sympathy with this man.Highly recommended to all believers of god and who consistently invest in being human.rating: 10/10",10,1,2,28 September 2015

By not being in main stream of connectivity with his daughter as well as a woman where he usually used to spend his night things are not in favor of the wrestler.

Kong: Skull Island," Fantastic treat of some lost world.
","I went to watch the movie with average expectations and I found out that most of them were fulfilled. I would agree with most of the fellow reviewers that movie is purely colored action entertainment and expecting else might be not cool.I watched the Hindi dubbed version and found the following things. I liked Tom hiddleston in positive role. Brie Larson was definitely not a good pick (beauty) for our beast if that was our case. I most liked John C. Reilly with his broken language.There is some part of movie still coming out, after the end credits and in my opinion that should have been included before end credits. That ending however raises only below average expectations for the sequels.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The storm, flora and fauna, the green atmosphere, the petroleum absorbed surfaces, aurora borealis, the native people and their appearance, all were fantastic. The negative entities were all carved in ugly appearance, giving one the horror feel required.Tone: Tone was the action between the positives and the negatives and it was carved well. A spoiler - Kong was on human side.Music: Music was below average.Acting: Other actors acted as average.",8,2,7,10 March 2017
Shooter," Thrilling Sniper!
","If you were given chance to be in defense, what post would have you opted for. For me without any doubt it would have been sniper. But I am not in defense for a few reasons. It stays clear that I like heroes in single as lead. For example if we consider animated universe I like spider man, superman, flash or anybody portrayed in single lead over a group. The movie is how a highly trained sniper is drawn into murder charges by high authority people and how he gains his revenge. The genre is thriller, best of its kind, It is a must watch.rating: 8.5/10.",9,1,1,9 September 2017
Inception," Nolan deserves an Oscar!
","Well I would review this topic from my level of understanding and judgement.While judging it for the first time, I was not quite impressed. It was later, that I realised it was because of the bar that was set, set by director Christopher Nolan. A few movies like 'Edge Of Tomorrow' went through my mind to set the right idea of expectation and delivery.I am not happy with the visual appeal with most of recent movies and inception is no different. Damn it! It even got an Oscar for that. It's the director that needs to be praised most, the research carried out, the story laid are unparallel.",9,0,1,10 July 2018
Sherlock Holmes," Entertaining - worth adding to your collection!
","I would first discuss three things that I liked in this movie the most.1) The eccentric characterization of characters in lead. The happy go lazy attitude of Sherlock and his bizarre experiments until he finds something solid to work upon. To add further it's about the other lead the good guy Watson, who despite of all odds cannot keep away from Sherlock even after considering all his losses.2) The second thing I liked was pre-planning the execution of the fights all in imagination at once. It was all shown in slow motion. It was tremendous and mesmerizing.3) The third thing that I liked was cinematography. It was impeccable. I sometimes feel that comes mostly with the budget.Tone, Script & Story: The movie highlights one of the cases Sherlock and his team dealt with.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Direction was good. Directors (Guy Ritchie's) three best in order until today are - 1) Snatch (2000), 2) Sherlock Holmes (2009) and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011). Screen play was very good. Cinematography was excellent. Music: Justified. Acting: Acting was very good.Final Verdict: The movie is Entertaining. It is worth adding to your collection!",8,2,2,12 October 2018

I liked the romantic take between two robots. I also liked the take where future human don't just want to survive but live.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: A robot surviving after apocalypse fulfilling his directive. The barren earth, the garbage of satellites around planet earth, the space, the space ship, robot design as per function, etcetera have been crafted very well.Tone: The romantic take between two robots has been developed nicely. Along with romance the story is developed where humans return planet earth after 700 years. The struggle to take over space ship from automatic control. Everything goes well with the tone.Music: Music is average.Final verdict: It is worth saving in your DVD collection.",8,0,0,16 September 2017
Arrival," Exceptional Sci-fi
","I got to see the movie quite after some time of its release date in India. After watching the trailers, it was on my priority list to watch this movie. Well I would say first half of the movie was above average and second half was exceptional special because of the twist and the original content.The kind of panic created amongst humans, is something that I at some time before would not have imagined. Today I think such type of panic could be possible.Direction: Director, Denis Villeneuve's work as prisoners and sicario did not attract me much, but his direction for Arrival was exceptional.Screenplay: Screenplay was average.Cinematography: Cinematography was above average. I liked the scene when camera rotates around set military base.Tone: I have always liked Sci-fi. When it comes to aliens, I always like to accept them as Friends. Thus the tone of the movie was something I liked. I t would take someone with little science know how to understand the movie. To go further non- linear time, well that's very difficult to understand, but that won't spoil your movie experience.Music: Violin music at the end was charming.Acting: Acting was average.Aliens were here to explain Amy Adams, importance of her genes, the ones which can perceive non-linear time. She needed to reproduce. Well that was something I found awesome. Just saying that because after reading some reviews I felt people dint get that part.",9,4,10,13 December 2016
The Terminal," An ideal movie.
","The terminal is movie about a man from Krakozhia (a country in east) who has to stay at JFK airport in New York, due to problems going in his own country and lacking command over English. What make's 'the terminal' special is all the elements movie has got, and by element I mean all the stories it comprises of. The main story is of the man (Viktor Navorski) stranded at airport, who wins everybody's hearts. There's a story of an Indian man, who has been long working on airport, since murdering police official in India who thinks of Viktor as an agent. There's a story of a troubled couple, the women from which loves to read, for whom Viktor falls. There's another story of two young person's falling in love and getting married, all with help of Viktor. There's story of a person carrying medicine for his father not permitted to go any further because of airport rules and Viktor tricks the main authority by helping the man. Winning hearts of officials, finding way to gain money are others.The story revolves around Viktor who is there to fulfill his sentiments related to his Father. The movie is what I call lovely. In the end the purpose of Navorski is fulfilled. The best part about the movie I liked was the napoleon story that women conveys to Viktor and drug incident. The only disappointing part in the movie was Viktor not getting to have the women even after showing his exceptional skills, especially in constructing a beautiful architecture. That's the only reason it loses its full marks from me. It's a great movie to watch with entire family.Highly recommended!",10,2,2,29 September 2015

All these numbers define the greatness of this movie.When I first saw this movie I did not knew what happens at end. It was mystery for me. When I got to know that it was a high class entertainment. I would like to add don't go for much of the reviews just trust the numbers from IMDb.

Parasite," Original, Unconventional but Overrated!
","To follow the trailer, I was not interested, but then the movie held itself high in IMDb trends. Thus I decided to watch it. The movie is South Korean and one needed subtitles to understand it. Sadly this was too much and I gave up after ten minutes of run time. I would like to add the names of people with mentioned country and neighborhood are quite confusing and it takes effort which is escalated even more if you are to understand it with subtitles.A day came when I decided to again give it a try. The reason being Oscars this time. The movie won four Oscars. After searching for hindi version I settled for youtube narration for one fifth of time. What did I conclude was is everything associated was good enough but then still it was overrated. Once again my belief of awards being overrated stood concrete.Final Verdict: The story is not something good on the senses neither in the category all's well that ends well. However it presents side(s) worth knowing. I would like to see it in a language I am more comfortable with in future.",8,2,6,26 February 2020

One of them wants to end (by causing world WAR III) humanity and other save it.This is a mutant story so pros and cons are mostly associated with those evolved ones.Pros (what I liked): How angry (child) Magneto's crush metal surroundings. The construction of the Cerebro and its working, further how it finds the similar ones (nice to see all of them with different power). Charles fooling the militants at the entrance. The Helmet and its logic. The huge dish moving scene that demonstrates Magnetos power. The plane logic saying it to be built by mutant (fact file: there really exists such aircraft built by humans). The coin scene and the inter battle between (mutants) that destroys missiles.Cons (what I disliked): The killing of mutant who adapts to surroundings, despite the nice scenic representation.Final Verdict: Currently I don't remember of any prequels better this one. It is perhaps the best prequel ever (despite usual goofs).",8,1,2,2 February 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Trilogy
","Who is your favorite director when it comes to movies which are released to serve audience at international level? Most certainly the answer would be Christopher Nolan. If you would have asked me same question, I would say Steven Spielberg (first) followed by Christopher Nolan(second) and David Fincher (third). I think that may change in future.Today when I look for the movies related to comics (or characters developed based on some fantasy series). I am not fully satisfied. The reason is computer generated graphics (mostly) followed by poor development of story. This is where Nolan shines. The dark knight series which he has given us have got very good story. Same is the case for his other works such as Inception and Interstellar, but they look sliding away when visuals are considered (in my opinion), even if story is fabulous.A good director will always try to give us something new in his new movie, which is why may be Nolan stopped after third installment. The movies are worth adding to your DVD collection.My Rating: Batman Begins: 8/10 The Dark Knight: 9/10 The Dark Knight Rises: 9/10",9,0,1,18 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Keeping hopes low, saved my day.
","Went to see the movie with my expectations, keeping low, so I would say I was not highly disappointed. Without getting much into detail I would enlist pros and cons.Cons: Dialogs appeared incomplete or meaningless in few parts of movie maybe because I watched in Hindi. Story quality is below average, villain building up rivalry between two superheroes is weak. Idea to bring monster in existence, with somebody's blood & a dead body of an alien, seems illogical. Low standard of superheroes with super-high standard of destruction caused.Pros: I liked Ben Affleck as batman and other characters in general.",7,0,2,1 June 2017
Amélie," Not enough words to describe its greatness.
","The story is about one of the introvert girl who starts making changes in life of people surrounding her after one successful incidence. She discovers love in the process and accepts him in his life.The above two sentences just can't summary up, how exceptionally good this movie is. Cinematography is great. Narration in between the scenes adds to the general appealing. Movie is artistic. Covers appropriate number of elements for its success.Highly recommended.",9,0,1,30 August 2017
The Sixth Sense," The greatest psychological horror movie!
",I am sorry to have not understood the movie when I saw it for the first time. What I got to know was the child could see ghosts and gradually even solved their problems. If one would think the poisoned girl incident and talking to passed away grandmother even this incidences can turn the movie appealing. I later got to know about Bruce Willis Secret. May be it happened because I fast forwarded and skipped the last part. Yeah my bad. It achieved even greater feat in my knowledge after knowing the actual ending.M. Night Shyamalan has given us this jewel. It's hard to believe same person has given us movies like The Village and Signs. Well that does not bring him down.I am not into horror movies but I do like the psychological take. The Sixth Sense goes in my book as the greatest psychological horror movie I have ever seen.,9,0,0,24 May 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Final installment: dark and extremely successful in catching nerves.
","There are so many movies we like, but time is always the main constraint. It matters when we have seen the movie. Harry Potter is a series that we have grown with. I remember, I never read those books. I remember how I have waited about an entire year till summer, when the movies were to be first premiered on TV channels in India. Sometimes 2 sometimes 3 and finally 4 were amongst the movies that I got to watch at the weekends.A great salute to J.K Rowling to have come with such a series. She is the most deserving candidate for all the praise associated with Harry Potter. The elements that have been included in the movies are simply unparallel. She thought of everything and put all of them in line with tremendous creativity. To pick any one of them as your best one is very much difficult.When the cast of the movies were selected, it was not known how they would grow up in. It might be so that some of them grow up different than writer's imagination. Also not everybody including me is fan of reading books. It was good to see the movies. However not everything was included. An extremely graphical and animated version of TV series which includes everything would be a dream coming true.The final 3 movies were something where adult world comes into existence. To be frank they were different and again I would praise the writer that handles it so well. I remember my youngest sister saying she doesn't get those movies. However I like the act of Heroism. The character in which Snape's true nature is known and the wand logic via which Voldemort is defeated are tremendous. Just a wish, I wanted last two parts to be single movie, its one of the main reasons why none of them score a ten.",9,1,2,1 April 2016
The Matrix," what a movie!
","Before going any further, let me tell you that my review is going to be a general review about matrix trilogy.Set in future with a very stylish approach, Matrix consist of movies consisting of alternate world ruled by the machines. Humans are harvested here in huge fields. Machines create a world for them which is meant to be error free. This is achieved with help of programs. Example of such programs are agents. There are programs , there are anti-programs doing there work for which they have been constructed, thus trying to maintain balance.Zion is a free city situated underground, for they know their exposure will bring their end via machines. Although underground these people are advanced, they have ships which travel through severs to guarantee well being of Zion. A man from Zion is believed to get to someone who would be their savior(conveyed as 'He is the one'). Do they find him? Does he fulfills his destiny movie is all about that.An alternate view of an artist can be consider spiritual in nature where this world is a matrix and salvation is way of getting freed. An interesting thought really! I would recommend the trilogy to everyone, specially sci-fi fans.",10,1,2,28 September 2015
Godzilla," Mother Nature cares, but never take her for Granted!
","A monster is created. How does that happen? Nuclear traces falling on some creature making it stronger by being its food.Is there need to worry? The answer is maybe not. Mother Nature takes care of everything.But one should notice not to take Mother Nature for granted. For she may require the time, that would happen to be enough to wipe entire human race.This is one such movie where Godzilla is shown as positive entity.Awesome movie! Highly recommended.",10,0,2,21 April 2017
Looper," TK mutation and final scene, u will relish watching!
","Tone & Story: Time travel movies generally appeal to the sci-fi watching audience. No one knows how accurately they are made, but they ,when made nicely, give you best two hour time spent or so. This movie deals with time travel and assassins whose lives are bounded to be spent till there time is over. They are called Loopers. Rainmaker is a person coming into future existence who kills every looper. The story is further based on how this mass assassination is changed. I liked the script developed on TK mutation as well as revelation of final scene before the movie ends (4.5/5).Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: They were all very good (4/5).Music: Music was good (3/5).Acting: Acting was very good as well (3.5/5).Final Verdict: It is worth adding to your DVD collection [(4/5) (9/10)].",9,0,1,2 October 2017
50_50," A serious subject (cancer) handled in a humorous way.
","The movie is inspired from true story. It gives us a glimpse of a true cancer patient with respect to family and friends and the process of treatment.A few instances that lift up this humorous treat as per my perception are stated as follows :1) The character of Levitt's best friend-Seth Rogen, his friendship, his nature, his attitude, his swearing - give us idea of one's male friends in an entertaining way.2) How they dealt with a cheating girlfriend, her getting caught followed by breakup, I mean how it unfolded was epic.3) The other patients associating along with Adam while chemo was a humorous treat as well.Final Verdict: It is worth adding to your collection. It is a serious subject of cancer, handled in a humorous way.",8,1,1,30 October 2018
Deadpool," A worthy badass - DeadPool
","DeadPool takes us on a journey of how he revenged a person responsible for making him a monster and putting him away from his newly found heavenly love.Pros: The nature of deadpool laughing out of every bad situation is tremendous. His nature matches his colleagues nature at bar, both are excellent at par. Although deadpool rules. This role was meant for Ryan Reynolds. DeadPools girlfriend is gorgeous in every possible manner ;). The action sequences are exceptional. Villain is killed instead of getting imprisoned. A great movie in a budget little higher than 30 million dollars. Great work by the production studio, which is not marvel (to note). A positive ending (although I want him to get better looking again in the sequels).Cons: Referring to the last point mentioned above, a positive ending not that positive.Rating: 8.0/10",9,2,10,12 February 2016
300," Exceptional visual effects!
","When I first watched this movie, I watched it in Hindi. It made my movie experience even more wonderful. Being one of the English movies that I started watching when I first started watching R rated English movies. It added to the experience. This movie has been my one of favorites since a long time.The visual effects are simply superb. The scenes that this movie has got against Persians are superb. How a king comes into existence by killing huge beast. How a Queen governs her duties. How they handle the messenger. How the captain loses his son. How captain fights a after that? How they find out traitor. How the king and all associated soldiers lay down their life and invite other Spartans. Oracles and Ephors together was something I disliked. Oracles were beautiful. Ahu-Ahu entire force humming at once pumped Adrenalin high.After watching this movie I was attracted towards other work of Zack Snyder, sadly I found none of this level.",8,0,5,21 April 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," real concern, unrealistic tackle, deserving fate (villian)
","Kingsman is a movie about secret service, the people of this secret service help to keep balance in the entire world by keeping down the crime levels. Now what happens is a member of this elite service is killed, thus a training type mission is carried out for recruitment of a new member out of five individuals. As the story runs, it is found out that one of the organizations in charge, which deal with sim cards has actually prepared a method to convert every individual into psychopath by just listening to some kind of music. Only those with a circuit fitted into their bodies (neck) are immune, except for the choice that circuit can make ones head explode and result in their death. All of kings man die due to this except a few, just because their chief along with many chief's (of various organization's) come together with villain.This villain only does these because he thinks population as virus and he feels for pressure on nature. It's shown that he is some kind of spiritual entity. Pressure on nature is already handled by our nature via diseases like AIDS. Still taking a drastic step is questionable as by statistics population growth will slow down. It may be justified as people act only properly, if there is some kind of fear. Example is fear of Boss in office where people are employed. If that is happening a lot needs to change like a person employed for what he desires. The trained individual is not trained for any sort of combat, still manages well, a negative mark there. The movie is great; I still have certain amount of sympathy for villain. A must watch; I would add.Rating: 8.0/10",8,2,7,6 October 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Faith in humanity restored!
","More than place (Hacksaw Ridge) where the war was fought, this movie highlights is the medic Desmond Doss who saved numerous lives without carrying a gun or firing a shot. It makes me say a quote 'Faith in humanity restored'.I find Oscars overrated, but here -this movie has won two Oscars, which makes me say, 'Faith in Oscars restored'.The movie comes from the director Mel Gibson, the one who directed the passion of the Christ and apocalypto. He stands new coming into my conscience and what I would like to say is he is one hell of a director.Final Verdict: Movie coming from a director who understands faith so well is a reason why justice is done to the subject so nicely. Even if you are not a part of country involved in war shown in this movie, please watch it for the humanity of Desmond Doss.",8,2,2,2 August 2018
Contact," Awesome treat in defining first contact with Aliens.
",The movie is about how humans establish a contact with an Alien and are successful in creating heavy machinery which is capable of unknown possibilities. There are two of the same kinds of machinery made of which second is bought into use since one of them fails.Various possibilities arise of how this machine is going to work. There arises the possibility of creation of some kind of worm holes through which lady astronomer travels. To the people of earth the apparatus gives a failed experiment as the container carrying lady falls due to gravity.The reality is lady astronomer 'Jodie Foster' travels for about 18 hours through various worm holes visits a place 'an alien world' talks to living beings from other world and comes back.The idea of time differentiating in such a way is tremendous. Although I feel our organic tendencies may also get affected. What they have produced is a gem!,9,1,1,7 June 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," An intense emotional treat, where a father-son duo rises above all hardships.
","The movie is based on true incidences. Will Smith plays a Father who is poor, has a wife and son. He is never going to let his son go through the hardships he went. As the movie runs Will and his wife lag behind from paying his dues. His wife leaves him and his son. He goes through a lot, but secures a good life for him and his son.For me it's best performance, given by Will Smith till date. If considered father-son duo, they leave you astonished. Hardships of the real world are captured well.Final Verdict: It is an intense emotional treat, where a father-son duo rises above all hardships.",9,0,0,15 April 2018
Jurassic Park," Awesome Sci-fi take!
","I still remember this movie was among my first Hollywood movies to be seen on television. I always like the sci-fi take (here getting DNA and bringing up lost species, marking area, carnivores-herbivores, violent nature of certain species and so on) in these sorts of movies. The other movie that comes this close to the above description when it comes to my thoughts is Godzilla.I rate it a point less only because I disliked the destruction of park - supporting script, else it deserves full marks for the scientific elements it has got.",8,2,2,5 September 2017
The Martian," highly recommended space ride!
","The movie is about a man played by Matt Damon, who is left behind on planet Mars by the space crew which visits the planet and returns to earth, they think they lost him in an accident. Matt Damon has to survive a long time before anybody finds he's alive and rescue measures are adopted. He is an intelligent botanist who uses his own poop to grow potatoes on Mars, thus colonizing the planet; he also learns to establish contact via older but easier means. First mission to send extra food fails and crops are also lost in some kind of accident. But a total different strategy to save him totally works out. He also becomes a pirate, enjoys a status of iron man. The same crew, who left him, brings him back.The Martian offer's much more that is shown in trailers, for me it was a ride full of enjoyment and not even a single moment of boredom. The director of NASA is a good constructed character that rules to save astronauts', by not sending crew back to extended mission, thus not jeopardizing their lives. The tolerating audience of west is great, when it comes about religion (cross). If his information would have been kept classified still it would have been great script to save humanity from any type of let down. The decision to bring him back is left on crew itself. I would have added an extra mark if the script worked out well, so as to confirm his death by crew members as the return could have delayed. For Mars with thin atmosphere it would have been an ethical thing to do, still a highly recommended movie to watch.",9,2,59,2 October 2015
