Midnight in Paris," I wish I would be I Paris someday
","I'm not talking about the storyline here but my experience. If you want to read, read or please scroll down.I think this movie has something to be attracted with. Paris indeed is an epicentre for arts & culture. The way Gil Pender introduced us with the amazing Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and many others.... it's what an art loving audience would love to watch. Even if you aren't an arts & culture lover, never been acquainted with their famous writings before, you'll feel it enjoyable too. Maybe, in midnight dreams you would have a nice time with them, who knows? (just kidding) ðŸ˜ŠOverall, it's soothing and surreal one to enjoy.",9,1,1,29 March 2020
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," The Perfect Time killer
","I would like to make it short. If you have seen the story summary, then you already know about the plot, nothing to talk about it.
Literally the superclass acting by the charecters representing a strong story.
You'll never be bored with it",9,0,0,28 May 2020
Vanilla Sky," Copy of 'Abres los ojos'
","It's copy, but if u watch it first time you're gonna love it. Twisting plots are absolutely a gem to enjoy. Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz nailed it.
Actually I don't see copied movies but this one really caught my attention. Good to watch.",8,1,1,16 June 2020
