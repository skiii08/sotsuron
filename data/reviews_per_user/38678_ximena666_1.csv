Sucker Punch," Terrible , boring and dumb !
","Wow oh boy this movie is bad , the story is stupid and sexist I don't know what the director was thinking other than having a soft porn story camouflaged under action type . Of course was not expecting anything good but I was surprised by the high score from the IMDb users and also by the mixed reviews . I should have followed my hunch that looking at the trailer told me better not waste your time on this one but I wanted to give it a try because I like fantasy type movies and is hard to find stories in which we have a heroine not a hero , sadly the heroine storyline was a mixture of some porn fantasy and some Japanese manga There is nothing I could rescue from the movie as OK , event the effects linked to the spacing out of our table dancer/heroine are not enough to help the movie. Of course the high score is from the target audience of young males with too much testosterone that fail to see the message between lines of the underworld of woman trafficking and slavery going on around the world . All the 'dancing' made look like they enjoyed sending the wrong message of fun and camaraderie when in reality is pure slavery and exploitation not fun . My advise don't waste your time or money in this one.",1,20,39,3 April 2011
