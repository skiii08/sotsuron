Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Abraham Lincoln: The really BORING Vampire Hunter
","I just saw this movie the other night. The movie tries to capture the life of the main character Abraham Lincoln. You will see him growing up, losing his parents and see him developing his skills as a vampire hunter. You never really feel anything for him though. He wants to kill some vampires because of revenge. So he goes out training with this master vampire hunter guy who is like a rock star screwing all these chicks. You will see Abraham train with his weapon of choice the SILVER AXE. It's really a joke, it reminded me of some bad action b-movies where the hero is getting trained by the super cool teacher. His AXE skills are a joke. Maybe he had some fight training especially for this movie, but it's just not believable at all. Abraham looks like some 90's kid who got a toy AXE for Christmas and goes out swinging with the thing like a retard. Well anyways, he goes out chopping Vampire Heads of like he has some special talent for it.I didn't connect with Lincoln or any of the other characters in this movie. This had mainly to do with really poor acting and cheese writing. In some more serious and dramatic moments in the movie everything just don't seem believable and feels really forced.A little plus on this movie, is it's CGI action scenes. It has some stunning visuals like for example the horse chase scene where Lincoln tries to capture some long time vampire foe. But overall, I don't think CGI makes up for all the bad stuff in this movie.In some parts of the movie I actually fell asleep because of the really shallow and cheesy scenes about love, romance and character development. It really felt as if those were fillers between the action scenes. But whenever I heard some loud slash sounds, I woke up, but soon as the action blood spoiled scene was over (which gave me some satisfaction and entertainment), I'd close my eyes again and sleep like a baby.",3,3,8,29 July 2012
Django Unchained," Django is not a BINGO for Tarantino!
","OK. Let me tell you this, I am not a hater of Tarantino. I just wasn't all that impressed about this movie. I like half of the film, that's why I gave it a 5 out of 10. Now let me tell you why the other half wasn't that good in my opinion.First of all, haven't we seen this before? Tarantino uses the same structure in scenes over and over again. I like his movies, but this was too much of the same. We have seen this before. I thought it would be different this time around, and he would surprise me again. Secondly, too much scenes just for the shock. Black dildo + predictable over the top blood scene ending. Thirdly, a dirty south hip hop track halfway in the movie? Come on. Have more style Tarantino.(In the voice of Christoph Waltz) 'DjangO is not a BINGO for Tarantino!'",5,7,12,24 January 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Scrambled Spidey Mess with Batman & Robin horror flashbacks
","You know when you have great ingredients to cook a great meal but somehow manage to mess up your dish entirely? Well here we have great actors, great writers, incredibly talented C.G.I artists, an enormous budget and best of all one of the most iconic Marvel super hero of all time and yet somehow they managed to make an unstructured and unbalanced mess out of this movie.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 goes from comedy to intense drama to high speed super hero slow motion action scenes. It takes you on a mood swing trip as if you were a monkey on speed. At first you think: 'Hell yes! Spider-Man! I am in for a ride! Bring it on!' But suddenly you realize that this movie is completely out of balance. The tone of the whole movie leaves you in a state of confusion. It doesn't seem to be a streamlined movie at all. Where does it go? Do we laugh now? Do we cry now? What is all this nonsense? Of course they have promoted this movie through the roof with showing off trailers and video clips of high tech 2014 ready C.G.I action scenes. It's safe to say that TASM2 looks stunning with crazy super slow motion micro detailed comic book flavored scenes. But at some point it was as if the different C.G.I scenes had to compete against each other to stand out, and therefore they became somewhat of a distraction of the whole flow of the movie. This is also the problem with basically all other scenes. The drama isn't bad, the acting isn't bad, it's good in fact. But they don't build up to it, they just magically appear. We suddenly get pulled out because of yet another deeply romantic love scene or yet another highly dramatic plot twist and I ask myself so many times during this movie: This doesn't make sense at all, and why am I seeing this now at this precise moment, please just carry on with the story! Didn't Marc Webb ever heard of the principle: 'Less Is More?'. It's more like 'more is bigger and better equals more drama, more comedy and let's trow in another bad guy!' with this flick.In all seriousness, it really felt as if there were too many people involved in making decisions in this movie. I imagine Marc Webb trying to do his own thing in his little working room and suddenly some big corporate Sony guy comes in and says: NO WE NEED MORE ACTION AND MORE SUPER BAD GUYS..! And... errr... EXPLOSIONS!!! And there, we have Marc Webb all teary eyed wanting to just make a 500 Days Of Summer Spider-Man remix. Well Marc, you can't just do your emotional thing and trying to mix and match this with big budget superhero movies. If there is one company that has it down (and I passionately share the opinion of many other true believers) it's Marvel. So Marc or Sony, if you guys are reading this, you have told your origin story of Spider-Man (again), but now is the time to give back the torch to Marvel so we can continue to see Spider-Man in a much greater light.So my score is 4 out of 10: 3 points for great actors (1 for Garfield, 1 for Dehaan and 1 for that subway pigeon that took a giant dump on Emma Stone's head) and 1 point for that Asian guy who made the realistic Spidey fart effect during the swinging scene in daylight NY.",4,22,46,29 April 2014
Les Misérables," Too Much Vibrato Hugh!
","OK! So here is my review for Les Misérables.It's a beautiful modern musical movie and a great take on a true classic. I haven't seen the original real life musical in the theaters, but I can say this: Anne Hathaway HOLY SH*T! She gave the best performance ever. I will not try to spoil anything in this review.The vocal performances: The performances from all the actors in this movie are good. Although, some noticeably better than others. You can really pick out the 'real' musical singers/actors and the ones that were especially trained for this movie. Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman weren't the best vocally. Let me tell you why. It was obvious Crowe and Jackman were lacking in tonal reach in some of the songs. They stayed in their reach, and the results were a bit of hit and miss. Russell was in my opinion noticeably better and clearer in his singing than Jackman. But maybe this was because he had less songs to sing. Jackman on the contrary had A LOT of songs to sing for his leading roll: Jean Valjean. His song performances weren't all that good. Not bad, but just not that good. There was emotion, for sure. A lot of emotion. But acting is different than singing. When singing and acting are in harmony, you have an amazing performance, but at times there was just too much acting in Jackman's singing. His 'acting as if I am singing good' sometimes didn't make sense at all. Sometimes he just blew out random tones he tried to sing in a sentence as a reaction to a question or conversation he is in. Very confusing from a musical point of view. Hugh mostly sang in key though, but it was all sung in melodies within his very own tonal reach which results in sometimes boring and predictable melodies. Also, he really over did the vibrato effect in his voice. It was as if there was a big bee buzzing and flying in his throat the whole time. Seriously, vibrato is a cool effect, but not constantly.Now enough about Hugh's overdone vibrato, now on to the good stuff: Anne Hathaway. Anne Hathaway. Anne Hathaway. She should win an award.Amanda Seyfried sang beautifully but didn't have the pure rawness of Anna. She was perfect for her role though. Sasha Cohen Baron and Bonham Carter were a good comical contrast for all the seriousness in this movie. It would be stupid not to mention all the other actors. But I don't know their names because they aren't big movie stars. But let me tell you, these actors were AMAZING singers and performers. The little french revolution kid was amazing. So were all the others. Lastly, it was all so EMOTIONAL! Sometimes so emotional that some people got really uncomfortable during some intimate song performances. You know it's a good performance when the cool guys before you are trying not to cry.So my verdict, 7 out of 10.",7,2,4,24 January 2013
Life," Laughable Bad Taste: A Joke that feels like a 'Life' time
","I don't get why this movie has such good reviews, so I had to write something about it myself. 'LIFE' is not the Sci Fi space movie you would hope to see. When space is one of the settings of a movie I kind of hope to be it as deep and mysterious like space is it self. 'LIFE' isn't it. The movie is very fast paced, much too graphic without any mystique and we don't really get a chance to really care about any of the characters. The movie has very bad taste in it's visual and dramatic effects. LIFE has also a very difficult time to set a mood. Is this a comical movie? Or do I need to take this scene seriously? I was laughing through out the more 'dramatic' scenes of the movie, but it actually had to be a serious moment. It's just very underwhelming. Although 'LIFE' has it's strong moments, you have to wait a long time to get there. The opening scene was strong and kind of great. You really hope this beauty would continue through out the movie, but it doesn't. What follows is very underwhelming for a movie that has such a beautiful setting. Space is mysterious and you would hope to see a more meaningful movie about it. What we see is yet another Hollywood cliché which cares more on making it big at the box office than creating a meaningful experience. The movie certainly tests your patience because you have to go through a lot of predictable cliché movie moments and horrible action scenes. At the end of the movie you feel you have been told a very bad joke which could have been told to you in 3 minutes.",3,6,13,26 March 2017
