Howl's Moving Castle," Now THAT'S Love
","Almost everyone who watches Howl's Moving Castle praises its eloquent condemnation of senseless war or its inventive fantasy world—and rightly so. But I don't think the movie is about either of those things. At its heart, Howl's Moving Castle is the coming-of-age love story of the flamboyant, elusive, immature wizard Howl and the mousy Sophie. If you read it as such and watch it closely, the somewhat puzzling details resolve themselves—and you will even learn about love. Yes, this movie is unusually complex. But, never fear, you're in the hands of Hayao Miyazaki, a master storyteller, so you can trust that there is coherent meaning in every detail. I recommend watching the film at least twice: once just to enjoy and again to trace the various subplots (the missing prince, the draft-dodging, the curse-breaking, the time-traveling, the villain-vanquishing). You'll begin to find significance in the gentlemanly service of 'Turniphead,' Sophie's shifting age, and Howl's first line in the movie, 'There you are, sweetheart. Sorry I'm late. I was looking everywhere for you.' Even though Howl's Moving Castle is set in a fairy tale world, complete with witches, wizards, and demons, I find that the main story is readily applicable to the non-magical human. Here's how I would summarize it: Sophie and Howl are two dissatisfied loners, but they find the capability and the courage to protect each other and the family that they acquire through their adventures. Along the way, Howl's Moving Castle teaches us that true love . . .1. Enables us to see the potential in each other. 2. Grants us the courage we need to protect our loved ones. 3. Can prevent or end 'idiotic war.' 4. Spreads beyond two people and embraces those around them. 5. Doesn't require us to be flawless or boring. But my favorite lesson on love occurs at the end of the movie when, in typical fairy tale fashion, Prince Charming finally appears to claim Sophie as his 'one true love.' She, however, is all but oblivious to the prince because she's so unapologetically in love with Howl, the man that she's made a life with. The much-neglected truth here: true love, despite its challenges, is much more magical than a fairy tale love that doesn't require us to struggle and grow. There are lots of flawed ideas about love out there, but every time I finish Howl's Moving Castle, I experience an uncanny feeling of recognition that's best summed up by a song title from the soundtrack: 'Now that's Love.'",10,0,1,14 February 2013
