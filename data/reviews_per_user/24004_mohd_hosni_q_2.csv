Skyfall," One of the Best 2012 movies!
","What a great movie it is, I was never a big fan of James Bond movies nor Edele music but this movie changed that forever.I went back to watch all James Bond movies from the start after watching this one.Looking forward to watch more in the future of this quality, it was really entertaining on the IMAX and there was never a dull moment. The sequence of events was fast, the story development was nice.Watched the movie like 3 times already, Daniel Craig did the movie its justice this time. He was brilliant and I would love to see him again in the next James Bond movie.",9,1,8,8 January 2013
Man of Steel," Just WOW
","I was not so impressed with the third installment of Iron Man, so I did not put that much of expectations on Man Of Steel because I don't want to be disappointed in the end.I'm a big fan of Superman comics and was reading these as early as 5 years old, but (believe it or not) watched any superman movie before. Well, from the opening of the movie until the end I could not take my eyes off the iMax nor move. The movie was way beyond any expectations I had for it, it literally blew me away in every possible way. The music played by Zimmer matched everything i watched and gave me goosebumps at some scenes. That electrical shock through my spine, down to my arms that I can see my arm hair stands.Few movies had such an impact and one of them was The Dark knight Trilogy, the common thing between the two is not the justice league .. It's Nolan!I think he was a genius coming up with the unexpected as everyone was looking for a reboot of the old movies. I watched the 1978 movie after Man of Steel to know what was all the fuzz about and it looked to me more of a shattered pieces of everything Superman did in comics collected in a movie.He did not follow the others steps (why would he?) and came up with a brilliant movie that was awesome in everything. From choosing the cast of the movie, the music, the story line .. Man I just can't say enough ..",10,2,8,27 June 2013
