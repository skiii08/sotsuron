The Blair Witch Project," Creepy ain't it?
","I didn't know much about this movie when I first started watching it, at first I just thought it was about a boring documentary in which three slacker kids wanted to hit it big by making their story about a witch. I was frightfully surprised when I soon realized that their camping trip was soon to turn out for the worse.  After the movie was over and that last horrifying 10 minutes of the film was completed I found myself wondering if this was an actual tape from those three kids disappearance.  Thankfully this isn't an actual real tape but rather just a not so regular movie.  I saw the film about 2 days ago but the story line and plot are still very clear in my mind and still make me think that this could actually happen and that although just a story, it still makes me wonder what if...",10,1,2,4 July 1999
American Beauty," A good movie, not a great one.
","This movie was written very well and it gives the depth that lets you get inside these people's heads, but the story itself seemed to be familar.  An idea of a mild-manored man losing his barrings and quiting his job and pretty much not caring about anything or anybody seems too familar to me. But this movie is full of surprises and this main theme isn't all that is in it.  The characters keep you wondering about what they are really like up until the last few seconds of the movie and this isn't the only surprises you get in the movie... without ruining the ending i will just say that you should always look closer....",10,0,0,11 October 1999
The Matrix," Wow...
",This is all I have to say about this movie.  I had somewhat of a low expectation going into this movie but once this movie got going there was no turning back.  The fight sequences and special effects in this movie were well beyond Blade and well beyond Titanic.  If you haven't seen this movie yet...what's wrong with you! I know I will see this movie at least one more time in the theaters before it goes out and I will buy this movie on DVD because this movie is just too great not to watch again.,10,0,0,3 April 1999
Donnie Darko," It sounds like some sort of superhero or something..
","Well, who's to say he isn't?  Donnie Darko remains as one of the greatest films made within the last 3 years.  It's hard not to get caught up in the new age 'superhero' genera, i.e. Marvel-comic-based-big-budget-action-flicks that are so prevalently spewed out of Hollywood today.  With all that nonsense aside, this movie remains as a simple story of a boy with not so simple powers.  In the classic sense, many may miss this point in the film. It is not in so how his powers came to be, but more in the sense of how he uses his ability to affect every other character in the movie.  At the end of the movie, simply asking yourself the question: What would each one of these characters in the movie be like without Donnie? may lead to answering some of those strange feelings you have when this movie is over.  Please don't watch this movie only once.  With each new viewing you gain hidden insight into what the director was trying to accomplish with this film. Also, don't go away from this movie confused, disappointed, or sad because 'I promise one day everything will be better for you.' 10/10",Null,0,0,17 June 2003
