The Blair Witch Project," Who said this was scary???
","First of all, Heather Donahue was so annoying that I wanted to throw things at the screen.  The majority of the film is dedicated to the three stars bitching and whining amongst themselves.  Then, when you think it's finally going to start to get good, it ends.I can't understand the great reviews this movie has gotten.  People were actually booing and hissing when the movie ended, and I've never seen that happen before.The hype over this film was SO much more interesting than the movie itself. The website is fantastic, but the movie was undeniably the worst I have ever seen...including cheesy 'B' films.",7,1,3,14 August 1999
World War Z," These Zombies Don't Follow the Rules!
","ZOMBIES DO NOT RUN. I don't care who you are...you don't get to turn zombies into lightning-fast ninja predators that make dinosaur noises, do the chicken dance, and could care less about eating brains. That just isn't right.Also...the filming was atrocious. They used all kinds of time lapse tricks with the zombies that just made it tough to watch. I'd love to know where all that money went, because it sure wasn't for special effects. The 3D was underused, but worth it.Granted, there were some spooky moments. The few zombie close-ups were intense and memorable, but the story was lacking. When the movie ends, you still have no idea WHY there was a zombie outbreak in the first place, but there is an obvious setup for sequels.I love zombie movies, books, and TV shows. I'm all for creativity, but ZOMBIES DO NOT RUN, dammit! They shamble. They shuffle. They walk. And they want BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINS.",6,2,5,29 June 2013
The Hills Have Eyes," Don't watch it right before bed!
","My husband did not make it past the first hour of this movie. I had to watch the rest alone. It is psychologically terrifying...one of those movies that takes hold of you, makes you scream at the screen, and leaves you with a disturbed feeling for hours after the final credits roll. There was nothing profound about the premise, and nothing Oscar-worthy about the acting, but it was an all-around great horror film. The special effects were good...lots of gore and violence. It's suspenseful, dark, and is guaranteed to leave you with a creepy feeling that won't let you go to sleep right after watching it. I watched three hours of SEINFELD reruns, and had nightmares anyway. That's the way it should be! ;)",8,43,65,7 August 2006
High Fidelity," I am not pleased.
","Maybe I hold John Cusack up to unrealistic standards.  I've fallen in love with every one of his movies since I was a teenager, so I had no reason to believe that this movie would be anything less than phenomenal.The movie is kind of...slow.  It was about two hours long, but by the last half hour I was praying for the end.I was expecting something funnier.  There were some really funny moments, but overall I would never call the film a comedy. Jack Black absolutely stole the show, and I truly believe that the movie would have been a complete disaster without him.The lead female role is annoying.  I spent the entire two hours wondering what she had been in before and why the hell she cut her bangs so short. (She's from Denmark, and hasn't been in anything I've ever seen.  I still don't know about the bangs.)There were a lot of references to obscure bands, which bothered me because I felt like I was missing the joke a lot of the time.I found myself laughing at things that were only slightly funny.  I think I was trying to justify spending $8.50 to see the movie, but I still left feeling ripped off and angry.",6,0,1,2 April 2000
