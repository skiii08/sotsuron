United 93," Not quite what I expected
","I (like so many others) was extremely skeptical before I went to see this film. My pre-conceptions pictured a huge Hollywood disaster movie walking over the tragic events of 9/11.The first 5 minutes had the audience quiet and expectant showing the kind of direction the film was going to take. It proved to be a far more personal film than expected, developing empathy and understanding of the characters. The plane passengers are matured and a sense of unity is created.The camera work and directing worked to set the mood and make it feel like a real experience. Whilst watching the film, I was drawn into a sense that this was just another day, and these people were normal people. It shows for example, the mundane activities of boarding a plane enforcing the reality by giving the associations we all experience on a flight.Overall, I found the film enjoyable and would recommend this to any film-goer. However, I did have some reservations whilst watching. Although the camera work was very effective in places, emphasising the ongoing confusion, I felt it rather dizzying. The film moves from scene to scene quickly yet build up seems abrasive and slow.Overall, I would give this film 7/10",7,1,2,3 June 2006
