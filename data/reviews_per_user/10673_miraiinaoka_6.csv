Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Pales a bit in comparison to Volume 1...
","Yes, each fight scene was impressive, but I felt like something in the bigger picture was missing from this film. It's pretty obvious from the title what happens in the end, so I was looking to get something more out of this film. The final bit of the film where Beatrix reunites with her estranged daughter at last and settles odds and ends with Bill wasn't exactly bad, I guess, but it was missing some spice. Plus, I was a bit confused during that scene when Beatrix is in pigtails and is sitting in a classroom, whereupon her name gets called by the teacher? To this day, I still don't understand what that scene was about. Other than that, the rest of the movie was pretty solid, definitely less blood than in Volume 1, and I liked how Elle Driver met her end, too. That came around full circle.",6,2,2,24 June 2019
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Seemingly endless supply of adventure!
","An oldie but a classic nonetheless! The score went perfectly well with the intense action that was going on for most of the movie, and the other sound effects were phenomenal as well, a typical Steven Spielberg feat. All of the actors played their part well, specifically the scene with the high speed chase through the desert where the Nazis were shook off the truck one by one by Jones' doing.",9,1,2,22 June 2019
Captain Marvel," Great first Marvel movie!
","Considering that this was the first Marvel movie I'd ever watched, I didn't need any prior knowledge to be able to fully understand the plot in this movie, which was really nice. The visual effects were absolutely amazing and all of the cast did a tremendous job portraying their roles! Would definitely recommend to people who've never seen any Marvel movies.",8,0,0,18 March 2019
Us," An unique plotline.
","I was pretty surprised when I read some of the reviews on here, because some people seemed to really dislike this movie, and though I didn't think that it was that bad, I have to say that I was a bit confused after watching this movie. I had to read several articles; interpretations in order to understand some of the messages that this movie was trying to portray, and the logic behind the twist/ending. I'm not exactly sure if a good movie is supposed to convey its meaning in a pretty obvious way, or if I'm just clueless, but after having watched this movie, all I thought was, 'That's it?' The ending came and went pretty abruptly, and I couldn't help but feel that I was missing something. Nonetheless, the actors in this movie, especially Nyong'o, did a spectacular job of portraying two very different characters. All in all, the concept in this movie was interesting, but it could have been executed in a way that caused a little less confusion.",6,1,1,22 June 2019
A Quiet Place," Clever use of sound (or lack thereof).
","The trailer for this movie did not disappoint! The manipulation of sound was a unique plot element that fit really well with the story. Focusing on one specific family and telling the story from their point of view was pretty good plotwise, but the movie definitely could have used a bit more action, such as incorporating more interactions with other people or forcing the family to move to another location for safety purposes. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski did an exceptional job of visibly portraying their fear of the monsters, as well as the child actors. It still amazes me that Evelyn was able to give birth so quietly in that situation; Blunt acted out that scene perfectly and with the right amount of emotion. Also, is it just me or did the monsters in this movie look oddly similar to the demagorgons from Stranger Things??",8,1,1,23 June 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Very bloody...
","Boy, was there a ton of blood shed in this movie! The movie started out in a really abrupt way but it wasn't so confusing that I couldn't figure out what was going on; from then on, the action progressed pretty rapidly, and never lagged at any point. Each of Beatrix's interactions with her former partners-in-crime of the Deadly Viper Association was unique and interesting to watch. Although Beatrix's physical capabilities were amazing throughout the movie, they were especially impressive when she knocked each and every member of the Crazy 88's gang with her newly acquired Hanzou sword. That must have taken a lot of training and time to perfect! During that scene, though brief, Gogo's movements were brutal and impressive as well, and she did indeed pull off the vengeful schoolgirl look very well. Finally, I liked how Bill had an aura of mystery surrounding him, which added to the thrill and excitement of this movie.",7,1,2,24 June 2019
